     Summary: The Twin Cities and a large area of Minnesota is in a winter storm warning for Monday and Tuesday, while a slice of far southern Minnesota is in an ice storm warning for the same period.
The heaviest snow with the biggest totals is expected in southwestern Minnesota, where more than a foot of snow is possible.
The official forecast in the Twin Cities calls for "heavy mixed precipitation" with total snow accumulations of 5-8 inches along with a few hundredths of an inch of ice.
Counties in the ice storm warning, which includes the cities of Mankato, Fairmont and Albert Lea, calls for 2-6 inches of snow along with "significant icing expected."
As seems to always be the case, the Twin Cities is in a zone of uncertainty because it's not totally clear when rain or mixed precipitation will change over to snow.
