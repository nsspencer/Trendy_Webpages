     S.W.A.T Team Enjoying How Bengals DBs Ruling The Jungle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: About 1,000 fans overran the place and they had to shut it down while the guys signed the S.W.A.T.
"We all love Lou Anarumo," says Wilcots of the Bengals defensive coordinator.
Dick LeBeau, of course, is the defensive coordinator from that '88 team who created the zone blitz largely out of Fulcher's once-in-a-generation versatility.
"How many times," Esiason asked, "did Fulcher and those guys make a play back there when we needed it?"
Vonn is trying to disrupt the play and take the ball away and that puts him in a class by himself."
