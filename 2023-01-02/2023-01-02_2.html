Burrow’s known for being calm, cool, and collected in these pivotal situations, and none has been higher for this Bengals team yet this season.
Ja’Marr Chase has fully returned to form since his injury, as over the last three weeks, he’s been targeted 39 times.

     S.W.A.T Team Enjoying How Bengals DBs Ruling The Jungle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: About 1,000 fans overran the place and they had to shut it down while the guys signed the S.W.A.T.
"We all love Lou Anarumo," says Wilcots of the Bengals defensive coordinator.
Dick LeBeau, of course, is the defensive coordinator from that '88 team who created the zone blitz largely out of Fulcher's once-in-a-generation versatility.
"How many times," Esiason asked, "did Fulcher and those guys make a play back there when we needed it?"
Vonn is trying to disrupt the play and take the ball away and that puts him in a class by himself."

     Summary: “I think he’s been hated by a lot of people, and he knows that, so he kind of plays that line very well.
You could say he’s playing the best ball of his career, but Apple — on brand — would argue with that.
“Eli’s gonna be Eli,” Bengals safety and former Ohio State and New Orleans teammate Vonn Bell said.

But yet he’s really doing a good job of approaching it the way he approaches it and not trying to be somebody else.

     Bengals vs. Bills: Time, how to watch, live stream, key matchups, prediction for 'Monday Night Football'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A key to executing this type of game plan against Buffalo is actually getting pressure with that three- or four-man rush.
The Bills are going to rely on their front four defenders to get pressure on Burrow, and make him uncomfortable.
Collins' backup, Hakeem Adeniji, is not nearly as strong in either the pass or run game as the man he is set to replace.
It doesn't seem like an advantageous matchup for the Cincinnati run game, but putting the ball in Burrow's hands is almost always their best chance of winning anyway.
Prediction: Bills 24, Bengals 21

     Five Bills vs. Bengals questions with Cincy Jungle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals are set to close out Week 17 tonight, with a Monday Night Football rumble in the jungle.
Plus, how should the Bills go about attacking Cincy’s defense, and is Buffalo’s run offense dangerous in Week 17?
For thoughts on that and those questions above, I spoke with Anthony Cosenza, Managing Editor/Podcaster with Cincy Jungle, ahead of tonight’s primetime showdown.
Most teams, quality lines, star backs and “traditional” rushing attacks have simply had trouble against the Bengals’ run defense.
Be sure to head over to Cincy Jungle to read my thoughts on this game and the Bills ahead of Monday Night Football!

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Buffalo Bills-Cincinnati Bengals game already had a ton on the line.
The Bills and Bengals, along with the Kansas City Chiefs, are all in play for the No.
The Bills are a 1.5-point favorite at BetMGM for what should be one of the games of the season.
Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow (9) leads his team into a huge game against the Bills.
There are four bowls on Monday: Mississippi State (-3) vs. Illinois in the ReliaQuest Bowl; Tulane vs. USC (-2.5) in the Cotton Bowl; LSU (-14.5) vs. Purdue in the Citrus Bowl; and then Penn State vs. Utah (-1.5) in the Rose Bowl.
