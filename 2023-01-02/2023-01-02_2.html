     Josh Allen Bengals Pal ‘Discrediting’ Bills QB Development?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bengals linebacker Logan Wilson is in no way being disrespectful when discussing the growth of Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, his former college teammate.
But …Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Logan Wilson admitted it’ll be “all love” between him and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen when Monday night’s meeting between their two teams at Paycor Stadium is over.
Wilson showed admiration for Allen’s development since entering the league, but admitted it’s a product of the Bills organization.
There’s a lot on the line Monday night in Cincinnati, but a classic Josh Allen hurdle over his former teammate could be the most poetic thing of all.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is unknown what he is dealing with, but it was reported that he banged it up during the Dolphins game.
Prediction: ACTIVEALSO LISTEDC Mitch MorseMorse left the Dolphins game early in the third quarter with a ‘concussion’.
DE Boogie BashamBoogie exited the Dolphins game with a ‘calf’ injury in the second half.
mayoclinic.orgLB Matt MilanoMilano was a surprise addition to the injury report with a ‘knee’ injury three weeks ago.
It was odd, as he played a 100% snap share against Patriots, Jets, and Dolphins (Weeks 13-15), even after going ‘DNP-DNP-Limited’ in practice Weeks 14 and 15.
