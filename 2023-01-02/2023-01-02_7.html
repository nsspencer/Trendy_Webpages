    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (KOLN) - The Nebraska State Patrol and Nebraska Department of Transportation are urging travelers to be prepared for winter driving conditions as a major winter storm impacts nearly all of Nebraska today and Tuesday.
The National Weather Service is predicting snowfall of approximately one foot in north central Nebraska with several inches expected in other areas.
“The ice accumulation with this storm may have a hidden impact when coupled with snow,” said Colonel John Bolduc, Superintendent of the Nebraska State Patrol.
“We urge all who intend to travel to check the forecast and current road conditions before heading out.
NDOT crews are already working across the state and will continue as the storm progresses.

     Winter storm hits Plains, Midwest with severe threat in South
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Extreme winter weather is set to batter the Plains and upper Midwest on Monday and Tuesday with heavy snow and power outages while potentially unleashing strong tornadoes in the South.
The big picture: This latest storm originated over the Pacific and crashed ashore along the West Coast as an atmospheric river event over the weekend.
Cities in the path of the severe weather on Monday include Memphis, Little Rock and Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The threat will shift eastward on Tuesday with intense snow of 1-to-2 inches per hour expected for southern South Dakota and southwest Minnesota, according to a National Weather Service online forecast discussion.
Why it matters: It’s poised to bring multiple hazards — including a severe winter threat — to the Central U.S. and significantly thwart travel once again this holiday season as ice accumulations make road conditions dangerous.

According to the Nation Weather Service, we could see ice accumulation and then a huge dumping of snow.
Forecasters predict anywhere from 10-18 inches of snow is possible.
Add that precipitation with the high likelihood of winds gusting as high as 40 mph, we’ll see travel conditions be very difficult to impossible.
Meteorologists note small fluctuations in the storm track are still possible, which could impact the forecast precipitation type and amounts.
