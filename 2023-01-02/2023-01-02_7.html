     Celine Dion Was Excluded From Rolling Stone's "200 Greatest Singers Of All Time" List. Her Fans Aren't Happy.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celine Dion was excluded from Rolling Stone's "200 Greatest Singers of All Time" list, and her fans are expressing their outrage over the decision to snub the five-time Grammy Award winner.
The list, published on New Year's Day, includes singers such as Aretha Franklin, Taylor Swift, Rosalia, Ozzy Osbourne, and Beyoncé.
"This new list was compiled our staff and key contributors, and it encompasses 100 years of pop music as an ongoing global conversation," Rolling Stone writes.
The decisions were based on "originality, influence, the depth of an artist's catalog, and the breadth of their musical legacy," the authors said.
"Before you start scrolling (and commenting), keep in mind that this is the Greatest Singers list, not the Greatest Voices List," they add.

     Summary: Fans cried foul last weekend when Rolling Stone left Celine Dion off the magazine’s 200 Greatest Singers of All Time list.
“Before you start scrolling (and commenting), keep in mind that this is the Greatest Singers list, not the Greatest Voices List,” the tweet said.
“Rolling Stone needs to immediately exit the business of music journalism,” said Twitter user mtl_vocalist.
Dion was recently forced to cancel her upcoming tour after discovering she suffers from a rare neurological disorder.
And, like Dion, Judy Garland and Cher didn’t make the cut at all, yet heavy metal wailer Ozzy Osbourne did.
