     New Year, New Snow – Winter Storm Warning Issued Until Tuesday Evening
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MARSHALL, MN (KMHL) — A Winter Storm Warning has been issued for the Marshall Radio listening area until Tuesday evening.
According to the Nation Weather Service, we could see ice accumulation and then a huge dumping of snow.
Forecasters predict anywhere from 10-18 inches of snow is possible.
Add that precipitation with the high likelihood of winds gusting as high as 40 mph, we’ll see travel conditions be very difficult to impossible.
Meteorologists note small fluctuations in the storm track are still possible, which could impact the forecast precipitation type and amounts.
