     Winter storm hits Plains, Midwest with severe threat in South
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Extreme winter weather is set to batter the Plains and upper Midwest on Monday and Tuesday with heavy snow and power outages while potentially unleashing strong tornadoes in the South.
The big picture: This latest storm originated over the Pacific and crashed ashore along the West Coast as an atmospheric river event over the weekend.
Cities in the path of the severe weather on Monday include Memphis, Little Rock and Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The threat will shift eastward on Tuesday with intense snow of 1-to-2 inches per hour expected for southern South Dakota and southwest Minnesota, according to a National Weather Service online forecast discussion.
Why it matters: It’s poised to bring multiple hazards — including a severe winter threat — to the Central U.S. and significantly thwart travel once again this holiday season as ice accumulations make road conditions dangerous.

     New Year, New Snow – Winter Storm Warning Issued Until Tuesday Evening
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MARSHALL, MN (KMHL) — A Winter Storm Warning has been issued for the Marshall Radio listening area until Tuesday evening.
According to the Nation Weather Service, we could see ice accumulation and then a huge dumping of snow.
Forecasters predict anywhere from 10-18 inches of snow is possible.
Add that precipitation with the high likelihood of winds gusting as high as 40 mph, we’ll see travel conditions be very difficult to impossible.
Meteorologists note small fluctuations in the storm track are still possible, which could impact the forecast precipitation type and amounts.
