     Patrick Mahomes Leads Peter King's NFL MVP Rankings, 49ers' Nick Bosa Enters Top 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thearon W. Henderson/Getty ImagesKansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes continues to separate himself from the field as the favorite to win the NFL's Most Valuable Player award, as Peter King of NBC Sports argued.
This alone is often enough to win MVP, but the fact Kansas City has completely rebuilt its receiving corps this year makes Mahomes' production even more impressive.
Hurts had been an MVP favorite for much of the year, but his recent injury has slowed momentum.
San Francisco 49ers pass-rusher Nick Bosa has also emerged as a contender, trying to become the first defensive player to win MVP since Lawrence Taylor in 1986.
Bosa leads the NFL with 17.5 sacks and is a major part of the league's No.
