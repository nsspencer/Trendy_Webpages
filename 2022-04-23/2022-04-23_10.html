     Cubs become first MLB team to score 20 runs this season in blowout win vs. Pirates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Cubs became the first MLB team to score 20-plus runs in a game so far this season on Saturday afternoon as part of a 21-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates (box score).
The Cubs notched 23 hits on the day, including at least one from all 10 batters who took a plate appearance.
Saturday marked the first time that Suzuki, signed over the offseason from Japan, recorded three hits in an MLB contest.
While the Cubs' hitters ran roughshod over the Pirates, their own pitching staff did an admirable job of keeping Pittsburgh off the board.
The Cubs are now 7-8 on the season, putting them into a tie with the Pirates for third place in the National League Central.
