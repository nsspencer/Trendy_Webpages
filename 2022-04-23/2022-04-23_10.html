     Confirmed Line-Ups: Manchester City vs Watford (Premier League)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City welcome a relegation-threatened Watford side to the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League this afternoon.
A win for the Blues would extend the gap at the top of the Premier League table to four points - albeit temporarily - and put Manchester City just five victories from securing a sixth league title.
Pep Guardiola described the knocks as 'niggles' and neither were set to be missing for too long.
However, the former was spotted in training on Friday alongside the rest of his Manchester City teammates, while Stones was missing from footage released by the club on Saturday morning.
With a one-point lead at the summit, Pep Guardiola and his team know there is no room for error in an intense title tussle with Liverpool.

     Man City vs Watford LIVE: Premier League result and reaction - Gabriel Jesus scores four
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Close Manchester City's best goals vs WatfordFour goals from Gabriel Jesus earned Manchester City a 5-1 win over relegation-threatened Watford on Saturday, a victory that moved Pep Guardiola’s side four points clear at the top of the Premier League standings.
However, a stunning strike from Rodri restored City’s two-goal advantage in the 34th minute before Jesus completed his first Premier League hat-trick early in the second half after converting from the penalty spot.
Not done there, the 25-year-old tapped home his fourth in the 53rd minute to complete the rout.
City took their foot off the gas from there on in, with Tuesday’s Champions League semi final first-leg against Real Madrid in mind.
The comprehensive victory moved champions City on to 80 points from 33 matches played, four clear of Liverpool ahead of Sunday’s Merseyside derby, while Watford head towards relegation, sitting 19th seven points from safety.

     Gabriel Jesus scores four as Man City rout Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gabriel Jesus has often flattered to deceive during his five-and-a-bit years at Manchester City.
That this was his first Premier League hat-trick in that time, despite playing in such a free-scoring team, is perhaps evidence that he has not quite delivered on his early promise.
Having allowed Watford back into the game once, City were not about to let it happen again and won a penalty just 14 seconds into the second half.
And still, a first league hat-trick secured, he was not finished there.
Five minutes later, Jesus finished off a flowing City counterattack by tucking De Bruyne’s pass inside the near post.

But the players up front, not just Gabriel for his incredible four goals, but all of them were brilliant.
Jesus may feel he's done enough to start against Real Madrid and, if nothing else, he's given Guardiola something to think about.
"If there's one person who deserves the best in life for him, his family and his friends, it's Gabriel," added Guardiola.
After a grueling season, City are potentially seven games away from a Premier League and Champions League double.
