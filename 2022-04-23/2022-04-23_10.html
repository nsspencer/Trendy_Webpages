     Rich man Elon Musk confronted rich man Bill Gates about shorting Tesla stock
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Finally, an Elon Musk Twitter story that doesn’t involve him potentially owning the website.
It all started earlier that evening, when an account called Whole Mars Catalog posted several screenshots allegedly showing a text exchange between Musk and Gates.
In the conversation, Musk asks Gates if he has a $500 million short stock position against Tesla.
Gates confirms he does, brings up the possibility of the two doing philanthropic work together, and is promptly shut down by Musk for, uh, hoping Tesla fails.
The original post made it clear that the veracity of the texts hadn’t been confirmed, but Musk did the thing Musk does and hopped in himself.

     Summary: Elon Musk seemed to poke fun at Bill Gates by posting a tweet with an emoji of a pregnant man.
In his next tweet, Musk wrote: "Shadow ban council reviewing tweet" and posted an image of dark figures.
The tweets follow leaked texts in which Gates turned down a philanthropic opportunity.
Musk posted it after screenshots of texts between the two billionaires were leaked by Twitter account @WholeMarsBlog, which Musk later confirmed were real.
The leaked texts show Musk asking Gates: "Do you still have a half billion dollar short position against Tesla?"

     Elon Musk Makes Crude Bill Gates Joke, Angry Over Tesla Shorts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk has ruffled feathers by comparing Bill Gates to an emoji addressing transgender people -- and it all seems to stem from a back-and-forth they had that left Elon pissed.
Of course, some were confused about the shot in the first place ... but leaked texts between Elon and Bill seem to paint a clearer picture about what's going on.
So apparently Bill Gates hit up @elonmusk to discuss “philanthropy on climate change” but Elon asked if he still had a half billion dollar short position on $TSLA.
Before that, though, Elon asked him straight up ... you shorting my company, bro?
Elon also argues that Tesla is doing a lot to mitigate climate change by investing in sustainable energy, so he sees Bill's position as hypocritical here.

     Summary: Tesla (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc Report CEO Elon Musk needs a meeting with his human resources department.
Now, Musk has engaged in a very high-profile fight with Microsoft (MSFT) - Get Microsoft Corporation Report Founder Bill Gates.
The conversation then took a major turn for the negative when Musk inquired about Gates holding a $500 million short position against Tesla.
To paraphrase Michelle Obama, Musk went low and Gates went high.
He did acknowledge holding that Tesla short position in his text exchange with Musk.

Musk responds “Great.”Another screenshot then displays a text, supposedly from Gates, which says “just landed” to which Musk responds “cool.”“Do you still have a half billion dollar short position against Tesla?” Musk asks.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 23, 2022Investing in bitcoinOne more topical issue has led to differences of opinion.
Gates doesn’t trust cryptocurrencies, and is wary of the fact that a comment from Elon Musk will make or break their value.
