     Orrin Hatch, Seven-Term Senator and a Republican Force, Dies at 88
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who crusaded for conservative causes and outlasted six presidents in a seven-term Senate career that corresponded to the rise of a right-wing movement in America, died on Saturday in Salt Lake City.
The Hatch Foundation confirmed his death in a statement.
Born into poverty in the Great Depression, one of nine children of a Pittsburgh metal worker, Mr. Hatch, who briefly aspired to the presidency and to a seat on the Supreme Court, had a grim Dickensian childhood.
He went to school in bib overalls, lost siblings in infancy and in World War II, and grew up in a crowded, ramshackle house without indoor plumbing.
In law school, he, his wife and children lived in a chicken coop that he and his father rebuilt behind his parents’ home.

     Orrin Hatch, longest-serving Republican U.S. senator, dies at 88
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Orrin Hatch, the longtime Republican senator from Utah, died Saturday in Salt Lake City at the age of 88, the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation announced.
“Senator Orrin G. Hatch personified the American Dream,” Matt Sandgren, executive director of the Hatch Foundation, said in a statement.
In November 2018, Hatch was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor, by President Donald Trump.
Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who at 41 years is among the top 10 longest-serving senators of all time, called Hatch a friend and said he was saddened by his death.
Funeral arrangements will be announced at a later date, the Hatch Foundation said.

     Summary: SALT LAKE CITY — Orrin G. Hatch, who became the longest-serving Republican senator in history as he represented Utah for more than four decades, died Saturday at age 88.
"In a nation divided, Orrin Hatch helped show us a better way by forging meaningful friendships on both sides of the aisle.
He became the Senate president pro tempore in 2015 when Republicans took control of the Senate.
Hatch helped usher through legislation toughening child pornography laws and making illegally downloading music a prosecutable crime.
Hatch faced a tough re-election battle from a conservative candidate in 2012, two years after a tea party wave carried longtime Utah Republican Sen. Bob Bennett out of office.
