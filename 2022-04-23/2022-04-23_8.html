     Summary: Finally, an Elon Musk Twitter story that doesn’t involve him potentially owning the website.
It all started earlier that evening, when an account called Whole Mars Catalog posted several screenshots allegedly showing a text exchange between Musk and Gates.
In the conversation, Musk asks Gates if he has a $500 million short stock position against Tesla.
Gates confirms he does, brings up the possibility of the two doing philanthropic work together, and is promptly shut down by Musk for, uh, hoping Tesla fails.
The original post made it clear that the veracity of the texts hadn’t been confirmed, but Musk did the thing Musk does and hopped in himself.

     Why Elon Musk Refuses To Work With Bill Gates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I heard from multiple people at TED that Gates still had half billion short against Tesla, which is why I asked him, so it’s not exactly top secret.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 23, 2022It’s nice to know that billionaires are keeping in touch with each other.
They were originally leaked by the New York Times, and Elon Musk also confirmed the discussion was real.
It got popular pretty fast, accruing over 122,000 likes in just a little under 35 minutes.Now you know why Elon Musk refuses to work with Bill Gates on reaching some climate goals.
He also owns a Porsche Taycan.“Having a short position” or “shorting stocks” means that an investor thinks a certain company's share will most likely lose some value.

     Tesla's Elon Musk Turns on Bill Gates Over Tesla Short
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc Report CEO Elon Musk thinks he's saving the world with his electric-vehicle and solar-power efforts (and he might be doing just that).
The Gates Foundation has a clear philosophy when it comes to how it plans to achieve its goals.
In the text chain, which Musk has confirmed as real, the Tesla CEO questioned Gates's commitment to the environment due to his Tesla short position.
He has made clear that he considers that a bet not just against his company but against its environmental efforts.
The Tesla CEO did (eventually) reverse his stand on both cryptocurrencies, dropping bitcoin as a way to pay for a Tesla.

     Elon Musk Makes Crude Bill Gates Joke, Angry Over Tesla Shorts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk has ruffled feathers by comparing Bill Gates to an emoji addressing transgender people -- and it all seems to stem from a back-and-forth they had that left Elon pissed.
Of course, some were confused about the shot in the first place ... but leaked texts between Elon and Bill seem to paint a clearer picture about what's going on.
So apparently Bill Gates hit up @elonmusk to discuss “philanthropy on climate change” but Elon asked if he still had a half billion dollar short position on $TSLA.
Before that, though, Elon asked him straight up ... you shorting my company, bro?
Elon also argues that Tesla is doing a lot to mitigate climate change by investing in sustainable energy, so he sees Bill's position as hypocritical here.
