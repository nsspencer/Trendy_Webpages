     40 Years Ago: ‘Fridays’ Stumbles to an Unfortunate End
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fridays was meant to be a looser, edgier alternative to Saturday Night Live.
Talents like Larry David, Rich Hall and Michael Richards would have to go elsewhere to find the successes they deserved.
Meanwhile, the Fridays cast was beginning to gel, and the scripts became more focused.
To critics like Shales, Fridays remained a "fanatically low-rated rip-off of Saturday Night Live" until the bitter end.
Maybe Larry David would have broken out.
