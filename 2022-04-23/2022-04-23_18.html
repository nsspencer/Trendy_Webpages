     France election: polls open as Macron and Le Pen battle for presidency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The polls have opened in mainland France for the second round of the presidential election in which voters will choose to give Emmanuel Macron another five years in office or elect Marine Le Pen.
Both he and Le Pen need to have convinced the almost 50% of voters who did not choose either of them in the first round ballot two weeks ago.
Le Pen will vote at Hénin-Beaumont, at the heart of her stronghold in northern France.
The polling stations close at 7pm in most of mainland France and 8pm in major towns and cities.
Mélenchon came a close third with 7.7m votes, 420,000 short of Le Pen.

     French Election Live Updates: Gloves Come Off as Voters Pick Macron or Le Pen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Le Pen and Mr. Macron will come to a head as the French choose their president for a five-year term.
Le Pen; he did not, however, endorse Mr. Macron, who moved right during his presidency and whose aloof assurance is often perceived as arrogance.
It has split into three blocs: the hard-line left, an amorphous center gathered around Mr. Macron and the extreme right of Marine Le Pen.
Le Pen is no longer an outlier.
If Mr. Macron does edge to victory, as polls suggest, he will face a restive, divided country, where hatred of him is not uncommon.

     Le Pen challenges Macron in French presidential runoff watched around the world
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the first-round vote on April 10, Macron received 28 percent of the vote share, and Le Pen 23 percent.
A runoff win by Le Pen, 53, would put an anti-immigrant populist in charge of the European Union’s second-biggest economy and its only nuclear power.
French President Emmanuel Macron is trying to fend off a victory from far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in the presidential election on April 24.
Supporting the far right was unthinkable for many in France at the time Le Pen took the party over from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who was known for xenophobia and for calling Nazi gas chambers just a “detail” of World War II.
Le Pen renamed the party from National Front to National Rally in 2018.

     Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen face off again, with France's future direction at stake
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Le Pen, 53, has put forward an economically nationalist, more inward-looking platform that would represent a fundamental shift from the direction France has taken since the end of World War II.
Macron bested Le Pen in that vote by nearly two to one.
Macron's attempts at diplomacy took him away from the campaign trail, while Le Pen was forced to backtrack on her previous support for Vladimir Putin.
However, critics say Le Pen's campaign has not adequately explained how Paris will pay for many of the solutions being proposed.

     Not just exit polls: Why French election projections are almost always correct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Projections and preliminary results won’t be known until after the last polling stations close at 8pm.
On election day, polling stations in mainland France close at 7pm in most places and at 8pm in the larger cities including Paris.
Unlike in most other democracies, where those projections are based on exit polls, French pollsters base their estimates on ballots that have actually been counted.
“We also use exit polls in France, for instance to evaluate each candidate’s level of support by age group or profession,” he says.
In polling stations sampled by Ipsos and its peers, an official calls the pollster after every 100 ballots counted to report the results.
