     Summary: The second — and final — round of voting sees centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron face off against nationalist and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
The second — and final — round of voting sees centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron face off against nationalist and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
A poll out Thursday predicted that Macron would win the second round with 55% of the votes, with Le Pen on 45%.
"Opinion polls now give Macron a 55% to 45% edge over Le Pen.
Le Pen has softened her rhetoric toward the European Union since 2017.

     Explainer: The second round of the French election
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Opinion polls point to Macron as the likely winner but with a much smaller margin than in 2017.
Sunday’s second round of the French presidential election will determine who governs France for the next five years: Pro-European centrist President Emmanuel Macron or the far-right, anti-immigration candidate Marine Le Pen.
Le Pen winning cannot be ruled out, though it is the least likely of the two scenarios.
If Macron wins, he will face a difficult second mandate as president.
If Le Pen wins, a radical change in France’s domestic and international policies can be expected, as well as street protests that could start immediately.

     Summary: The question is a hard one, especially for leftist voters who dislike Macron but don’t want to see Le Pen in power either.
“So if you want to avoid the unthinkable ... choose for yourself,” he urged hesitant French voters.
Le Pen has consolidated her place on France's political scene, the result of a years-long effort to rebrand herself as less extreme.
Le Pen "has this lack of credibility," he said.

     Why the French election matters so much in US
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Le Pen is seen as close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and has signaled there would be a shift in France’s policies on the Russian war in Ukraine if she is elected.
The U.S. establishment is clearly hoping for a Macron victory, though the Biden administration publicly has said it is watching the election closely and emphasized the contest is a decision for the French people.
“​​I’m just not going to get ahead of an election in a foreign country,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier this month.
A Le Pen win would be widely seen as a victory for Russia and a defeat for the United States and NATO.
The top issue for French voters is so-called purchasing power, the rise in cost of everyday goods, gas and energy.

     Summary: A Le Pen victory would have big implications for European security following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Putin linksIn a fiery televised debate Wednesday, incumbent President Emmanuel Macron sought to highlight links between Marine Le Pen’s far-right party and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“For our country, this is bad news, because you depend on the Russian regime and you depend on Putin.,” Macron said.
NATO changesWhat would a Le Pen presidency mean for Europe’s security at a time of conflict?
It seems to me that’s what the British understood well,” Le Pen said.
