     Summary: Orrin Hatch, longtime Republican Utah senator, dies at 88Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/APSALT LAKE CITY — Orrin G. Hatch, who became the longest-serving Republican senator in history as he represented Utah for more than four decades, died Saturday at age 88.
"In a nation divided, Orrin Hatch helped show us a better way by forging meaningful friendships on both sides of the aisle.
He became the Senate president pro tempore in 2015 when Republicans took control of the Senate.
Hatch helped usher through legislation toughening child pornography laws and making illegally downloading music a prosecutable crime.
Hatch faced a tough re-election battle from a conservative candidate in 2012, two years after a tea party wave carried longtime Utah Republican Sen. Bob Bennett out of office.
