     Orrin Hatch, Seven-Term Senator and a Republican Force, Dies at 88
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who crusaded for conservative causes and outlasted six presidents in a seven-term Senate career that corresponded to the rise of a right-wing movement in America, died on Saturday in Salt Lake City.
The Hatch Foundation confirmed his death in a statement.
Born into poverty in the Great Depression, one of nine children of a Pittsburgh metal worker, Mr. Hatch, who briefly aspired to the presidency and to a seat on the Supreme Court, had a grim Dickensian childhood.
He went to school in bib overalls, lost siblings in infancy and in World War II, and grew up in a crowded, ramshackle house without indoor plumbing.
In law school, he, his wife and children lived in a chicken coop that he and his father rebuilt behind his parents’ home.

     Summary: Former U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican in Senate history and the longest-serving senator from Utah, died Saturday.

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., remembered Hatch for his bipartisanship.
"Senator Hatch was kind to me and we worked together well," she said in a statement Saturday.
"So sad to hear of the death of Orrin Hatch," former U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said in a tweet Saturday night.

Hatch, who became the longest-serving Republican senator in history as he represented Utah for more than four decades, died Saturday at age 88.
"In a nation divided, Orrin Hatch helped show us a better way by forging meaningful friendships on both sides of the aisle.
He became the Senate president pro tempore in 2015 when Republicans took control of the Senate.
Hatch helped usher through legislation toughening child pornography laws and making illegally downloading music a prosecutable crime.
Hatch faced a tough re-election battle from a conservative candidate in 2012, two years after a tea party wave carried longtime Utah Republican Sen. Bob Bennett out of office.

“I’m approving the Bears Ears recommendation for you, Orrin,” Trump told him in a 2017 phone call, Mr. Hatch reported.
