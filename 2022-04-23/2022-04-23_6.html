     A ‘Catalyst’ From the Start, Miguel Cabrera Reaches 3,000 Hits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The very best players make a manager want to change the rules.
Specifically, one rule: that pesky requirement for a lineup, which mandates that each hitter take his turn.
When Miguel Cabrera is on your team, the waiting is the hardest part.
“I wish he could have come to bat every inning,” said Jack McKeon, 91, on the phone this week from his home in North Carolina.
“He’d hit a sacrifice fly, he’d hit a home run, he’d get a base hit, even to the point where he hit the ground ball that what’s-his-name booted in the Bartman game.

     Miguel Cabrera joins 3,000 hit club vs. Rockies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tigers legend and future Hall of Famer Miguel Cabrera joined the 3,000 hit club on Saturday against the Rockies, cementing his spot as the 33rd member of the illustrious list.
After recording his 2,999th hit on Wednesday night against Yankees, Cabrera was asked about potentially reaching his 3,000th hit against New York on Thursday.
“A scout from the Yankees told me, ‘If you make it, it’s going to be as a pitcher.’ He got fired,’” Cabrera joked.
Ultimately, Cabrera went 0-for-3 with an intentional walk in the eighth inning of Thursday’s game that set the baseball world abuzz, which led to Cabrera reaching the historic milestone this weekend against the Rockies instead.
Despite all of the talk about the hits record, Cabrera has remained instead on helping the Tigers win games.

     Detroit Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera joins MLB's vaunted 3,000-hit club
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Detroit Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera entered the vaunted 3,000-hit club Saturday with an opposite field single in his first at-bat at home against the Colorado Rockies.
The 39-year-old Venezuelan, in his 20th season, is the 33rd player to reach the milestone in the 119-year-old history of Major League Baseball.
The hit, off Rockies righty and fellow Venezuelan Antonio Senzatela, comes one season another career milestone -- Cabrera's 500th home run.
He then exchanged a hug with Rockies shortstop Jose Iglesias, a friend and former Tigers teammate.
Cabrera joins Henry Aaron, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols, Willie Mays, Rafael Palmeiro, and Eddie Murray as the only players in history to amass 3,000 career hits and 500 home runs.

Cabrera hit his 500th home run last August.

     Summary: You had to know it was coming.
With BreakingT having a finger on the pulse of big sports moments, there was no way they were going to miss out on a 3000 hit shirt, and with Miguel Cabrera making the moment a huge (and emotional) one on Saturday afternoon, the t-shirt company wasted no time releasing their new Mr. 3000 shirt.
Obviously the tee pays homage to the iconic movie cover of the Bernie Mac comedy Mr. 3000, but unlike the movie, Miguel Cabrera won’t have to come out of retirement to make his record hit (and hopefully won’t retire immediately after today’s game to open a mini-mall).
And while you’re here you might as well watch the magical moment one more time.
I’m sure we’ll all be watching this on repeat for the rest of the weekend.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Saturday afternoon, as he has done countless times before, Miguel Cabrera ripped a single through the right side of the infield.
He was widely regarded as an elite prospect, but quickly exceeded the hype by propelling the club to the 2003 World Series title.
With the Tigers in the early 2010s, Cabrera established himself as the very best hitter on the planet.
Aside from 2018, he has played enough to qualify for the batting title in every season (he won the American League batting title in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015).
The milestone moved Cabrera into a tie with Roberto Clemente for 32nd place on the all-time MLB hits list.
