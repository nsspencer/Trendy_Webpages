     Miguel Cabrera joins 3,000 hit club vs. Rockies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tigers legend and future Hall of Famer Miguel Cabrera joined the 3,000 hit club on Saturday against the Rockies, cementing his spot as the 33rd member of the illustrious list.
After recording his 2,999th hit on Wednesday night against Yankees, Cabrera was asked about potentially reaching his 3,000th hit against New York on Thursday.
“A scout from the Yankees told me, ‘If you make it, it’s going to be as a pitcher.’ He got fired,’” Cabrera joked.
Ultimately, Cabrera went 0-for-3 with an intentional walk in the eighth inning of Thursday’s game that set the baseball world abuzz, which led to Cabrera reaching the historic milestone this weekend against the Rockies instead.
Despite all of the talk about the hits record, Cabrera has remained instead on helping the Tigers win games.

     A ‘Catalyst’ From the Start, Miguel Cabrera Reaches 3,000 Hits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The very best players make a manager want to change the rules.
Specifically, one rule: that pesky requirement for a lineup, which mandates that each hitter take his turn.
When Miguel Cabrera is on your team, the waiting is the hardest part.
“I wish he could have come to bat every inning,” said Jack McKeon, 91, on the phone this week from his home in North Carolina.
“He’d hit a sacrifice fly, he’d hit a home run, he’d get a base hit, even to the point where he hit the ground ball that what’s-his-name booted in the Bartman game.

     Summary: Miguel Cabrera is the 1st Venezuelan-born player to get 3,000 hits in MLB historyEnlarge this image toggle caption Carlos Osorio/AP Carlos Osorio/APDetroit Tigers star Miguel "Miggy" Cabrera has batted his way into MLB history with 3,000 hits.
Cabrera became the 33rd player in the league to reach the mark during the first inning in a game against the Colorado Rockies on Saturday.
If his 20-season MLB resume didn't cut it, his latest feat almost certainly makes him Hall of Fame material.
Of the 33 players who've hit 3,000, only six have not been inducted into the Hall of Fame.
3,000, Cabrera joked that he would probably bunt his next hit — which he has done only once in his MLB career.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Saturday afternoon, as he has done countless times before, Miguel Cabrera ripped a single through the right side of the infield.
He was widely regarded as an elite prospect, but quickly exceeded the hype by propelling the club to the 2003 World Series title.
With the Tigers in the early 2010s, Cabrera established himself as the very best hitter on the planet.
Aside from 2018, he has played enough to qualify for the batting title in every season (he won the American League batting title in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015).
The milestone moved Cabrera into a tie with Roberto Clemente for 32nd place on the all-time MLB hits list.
