     Court-martial results in first conviction of general officer in Air Force history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington, DC (CNN) A US Air Force general officer was found guilty of abusive sexual contact in military court in Ohio on Saturday, marking the first-ever court-martial trial and conviction of a general officer in the history of the military branch, the Air Force said in a statement.
Maj. Gen. William T. Cooley was found guilty on one of three specifications of sexual assault connected to a 2018 incident in New Mexico, according to the Air Force release.
According to the Air Force statement, the unnamed victim said in court testimony that "Cooley asked for a ride after a backyard day-long social event."
It continued: "During the short ride she said he told her that he fantasized about having sex with her.
She alleged he pressed her up against the driver's side window, forcibly kissed and groped her through her clothes."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Ohio — An Air Force major general in Ohio has been convicted by a military judge of one of three specifications of abusive sexual contact in the first-ever military trial of an Air Force general.
The charge faced by Maj. Gen. William Cooley during the weeklong court-martial at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio had three specifications, one alleging a forcible kiss and two alleging forcible touching in 2018.
Cooley had the option of a trial by court member jurors or by military judge, and chose to have the case heard by the judge.
“Today marks the first time an Air Force general officer has been held responsible for his heinous actions,” the woman’s attorney Ryan Guilds, said in a statement, the Dayton Daily News reported.
“This case clearly demonstrates the commitment of Air Force leaders to fully investigate the facts and hold Airmen of any rank accountable for their actions when they fail to uphold Air Force standards,” Col. Eric Mejia, staff judge advocate for Air Force Materiel Command, said in a statement.

     First-ever US Air Force trial of a general finds William Cooley guilty of sexual misconduct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the first-ever military trial for a general in the 75-year history of the US air force, a two-star general was found guilty Saturday of abusive sexual contact for forcibly kissing his sister-in-law after a family barbecue.
Maj Gen William Cooley faces up to seven years in prison, a dishonorable discharge and the loss of his air force pay and benefits at a sentencing hearing scheduled for Monday.
In the family note, Cooley reportedly wrote of being stunned that he hurt the couple “for his own selfish ego”.
The air force removed Cooley as commander of the branch’s prestigious research lab at Wright-Patterson air force base in Ohio in January 2020 after the woman reported him to the branch.
A statement from Eric Mejia, a colonel and staff judge advocate for Air Force Material Command, to the Associated Press said Saturday’s verdict “clearly demonstrates the commitment of air force leaders to fully investigate the facts and hold airmen of any rank accountable for their actions when they fail to uphold air force standards”.

Cooley was fired from his research laboratory position in January 2020 after an Air Force investigation and has worked in an administrative job since then.
Over the course of the investigation, CBS News spoke with nearly two dozen survivors of sexual assault, whistleblowers who worked for the military's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program and families of suicide victims who say the military grossly mishandled reports of sexual assault.

     Summary: WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Ohio — A military judge convicted Maj. Gen. Bill Cooley of sexually assaulting his sister-in-law in 2018, closing out Saturday the historic first full court-martial of an Air Force general.
Col. Christina Jimenez, who is presiding over the bench trial, is expected to sentence the former Air Force Research Laboratory commander on Monday.
This is the first time a military court has issued a verdict in a case involving an Air Force general.
Air Force Times does not publish the names of sexual assault victims without their permission to protect their privacy.
The service is committed to holding all airmen accountable for conduct that falls short of Air Force standards, he said.
