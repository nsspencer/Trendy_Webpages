     Gabriel Jesus Scores Four Goals As Man City Thrash Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If this is to be his final season at the Etihad Stadium then Gabriel Jesus delivered Manchester City a very welcome goodbye gift.
But Jesus was in Guardiola's starting XI for Saturday's Premier League game against Watford.
And he delivered four goals and an assist inside the first 53 minutes as City maintained their status as Premier League title favorites with a 5-1 win.
Jesus had only scored three Premier League goals all season before prime relegation candidates Watford came to Manchester.
Jesus has already won seven major trophies with City, who are in contention to claim this season's Champions League as well as the Premier League.

     Man City vs Watford LIVE: Premier League result and reaction - Gabriel Jesus scores four
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Close Manchester City's best goals vs WatfordFour goals from Gabriel Jesus earned Manchester City a 5-1 win over relegation-threatened Watford on Saturday, a victory that moved Pep Guardiola’s side four points clear at the top of the Premier League standings.
However, a stunning strike from Rodri restored City’s two-goal advantage in the 34th minute before Jesus completed his first Premier League hat-trick early in the second half after converting from the penalty spot.
Not done there, the 25-year-old tapped home his fourth in the 53rd minute to complete the rout.
City took their foot off the gas from there on in, with Tuesday’s Champions League semi final first-leg against Real Madrid in mind.
The comprehensive victory moved champions City on to 80 points from 33 matches played, four clear of Liverpool ahead of Sunday’s Merseyside derby, while Watford head towards relegation, sitting 19th seven points from safety.

But the players up front, not just Gabriel for his incredible four goals, but all of them were brilliant.
Jesus may feel he's done enough to start against Real Madrid and, if nothing else, he's given Guardiola something to think about.
"If there's one person who deserves the best in life for him, his family and his friends, it's Gabriel," added Guardiola.
After a grueling season, City are potentially seven games away from a Premier League and Champions League double.
