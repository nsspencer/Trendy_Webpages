     Stormy Night Across Oklahoma Prompts Several Tornado Warnings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saturday, April 23rd 2022, 11:41 pmBy: News 9A line of severe thunderstorms moved across central Oklahoma Saturday night prompting several tornado warnings throughout the evening, and a new severe thunderstorm watch has been issued for most of central Oklahoma overnight, until 4 a.m.
The storm in eastern Oklahoma County produced a possible, brief tornado near Tinker Air Force Base.
Early iterations of the storms produced tornado warnings for the Stillwater area, and a menacing storm produced quite a bit of concern for southwest parts of the Oklahoma City metro area and Moore.
A dryline pushed across central Oklahoma, making the atmosphere unstable and opening us up to some strong storms.
Some of those storms could work their way back into the Oklahoma City metro.
