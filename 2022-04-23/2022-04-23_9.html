     Bayern Munich wins 10th consecutive Bundesliga title after beating Borussia Dortmund
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Bayern Munich clinched its 10th straight Bundesliga title after beating fierce rivals Borussia Dortmund 3-1 on Saturday.
It is the first club in Europe's top five leagues to win 10 consecutive titles.
The beer was flowing as Bayern's players celebrated on the pitch, with teammates throwing the iconic steins over each other at full-time.
The German powerhouse secured the league title after opening up a 12-point gap with three games remaining, underlining its dominance over the past decade.
Julian Nagelsmann's team knew a win against Dortmund in Saturday's Der Klassiker would be enough, and it raced into a 2-0 lead before half-time.

Gnabry put the ball in the net again on the half-hour mark but his effort was ruled offside.
League top scorer Lewandowski did better in the 34th when Gnabry gained possession and Mueller fed the Pole who slotted in through the legs of Hitz for his 33rd league goal.
Dortmund were awarded a penalty at the start of the second half when Marco Reus was felled by Joshua Kimmich and Can converted it.

     Summary: Completing an unprecedented decade of dominance, Bayern Munich has won the German Bundesliga title for the 10th season in a row.
And if there were any year for Bayern to fumble its hold on the title, it was this one.
After a legendary season where he broke Gerd Müller’s longtime Bundesliga single-season goalscoring record, Lewandowski returned with another incredible campaign.
A seventh scoring title would tie Müller for the most in Bundesliga history.
The Polish international set a new Bayern record by scoring in 19 consecutive games, a mark that carried over from the end of last season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the side of the hosts, Bayern Munich will really need to show their fans that they are still a top team.
With this match, Bayern Munich have a chance to demonstrate their strength above all other German teams by beating their biggest title rivals in Borussia Dortmund.
Borussia Dortmund is out of Europe, firmly in second place, and without much of a title aspiration at this point.
Borussia Dortmund, on the other hand, had all of their momentum halted by a 4-1 defeat to RB Leipzig at home.
Bayern Munich will win and basically guarantee their tenth title in a row, a record for the Bundesliga.
