     How Arsenal overcame Manchester United at The Emirates: Analysis and recap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal took another huge step towards Champions League qualification with a crucial 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Emirates Stadium.
United almost responded immediately after Ronaldo slipped a through ball into the path of Anthony Elanga, who failed to convert his one-on-one effort.
Bruno Fernandes missed a good chance for United before Elanga saw a penalty appeal turned down, as the tide began to swing.
Ten minutes into the second period United were awarded a penalty after Tavares handled the ball in the area, but Fernandesâ€™ weak penalty struck the post.
United continued to look threatening and just after the hour mark Ronaldo had a goal chalked off.
