     Danny Green Discusses Key Reason Sixers Could Use Sweep vs. Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unfortunately, the Sixers came up short during their Game 4 matchup and couldn't complete the series until they won at home for Game 5.
As Philadelphia has gained a significant 3-0 lead over the fifth-seeded Toronto Raptors, they could put the series away for good with a win on Saturday afternoon.
Danny Green Stresses Importance of a SweepFollowing a Friday afternoon shootaround in Toronto, Sixers veteran forward Danny Green addressed reporters to discuss the possibility of the Sixers sweeping their Atlantic Division rivals in the first round.
According to Sixers Wire's Ky Carlin, Green highlights rest and recovery as a reason why the Sixers could use the additional time off.
Therefore, Embiid, Green, and the Sixers will look to do all they can to put the Raptors away once and for all on Saturday.

     Sixers at Raptors: Joel Embiid plays through thumb injury, Toronto takes Game 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: pic.twitter.com/8VvQcDrjH1 — Rich Hofmann (@rich_hofmann) April 23, 2022These were Doc Rivers' comments when asked about Joel Embiid's thumb before today's Game 4 in Toronto.
Embiid threw a nice pass from the nail to Shake Milton in the corner, and Milton’s three-pointer made it 16-13 Sixers.
Embiid had a bit more offensive success in the second quarter, although his thumb pain was readily apparent.
They bested the Sixers in points off turnovers (22-3) and fast-break points (21-10) by substantial margins.
Regardless of his availability moving forward, Toronto has shown that it's a resilient team and a Sixers series win isn't cemented quite yet.

     Offense sputters as Sixers fail to sweep Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That streak will remain as their offense sputtered in a 110-102 loss to the Raptors at ScotiaBank Arena Saturday afternoon.
There’s a physicality on both ends from Harris that the Raptors haven’t matched.
When James Harden left the floor, everything was kept to the outside.
Not the greatest first quarter, but if this was the Raptors’ best punch to keep their season alive, the Sixers are in great shape.
Similar to Game 3, the Sixers didn’t get off to a great start, but are still very much in this game.

     Sixers' Joel Embiid dealing with thumb sprain, scores 21 in Game 4 loss vs. Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid has a right thumb injury but played in Saturday’s Game 4 loss against the Toronto Raptors.
He finished with 21 points, eight rebounds and three assists in the 110-102 defeat in Toronto.
After the game, the Sixers star told reporters that he believes he will be able to play throughout his team’s playoff run, despite experiencing pain throughout.
Embiid is expected to have an MRI on his injured thumb on Sunday but will hold off on surgery (if necessary) until the playoffs are over.
— Tim Bontemps (@TimBontemps) April 23, 2022The NBA’s leading scorer played through a sore right thumb during Game 3, and multiple reports say the source of that pain was suspected to be a torn ligament.

     Instant observations: Sixers lay an egg in Game 4 loss to Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Sixers collectively failed to show up in a Game 4 loss to Toronto, with the Raptors keeping the series alive in a 110-102 loss for Philadelphia.
Excuse it because of the 2 p.m. start if you want, but the Sixers simply did not come prepared to play in this game.
It's not like the Raptors did anything off-script, changing their identity in one last desperate act to save their season.
This is who they have been and are, and the Sixers seemingly forgot that four games into a series.
Normally, I would criticize Doc Rivers for the way the offense skewed in this game, going heavy on post-ups with a center whose hand is not in top shape.
