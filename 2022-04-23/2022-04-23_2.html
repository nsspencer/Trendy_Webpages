     Arsenal vs Man Utd LIVE: Premier League result and reaction - Granit Xhaka goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✕ Close Manchester United Appoint Erik Ten Hag As New ManagerFollow live reaction after Arsenal dealt a blow to Manchester United’s hopes of a top-four Premier League finish as Nuno Tavares, Bukayo Saka and Granit Xhaka struck in a 3-1 win that revived the home side’s chances of Champions League football next season.
Saka doubled the Gunners’ lead from the penalty spot after a foul on the winger in the build-up to a disallowed goal by Eddie Nketiah.
Nketiah’s strike was ruled offside by the Video Assistant Referee.
The Portuguese forward’s 100th Premier League goal came after a traumatic week personally for the player after the death of one of his newborn twin babies.
United improved after the restart but their woes deepened as skipper Bruno Fernandes hit the post with a poor effort from the penalty spot following Tavares’ handball, before a 70th-minute thunderbolt from Xhaka sealed the win for the Gunners.
