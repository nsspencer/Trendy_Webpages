     What Robert Williams' potential Game 3 return means for Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Celtics, already gushing with confidence after holding serve in the first two games of an Eastern Conference first-round series against the Brooklyn Nets, are poised to get another jolt with the impending return of Robert Williams.
The Celtics upgraded Williams to questionable for Saturday’s Game 3 in Brooklyn and, barring a setback, there is hope within the organization that Williams can play a limited role in a return to the court.
The Celtics will tread cautiously with reintegrating Williams, but there is no fear that an expedited return might aggravate his knee ailment.
There will be obvious rust from a months-long absence, but Williams’ return feels a bit like the final infinity stone for a Celtics starting five that has been a steamroller during the 2021-22 regular season.
There’s something to be said for the way the Celtics and Nets have navigated the return-from-injury process for Williams and Ben Simmons.

     Celtics Gearing Up for Rob Williams’ Potential Game 3 Return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If Rob Williams’ recovery from a partial left meniscectomy on March 30 went as well as initially projected, then his earliest estimated return date would have been April 27 – just in time for Game 5 of Boston’s first-round playoff series with the Brooklyn Nets.
However, it appears that Williams’ recovery didn’t go as expected; it went far better than anyone could have hoped.
“The four-to-six-week time frame is a broad one and everyone reacts differently,” Udoka said following Saturday’s shootaround in Brooklyn.
“The fact that he’s making strides to get back shows he’s doing everything the right way with the rehab to get back,” said Boston’s starting point guard.
“Rob is a big key part to that defense,” said Smart, the Defensive Player of the Year.

     Summary: Kendrick Perkins: Rob Williams makes C's favorite to win it all originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonAlready up 2-0 in their first-round series vs. the Brooklyn Nets, the Boston Celtics are about to get a major boost.
The plan is for big man Robert Williams to return for Saturday night's Game 3 at Barclays Center.
So, just how big of an impact would a healthy Williams have on the Celtics for the rest of the playoffs?
"Robert Williams coming back to this Celtics team, the way that they're playing right now, (they're) my favorite to win it all," Perkins said on ESPN.
The Celtics enter Game 3 with the third-best odds (+500) to win the 2022 NBA championship, per PointsBet Sportsbook.
