     The Chicago Bulls' 30-Point Loss In Game 3 Is The Biggest Playoff Home Loss In Franchise History
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bulls lost by 30 points to the Milwaukee Bucks on their home court in Game 3.
According to the Twitter page StatMuse, that loss was the biggest playoff home loss in franchise history.
There is no doubt that the Milwaukee Bucks came out hungry to win this game, and it definitely paid off.
Chicago Bulls guard Alex Caruso even warned his teammates that the Bucks would come out hungrier "just naturally".
It is clear that the Chicago Bulls were simply unable to match the Milwaukee Bucks' energy.

     The Chicago Bulls were outplayed by one bitter enemy in particular
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What didn’t help was the fact that maybe the most hated Bucks player was having himself a night.
Grayson Allen single-handedly ripped the heart out of Chicago Bulls fans and took life out of the United Center.
Of course, Allen’s infamous foul on Alex Caruso earlier in the season made him easy for Bulls fans to hate.
Throughout the rest of the game, Allen was aggressive going to the bucket on occasion and made some rather impressive finishes.
Not a single Bulls player outscored Allen, nor did they come close to his +15 in the plus/minus category.

     Milwaukee vs. Chicago Game Three: Winning Cures All
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No Khris Middleton, no problem for Friday night’s Milwaukee Bucks, as they absolutely dismantled the Chicago Bulls on the defensive end of the court, while showing improved offensive flow en route to a decisive 111-81 win.
In a twist of fate, the third quarter was friendly to the Bucks, holding Chicago to just 18 points as they built up a 90-59 lead.
This was the type of Bucks defense we expected to see all series, holding them to an 84.6 offensive rating.
Offensively though, Allen found some groove early on with three made triples and stripping Caruso while driving to the rim.
— Eric Nehm (@eric_nehm) April 23, 2022Another offensive foul on Giannis Antetokounmpo - his second this game.

     Bulls routed by Bucks in Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bulls wanted to make sure they got the attention of the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks.
That's right, the Bulls had a 3-2 lead... and it was pretty much all Bucks from there and back to Bucks home court advantage.
Though in the second quarter, Bulls lead scorer Nikola Vucevic with 19 points set a heck of a screen on...
They had just 10 turnovers for seven Bulls points and held the Bulls, forced to shoot mostly jump shots and not particularly well, to 30 interior points.
Even the shots the Bulls made were difficult, and the Bucks with the rebounding edge kept the Bulls from much transition play.
