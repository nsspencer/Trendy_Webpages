The Celtics managed to fend off their opponents in a 109-103 win, and took a commanding 3-0 chokehold on the Nets.

     Boston Celtics Hall of Fame forward Larry Bird's best highlights: Volume VI
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While we have not seen as much of the legendary Boston Celtics counterpart to Los Angeles Lakers icon Earvin “Magic” Johnson in the hit HBO NBA basketball series “Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,” but Hall of Fame small forward Larry Joe Bird played an important foil to the Los Angeles title teams of the 1980s.
Better known as the ‘Showtime” Lakers, the team joined the Celtics, through the on-court wizardry of Magic and Bird, to help revitalize a moribund NBA in the early 1980s.
With many younger Boston fans becoming aware of that era of play and the Celtics’ own titles teams of that decade, it behooves us to share more highlights of Larry Legend and his play with the Boston teams from that era.
And since December of 2021, NBC Boston Sports has been putting out the best of Bird’s highlights, now up to its sixth edition.

     The Top 5 Plays from Game 3 Between the Celtics and Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From Daniel Theis' thunderous throwdown to Derrick White's touchdown pass to Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown turning a steal into a two-handed flush at the other end, then burying a deep three and losing Patty Mills on a step-back jumper, here are the top five plays from Game 3 between the Celtics and Nets.
Daniel Theis' Thunderous ThrowdownThe Nets are in a zone defense that initially kept the Celtics from getting in a rhythm offensively.
But in the play above, when Jayson Tatum drives, Andre Drummond is solely focused on preventing him from getting to the rim.
Derrick White's Touchdown to TatumIt starts with a missed three by Bruce Brown and the Celtics keeping the Nets off the glass.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On this day in Boston Celtics history, Celtics point guard luminary Bob Cousy finished his career with the Celtics with a bang in 1963, defeating the longtime Boston rival Los Angeles Lakers 112 – 109 in Game 6 of the NBA Finals four that year, securing Boston’s fifth consecutive NBA championship.
Cousy scored 18 points, 3 rebounds, and 7 assists in his final game as a Celtic, shooting 8-of-16 from the floor.
The Holy Cross product played for 13 seasons with Boston, virtually his entire career apart from seven games as player-coach for the Cincinnati Royals in the 1969-70 season.
He would win six championships with the Celtics, and be elected to 13 NBA All-Star Games among many other honors over that stretch.
Cousy averaged 18.5 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 7.6 assists in his time with Boston.

     Summary: Jayson Tatum netted a game-high 39 points and Jaylen Brown added 23 as the Celtics moved within one win of sweeping the Nets with a 109-103 victory Saturday night at Barclays Center.
Tatum’s output exceeded the combined total for both Durant and Irving, who finished with 16 apiece.
“I’m not trying to make it a one-on-one thing [with Durant] or a matchup thing, just doing whatever I can to get a win,” Tatum said after the game.
But Kevin Durant is Kevin Durant.
“Coming straight into a playoff game, I just got a job to do to help my team win.”

We're talking about a fully healthy Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, and they can't get an inch of space against this Celtics defense.
There are no easy answers against this Boston defense.
This Boston defense has been one of the league's main talking points for a long time now, and yet it's still better than advertised.
Of course, Boston's defense is a different animal than the Brooklyn defense that Tatum and Brown are facing; it's not apples to apples here.

Boston’s defense against the Nets’ firepower was supposed to make this a can’t-miss series, even though it matches a No.
Bruce Brown was the Nets player who could really solve it, scoring a career playoff-high 26 points.
Boston was still ahead by eight with under 1 1/2 minutes left in the half, but the Nets scored seven straight and it was 53-50 at the break.

     Summary: Celtics 5 takeaways as Celtics take a stranglehold on series vs. Nets with Game 3 win "The playoffs are a different animal.
Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics shoots against the Brooklyn Nets during Game Three of the Eastern Conference First Round.
The theory that the Nets might win this series was based on Durant’s ability to slow Jayson Tatum and beat the Celtics’ vaunted defense.
Maybe equally encouraging for the Celtics: Williams didn’t really impact the game, and they still claimed a 3-0 series lead.
Irving raised a lot of eyebrows by noting after the game that the Nets needed more time to play together.

     Summary: Boston, despite being one of the league’s benchmark franchises, has not hosted an All-Star Game since 1964, and that’s been pretty much the city’s choice.
The Celtics are preparing a bid to host a future NBA All-Star Game, likely for 2025 or ‘26.
AdvertisementThe NBA All-Star game hasn't come to Boston since Bill Russell (left) played at home in 1964.
TD Garden has not hosted a major All-Star Game since the Bruins hosted the NHL classic in 1996, when it was the FleetCenter.
Is the MVP the best player in the league or the player who is most valuable to his team?
