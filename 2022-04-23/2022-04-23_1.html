     Summary: The Celtics pushed the Nets to the brink of elimination with a 109-103 win Saturday at Barclays Center.
While the Nets hung around for most of the game, the Celtics pulled away in the fourth quarter.
Kevin Durant looked passive Saturday as he shot 6-for-11 from the field for 16 points despite playing 46 minutes.
Kyrie Irving finished with 16 points and nine assists, looking impressive for stretches, but he shot 6-for-17 from the field.
The Nets appeared to at least be able to push the Celtics in the first two games of the series.

     Summary: Once again, the Celtics’ defense was able to keep Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving — both with 16 points — in check, pulled away with excellent team play late and won Game 3 109-103.
Boston now leads the series 3-0 and the preseason title favorite Nets are one loss away from being bounced in the first round.
Ben Simmons is set to return for the Nets in Game 4 Monday, but that feels like a footnote now.
How good a job has the Celtics defense done on the Nets’ stars?
Nash noted Nets needed Durant to play 40 min a night for several weeks to make playoffs.

Jayson Tatum scored 39 points, Jaylen Brown had 23 and Boston took a 3-0 lead over Brooklyn with a 109-103 victory Saturday night.
Boston's defense against the Nets' firepower was supposed to make this a can't-miss series, even though it matches a No.
Boston was still ahead by eight with under 1½ minutes left in the half, but the Nets scored seven straight and it was 53-50 at the break.

     Summary: Celtics 5 takeaways as Celtics take a stranglehold on series vs. Nets with Game 3 win "The playoffs are a different animal.
Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics shoots against the Brooklyn Nets during Game Three of the Eastern Conference First Round.
The theory that the Nets might win this series was based on Durant’s ability to slow Jayson Tatum and beat the Celtics’ vaunted defense.
Maybe equally encouraging for the Celtics: Williams didn’t really impact the game, and they still claimed a 3-0 series lead.
Irving raised a lot of eyebrows by noting after the game that the Nets needed more time to play together.

     Summary: The Boston Celtics all but ended the Brooklyn Nets' season on Saturday with a 109-103 victory in Game 3 of their first-round series.
We're talking about a fully healthy Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, and they can't get an inch of space against this Celtics defense.
There are no easy answers against this Boston defense.
This Boston defense has been one of the league's main talking points for a long time now, and yet it's still better than advertised.
Of course, Boston's defense is a different animal than the Brooklyn defense that Tatum and Brown are facing; it's not apples to apples here.
