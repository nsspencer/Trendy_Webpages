     Sixers' Joel Embiid dealing with thumb sprain, scores 21 in Game 4 loss vs. Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid has a right thumb injury but played in Saturday’s Game 4 loss against the Toronto Raptors.
He finished with 21 points, eight rebounds and three assists in the 110-102 defeat in Toronto.
After the game, the Sixers star told reporters that he believes he will be able to play throughout his team’s playoff run, despite experiencing pain throughout.
Embiid is expected to have an MRI on his injured thumb on Sunday but will hold off on surgery (if necessary) until the playoffs are over.
— Tim Bontemps (@TimBontemps) April 23, 2022The NBA’s leading scorer played through a sore right thumb during Game 3, and multiple reports say the source of that pain was suspected to be a torn ligament.

     Raptors' Scottie Barnes Unlikely to Return for Game 4 vs. Sixers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: *Update: Scottie Barnes has been upgraded to probable.
The Toronto Raptors could use a reinforcement when they face the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday for Game 4 of the first-round playoff series.
But it was clear Barnes’ injury wasn’t exactly minor considering he was sporting a walking boot ahead of Game 2.
Ahead of Game 3, Nurse expressed the possibility of Barnes returning in Game 4.
While the Raptors were confident in Barnes’ potential return in Game 4, the reality is that he still isn’t cleared for action.

     Sixers Playoff Bell Ringer: Sixers fail to complete sweep in Game 4 loss to Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Playoff Bell Ringer standings:Joel Embiid - 2Tyrese Maxey - 1Put away those brooms, Sixers fans.
The biggest concern for the Sixers is obviously the health of Joel Embiid, who struggled at times during Saturday’s contest.
It wasn’t pretty, but the Sixers are still in the driver’s seat as the series heads back to the Wells Fargo Center.
Nevertheless, there were moments when his midrange game didn’t miss a beat, and he still played 39 minutes.
Hopefully his shooting improves as the Sixers look to avoid a Game 6.

     Sixers at Raptors: Joel Embiid plays through thumb injury, Toronto takes Game 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: pic.twitter.com/8VvQcDrjH1 — Rich Hofmann (@rich_hofmann) April 23, 2022These were Doc Rivers' comments when asked about Joel Embiid's thumb before today's Game 4 in Toronto.
Embiid threw a nice pass from the nail to Shake Milton in the corner, and Milton’s three-pointer made it 16-13 Sixers.
Embiid had a bit more offensive success in the second quarter, although his thumb pain was readily apparent.
They bested the Sixers in points off turnovers (22-3) and fast-break points (21-10) by substantial margins.
Regardless of his availability moving forward, Toronto has shown that it's a resilient team and a Sixers series win isn't cemented quite yet.

     Prop bets ahead of Sixers Game 4 against Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: My best bet this round for the Sixers was grabbing a player performance double before Game 1 that had Tyrese Maxey topping 30-plus points and the Sixers to win at +2500 ($10 to win $250).
After a great 26-point performance on Game 1, Harris has notched double-doubles in the Sixers' last two games.
Maxey stole the show to open up the Sixers' series with Toronto, dropping 38 points in Game 1.
He followed that up with a 23-point effort in Game 2 before "only" tallying 19 points in Game 3.
There's a revenge game element here given that Green was on the 2019 Raptors team that won the championship.
