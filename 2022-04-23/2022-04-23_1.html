     Boston Celtics Hall of Fame forward Larry Bird's best highlights: Volume VI
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While we have not seen as much of the legendary Boston Celtics counterpart to Los Angeles Lakers icon Earvin “Magic” Johnson in the hit HBO NBA basketball series “Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,” but Hall of Fame small forward Larry Joe Bird played an important foil to the Los Angeles title teams of the 1980s.
Better known as the ‘Showtime” Lakers, the team joined the Celtics, through the on-court wizardry of Magic and Bird, to help revitalize a moribund NBA in the early 1980s.
With many younger Boston fans becoming aware of that era of play and the Celtics’ own titles teams of that decade, it behooves us to share more highlights of Larry Legend and his play with the Boston teams from that era.
And since December of 2021, NBC Boston Sports has been putting out the best of Bird’s highlights, now up to its sixth edition.

     On this day: Bob Cousy's last game as a Celtic; Frank Ramsey drafted
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On this day in Boston Celtics history, Celtics point guard luminary Bob Cousy finished his career with the Celtics with a bang in 1963, defeating the longtime Boston rival Los Angeles Lakers 112 – 109 in Game 6 of the NBA Finals four that year, securing Boston’s fifth consecutive NBA championship.
Cousy scored 18 points, 3 rebounds, and 7 assists in his final game as a Celtic, shooting 8-of-16 from the floor.
The Holy Cross product played for 13 seasons with Boston, virtually his entire career apart from seven games as player-coach for the Cincinnati Royals in the 1969-70 season.
He would win six championships with the Celtics, and be elected to 13 NBA All-Star Games among many other honors over that stretch.
Cousy averaged 18.5 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 7.6 assists in his time with Boston.

     How Celtics’ past failures have translated to NBA Playoffs wins in clutch games: ‘Winning plays matter’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s why Boston coach Ime Udoka, after close losses to the Mavericks and Heat, thought the Celtics needed those valuable close-game reps.
That reality has been the case for the Celtics in their opening three games — and they’ve delivered every single time.
Game 3, the latest data point, was another close win where the Celtics fended off the Nets whenever they got too close.
“Those help you win games down the line,” Brown said.
That approach has the Celtics up 3-0 on the Nets with Game 4 set to tipoff at 7 p.m. Monday at Barclays Center.

We're talking about a fully healthy Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, and they can't get an inch of space against this Celtics defense.
There are no easy answers against this Boston defense.
This Boston defense has been one of the league's main talking points for a long time now, and yet it's still better than advertised.
Of course, Boston's defense is a different animal than the Brooklyn defense that Tatum and Brown are facing; it's not apples to apples here.

Boston’s defense against the Nets’ firepower was supposed to make this a can’t-miss series, even though it matches a No.
Bruce Brown was the Nets player who could really solve it, scoring a career playoff-high 26 points.
Boston was still ahead by eight with under 1 1/2 minutes left in the half, but the Nets scored seven straight and it was 53-50 at the break.

Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics shoots against the Brooklyn Nets during Game Three of the Eastern Conference First Round.
The theory that the Nets might win this series was based on Durant’s ability to slow Jayson Tatum and beat the Celtics’ vaunted defense.
Maybe equally encouraging for the Celtics: Williams didn’t really impact the game, and they still claimed a 3-0 series lead.
Irving raised a lot of eyebrows by noting after the game that the Nets needed more time to play together.

     Summary: Boston, despite being one of the league’s benchmark franchises, has not hosted an All-Star Game since 1964, and that’s been pretty much the city’s choice.
The Celtics are preparing a bid to host a future NBA All-Star Game, likely for 2025 or ‘26.
AdvertisementThe NBA All-Star game hasn't come to Boston since Bill Russell (left) played at home in 1964.
TD Garden has not hosted a major All-Star Game since the Bruins hosted the NHL classic in 1996, when it was the FleetCenter.
Is the MVP the best player in the league or the player who is most valuable to his team?
