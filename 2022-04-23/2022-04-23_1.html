     What Robert Williams' potential Game 3 return means for Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Celtics, already gushing with confidence after holding serve in the first two games of an Eastern Conference first-round series against the Brooklyn Nets, are poised to get another jolt with the impending return of Robert Williams.
The Celtics upgraded Williams to questionable for Saturday’s Game 3 in Brooklyn and, barring a setback, there is hope within the organization that Williams can play a limited role in a return to the court.
The Celtics will tread cautiously with reintegrating Williams, but there is no fear that an expedited return might aggravate his knee ailment.
There will be obvious rust from a months-long absence, but Williams’ return feels a bit like the final infinity stone for a Celtics starting five that has been a steamroller during the 2021-22 regular season.
There’s something to be said for the way the Celtics and Nets have navigated the return-from-injury process for Williams and Ben Simmons.

     Boston Celtics at Brooklyn Nets Round 1 Game 3 4/23/22
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum and the Celtics defense have harassed him at every turn and made everything very difficult for him.
However, the Celtics defense has not been as good as it could be.
The Celtics out-rebounded the Nets 43-29 in Game 1 but in Game 2, both teams had 36 rebounds.
In the first half where the Celtics were behind by as many as 17 points, the Nets out-rebounded the Celtics.
The Celtics defense has been ferocious against the Nets’ two superstars and it can only get better with the free safety addition of Time Lord.
