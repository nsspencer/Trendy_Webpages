     Boston Celtics beat Brooklyn Nets 109-103 in Game 3, one win away from sweeping first-round series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Celtics pushed the Nets to the brink of elimination with a 109-103 win Saturday at Barclays Center.
While the Nets hung around for most of the game, the Celtics pulled away in the fourth quarter.
Kevin Durant looked passive Saturday as he shot 6-for-11 from the field for 16 points despite playing 46 minutes.
Kyrie Irving finished with 16 points and nine assists, looking impressive for stretches, but he shot 6-for-17 from the field.
The Nets appeared to at least be able to push the Celtics in the first two games of the series.

     Summary: Just 24 days after having surgery on a torn meniscus, Robert Williams III was back in the lineup for the Boston Celtics.
Playing on a minutes restriction, Time Lord logged 16 minutes for the Celtics in a 109-103 win that gave Boston a commanding 3-0 lead over the Brooklyn Nets in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals.
As such, there weren't a ton of highlights from Williams in the game.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If ever there was a night for the Brooklyn Nets to come out with urgency, it was Saturday.
Trailing the Boston Celtics 2-0 in their first-round series, Kevin Durant and Co. should have been desperate.
The Celtics built a 12-point lead early in the second quarter and held on for the comfortable victory at Barclays Center, seizing a 3-0 series lead and setting up a possible sweep in Game 4 on Monday.
The Celtics rolled into the playoffs as the East’s second seed, and their core group has moved in sync thanks to its past postseason trips.
“I’m just thinking too much, to be honest,” said Durant, who credited Boston’s size for making life difficult on Brooklyn.
