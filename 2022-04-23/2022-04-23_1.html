     Summary: The Chicago Bulls logo seems to be a favorite for more than just fans.
A new ranking from Online Betting named the Bulls' logo as the top among all NBA teams, as well as the "most intimidating" and "most timeless."
"When it comes to the best NBA team logos, the Chicago Bulls top the list.
"It may be no surprise, the Chicago Bulls take the title for the most timeliness logo," Online Betting wrote.
"The current Bulls logo hasn’t changed since 1966, and since it tops the best logo list, there seems to be no reason to make changes anytime soon."

     Chicago Bulls emphasize pace after a lopsided Game 3 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks: ‘We moved way, way too slow’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bulls need to push the pace.
They’re rarely the biggest or strongest team on the court — especially in their first-round playoff series against the Milwaukee Bucks.
At times we moved way, way too slow.”AdvertisementExpand Autoplay Image 1 of 24 Chicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine (8) heads to the locker after a 111-81 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks at United Center on April 22, 2022, in Chicago.
The Bulls scored only five points in transition in Game 3, continuing a trend from Game 2 (six fast-break points) and Game 1 (five points).
But to grind out a series against the Bucks, the Bulls can’t allow a double-digit lead to crush their pace of play.

     The Chicago Bulls were outplayed by one bitter enemy in particular
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What didn’t help was the fact that maybe the most hated Bucks player was having himself a night.
Grayson Allen single-handedly ripped the heart out of Chicago Bulls fans and took life out of the United Center.
Of course, Allen’s infamous foul on Alex Caruso earlier in the season made him easy for Bulls fans to hate.
Throughout the rest of the game, Allen was aggressive going to the bucket on occasion and made some rather impressive finishes.
Not a single Bulls player outscored Allen, nor did they come close to his +15 in the plus/minus category.

     Summary: After such a promising Game 2 performance where they snatched a big win on the road, the Chicago Bulls came out flat in Game 3 on Friday and were absolutely pummeled by the Milwaukee Bucks, losing 111-81 on home court.
That being said, here are 3 adjustments the Bulls must make in Game 4.
3 adjustments Bulls must make after Game 3 loss to BucksDeRozan and LaVine need to be consistentThe star duo of DeRozan and Zach LaVine was downright poor in Game 1, combining to shoot well under 35% overall.
Yes, they’re still stout defensively, but the Bulls need to be a lot more aggressive and find looks.
Again, the Bulls need to come out with serious aggression in Game 4 and attack the cup.

     Summary: After a tremendous effort which resulted in a road win in Game Two, the Chicago Bulls had a chance to take a 2-1 series on their home court.
Entire Offense Thrown Out of SyncThe Bulls only scored 81 points in Game Three and failed to score more than twenty points in three of the four quarters.
Bulls having such a hard time attacking the paint because of how well the Bucks guards are pressing Zach and DeMar.
If not, things could get ugly in a hurry if the Bucks hit a groove offensively.
Portis and Allen were the only two Bucks to hit more than two shots from downtown but that was more than enough.

     Summary: It was the bulk of what resulted in a 17-9 lead for the Bucks, forcing the Bulls to take their first timeout of the game.
That early onslaught from the role players ended up being a taste of what was to come for the rest of the night as Milwaukee rolled Chicago to a 111-81 win.
The reason for that "quiet" night from the two-time league MVP was because of the production the Bucks were getting from everyone else.
It was the exact type of effort Milwaukee needed as it faced a raucous United Center crowd without its second-best player available.
During that span, Allen started in each game and averaged 18.3 points while shooting 50.7 percent from deep on over eight attempts a game.

Or as we outsiders call it, “ ’Waukee talkie.”What do you say whenever you’re anyplace but Wisconsin and meet somebody from Milwaukee?
But if the Bulls win?
The Bucks and Bulls have all too rarely even been average or better at the same time.
How many times did Michael Jordan’s Bulls beat the Bucks en route to a title in the 1990s, for example?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bulls wanted to make sure they got the attention of the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks.
That's right, the Bulls had a 3-2 lead... and it was pretty much all Bucks from there and back to Bucks home court advantage.
Though in the second quarter, Bulls lead scorer Nikola Vucevic with 19 points set a heck of a screen on...
They had just 10 turnovers for seven Bulls points and held the Bulls, forced to shoot mostly jump shots and not particularly well, to 30 interior points.
Even the shots the Bulls made were difficult, and the Bucks with the rebounding edge kept the Bulls from much transition play.
