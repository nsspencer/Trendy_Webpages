     NBA Playoffs – Bucks vs Bulls: Game 3 Recap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grayson came off the bench and hit back to back to back threes and had 14 points in the first half.
Giannis Antetokounmpo made up for a slower than usual start with a 13-0 run in the second quarter.
By the half, the defending champions had themselves a big lead, up 19 points and looked in full control.
All GasIt’s no secret that the Bucks aren’t the greatest third quarter team, in fact they love a third period collapse.
Fans would be well within their rights to have been uneasy at a 19 point lead.

     Summary: The end result was the biggest home loss of the Bulls in their playoffs history.
Some of those spots that Khris is usually in on offense — top of the key, playing off of post-ups, isolations.
I was there and got the ball swung, and they collapsed hard on Giannis and Jrue (Holiday) all game long.
Holiday added 16 points to help the Bucks beat the Bulls for the 18th time in 20 gamesMontenegrin center Nikola Vucevic led Chicago with 19 points.
Zach LaVine had 15 and DeMar DeRozan finished with just 11 with the Bucks crowding him after setting a career playoff-high with 41 in Game 2.

     Milwaukee vs. Chicago Game Three: Winning Cures All
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No Khris Middleton, no problem for Friday night’s Milwaukee Bucks, as they absolutely dismantled the Chicago Bulls on the defensive end of the court, while showing improved offensive flow en route to a decisive 111-81 win.
In a twist of fate, the third quarter was friendly to the Bucks, holding Chicago to just 18 points as they built up a 90-59 lead.
This was the type of Bucks defense we expected to see all series, holding them to an 84.6 offensive rating.
Offensively though, Allen found some groove early on with three made triples and stripping Caruso while driving to the rim.
— Eric Nehm (@eric_nehm) April 23, 2022Another offensive foul on Giannis Antetokounmpo - his second this game.

     Bulls routed by Bucks in Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bulls wanted to make sure they got the attention of the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks.
That's right, the Bulls had a 3-2 lead... and it was pretty much all Bucks from there and back to Bucks home court advantage.
Though in the second quarter, Bulls lead scorer Nikola Vucevic with 19 points set a heck of a screen on...
They had just 10 turnovers for seven Bulls points and held the Bulls, forced to shoot mostly jump shots and not particularly well, to 30 interior points.
Even the shots the Bulls made were difficult, and the Bucks with the rebounding edge kept the Bulls from much transition play.
