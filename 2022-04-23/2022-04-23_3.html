     Sixers' Joel Embiid dealing with thumb sprain, scores 21 in Game 4 loss vs. Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid has a right thumb injury but played in Saturday’s Game 4 loss against the Toronto Raptors.
He finished with 21 points, eight rebounds and three assists in the 110-102 defeat in Toronto.
After the game, the Sixers star told reporters that he believes he will be able to play throughout his team’s playoff run, despite experiencing pain throughout.
Embiid is expected to have an MRI on his injured thumb on Sunday but will hold off on surgery (if necessary) until the playoffs are over.
— Tim Bontemps (@TimBontemps) April 23, 2022The NBA’s leading scorer played through a sore right thumb during Game 3, and multiple reports say the source of that pain was suspected to be a torn ligament.

     Danny Green Discusses Key Reason Sixers Could Use Sweep vs. Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unfortunately, the Sixers came up short during their Game 4 matchup and couldn't complete the series until they won at home for Game 5.
As Philadelphia has gained a significant 3-0 lead over the fifth-seeded Toronto Raptors, they could put the series away for good with a win on Saturday afternoon.
Danny Green Stresses Importance of a SweepFollowing a Friday afternoon shootaround in Toronto, Sixers veteran forward Danny Green addressed reporters to discuss the possibility of the Sixers sweeping their Atlantic Division rivals in the first round.
According to Sixers Wire's Ky Carlin, Green highlights rest and recovery as a reason why the Sixers could use the additional time off.
Therefore, Embiid, Green, and the Sixers will look to do all they can to put the Raptors away once and for all on Saturday.

     Sixers at Raptors: Joel Embiid plays through thumb injury, Toronto takes Game 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Embiid threw a nice pass from the nail to Shake Milton in the corner, and Milton’s three-pointer made it 16-13 Sixers.
Embiid had a bit more offensive success in the second quarter, although his thumb pain was readily apparent.
The Sixers again used an eight-man rotation but cut Green's minutes to 28 after he played 46 in Game 3.
They bested the Sixers in points off turnovers (22-3) and fast-break points (21-10) by substantial margins.
Regardless of his availability moving forward, Toronto has shown that it's a resilient team and a Sixers series win isn't cemented quite yet.

     Summary: Playoff Bell Ringer standings:Joel Embiid - 2Tyrese Maxey - 1Put away those brooms, Sixers fans.
The biggest concern for the Sixers is obviously the health of Joel Embiid, who struggled at times during Saturday’s contest.
It wasn’t pretty, but the Sixers are still in the driver’s seat as the series heads back to the Wells Fargo Center.
Nevertheless, there were moments when his midrange game didn’t miss a beat, and he still played 39 minutes.
Hopefully his shooting improves as the Sixers look to avoid a Game 6.
