     McTominay accuses Manchester United of lacking ‘fundamentals of football’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scott McTominay has laid bare the crisis that has overtaken Manchester United, saying there are a “whole load of problems in terms of players, staff, everything higher up”.
The midfielder was hugely frustrated after the 3-1 defeat at Arsenal – when United had the chances to have taken something – and accused the team of lacking the “fundamentals of football” including “balls” and belief.
When we get back in the dressing room – it’s go home and take a look at yourself in the mirror.
We had a half-decent game but even then it is the belief, which is so big in football.
Rangnick accepted United had to defend better and press more often.

     How Arsenal overcame Manchester United at The Emirates: Analysis and recap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal took another huge step towards Champions League qualification with a crucial 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Emirates Stadium.
United almost responded immediately after Ronaldo slipped a through ball into the path of Anthony Elanga, who failed to convert his one-on-one effort.
Bruno Fernandes missed a good chance for United before Elanga saw a penalty appeal turned down, as the tide began to swing.
Ten minutes into the second period United were awarded a penalty after Tavares handled the ball in the area, but Fernandes’ weak penalty struck the post.
United continued to look threatening and just after the hour mark Ronaldo had a goal chalked off.
