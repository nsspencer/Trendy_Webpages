     Raptors' Scottie Barnes Unlikely to Return for Game 4 vs. Sixers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: *Update: Scottie Barnes has been upgraded to probable.
The Toronto Raptors could use a reinforcement when they face the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday for Game 4 of the first-round playoff series.
But it was clear Barnes’ injury wasn’t exactly minor considering he was sporting a walking boot ahead of Game 2.
Ahead of Game 3, Nurse expressed the possibility of Barnes returning in Game 4.
While the Raptors were confident in Barnes’ potential return in Game 4, the reality is that he still isn’t cleared for action.

     Sixers news: Danny Green reveals why Game 4 is a must-win vs Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Game 4 is a must-win for the Raptors to keep their playoff hopes alive, while the Sixers have a lot of leeway ahead of the Saturday afternoon matchup.
However, according to Danny Green, a Game 4 win would be extremely beneficial to the Philadelphia team.
He spoke about Joel Embiid’s unfortunate injury and even mentioned a few other ailments within the Sixers roster in his explanation.
“It’s very important [to win Saturday] so we can get rest,” Danny Green said ahead of Game 4, quotes courtesy of Keith Pompey.
It’s the hardest game of the series.”The Sixers have been pretty vocal about Embiid’s injury, which is likely a torn ligament on his right thumb.

     Prop bets ahead of Sixers Game 4 against Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: My best bet this round for the Sixers was grabbing a player performance double before Game 1 that had Tyrese Maxey topping 30-plus points and the Sixers to win at +2500 ($10 to win $250).
After a great 26-point performance on Game 1, Harris has notched double-doubles in the Sixers' last two games.
Maxey stole the show to open up the Sixers' series with Toronto, dropping 38 points in Game 1.
He followed that up with a 23-point effort in Game 2 before "only" tallying 19 points in Game 3.
There's a revenge game element here given that Green was on the 2019 Raptors team that won the championship.

     Sixers Vs. Raptors Game 4: Storylines to Watch as Sixers Go for Sweep
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rookie Charles Barkley scored 14 points off the bench in the Sixers’ Game 4 win over the Bucks at the Spectrum in the 1985 Eastern Conference semifinals.
On Saturday afternoon in Toronto, the Sixers have an opportunity to finish off the Raptors in four games and advance to the second round.
Paul Reed has given the Sixers 10 minutes per game this series, but he’s a 22-year-old without much NBA experience.
The Raptors will be determined to replicate the chaos and forced turnovers that caused the Sixers’ early deficit Wednesday.
While the Sixers eventually calmed the game down, in part through employing zone defense, they’ve seen that Toronto can be genuinely dangerous.

     Sixers' Joel Embiid dealing with thumb sprain, starts Game 4 vs. Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid has a right thumb injury but started Game 4 against the Toronto Raptors on Saturday (LIVE, TNT).
The NBA’s leading scorer played through a sore right thumb during Game 3, and multiple reports say the source of that pain was suspected to be a torn ligament.
Sixers coach Doc Rivers said there was “concern” when speaking to reporters on Saturday but did not confirm if there was a ligament tear in Embiid’s thumb.
Embiid, who is averaging 27.7 points and 13 rebounds in the series, wore a brace on his right hand and thumb during Friday’s practice.
He told reporters the pain would not keep him out of Game 4.
