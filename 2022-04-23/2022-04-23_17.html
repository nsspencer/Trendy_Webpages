     French election 2022: Macron faces far-right rival Le Pen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sunday's runoff is a rematch of the 2017 presidential election, in which Macron beat Le Pen by a landslide.
Recent opinion polls reported by French media show a close race, with Macron leading Le Pen by 13 percentage points.
Le Pen, 53, has sought to soften her rhetoric and image as the leader of the far-right French political party National Rally.
For some, the former banker-turned-president is the lesser of two evils and a vote for Macron is considered a vote against Le Pen.
Still, no one is ruling out the possibility of a triumph for Le Pen.

     French election 2022: Voting under way in presidential runoff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: French voters are casting their ballot in the presidential runoff to choose between centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron and far-right politician Marine Le Pen.
Marine Le Pen’s dogged focus on inflation and the cost of living have seen her perform better than in 2017.
Unlike previous elections where immigration, religion-versus-secularism and identity were front and centre, this election has been fought on two principle issues, purchasing power and security.
The race tightened during the first round of election, but he appears to have pulled away since then.
To take account of the time difference with mainland France, polls opened earlier in overseas territories, home to almost three million French.

     Live Updates: Voting Underway as France Chooses Between Macron and Le Pen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Le Pen and Mr. Macron will come to a head as the French choose their president for a five-year term.
Le Pen; he did not, however, endorse Mr. Macron, who moved right during his presidency and whose aloof assurance is often perceived as arrogance.
It has split into three blocs: the hard-line left, an amorphous center gathered around Mr. Macron and the extreme right of Marine Le Pen.
Le Pen is no longer an outlier.
If Mr. Macron does edge to victory, as polls suggest, he will face a restive, divided country, where hatred of him is not uncommon.

     Not just exit polls: Why French election projections are almost always correct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Projections and preliminary results won’t be known until after the last polling stations close at 8pm.
On election day, polling stations in mainland France close at 7pm in most places and at 8pm in the larger cities including Paris.
Unlike in most other democracies, where those projections are based on exit polls, French pollsters base their estimates on ballots that have actually been counted.
“We also use exit polls in France, for instance to evaluate each candidate’s level of support by age group or profession,” he says.
In polling stations sampled by Ipsos and its peers, an official calls the pollster after every 100 ballots counted to report the results.

     Summary: In the first-round vote on April 10, Macron received 28 percent of the vote share, and Le Pen 23 percent.
French President Emmanuel Macron is trying to fend off a victory from far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in the presidential election on April 24.
AdvertisementMost of the candidates who failed to qualify for the second round beseeched their supporters not to vote for Le Pen.
Le Pen renamed the party from National Front to National Rally in 2018.
Macron is hoping that for all the voters who dislike him, more people strongly oppose Le Pen.

     Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen face off again, with France's future direction at stake
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Le Pen, 53, has put forward an economically nationalist, more inward-looking platform that would represent a fundamental shift from the direction France has taken since the end of World War II.
Macron bested Le Pen in that vote by nearly two to one.
Macron's attempts at diplomacy took him away from the campaign trail, while Le Pen was forced to backtrack on her previous support for Vladimir Putin.
However, critics say Le Pen's campaign has not adequately explained how Paris will pay for many of the solutions being proposed.
