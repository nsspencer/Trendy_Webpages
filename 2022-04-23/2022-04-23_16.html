     Summary: People queue to vote in the second round of the 2022 French presidential election at a polling station in Lyon, France, April 24, 2022.
REUTERS/Stephane MahePARIS, April 24 (Reuters) - Voter turnout in the second round of the French presidential election on Sunday was 26.41% by midday (1000 GMT), interior ministry data showed.
The turnout figure was lower than at the same time in 2017, when it stood at 28.23%, but higher than the first round of 2022 two weeks ago, when it came in at 25.48% by noon.
Analysts say a low turnout adds to uncertainty surrounding the final result.

     French election 2022: Voting under way in presidential runoff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: French voters are casting their ballot in the presidential runoff to choose between centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron and far-right politician Marine Le Pen.
Marine Le Pen’s dogged focus on inflation and the cost of living have seen her perform better than in 2017.
Unlike previous elections where immigration, religion-versus-secularism and identity were front and centre, this election has been fought on two principle issues, purchasing power and security.
The race tightened during the first round of election, but he appears to have pulled away since then.
To take account of the time difference with mainland France, polls opened earlier in overseas territories, home to almost three million French.

Le Pen; he did not, however, endorse Mr. Macron, who moved right during his presidency and whose aloof assurance is often perceived as arrogance.
It has split into three blocs: the hard-line left, an amorphous center gathered around Mr. Macron and the extreme right of Marine Le Pen.
Le Pen is no longer an outlier.
If Mr. Macron does edge to victory, as polls suggest, he will face a restive, divided country, where hatred of him is not uncommon.

     French presidential election 2022: Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen face off again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris CNN —French voters will choose between two very different visions for their country during Sunday’s presidential runoff election, as the centrist President Emmanuel Macron seeks to fend off a challenge from his far-right opponent, Marine Le Pen.
Le Pen, 53, has put forward an economically nationalist, more inward-looking platform that would represent a fundamental shift from the direction France has taken since the end of World War II.
Macron bested Le Pen in that vote by nearly two to one.
However, critics say Le Pen’s campaign has not adequately explained how Paris will pay for many of the solutions being proposed.

     Not just exit polls: Why French election projections are almost always correct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Projections and preliminary results won’t be known until after the last polling stations close at 8pm.
On election day, polling stations in mainland France close at 7pm in most places and at 8pm in the larger cities including Paris.
Unlike in most other democracies, where those projections are based on exit polls, French pollsters base their estimates on ballots that have actually been counted.
“We also use exit polls in France, for instance to evaluate each candidate’s level of support by age group or profession,” he says.
In polling stations sampled by Ipsos and its peers, an official calls the pollster after every 100 ballots counted to report the results.
