     Gabriel Jesus Scores Four Goals As Man City Thrash Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If this is to be his final season at the Etihad Stadium then Gabriel Jesus delivered Manchester City a very welcome goodbye gift.
But Jesus was in Guardiola's starting XI for Saturday's Premier League game against Watford.
And he delivered four goals and an assist inside the first 53 minutes as City maintained their status as Premier League title favorites with a 5-1 win.
Jesus had only scored three Premier League goals all season before prime relegation candidates Watford came to Manchester.
Jesus has already won seven major trophies with City, who are in contention to claim this season's Champions League as well as the Premier League.

     Gabriel Jesus scores four as Man City rout Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gabriel Jesus has often flattered to deceive during his five-and-a-bit years at Manchester City.
That this was his first Premier League hat-trick in that time, despite playing in such a free-scoring team, is perhaps evidence that he has not quite delivered on his early promise.
Having allowed Watford back into the game once, City were not about to let it happen again and won a penalty just 14 seconds into the second half.
And still, a first league hat-trick secured, he was not finished there.
Five minutes later, Jesus finished off a flowing City counterattack by tucking De Bruyne’s pass inside the near post.
