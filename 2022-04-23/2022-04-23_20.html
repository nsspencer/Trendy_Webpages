    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Weather obviously plays an important role in Thunder Over Louisville and thankfully, Saturday’s forecast is sunny and warm.
But WAVE 3 Meteorologist Tawana Andrew said of the 30 full Thunder shows since 1990, rain has fallen on half of them.
Andrew said rain doesn’t really affect the aircraft but clouds sure can.
Andrew said if the wind is too strong it limits which runway aircraft can use.

     Thunder Over Louisville returns to the waterfront for the first time since 2019 – 89.3 WFPL News Louisville
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thunder Over Louisville returned to Waterfront Park on Saturday, after COVID-19 forced the Kentucky Derby Festival kick-off event to be canceled in 2020 and scaled back with pop-up sites last year.
“With us being closed in for the last two years, it feels good to be in sunshine and open-air,” Tyhittian Waters said.
Waters set up outside of Slugger Field around 9 a.m., though some family members were there even earlier.
Lynn Perti and her husband, Robert, usually watch the fireworks from Jeffersonville’s waterfront, but they crossed the river this year to celebrate Thunder’s return.
Petri said they arrived at 7 a.m. to find a parking spot near Slugger Field, where they planned to watch the fireworks after a baseball game.

     Summary: While crowds have been itching to get back to an in-person Thunder, like with any large outdoor event, remember to take extra caution to protect your health.
While many have been itching to get back to an in-person Thunder, like with any large outdoor event, it's important to remember to take extra precaution to protect your health.
Dr. Lauren Pollock, an audiologist at University of Louisville Health, said that the noise level at Thunder can cause immediate damage to your ears if you're close enough to the sound.
Here's how to protect your hearing:Foam ear plugs.
But with this year's Thunder possibly being one of the warmest on record, noise isn't the only health problem to watch out for.
