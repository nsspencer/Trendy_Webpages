     Elon Musk confirms he turned down Bill Gates on climate change collaboration over shorting Tesla
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk confirmed Friday that he rejected working with Bill Gates on climate change via text because the Microsoft co-founder was shorting Tesla.
In the texts, the two billionaires appear set to meet somewhere before Musk asks Gates if he still has a "half billion dollar short position against Tesla."
Musk replies that he can’t take Gates’ philanthropy on climate change "seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve climate change."
Musk also trolled Gates with a vulgar tweet Friday comparing a photo of the Seattleite to a pregnant man emoji.

     Rich man Elon Musk confronted rich man Bill Gates about shorting Tesla stock
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Finally, an Elon Musk Twitter story that doesn’t involve him potentially owning the website.
It all started earlier that evening, when an account called Whole Mars Catalog posted several screenshots allegedly showing a text exchange between Musk and Gates.
In the conversation, Musk asks Gates if he has a $500 million short stock position against Tesla.
Gates confirms he does, brings up the possibility of the two doing philanthropic work together, and is promptly shut down by Musk for, uh, hoping Tesla fails.
The original post made it clear that the veracity of the texts hadn’t been confirmed, but Musk did the thing Musk does and hopped in himself.

     Musk Tries to Sting Gates WIth Crude ‘Pregnant Man’ Tweet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you thought Elon Musk had better things to do than insult Bill Gates on the social-media platform he is maybe trying to buy, you would be wrong.
The world’s richest man, seemingly tweaked that his fellow billionaire has shorted Tesla stock, mocked him on Twitter with a crude post that compared the Microsoft founder’s potbelly to a pregnant man emoji.
Musk captioned the puerile tweet: “in case u need to lose a boner fast.”The gibe came hours after Musk confirmed on Twitter the authenticity of screenshots that appeared to show him confronting Gates about his half-billion-dollar bet that Tesla stock would sink.
The purported text exchange was posted by Musk superfan Omar Qazi—who is also his co-defendant in a lawsuit filed by short-seller Aaron Greenspan—on Friday.
Qazi asked Musk via tweet if the texts were “real.”The electric-vehicle kingpin said they were but that he did not leak them.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk seemed to poke fun at Bill Gates by posting a tweet with an emoji of a pregnant man.
The tweets follow leaked texts in which Musk turned down a philanthropic opportunity.
Musk posted it after screenshots of texts between the two billionaires were leaked by Twitter account @WholeMarsBlog, which Musk later confirmed were real.
The leaked texts show Musk asking Gates: "Do you still have a half billion dollar short position against Tesla?"
Tesla and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did not respond to Insider's requests for comment made outside of normal working hours.

     Summary: Tesla (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc Report CEO Elon Musk needs a meeting with his human resources department.
Now, Musk has engaged in a very high-profile fight with Microsoft (MSFT) - Get Microsoft Corporation Report Founder Bill Gates.
The conversation then took a major turn for the negative when Musk inquired about Gates holding a $500 million short position against Tesla.
To paraphrase Michelle Obama, Musk went low and Gates went high.
He did acknowledge holding that Tesla short position in his text exchange with Musk.

     Elon Musk Makes Crude Bill Gates Joke, Angry Over Tesla Shorts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk has ruffled feathers by comparing Bill Gates to an emoji addressing transgender people -- and it all seems to stem from a back-and-forth they had that left Elon pissed.
Of course, some were confused about the shot in the first place ... but leaked texts between Elon and Bill seem to paint a clearer picture about what's going on.
So apparently Bill Gates hit up @elonmusk to discuss “philanthropy on climate change” but Elon asked if he still had a half billion dollar short position on $TSLA.
Before that, though, Elon asked him straight up ... you shorting my company, bro?
Elon also argues that Tesla is doing a lot to mitigate climate change by investing in sustainable energy, so he sees Bill's position as hypocritical here.
