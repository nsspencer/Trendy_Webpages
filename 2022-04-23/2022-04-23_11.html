     Summary: Jason Bateman is an award-winning American actor who has quite the acting experience as he has been in the entertainment industry since the 1980s.
Bateman began his acting career in 1980 as James Cooper on the NBC show “Little House on the Prairie” and has been featured in several other noteworthy productions.
Further discussions progressed onto the “Ozark” and how fans would react to the last chapter of the season finale.
Tambor previously admitted to allegations about him insulting Walter and Bateman defended the former “Transparent” star by describing the disapproving action as expected in the entertainment industry.
It sounds like I’m insensitive to Jessica.
