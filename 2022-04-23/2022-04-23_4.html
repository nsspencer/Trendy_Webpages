     Record Store Day: Why it's great, and why it isn't
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "We had the bands booked and posters printed for the Record Store Day event in 2020, and we were all ready.
There ended up being four scattered Record Store Day drops in 2020 and then three in 2021.
But, also, they've created that customer by telling him, 'Come to Record Store Day once a year and buy these deluxe recordings of the stuff that you liked 20 or 30 years ago.'
Not all record stores take part in Record Store Day because of the cost of the RSD releases and the risks involved.
"When you're managing a successful record store," Cozby says, "one of the most important things you do is wisely manage your relationship to Record Store Day, because if you go into a failing record store, one that's close to going out of business, you will most definitely find a ton of leftover Record Store Day stock that that they didn't sell.
