     Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey Images Reveal First Look at Horror Reimagining
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pooh is leaving the lands of Hundred Acre Wood for the realm of indie horror flicks.
That's right, horror fiends have discovered the existence of Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, an upcoming picture featuring the golden bear in his very own scary movie.
An independent feature from Rhys Frake-Waterfield, the film released a batch of images Wednesday showing off its morbid content, reminiscent of the blood-filled slashers of yesteryear.
Something like Blood and Honey doesn't need Disney's approval as they no longer have the exclusive rights to AA Milne's works.
Now that anyone can make their own Pooh story, Frake-Waterfield is bushing the boundaries as far they can bend right off the bat.

     Horror Movie ‘Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey’ Turns the Beloved Character into a Slasher Maniac!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Strange things can start to happen when beloved characters slip into the public domain, and upcoming horror movie Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey sure is a testament to that.
The upcoming horror movie – which is of course not related to Disney in any way, shape or form – turns the anthropomorphic yellow teddy bear into a monstrous murderer.
Rhys Frake-Waterfield directed Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, Dread Central discovered this week, and several first-look images suggest a dark and twisted vision.
No plot details are available at this time, but it looks like the movie centers on a killer wearing a Winnie the Pooh mask.
Amber Doig-Thorne, Maria Taylor, and Danielle Scott star in the horror movie.

     'Blood and Honey' Puts a Gruesome Spin on Winnie the Pooh's Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A. Milne’s Winnie the Pooh is about to take a grisly turn in an upcoming horror film entitled Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey.
It is unconfirmed whether the other characters from Hundred Acre Wood — Christopher Robin, Eeyore, Kanga and Roo — will be making appearances.
This version of Winnie the Pooh is not to be confused with Disney’s licensed character, who is known for wearing a red shirt.
Stay tuned for an official trailer and release date.
Elsewhere in entertainment, a live-action Speed Racer adaptation is in the works.

     Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey Images Turn the Cuddly Bear Into a Violent Killer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are many published works that enter the public domain every year, and this year saw the addition of iconic children’s bear Winnie the Pooh.
MOVIEWEB VIDEO OF THE DAYThe original stories of Winnie the Pooh were published in 1926, and due to copyright laws that relate to publications from before 1976, the 95-year protection of the original characters and setting has now lapsed.
Definitely not one for the kiddies, this version of Pooh wears braces, swings a mallet and lurks in cars seemingly stalking potential victims.
Soon after Pooh entered the public domain, actor Ryan Reynolds used the character to advertise his Mint Mobile brand.
Whether Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey turns out to be one of those, or surpasses all expectations to be a genius move is something that we can only wait and see.
