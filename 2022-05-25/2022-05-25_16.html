     Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey Images Reveal First Look at Horror Reimagining
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pooh is leaving the lands of Hundred Acre Wood for the realm of indie horror flicks.
That's right, horror fiends have discovered the existence of Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, an upcoming picture featuring the golden bear in his very own scary movie.
An independent feature from Rhys Frake-Waterfield, the film released a batch of images Wednesday showing off its morbid content, reminiscent of the blood-filled slashers of yesteryear.
Something like Blood and Honey doesn't need Disney's approval as they no longer have the exclusive rights to AA Milne's works.
Now that anyone can make their own Pooh story, Frake-Waterfield is bushing the boundaries as far they can bend right off the bat.

     Horror Movie ‚ÄòWinnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey‚Äô Turns the Beloved Character into a Slasher Maniac!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Strange things can start to happen when beloved characters slip into the public domain, and upcoming horror movie Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey sure is a testament to that.
The upcoming horror movie ‚Äì which is of course not related to Disney in any way, shape or form ‚Äì turns the anthropomorphic yellow teddy bear into a monstrous murderer.
Rhys Frake-Waterfield directed Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, Dread Central discovered this week, and several first-look images suggest a dark and twisted vision.
No plot details are available at this time, but it looks like the movie centers on a killer wearing a Winnie the Pooh mask.
Amber Doig-Thorne, Maria Taylor, and Danielle Scott star in the horror movie.

     See The Winnie The Pooh Horror Movie That Is Actually Happening
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, a horror film and what looks to be a slasher flick, is a real thing and it‚Äôs on the way.
As Dread Central and others have reported, Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey is an upcoming horror film and yes, it‚Äôs real.
According to Dread Central, Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey will be a horror ‚Äúretelling‚Äù of the story we‚Äôre all more familiar with.
It‚Äôs tempting to assume Frake-Waterfield has gone out of his way to keep the Winnie the Pooh horror movie under the radar in fear of the notoriously litigious Disney.
There‚Äôs no word on when the Winnie the Pooh horror flick will release.
