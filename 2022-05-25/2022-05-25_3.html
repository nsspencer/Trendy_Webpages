     Miami Heat: Bam Adebayo’s early-career legacy is on the line vs. Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Heading into Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Bam Adebayo’s early-career legacy is on the line for the Miami Heat.
Not only did the Boston Celtics boat-race the Heat from opening tip en route to a 20-point victory, but the Heat looked scared and uninterested.
Not the other three games when he’s looked like Rudy Gobert with handles.
In Game 1, Bam took just four shots.
There is so much on the line for the Heat tonight, but I can’t help but feel that there might be a bit more on the line for Bam.

     Summary: The Miami Heat head into what is sizing up to a be a must-win Game 5 matchup in their Eastern Conference Finals slugfest with the Boston Celtics.
Losing Game 4 in an embarrassing way, the Miami Heat never even showed up to play, it seems.
Jayson Tatum has been guarded by PJ Tucker for 127 possessions this season (regular season and playoffs).
The Miami Heat have the means to stop Jayson Tatum or at least, slow him down.
The Miami Heat have to know this and they have to work just as hard to make sure that they get their ideal defender on him.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Whatever happened last game is last game, regardless if we won by 25 or 2," Celtics star Jayson Tatum said after Boston's shootaround Wednesday morning.
We should kind of look at it as a new series, and tonight is a must-win game.
But coming off wins, Boston is a dismal 1-4, with its lone victory coming at home in Game 7 against Milwaukee.
Boston will have guard Marcus Smart and center Robert Williams III available for Game 5 after both were listed as questionable for a second straight game.
He also sat out Boston's Game 3 loss in this series with soreness in that knee, then returned in Game 4 -- and he appeared to be limping at times in the third quarter.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Without Jimmy Butler playing at the elite level he has flashed at times this postseason, Miami has looked overmatched by a Boston Celtics team that flexes a stifling defense.
Midway through the 3rd quarter of Game 5, LA Clippers forward Marcus Morris questioned why his brother Markieff had yet to see the floor:Markieff Morris has appeared in just one game this postseason, as he is not currently a rotation piece for Erik Spoelstra and the Miami Heat.
With the team's shooters struggling to knock down shots, Marcus Morris is confused why his brother cannot see any playing time.
With the LA Clippers eliminated, Marcus Morris has had a chance to tune in for his brother's games; however, he has not been able to see him play any meaningful minutes.
With Miami struggling the way they are, Marcus wonders if perhaps it's time to shake things up.

     Summary: Chris Mannix and Howard Beck break down an ugly Eastern Conference finals that has been back and forth, and why Jayson Tatum is the key to the Celtics winning the series.
But I was at Game 4 in Boston and my biggest takeaway, Howard, is that the Celtics are just better.
So, you know, it’s 2–2 going down to Miami, the Heat have home court advantage going into Game 5.
But I think it’s exacerbated by the fact that the Miami Heat just weren’t a great offensive team to begin with.
So I looked this up because I was curious: Jimmy averaged 21.4 points a game in the regular season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: May 25, 2022 at 9:47 PM EDTThe only positive for Boston in the first half was Derrick White looking good on both ends, controlling the pace well with Marcus Smart limited and his only miss being a last-second 3 when Jaylen Brown bailed the ball out to him.
Spo leaned into the Duncan Robinson experiment and kept running him over DHOs, but White did a great job staying on his hip and keeping him from getting clean looks at 3.
Robinson was moving well and really could have buried the Celtics, but they let PJ Tucker offensive rebounds and bizarre turnovers do that for them instead.
Boston is fortunate the Heat are shooting so poorly in the half-court.

Before moving ahead to Game 6, though, here's a look at four key takeaways from Boston's Game 5 victory.
Historically, teams that win Game 5 in that scenario go on to win the series nearly 82 percent of the time.
A forgettable game for Lowry, StrusKyle Lowry has been dealing with a hamstring injury throughout the postseason, but he played in Game 5 against the Celtics, and he was downright bad.
As a team, Miami took 45 3-pointers, and they made just seven of them.
