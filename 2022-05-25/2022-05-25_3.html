     In testimony, Kate Moss quashes rumor that Johnny Depp pushed her down stairs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kate Moss kept it short Wednesday while testifying at the Virginia defamation trial going on between former spouses Johnny Depp and Amber Heard: He didn’t do what that old rumor alleged he did.
“He never pushed me, kicked me or threw me down any stairs,” Moss said of Depp while appearing via live video from Gloucestershire, England.
Later Wednesday, during his own rebuttal testimony, Depp said Moss told the story exactly as it had happened.
“I don’t hesitate, I don’t wait — I just, in my head, instantly think of Kate Moss and stairs.”After she said that, Depp attorney Benjamin Chew did a small, celebratory fist-pump, knowing that the door to Moss testifying had been opened.
Heard had already testified in Depp’s U.K. defamation trial that she had “heard the rumor he pushed an ex-girlfriend down the stairs — I think it was Kate Moss.”Henriquez is Heard’s only eyewitness to alleged violence by Depp.
