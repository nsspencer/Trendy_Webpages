     Kate Moss Denies Johnny Depp Pushed Her Down Stairs In Court Testimony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch : Why Johnny Depp WON'T LOOK at Amber Heard In CourtKate Moss just shut down an allegation Amber Heard brought up in court about their mutual ex Johnny Depp.
Appearing through video link, the supermodel testified before a Fairfax, Virginia jury as a rebuttal witness for the former couple's defamation trial on May 25.
Weeks earlier, Heard told the court that during an alleged confrontation with Depp, which also involved the actress' sister Whitney, she "instantly" thought "of Kate Moss and stairs."
Moss recalled to the judge an incident that occurred while vacationing with Depp in the '90s.
"We were leaving the room and Johnny left the room before I did," she said, "and there had been a rain storm and as I left the room, I slipped down the stairs and I hurt my back."

     In testimony, Kate Moss quashes rumor that Johnny Depp pushed her down stairs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kate Moss kept it short Wednesday while testifying at the Virginia defamation trial going on between former spouses Johnny Depp and Amber Heard: He didn’t do what that old rumor alleged he did.
“He never pushed me, kicked me or threw me down any stairs,” Moss said of Depp while appearing via live video from Gloucestershire, England.
Later Wednesday, during his own rebuttal testimony, Depp said Moss told the story exactly as it had happened.
“I don’t hesitate, I don’t wait — I just, in my head, instantly think of Kate Moss and stairs.”After she said that, Depp attorney Benjamin Chew did a small, celebratory fist-pump, knowing that the door to Moss testifying had been opened.
Heard had already testified in Depp’s U.K. defamation trial that she had “heard the rumor he pushed an ex-girlfriend down the stairs — I think it was Kate Moss.”Henriquez is Heard’s only eyewitness to alleged violence by Depp.
