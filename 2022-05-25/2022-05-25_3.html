     Josh Duggar Is Sentenced to 12 Years for Downloading Images of Child Sex Abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Duggar, a onetime star of the TLC reality show “19 Kids and Counting,” about a large family guided by conservative Christian values, was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison on Wednesday for downloading child sexual abuse imagery.
The sentencing, in U.S. District Court in Fayetteville, Ark., concluded Mr. Duggar’s downfall from the eldest sibling on one of the most popular cable reality shows to a convicted criminal, capping a reversal that began with his arrest in April 2021.
Prosecutors said that, in May 2019, Mr. Duggar installed a password-protected partition on the hard drive of his desktop computer at his used-car lot in Springdale, Ark., to avoid software that detects explicit images of children.
Mr. Duggar, 34, who is married with seven children, downloaded around 600 photographs and seven videos of violent child sexual abuse, according to a sentencing memorandum filed this month by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Arkansas.

     Josh Duggar sentenced to more than 12 years in federal prison on child pornography charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) An Arkansas federal judge sentenced former reality TV star Josh Duggar to more than 12 years in federal prison on Wednesday, according to court documents.
US District Judge Timothy Brooks also sentenced Duggar to 20 years of supervised release, a $10,000 fine and is ordered to have no unsupervised contact with minors during supervised release.
Duggar was found guilty by a jury of receipt of child pornography and possession of child pornography in December.
CNN has reached out to Duggar's attorney for comment but did not immediately hear back.
Duggar is the oldest son of Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar, whose family and devout Christian lifestyle were the subject of the TLC show "19 Kids and Counting."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former reality TV star Josh Duggar was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in federal prison on Wednesday for receiving and possessing child sex abuse images, officials said.
The files included "images of prepubescent children and depictions of sadistic abuse," the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
Presiding Judge Timothy L. Brooks dropped one charge and ruled that Duggar didn't knowingly distribute child sex abuse images.
TLC canceled "19 Kids and Counting" in 2015, following revelations that Duggar molested five children, including four of his own sisters.
Two of his sisters spoke about the alleged abuse, which Duggar was never charged with, in an interview with Fox News that year.

     Josh Duggar Sentenced To Prison in Federal Child Pornography Case

     Summary: Josh Duggar, former star of TLC's "19 Kids and Counting," was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison on federal charges of downloading and possessing child sex abuse images.
Prosecutors had called for the Fayetteville, Arkansas judge to sentence Duggar to 20 years in prison on the grounds that he had a "deep-seated, pervasive and violent sexual interest in children," reported the AP.
In December, Duggar was convicted of "receipt and possession of child pornography," carrying a possible sentence of anywhere from five to 20 years of imprisonment.
Duggar’s parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, said he had confessed to the fondling and apologized.
A spin-off show featuring the Duggar family, “Counting On,” was canceled in June 2021.
