     'It is truly special': Emotional Mourinho revels in more European glory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Reuters) An emotional Jose Mourinho celebrated what he called an historic achievement having become the second manager to win five major European titles after Giovanni Trapattoni as his AS Roma side clinched the Europa Conference League on Wednesday.
Mourinho, who had previously won the Champions League, Europa League and the UEFA Cup, completed a unique European trophy haul as Roma beat Feyenoord 1-0 in Tirana to ensure he could add the inaugural Conference League to his collection.
That is five European finals for Porto, Inter Milan, Manchester United and Roma since 2003 that Mourinho has coached in and five times he has taken home the trophy.
"The great thing about my career is that, aside from the Europa League with Manchester United, doing it with Porto, Inter and Roma is very, very, very special," Mourinho said.
"It is one thing to win when everyone expects it, when you made the investments to win, but it's quite another to win when something feels immortal, that feels truly special.

At the final whistle, Mourinho held up five fingers to signify his five European titles as he jumped up and down in celebration.
Now I’m Romanista.
Or Leonardo Spinazzola, the speedy fullback who ruptured his Achilles tendon during the quarterfinals of Italy’s Euro 2020 run, returning in time to finally play in — and win — a European final.
He achieved something that former captains Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi never did at Roma — winning a European trophy.

     Zaniolo goal earns Roma first Europa Conference League title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TIRANA, May 25 (Reuters) - Nicolo Zaniolo's goal earned AS Roma a first major European title in more than 60 years after a 1-0 win over Feyenoord in the Europa Conference League final in Albania on Wednesday, completing a unique European trophy haul for Jose Mourinho.
Roma coach Mourinho, who had previously won the Champions League, Europa League and the UEFA Cup with other clubs, can now add the third-tier European title -- the Italian side's first trophy in 14 years -- to his medal tally.
That ensured that Mourinho became the first manager to win a European trophy with four different clubs, after previous successes at Porto, Inter Milan and Manchester United.
Given both Roma and Feyenoord came into the contest having already secured Europa League football for next season through their domestic league position, it was all about the glory in Tirana.
Zaniolo also became the youngest Italian to score in a major European final since Alessandro Del Piero against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League in May 1997.

     Mourinho’s Roma Wins First UEFA Europa Conference League Title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s Roma’s first European trophy since winning the 1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup — a tournament considered to be the precursor to the UEFA Cup and Europa League.
It’s also the first title of any kind for Roma since winning the 2008 Italian Cup.
Two separate groups of Dutch and Italian fans clashed with police on Tuesday in the city, injuring 19 officers and five Albanian civilians.
Mourinho extended his perfect record in European finals to five trophies in five matches, having also won the 2003 UEFA Cup and 2004 Champions League finals with Porto; the 2010 Champions League final with Inter Milan; and the 2017 Europa League final with Manchester United.
Roma had lost its two previous continental finals, defeated by domestic rival Inter Milan in the 1991 UEFA Cup and dropping a penalty shootout to Liverpool in the 1984 European Cup final in its home stadium.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Julien Laurens dives into Roma's 1-0 win over Feyenoord in the UEFA Europa Conference League final and how the trophy adds to Jose Mourinho's legacy.
Mourinho, who had previously won the Champions League, Europa League and the UEFA Cup, completed a unique European trophy haul as Roma beat Feyenoord 1-0 in Tirana to ensure he could add the inaugural Conference League to his collection.
The win also makes him the only coach in European history to have won the Champions League, Europa League, UEFA Super Cup and, now, the Conference League.
Jose Mourinho celebrates with the UEFA Europa Conference League trophy after Roma's win over Feyenoord in the final.
It's a bit of cliche, but it was 20 years ago that we last played in a European final.
