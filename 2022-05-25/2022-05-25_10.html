     Vigil and rally planned for second anniversary of George Floyd killing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MINNEAPOLIS — A candlelight vigil to honor George Floyd’s memory at the intersection where he died was among the remembrances scheduled for Wednesday’s second anniversary of the Black man’s killing at the hands of Minneapolis police officers.
Activists planned the vigil, along with a rally at the governor’s residence in St. Paul, for the two-year anniversary of Floyd’s death on May 25, 2020, which ignited protests in Minneapolis and around the world as bystander video quickly spread.
AdvertisementThe intersection of 38th and Chicago streets became known informally as George Floyd Square in the wake of his death, with a large sculpture of a clenched fist as the centerpiece of memorials.
The city planned to unveil a street sign officially dubbing the corner George Perry Floyd Square just ahead of the vigil, with Floyd’s brother Terrence among those attending.
Floyd, 46, died after Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pinned his knee on Floyd’s neck for 9 1/2 minutes as Floyd was handcuffed and pleaded that he couldn’t breathe.

     WATCH LIVE: Biden signs executive order on police reform 2 years after the murder of George Floyd
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — With Congress deadlocked over how to address racism and excessive use of force, President Joe Biden plans to sign an executive order on policing Wednesday, the second anniversary of George Floyd’s death.
WATCH: Three decades after Rodney King’s beating, police reform in Los Angeles remains elusiveMost of the order is focused on federal law enforcement agencies — for example, requiring them to review and revise policies on use of force.
“George Floyd woke us up, and we should not go back to sleep,” Sharpton said in a statement.
Biden is expected to appear alongside relatives of Floyd, whose killing by Minneapolis police sparked nationwide protests two years ago.
When former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted last year for killing Floyd, Biden urged Congress to pass legislation to reform police by the anniversary of his death.

     Biden to sign police reform executive order on George Floyd anniversary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: White House officials said the signing would mark the second anniversary of the murder of George Floyd, who died when a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.
Pressure has been building on the White House since the collapse of negotiations over a police reform bill named in Floyd’s honor.
“There’s no better way to honor George Floyd’s legacy than for President Biden to take action by signing a police reform executive order.”The order applies only to federal agencies.
On a call with reporters on Tuesday night, White House officials said the order was no substitute for legislative action.
“We started with the backbone of the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act,” a senior White House official said.

"Just to remember, just to really feel the importance of defunding the police and really changing our city and changing our state … it's helpful to actually have a place to remind us of that."
I'm going to still be here every day.
I'm going to still be out here to honor George."

"If they [showed] this level of respect to George Floyd for attempting to spend a fake $20 bill, he would be alive."
"Since the death of George Floyd, there have been ups and downs," said Tolu Odunsi, a lecturer of law at the University at Buffalo.
It is in Buffalo, after all, where protests in the wake of Floyd's killing made national headlines for police officers' response to peaceful demonstrators.
But the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which Biden had endorsed, remains stalled in Congress.

     Summary: Floyd, aged 46, was being arrested on suspicion of attempting to pass a counterfeit bill at a neighbourhood convenience store.
“For the two-year anniversary, it’s woefully underwhelming and not at all something that befits the memory of George Floyd,” Melina Abdullah, a Black Lives Matter grassroots organiser, told Al Jazeera.
Chauvin pleaded guilty in December 2021 to federal charges of violating Floyd’s civil rights, averting a potential penalty of life in prison if convicted at trial.
Reform measuresPolice reform legislation – titled the “George Floyd Justice in Policing Act” – passed the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives in March 2021 on a largely party-line vote.
“Two years after George Floyd’s murder, police violence is the norm and police killings are on the rise,” the Black Lives Matter foundation said in April when Lyoya was killed.

     Two-year anniversary of George Floyd killing: Joe Biden to sign historic order on policing reform
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden 's push to redesign policing regulations, which has been hindered by Republican resistance in Congress, will come to shape in a more defined executive order.
The same plan is to be endorsed on Wednesday, the second commemoration of the police killing of George Floyd .
Senior organization authorities said Biden would sign the order at a ceremony held at the White House, which will also invite the families of people killed by police, along with the members of the law enforcement, individuals from Congress and individuals from his Cabinet.
Reformers say such a data set could forestall officials who are terminated for misconduct in one locale from securing new police positions somewhere else.
In the months that followed George Floyd's killing, dissidents rampaged in Minneapolis and around the country to fight police severity and prejudice.
