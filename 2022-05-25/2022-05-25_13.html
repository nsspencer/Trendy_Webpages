     Vigil and rally set Wednesday for 2nd anniversary of George Floyd’s death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A candlelight vigil to honor George Floyd’s memory at the intersection where he died was among the remembrances scheduled for Wednesday’s second anniversary of his killing at the hands of Minneapolis police officers.
The city plans to unveil a street sign officially dubbing the corner George Perry Floyd Square just ahead of the vigil, with Floyd’s brother Terrence among those attending.
Floyd, 46, died after Chauvin pinned his knee on Floyd’s neck for 9½ minutes as Floyd was handcuffed and pleaded that he couldn’t breathe.
Chauvin is serving 22½ years in prison after being convicted of state charges of murder and manslaughter last year.
Former officers J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao are scheduled to stand trial on state charges in June.

     Biden to sign police reform executive order on George Floyd anniversary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: White House officials said the signing would mark the second anniversary of the murder of George Floyd, who died when a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.
Pressure has been building on the White House since the collapse of negotiations over a police reform bill named in Floyd’s honor.
“There’s no better way to honor George Floyd’s legacy than for President Biden to take action by signing a police reform executive order.”The order applies only to federal agencies.
On a call with reporters on Tuesday night, White House officials said the order was no substitute for legislative action.
“We started with the backbone of the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act,” a senior White House official said.

     WATCH LIVE: Biden signs executive order on police reform 2 years after the murder of George Floyd
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — With Congress deadlocked over how to address racism and excessive use of force, President Joe Biden plans to sign an executive order on policing Wednesday, the second anniversary of George Floyd’s death.
WATCH: Three decades after Rodney King’s beating, police reform in Los Angeles remains elusiveMost of the order is focused on federal law enforcement agencies — for example, requiring them to review and revise policies on use of force.
“George Floyd woke us up, and we should not go back to sleep,” Sharpton said in a statement.
Biden is expected to appear alongside relatives of Floyd, whose killing by Minneapolis police sparked nationwide protests two years ago.
When former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted last year for killing Floyd, Biden urged Congress to pass legislation to reform police by the anniversary of his death.

     Summary: On 2nd anniversary of George Floyd's killing, Black Buffalo residents feel the weightEnlarge this image toggle caption Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times via Getty Imag Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagWednesday marks the second anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd – a killing that sparked months of protests and impassioned vows from Democratic lawmakers to better protect Black Americans.
"If they [showed] this level of respect to George Floyd for attempting to spend a fake $20 bill, he would be alive."
"Since the death of George Floyd, there have been ups and downs," said Tolu Odunsi, a lecturer of law at the University at Buffalo.
It is in Buffalo, after all, where protests in the wake of Floyd's killing made national headlines for police officers' response to peaceful demonstrators.
But the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which Biden had endorsed, remains stalled in Congress.

Who was George Floyd as a person?
One of the things that I found surprising was that George Floyd's family history includes a period of great wealth.
Reflecting on the last two years, how do you think George Floyd's life has shaped how we view racism?
But it's a constant struggle and I think that's something that's going to be a part of George Floyd's legacy.

     Summary: The two-year anniversary of George Floyd's killing began quietly and with a cold rain Wednesday morning at the corner where he died.
Bertrand works down the street for United Renters for Justice, a tenant advocacy group, and believes it's important for people to keep showing up to the area at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, now memorialized and known as George Floyd Square.
"I think it's still really important to remember why we have this and to remember why this is all here, why the community came together," said Bertrand.
"It's hard to feel like we've made much progress, but I think that underlying the whole uprising and the murder of George Floyd was broader questions of racism and inequity in our society," he said.
An hour later, he recounted how he felt during a city event marking the second anniversary of Floyd's murder.

     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday aimed at reforming policing practices on the second anniversary of the death of George Floyd.
It also restricts the transfer of military equipment to law enforcement agencies and mandates all federal agents wear activated body cameras.
But after the legislation failed to garner bipartisan support, the White House began crafting its own action last year.
President Joe Biden signs an executive order in the East Room of the White House, Wednesday, May 25, 2022.
Under the new executive order, law enforcement will be required to intervene and stop the use of excessive force when they see it and administer medical aid to those who are injured.
