     Colin Kaepernick lands workout with Raiders after 5 years out of NFL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More than five years after he last appeared in an NFL game, free-agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick has landed a workout with the Las Vegas Raiders, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports.
The workout is Kaepernick's first with an NFL team since his time out of the league began following the 2016 season.
Kaepernick told a Detroit television station afterwards that he was just looking "for an opportunity, for a door to open" with an NFL team.
"(I) can still get out there, sling it," Kaepernick told WXYZ Channel 7.
It's notable that the Raiders were the first team in years to offer Kaepernick a workout, given the recent public statements of their owner, Mark Davis.

     Raiders reportedly offer Colin Kaepernick first workout since start of NFL exile
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Kaepernick has his best chance of returning to the NFL since his protest against social injustice effectively exiled him from the league, according to ESPN.
League sources told ESPN that the quarterback will workout for the Las Vegas Raiders this week.
Kaepernick last played in the NFL during the 2016 season, when he knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality and social injustice.
“So, when you’re talking about the people that are in the building, that has never come out that I’ve been a distraction.
“So if you’re talking about the business side, it shows [it’s] beneficial,” he told the I Am Athlete podcast.

     Colin Kaepernick Has Secured a Workout With Raiders, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Kaepernick, who hasn’t played in the NFL since 2016, is scheduled to work out for the Raiders, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
Kaepernick last played for the 49ers and was eventually released at the end of the 2016 season.
He believed he was never signed by an NFL team because of his peaceful protests and the political attention that his kneeling brought.
Derek Carr is the unquestioned starter for the Raiders and Kaepernick would no doubt serve as a backup if he made the roster.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The quarterback was scheduled to work out Wednesday for the Las Vegas Raiders, according to a person familiar with the situation.
“Listen, I believe in Colin Kaepernick and he deserves every chance in the world to become a quarterback in the National Football League,” Davis told NBC last month.
“We, the National Football League, condemn racism and the systematic oppression of black people,” Goodell said then in a video released by the NFL.
“We, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest.
We, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.”Kaepernick played college football at the University of Nevada and once was a standout player who helped the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance.

     Colin Kaepernick working out for Raiders on Wednesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kaepernick went unsigned in the following offseason and has been working toward finding employment in the league.
The 34-year-old is working out for a Raiders club owned by Mark Davis, who previously stated this year that Kaepernick "deserves every chance in the world to become a quarterback in the National Football League.
With Derek Carr firmly situated as the Raiders' starting quarterback, Kaepernick would be competing for a reserve spot in the QB room among Jarrett Stidham, Nick Mullens and Chase Garbers, who are currently on the Las Vegas roster.
In 2019, Kaepernick worked out in front of multiple NFL teams in Atlanta, but no team workouts or offers came from it.
Wednesday's Raiders workout is believed to be Kaepernick's first workout for an individual NFL team since his days with the Niners.
