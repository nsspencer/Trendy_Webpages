     Josh Duggar Is Sentenced to 12 Years for Downloading Images of Child Sex Abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Duggar, a onetime star of the TLC reality show “19 Kids and Counting,” about a large family guided by conservative Christian values, was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison on Wednesday for downloading child sexual abuse imagery.
The sentencing, in U.S. District Court in Fayetteville, Ark., concluded Mr. Duggar’s downfall from the eldest sibling on one of the most popular cable reality shows to a convicted criminal, capping a reversal that began with his arrest in April 2021.
Prosecutors said that, in May 2019, Mr. Duggar installed a password-protected partition on the hard drive of his desktop computer at his used-car lot in Springdale, Ark., to avoid software that detects explicit images of children.
Mr. Duggar, 34, who is married with seven children, downloaded around 600 photographs and seven videos of violent child sexual abuse, according to a sentencing memorandum filed this month by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Arkansas.

     Josh Duggar Has Been Sentenced To 12.5 Years In Prison Over Child Sexual Abuse Materials
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Duggar was sentenced to 12.5 years in prison on Wednesday for receiving child sexual abuse material, including a video that one investigator described as among the worst he had ever seen.
Prosecutors had asked that he serve the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while Duggar’s defense team had asked for five.
“Duggar has a deep-seated, pervasive, and violent sexual interest in children,” Assistant US Attorney Dustin Roberts wrote in a sentencing memo.
"There is no merit to Mr. Duggar’s argument in favor of acquittal," the judge wrote.
After a lengthy hearing Wednesday in which he heard a number of objections from the defense, the judge sentenced Duggar to 151 months in prison.

     Reality TV’s Josh Duggar gets 12 years in child porn case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (AP) — Former reality TV star Josh Duggar was sentenced Wednesday to about 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of receiving child pornography.
Duggar was also convicted of possessing child pornography in December, but U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks dismissed that conviction after ruling that, under federal law, it was an included offense in the receiving child pornography count.
Duggar was arrested in April 2021 after a Little Rock police detective found child porn files were being shared by a computer traced to Duggar.
“Duggar accepts that he is before this Court for sentencing and that this Court must impose a penalty,” his attorneys wrote.
But Duggar also appeals to this Court’s discretion to temper that justice with mercy.”Copyright 2022 The Associated Press.
