     Celtics injury report: Marcus Smart, Robert Williams available for Game 5 against Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MIAMI — The Celtics will be at just about full health for their crucial Game 5 against the Heat on Wednesday.
Both Marcus Smart and Robert Williams III are available to play, the Celtics announced shortly before tipoff.
He’s a crucial piece for the Celtics and Williams’ defense and lob threat add a different dimension to the lineup.
Williams only played 19 minutes in Game 4 against the Heat, putting up 12 points and nine rebounds in the Celtics’ victory.
The blowout was also good for the C’s as they were able to limit Williams’ minutes and workload before the knee worsened.

     Summary: The Celtics will have their starting lineup intact for Wednesday's pivotal Game 5 of an Eastern Conference Finals series that's become a best-of-three.
Marcus Smart (right ankle sprain) and Robert Williams (left knee soreness) are available for Wednesday's matchup in South Beach.
Smart missed Game 4 after badly rolling his ankle in Saturday's loss.
Herro injured his groin in Game 3, and it may keep him out for the remainder of the series.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Whatever happened last game is last game, regardless if we won by 25 or 2," Celtics star Jayson Tatum said after Boston's shootaround Wednesday morning.
We should kind of look at it as a new series, and tonight is a must-win game.
But coming off wins, Boston is a dismal 1-4, with its lone victory coming at home in Game 7 against Milwaukee.
Boston will have guard Marcus Smart and center Robert Williams III available for Game 5 after both were listed as questionable for a second straight game.
He also sat out Boston's Game 3 loss in this series with soreness in that knee, then returned in Game 4 -- and he appeared to be limping at times in the third quarter.

Against a terrorizing Celtics defense, that isn’t enough.
