    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Korean automaker Hyundai is recalling hundreds of vehicles due to a malfunction related to the seat belt.
The recall came after U.S government regulators warned that the seat belt pretensioner, an important safety device that tightens and locks the seat belt in place during the event of a crash was malfunctioning.
The vehicles that have been recalled include the 2019-2022 Hyundai Accents, 2021-2023 Hyundai Elantras, and 2021-2022 Hyundai Elantra HEVs.
They will be sent instructions to take their cars to a Hyundai dealer for a seat belt pretensioner fastened with a cap, this cap prevents the pretensioner from being opened.

     Hyundai recalls thousands of cars over exploding seat belt tighteners
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — Korean automaker Hyundai is recalling 239,000 cars because the seat belt parts can explode and injure vehicle occupants.
Three injuries have been reported, two in the U.S. and one in Singapore.
Government regulators said that the driver’s and front passenger’s seat belt pretensioners, which tighten the belts in preparation for a crash, can explode upon deployment and send shrapnel throughout the vehicle.
The recall expands and replaces three previous recalls, and includes 2019-2022 Accents, 2021-2023 Elantras and 2021-2022 Elantra HEVs.
Vehicle owners will be able to bring their cars to dealerships to have the pretensioners fitted with a cap free of charge.
