     Josh Duggar Is Sentenced to 12 Years for Downloading Images of Child Sex Abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Duggar, a onetime star of the TLC reality show “19 Kids and Counting,” about a large family guided by conservative Christian values, was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison on Wednesday for downloading child sexual abuse imagery.
The sentencing, in U.S. District Court in Fayetteville, Ark., concluded Mr. Duggar’s downfall from the eldest sibling on one of the most popular cable reality shows to a convicted criminal, capping a reversal that began with his arrest in April 2021.
Prosecutors said that, in May 2019, Mr. Duggar installed a password-protected partition on the hard drive of his desktop computer at his used-car lot in Springdale, Ark., to avoid software that detects explicit images of children.
Mr. Duggar, 34, who is married with seven children, downloaded around 600 photographs and seven videos of violent child sexual abuse, according to a sentencing memorandum filed this month by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Arkansas.

     Josh Duggar Has Been Sentenced To 12.5 Years In Prison Over Child Sexual Abuse Materials
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Duggar was sentenced to 12.5 years in prison on Wednesday for receiving child sexual abuse material, including a video that one investigator described as among the worst he had ever seen.
Prosecutors had asked that he serve the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while Duggar’s defense team had asked for five.
“Duggar has a deep-seated, pervasive, and violent sexual interest in children,” Assistant US Attorney Dustin Roberts wrote in a sentencing memo.
"There is no merit to Mr. Duggar’s argument in favor of acquittal," the judge wrote.
After a lengthy hearing Wednesday in which he heard a number of objections from the defense, the judge sentenced Duggar to 151 months in prison.

     Josh Duggar sentenced to more than 12 years in federal prison on child pornography charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) An Arkansas federal judge sentenced former reality TV star Josh Duggar to more than 12 years in federal prison on Wednesday, according to court documents.
US District Judge Timothy Brooks also sentenced Duggar to 20 years of supervised release, a $10,000 fine and is ordered to have no unsupervised contact with minors during supervised release.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadFormer reality television star Josh Duggar was sentenced Wednesday to 151 months — or about 12½ years — in prison as part of his child pornography case, according to the Associated Press.
An Arkansas jury in December found Duggar guilty of both receiving and possessing child pornography.
His attorney Justin Gelfand confirmed to The Washington Post on Wednesday that the second count, which was for possessing child pornography, had been dropped during the sentencing.
Later that year, TLC greenlit the “19 Kids and Counting” spinoff series “Counting On,” which featured the Duggar family members apart from Josh.
The show was canceled in April 2021 after he was arrested on child pornography charges.
