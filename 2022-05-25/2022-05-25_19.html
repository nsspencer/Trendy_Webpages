     Barcelona beats A-League All-Stars 3-2 in Down Under debut

     Summary: FC Barcelona pose for ateam photo ahead of friendly soccer match against the A-League All Stars' at Stadium Australia in Sydney, Australia, Wednesday, May 25, 2022.
(AP Photo/Rick Rycroft) APBarcelona's first-ever match in Australia ended in a 3-2 victory over an A-League All-Star team on Wednesday with substitute Ansu Fati scoring the winning goal.
Before 70,174 spectators at the Olympic Stadium, Barcelona led 1-0 at halftime after Ousmane Dembele scored in the bottom right corner in the 34th minute.
But his opposing namesake — Adama Traore — leveled for Barcelona in the 72nd minute before Fati's winner five minutes later.
Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke made his full-time coaching debut in the match when he led the All-Stars.

     The teenage Socceroos hopeful in hot demand after Barcelona blitz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Garang Kuol showed why he is one of the most exciting Australian players of his generation with a scintillating cameo against Barcelona which earned him rich praise from coaches Xavi and Dwight Yorke – and the shirt of star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.
Clubs in Germany and the Netherlands were, according to sources close to the player, already tracking the 17-year-old’s progress closely after his emergence for the Central Coast Mariners this season, having scored five eye-catching goals off the bench in just 229 minutes of senior football in all competitions.
But there could soon be a bidding war for his services after Kuol did his transfer prospects no harm at Accor Stadium in Wednesday night’s friendly, enthralling a crowd of more than 70,000 with two brilliant runs that carved through Barcelona’s defence and should have both ended in goals for the A-League All Stars.
They ultimately fell 3-2 to the visiting La Liga outfit but it was Kuol’s name on everyone’s lips after the full-time whistle – including Xavi, Barcelona’s manager, who described his performance as “unbelievable” and admitted he didn’t initially believe Yorke, the All Stars coach, when he told him at half-time he was about to inject a teenager with serious potential into the match.

     A-League All Stars 2-3 Barcelona: Match Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona took a trip to Australia after wrapping up the regular season to take on the vest best the A-League has to offer.
After a tightly contested opening half-an-hour, Barcelona took the lead through Ousmane Dembele, who found himself unmarked on the left-wing.
The Australian forward then completely overturned the deficit with an assist to left-back Adama Traore, who marauded down the flank to score for the All Stars.
His namesake, Barcelona’s Adama Traore, took that personally, and got his first – and possible last – goal in Barcelona’s colours in the 71st minute.
This officially brings the season to a close for Barcelona.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Barcelona took the stage to face the A-League All Stars on Wednesday night they were met with a spectacle worthy of a grand final.
Still fresh from a 2-0 end-of-season defeat to Villarreal, the travelling side had been on Australian soil for barely 36 hours before kick-off.
Their opposition had been frantically assembled from the pool of players not involved in this weekend’s A-League Men grand final.
“I have to congratulate them because they played so good, so good,” Xavi said afterwards.
Garang Kuol nearly scores to put the A-League All-Stars 3-1 up in Sydney.
