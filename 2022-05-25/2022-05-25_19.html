     Barcelona scrape through on another night for the dreamers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At the end of another forgettable season for the A-Leagues, here’s some much-needed good news: there are still loads of people who love football in Australia and are happy to pay money to watch it live.
The challenge, as it has been for decades, is grabbing their attention.
By far the biggest sporting crowd in Sydney since the pandemic, 70,174 fans, watched Barcelona claim a thrilling 3-2 win over the A-Leagues All Stars at Accor Stadium on Wednesday night - the first in a packed schedule of glamour friendlies that will be played here during the European off-season.
The second-biggest crowd?
That was football, too, when 41,582 came to the same venue in March to see Australia’s direct World Cup qualification hopes disintegrate as the Socceroos fell 2-0 to Japan.

     Summary: Before 70,174 spectators at the Olympic Stadium, Barcelona led 1-0 at halftime after Ousmane Dembele scored in the bottom right corner in the 34th minute.
Rene Piscopo leveled for the All-Stars in the 47th minute and the home side took the lead when Adama Traore scored in the 53rd.
But his opposing namesake — Adama Traore — leveled for Barcelona in the 72nd minute before Fati’s winner five minutes later.
It was a big surprise for us because I don’t follow the A-League a lot.”The list of absent Barcelona players was a long one.
Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke made his full-time coaching debut in the match when he led the All-Stars.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona took a trip to Australia after wrapping up the regular season to take on the vest best the A-League has to offer.
After a tightly contested opening half-an-hour, Barcelona took the lead through Ousmane Dembele, who found himself unmarked on the left-wing.
The Australian forward then completely overturned the deficit with an assist to left-back Adama Traore, who marauded down the flank to score for the All Stars.
His namesake, Barcelona’s Adama Traore, took that personally, and got his first – and possible last – goal in Barcelona’s colours in the 71st minute.
This officially brings the season to a close for Barcelona.
