     ‘Survivor’ finale is at hand: Can Alabama’s Jonathan Young win it?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the season finale of “Survivor” concludes Wednesday night, will Jonathan Young of Gulf Shores be standing tall as the winner?
In this cast, Young stood out for his strength and general physical condition, but also for his comfort level in this particular setting.
He won a nasty immunity challenge against Lindsay Dolashewich, the only competitor who has been able to regularly compete with him in the physical challenges.
More negotiating and another immunity challenge will determine the Final Three, but in the Season 41 finale this was accomplished without a tribal council.
The immunity winner made it; the other two were determined partly by the immunity winner, who got to pick a friend, and partly by a fire-making challenge.

     Survivor 42: A History Of The Final 4 Fire-Making Challenge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before the fire-making challenge was implemented in Survivor: Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers, the castaways had a traditional vote at final four.
Now, there is no vote, and the castaway who wins the final immunity challenge decides who will join them at the final tribal council.
The fire-making challenge gives the castaways a final chance to take their fates in the game into their own hands, and earn spots at the final tribal council.
In the following season of Survivor: Ghost Island, the winner of the season, Wendell Holland, also won the fire-making challenge.
The Survivor 42 finale airs this week, and two of the remaining castaways will battle it out in a fire-making challenge for a spot at the final tribal council.
