     Who Is TMZ's Morgan Tremaine? 'Journalist's Privilege' in Depp-Heard Trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lawyers for celebrity news outlet have intervened to prevent Morgan Tremaine from testifying and potentially revealing an anonymous source, on the grounds of "journalist's privilege."
Tremaine was set to be the latest witness to take the stand, but TMZ has temporarily prevented that from happening.
What Is 'Journalist's Privilege'?
Journalist's privilege, more commonly known as reporter's privilege, is a law put in place to allow a journalist to protect their confidential or anonymous sources from discovery.
While TMZ is citing journalist's privilege, it is currently unclear whether it will be successful with their motion.

     Judge rules against TMZ, allows Johnny Depp to call ex-employee to testify
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Virginia judge ruled against TMZ on Wednesday, allowing its former employee to testify in Johnny Depp’s bombshell defamation case against Amber Heard.
“We are seeking to intervene to protect the relationship and their sources,” TMZ lawyer Charles Tobin told the judge.
REUTERSTMZ had argued that Tremaine shouldn’t be forced to give up information about a source who provided him with a video showing Depp yelling at Heard.
Heard countersued for $100 million, claiming that Depp defamed her when he said she lied about the abuse allegations.

     Ex-TMZ Employee Testifies Cut of Johnny Depp ‘Kitchen Cabinet’ Video That Tabloid Received Didn’t Show Amber Heard ‘Seemingly Snickering’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last month during the ex-couple’s trial, a jury saw footage of Depp appears angry in their West Hollywood home, and Heard tapes him.
“When I had clicked the direct link that we received and watched the video in its entirety.
It was much shorter than the video we had received— the video that’s been played in this trial,” Tremaine testified.
Tremaine said he received a similar instruction months later on Aug. 6, when he dispatched paparazzi to Heard’s law firm.
Just as TMZ asserted, Tremaine testified that he did not know the source of the video transferred through the organization’s email tip line.
