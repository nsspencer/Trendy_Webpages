     Fati gets late winner as Barcelona down All Stars 3-2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sydney (AFP) – Teenage striker Ansu Fati got a late winner as Barcelona survived a scare to beat Dwight Yorke's A-League All Stars in a 3-2 thriller in front of 70,000 fans in Sydney on Wednesday.
But the All Stars stunned them with two goals in eight second-half minutes, before Xavi Hernandez's side rallied to retake control with strikes from Adama Traore and Fati.
A-League All Stars' Garang Kuol hit the post during their 302 loss to Barcelona DAVID GRAY AFPBut the All Stars came out firing in the second half.
Fati got the winner five minutes later, curling the ball into the net after good work from Antonio Aranda.
The All Stars nearly ruined the party, Garang Kuol rattling the post with three minutes left.

     The teenage Socceroos hopeful in hot demand after Barcelona blitz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Garang Kuol showed why he is one of the most exciting Australian players of his generation with a scintillating cameo against Barcelona which earned him rich praise from coaches Xavi and Dwight Yorke – and the shirt of star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.
Clubs in Germany and the Netherlands were, according to sources close to the player, already tracking the 17-year-old’s progress closely after his emergence for the Central Coast Mariners this season, having scored five eye-catching goals off the bench in just 229 minutes of senior football in all competitions.
But there could soon be a bidding war for his services after Kuol did his transfer prospects no harm at Accor Stadium in Wednesday night’s friendly, enthralling a crowd of more than 70,000 with two brilliant runs that carved through Barcelona’s defence and should have both ended in goals for the A-League All Stars.
They ultimately fell 3-2 to the visiting La Liga outfit but it was Kuol’s name on everyone’s lips after the full-time whistle – including Xavi, Barcelona’s manager, who described his performance as “unbelievable” and admitted he didn’t initially believe Yorke, the All Stars coach, when he told him at half-time he was about to inject a teenager with serious potential into the match.

     A-League All Stars 2-3 Barcelona: Match Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona took a trip to Australia after wrapping up the regular season to take on the vest best the A-League has to offer.
After a tightly contested opening half-an-hour, Barcelona took the lead through Ousmane Dembele, who found himself unmarked on the left-wing.
The Australian forward then completely overturned the deficit with an assist to left-back Adama Traore, who marauded down the flank to score for the All Stars.
His namesake, Barcelona’s Adama Traore, took that personally, and got his first – and possible last – goal in Barcelona’s colours in the 71st minute.
This officially brings the season to a close for Barcelona.
