     Colin Kaepernick lands workout with Raiders after 5 years out of NFL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More than five years after he last appeared in an NFL game, free-agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick has landed a workout with the Las Vegas Raiders, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports.
The workout is Kaepernick's first with an NFL team since his time out of the league began following the 2016 season.
Kaepernick told a Detroit television station afterwards that he was just looking "for an opportunity, for a door to open" with an NFL team.
"(I) can still get out there, sling it," Kaepernick told WXYZ Channel 7.
It's notable that the Raiders were the first team in years to offer Kaepernick a workout, given the recent public statements of their owner, Mark Davis.

     Raiders reportedly offer Colin Kaepernick first workout since start of NFL exile
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Kaepernick has his best chance of returning to the NFL since his protest against social injustice effectively exiled him from the league, according to ESPN.
League sources told ESPN that the quarterback will workout for the Las Vegas Raiders this week.
Kaepernick last played in the NFL during the 2016 season, when he knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality and social injustice.
“So, when you’re talking about the people that are in the building, that has never come out that I’ve been a distraction.
“So if you’re talking about the business side, it shows [it’s] beneficial,” he told the I Am Athlete podcast.

     Colin Kaepernick Has Secured a Workout With Raiders, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Kaepernick, who hasn’t played in the NFL since 2016, is scheduled to work out for the Raiders, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
Kaepernick last played for the 49ers and was eventually released at the end of the 2016 season.
He believed he was never signed by an NFL team because of his peaceful protests and the political attention that his kneeling brought.
Derek Carr is the unquestioned starter for the Raiders and Kaepernick would no doubt serve as a backup if he made the roster.

     Colin Kaepernick working out with Raiders as door opens for potential NFL return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Kaepernick, who has not played in the NFL since New Year's Day 2017, has taken a step towards returning to football.
He is working out for the Las Vegas Raiders on Wednesday, according to ESPN and confirmed by CBS Sports NFL Insider Josina Anderson.
The 34-year-old hasn't worked out for any team or visited with any team since finishing out the 2016 season.
Kaepernick went 28-30 as a starter during his time with the San Francisco 49ers, throwing 72 touchdowns and 30 interceptions in 69 career games.
A workout does not guarantee the Raiders will sign Kaepernick, but this is a very big development for a potential return to the NFL.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (AP) - Colin Kaepernick is getting his first chance to work out for an NFL team since last playing in the league in 2016 when he started kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial inequality.
Two people familiar with the situation said Kaepernick will work out for the Las Vegas Raiders on Wednesday.
ESPN first reported that the Raiders were bringing in Kaepernick.
Kaepernick never got another opportunity even to work out for NFL teams as he alleged he had been blackballed over his protests during the anthem the previous season.

     Colin Kaepernick working out for Raiders on Wednesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kaepernick went unsigned in the following offseason and has been working toward finding employment in the league.
The 34-year-old is working out for a Raiders club owned by Mark Davis, who previously stated this year that Kaepernick "deserves every chance in the world to become a quarterback in the National Football League.
With Derek Carr firmly situated as the Raiders' starting quarterback, Kaepernick would be competing for a reserve spot in the QB room among Jarrett Stidham, Nick Mullens and Chase Garbers, who are currently on the Las Vegas roster.
In 2019, Kaepernick worked out in front of multiple NFL teams in Atlanta, but no team workouts or offers came from it.
Wednesday's Raiders workout is believed to be Kaepernick's first workout for an individual NFL team since his days with the Niners.
