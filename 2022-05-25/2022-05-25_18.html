     2022 All-NBA teams: The 15 superstars named All-NBA selections
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 All-NBA teams were announced on Tuesday night, and the recent takeover by young superstars led to an historic first-team list.
For the first time since 1955, all five players who made the first team are 27 years old or younger, led by two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was a unanimous first-team selection in 2022.
A total of 100 sportswriters and broadcasters vote on the All-NBA teams.
First-team votes are worth a total of five points, second-team votes are worth three, and third-team votes are worth one point.

     What the 2022 All-NBA team results mean for 6 NBA stars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2021-22 All-NBA teams were announced on Tuesday, and for the most part, the results were exactly what was expected.
Nikola Jokic — the back-to-back MVP this season — made it to the first team alongside Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Devin Booker, and Jayson Tatum.
The second team featured Joel Embiid (positions shouldn’t matter for All-NBA, but I digress) as well as Ja Morant, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and DeMar DeRozan.
Meanwhile, third team consideration was given to Karl-Anthony Towns, LeBron James, Chris Paul, Trae Young, and Pascal Siakam.
But let’s remember: the All-NBA has some contract implications for the players involved (and those who were snubbed).

     Summary: Antetokounmpo was the only player to receive All-NBA First Team votes on all 100 ballots.
The Second Team is headlined by Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid, who led the league in scoring this season and finished second in MVP voting behind Jokic for the second straight season.
Durant now has 10 All-NBA selections to his name.
With his selection, James extended his record for most ever All-NBA Team selections to 18.
Behind James, Paul has the most All-NBA selections among active players with 11.

     Summary: In 2018, Booker signed a five-year, $158 million extension with the Suns.
Because LaVine did not make an All-NBA Team, he is not eligible for a supermax extension.
LaVine signed a four-year, $78 million contract with the Bulls in 2018, making him an unrestricted free agent this offseason.
The most he can sign with the Bulls is a five-year, $212.3 million contract.
The most he can sign with another team is a four-year, $157.4 million contract.
