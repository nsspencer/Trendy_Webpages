     Nvidia Stock Falls on a Weak Outlook. It’s Another Disappointment for Tech.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nvidia shares are trading lower in late trading Wednesday, after the chip maker provided a softer-than-expected outlook for its July quarter.
The company cited the impact of both reduced business in Russia and Covid-related manufacturing shutdowns in China.
In March, Nvidia had announced the halt of all product sales in Russia.
Meanwhile, the issues involving Covid-related manufacturing shutdowns in China are consistent with recent reports from other companies, including both Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Apple (AAPL).

     Nvidia stock falls on light guidance, CFO says company will slow hiring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nvidia will slow down its hiring pace and control expenses as the company deals with a challenging macroeconomic environment, its CFO Colette Kress said after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.
Nvidia beat analyst expectations for sales and earnings, but the stock dropped more than 10% in extended trading at one point after the chipmaker gave a light forecast for the current quarter.
Nvidia stock is down over 43% so far in 2022 as investors shun fast-growing stocks in favor of safer bets during a period of high inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company was facing a "challenging macro environment" in a statement.
Nvidia said its revenue in the current quarter would be $500 million lower than it would have been if not for the Russian war in Ukraine and Covid lockdowns in China.

     Nvidia Stock Sank in After-Hours Trading Today -- Here's Why the Stock Could Be a Solid Buy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What happenedShares of Nvidia (NVDA 5.08%) fell in after-hours trading on Thursday, as investors responded to the chipmaker's lower-than-expected guidance.
Despite supply chain disruptions that have plagued the tech sector, Nvidia was able to manage its costs effectively.
This, combined with Nvidia's strong sales growth, helped its adjusted operating income grow by 55% to $3.96 million.
Nvidia noted that war in Europe and coronavirus-related lockdowns in China were likely to negatively affect its sales results by approximately $500 million.
Thus, patient, long-term-minded investors may wish to use the sell-off as an opportunity to buy the tech leader's shares at a discount.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s similar to Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, +0.53% , which reported its earnings this past week and has an April-ending quarter like Nvidia.
No sales to Russia constitutes a $100 million revenue shortfall in Nvidia’s data-center business, Colette Kress, Nvidia’s chief financial officer, told analysts on the conference call.
In the first quarter, gaming sales rose 31% to a record $3.62 billion from $2.76 billion, while analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected Nvidia gaming sales of $3.46 billion.
“We still believe our end demand remains very strong,” Kress told analysts on the call, adding that gaming revenue is expected to grow on a year-over-year basis.
Analysts had forecast $1.30 a share on revenue of $8.12 billion, based on Nvidia’s forecast of $7.94 billion to $8.26 billion.
