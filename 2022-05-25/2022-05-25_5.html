     Raiders reportedly offer Colin Kaepernick first workout since start of NFL exile
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Kaepernick has his best chance of returning to the NFL since his protest against social injustice effectively exiled him from the league, according to ESPN.
League sources told ESPN that the quarterback will workout for the Las Vegas Raiders this week.
Kaepernick last played in the NFL during the 2016 season, when he knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality and social injustice.
“So, when you’re talking about the people that are in the building, that has never come out that I’ve been a distraction.
“So if you’re talking about the business side, it shows [it’s] beneficial,” he told the I Am Athlete podcast.

     Colin Kaepernick Has Secured a Workout With Raiders, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Kaepernick, who hasn’t played in the NFL since 2016, is scheduled to work out for the Raiders, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.
Kaepernick last played for the 49ers and was eventually released at the end of the 2016 season.
He believed he was never signed by an NFL team because of his peaceful protests and the political attention that his kneeling brought.
Derek Carr is the unquestioned starter for the Raiders and Kaepernick would no doubt serve as a backup if he made the roster.

     Colin Kaepernick completes workout with Las Vegas Raiders, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adam Schefter reports that Colin Kaepernick will have his first NFL workout since becoming a free agent in March 2017.
(1:28)Colin Kaepernick, who last played professional football in 2016 -- the year he started kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice -- worked out Wednesday for the Las Vegas Raiders, a league source told ESPN.
But not only has Kaepernick not signed a contract with any team, he also hasn't received a workout until the one he had Wednesday.
Las Vegas also has quarterback Nick Mullens, who signed with the Raiders this offseason.
Another potential link to Kaepernick is Raiders offensive coordinator Mick Lombardi, who was a 49ers assistant from 2013 to 2016.

“We, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest.
We, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.”Kaepernick played college football at the University of Nevada and once was a standout player who helped the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance.

     Summary: UPDATED: Colin Kaepernick, who has not thrown a pass in the NFL since 2016, will work out this week for the Las Vegas Raiders, according to ESPN’s Senior NFL Insider Adam Schefter.
pic.twitter.com/zAuWybhILx — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) May 25, 2022A little less than a month ago, Raiders owner Mark Davis said of Kaepernick that he “would welcome him with open arms” so long as the team’s coaches and GM were on board.
“He deserves every chance in the world to become a quarterback in the National Football League,” said Davis.
PREVIOUSLY on April 28: “I believe in Colin Kaepernick,” said Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis last night in an interview with NBC Sports Bay Area.
The Raiders have potential backup candidates in Nick Mullens and Garrett Gilbert, each of whom has less experience than Kaepernick.

     Colin Kaepernick working out for Raiders on Wednesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kaepernick went unsigned in the following offseason and has been working toward finding employment in the league.
The 34-year-old is working out for a Raiders club owned by Mark Davis, who previously stated this year that Kaepernick "deserves every chance in the world to become a quarterback in the National Football League.
With Derek Carr firmly situated as the Raiders' starting quarterback, Kaepernick would be competing for a reserve spot in the QB room among Jarrett Stidham, Nick Mullens and Chase Garbers, who are currently on the Las Vegas roster.
In 2019, Kaepernick worked out in front of multiple NFL teams in Atlanta, but no team workouts or offers came from it.
Wednesday's Raiders workout is believed to be Kaepernick's first workout for an individual NFL team since his days with the Niners.
