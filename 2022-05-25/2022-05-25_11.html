     Chicago Fire Answered Some Stellaride And Brettsey Questions In Season 10 Finale, But I Didn't See That Cliffhanger Coming
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Spoilers ahead for the Season 10 finale of Chicago Fire, called "The Magnificent City of Chicago."
The wedding actually went off with just about as few hitches as one could hope for in a One Chicago finale, and the episode delivered some answers that have been a long time coming.
In true Fire style, the finale also ended on a cliffhanger, but not the kind that I was expecting.
What Happened For Stella And SeverideI was wondering basically ever since the showrunners announced that the Season 10 finale would involve the Stellaride wedding if it would actually finish.
Of course, the episode wasn't full of joy for Stellaride, and what went wrong is seemingly what led to the cliffhanger.
