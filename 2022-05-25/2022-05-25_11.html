     Report: Uvalde Gunman Had Accomplices As Far As Washington, D.C
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UVALDE, TX—Uncovering shocking new details about the Robb Elementary School shooting, FBI agents told reporters Wednesday that alleged gunman Salvador Ramos had accomplices as far away as Washington, D.C. “We have reason to believe this wasn’t a ‘lone wolf’ incident, but rather a coordinated attack carried out with the assistance of 535 individuals in the D.C. metropolitan area,” said agency spokesperson Adriana Yaroma, who noted that the case was now being investigated as a federal crime, as the co-conspirators had crossed the borders of every U.S. state.
“This was a highly sophisticated operation backed by millions of dollars, and it appears to have been in the works for decades.
We have evidence these men and women provided the shooter with cover as well as access to the very guns used to perpetrate the murders.
If it weren’t for the cooperation of these incredibly sick individuals, the 21 victims would still be with us today.” At press time, the accomplices had reportedly fled the country before they could be brought in for questioning.

     ‘No Way To Prevent This’: The Onion homepage reflects all recent stories on mass shootings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the country and media networks react to the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas where 21 people – including 19 children – were killed on Tuesday, the satirical news site The Onion has taken a chilling approach.
Typically after a mass shooting occurs in the U.S., the site and social media users will share their infamous headline, "‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens."
In addition to their website, The Onion also posted a Twitter thread of all the times they used the headline referring to a mass shooting, which began in 2014.
Live updates: Texas school rampage victims were inside one classroom; shooter locked the door.
Former managing editor of the site Marnie Shure told Vice in 2017 the headline "really holds up" whenever mass shootings happen.

     Every Time There's A Mass Shooting, The Onion Writes The Same Story. Today, It Featured All 21.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Each time there is a high-profile mass shooting, the satirical website publishes a variation of the exact same story.
Starting with the 2014 attack in Isla Vista, California, that killed six people, the Onion published a piece titled "'No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens."
On Wednesday, the Onion published its 21st variation of the story — this time in response to the murder of 19 elementary school children and two adults in Uvalde, Texas, the previous day.
"If you look, it takes a while — even on the Twitter feed — to scroll through how many times we posted it today," Nackers said.
It takes you probably 30 seconds to scroll through all the articles if you just keep moving.

     Summary: 'The Onion' has republished a grim headline about mass shootings 21 times since 2014Enlarge this image toggle caption Screenshot by NPR Screenshot by NPRThere are a couple of inevitable responses to a mass shooting in America: funerals and fundraisers, prayers from politicians and the resurfacing of one particular article from satirical site The Onion.
"'No Way To Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens" has been republished 21 times in almost exactly eight years.
Its headline has remained the same for every major mass shooting from Isla Vista, Calif., in 2014 to Tuesday's school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.
Jason Roeder, a former writer and editor at The Onion, is credited with creating the original article.
Dave Cullen, a journalist who has covered mass shootings for years and wrote the New York Times bestseller Columbine, told NPR in 2015 that the article "resonates because they totally got it."

     “No Way To Prevent This”: The Onion Blankets Homepage With Same Headline On 20+ Articles Skewering Response To Mass Shootings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Onion blanketed its homepage today with the same article it has posted in response to many other past mass shootings, skewering the idea that such atrocities cannot be stopped.
Each story corresponds to a different mass shooting but with the same headline and quotes.
That was after there was a mass shooting in the Isla Vista community near UC Santa Barbara.
Texas School Shooting: Deadline’s CoverageJason Roeder, former senior writer and editor at The Onion, posted on Twitter in 2018 that he wrote the headline.
At that time, there had just been a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL.

     After Texas School Shooting, The Onion Posts 21 Stories on Homepage With the Same Headline: ‘“No Way to Prevent This,” Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since 2014, satirical website The Onion has published virtually the same article — each with the same headline, “‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens” — 21 times, each one following a major gun massacre in the United States.
On Wednesday, The Onion posted all 21 of the articles on its homepage, calling stark attention to the unabated epidemic of mass gun killings in the country.
That included the latest installment in the series, following the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that left 19 children and two adults dead at an elementary school.
Over this Memorial Day weekend, the NRA has scheduled a pro-gun convention in Houston — boasting “over 14 acres of guns and gear” — with keynote speakers including Donald Trump, Texas Gov.
Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz, along with a concert lineup set to include Lee Greenwood and Larry Gatlin.
