     Summary: People across the U.S. honored George Floyd on Wednesday amid mixed progress on police reform and two years after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nine minutes as he said "I can't breathe" over 20 times.
Momentum dwindled after Congress failed to reach a bipartisan agreement on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
"George Floyd’s brutal death sparked an unprecedented outpouring of outrage and pledges for change worldwide, &amp; we CANNOT stop fighting now," Crump added on Twitter.

     Biden signs police reform executive order on anniversary of George Floyd’s murder

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joe Biden signed an executive order he promised would usher in the “most significant police reform in decades” on Wednesday, the second anniversary of the murder of George Floyd.
In remarks preceding the signing, Biden praised them for their efforts to push for change even as they grieve.
When the ceremony concluded, Biden invited Floyd’s young daughter, Gianna, to sit in his chair and handed her the pen he had used to sign the order.
Three other former officers were convicted in federal court of violating Floyd’s civil rights.
A White House official said the text had been revised and improved based on input from stakeholders but would not say if the document made explicit reference to systemic racism.

Who was George Floyd as a person?
One of the things that I found surprising was that George Floyd's family history includes a period of great wealth.
Reflecting on the last two years, how do you think George Floyd's life has shaped how we view racism?
But it's a constant struggle and I think that's something that's going to be a part of George Floyd's legacy.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wednesday marks the second anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd – a killing that sparked months of protests and impassioned vows from Democratic lawmakers to better protect Black Americans.
"If they [showed] this level of respect to George Floyd for attempting to spend a fake $20 bill, he would be alive."
We all are sick and tired of being sick and tired," Buffalo resident Geo Hernandez said at a recent press conference held by the advocacy organization VOICE.
"Since the death of George Floyd, there have been ups and downs," said Tolu Odunsi, a lecturer of law at the University at Buffalo.
But the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which Biden had endorsed, remains stalled in Congress.

     Summary: The anniversary of Floyd's murder started quietly in the morning at George Floyd Square, a cold spring rain falling.
"It's hard to feel like we've made much progress, but I think that underlying the whole uprising and the murder of George Floyd was broader questions of racism and inequity in our society," he said.
Wednesday evening, about three dozen people gathered in front of the governor's residence in St. Paul to remember Floyd and others killed by law enforcement, including Amir Locke and Jamar Clark.
Back at George Floyd Square, the sign dedication did not start smoothly.
"This is about George Floyd and his family right now."

She said her son was pulled over for having expired tabs, but said he got scared and drove off.
After getting in a chase with Joseph-McDade, officers fired at his car when he started driving towards them.
Under the law Joseph supported in 2021, law enforcement officers can no longer chase after someone for having expired tabs.
Joseph thinks lawmakers won’t forget what happened to Floyd, just like she’ll never forget what happened to her son.
