During the Donald Trump era, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rushed through Trump’s judicial appointees who are Second Amendment ideologues.
“America would not exist without the heroism of the young adults who fought and died in our revolutionary army,” he wrote.
Judge Richardson called such a restriction of the young adults constitutionally arbitrary.

     After Uvalde: What the Second Amendment could learn from the First
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The First Amendment values ideas held by people; the Second Amendment values guns held by people.
Whereas the First is bound by conditions, the Second is bound by afflictions: Yearly dead and wounded exceeding 100,000.
The Second Amendment, as it’s currently interpreted, does not ignore the flaws of humanity; it empowers those flaws.
The whole of the Second Amendment is definitely less than its parts.
The Second Amendment is imperfect – so let’s get to work.

“A well-trained soldier could fire three or four shots in a minute, or every 15 or 20 seconds,” Battlefields.org continued.
Leftists like Moore care little for truth, however, preferring instead to twist history to do today’s Democrat bidding.

     Summary: The gun lobby, the gun nuts and conservative politicians willing to wade through pools of innocent blood in pursuit of campaign donations and votes, usually leave out the first part.
The K-12 School Shooting Database, compiled by the Naval Postgraduate School’s Center for Homeland Defense and Security, said this was the 188th school shooting since 1970.
“As a nation we have to ask, when in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?” Biden asked.
The Texas school shooting comes fast on the heels of the racist murder of 10 Black people at a Buffalo, N.Y., grocery store on Saturday, May 14.
Obama called out the gun lobby and the Republicans who cower before it.
