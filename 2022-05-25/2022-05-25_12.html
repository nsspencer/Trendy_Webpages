     What the 2022 All-NBA team results mean for 6 NBA stars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2021-22 All-NBA teams were announced on Tuesday, and for the most part, the results were exactly what was expected.
Nikola Jokic — the back-to-back MVP this season — made it to the first team alongside Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Devin Booker, and Jayson Tatum.
The second team featured Joel Embiid (positions shouldn’t matter for All-NBA, but I digress) as well as Ja Morant, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and DeMar DeRozan.
Meanwhile, third team consideration was given to Karl-Anthony Towns, LeBron James, Chris Paul, Trae Young, and Pascal Siakam.
But let’s remember: the All-NBA has some contract implications for the players involved (and those who were snubbed).

     Giannis Antetokounmpo Named to 2022 All-NBA First Team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leading the way for the Milwaukee Bucks, as ever, was Giannis Antetokounmpo, and for his trouble he’s garnered 100 out of 100 first-place votes as a forward, making him the only player in the league to be an unanimous first team All-NBA player.
In fact, it is his fourth season in a row pulling off that feat (and sixth season being named to any All-NBA team):Giannis All-NBA First Team votes in the last 4 seasons2018-19: 100/1002019-20: 100/1002020-21: 100/1002021-22: 100/100Best.
That, and the loss of Brook Lopez meant that Antetokounmpo had to trade in his poaching defensive instincts for a true center hard hat.
While Nikola Jokic eventually ran away with MVP voting, for just a split-second it felt like Giannis had turned the conversation his way yet again.
He’s just head and shoulders above most of his peers, even at the very elite top of competition.

     Summary: The 2022 All-NBA teams were announced on Tuesday night, and the recent takeover of young superstars led to a historic first-team list.
For the first time since 1955, all five players who made the first team are 27 years old or younger, led by two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was a unanimous first-teamer in 2022.
A total of 100 sportswriters and broadcasters vote on the All-NBA teams.
First-team votes are worth a total of five points, second-team votes are worth three, and third-team votes are worth one point.

     Jalen Rose voted Kyrie Irving to an All-NBA team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 All-NBA teams were named on Tuesday, with Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant named to the second team, his 10th overall All-NBA selection.
Surprisingly, he wasn’t the only Nets player to receive an All-NBA vote.
The six guards to earn All-NBA honors were Luka Doncic and Devin Booker (first team), Ja Morant and Steph Curry (second team), and Chris Paul and Trae Young (third team).
There’s little doubting that Irving was a dynamic and productive offensive player when available for the Nets this season.
In his 29 games, the Nets posted a losing record of 14-15, which included a losing streak of eight games in which Irving started.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2018, Booker signed a five-year, $158 million extension with the Suns.
Because LaVine did not make an All-NBA Team, he is not eligible for a supermax extension.
LaVine signed a four-year, $78 million contract with the Bulls in 2018, making him an unrestricted free agent this offseason.
The most he can sign with the Bulls is a five-year, $212.3 million contract.
The most he can sign with another team is a four-year, $157.4 million contract.
