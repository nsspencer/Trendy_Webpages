     ‘No Way To Prevent This’: The Onion homepage reflects all recent stories on mass shootings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the country and media networks react to the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas where 21 people – including 19 children – were killed on Tuesday, the satirical news site The Onion has taken a chilling approach.
Typically after a mass shooting occurs in the U.S., the site and social media users will share their infamous headline, "‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens."
In addition to their website, The Onion also posted a Twitter thread of all the times they used the headline referring to a mass shooting, which began in 2014.
Live updates: Texas school rampage victims were inside one classroom; shooter locked the door.
Former managing editor of the site Marnie Shure told Vice in 2017 the headline "really holds up" whenever mass shootings happen.

     Every Time There's A Mass Shooting, The Onion Writes The Same Story. Today, It Featured All 21.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Each time there is a high-profile mass shooting, the satirical website publishes a variation of the exact same story.
Starting with the 2014 attack in Isla Vista, California, that killed six people, the Onion published a piece titled "'No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens."
On Wednesday, the Onion published its 21st variation of the story — this time in response to the murder of 19 elementary school children and two adults in Uvalde, Texas, the previous day.
"If you look, it takes a while — even on the Twitter feed — to scroll through how many times we posted it today," Nackers said.
It takes you probably 30 seconds to scroll through all the articles if you just keep moving.

     Summary: 'The Onion' has republished a grim headline about mass shootings 21 times since 2014Enlarge this image toggle caption Screenshot by NPR Screenshot by NPRThere are a couple of inevitable responses to a mass shooting in America: funerals and fundraisers, prayers from politicians and the resurfacing of one particular article from satirical site The Onion.
"'No Way To Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens" has been republished 21 times in almost exactly eight years.
Its headline has remained the same for every major mass shooting from Isla Vista, Calif., in 2014 to Tuesday's school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.
Jason Roeder, a former writer and editor at The Onion, is credited with creating the original article.
Dave Cullen, a journalist who has covered mass shootings for years and wrote the New York Times bestseller Columbine, told NPR in 2015 that the article "resonates because they totally got it."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas on May 25, 2022, just one day after an 18-year-old opened fire and killed 21 people at the school.
CNN —The Onion is infamous for this headline, posted after almost every mass shooting: “‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says the Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.” After the school shooting in Texas, it covered its homepage.
On Wednesday, the satirical news website posted that story 21 times, filling most of its homepage.
Each article referenced a different shooting, with the most recent incident at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas – where 19 children and two teachers were killed – at the top.
This is totally predictable.”The Onion’s story about the Uvalde shooting ended with the same closing sentence as the other 21 stories about mass shootings: “At press time, residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years were referring to themselves and their situation as ‘helpless.’”

     He Wrote The Onion’s Famous Mass-Shooting Headline. It Still Haunts Him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s the most awful merging of ghastly and monotonous,” former Onion writer Jason Roeder, who wrote the headline and original story, told Rolling Stone on Wednesday.
“There’s often a lot of collaboration involved [in creating an Onion headline], but not on this occasion,” he says.
“I think this one went in as is.” He didn’t imagine that it would have so much such staying power all these years later.
“But I obviously wouldn’t put the shooting headline in that category.
“I worry it’s just another part of the mass shooting ceremony — thought ‘n’ prayers, don’t politicize, #GunControlNow, and so on,” he says.

     After Texas School Shooting, The Onion Posts 21 Stories on Homepage With the Same Headline: ‘“No Way to Prevent This,” Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since 2014, satirical website The Onion has published virtually the same article — each with the same headline, “‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens” — 21 times, each one following a major gun massacre in the United States.
On Wednesday, The Onion posted all 21 of the articles on its homepage, calling stark attention to the unabated epidemic of mass gun killings in the country.
That included the latest installment in the series, following the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that left 19 children and two adults dead at an elementary school.
Over this Memorial Day weekend, the NRA has scheduled a pro-gun convention in Houston — boasting “over 14 acres of guns and gear” — with keynote speakers including Donald Trump, Texas Gov.
Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz, along with a concert lineup set to include Lee Greenwood and Larry Gatlin.
