     Hyundai recalling 239K vehicles over exploding seat belt parts risk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hyundai has recalled 239,000 vehicles nationwide out of concern that certain seat belt pretensioners could explode and send metal fragments throughout the vehicle.
The recall affects certain 2019-2022 Accents, 2021-2023 Elantras and 2021-2022 Elantra hybrids, according to a safety recall report.
The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in the recall report, which affects driver’s and front passenger’s seat belt pretensioners, that occupants could be injured if the explosions send metal fragments throughout the vehicle.
The NHTSA said it notified Hyundai in September that an occupant of a 2021 Hyundai Elantra allegedly suffered a leg injury after the driver’s side seat belt pretensioner exploded.
The NHTSA said owners who had brought in their vehicles for four previous recalls will need to service their cars again.

     Summary: The Korean automaker Hyundai is recalling hundreds of vehicles due to a malfunction related to the seat belt.

The vehicles that have been recalled include the 2019-2022 Hyundai Accents, 2021-2023 Hyundai Elantras, and 2021-2022 Hyundai Elantra HEVs.

     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — Korean automaker Hyundai is recalling 239,000 cars because the seat belt parts can explode and injure vehicle occupants.
