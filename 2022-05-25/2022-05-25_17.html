     Blues Coach: Racist Comments to Nazem Kadri Are ‘in No Way Acceptable’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Avalanche forward Nazem Kadri has dealt with racism over the past few days, as fans have attacked him on social media after his involvement in Blues goalie Jordan Binnington’s injury in Game 3 of their second-round playoff series.
When asked about the threats against Kadri before Game 4, Blues head coach Craig Berube originally declined to comment.
However, before Wednesday’s Game 5, Berube condemned the racist threats towards Kadri and said he wasn’t aware of them when he chose not to comment originally.
“I just want to comment on my ‘no comment’ the other day,” Berube said, via ESPN’s Greg Wyshynski.
However he stood by Kadri when he heard about the racial abuse.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here's what you need to know ahead of Game 5 between the St. Louis Blues and Colorado Avalanche.
Jeff Le-USA TODAY SportsFor the second time in the second round, we have an elimination game on our hands.
The Colorado Avalanche have a 3-1 series lead over St. Louis, coming off a 6-3 win over St. Louis on Monday.
But he can't do it alone, and the Blues need to focus on the big prize -- they did it three years ago and can do it again.
So, for the Avs, just sticking to their game and not falling for St. Louis' traps and attempts to get after Kadri is the path to success.

     Blues Overcome MacKinnon Hat Trick to Keep Series Alive vs. Avs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Robert Thomas had two goals, including the tying tally with 56 seconds left in regulation, for a resilient Blues team.
It’s the latest game-tying goal for the Blues when facing elimination, according to NHL Stats.
The comeback offset a hat trick from Nathan MacKinnon, who looked like he might have just turned in a signature moment with goal No.
The Blues have rallied from a 3-1 deficit to take a playoff series twice in their history — 1999 against Phoenix and 1991 versus Detroit.
Those were the first two goals of the series for MacKinnon, who has seven in the postseason.
