The Steelers interviewed 16 candidates for the position dating to late January and conducted a second round of interviews with six candidates, including internal candidates Khan and Brandon Hunt.
Hunt, the team's pro scouting coordinator, interviewed for the Bills' assistant GM job and a front-office job with the Eagles earlier this spring.
In January, he interviewed for the Raiders' general manager opening, which went to Dave Ziegler.
Pittsburgh is also expected to hire Philadelphia Eagles VP of player personnel Andy Weidl as assistant general manager, per reports.
