    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joe Biden signed an executive order he promised would usher in the “most significant police reform in decades” on Wednesday, the second anniversary of the murder of George Floyd.
In remarks preceding the signing, Biden praised them for their efforts to push for change even as they grieve.
When the ceremony concluded, Biden invited Floyd’s young daughter, Gianna, to sit in his chair and handed her the pen he had used to sign the order.
Three other former officers were convicted in federal court of violating Floyd’s civil rights.
A White House official said the text had been revised and improved based on input from stakeholders but would not say if the document made explicit reference to systemic racism.

     Summary: Wednesday marks the second anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd – a killing that sparked months of protests and impassioned vows from Democratic lawmakers to better protect Black Americans.
"If they [showed] this level of respect to George Floyd for attempting to spend a fake $20 bill, he would be alive."
We all are sick and tired of being sick and tired," Buffalo resident Geo Hernandez said at a recent press conference held by the advocacy organization VOICE.
"Since the death of George Floyd, there have been ups and downs," said Tolu Odunsi, a lecturer of law at the University at Buffalo.
But the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which Biden had endorsed, remains stalled in Congress.

Wednesday evening, about three dozen people gathered in front of the governor's residence in St. Paul to remember Floyd and others killed by law enforcement, including Amir Locke and Jamar Clark.
Back at George Floyd Square, the sign dedication did not start smoothly.

“Today we honor two years since George Floyd was murdered by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement earlier Wednesday.
“Each day since, we have remembered George Floyd’s life and legacy as a friend, father, brother, and loved one.

     WATCH: Biden signs policing order on the 2nd anniversary of George Floyd’s death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday to improve accountability in policing —a meaningful but limited action on the second anniversary of George Floyd’s death that reflected the challenges in addressing racism, excessive use of force and public safety when Congress is deadlocked on stronger measures.
Most of Biden’s order is focused on federal law enforcement agencies — for example, requiring them to review and revise policies on use of force.
When four officers were convicted last year for killing Floyd, Biden urged Congress to pass legislation to reform police by the anniversary of his death.
“Across the United States, there is a deficit of trust between law enforcement and the communities they are sworn to protect – particularly Black and Brown communities,” Booker said.
The research could eventually lay the groundwork for more changes within American law enforcement in the future.

     Summary: “His death brought about change in Washington state and across the world,” said Joseph.
She said her son was pulled over for having expired tabs, but said he got scared and drove off.
After getting in a chase with Joseph-McDade, officers fired at his car when he started driving towards them.
Under the law Joseph supported in 2021, law enforcement officers can no longer chase after someone for having expired tabs.
Joseph thinks lawmakers won’t forget what happened to Floyd, just like she’ll never forget what happened to her son.
