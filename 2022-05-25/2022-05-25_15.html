     Horror Movie ‚ÄòWinnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey‚Äô Turns the Beloved Character into a Slasher Maniac!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Strange things can start to happen when beloved characters slip into the public domain, and upcoming horror movie Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey sure is a testament to that.
The upcoming horror movie ‚Äì which is of course not related to Disney in any way, shape or form ‚Äì turns the anthropomorphic yellow teddy bear into a monstrous murderer.
Rhys Frake-Waterfield directed Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, Dread Central discovered this week, and several first-look images suggest a dark and twisted vision.
No plot details are available at this time, but it looks like the movie centers on a killer wearing a Winnie the Pooh mask.
Amber Doig-Thorne, Maria Taylor, and Danielle Scott star in the horror movie.

     See The Winnie The Pooh Horror Movie That Is Actually Happening
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, a horror film and what looks to be a slasher flick, is a real thing and it‚Äôs on the way.
As Dread Central and others have reported, Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey is an upcoming horror film and yes, it‚Äôs real.
According to Dread Central, Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey will be a horror ‚Äúretelling‚Äù of the story we‚Äôre all more familiar with.
It‚Äôs tempting to assume Frake-Waterfield has gone out of his way to keep the Winnie the Pooh horror movie under the radar in fear of the notoriously litigious Disney.
There‚Äôs no word on when the Winnie the Pooh horror flick will release.

     Winnie the Pooh goes on rampage in slasher horror Blood and Honey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Winnie the Pooh is back, but not how you know him (Picture: IMDB / Jagged Edge Productions)Winnie the Pooh is out for blood as the character stars in a gory new slasher film (no, really).
For horror production company Jagged Edge, this means using the character‚Äôs likeness to create a disturbing slasher movie where Pooh and Piglet team up to, well, murder.
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey is written and directed by Rhys Frake-Waterfield.
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey is still currently filming, with no release date set as of yet.
We also don‚Äôt have a trailer for the film, but by the premise alone it‚Äôs likely Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey will have a ready-made audience waiting eagerly to see what they produce.
