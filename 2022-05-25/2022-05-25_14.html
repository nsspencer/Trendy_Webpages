     Summary: A candlelight vigil to honor George Floyd ‘s memory at the intersection where he died was among the remembrances scheduled for Wednesday’s second anniversary of the Black man’s killing at the hands of Minneapolis police officers.
The intersection of 38th and Chicago streets became known informally as George Floyd Square in the wake of his death, with a large sculpture of a clenched fist as the centerpiece of memorials.
The city planned to unveil a street sign officially dubbing the corner George Perry Floyd Square just ahead of the vigil, with Floyd’s brother Terrence among those attending.
“Today we honor two years since George Floyd was murdered by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement.
“Each day since, we have remembered George Floyd’s life and legacy as a friend, father, brother, and loved one.

     Summary: Joe Biden signed an executive order he promised would usher in the “most significant police reform in decades” on Wednesday, the second anniversary of the murder of George Floyd.
In remarks preceding the signing, Biden praised them for their efforts to push for change even as they grieve.
When the ceremony concluded, Biden invited Floyd’s young daughter, Gianna, to sit in his chair and handed her the pen he had used to sign the order.
Three other former officers were convicted in federal court of violating Floyd’s civil rights.
A White House official said the text had been revised and improved based on input from stakeholders but would not say if the document made explicit reference to systemic racism.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Floyd, aged 46, was being arrested on suspicion of attempting to pass a counterfeit bill at a neighbourhood convenience store.
“For the two-year anniversary, it’s woefully underwhelming and not at all something that befits the memory of George Floyd,” Melina Abdullah, a Black Lives Matter grassroots organiser, told Al Jazeera.
Chauvin pleaded guilty in December 2021 to federal charges of violating Floyd’s civil rights, averting a potential penalty of life in prison if convicted at trial.
Reform measuresPolice reform legislation – titled the “George Floyd Justice in Policing Act” – passed the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives in March 2021 on a largely party-line vote.
“Two years after George Floyd’s murder, police violence is the norm and police killings are on the rise,” the Black Lives Matter foundation said in April when Lyoya was killed.

     WATCH: Biden signs policing order on the 2nd anniversary of George Floyd’s death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday to improve accountability in policing —a meaningful but limited action on the second anniversary of George Floyd’s death that reflected the challenges in addressing racism, excessive use of force and public safety when Congress is deadlocked on stronger measures.
Most of Biden’s order is focused on federal law enforcement agencies — for example, requiring them to review and revise policies on use of force.
When four officers were convicted last year for killing Floyd, Biden urged Congress to pass legislation to reform police by the anniversary of his death.
“Across the United States, there is a deficit of trust between law enforcement and the communities they are sworn to protect – particularly Black and Brown communities,” Booker said.
The research could eventually lay the groundwork for more changes within American law enforcement in the future.

Who was George Floyd as a person?
One of the things that I found surprising was that George Floyd's family history includes a period of great wealth.
Reflecting on the last two years, how do you think George Floyd's life has shaped how we view racism?
But it's a constant struggle and I think that's something that's going to be a part of George Floyd's legacy.

     Summary: Wednesday marks the second anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd – a killing that sparked months of protests and impassioned vows from Democratic lawmakers to better protect Black Americans.
"If they [showed] this level of respect to George Floyd for attempting to spend a fake $20 bill, he would be alive."
We all are sick and tired of being sick and tired," Buffalo resident Geo Hernandez said at a recent press conference held by the advocacy organization VOICE.
"Since the death of George Floyd, there have been ups and downs," said Tolu Odunsi, a lecturer of law at the University at Buffalo.
But the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which Biden had endorsed, remains stalled in Congress.

     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday aimed at reforming policing practices on the second anniversary of the death of George Floyd.
It also restricts the transfer of military equipment to law enforcement agencies and mandates all federal agents wear activated body cameras.
But after the legislation failed to garner bipartisan support, the White House began crafting its own action last year.
President Joe Biden signs an executive order Wednesday in the East Room of the White House.
Under the new executive order, law enforcement will be required to intervene and stop the use of excessive force when they see it and administer medical aid to those who are injured.
