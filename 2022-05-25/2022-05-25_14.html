And there is perhaps no bigger personality than the ultimate sole survivor, Maryanne, who becomes the first Black woman to win Survivor since Vecepia Towery 20 years ago!
He tells Maryanne, Lindsay, and Jonathan at various points that he’d use his idol for them.
By unveiling the idol, Maryanne provides evidence to back up her argument that she set herself up with multiple paths to the final three.
It’s a feel-good ending to a stellar season of Survivor.
