    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (NBC) — Wednesday night brings the season finales of all three of NBC’s “Chicago” dramas.
Possibly the most anticipated one is “Chicago Fire,” where wedding bells are set to ring for one on-screen couple, plus a fan-favorite character makes a return.
“I think the fans will be happy with the wedding and the outcome and hopefully, hopefully, nothing explodes, I dunno,” said Kinney.
“We all rushed him.”And while Casey’s return goes as planned in the episode, not everything does.
The “Chicago Fire” season finale airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. with the finales for “Chicago Med” at 8 p.m. and “Chicago PD” at 10 p.m.
