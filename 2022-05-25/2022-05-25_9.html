Denver’s Jokic and Dallas’ Doncic each received 88 first-team votes and 476 points.
The third team was Karl-Anthony Towns, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Pascal Siakam and LeBron James, who earned his 18th All-NBA selection

     What the 2022 All-NBA team results mean for 6 NBA stars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2021-22 All-NBA teams were announced on Tuesday, and for the most part, the results were exactly what was expected.
Nikola Jokic — the back-to-back MVP this season — made it to the first team alongside Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Devin Booker, and Jayson Tatum.
The second team featured Joel Embiid (positions shouldn’t matter for All-NBA, but I digress) as well as Ja Morant, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and DeMar DeRozan.
Meanwhile, third team consideration was given to Karl-Anthony Towns, LeBron James, Chris Paul, Trae Young, and Pascal Siakam.
But let’s remember: the All-NBA has some contract implications for the players involved (and those who were snubbed).

     How Trae Young's All-NBA Selection Hurts Hawks Free Agency Plans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 23-year-old was recognized for his historic season by being voted All-NBA Third Team.
Young has started in two All-Star Games, but an All-NBA selection is far more prestigious - and lucrative.
In August 2021, the Atlanta Hawks and Young agreed to a five-year, $207 million contract extension which kicks in during the 2022-23 season.
Not only do I believe Young deserves every last penny of the supermax deal, but his play also warranted a First Team All-NBA selection, not third.
The Hawks were floating with the luxury tax before Young's selection and are now roughly $3.8 million over the $149 million threshold.

     Giannis Antetokounmpo Named to 2022 All-NBA First Team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leading the way for the Milwaukee Bucks, as ever, was Giannis Antetokounmpo, and for his trouble he’s garnered 100 out of 100 first-place votes as a forward, making him the only player in the league to be an unanimous first team All-NBA player.
In fact, it is his fourth season in a row pulling off that feat (and sixth season being named to any All-NBA team):Giannis All-NBA First Team votes in the last 4 seasons2018-19: 100/1002019-20: 100/1002020-21: 100/1002021-22: 100/100Best.
That, and the loss of Brook Lopez meant that Antetokounmpo had to trade in his poaching defensive instincts for a true center hard hat.
While Nikola Jokic eventually ran away with MVP voting, for just a split-second it felt like Giannis had turned the conversation his way yet again.
He’s just head and shoulders above most of his peers, even at the very elite top of competition.

     Summary: In 2018, Booker signed a five-year, $158 million extension with the Suns.
Because LaVine did not make an All-NBA Team, he is not eligible for a supermax extension.
LaVine signed a four-year, $78 million contract with the Bulls in 2018, making him an unrestricted free agent this offseason.
The most he can sign with the Bulls is a five-year, $212.3 million contract.
The most he can sign with another team is a four-year, $157.4 million contract.
