     Kenley Jansen retires Freddie Freeman for save in return to Dodger Stadium
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Almost everyone in attendance, however, were out of their seats, standing to get a glimpse of a sight Dodger Stadium had never seen.
But Jansen earned the save against his former Dodgers team anyway, completing the Atlanta Braves’ 3-1 win in fitting fashion — inducing a fly ball from former Braves star Freddie Freeman to end the game.
But in a five-inning, three-run start, Walker Buehler still struggled to capture his normal, dominant form to start the season.
But then in the ninth, they faced what so many of their opponents had for a dozen years, becoming the victims of Jansen’s 186th career save at Dodger Stadium — and first to be completed in the bottom of the ninth.
The Dodgers didn’t immediately indicate the severity of Lux’s injury.
