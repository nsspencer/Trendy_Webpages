     Summary: Atlanta Braves vs Los Angeles Dodgers Prediction and PicksThe Dodgers are the most stacked team on paper and they’ve shown that early this season.
Atlanta seems to still be battling that dreaded World Series hangover, so we’re going to take the Dodgers to cover the spread.
The Dodgers aren’t exactly the team you want to face though when you’re trying to right the ship.
Before this series Freeman had been great (as expected) for the Dodgers, starting his career in Los Angeles going 12-of-37 with three doubles.

     Summary: Two MVPs hit homers for the Dodgers (Freeman and Cody Bellinger), another scored a run (Mookie Betts) and a fourth was the winning pitcher (Clayton Kershaw).

Because Freeman deferred $57 million of his $162 million from the Dodgers, his current value is “only” about $145 million.
Two years ago, Olson hit .195 and struck out 31% of the time, the kind of bottom Freeman never saw in his worst years.
Asked what he told Olson, Freeman said, “I told him he could not be in a better place.
