     Summary: Freeman downplayed the significance of his first homer as a Dodger coming against his former team.
"Yeah, I don't know, I just hit it and I was like 'Oh my gosh please go out,'" Freeman told SportsNet LA after the game.
He and his teammates undoubtedly hope this will be the first of many he hits as a Dodger.
... Braves Country, you know, I'm just looking forward to seeing them in two months, I really am."
Freeman and the Dodgers are off to a scorching start that has lived up to their preseason hype as World Series frontrunners.

     Summary: Atlanta Braves vs Los Angeles Dodgers Prediction and PicksThe Dodgers are the most stacked team on paper and they’ve shown that early this season.
Atlanta seems to still be battling that dreaded World Series hangover, so we’re going to take the Dodgers to cover the spread.
The Dodgers aren’t exactly the team you want to face though when you’re trying to right the ship.
Before this series Freeman had been great (as expected) for the Dodgers, starting his career in Los Angeles going 12-of-37 with three doubles.

     Dodgers First Baseman Freddie Freeman Is Exactly Where He Belongs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two MVPs hit homers for the Dodgers (Freeman and Cody Bellinger), another scored a run (Mookie Betts) and a fourth was the winning pitcher (Clayton Kershaw).
He is off to the greatest start in the history of the Atlanta Braves franchise: a .566 OBP over his first 53 plate appearances.
Because Freeman deferred $57 million of his $162 million from the Dodgers, his current value is “only” about $145 million.
Two years ago, Olson hit .195 and struck out 31% of the time, the kind of bottom Freeman never saw in his worst years.
Asked what he told Olson, Freeman said, “I told him he could not be in a better place.
