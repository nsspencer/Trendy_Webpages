     Johnny Depp, at Libel Trial, Denies Ever Striking ‘Any Woman’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The actor Johnny Depp took the stand on Tuesday in the defamation case he brought against the actress Amber Heard, his former wife, seeking to clear his name from domestic abuse allegations that he said were “not based in any species of truth.”Ms. Heard has accused Mr. Depp in court papers of abusing her repeatedly throughout their relationship, including by slapping her, kicking her, headbutting her and dragging her by her hair.
But Mr. Depp told a seven-person jury sitting in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia that it came as a “complete shock” when she lodged those accusations publicly.
“Never did I myself reach the point of striking Ms. Heard in any way,” the actor testified, “nor have I ever struck any woman in my life.”

     Summary: Johnny Depp in court says he has never struck any woman in his lifeEnlarge this image toggle caption AP APActor Johnny Depp wasted no time after taking the stand in court on Tuesday, saying that "never did I myself reach the point of striking Ms. Heard in any way, nor have I ever struck any woman in my life."
Depp is suing the actress for more than $50 million, saying her claims of domestic abuse have harmed his career and reputation.
"I'm obsessed with the truth so today is my first opportunity that I've been able to speak about this case in full for the first time," Depp told the court.
According to Depp, Heard became "visibly shaken or upset" that he had broken the rules of the routine.
In it, she drew on her own experiences as a survivor of sexual assault and domestic abuse.

     'I am not some maniac': Johnny Depp testifies in defamation trial against Amber Heard

     Summary: Depp told the court Tuesday that he was "obsessed with the truth" and that, although he argued with Heard, he never hit her.
Heard's attorneys pushed back, describing Depp as an alcohol- and substance-dependent abuser who is seeking revenge.
In court filings before the trial, Heard said she hit Depp only in self-defense or in defense of her younger sister, according to The New York Times.
Anderson also testified that Heard, in a session conducted separately from her husband, said Depp hit her and that she showed her bruises.
Heard was granted a protective order in May 2016 after she alleged that Depp hit her in the face with a cellphone.

After denying Heard’s abuse allegations, Depp spoke at length about a childhood in which physical abuse from his mother was “constant.” When he became a father, Depp said, he made sure his children didn’t experience that kind of upbringing.
Heard’s lawyers have said Depp physically and sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions, often in situations where he drank so much he later blacked out.
Depp said Heard’s allegations of his substance abuse have been “grossly embellished” and that there have been no moments where he’s been out of control.
Heard’s lawyers, who have filed their own countersuit against Depp, said nothing in the article libels him.

     Johnny Depp Trial Reveals Sordid Culture of Celebrity Enablers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The latest act in the very public unraveling of Johnny Depp began last week in a courtroom in northern Virginia, pulling back the curtain on the secretive world of celebrity enablers and hangers-on.
But after Depp lost a similar case in London in 2020, his public reputation — and career — are in tatters.
The Depp trial also comes as other A-listers have had their own brushes with ignominy.
In February 2014, Dembrowski texted her brother: “Stop drinking, stop coke, stop pills.” But she struggled to acknowledge his drug problem on the stand.
Depp and Heard lived in a nearby penthouse, and Baruch said that he never witnessed violence between them.
