     Villanova Coach Jay Wright Announces Retirement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Villanova men’s basketball coach Jay Wright is retiring, he announced Wednesday night.
“It’s time for us to enter a new era of Villanova basketball,” Wright wrote in a statement.
In his 21-year tenure at Villanova, Wright won 520 games, went to four Final Fours and won national championships in 2016 and ’18.
Once known as one of the top coaches in the sport without a national title, Wright finally topped that mountain with a buzzer-beating victory over North Carolina in 2016.
Neptune, 37, spent eight years under Wright as an assistant coach, including for both national championships.

     Villanova coach Jay Wright steps down, joining growing number who are walking away from a changing profession
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Right in the middle of the NBA Playoffs, more than two weeks after his 21st season at Villanova ended, and several years before most thought it would happen, Jay Wright announced his retirement Wednesday night.
The one thing every former college basketball coach who becomes an NBA coach says he loves is how it allows him to A) get back to just coaching basketball without all "the other stuff," and B) enjoy an offseason in some form.
Right now, college basketball coaches are constantly dealing with "the other stuff" with no real window to comfortably take even a one-week vacation.
But the truth is that a larger number of great college basketball coaches are probably going to spend the coming years and decades making enough money in their 40s and 50s so that they can leave it all behind at an earlier age than the previously expected-retirement-age for great college basketball coaches.
On some level, it's impossible to not think that's what Jay Wright just did.
