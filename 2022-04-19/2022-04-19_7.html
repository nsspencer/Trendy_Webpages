     The Dark Side of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's American Dream
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For suburban millennials, and their parents, is there any scent that evokes memories quite like A&amp;F’s signature Fierce cologne?
The smell welcomed shoppers into Abercrombie’s stores during the brand’s heyday in the nineties and aughts; employees were rumored to spritz it into the air conditioning system.
By the late ‘90s and 2000s, CEO Mike Jeffries was busy imagining this all-American man as jacked, popular, and white.
Under Jeffries, Abercrombie wasn’t just a popular brand and logo—it created a totally dominant aesthetic with its preppy vision of American high schools and colleges.
It’s almost as if customers expected the brand made for the cool kids to act like the rude, popular high schoolers it dressed.

     White Hot: The Rise &amp; Fall of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch movie review (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At its best, “White Hot: The Rise &amp; Fall of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch” offers a potent mix of nostalgia and schadenfreude.
His mentality about and obsession with image made the company incredibly successful, and also gave it a corrosive popularity.
"White Hot" also loses some edge by becoming a piece of disposable doc filmmaking itself—yes, each talking head is introduced as just initially sitting down, preparing for an interview, one of its more weary tropes.
“White Hot” gets some of its edge by telling us the gross standards for what was considered appropriate (AKA attractive) in their stores.
But there seems to be more to be said about how the youth consumer mentality changed after the late ‘90s, including the way that youth cool is now about individuality.

Fashion, even mall fashion, is about affiliating, an attachment to a group; Abercrombie was unsubtly selling attachment to a privileged, white male culture.
Photographer Bruce Weber had done ad campaigns for Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren, but with Abercrombie &amp; Fitch he found his forte – intensifying the gaze on the male body.

Bobby Blanski, a former model, says with amusement, “They literally made so much money marketing clothes, but advertising them with no clothes on.”Abercrombie &amp; Fitch did survive, but barely.
