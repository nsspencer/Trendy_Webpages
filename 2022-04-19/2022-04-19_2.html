     Dodgers' Freddie Freeman: Hits first homer of 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Freeman went 1-for-3 with a solo home run, two walks and two total runs scored in Monday's 7-4 win over the Braves.
Freeman's first home run as a member of the Dodgers came in dramatic fashion, as he hit the solo blast in his first at-bat against the organization with whom he spent the first 15 years of his professional career.
The superstar first baseman is off to a hot start with his new club, slashing .310/.333/.452 with eight runs, three doubles, a homer and five RBI over 47 plate appearances.

     Reunions for Freddie Freeman, Kenley Jansen to start Dodgers-Braves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Freddie Freeman and Kenley Jansen each spent 12 major league seasons with their first teams, but now find themselves on the other side of the Dodgers vs. Braves rivalry.
Freeman homered and reached base three times in the Dodgers’ win on Monday night.
Jansen didn’t pitch, but both players visited former teammates before the game, which was heavy for both players.
But it was also emotional.”Freeman and the Braves maintain a strong relationship even after the split, says Justin Toscano at the Atlanta Journal-Consitution.
Because allowing him back into baseball’s good graces is putting MLB’s stamp of approval on everything Bauer has done since the allegations came to light.”

     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers stayed scorching hot with their 7-4 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Monday.
The Braves and Dodgers would be an interesting enough series alone, but even more eyes were on it because it was the first time former Brave Freddie Freeman was facing his old team.
So when he homered in his first at-bat against Atlanta, you can only imagine how Freddie Freeman felt.

Although it was overshadowed by Freeman, the Dodgers still honored Jansen with a tribute and he discussed his return to Dodger Stadium.

pic.twitter.com/pps1QUGXFZ — Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) April 19, 2022Later, after the Dodgers had completed a 7-4 victory, Freeman did his best to shoot down the home run's significance.
The first person Freeman saw when he stepped off the elevator was Braves head athletic trainer George Poulis, who proceeded to snap his photo.
The Braves, the team Jansen grew up rooting for in Curacao, came with an offer and needed a quick answer.
The Braves' manager of video operations, Rob Smith, was wearing his World Series ring, and Freeman playfully told him to take it off.

     Summary: Freeman and the Braves’ relationship persists, and it hasn’t taken a hit.
“That the relationship was good,” Freeman said on Monday in the Dodgers’ dugout when asked what he took away from their conversation in March.
It was just good to see him.”The biggest lesson learned as Freeman faces his old team might be this: There is no animosity between Freeman and the Braves.
I’m going to be grateful to him for what he did – for me, for my family, for the organization – forever.
Asked about Anthopoulos getting choked up when discussing moving on from Freeman in a scrum with Braves reporters, Freeman merely said, “I saw (the tears).

     Dodgers First Baseman Freddie Freeman Is Exactly Where He Belongs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two MVPs hit homers for the Dodgers (Freeman and Cody Bellinger), another scored a run (Mookie Betts) and a fourth was the winning pitcher (Clayton Kershaw).
He is off to the greatest start in the history of the Atlanta Braves franchise: a .566 OBP over his first 53 plate appearances.
Because Freeman deferred $57 million of his $162 million from the Dodgers, his current value is “only” about $145 million.
Two years ago, Olson hit .195 and struck out 31% of the time, the kind of bottom Freeman never saw in his worst years.
Asked what he told Olson, Freeman said, “I told him he could not be in a better place.
