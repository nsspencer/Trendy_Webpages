    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hollywood star Julia Roberts, who ruled the romantic comedy scene in the 90s, is returning to the genre after a gap of 20 years with Ticket to Paradise opposite George Clooney.
The Notting Hill star said she avoided the genre for almost two decades because there were no scripts that matched the level of her famous films like Pretty Woman or My Best Friend’s Wedding.
Roberts, 54, told The New York Times that she was not avoiding the genre, it’s just that good scripts did not come her way.
“If I had read something that I thought was that ‘Notting Hill’ level of writing or ‘My Best Friend’s Wedding’ level of madcap fun, I would do it.
Somehow we were both able to do it, and off we went,” Roberts said about returning to the genre.

     Summary: Julia Roberts said she considers herself a homemaker as she explained why she has not starred in any romantic comedy in 20 years until now in a recent interview.
In an interview with The New York Times while promoting her upcoming series Gaslit, the actor was surprised to know that she has not made a romcom in so long.
“I consider myself a homemaker,” The Notting Hill actor responded.
That raises the bar even more because then it's not only ‘Is this material good?’ It's also the math equation of my husband's work schedule and the kids' school schedule and summer vacation.
The couple share 3 kids together including 17-year-old twin sons Phinnaeus and Hazel and 14-year-old son Henry.

"They didn’t exist until this movie that I just did that Ol Parker wrote and directed," Roberts added, referencing "Ticket to Paradise."
Roberts admitted that over these past two decades, there has also been another factor in making her so choosy over scripts.
During her appearance on "The Late Show" Monday night, she and Stephen Colbert talked about long marriages, with Roberts celebrating 20 years and Colbert 28.
"Well, I would like to apologize to my wife for not saying 'kissing,'" Colbert replied.
