     Summary: Jimmy Butler #22 of the Miami Heat looks on after Game Two of the Eastern Conference First Round against the Atlanta Hawks (Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images)Miami Heat Playoffs: Hawks Game 1 Jimmy Butler Is Who We Need See by Kenneth WilsonThe Miami Heat knew that Game 2 wouldn’t be like Game 1 of their opening rounds series against the Atlanta Hawks in the 2022 NBA Playoffs.
Former Miami Heat player and TNT color commentator, Jim Jackson, alluded to it.
The Miami Heat wouldn’t come out to dominate the Hawks like Game 1.
The Miami Heat didn’t win the same way in Game 2 as they did in Game 1.
What got it done in Game 2 was a career night from their best player, Jimmy Butler.

     Coup's Takeaways: Jimmy Butler Has A Game For The Ages As Miami Takes 2-0 Lead Over Atlanta
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first half was messy for both sides, with plenty of free-throws, core players in foul trouble and turnovers to go around.
Zero turnovers.
For as much as the Hawks had zero defensive answers for the HEAT as a team in Game 1, they had nothing to offer Butler alone in Game 2.
A virtuoso performance for the record books, and one that puts Miami up 2-0 in the series with their 115-105 victory.
Atlanta’s lineup adjustment worked, and might work better as the series goes on, it just didn’t work enough tonight.

     Jimmy Butler scores 45 to lead Heat past Hawks for 2-0 lead in first-round playoff series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Miami now holds a commanding 2-0 lead in the first-round playoff series.
The Heat is obviously in a good spot after winning the first two games of the series, and history confirms that.
Miami owns a perfect 17-0 all-time record in playoff series that it has taken a 2-0 series lead in.
The Hawks hung around in a back-and-forth first half that included 13 lead changes and 11 ties, as the Heat entered halftime with just a two-point lead.
The Hawks did not go away quietly, though, despite the Heat extending its lead to 16 with 8:50 play.

     Miami Heat's Jimmy Butler scores 45 in Game 2 win, says he's a 'different player' than he was during torrid Finals run in NBA bubble
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jimmy Butler comes up with clutch buckets on two straight possessions to help seal the Heat's Game 2 win over the Hawks.
"I am a different player now than I was then," Butler said after a personal 7-0 run in the waning minutes of Game 2's fourth quarter increased Miami's lead from three to 10 to secure the victory.
"I just always want to play basketball the right way and do whatever it takes to help this team, this organization win.
We're a different team; I'm a different player."
On Tuesday, Butler also was a different player than in the regular season, when he shot just 23.3% on 3-pointers.
