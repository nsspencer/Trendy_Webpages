    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Listen, Julia Roberts did not want to take such a long break from rom-coms, but writers and producers forced her hand.
While My Best Friend’s Wedding may be one of this writer’s least favorite rom-coms, Roberts is right about the lack of high quality rom-coms over the last two decades.
“If I had read something that I thought was that Notting Hill level of writing or My Best Friend’s Wedding level of madcap fun, I would do it.
Like fellow actors Jennifer Lopez, Sandra Bullock, and Meg Ryan, Roberts became a leading lady of romantic comedies with Pretty Woman, Mystic Pizza, Notting Hill, and My Best Friend’s Wedding.
With three out of four of these names returning to the genre, maybe rom-coms will have a renaissance once more.

     Summary: After starring in some of the best romantic comedies of all time, Julia Roberts took a 20-year hiatus from the genre; she hasn’t headlined her own since 2001’s America’s Sweethearts.
In an interview with The New York Times, Roberts said she’s been biding her time until the right project comes along.
“People sometimes misconstrue the amount of time that’s gone by that I haven’t done a romantic comedy as my not wanting to do one,” she explained.
“Here’s the thing: If I’d thought something was good enough, I would have done it,” she explained.
