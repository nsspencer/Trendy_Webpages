    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rapper Pooh Shiesty is going away for a 5-plus year stretch for a South Florida shootout -- and, considering what he could have gotten, he's actually happy with that number.
Pooh, whose real name is Lontrell Williams, was facing more than 8 years in prison, if prosecutors got their way -- but his attorney, Bradford Cohen, tells TMZ ... the government's calculations were off.
Cohen says they asked for no more than 63 months, which is exactly what the judge gave him.
Pooh was busted for an October shootout involving himself and several other men.
He eventually plead guilty to one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence.
