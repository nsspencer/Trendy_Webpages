     Dirty Dancing's Jennifer Grey says nose job made her ‘lose her career’ overnight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Images via GettyDirty Dancing's Jennifer Grey has opened up about the impact that her nose job had on her identity and her career.
Following her starring role in Dirty Dancing as Frances "Baby" Houseman alongside Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Gray decided to get a rhinoplasty to alter the appearance of her nose.
However, after Jennifer underwent surgery twice, it resulted in her face looking so different that even her fellow film star Michael Douglas failed to recognise her at a premiere.
Image via GettyDuring an interview with PEOPLE Magazine she recalled: "That was the first time I had gone out in public.
She writes: “I spent so much energy trying to figure out what I did wrong, why I was banished from the kingdom.

     Dirty Dancing Star Jennifer Grey Opened Up About Plastic Surgery Regret
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After making her big breakthrough in John Hughes’ high school classic Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Jennifer Grey became a household name thanks to her leading role in Dirty Dancing.
The role won Grey a Golden Globe nomination, and remains her defining role 35 years on.
Post-Dirty Dancing, however, Grey’s subsequent projects didn’t garner the same cult status, and the actor has now spoken out about the regret she feels around the rhinoplasty after the release of Dirty Dancing.
Discussing her soon-to-be-released book with People magazine, Grey opened up about a mean remark that the artist Andy Warhol once made about her nose.
She also revealed that her mother, also an actor, encouraged her to have plastic surgery from a young age.

     Summary: (CNN) As Jennifer Grey promotes her forthcoming memoir, "Out of the Corner," she is speaking out about multiple topics, including her two rhinoplasty surgeries.
I loved that my parents did it [underwent rhinoplasty].
It was her mother, Grey said, who first suggested she get her nose done.
Grey said she and co-star Patrick Swayze were not "a natural match" in real life and that caused some of the tension that fueled their characters in the film.
"I actually just had a thought about Patrick," she said of Swayze, who died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 57 in 2009 .

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of those actresses is Jennifer Grey.
While she was iconic in her ‘80s role in Dirty Dancing, she was unrecognizable to some because of the two nose jobs she had in the early 1990s.
In her upcoming memoir Out of the Corner, Jennifer Grey opens up about how her nose jobs made it hard for her to get work and that even Michael Douglas didn’t recognize her.
After Dirty Dancing’s Jennifer Grey got two nose jobs, she went out in public for the first time by attending a movie premiere.
She must still be memorable if there are fans who continue to be insane enough to reenact the infamous lift scene from Dirty Dancing still!
