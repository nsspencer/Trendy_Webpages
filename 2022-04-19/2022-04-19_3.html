     Julia Roberts reveals why she took 20-year break from rom-coms ahead of comeback with George Clooney
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Julia Roberts has said her 20-year break from rom-coms was not through choice - but because the scripts she was offered did not match those from the 1990s.
The 54-year-old is known for classics of the genre including Notting Hill, Pretty Woman and My Best Friend's Wedding, which saw her star alongside actors including Hugh Grant, Dermot Mulroney and Richard Gere.
It has been 25 years since the release of My Best Friend's Wedding and 23 years since Notting Hill.
Roberts is married to cinematographer, Daniel Moder, and the couple have three children; 17-year-old twins Phinnaeus and Hazel and 14-year-old, Henry.
The couple met on the set of Roberts and Brad Pitt's 2000 film, The Mexican.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hollywood star Julia Roberts, who ruled the romantic comedy scene in the 90s, is returning to the genre after a gap of 20 years with Ticket to Paradise opposite George Clooney.
The Notting Hill star said she avoided the genre for almost two decades because there were no scripts that matched the level of her famous films like Pretty Woman or My Best Friend’s Wedding.
Roberts, 54, told The New York Times that she was not avoiding the genre, it’s just that good scripts did not come her way.
“If I had read something that I thought was that ‘Notting Hill’ level of writing or ‘My Best Friend’s Wedding’ level of madcap fun, I would do it.
Somehow we were both able to do it, and off we went,” Roberts said about returning to the genre.

     Julia Roberts Reveals The Secret To A Successful Marriage In Just 1 Word
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What’s the secret to a successful marriage?
According to Julia Roberts: Kissing.
The “Ticket to Paradise” star, who is celebrating her 20th wedding anniversary with her husband, cinematographer Daniel Moder, was asked to share her secret on “The Late Show” Monday night.
“Well, you would know the answer to that as well,” she told host Stephen Colbert, who has been married to his wife Evelyn McGee-Colbert for 28 years.
For Roberts, it was “kissing” ― a far cry from Colbert’s tip to “apologize.”“Well, I would like to apologize to my wife for not saying ‘kissing,’” Colbert said.
