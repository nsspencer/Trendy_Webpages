     3 sailors who served on USS George Washington die within week; Navy investigating
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three sailors who served on the same aircraft carrier in Virginia have turned up dead within a week, military officials said Tuesday.
A sailor was found unresponsive on board the USS George Washington this past Friday, as the carrier is being overhauled at the Newport News Shipbuilding, Navy Lt. Cmdr.
That unidentified sailor was taken to Riverside Regional Medical Center in Newport News where the service member was pronounced dead.
That follows the cases of two sailors who "were found deceased" on April 9 and 10 in separate incidents, Myers said.
"The Navy is cooperating with NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Service) and local authorities where these incidents have occurred to determine the facts," according to a Navy statement.

     Summary: (Tribune News Service) — Three sailors on the carrier USS George Washington died within the space of a week, the Navy said.
The Navy is withholding the sailor’s name until it can reach next of kin.
They are Petty Officer 3rd Class Mikail Rashawn Sharp, who reported to the Washington in October 2020, and Petty Officer 3rd Class Ann Huffman, who has been on the Washington since May 2019.
“Our thoughts and condolences are with the family, friends, and shipmates of our Sailors,” it added.
The overhaul and refueling of USS George Washington is 94% complete.

     Navy IDs two of three USS George Washington sailors who died in the past 10 days
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Navy on Tuesday identified two of three sailors assigned to the aircraft carrier George Washington who have died in the past 10 days, though few details have been released about what led to their deaths.
Retail Services Specialist 3rd Class Mika’il Rayshawn Sharp was found dead at an off-base location in Hampton, Virginia, on April 9, near where the George Washington is undergoing its mid-life refueling and overhaul work, according to Naval Air Force Atlantic spokesman Cmdr.
George Washington was the sailor’s first assignment out of training.
RELATEDHuffman enlisted in 2018 and joined George Washington the following year.
That means that if George Washington comes out of the yard in December, as Navy officials predict, its overhaul will have taken more than five years.
