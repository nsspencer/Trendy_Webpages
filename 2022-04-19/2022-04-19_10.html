     Why ‘4/20’ is associated with marijuana
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There have been many theories, such as 4/20 being the signal code police use when responding to a call involving people smoking marijuana or that there are 420 cannabinoids produced in the cannabis plant.
Phillip Reagan, a cashier at the store, said the men would gather at 4:20 p.m. every day after school to smoke marijuana and would use the term “4-20” to remind one another of the meeting.
They would indeed meet at a statue on campus every day and later revealed to a reporter at TIME that they were the “inventors” of 4/20.
The band and those associated used the term when referring to activities involving marijuana, helping to popularize it even more.
As of April 2022, 18 states have legalized the recreational use of marijuana.

     Cannabis '420' festival brings scent of freedom - and dollars - to Denver
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In particular, Colorado's capital has become a magnet for enthusiasts, since the western US state became the country's first to vote to legalize recreational cannabis a decade ago.
Green gold and greenbacksSince Colorado green-lighted recreational cannabis, eighteen of the 50 US states, plus the capital Washington, have followed suit.
The veteran activist pointed out that legal cannabis sales last year in Colorado -- a state of fewer than six million people -- reached $2.2 billion.
Lopez, a previous organizer of the festival, was recently ousted by a chain of specialty cannabis stores that have partially rebranded the event.
"Georgia is Bible Belt, so there's no chance you'll ever be able to have the freedom to smoke there."
