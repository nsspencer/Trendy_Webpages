     Shaquille O’Neal Opens Up About His Tough Divorce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On TNT’s Inside The NBA, legendary Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal does not shy away from giving his honest opinions about the league.
During a recent appearance on “The Pivot Podcast” with former NFL players Ryan Clark, Channing Crowder and Fred Taylor, Shaq got open and honest about something much more personal: his divorce from wife Shaunie.
Shaunie and Shaquille were married in 2002 and had four children together: Shareef, Amirah, Shaqir and Me’arah.
They separated in 2007 before reconciling, but Shaunie later filed for divorce in 2009.
Shaunie O’Neal, now 47, is an executive producer of the reality TV series Basketball Wives, Basketball Wives LA, and Baller Wives.
