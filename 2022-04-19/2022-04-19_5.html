     Netflix Stock Plummets. It Lost Subscribers—and Expects to Lose Even More.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Streaming video giant Netflix posted disappointing results for the March quarter, including a net loss of subscribers, and the stock was falling more than 25% in premarket trading Wednesday.
The company (ticker: NFLX) lost 200,000 net subscribers in the quarter.
That left it well short of the company’s forecast for 2.5 million net additions, though the number includes the loss of 700,000 subscribers in Russia where the company has suspended service.
Without that factor, the company would have added 500,000 net new subscribers...

     Netflix stock plunges on first subscriber loss in a decade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix's stock sunk more than 20% in after-hours trading Tuesday after the streaming giant said it lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter — its first subscriber loss in a decade.
Why it matters: Netflix's stock was already down more than 40% year-to-date, in large part due to increased competition and slowed user growth forecasts from Netflix for Q1.
Details: "Our revenue growth has slowed considerably as our results and forecast below show," Netflix said in the opening line of its note to shareholders, blaming its "relatively high household penetration," for creating "revenue growth headwinds."
By the numbers, per CNBC:EPS: $3.53 vs $2.89, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts.
Revenue: $7.78 billion vs $7.93 billion, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts.
