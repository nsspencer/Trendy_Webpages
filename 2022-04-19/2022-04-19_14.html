     Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera one hit away from 3,000
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DETROIT — Miguel Cabrera made a run at history in the Yankees’ 5-3 win over the Tigers on Wednesday night and fell just short.
Miguel Cabrera has 2,999 career hits Getty ImagesNeeding four hits to reach 3,000, Cabrera had singled three times by the time he came up to lead off the bottom of the eighth against Clay Holmes.
The announced crowd of 17,268 at Comerica Park stood and cheered when Cabrera walked to the plate, but Holmes struck him out.
“It was a pretty interesting feeling in the ballpark,’’ said Aaron Boone, a teammate of Cabrera’s with the Marlins in 2007.
I’m glad he didn’t get in that spot, but he’s knocking on the door.”

     Summary: DETROIT -- The 2,997th hit of Miguel Cabrera’s career never left the infield.
Cabrera hit a bouncer to third base in the second inning of Wednesday night’s game against the New York Yankees.
pic.twitter.com/jAXO6fzxDo — Detroit Tigers (@tigers) April 20, 2022Unfortunately, a promising second inning never materialized.
He was thrown out thanks to a nice throw by Yankees right fielder Giancarlo Stanton and an excellent tag by LeMahieu.
A broken bat single on the left side in the sixth inning accounted for his 2,999th hit and put him on the brink of the milestone.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I hope we win,” Cabrera said.
Cabrera, 2-for-11 for his career off Yankees starter Luis Severino entering the night, matched his hit total in two at-bats.
Cabrera’s first hit was a second-inning slow roller to the left side that left third baseman DJ LeMahieu with no play.
The 59.2 mph dribbler off Severino had an expected batting average of .080, tied for the ninth lowest on a Cabrera hit since Statcast began tracking in 2015.
On Victor Reyes’ ensuing RBI single to right, Cabrera tried to take right fielder Giancarlo Stantion by surprise, but was thrown out at third base.

     Summary: DETROIT — Miguel Cabrera had three hits to move one shy of 3,000 in the Detroit Tigers' 5-3 loss to the New York Yankees on Wednesday night at chilly Comerica Park.
With the fans falling eerily silent every time Clay Holmes went into his windup, Cabrera struck out on a 1-2 sinker.
Rizzo hit fourth homer, doubled, drove in two runs and stole a base.
Tigers: RHP Matt Manning (shoulder discomfort) was placed on the 10-day injured list due to the Tigers needing reinforcements after using eight pitchers on Tuesday.
LHP Jordan Montgomery (0-0, 3.24) starts for the Yankees and RHP Michael Pineda makes his Tigers debut against one of his former teams.

Except for enduring the loss, Cabrera seemed to be enjoying the at-bat by at-bat climb toward 3,000 hits.

     Summary: Detroit Tigers designated hitter Miguel Cabrera is one hit away from another historic milestone.
"I didn't hit the ball hard today, and I got three hits," Cabrera said.
With one more hit, Cabrera will become the 33rd player in MLB history to reach 3,000 hits.
And Cabrera, boasting 599 doubles, could soon be one of three players with 500 homers, 3,000 hits and 600 doubles.
The hits from Cabrera weren't entirely wasted Wednesday night, but the Tigers managed only three runs on 11 hits and three walks.
