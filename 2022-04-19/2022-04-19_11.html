     Earth Day’s Wisconsin origins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earth Day was started in part by the efforts of Wisconsin native Gaylord NelsonFirst celebrated nationally in the United States on April 22, Earth Day’s debut demonstration observed 20 million people advocating for environmental awareness.
Earth Day was first conceived by Wisconsin native and former senator and governor Gaylord Nelson.
In Milwaukee during 1970, Earth Day observers nominated substitutions for DDT such as ladybugs, toads and the praying mantis.
After his days as a U.S. politician, he shifted his perspective and became a member of the Wilderness Society.
“Gaylord Nelson is an inspiration to all of us at The Wilderness Society,” JonRoush, president of The Wilderness Society, said.
