     If Verizon Outage in Wyoming Prevents You From Calling 911, You Can Text It
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Verizon outage has left many residents of Casper and beyond without the means to make phone calls.
Natrona County Emergency Management has put out a social media post, stating that if people are experiencing an emergency and are unable to call 9-1-1, they can text their emergency to that same number.
"This is a multi-state outage, and there is currently no estimated time until repair.
"If you're experiencing an emergency and are unable to dial out to 9-1-1, you can text your emergency to 9-1-1.
Telecommunicators will receive the communication on the same console as voice calls and will be able to dispatch the most appropriate first-responder."
