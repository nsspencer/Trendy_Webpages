     Tucker Carlson Calls Taylor Lorenz, Reporter Who Unmasked Libs of Tik Tok Creator, a German Stooge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tucker Carlson on Tuesday night wondered aloud why Taylor Lorenz, the author of a Washington Post story earlier in the day on the popular Twitter account Libs of Tik Tok, isn’t registered as a foreign agent.
In the piece, the reporter makes note of findings from software developer Travis Brown that helped her reveal the account’s creator, Brooklyn-based real estate agent Chaya Raichik.
Specifically, Brown uncovered deleted tweets from the account, including those in which Raichik claimed she attended the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
Brown, Lorenz notes, receives support from the German-based Prototype Fund.
How exactly Lorenz, who used publicly available tweets from Brown to aid her reporting, is working on behalf of the German government, Carlson didn’t explain.

     Washington Post defends Taylor Lorenz reporting after story on ‘Libs of TikTok’ Twitter account
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Washington Post is standing behind the reporting of one of its top columnists after a story published Tuesday sparked pushback from supporters of a popular conservative Twitter account.
Taylor Lorenz wrote a report examining the origins of the viral conservative Twitter account “Libs of TikTok,” whose postings, she noted, “morphed into a social media phenomenon, spreading anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment and shaping public discourse.”The account has been circulated widely in conservative media in recent weeks and has influenced prominent politicians and Republican operatives, her article pointed out.
Critics took issue with how Lorenz went about some of her reporting, including going to the account creator’s home in order to verify their identity.
Some accused Lorenz of “doxxing” the account’s creator, a method used by people online to broadcast the personal information of their enemies in order to encourage harassment.
She has accused one of her previous employers, The New York Times, of not fully supporting her in the face of harassment.

     Summary: Taylor Lorenz, The Washington Post journalist who revealed Chaya Raichik to be the woman behind the Libs of TikTok account, is defending her reporting practices amid an onslaught of online criticisms from conservatives, who have attacked Lorenz for publishing Raichik's name.

The Washington Post is defending a widely criticized article that "exposed" the creator of the viral Twitter account, "Libs of TikTok."
“Taylor Lorenz is an accomplished and diligent journalist whose reporting methods comport entirely with the Washington Post’s professional standards,” Cameron Barr, Senior Managing Editor at the Washington Post said.
The link contained the account owner’s real estate license number, full name and possible address.
A spokesperson for the Washington Post sent the following response:“We linked to publicly available professional information and ultimately deemed it unnecessary.”

     Taylor Lorenz blasted for 'doxxing' 'Libs of TikTok' creator
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Doxxing” is the term used to describe the act of posting the personal information of those who wish to remain anonymous.
The “Libs of TikTok” account, which posts TikTok videos from liberals and has generated more than 662,500 followers, posted an image of Lorenz outside the home of one of her relatives.
MSNBC’s segment detailed how Fox News host Tucker Carlson ripped Lorenz in March 2021 for calling for an end to online harassment.
At the time, Lorenz, then a reporter for the New York Times, said she had endured a “smear campaign” that had “destroyed her life.”The “Libs of TikTok” is a parody account which posts videos of liberals on TikTok.
Researchers at New York University found tweets with harmful language directed at Lorenz spiked 144% after Greenwald posted the tweet.

     Right-Wing Figures Attack Journalist Taylor Lorenz For Revealing Creator Of ‘Libs Of TikTok’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineA host of right-wing figures—including Fox News personality Tucker Carlson—took aim at Washington Post journalist Taylor Lorenz on Tuesday after the reporter uncovered the creator of “Libs of TikTok,” a Twitter account with more than half a million followers that shares anti-LGBTQ+ content and has become influential in conservative media.
The TikTok app is displayed on an iPhone.
Lorenz and Libs of TikTok did not immediately return requests for comment.
Key BackgroundThough Libs of TikTok has been temporarily suspended from Twitter and TikTok for violating community guidelines, the account has garnered more than a half a million followers on Twitter, as well as thousands on Instagram, YouTube and right-wing apps such as GETTR.
Raichik—who reportedly posted election fraud conspiracy theories on a previous Twitter account and suggested she attended the Stop the Steal rally on January 6, 2021—has claimed in the past several teachers have been fired after being shown on the account, Lorenz reported.
