     Avalanche center Nazem Kadri has received threats in St. Louis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ST. LOUIS — Avalanche forward Nazem Kadri has received threats here following his collision with Blues goaltender Jordan Binnington in Saturday’s Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinal series at Enterprise Center.
“The Avalanche organization is aware of threats made toward Nazem Kadri and is working with local law enforcement to investigate,” the club said in a statement.
Naz has been subject to so many racist attacks and threats since last night that police had to be brought in.
Rosen appeared to push Kadri into Binnington and the goalie sustained a lower-body injury that will prevent him from playing again in the series.
Kadri served an eight-game suspension for a check to the head of Blues defenseman Justin Faulk in last year’s playoffs.

     Colorado Avalanche working with law enforcement in St. Louis regarding threats made toward center Nazem Kadri after Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Colorado Avalanche are working with St. Louis law enforcement regarding threats made toward center Nazem Kadri after their Game 3 victory against the Blues Saturday night.
Just six minutes and 45 seconds into the first period of Game 3, Kadri and Blues defenseman Calle Rosen crashed into Binnington.
The Avalanche hold a 2-1 series lead heading into Game 4 on Monday night in St. Louis.
Aliu told ESPN that Kadri felt unsafe at the Avalanche's team hotel in St. Louis, partially due to social media threats.
Aliu also called out the St. Louis coach for making insinuations based on Kadri's reputation.

     New scrutiny for Avs’ Kadri after collision with Binnington
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER (AP) That water bottle tossed toward Colorado Avalanche forward Nazem Kadri hardly came out of nowhere.
For two straight postseasons, Kadri has been the agitator that makes Colorado go and the pest that drives the St. Louis Blues crazy.
Kadri missed the final two games as Colorado swept the Blues and then the entire Vegas series, where Colorado was eliminated in six games.
Kadri led the Avalanche with 59 assists in the regular season and scored 28 goals.
He sort of relishes it.”New scrutiny for Avs’ Kadri after collision with Binnington originally appeared on NBCSports.com
