Photo by Stu Forster/Getty ImagesManchester City have apologised to Robin Olsen after Steven Gerrard claimed the Aston Villa goalkeeper was "attacked" during a pitch invasion at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.
Olsen appeared to be holding his head as he emerged from the crowd after City supporters entered the pitch following their 3-2 win over Villa to clinch the Premier League title.
A statement issued by City on Sunday said: "Manchester City would like to sincerely apologise to Aston Villa goalkeeper Robin Olsen, who was assaulted after the final whistle at today's match when fans entered the pitch.
Olsen was a surprise selection against City after usual first-choice Emi Martinez missed out through injury.

     Summary: The Premier League title is staying in Manchester.
In a title race that came down to the final day of the 2021-22 season, reigning champion Manchester City successfully defended their Premier League crown with an improbable 3-2 comeback win over Aston Villa on Sunday.
Man City entered Championship Sunday holding a one-point advantage in the table and a plus-six edge in goal difference over Liverpool.
But, just when it seemed like Man City were going to suffer an epic Championship Sunday collapse, they flexed their championship pedigree in a major way.
The Sky Blues’ six Premier League championships are second to only Manchester United, who own 13.

     Summary: Manchester City won their fourth Premier League title in five years on Sunday but nearly let the trophy slip from their hands, coming back from two goals down to beat Aston Villa with three goals inside an electrifying five minutes late in the second half.
But that was soon to change as Villa, managed by former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, provided a twist in the storyline.
City were far from their fluent best, lacking finesse as they piled on the pressure in search of a leveller but rarely troubling Villa keeper Robin Olsen.
The edgy mood among the home fans turned to desperation after Philippe Coutinho then doubled the lead for Villa with a goal of pure simplicity.
But then came the City comeback blitz that sealed the title regardless of events at Anfield.
