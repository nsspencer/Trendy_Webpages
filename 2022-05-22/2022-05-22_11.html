    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ARSENAL kept up their side of the bargain but it still wasnâ€™t enough to end their six-year absence from the Champions League.
So it is Thursday nights in the Europa League again for Arsenal as Arteta was left to reflect on what might have been.
It was a full 12 minutes before the visitors even touched the ball inside their opponentsâ€™ half and for the first 20 minutes Arsenal had an astonishing 90 per cent possession.
And Martin Odegaardâ€™s late fifth wrapped up Arsenalâ€™s biggest League win of the season as Everton completely crumbled.

     Summary: And so weâ€™ve reached the end of the season, Arsenal play host to Everton at the Emirates to wrap things up.
Theyâ€™ve gone from totally in control of their Top Four fate to needing a miracle Norwich City win over Tottenham and a win over Everton to finish fourth.
Itâ€™s been a fun season with this bunch, the youngest average starting roster in the Premier League.
Thereâ€™s plenty going on elsewhere in the Premier League as well.
