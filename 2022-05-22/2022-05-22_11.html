     Day 2: Three things to look out for
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fellow champion Krejcikova may have a tough task ahead against France’s Diane Parry, who will enjoy the emphatic support of her home crowd.
Parry will leverage every 'allez' in her quest to upset the 2021 winner, who is competing in her first match since February after being sidelined with an arm injury.
The winner will face Colombian Camila Osorio in the second round.
After that, all eyes will be on Nadal — or rather, Nadal’s left foot — as the 13-time champion steps out on his happiest hunting ground to face Australia’s Jordan Thompson.
But if we’ve learned one thing over the years, it’s this: you can never count out Nadal in Paris.

     Alcaraz v Londero: Things we learned
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 19-year-old has returned to the French capital as the No.6 seed and one of the overwhelming tournament favourites — and he showed why in his 6-4, 6-2, 6-0 victory over lucky loser Juan Ignacio Londero on Court Philippe-Chatrier.
Here’s what we learned from Alcaraz’s first-round victory.
A bit of rust would have been understandable, especially against the battle-tested Londero, who won two matches in qualifying before bowing out to Borna Gojo.
Despite a scratchy start, the Spaniard didn’t panic or lose patience.
He simply applied his game, relying on his strong first serve to jump-start points, using his weight of shot to keep 28-year-old Londero on the move and deep in the court, and peppering the points with smart drop shots and passing shots.

     Summary: 'I need a few more months'Tried and tested methods that have reaped so much success for Thiem in the past will remain as he outlines his vision for the near future.
I think that's the key.
It's time to do the same again to get back on track,” insisted the 28-year-old, who has only been able to practise fully in the last seven weeks.
“Of course a match win would help a lot, but if I'm honest to myself, in all the matches I played, I'm still pretty far away from a win,” he admits.
“I just need to try to find the confidence and the shots back also in tight situations like matches.”

     Summary: All eyes were on Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros, where the 19-year-old Spaniard passed his first test on Sunday with flying colours.
At Roland Garros 12 months ago, Alcaraz was No.
Alcaraz faced an experienced opponent in Londero, who advanced to the fourth round at Roland Garros three years ago on his Grand Slam main draw debut.
In the first set, Londero played with far more aggression than normal to prevent Alcaraz from dominating their baseline exchanges.
Ironically, Alcaraz faces Ramos-Vinolas in his first ATP Tour main draw match two years ago in Rio de Janeiro.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been a long time since Nadal showed up in Paris and this tournament was not his to lose.
Nadal’s winning the French Open was long the closest thing to a foregone conclusion in this sport or any other.
In October 2020, with the pandemic having prompted the French Tennis Federation to move the tournament to early fall from late spring, Nadal stampeded through the competition without dropping a set.
And after just a few weeks of preparation and a single tournament, Nadal won the Australian Open in January, showing the world once more that counting him out is a terrible idea.
But in recent days, the pain has been difficult again, and the top players can sense that the 2022 French Open has a different feel than others in recent memory.
