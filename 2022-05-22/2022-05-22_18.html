     Chelsea vs Watford final score: Blues end season with late win

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea vs Watford: Thomas Tuchel and the Blues wrapped up the 2021-22 Premier League season with a 3rd-place finish and three more points in a 2-1 victory over the Hornets at Stamford Bridge on Championship Sunday.
Chelsea vs Watford final score, stats, resultsFinal score: Chelsea 2, Watford 1Goal scorers: Chelsea (Havertz 11′, Barkley 90’+1), Watford (Gosling 87′)Shots: Chelsea 19, Watford 8Shots on target: Chelsea 8, Watford 3Possession: Chelsea 72%, Watford 28%2 things we learned – Chelsea vs Watford1.
In hindsight, that’s where Chelsea struggled this season, with $135-million man Romelu Lukaku chief among the Blues’ strugglers.
Havertz finished the season much better than he started it, so perhaps one Chelsea attacker will come away with positive feelings toward the 2021-22 season.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea's win didn't change their position in the table.
Barkley, playing his 100th game for Chelsea, headed in a Reece James cross three minutes after Watford's Dan Gosling had equalised for the Hornets.
The result made no change to the Premier League table.
Chelsea, whose £4.25 billion ($5.2bn) ownership deal with a U.S.-led consortium is still awaiting full approval, finished the season in third place.
Chelsea lost both the League Cup and FA Cup finals to Liverpool in the tightest finishes this season with both games going to penalties.

     Summary: Chelsea will officially finish in third place of the Premier League with the European Super Cup and Club World Cup added to the trophy cabinet.
Here is the gambling guide to Chelsea’s Premier League game against WatfordThe Hornets’ relegation was sealed weeks ago and their recent results are certainly those of a side fitted for the Championship.
Give me the Chelsea clean sheet prop and under 3.5 total goals scored, both of which have odds of -135.
I’m going to give it one last shot here.
I’ll back our starlet to score, and at +280 odds, I’m feeling dangerously confident.

     What Cesar Azpilicueta did after Chelsea vs Watford as important transfer decision looms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cesar Azpilicueta may have played his last game for Chelsea after a tremendous 10 years at the club.
In his time as a Chelsea player, the Spaniard has won two Premier League titles, one Champions League, an FA Cup and a league cup.
The defender has been a key player for the Blues again this season, making 45 appearances to help the club win the Super Cup, Club World Cup and secure a top-four finish.
Azpilicueta has operated as a centre-back in a three-man defence and as a right-wing back under Thomas Tuchel.
