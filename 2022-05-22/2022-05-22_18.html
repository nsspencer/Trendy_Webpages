     Jason Kubler: Australia’s third tennis Special K breaks through at French Open
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the light fading in Paris on Sunday night, a one-time prodigy of Australian tennis enjoyed arguably the finest moment of a career that has been sadly restricted by injury.
Well over a decade after matching the junior deeds of 13-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal, Jason Kubler finally broke through for his first ever win at Roland Garros.
He is older than the Australian Open doubles champions, who have also endured more than their fair share of injury and motivation issues, but he too was once considered a likely star.
As a 17-year-old, he debuted in the Australian Open.
In his first Roland Garros appearance since 2017, Kokkinakis fell to Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5).

     Rafael Nadal Is the French Open’s Man of Mystery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been a long time since Nadal showed up in Paris and this tournament was not his to lose.
Nadal’s winning the French Open was long the closest thing to a foregone conclusion in this sport or any other.
In October 2020, with the pandemic having prompted the French Tennis Federation to move the tournament to early fall from late spring, Nadal stampeded through the competition without dropping a set.
And after just a few weeks of preparation and a single tournament, Nadal won the Australian Open in January, showing the world once more that counting him out is a terrible idea.
But in recent days, the pain has been difficult again, and the top players can sense that the 2022 French Open has a different feel than others in recent memory.
