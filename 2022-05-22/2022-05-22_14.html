     HunterGirl Slays With Bruce Springsteen Hit on 'Idol' Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Country singer HunterGirl — real name is Hunter Wolkonowski — took the stage on Sunday night (May 22) in hopes to win America’s hearts one last time as part of the American Idol Season 20 grand finale.
Onstage, she performed a judges' favorite, “Dancing in the Dark,” as part of the episode's tribute to Bruce Springsteen.
Wearing a bejeweled jacket and a matching dress, HunterGirl wailed out the catchy singalong lyrics amid a retro backdrop and accompanied by a full band.
Despite Marlene’s successful first impression, it’s clear HunterGirl made a mark by bringing the energy up a notch.
HunterGirl, who works with veterans who are struggling with PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), received one of the highly sought-after Platinum Tickets this season.
