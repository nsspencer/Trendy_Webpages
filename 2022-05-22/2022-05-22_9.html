     White Sox's Tim Anderson: Scratched from Game 1 lineup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anderson was scratched from the lineup for Game 1 of Sunday's doubleheader against the Yankees for unspecified reasons.
The 28-year-old was penciled in to start at shortstop and bat atop the order, per usual, but he's absent from the revised lineup that was released by the White Sox.
It's unclear whether Anderson is dealing with an injury or if he'll be available for either game of Sunday's twin bill.
Yoan Moncada (leg) will take over the leadoff spot while Leury Garcia starts at shortstop.

     White Sox Call Josh Donaldson’s ‘Jackie’ Comments Racist
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: White Sox Manager Tony La Russa didn’t mince words when he was asked what happened between Yankees third baseman Josh Donaldson and Chicago shortstop Tim Anderson.
Anderson deemed the reference to Jackie Robinson, who broke Major League Baseball’s color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, “disrespectful” before agreeing with his manager that the remark was racist.
“Basically, he was trying to call me Jackie Robinson,” Anderson said.
“He was like, ‘Hey, what’s up Jackie?’ I don’t play like that.
I don’t really play at all.

     Summary: In the aftermath, we learned Donaldson was called out for making a "racist" comment, by White Sox manager Tony La Russa.
Prior to the start of the first game Sunday, White Sox closer Liam Hendriks weighed in and came strong at Donaldson, calling his explanation "complete bullshit."
That was just a completely unacceptable thing and trying to whip it out as being an inside joke, that's horseshit.
It's like having an inside joke with a guy who you are a nemesis with, I guess you could say?
Simply, there are plenty of layers to the beef between Donaldson and the White Sox.

     Boone: Josh Donaldson shouldn't make 'Jackie' remark to Tim Anderson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — Yankees slugger Josh Donaldson was wrong to make a remark referencing Jackie Robinson when speaking to White Sox star Tim Anderson, New York manager Aaron Boone said Sunday.
Boone said he talked to Donaldson after Saturday’s game and believed his player’s explanation for why he said it — but he also said he thought Donaldson shouldn’t have used the term.
Donaldson said he twice called Anderson by “Jackie” — as in Robinson, who famously broke MLB’s color barrier in 1947 — during the Yankees’ 7-5 win.
“Basically, it was trying to call me Jackie Robinson.
The benches also emptied on May 13 after Anderson shoved Donaldson following a hard tag in Chicago.

     Summary: Grandal was standing up for teammate Tim Anderson after Donaldson made a racist remark to him on multiple occasions earlier in the game.
Tim Anderson took offense to Donaldson’s Jackie Robinson comment to him.
Josh Donaldson says he called Tim Anderson “Jackie” during today’s game, referencing a quote from Anderson in a 2019 story.
Josh Donaldson said that in the past, and and Tim Anderson had joked about it.
The very simple problem with Josh Donaldson calling Tim Anderson “Jackie” is that he perverted honor into mockery.
