    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Jurassic Park" stars Laura Dern and Sam Neill's 20-year age gap in the 1993 blockbuster never raised eyebrows to them until recently.
The 10 must-see movies of 2022:'Jurassic World Dominion' to 'Top Gun: Maverick'Dern also discussed being 20 years junior to Neill.
"Our age gap in 'Jurassic Park' was completely inappropriate," she said, looking at it through today's lens.
At the time, she said, she thought it was "completely appropriate to fall in love with Sam Neill."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Neill was 20 years older than Laura Dern in "Jurassic Park," an age gap that somehow didn't make the stars uncomfortable until nearly three decades after the 1993 blockbuster hit theaters.
“Laura was a tender age," Neill told The Sunday Times of London via BuzzFeed News of the casting.
Now, much to the delight of fans, they're reprising their roles in "Jurassic World Dominion."
Dern told the London news outlet that the 20 year age gap was "completely inappropriate," but at the time, she thought it was "completely appropriate to fall in love with Sam Neill."
They've already wrapped shooting "Jurassic World Dominion."

     Laura Dern Questions Whether ‘Jurassic Park’ Age Gap Romance Was ‘Completely Appropriate’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Neill started to question their onscreen romance when he saw it featured in a magazine article titled "Old Geezers and Gals."
Laura Dern was 26 years old when “Jurassic Park” hit theaters in 1993, but she was only 23 when the movie began shooting.
Her character, Dr. Ellie Sattler, falls in love with the much older scientist Dr. Alan Grant, played by Sam Neill.
Neill was 43 years old during the shoot, but neither actor was particularly concerned about the 20 year age gap between their characters.
“Well, it felt completely appropriate to fall in love with Sam Neill,” Dern said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Laura Dern has said that she never considered the age gap between herself and Sam Neill in Jurassic Park to be inappropriate until recent years.
In a new interview with The Sunday Times, Neill noted that Dern was a “tender age” when they shot the film.
Dern, however, said that at the time “it felt completely appropriate to fall in love with Sam Neill”.
Discussing his own experience of the age gap, Neill said: “I am 20 years older than Laura!
It can’t be true.’”Dern and Neill are reprising their Jurassic Park roles in Jurassic World Dominion, which is released on 10 June.

     Jurassic Park Stars Laura Dern And Sam Neill Open Up About Hollywood Standards And That Huge Romantic Age Gap (Good Thing They Break Up By The Third Movie)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of course, one thing viewers are more than likely aware of is the significant age gap between the actors who play them, Sam Neill and Laura Dern.
While reflecting on Jurassic Park, Sam Neill explained that the 20-year gap between himself and Laura Dern didn’t really hit him until a write-up caught his eye:I am 20 years older than Laura!
Alan didn’t seem ready to settle down but, also, the age gap between the two stars themselves could’ve become more evident as time moved on, making things somewhat awkward.
All of that aside, it’s going to be great to see Laura Dern and Sam Neill’s characters return for Jurassic World: Dominion.
I’m not sure if moviegoers will be focusing so much on the age gap while watching, given everything else that’ll be happening in the jam-packed film.
