     Arsenal 5 Everton 1: Gunners romp to huge win but miss out on Champions League to Tottenham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ARSENAL kept up their side of the bargain but it still wasn’t enough to end their six-year absence from the Champions League.
So it is Thursday nights in the Europa League again for Arsenal as Arteta was left to reflect on what might have been.
It was a full 12 minutes before the visitors even touched the ball inside their opponents’ half and for the first 20 minutes Arsenal had an astonishing 90 per cent possession.
And Martin Odegaard’s late fifth wrapped up Arsenal’s biggest League win of the season as Everton completely crumbled.

Gabriel got Arsenal's fourth when a Cedric shot was blocked and he nabbed the rebound and smashed it past Begovic.
Odegaard was given too much space by the Everton defence for Arsenal's third and slammed the ball into the net.
