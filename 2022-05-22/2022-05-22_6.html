     5 things to know about 2022 PGA Championship hopeful Cameron Young
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Young showed promise from an early age, becoming the youngest winner of the Carter Cup in 2011 as well as Metropolitan Golf Association Junior champion.
Young had the grades to go to Stanford but chose Wake Forest, where he received the Lanny Wadkins Scholarship.
“It’s because of the PGA that (my father’s) had the job he had for the last many years.
I started playing in PGA junior events when I was nine, eight, something like that,” Cameron Young said.
So to kind of have the chance to go from local PGA junior tournaments, national PGA juniors to Junior Ryder Cup, to even play in a PGA Championship is really cool for me.
