     Summary: 'I need a few more months'Tried and tested methods that have reaped so much success for Thiem in the past will remain as he outlines his vision for the near future.
I think that's the key.
It's time to do the same again to get back on track,” insisted the 28-year-old, who has only been able to practise fully in the last seven weeks.
“Of course a match win would help a lot, but if I'm honest to myself, in all the matches I played, I'm still pretty far away from a win,” he admits.
“I just need to try to find the confidence and the shots back also in tight situations like matches.”

     Rafael Nadal Is the French Open’s Man of Mystery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been a long time since Nadal showed up in Paris and this tournament was not his to lose.
Nadal’s winning the French Open was long the closest thing to a foregone conclusion in this sport or any other.
In October 2020, with the pandemic having prompted the French Tennis Federation to move the tournament to early fall from late spring, Nadal stampeded through the competition without dropping a set.
And after just a few weeks of preparation and a single tournament, Nadal won the Australian Open in January, showing the world once more that counting him out is a terrible idea.
But in recent days, the pain has been difficult again, and the top players can sense that the 2022 French Open has a different feel than others in recent memory.

     Jabeur, Thiem crash at French Open as Alcaraz starts Roland Garros bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arab trailblazer Ons Jabeur crashed out of the French Open at the first hurdle on Sunday as Spanish teenage sensation Carlos Alcaraz prepared to give Roland Garros a glimpse of the future of Grand Slam tennis.
Linette had lost to Jabeur in the third round in 2021 having stunned an injury-hit top seed Ashleigh Barty in her previous match.
Thiem, the 2020 US Open champion, has yet to win a match in six attempts since his return in March.
Later Sunday, Alcaraz begins his French Open campaign against Argentine lucky loser Juan Ignacio Londero, ranked at 141 but who made the last 16 in 2019.
Sakkari was a semi-finalist at the French Open in 2021 where she was defeated in three sets by eventual champion Barbora Krejcikova.
