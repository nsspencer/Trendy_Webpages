     Laura Dern is 20 years younger than Sam Neill in Jurassic Park
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Neill was 20 years older than Laura Dern in "Jurassic Park," an age gap that somehow didn't make the stars uncomfortable until nearly three decades after the 1993 blockbuster hit theaters.
“Laura was a tender age," Neill told The Sunday Times of London via BuzzFeed News of the casting.
Now, much to the delight of fans, they're reprising their roles in "Jurassic World Dominion."
Dern told the London news outlet that the 20 year age gap was "completely inappropriate," but at the time, she thought it was "completely appropriate to fall in love with Sam Neill."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

     Laura Dern Questions Whether ‘Jurassic Park’ Age Gap Romance Was ‘Completely Appropriate’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Neill started to question their onscreen romance when he saw it featured in a magazine article titled "Old Geezers and Gals."
Laura Dern was 26 years old when “Jurassic Park” hit theaters in 1993, but she was only 23 when the movie began shooting.
Her character, Dr. Ellie Sattler, falls in love with the much older scientist Dr. Alan Grant, played by Sam Neill.
Neill was 43 years old during the shoot, but neither actor was particularly concerned about the 20 year age gap between their characters.
“Well, it felt completely appropriate to fall in love with Sam Neill,” Dern said.
