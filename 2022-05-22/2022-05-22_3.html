     Liverpool Suffer Huge Double Injury Blow Ahead Of Champions League Final Against Real Madrid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool have suffered a potential huge double injury blow ahead of the UEFA Champions League final against Real Madrid next Saturday.
Jurgen Klopp's team finished just one point behind City but as focus switches to the Champions League final, the German has two injury concerns.
Just before half-time, Thiago Alcantara, who had created the equaliser for Sadio Mane walked off after picking up a hamstring injury.
Whilst the injury doesn't look serious, recovery from a muscle injury like that in just six days is unlikely and it must cast a huge doubt over his availability.
Divock Origi was missing from the Reds squad that faced Wolves after it was revealed he had also picked up a muscle injury.

     Liverpool agonizingly misses out on the Premier League title despite beating Wolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) It was so close and yet so far for Liverpool.
As Manchester City trailed 2-0 at home to Aston Villa with just 15 minutes to go, Liverpool knew that -- barring a miracle at the Etihad Stadium -- a win over Wolves would secure a 20th league title for the Merseyside team.
Unfortunately for the Reds, so did that miracle over in Manchester.
So the historic quadruple chase is finally over and also the hope of securing the domestic treble, though it should be remembered that Liverpool never actually held top spot during Sunday's dramatic conclusion to the Premier League season.
Pipped to the crown by Manchester City by a single point for the second time in three seasons, goals from Sadio Mane, Andy Robertson, and Mohamed Salah ensured Liverpool held up their side of the bargain and pushed their Premier League title rival to the wire once again.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool have confirmed Fulham’s attacking midfielder Fábio Carvalho will join them on 1 July but are sweating on Thiago Alcântara’s fitness for Saturday’s Champions League final against Real Madrid.
Nineteen-year-old Carvalho is expected to sign a five-year contract with the Anfield club and will cost £5m plus add-ons.
A Liverpool statement said: “Liverpool FC can confirm Fábio Carvalho will join the club this summer.
“An exciting talent born in the Lisbon region of Portugal, Carvalho made his debut for Portugal Under-21s in March of this year having previously represented England at youth level.
Thiago sustained an achilles injury during Liverpool’s Premier League win against Wolves on Sunday and faces a fight to be fit for Saturday’s Champions League final against Real Madrid.

     Double Liverpool snub proves Pep Guardiola completely wrong as Mohamed Salah robbed once again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sign up to receive the best LFC opinion direct to your inboxIn 2017/18, Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah scored 44 goals and provided 16 assists.
And while Pep Guardiola won't want to hear it, there has very clearly been another robbery — in fact, there have been two.
But it was only a fortnight ago that Guardiola claimed “everyone in this country supports Liverpool, the media and everyone”.
Only twice in Premier League history has a player led both tables outright — Andy Cole in 1993/94 and Harry Kane in 2020/21.
It’s also worth noting that De Bruyne was Premier League Player of the Season in 2019/20 despite Liverpool’s glaring supremacy, while Foden has now won Young Player of the Season back-to-back.

     Summary: Then word coming through that City had kicked off again, that the goal stood, that this might actually be happening.
That season Liverpool won the Champions League and, although the quadruple has again proved elusive, that prize perhaps awaits next weekend.
The possibility that Steven Gerrard might at last win the title for Liverpool had been teased almost to breaking point.
Could this also be Benítez securing a league title for what has always felt like his one true club?
Gerrard coming close but not quite close enough in the league is itself a well-worn trope: this, in fact, does usually slip.

Liverpool beat Wolves but didn't do enough to win the Premier League.
However, by that time City had completed their own comeback 3-2 win over Villa, meaning they retained the title and Liverpool finished the season as runners-up.
Wolves finished 10th on 51 points.

Liverpool went to the end against Wolves, and in that respect it summed up the season.
With no control over the Manchester City result, this was all they could do in their quest for the title.
For a long time, it looked as though Manchester City would slip up, only for Liverpool to fail to capitalise.

     Summary: LIVERPOOL, England -- There are always what-ifs when a team gets so close to glory.
Had Liverpool scored, the Etihad may have emptied even further and drained all hope of a late fightback.
When the final whistle blew on Liverpool's 2021-22 Premier League season on Sunday, it was a case of what might have been.
Over the last four years, Liverpool have won one title and finished runners-up behind City twice -- with 92 points this season and 97 in 2018-19.
It will be Liverpool's third Champions League final in five seasons and they can win a second European Cup in that time -- and seventh overall -- by winning in the Stade de France.
