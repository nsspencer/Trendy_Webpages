     Rafael Nadal Is the French Open’s Man of Mystery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In October 2020, with the pandemic having prompted the French Tennis Federation to move the tournament to early fall from late spring, Nadal stampeded through the competition without dropping a set.
For months during the fall, Nadal wondered whether he would ever play again.
And after just a few weeks of preparation and a single tournament, Nadal won the Australian Open in January, showing the world once more that counting him out is a terrible idea.
But in recent days, the pain has been difficult again, and the top players can sense that the 2022 French Open has a different feel than others in recent memory.
But he prefaced those comments with a reference to Nadal, someone he jokingly described as having won the French Open “at least 28 times.” That is how large his presence looms on these grounds.

     Dominic Thiem and Ons Jabeur slip to first-round defeats in French Open
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For four consecutive years, between 2016 and 2019, Thiem marched deep into the French Open draw and inched closer to the title each time.
Just two hours into the tournament on Sunday afternoon, Thiem suffered a disappointing and at times hard to watch first-round defeat to Hugo Dellien of Bolivia, who easily beat him 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.
Since returning from a nine-month injury layoff due to a right wrist injury and various complications, Thiem has now lost all of his seven matches back, winning just two sets between them.
The clearest issue for Thiem is his forehand, the focal point of his game and the stroke naturally most affected by the right wrist injury.
“I’m a pretty positive person, to be honest with you, I’m not going to let a match like this ruin it,” said Jabeur.

     Summary: PARIS (Reuters) – The first Grand Slam tournament without any COVID-19 restrictions since the pandemic started in early 2020 kicked off under menacing skies at Roland Garros on Sunday.
The French Open was the first major to be hit by the pandemic when it was postponed two years ago but all safety measures were lifted for this tournament, giving the fortnight a welcome sense of normality again.
The French Open is the only of the four majors to start on a Sunday.
The Serbian is bidding to match 13-times French Open champion Rafael Nadal’s men’s record of 21 Grand Slam titles and the two are on a quarter-final collision course.
Iga Swiatek, the hot favourite in the women’s draw, is scheduled to play her first match on Monday or Tuesday.
