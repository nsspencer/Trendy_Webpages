     Fast start fizzles for Blues in 5-2 loss to Avalanche in Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the Blues didn’t get their wish, despite a fast start in front of the hometown fans.
The Avalanche won 5-2 for a 2-1 series lead.
Blues goaltender Jordan Binnington recently won back his starting gig in the playoffs.
If the Blues recall a goaltender from the Springfield Thunderbirds, I believe that’d be their best bet.
The Blues host the Avalanche again on Monday night for Game 4 at 8:30 pm Central.

     Blues goalie Jordan Binnington ruled out for rest of Avalanche series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: St. Louis Blues goalie Jordan Binnington will be sidelined for the remainder of the team's second-round playoff series against the Colorado Avalanche after exiting Game 3 on Saturday, head coach Craig Berube said Sunday.
Binnington, 28, left the game after being hit by Colorado forward Nazem Kadri, who was driving to the net, as well as Blues defenseman Calle Rosen.
"Look at Kadri’s reputation, that’s all I’ve got to say," Berube said, citing Kadri's past suspensions in the playoffs.
Blues backup goalie Ville Husso took over after the injury and remained in net for the remainder of the game.
The Avalanche have a 2-1 series lead after defeating the Blues 5-2 in Game 3.

     Blues dealt worrying injury update on Jordan Binnington
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The St. Louis Blues were dealt a tough defeat on their home ice against the Colorado Avalanche in Game 3 on Saturday.
The loss was made worse by the injury sustained by starting goaltender Jordan Binnington early in the game.
After a collision with Nazem Kadri, Binnington was unable to continue due to an apparent knee injury.
According to Jeremy Rutherford, the Blues are worried that Binnington suffered a knee sprain which would keep him out of the lineup for at least a few weeks.
Nothing definitive, but hearing from good sources that the Blues' fear tonight is they could lose Jordan Binnington for multiple weeks with a possible knee sprain.

     Binnington out for the series after Kadri collision, Blues recall Lindgren
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: St. Louis Blues goaltender Jordan Binnington will be sidelined for the rest of the team's second-round series against the Colorado Avalanche, coach Craig Berube said Sunday.
The Blues recalled goaltender Charlie Lindgren from the AHL's Springfield Thunderbirds on Sunday under emergency conditions.
Binner is a heart and soul (player), playing unbelievable," Blues captain Ryan O'Reilly told reporters afterward.
"I think it was Binnington, but I was kind of a little tied up, so you'll have to ask him," Kadri told reporters afterward.
The 28-year-old from Lakeville, Minn., joined St. Louis this year after spending the past five seasons with the Montreal Canadiens.

     St. Louis Blues Recall Charlie Lindgren
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With starter Jordan Binnington out for the foreseeable future, the St. Louis Blues have made a move to solidify their backup goalie position behind new starter Ville Husso.
The Blues announced today that Charlie Lindgren has been recalled from the AHL’s Springfield Thunderbirds on an emergency basis.
While St. Louis would undoubtedly prefer to have Binnington healthy, there are few teams that can boast the goaltending depth that the Blues’ organization has.
His work in the AHL, a 24-7-1 record and a .925 save percentage, has been superb.
His brief time in the NHL has also gone extremely well, and he has a .958 save percentage and a 1.22 goals-against-average in five games played.
