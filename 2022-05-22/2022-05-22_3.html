     Dellien delivers the goods to deal with Thiem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thiem, working has way back from a wrist injury sustained last June, remains without a tour victory since Rome 12 months ago.
World No.87 Dellien advanced to his joint-best Grand Slam showing to take on either Portuguese qualifier Nuno Borges or 21st seed Karen Khachanov.
Story of the matchThere was a warm applause for former world No.3 Thiem, the crowd eager for the Austrian to regain his confidence and footing on the terre battue.
An early break point presented a warning sign, Thiem striking a brace of inside-in forehand winners to fend off trouble.
Thiem wasn’t assured in his shot choice or connections.

     Rafael Nadal Is the French Open’s Man of Mystery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In October 2020, with the pandemic having prompted the French Tennis Federation to move the tournament to early fall from late spring, Nadal stampeded through the competition without dropping a set.
For months during the fall, Nadal wondered whether he would ever play again.
And after just a few weeks of preparation and a single tournament, Nadal won the Australian Open in January, showing the world once more that counting him out is a terrible idea.
But in recent days, the pain has been difficult again, and the top players can sense that the 2022 French Open has a different feel than others in recent memory.
But he prefaced those comments with a reference to Nadal, someone he jokingly described as having won the French Open “at least 28 times.” That is how large his presence looms on these grounds.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arab trailblazer Ons Jabeur crashed out of the French Open at the first hurdle on Sunday as Spanish teenage sensation Carlos Alcaraz prepared to give Roland Garros a glimpse of the future of Grand Slam tennis.
Linette had lost to Jabeur in the third round in 2021 having stunned an injury-hit top seed Ashleigh Barty in her previous match.
Thiem, the 2020 US Open champion, has yet to win a match in six attempts since his return in March.
Later Sunday, Alcaraz begins his French Open campaign against Argentine lucky loser Juan Ignacio Londero, ranked at 141 but who made the last 16 in 2019.
Sakkari was a semi-finalist at the French Open in 2021 where she was defeated in three sets by eventual champion Barbora Krejcikova.
