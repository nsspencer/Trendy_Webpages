     Summary: But Jared Bednar said today that he might put Ryan Murray or Kurtis MacDermid in there instead.
So, we’ll have to wait and see who’s in for Game 4 tomorrow night here.
For me, Johnson brings the best of all elements not only to replace Girard, but for how Game 4 might be played.
He played 74 games for the Avs in the regular season and he played very well.
He played very well and greatly contributed to a team that had the best record in the Western Conference.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (AP) – Despite regaining the edge in their second-round series, the Colorado Avalanche aren’t satisfied.
Artturi Lehkonen scored twice, Darcy Kuemper stopped 29 shots and the Avalanche beat the St. Louis Blues 5-2 in Game 3 on Saturday night to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.
“I think there was a little bit of a momentum swing there,” O’Connor said about the Blues changing goaltenders.
Lehkonen scored his third of the playoffs to put Colorado up 3-1 with 2:45 remaining in the second period.
Lehkonen scored his second of the night with Husso pulled to put Colorado up 5-2 in the final minute.

     Blues goalie Jordan Binnington out for series against Avalanche as teams debate Nazem Kadri’s culpability in play that produced injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ST. LOUIS — Blues coach Craig Berube on Sunday said goalie Jordan Binnington will miss the rest of the series against the Avalanche with a lower-body injury — believed to be to his right knee.
And all anyone wanted to talk about in the immediate aftermath was whether the play that produced that injury — Avs forward Nazem Kadri and Blues defenseman Calle Rosen’s collision with Binnington 6:45 into the first period — crossed a line.
But Blues forward Brayden Schenn and defenseman Robert Bortuzzo said Sunday that Kadri — who has a history of suspensions in the playoffs — initiated contact with Binnington.
Nazem Kadri thinks Jordan Binnington threw a water battle at him during TNT postgame interview #Avs pic.twitter.com/pEV9nwlxF0 — Mike Chambers (@MikeChambers) May 22, 2022“I just see a loose puck, really,” Kadri said.
It’s a loose puck.

     Summary: The severity of the injury was announced postgame and after Girard was taken to a local hospital for further evaluation.
Johnson, a 35-year-old with 1,024-career regular season games under his belt, dressed in 30 regular season games for the Avalanche.
Murray, 28, played in 37 regular season games, but hasn't played since March 21 after sustaining an upper-body injury which he has now recovered from.
MacDermid, 28, suited up in 58 games for the Avalanche during the regular season.
During the regular season, the team utilized their depth and "next man up" mentality all season long as injuries continuously plagued them.
