     F1 set to group races by region in 2023 calendar reshuffle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Listen to this articleThe strategy was revealed by F1 boss Stefano Domenicali during his regular Saturday “coffee morning” meeting with team principals in Barcelona.
The sport has been hit not just by rising prices but increasingly scarce availability of freight capacity.
While some races have traditionally been grouped together, there are anomalies in the calendar in the way some flyaway races are placed.
This season Miami was a standalone race involving a North American trip for just one race weekend, while the upcoming races in Baku and Montreal are back-to-backs but obviously far apart geographically.
The Middle Eastern races could also be paired, with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia together at the start of the year, and Qatar and Abu Dhabi towards the end.

Charles Leclerc leads the Spanish Grand Prix ahead of Max Verstappen before the Ferrari driver was forced to retire.
Russell vying brilliantly with Verstappen, and Hamilton coming through the field would have been unthinkable with the car that opened the season.
“With Lewis we had probably the fastest race car today,” he said.
Verstappen and Red Bull, however, stuck at their task and delivered an adaptive strategy to secure an impressive victory.
