     Thiago’s injury “not good” as Jurgen Klopp provides cautious update
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jurgen Klopp‘s initial assessment of Thiago‘s injury against Wolves was “not good” and Liverpool will be nervously awaiting scan results days out from the European Cup final.
With a Champions League final just six days away, any injury on the final day of the Premier League season would leave a serious race against time.
Thiago is one of the first names on the team sheet but with Paris looming large, his involvement is under serious doubt as Klopp offered his initial take on the lower leg injury.
“Not good, but I cannot say more,” Klopp told reporters.
The manager did also confirm that Divock Origi is “definitely out for the final” due to a muscle injury sustained prior to the visit of Wolves.

The manner of the outcome means Liverpool will undoubtedly feel deflated, as the quadruple dream finally died in late May.
It’s the hope that kills youRemarkably, Liverpool were never actually ahead on a frantic final day.
The best tonic for this disappointment will be a win in the Champions League final, just as in 2019.
Thiago is a phenomenon“Fight with your life, hermano.”Those were the words of Thiago when he was substituted off for Corentin Tolisso in the Champions League final back in 2020.
