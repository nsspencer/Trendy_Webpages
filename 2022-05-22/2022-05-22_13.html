     Rafael Nadal Is the French Open’s Man of Mystery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been a long time since Nadal showed up in Paris and this tournament was not his to lose.
Nadal’s winning the French Open was long the closest thing to a foregone conclusion in this sport or any other.
In October 2020, with the pandemic having prompted the French Tennis Federation to move the tournament to early fall from late spring, Nadal stampeded through the competition without dropping a set.
And after just a few weeks of preparation and a single tournament, Nadal won the Australian Open in January, showing the world once more that counting him out is a terrible idea.
But in recent days, the pain has been difficult again, and the top players can sense that the 2022 French Open has a different feel than others in recent memory.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadPARIS — The French Open got underway Sunday, dodging passing showers and, for the most part, controversy that marred the Australian Open and threatens to embroil Wimbledon.
AdvertisementIn a sharp rebuke to what they viewed as discrimination, the men’s and women’s pro tours announced Friday that they would withhold ranking points from all Wimbledon competitors this year.
AdvertisementThough Wimbledon doesn’t begin until June 27, the issues of access and ranking points hung in the air Sunday at Roland Garros.
She voiced empathy for players such as 2021 Wimbledon finalist Karolina Pliskova, who won’t be able to benefit from those points.
I’d rather try to take it week by week and not really think about if Wimbledon will be less appealing.”GiftOutline Gift Article
