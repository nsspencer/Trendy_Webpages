     Ryan Blaney wins NASCAR All-Star Race -- but inadvertent mistake almost costs him $1 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In its 38-year history, the NASCAR All-Star Race has been an event where we’ve seen experimentation with rules (and some of which have ultimately gone on to be implemented in the future in regular points-paying events).
But Sunday night at Texas Motor Speedway, we witnessed one of the strangest outcomes to not just any All-Star Race that’s ever been held, but ANY NASCAR race for that matter.
But because the All-Star Race rules are different than points-paying race rules, the race had to finish under green-flag conditions.
And that’s when the All-Star Race rules nuance almost cost Blaney the $1 million prize.
And to add insult to injury – and again, doing it without really thinking and almost in automatic fashion – Blaney pulled down his window net.

As he tried to get off the racing surface, a fast-approaching Ross Chastain ran over the back of the No.
We had a really fast race car, a great race car.

Blaney attempted to put his window net back up, but fastening and securing the window net is not easily done from the driver's seat.
As a result, Blaney was only able to get his window net put back up in a haphazard and loose fashion.
As for the no-call on Blaney's window net, Miller cited circumstantial evidence that Blaney's window net may have been adequately fastened.
