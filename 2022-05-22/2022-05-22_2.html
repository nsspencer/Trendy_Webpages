     F1 set to group races by region in 2023 calendar reshuffle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Listen to this articleThe strategy was revealed by F1 boss Stefano Domenicali during his regular Saturday “coffee morning” meeting with team principals in Barcelona.
The sport has been hit not just by rising prices but increasingly scarce availability of freight capacity.
While some races have traditionally been grouped together, there are anomalies in the calendar in the way some flyaway races are placed.
This season Miami was a standalone race involving a North American trip for just one race weekend, while the upcoming races in Baku and Montreal are back-to-backs but obviously far apart geographically.
The Middle Eastern races could also be paired, with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia together at the start of the year, and Qatar and Abu Dhabi towards the end.

     Verstappen: DRS issues made Red Bull change F1 strategy to win Spanish GP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Verstappen's charge was further complicated by an issue with his DRS actuator, which had also ruined his final run in Saturday qualifying.
Due to a combination of the intermittent DRS issue and Russell's robust defending, Verstappen and Red Bull decided to change strategy and go for a bold three-stopper, with an extra stint on used softs to try and regain track position.
Verstappen's strategy allowed him to win the race, albeit after Red Bull asking team-mate Sergio Perez to cede the lead in the final stint.
"I suddenly had a lot of tail wind, so I just lost the rear and went off," Verstappen explained.
Thanks to his win, which includes a bonus point for the fastest lap, Verstappen takes over the lead of the 2022 championship for the first time.

     Leclerc "can't afford" more F1 DNFs after Spanish GP exit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The issue proved terminal, as Leclerc coasted into the pitlane into an early retirement.
Ferrari soon confirmed that an undiagnosed power unit issue was the cause of his early exit.
I had no indications before and it just broke and I lost the power completely, so it's a shame," Leclerc told Sky Sports.
Instead, his retirement opened the door for Verstappen to win the race, and also net the Dutchman a championship lead for the first time in 2022.
Leclerc said he wasn't too concerned about the prospect of losing hold of the points lead but acknowledged he could not afford many more DNFs like Spain.

So the power unit will be [sent] back to Maranello, travelling during the night, and we will disassemble it tomorrow morning."
After two events where Ferrari had been caught out by worse tyre wear than Red Bull, Leclerc reckoned that things were very different this time around and the team had everything under control.
Asked if he felt without the failure he would have gone on for a straightforward win, he said: "With the laps I had done, honestly, everything was going really, really well.

     Summary: Meanwhile, the now-former leader in the driver standings, Charles Leclerc, held the lead up until lap 27 when he lost power, forcing him to retire.
But Pérez said after the race: “I’m happy for the team, but we need to speak later.”Here’s three takeaways from the Spanish Grand Prix.
Red Bull arguably made some questionable decisions with their drivers, electing to prioritize Verstappen over Pérez.
Although the Red Bull drivers made their way past the young rising star, he held on to score his second podium this season.
Red Bull leads the Constructor standings with 195 points compared to Ferrari’s 169.

Charles Leclerc leads the Spanish Grand Prix ahead of Max Verstappen before the Ferrari driver was forced to retire.
Russell vying brilliantly with Verstappen, and Hamilton coming through the field would have been unthinkable with the car that opened the season.
“With Lewis we had probably the fastest race car today,” he said.
Verstappen and Red Bull, however, stuck at their task and delivered an adaptive strategy to secure an impressive victory.
