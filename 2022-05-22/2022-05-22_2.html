     Summary: The Portuguese forward has started 30 of United’s 37 Premier League games this season, but misses out on this final fixture due to a hip flexor injury.
Speaking to club media pre-match at Selhurst Park in south London, Rangnick discussed his team selection for this 2021/22 Premier League finale.
Alongside Ronaldo, Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Dean Henderson and Luke Shaw are not in the 20-man squad.
“Yes, they are all not available due to injuries so we have some players missing today,” he said.

     Erik Ten Hag Watches Manchester United Live Against Crystal Palace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Erik ten Hag was at Selhurst Park to watch Manchester United's final game of their worst season in Premier League history.
The Dutchman will be in charge of United next season after signing a three-year contract to take over as manager.
There was no Cristiano Ronaldo for Ten Hag to watch, after the 37-year-old picked up a knock earlier in the week.
United's dismal season ended with their 12 defeat in 38 Premier League games.
United will therefore be in the Europa League next season, while the Hammers will play Europa Conference League ball.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has told his teammates to consider seeking a move away if they are not fully committed to the Premier League club.
De Gea, 31, was speaking after United’s 1-0 loss to Crystal Palace on the final day of the season.
Fortunately for Manchester United, however, West Ham’s loss to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion ensured that United finish in sixth and qualify for the Europa League.
Addressing his teammates, De Gea said: “Ones who want to stay, stay at the club.
Tottenham Hotspur qualified for the Champions League after a 5-0 win at Norwich, while Leeds United’s victory against Brentford saw them stay up at Burnley’s expense.

     Summary: Manchester United will not be in the Champions League in 2022-23 after failing to qualify via the Premier League this season.
Throughout the year, Manchester United was plagued by inconsistency and spells with minimal production from key players.
With 59 points on the season, Manchester United will finish in sixth place and is bound for the Europa League once again.
Without further ado, it’s time to identify the three culprits most responsible for Manchester United’s disappointing season in 2021-22.

     Summary: Meanwhile, Patrick Vieira, whose exciting Crystal Palace team have exceeded many expectations, appearing unruffled by his Goodison Park dustup, was hailed by the home fans after a season of progress.
“There’s a really strong relationship between you and the players,” Vieira told Palace fans in a post-match address that followed a first home Premier League win over United.
Erik ten Hag (centre), who will take over as Manchester United manager this summer, watches from the stands.

As Zaha celebrated, Ten Hag, doubtless aware the TV cameras were on him, was stone-faced though at half-time was happy enough to pose for selfies with Palace fans.
