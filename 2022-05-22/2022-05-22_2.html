"Out of our starting XI, there will be 10, apart from Edi Cavani, who will still be playing for this club next season.
"I presume they’d much rather play in the Europa League than the Conference League."

     Summary: The Portuguese forward has started 30 of United’s 37 Premier League games this season, but misses out on this final fixture due to a hip flexor injury.
Speaking to club media pre-match at Selhurst Park in south London, Rangnick discussed his team selection for this 2021/22 Premier League finale.
Alongside Ronaldo, Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Dean Henderson and Luke Shaw are not in the 20-man squad.
“Yes, they are all not available due to injuries so we have some players missing today,” he said.

     Summary: Erik ten Hag was at Selhurst Park to watch Manchester United's final game of their worst season in Premier League history.
The Dutchman will be in charge of United next season after signing a three-year contract to take over as manager.
There was no Cristiano Ronaldo for Ten Hag to watch, after the 37-year-old picked up a knock earlier in the week.
United's dismal season ended with their 12 defeat in 38 Premier League games.
United will therefore be in the Europa League next season, while the Hammers will play Europa Conference League ball.

     Summary: Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has told his teammates to consider seeking a move away if they are not fully committed to the Premier League club.
De Gea, 31, was speaking after United’s 1-0 loss to Crystal Palace on the final day of the season.
Fortunately for Manchester United, however, West Ham’s loss to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion ensured that United finish in sixth and qualify for the Europa League.
Addressing his teammates, De Gea said: “Ones who want to stay, stay at the club.
Tottenham Hotspur qualified for the Champions League after a 5-0 win at Norwich, while Leeds United’s victory against Brentford saw them stay up at Burnley’s expense.

“There’s a really strong relationship between you and the players,” Vieira told Palace fans in a post-match address that followed a first home Premier League win over United.
