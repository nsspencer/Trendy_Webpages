     WATCH: Will Zalatoris avoid catastrophe with remarkable up-and-down off cart path in 2022 PGA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TULSA, Okla. – The bunkers have caused some problems for players this week at Southern Hills, as has the thick Bermuda rough, but what about the concrete?
When Will Zalatoris went long of the par-3 sixth green in Sunday’s final round and nearly ended up on 61st St. in Tulsa, he decided the best option was to take an unplayable and drop on the cart path.
His ball proceeded to settle into a groove on the cart path, but it was still the best option for Zalatoris, who was tied for the lead at the time of his tee shot.
What could’ve been a disaster for the Wake Forest product turned into an incredible bogey and perhaps the up-and-down of the week, after he pitched it off the concrete and onto the green before sinking the 8-footer to walk off with a four.
A win today would be Zalatoris’ first major championship and his first win on the PGA Tour.

     PGA Championship 2022: How Will Zalatoris handled a wild rules situation for an all-time crazy bogey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At this point Zalatoris was now entitled to free relief from the tower, which is deemed a temporary immovable obstruction (TIO) using the procedures under Rule 16.
Once again he was able to move his ball, this time one clublength from where the TIO came into play (to define a relief area that was clear of the obstruction).
Then he got another clublength from that area to make his drop.
This, too, would result in the ball being dropped on the cart path.
Zalatoris proceeded to go through two drops, the second of which bounced on the cart path and eventually fell into a seam on the path.

     Justin Thomas wins PGA Championship in playoff against Will Zalatoris
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And not when he faced a seven-shot deficit entering Sunday’s final 18 holes at Southern Hills Country Club.
With help from Mito Pereira’s heartbreaking debacle on the 72nd hole, Thomas won the PGA Championship and his second Wanamaker Trophy in a three-hole aggregate playoff against Will Zalatoris, who was seeking his first PGA Tour title.
“Obviously sad to be here and not in the playoff,” Pereira said.
Woods shot his worst score – a 9-over-par 79 – in his PGA Championship career.
Woods clearly labored through the round and the second round, his right foot, ankle and leg that was severely damaged during a single-car rollover accident 15 months ago causing him pain.

    </h2>

     Summary: Justin Thomas gets the two-putt on the final playoff hole against Will Zalatoris to win the PGA Championship.
"I was asked early in the week what lead is safe, and I said, 'No lead,''' Thomas said.
The 19 straight majors without a playoff was the longest streak in major championship history.
Retief Goosen won the other in the 2001 U.S. Open after he three-putted from 12 feet on the final hole.
Thomas closed at 14-1 to win the PGA Championship at Caesars Sportsbook.

     Summary: Will Zalatoris just made the best, most confusing bogey save ever at the PGAShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailThings got very weird for Will Zalatoris on the par-3 6th at Southern Hills.
CBSIt took close to 20 minutes for Will Zalatoris to unravel the most miraculous bogey of the 2022 PGA Championship.
The situation began when Zalatoris, then eight under and tied for the tournament lead, knocked his tee shot through the green on the par-3 6th.
Zalatoris’ ball boomeranged harder than a freeway exit, fluttering right of the green, off the TV tower, and even right of the fans rimming the hole.
So, after all that chaos, Zalatoris faced a choice: Hit his approach from the cart path, or from right next to the bush.

     Justin Thomas Wins PGA Championship in Playoff Over Will Zalatoris
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just in time, Thomas won the PGA for a second time with a Sunday charge while a war of attrition broke out around him at Southern Hills.
Orlando Ramirez/USA TodayTULSA, Okla.—The 104th PGA Championship can be summed up in five words: Justin Thomas, just in time.
After Thomas somehow won his second PGA Championship, besting Will Zalatoris in a playoff, his visage holding the Wanamaker Trophy was already displayed on the big electronic scoreboard by the 18th green as the awards ceremony concluded there.
In the playoff, Zalatoris left his approach on the 18th green’s lower level so Thomas was sure par was going to be good enough.
The way he won this PGA Championship, with a remarkable comeback, is one that will stand the test of time.
