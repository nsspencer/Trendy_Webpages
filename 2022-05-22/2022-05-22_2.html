     Justin Thomas Wins the P.G.A. Championship With a Roaring Comeback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Championship revolved around Phil Mickelson, who became the oldest major champion last year when he won the event at age 50 but chose not to defend his title.
In a taut, three-hole aggregate playoff after the 18-hole fourth round ended in a tie, Justin Thomas, 29, held off the 25-year-old rising star Will Zalatoris to win his second P.G.A.
Championship.
The last four winners of golf’s major championships, Thomas; Scottie Scheffler, at the Masters; Collin Morikawa, at the British Open; and Jon Rahm, the reigning U.S. Open champion, are in their 20s.
Even in defeat, Zalatoris briefly laughed as he assessed how his generation had become dominant so quickly.

     Summary: Sure, he believed in Thomas, and he believed in his decision to team up with the 29-year-old who now owns 15 PGA Tour titles.
“Because I really like him … and I think he's got more shots than anybody on the tour,” Mackay said.
“I'm not saying, you know, he's, you know, this or that.
I'm saying in his arsenal of shots, he's got more shots than anybody I've seen out here currently—high, low left, right ... whatever.
Hands around the green, the guy's really, really good.

     Justin Thomas wins PGA Championship in playoff against Will Zalatoris
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And not when he faced a seven-shot deficit entering Sunday’s final 18 holes at Southern Hills Country Club.
With help from Mito Pereira’s heartbreaking debacle on the 72nd hole, Thomas won the PGA Championship and his second Wanamaker Trophy in a three-hole aggregate playoff against Will Zalatoris, who was seeking his first PGA Tour title.
“Obviously sad to be here and not in the playoff,” Pereira said.
Woods shot his worst score – a 9-over-par 79 – in his PGA Championship career.
Woods clearly labored through the round and the second round, his right foot, ankle and leg that was severely damaged during a single-car rollover accident 15 months ago causing him pain.

     Justin Thomas wins US PGA title in playoff after Pereira’s late implosion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unfortunately Mito Pereira’s painful implosion will prove more memorable than victory for Justin Thomas.
A terrific drive to within 40ft of the pin at the par-four 17th, the second playoff hole, was key to victory.
This marks Fleetwood’s finest major finish since the 2019 Open.
“The Masters this year was my best finish that I’ve ever had in a Masters; this is the best finish I’ve ever had at the PGA,” Fleetwood said.
Hopes were raised of a famous McIlroy victory as he produced birdies at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th.
