     Thiago Alcantara Injury Latest: Liverpool Manager Jurgen Klopp Gives Worrying Update Ahead Of Champions League Final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has given a worrying injury update on midfielder Thiago Alcantara after his team just missed out on the title at Anfield on Sunday.
Just before half-time, Thiago, who had created the equaliser for Sadio Mane with a sensational backheel left the pitch after picking up a hamstring injury.
Speaking after the game Klopp gave a worrying update for Liverpool supporters who will be desperate for the diminutive playmaker to be fit for the final.
Should Thiago miss the final in Paris, it will be a huge blow to Klopp and Liverpool as he has been hugely influential over the past few months and they would have benefited from his experience against a wily Real Madrid team.

     Liverpool's Thiago likely out for Champions League final with injury - Jurgen Klopp
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thiago sustained a hamstring injury vs. Wolves in the Premier League on Sunday.
Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesMidfielder Thiago Alcantara is facing a battle to be fit for Liverpool's Champions League final against Real Madrid after manager Jurgen Klopp said a hamstring injury sustained by the midfielder against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday is "not good."
Fabinho (hamstring) and Virgil van Dijk (muscular strain) both missed the Wolves game, while forward Divock Origi has been ruled out of the Champions League final with a muscle injury suffered in training this week.
But while admitting that Thiago's injury is a concern, Klopp did not rule the Spain international out of the Madrid clash.
"Div is out [of the Champions League final]," Klopp said.

     Liverpool agonizingly misses out on the Premier League title despite beating Wolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) It was so close and yet so far for Liverpool.
As Manchester City trailed 2-0 at home to Aston Villa with just 15 minutes to go, Liverpool knew that -- barring a miracle at the Etihad Stadium -- a win over Wolves would secure a 20th league title for the Merseyside team.
Unfortunately for the Reds, so did that miracle over in Manchester.
So the historic quadruple chase is finally over and also the hope of securing the domestic treble, though it should be remembered that Liverpool never actually held top spot during Sunday's dramatic conclusion to the Premier League season.
Pipped to the crown by Manchester City by a single point for the second time in three seasons, goals from Sadio Mane, Andy Robertson, and Mohamed Salah ensured Liverpool held up their side of the bargain and pushed their Premier League title rival to the wire once again.

     Summary: Liverpool came from a goal down to beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-1 on Sunday, but it was not enough to earn them their second Premier League title, as they finished second, one point behind champions Manchester City who beat Aston Villa 3-2.
Jurgen Klopp's men also have a Champions League final against Real Madrid to look forward to next weekend.
Liverpool beat Wolves but didn't do enough to win the Premier League.
However, by that time City had completed their own comeback 3-2 win over Villa, meaning they retained the title and Liverpool finished the season as runners-up.
Wolves finished 10th on 51 points.

Before the final whistle, many at Anfield thought their old hero Steven Gerrard would help Liverpool win the title.

Liverpool went to the end against Wolves, and in that respect it summed up the season.
With no control over the Manchester City result, this was all they could do in their quest for the title.
For a long time, it looked as though Manchester City would slip up, only for Liverpool to fail to capitalise.

     Summary: Then word coming through that City had kicked off again, that the goal stood, that this might actually be happening.
That season Liverpool won the Champions League and, although the quadruple has again proved elusive, that prize perhaps awaits next weekend.
The possibility that Steven Gerrard might at last win the title for Liverpool had been teased almost to breaking point.
Could this also be Benítez securing a league title for what has always felt like his one true club?
Gerrard coming close but not quite close enough in the league is itself a well-worn trope: this, in fact, does usually slip.
