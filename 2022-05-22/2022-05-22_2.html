     WATCH: Will Zalatoris avoids catastrophe with remarkable up-and-down off cart path in 2022 PGA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TULSA, Okla. – The bunkers have caused some problems for players this week at Southern Hills, as has the thick Bermuda rough, but what about the concrete?
When Will Zalatoris went long of the par-3 sixth green in Sunday’s final round and nearly ended up on 61st St. in Tulsa, he decided the best option was to take an unplayable and drop on the cart path.
His ball proceeded to settle into a groove on the cart path, but it was still the best option for Zalatoris, who was tied for the lead at the time of his tee shot.
What could’ve been a disaster for the Wake Forest product turned into an incredible bogey and perhaps the up-and-down of the week, after he pitched it off the concrete and onto the green before sinking the 8-footer to walk off with a four.
A win today would be Zalatoris’ first major championship and his first win on the PGA Tour.

     PGA Championship 2022: How Will Zalatoris handled a wild rules situation for an all-time crazy bogey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At this point Zalatoris was now entitled to free relief from the tower, which is deemed a temporary immovable obstruction (TIO) using the procedures under Rule 16.
Once again he was able to move his ball, this time one clublength from where the TIO came into play (to define a relief area that was clear of the obstruction).
Then he got another clublength from that area to make his drop.
This, too, would result in the ball being dropped on the cart path.
Zalatoris proceeded to go through two drops, the second of which bounced on the cart path and eventually fell into a seam on the path.

     Summary: Will Zalatoris just made the best, most confusing bogey save ever at the PGAShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailThings got very weird for Will Zalatoris on the par-3 6th at Southern Hills.
CBSIt took close to 20 minutes for Will Zalatoris to unravel the most miraculous bogey of the 2022 PGA Championship.
The situation began when Zalatoris, then eight under and tied for the tournament lead, knocked his tee shot through the green on the par-3 6th.
Zalatoris’ ball boomeranged harder than a freeway exit, fluttering right of the green, off the TV tower, and even right of the fans rimming the hole.
So, after all that chaos, Zalatoris faced a choice: Hit his approach from the cart path, or from right next to the bush.
