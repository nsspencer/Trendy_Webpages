     Ross Chastain Almost Flips After Slamming Into Kyle Busch in All-Star Race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During Sunday’s All-Star Race, disaster was barely avoided after a scary three-vehicle collision occurred.
Kyle Busch’s right rear tired appeared to blow during the race and he was hit from behind by Ross Chastain.
Chastain’s car drove over Busch’s vehicle and nearly flipped over, but it was somehow able to land on its tires.
After landing, Chastain couldn’t maintain control and hit Chase Elliott as a result.
On Saturday, Busch and his team qualified for the top pole position for Sunday’s All-Star Race where the competition combined driver and pit crew skills.

     Busch, Elliott, Larson Crash Out of NASCAR All-Star Race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By STEPHEN HAWKINS, AP Sports WriterFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Former NASCAR All-Star winners Kyle Busch, Chase Elliott and Kyle Larson crashed out in the second stage of this year's race Sunday night at Texas.
The All-Star race followed a concert by country music superstar Blake Shelton in the infield after the 16-car open race to help complete the field for the main event.
Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Texas native James Buescher and Daniel Suarez drove their way into the All-Star race earlier Sunday in an open qualifying.
Texas is the fourth track to host the annual exhibition, but only the second where the All-Star race has been multiple times.
The inaugural All-Star race was held in Charlotte in 1985, with Atlanta hosting in 1985 before 33 in a row in Charlotte.

     Summary: * Kyle Larson is the defending winner of the event, and the only driver to win the All-Star race at Texas Motor Speedway.
This is his second All-Star Race start but the speed he’s shown this year has the entire Cup Series garage taking notice.
One of the most exciting parts of the All-Star race is the fact that every driver is a proven competitor in the Cup Series.
The All-Star race does not follow the standard three-stage format that fans are accustomed to.
For the sake of simplicity, here’s what fans needs to know going into Sunday’s race:* The race is shorter than a typical Cup Series race at 125 laps/187.5 miles.
