    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Jurassic Park" stars Laura Dern and Sam Neill's 20-year age gap in the 1993 blockbuster never raised eyebrows to them until recently.
The 10 must-see movies of 2022:'Jurassic World Dominion' to 'Top Gun: Maverick'Dern also discussed being 20 years junior to Neill.
"Our age gap in 'Jurassic Park' was completely inappropriate," she said, looking at it through today's lens.
At the time, she said, she thought it was "completely appropriate to fall in love with Sam Neill."
"Jurassic World Dominion" is out June 9.

     Laura Dern is 20 years younger than Sam Neill in Jurassic Park
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Neill was 20 years older than Laura Dern in "Jurassic Park," an age gap that somehow didn't make the stars uncomfortable until nearly three decades after the 1993 blockbuster hit theaters.
‚ÄúLaura was a tender age," Neill told The Sunday Times of London via BuzzFeed News of the casting.
Now, much to the delight of fans, they're reprising their roles in "Jurassic World Dominion."
Dern told the London news outlet that the 20 year age gap was "completely inappropriate," but at the time, she thought it was "completely appropriate to fall in love with Sam Neill."
They've already wrapped shooting "Jurassic World Dominion."

     Laura Dern Questions Whether ‚ÄòJurassic Park‚Äô Age Gap Romance Was ‚ÄòCompletely Appropriate‚Äô
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Neill started to question their onscreen romance when he saw it featured in a magazine article titled "Old Geezers and Gals."
Laura Dern was 26 years old when ‚ÄúJurassic Park‚Äù hit theaters in 1993, but she was only 23 when the movie began shooting.
Her character, Dr. Ellie Sattler, falls in love with the much older scientist Dr. Alan Grant, played by Sam Neill.
Neill was 43 years old during the shoot, but neither actor was particularly concerned about the 20 year age gap between their characters.
‚ÄúWell, it felt completely appropriate to fall in love with Sam Neill,‚Äù Dern said.
