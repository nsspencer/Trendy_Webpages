Odegaard was given too much space by the Everton defence for Arsenal's third and slammed the ball into the net.

Theyâ€™ve gone from totally in control of their Top Four fate to needing a miracle Norwich City win over Tottenham and a win over Everton to finish fourth.
Itâ€™s been a fun season with this bunch, the youngest average starting roster in the Premier League.

     Arsenal 5-1 Everton LIVE! Odegaard goal - Premier League result, match stream and latest updates today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A rsenal vs Everton - LIVE!
Arsenal made light work of Everton in a 5-1 victory at Emirates Stadium yet still had to resign themselves to playing Europa League football next season after Tottenham powered past Norwich.
Gabriel Martinelli, Eddie Nketiah, Cedric Soares, Gabriel Magalhaes and Martin Odegaard were on target but the result became incidental as Spurs secured fourth place in the Premier League by storming Carrow Road with a 5-0 win.
Painful defeats to Tottenham and Newcastle had left Arsenal needing a final-day collapse from their north London rivals to have a chance of qualifying for the Champions League but none materialised.
It means Arsenal finish the season in fifth and secure a return to European football, but itâ€™s not in the competition that had been eyeing up just ten days ago.
