     Yankees’ pitching coach surprisingly ejected vs. White Sox
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — More like pitching a fit coach.
Mild-mannered Yankees pitching coach Matt Blake was thrown out in the third inning of the second game of Sunday’s doubleheader with the White Sox at Yankee Stadium.
Blake appeared to have yelled something from the dugout that bothered plate umpire Greg Gibson, who’s also the crew chief.
The umpires convened for a moment, and then Boone talked again with Gibson before Gibson threw out Blake.
The Yankees lost the first game of the doubleheader, 3-1.

     Summary: A long, hot day for baseball concludes with the Yankees and White Sox wrapping up their doubleheader on ESPN’s Sunday night game.
The Yankees lost the matinee today but can still take the series with a win tonight, which would clinch their 10th series victory in a row.
Luis Severino starts, coming off a great start against the Baltimore Orioles, when he allowed only one run on one hit over six innings, with seven strikeouts.
Recently returned from the paternity list, his last start was also against the Yankees, on May 15th.
He earned the loss despite only giving up one hit over six innings, as he walked four batters.
