     From '#PioliOut' to 'Pioli is on fire': How AC Milan manager Stefano Pioli won hearts, minds and a Scudetto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As AC Milan lift the Serie A trophy, the impact of their head coach, Stefano Pioli, cannot be understated.
He was appointed in October 2019 after the club decided to sack Marco Giampaolo, and the fans "welcomed" Pioli with distrust.
AC Milan fans were hoping for something different, after experiencing the failure of Giampaolo and watching Inter Milan appoint Conte only q few months before they wanted a splash.
Though, things didn't go well at the start of his AC Milan journey.
Overall, it was a perfect mix between Maldini and Pioli that built this project which ended up winning the Scudetto eleven years after the last time.
