     Rafael Nadal Is the French Open’s Man of Mystery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been a long time since Nadal showed up in Paris and this tournament was not his to lose.
Nadal’s winning the French Open was long the closest thing to a foregone conclusion in this sport or any other.
In October 2020, with the pandemic having prompted the French Tennis Federation to move the tournament to early fall from late spring, Nadal stampeded through the competition without dropping a set.
And after just a few weeks of preparation and a single tournament, Nadal won the Australian Open in January, showing the world once more that counting him out is a terrible idea.
But in recent days, the pain has been difficult again, and the top players can sense that the 2022 French Open has a different feel than others in recent memory.
