    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the 4th quarter of Golden State's Game 3 victory, Andrew Wiggins threw down the dunk of the playoffs.
Putting Luka Doncic on a poster, Wiggins made an incredibly athletic play above the rim that the refs tried to take away.
Wiggins and his team were able to celebrate only momentarily, as official Marc Davis ran over to call the play an offensive foul on Wiggins.
When asked specifically about official Marc Davis initially ruling the play an offensive foul, Wiggins said, "I feel that dunk would still be alive [if it remained an offensive foul]."

     Summary: Andrew Wiggins had his first 20-10 playoff performance, and he might have been the best player on the floor for both sides.
The veteran forward missed the second half of the Warriors' Game 5 loss last round to the Memphis Grizzlies with right foot soreness and was ruled out for their Game 6 win.

     Warriors: Wiggins' dunk will forever change his reputation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One play might get all the shine, but the highlight does, indeed, highlight the other aspects of Wiggins’ game.
“He’s got a couple of posters this [postseason],” Warriors forward Draymond Green said after the game.
Wiggins has played downright outstanding basketball for the Warriors in stretches since he was traded to Golden State in 2020, but that reputation would not go away.
Of course, there was constant improvement and refinement of Wiggins’ game amid the peaks and valleys.
He had to go just as high Sunday night to show the world that he has become an outstanding, winning NBA player.

     Summary: (0:58)DALLAS -- — Stephen Curry shimmied for the TV crew, Andrew Wiggins shook Luka Doncic with a posterizing dunk and the Warriors are thinking sweep.
“I love the position we’re in,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said.
Doncic scored 21 points in the fourth quarter as the Mavericks tried desperately to close the gap, but fell to 2-6 in his three playoff seasons when the 23-year-old, three-time All-Star scores at least 40 points.
Curry ran the length of the court with his tongue hanging out after Dallas called timeout.
The Warriors extended their NBA record with a 26th consecutive series in which they won at least one road game.
