     In appreciation of Steph Curry having Warriors one win from NBA Finals return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS -- Steph Curry dazzles, shimmies and makes us shake our head of disbelief every time the Warriors star steps on the floor.
Then there's Curry, who continues to smash the record books on his way to having the Warriors now one win away from his sixth trip to the NBA Finals.
Truth is, Doncic is here in the now and he isn't going anywhere.
With all that being said, did Curry find extra motivation in going head-to-head against the 23-year-old Doncic going into this series?
It isn't going to last forever, and it still remains the main reason the Warriors find themselves one win away from where they feel home in the NBA Finals.

     Summary: DALLAS (AP) ‚Äî Stephen Curry scored 31 points, Andrew Wiggins added 27 while posterizing Luka Doncic on a dunk and the Golden State Warriors beat the Dallas Mavericks 109‚Äì100 Sunday night for a 3‚Äì0 lead in the Western Conference finals.
No team has rallied from 3‚Äì0 down to win an NBA playoff series.
The Warriors challenged, and the ruling was Wiggins‚Äô elbow to Doncic was incidental contact, giving Golden State a 93‚Äì83 lead.
As he circled back toward his bench, Curry walked by Doncic with teammate Juan Toscano-Anderson nearby.
After the timeout, Curry could been seen saying, ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù and approached Doncic to talk about it.

Jalen Brunson made one of those at the end of the second quarter to give Dallas a one-point lead.
The Warriors‚Äô win did come with a costly loss.
The Warriors now own a comfortable 3-0 series lead, which no team has overcome to win a playoff series in NBA history.
Strength in numbers, that‚Äôs been our mantra.‚ÄùA Dallas win would force the series back to San Francisco for a Game 5, but the Warriors are hoping that won‚Äôt be necessary.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors are one win away from the NBA Finals after beating the Dallas Mavericks 109-100 in Game 3 on Sunday night.
Led by a 31-point performance from Stephen Curry, and 27 points from Andrew Wiggins, Golden State once again asserted its dominance over Dallas to take a commanding 3-0 series lead.
Here are three takeaways from Game 3 in Dallas.
Andrew Wiggins, take a bowLet's just take a look at this absurd dunk that Wiggins had on Doncic in the fourth quarter.
When all three of those guys are shooting that poorly, Dallas isn't going to win many games.
