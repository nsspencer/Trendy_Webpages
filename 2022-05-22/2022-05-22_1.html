    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City have won a fourth Premier League title in five years after Pep Guardiola’s side beat Aston Villa 3-2 on a dramatic final day of the 2021-22 season.
Their closest challengers, Liverpool, won 3-1 against Aston Villa at home, meaning City won the title by a solitary point.
It is the eighth time City have finished top of the English football pyramid and their sixth Premier League title, with Guardiola winning four titles since arriving at the club six years ago.
City and Liverpool have been involved in a thrilling title race all season long, with Jurgen Klopp’s side finishing just one point behind their rivals.
But Liverpool last touched the Premier League summit after a full matchday in late September.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the fourth time in five seasons, Manchester City reigns supreme atop the Premier League table.
It seemed as though City would lose the title after falling behind 2–0 to Villa, but everything changed when İlkay Gündoğan scored in the 76th minute.
Man City would likely trade places with Liverpool given its insatiable quest to become European champion, but it’ll instead settle for another English title achievement.
The title is its sixth in the Premier League era and eighth overall, snapping a tie with Aston Villa for fourth-most in history.
City’s marquee summer signing, £100 million man Jack Grealish, didn’t factor much into the club’s success, scoring just three goals in league play.

     Summary: MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Manchester City clinched a sixth Premier League title in 11 seasons on Sunday by scoring three times in five minutes to come from behind to beat Aston Villa 3-2 in the finale and hold off Liverpool’s challenge.
That scoreline would have taken Liverpool into first place had City not just mounted its fightback to take the lead.
The jeopardy was still there — with Andy Robertson sealing Liverpool’s 3-1 win — while City would have conceded the title had it conceded a late equalizer.
The rise of City coincided with the retirement of the Scot — who won the Premier League 13 times from 1993 to 2013 — and the decline of Manchester United.
In the last five seasons, the only time City didn’t win the trophy was when Liverpool’s 30-year title drought ended in 2020.
