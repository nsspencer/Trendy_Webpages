    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Close Salah takes part in Liverpool training, ahead of Premier League title-deciderLiverpool’s bid for an unprecedented quadruple of major trophies ended in agonizing fashion on Sunday despite coming from behind to beat Wolves 3-1 on the final day of the Premier League.
Liverpool finished a point behind City — just like in the 2018-19 season — and missed out on a record-tying 20th English league championship.
It is still an extraordinary season for Liverpool, who won both the FA Cup and League Cup and will play in the Champions League final against Real Madrid next weekend.
Pedro Neto gave Wolves the lead in the third minute after Ibrahima Konate misjudged a long ball forward, allowing Raul Jimenez to run through and cross for Neto to tap in.

Defence - Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joel Matip, Virgil Van Dijk, Andy RobertsonWorld Cup-winning Brazil captain Cafu expressed that Alexander-Arnold is "one of the best right-backs" globally.
He will lineup alongside Virgil Van Dijk, who returned to training after picking up a calf injury.
Thankfully, it wasn’t severe, and the Dutchman will play his part to get match fitness before the champions league final.
Diaz and Mané missed the Southampton game entirely and were not in the matchday squad.

     Summary: With City appearing to fall to pieces, Jurgen Klopp needed just one player to break Wolves’ brave second-half resistance and score the winner.
But by the time Mo Salah made it 2-1 and Andy Robertson got a third, City had already delivered their stunning transformation.
It would have been heart-break had City slipped up to Villa and Liverpool had failed to see off Wolves.
Thiago went down the tunnel before half-time with James Milner appearing in his place at the start of the second half.
Sub Bobby Firmino kept giving the ball away and Anfield went quiet as City scored those two goals.

     Liverpool's victory over Wolves in vain as quadruple bid ended
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Richard TannerGood afternoon, and welcome to Telegraph Sport's coverage of the final day of the 2021/22 Premier League season, as Liverpool hope for a Manchester City slip up to keep hopes of a historic quadruple alive.
Liverpool needed shoot-outs to beat Chelsea to win both the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, after two titanic goalless draws at Wembley, and also drew twice in the Premier League with Thomas Tuchel’s side.
If they are going to play in two competitions [Premier League and Champions League] they maybe need a few more players but they will bring them in.
Apart from promotion with Mainz, Klopp made his name by guiding Borussia Dortmund to the league and cup double before taking them to the Champions League final.
But he admits his spell at Liverpool, where he has now won all six major trophies – Club World Cup, Champions League, Uefa Super Cup, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup – has been the most exciting of his career.
