     Led by Steph Curry, the Golden State Warriors take commanding 3-0 WCF lead over the Dallas Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Golden State Warriors took a 3-0 series lead and edged closer to a place in the NBA Finals thanks to a 109-100 win over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday.
History is now on the Warriors' side, as no team has ever come back from a 3-0 series deficit in the NBA playoffs in 146 attempts.
"When you're up 2-0 and you win on the road, it gives you a stranglehold and control of the series.
That's huge," Curry told reporters.
"We obviously know that the job's not done, but it's a good feeling to know that we can play with house money on Tuesday and try and get the job done."

     In appreciation of Steph Curry having Warriors one win from NBA Finals return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS -- Steph Curry dazzles, shimmies and makes us shake our head of disbelief every time the Warriors star steps on the floor.
Then there's Curry, who continues to smash the record books on his way to having the Warriors now one win away from his sixth trip to the NBA Finals.
Truth is, Doncic is here in the now and he isn't going anywhere.
With all that being said, did Curry find extra motivation in going head-to-head against the 23-year-old Doncic going into this series?
It isn't going to last forever, and it still remains the main reason the Warriors find themselves one win away from where they feel home in the NBA Finals.

     Summary: ‚ÄúI can tell you everybody in the organization is happy he‚Äôs here,‚Äù Klay Thompson said of Wiggins after Game 3.
Wiggins is averaging 20.7 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game in his first conference finals.
You don‚Äôt win in the playoffs without guys like Wiggs.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs been not the most picturesque road for Wiggins to this moment.
On 134.2 partial possessions in which Wiggins has guarded Luka, Dallas has scored only 133 points, or 0.99 points per possession.
Darren Yamashita/USA TODAY SportsWhile no one is confusing Wiggins with Kevin Durant, his play does bring a certain dynamism to the Warriors.

     Summary: "None of these people really removed us from this space," Green told ESPN's Ohm Youngmisuk of the team missing the playoffs the previous two seasons.
"Toronto beat us, but no one really came and said, 'All right, the Golden State Warriors' time is up.'"
In the first round, Golden State took down two-time defending MVP Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets.

Led by a 31-point performance from Stephen Curry, and 27 points from Andrew Wiggins, Golden State once again asserted its dominance over Dallas to take a commanding 3-0 series lead.
Here are three takeaways from Game 3 in Dallas.
Andrew Wiggins, take a bowLet's just take a look at this absurd dunk that Wiggins had on Doncic in the fourth quarter.
When all three of those guys are shooting that poorly, Dallas isn't going to win many games.
