     Liverpool Suffer Huge Double Injury Blow Ahead Of Champions League Final Against Real Madrid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool have suffered a potential huge double injury blow ahead of the UEFA Champions League final against Real Madrid next Saturday.
Jurgen Klopp's team finished just one point behind City but as focus switches to the Champions League final, the German has two injury concerns.
Just before half-time, Thiago Alcantara, who had created the equaliser for Sadio Mane walked off after picking up a hamstring injury.
Whilst the injury doesn't look serious, recovery from a muscle injury like that in just six days is unlikely and it must cast a huge doubt over his availability.
Divock Origi was missing from the Reds squad that faced Wolves after it was revealed he had also picked up a muscle injury.

     Liverpool agonizingly misses out on the Premier League title despite beating Wolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) It was so close and yet so far for Liverpool.
As Manchester City trailed 2-0 at home to Aston Villa with just 15 minutes to go, Liverpool knew that -- barring a miracle at the Etihad Stadium -- a win over Wolves would secure a 20th league title for the Merseyside team.
Unfortunately for the Reds, so did that miracle over in Manchester.
So the historic quadruple chase is finally over and also the hope of securing the domestic treble, though it should be remembered that Liverpool never actually held top spot during Sunday's dramatic conclusion to the Premier League season.
Pipped to the crown by Manchester City by a single point for the second time in three seasons, goals from Sadio Mane, Andy Robertson, and Mohamed Salah ensured Liverpool held up their side of the bargain and pushed their Premier League title rival to the wire once again.

     Liverpool's Thiago likely out for Champions League final with injury - Jurgen Klopp
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thiago sustained a hamstring injury vs. Wolves in the Premier League on Sunday.
Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesMidfielder Thiago Alcantara is facing a battle to be fit for Liverpool's Champions League final against Real Madrid after manager Jurgen Klopp said a hamstring injury sustained by the midfielder against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday is "not good."
Fabinho (hamstring) and Virgil van Dijk (muscular strain) both missed the Wolves game, while forward Divock Origi has been ruled out of the Champions League final with a muscle injury suffered in training this week.
But while admitting that Thiago's injury is a concern, Klopp did not rule the Spain international out of the Madrid clash.
"Div is out [of the Champions League final]," Klopp said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Steve Gerrard, Gerrard,” they sang with gusto, and increasing optimism.
Liverpool was second again, one point back, and its bid for an unprecedented quadruple of major trophies ended in agonizing fashion.
“You can’t do more than give your absolute best and that’s what the boys did again,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said.
And Liverpool wound up fulfilling its part of the final-day bargain, scoring through a close-range effort from Salah and then Andrew Robertson in the 89th.
By then, City had completed its comeback at the Etihad and a subdued atmosphere greeted the final whistle at Anfield.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jürgen Klopp said the disappointment of missing out on the Premier League title would increase Liverpool’s desire to win the Champions League final, although Thiago Alcântara could be absent against Real Madrid after sustaining a suspected hamstring injury.
Klopp insisted his treble chasers would turn their Premier League deflation into a motivation when meeting the Spanish champions in Paris on Saturday.
The Liverpool manager said: “I can imagine it was much worse for the people at home watching on TV all over the world who were Liverpool fans.
We now have five days to prepare the final and we face an incredibly experienced team, but that’s really OK.
Losing the league today increases the desire to put it right next week.”Thiago headed straight down the tunnel in first-half stoppage time and hobbled through the post-match lap of honour.

Liverpool ended the Premier League season finishing in 2nd place just a single point behind champions Manchester City.
IMAGO / PA ImagesIn case you forgot, Liverpool play Real Madrid in the Champions League final in less than a week.
Winning the UEFA Champions League would see Liverpool complete the treble of FA Cup, Carabao Cup, and the European Cup.
Although the Belgian has seen his influence on the side diminish, his Champions League heroics will be missed.

     Summary: Liverpool gave it a run, but it came up short by a mere one point to Manchester City in this season’s final Premier League standings.
At one point during matchday 38, it seemed as if Liverpool would go on to shock the footballing world and leapfrog Manchester City to win the Premier League.
For Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, as he touched on after the 3-1 win over Wolverhampton, finishing second is all too familiar for him in his managerial career.
He has also capped off at the two-spot in the final league standings twice at Liverpool.
The Premier League powerhouse will now shift its attention to the upcoming 2022 UEFA Champions League Final against Real Madrid.
