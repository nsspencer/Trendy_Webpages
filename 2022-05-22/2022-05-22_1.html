     Manchester City Claims Title After Nearly Kicking It Away
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MANCHESTER, England — In that wild, euphoric moment, as the stands rattled and shook, Manchester City felt it again, that sensation it had known once, not all that long ago, the one enshrined in a shimmering statue on the plaza outside the Etihad Stadium.
They could, it turned out, come very close indeed.
None of it, though, has felt quite as primal, quite as visceral, as that.
That is no slight; what even the club has come to call “93:20” set the bar insurmountably high.
Nothing else could even come close.

     Thiago Alcantara Injury Latest: Liverpool Manager Jurgen Klopp Gives Worrying Update Ahead Of Champions League Final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has given a worrying injury update on midfielder Thiago Alcantara after his team just missed out on the title at Anfield on Sunday.
Just before half-time, Thiago, who had created the equaliser for Sadio Mane with a sensational backheel left the pitch after picking up a hamstring injury.
Speaking after the game Klopp gave a worrying update for Liverpool supporters who will be desperate for the diminutive playmaker to be fit for the final.
Should Thiago miss the final in Paris, it will be a huge blow to Klopp and Liverpool as he has been hugely influential over the past few months and they would have benefited from his experience against a wily Real Madrid team.

     Liverpool's Thiago likely out for Champions League final with injury - Jurgen Klopp
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thiago sustained a hamstring injury vs. Wolves in the Premier League on Sunday.
Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesMidfielder Thiago Alcantara is facing a battle to be fit for Liverpool's Champions League final against Real Madrid after manager Jurgen Klopp said a hamstring injury sustained by the midfielder against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday is "not good."
Fabinho (hamstring) and Virgil van Dijk (muscular strain) both missed the Wolves game, while forward Divock Origi has been ruled out of the Champions League final with a muscle injury suffered in training this week.
But while admitting that Thiago's injury is a concern, Klopp did not rule the Spain international out of the Madrid clash.
"Div is out [of the Champions League final]," Klopp said.

     Klopp insists league heartbreak will motivate Liverpool for European final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jürgen Klopp said the disappointment of missing out on the Premier League title would increase Liverpool’s desire to win the Champions League final, although Thiago Alcântara could be absent against Real Madrid after sustaining a suspected hamstring injury.
Klopp insisted his treble chasers would turn their Premier League deflation into a motivation when meeting the Spanish champions in Paris on Saturday.
The Liverpool manager said: “I can imagine it was much worse for the people at home watching on TV all over the world who were Liverpool fans.
We now have five days to prepare the final and we face an incredibly experienced team, but that’s really OK.
Losing the league today increases the desire to put it right next week.”Thiago headed straight down the tunnel in first-half stoppage time and hobbled through the post-match lap of honour.

     Summary: Liverpool came from a goal down to beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-1 on Sunday, but it was not enough to earn them their second Premier League title, as they finished second, one point behind champions Manchester City who beat Aston Villa 3-2.
Jurgen Klopp's men also have a Champions League final against Real Madrid to look forward to next weekend.
Liverpool beat Wolves but didn't do enough to win the Premier League.
However, by that time City had completed their own comeback 3-2 win over Villa, meaning they retained the title and Liverpool finished the season as runners-up.
Wolves finished 10th on 51 points.

Liverpool went to the end against Wolves, and in that respect it summed up the season.
With no control over the Manchester City result, this was all they could do in their quest for the title.
For a long time, it looked as though Manchester City would slip up, only for Liverpool to fail to capitalise.

     Summary: Then word coming through that City had kicked off again, that the goal stood, that this might actually be happening.
That season Liverpool won the Champions League and, although the quadruple has again proved elusive, that prize perhaps awaits next weekend.
The possibility that Steven Gerrard might at last win the title for Liverpool had been teased almost to breaking point.
Could this also be Benítez securing a league title for what has always felt like his one true club?
Gerrard coming close but not quite close enough in the league is itself a well-worn trope: this, in fact, does usually slip.

     Liverpool agonizingly misses out on the Premier League title despite beating Wolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Manchester City trailed 2-0 at home to Aston Villa with just 15 minutes to go, Liverpool knew that – barring a miracle at the Etihad Stadium – a win over Wolves would secure a 20th league title for the Merseyside team.
So the historic quadruple chase is finally over and also the hope of securing the domestic treble, though it should be remembered that Liverpool never actually held top spot during Sunday’s dramatic conclusion to the Premier League season.
Having lifted a first league title in 30 years to empty stands during the pandemic two years ago, to secure the 20th in a full stadium would have sweetened the achievement tenfold for Liverpool.
“Obviously a few nerves today, but in the end I thought we came through really well,” Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson told Sky Sports.
We’ve got to say congratulations to City of course, and then focus on the match next week.”

Liverpool ended the Premier League season finishing in 2nd place just a single point behind champions Manchester City.
IMAGO / PA ImagesIn case you forgot, Liverpool play Real Madrid in the Champions League final in less than a week.
Winning the UEFA Champions League would see Liverpool complete the treble of FA Cup, Carabao Cup, and the European Cup.
Although the Belgian has seen his influence on the side diminish, his Champions League heroics will be missed.

     Summary: “Steve Gerrard, Gerrard,” they sang with gusto, and increasing optimism.
Liverpool was second again, one point back, and its bid for an unprecedented quadruple of major trophies ended in agonizing fashion.
“You can’t do more than give your absolute best and that’s what the boys did again,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said.
And Liverpool wound up fulfilling its part of the final-day bargain, scoring through a close-range effort from Salah and then Andrew Robertson in the 89th.
By then, City had completed its comeback at the Etihad and a subdued atmosphere greeted the final whistle at Anfield.
