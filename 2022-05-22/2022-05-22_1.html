     Liverpool vs Wolves LIVE: Premier League result and reaction - Reds lose title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Close Salah takes part in Liverpool training, ahead of Premier League title-deciderLiverpool’s bid for an unprecedented quadruple of major trophies ended in agonizing fashion on Sunday despite coming from behind to beat Wolves 3-1 on the final day of the Premier League.
Liverpool finished a point behind City — just like in the 2018-19 season — and missed out on a record-tying 20th English league championship.
It is still an extraordinary season for Liverpool, who won both the FA Cup and League Cup and will play in the Champions League final against Real Madrid next weekend.
Pedro Neto gave Wolves the lead in the third minute after Ibrahima Konate misjudged a long ball forward, allowing Raul Jimenez to run through and cross for Neto to tap in.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With City appearing to fall to pieces, Jurgen Klopp needed just one player to break Wolves’ brave second-half resistance and score the winner.
But by the time Mo Salah made it 2-1 and Andy Robertson got a third, City had already delivered their stunning transformation.
It would have been heart-break had City slipped up to Villa and Liverpool had failed to see off Wolves.
Thiago went down the tunnel before half-time with James Milner appearing in his place at the start of the second half.
Sub Bobby Firmino kept giving the ball away and Anfield went quiet as City scored those two goals.

Defence - Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joel Matip, Virgil Van Dijk, Andy RobertsonWorld Cup-winning Brazil captain Cafu expressed that Alexander-Arnold is "one of the best right-backs" globally.
He will lineup alongside Virgil Van Dijk, who returned to training after picking up a calf injury.
Thankfully, it wasn’t severe, and the Dutchman will play his part to get match fitness before the champions league final.
Diaz and Mané missed the Southampton game entirely and were not in the matchday squad.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool welcome Wolverhampton Wanderers to Anfield for the final game of the 2021-22 Premier League season with the title still a possibility, but to even have a realistic chance Jürgen Klopp’s players will need all three points on Sunday in the domestic season’s final round of action.
They will also need Steven Gerrard and Aston Villa, who visit Manchester City today for their final game of the season, to earn some kind of a result.
But there’s a chance, and Liverpool fans will be keeping a close eye on both matches with a chance at their twentieth league title on the line.
For Wolves, on the other hand, they currently sit eighth, five points behind West Ham and a Europa Conference League place.
Depending on results today, then, they could stay where they are or drop to ninth or tenth.
