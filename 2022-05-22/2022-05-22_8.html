Defence - Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joel Matip, Virgil Van Dijk, Andy RobertsonWorld Cup-winning Brazil captain Cafu expressed that Alexander-Arnold is "one of the best right-backs" globally.
He will lineup alongside Virgil Van Dijk, who returned to training after picking up a calf injury.
Thankfully, it wasn’t severe, and the Dutchman will play his part to get match fitness before the champions league final.
Diaz and Mané missed the Southampton game entirely and were not in the matchday squad.

The manner of the outcome means Liverpool will undoubtedly feel deflated, as the quadruple dream finally died in late May.

The best tonic for this disappointment will be a win in the Champions League final, just as in 2019.

Liverpool relaxed, dominated the final six minutes, as people thought they might command the full 90, and scored a third through Andy Robertson.
In 2019, they had beaten Wolves in the final fixture at Anfield to come second behind Manchester City with 97.

     Liverpool vs Wolves LIVE: Premier League result and reaction - Reds lose title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Close Salah takes part in Liverpool training, ahead of Premier League title-deciderLiverpool’s bid for an unprecedented quadruple of major trophies ended in agonizing fashion on Sunday despite coming from behind to beat Wolves 3-1 on the final day of the Premier League.
Liverpool finished a point behind City — just like in the 2018-19 season — and missed out on a record-tying 20th English league championship.
It is still an extraordinary season for Liverpool, who won both the FA Cup and League Cup and will play in the Champions League final against Real Madrid next weekend.
Pedro Neto gave Wolves the lead in the third minute after Ibrahima Konate misjudged a long ball forward, allowing Raul Jimenez to run through and cross for Neto to tap in.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With City appearing to fall to pieces, Jurgen Klopp needed just one player to break Wolves’ brave second-half resistance and score the winner.
But by the time Mo Salah made it 2-1 and Andy Robertson got a third, City had already delivered their stunning transformation.
It would have been heart-break had City slipped up to Villa and Liverpool had failed to see off Wolves.
Thiago went down the tunnel before half-time with James Milner appearing in his place at the start of the second half.
Sub Bobby Firmino kept giving the ball away and Anfield went quiet as City scored those two goals.
