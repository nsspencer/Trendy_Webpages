     How much will the winner of the PGA Championship win in 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the prize money continues to skyrocket across the world of golf, the majors are keeping up as well.
The prize pool at the 2022 PGA Championship will match that of the 2022 Masters, as a total of $15 million is on offer to the 79 players that made the cut this weekend.
That’s a $3 million increase from last year, and the standard PGA Tour payout chart is used.
That means 18% of the pool goes to the tournament winner, which translates to a cool $2.7 million along with the Wanamaker Trophy for a victory.
Here’s what the 2022 PGA Championship prize pool breakdown looks like based off this list from The Golf News Net:

     Summary: The PGA Championship prize money has been increased by $3m for 2022, with the total purse now up to $15m and a winner's cheque of $2.7m for this year's tournament at Southern Hills.
Last year's winner Phil Mickelson won $2.16m of the $12m prize pool at Kiawah Island, with Collin Morikawa earning $1.89m at TPC Harding Park from the $11m PGA Championship prize money.
The increase in prize money from the PGA of America follows that of Augusta National, which also raised its total prize pool to $15m last month.
Prize money continues to grow on the PGA Tour, and grow fast, with the new Saudi-backed LIV Golf Invitational Series a likely reason why.
