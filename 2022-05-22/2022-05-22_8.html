     Ralf Rangnick Creates New Manchester United Record After Crystal Palace Defeat, With Lowest Win Percentage in 50 Years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ralf Rangnick Creates New Manchester United Record After Crystal Palace Defeat, With Lowest Win Percentage in 50 YearsRalf Rangnick has broken a Manchester United record with his teams low win percentage while he has been manager.
United fell to Crystal Palace on the final day of the season, losing 1-0 away from home.
Since arriving after the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November, the German coach has ended his spell as manager with a 37.9% win percentage in the games he has managed.
This is the worst in the Premier League era for the club and more so, the worst in 50 whole years, with Frank O'Farrell's 1972 United team the last to achieve such a low.

De Gea, 31, was speaking after United’s 1-0 loss to Crystal Palace on the final day of the season.
Fortunately for Manchester United, however, West Ham’s loss to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion ensured that United finish in sixth and qualify for the Europa League.
Addressing his teammates, De Gea said: “Ones who want to stay, stay at the club.
Tottenham Hotspur qualified for the Champions League after a 5-0 win at Norwich, while Leeds United’s victory against Brentford saw them stay up at Burnley’s expense.
