     Man City Win Title After Thrilling Fight Back￼
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: - Advertisement -Manchester City staged a stunning late comeback with three goals in five minutes to beat Aston Villa and win the Premier League as their title chances looked to be slipping away amid dramatic scenes at Etihad Stadium.
It looked as if Villa manager Steven Gerrard might help his former club Liverpool secure the title – until City turned the game on its head in at atmosphere bordering on hysteria.
City did need those three points as Liverpool beat Wolverhampton Wanderers – with City boss Guardiola overcome with emotion and breaking down in tears at the final whistle.
When Coutinho slid in Villa’s second goal, it looked as if the most unpalatable of storylines was being written for Manchester City.
And then, in one of the most dramatic twists of any Premier League title race, City knocked down the door that had been firmly slammed in their face by a supremely well-organised Villa.

     Summary: The jeopardy was still there — with Andy Robertson sealing Liverpool’s 3-1 win — while City would have conceded the title had it conceded a late equalizer.
“He came on and changed the whole game,” City midfielder Phil Foden said.
The rise of City coincided with the retirement of the Scot — who won the Premier League 13 times from 1993 to 2013 — and the decline of Manchester United.
In the last five seasons, the only time City didn’t win the trophy was when Liverpool’s 30-year title drought ended in 2020.
“Tomorrow we can celebrate together in the Manchester streets with cigars and beers,” the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach said after winning a 10th league title in management.

     Summary: Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester City v Aston Villa - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - May 22, 2022 Manchester City's Fernandinho lifts the trophy as he celebrates with teammates after winning the Premier League REUTERS/Hannah MckayMANCHESTER, May 22 (Reuters) - Manchester City won their fourth Premier League trophy in five years on Sunday but nearly let it slip from their hands, coming from two goals down to beat Aston Villa 3-2 with three goals inside an electrifying five minutes late in the second half.
Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan scored twice as City took the vital three points, making Liverpool's 3-1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers irrelevant.
When you win the Premier League four times in five seasons it’s because these guys are so, so special.
But that was soon to change as Villa, managed by former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, provided a twist in the storyline.
But then came the City comeback blitz that sealed the title regardless of events at Anfield.
