     PGA Championship 2022: The clubs Justin Thomas used to win at Southern Hills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It seemed implausible, if not impossible that Justin Thomas would win his second PGA Championship.
Starting the day seven shots in arrears, Thomas spent the bulk of the day not even on the first page of the leaderboard.
But the 2017 PGA champ kept chipping away, playing the final nine holes in 32 to give him a final-round 67, and eventually, a playoff with Will Zalatoris after Mito Pereira knocked his tee shot in the water on 18 and made double bogey.

     Justin Thomas Wins the P.G.A. Championship With a Roaring Comeback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Championship revolved around Phil Mickelson, who became the oldest major champion last year when he won the event at age 50 but chose not to defend his title.
In a taut, three-hole aggregate playoff after the 18-hole fourth round ended in a tie, Justin Thomas, 29, held off the 25-year-old rising star Will Zalatoris to win his second P.G.A.
Championship.
The last four winners of golf’s major championships, Thomas; Scottie Scheffler, at the Masters; Collin Morikawa, at the British Open; and Jon Rahm, the reigning U.S. Open champion, are in their 20s.
Even in defeat, Zalatoris briefly laughed as he assessed how his generation had become dominant so quickly.

     Justin Thomas takes PGA from uninspiring to unforgettable
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chile's Mito Pereira had a career-changing moment staring him in the face until a fateful shot on the 18th hole.
That's about the time the PGA Championship went from uninspiring to unbelievable.
He never gave himself a chance for birdie at 18, instead making a nervy 8-footer to stay there.
After the two matched birdies at the 13th hole, Thomas showed the kind of calm that comes with having been in such a situation before, ripping his tee shot onto the green at the 308-yard 17th.
“I was asked earlier in the week what lead is safe, and I said, ‘No lead.’ This place is so tough.

     2022 PGA Championship: Justin Thomas shows poise capitalizing on precious opportunity to win second major
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I just remember how tough it was, and I remember how tough it is now to win," said Thomas.
It seemed as if one of the surprisingly few true opportunities he's had to win a major was gone before it fully materialized.
Then something happened that reminded everyone of his last major win, the 2017 PGA Championship at Quail Hollow.
Just before moving to a more private area to view the ending of the tournament, Thomas looked up and said to nobody in particular, "Hope for the best, man."
"I just think it's just so hard to win," Thomas said when asked about the emotion afterward.
