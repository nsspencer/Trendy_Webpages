     Rafael Nadal Is the French Open’s Man of Mystery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been a long time since Nadal showed up in Paris and this tournament was not his to lose.
Nadal’s winning the French Open was long the closest thing to a foregone conclusion in this sport or any other.
In October 2020, with the pandemic having prompted the French Tennis Federation to move the tournament to early fall from late spring, Nadal stampeded through the competition without dropping a set.
And after just a few weeks of preparation and a single tournament, Nadal won the Australian Open in January, showing the world once more that counting him out is a terrible idea.
But in recent days, the pain has been difficult again, and the top players can sense that the 2022 French Open has a different feel than others in recent memory.

The teenager, who reached the third round as a qualifier last year in Paris, has taken the tennis world by storm this season with four titles and has arrived at the French Open established as one of the title favourites.
"I always say that you have to improve every day if you are the best player in the world.

Dominic Thiem is still finding his feet after injury and was completely outplayed by Hugo Dellien in a 6-3 6-2 6-4 defeat.

     Dominic Thiem and Ons Jabeur slip to first-round defeats in French Open
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There was a time, not long ago, when Dominic Thiem was better placed than anyone to emerge as the next new champion on these grounds.
For four consecutive years, from 2016 and 2019, Thiem marched deep into the French Open draw and allowed himself to be taken out by only the greatest.
Just two hours into the tournament yesterday afternoon, Thiem suffered a disappointing and at times hard to watch first-round defeat to Hugo Dellien of Bolivia, who easily beat him 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.
Since returning from a nine-month injury layoff due to a right wrist injury and various complications, Thiem has lost all of his seven matches back, winning only two sets between them.
The clearest issue for Thiem is his forehand, the focal point of his game and the stroke naturally most affected by the wrist injury.
