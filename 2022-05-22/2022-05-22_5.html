     Who should replace Sam Girard in Avalanche lineup? (+)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Jared Bednar said today that he might put Ryan Murray or Kurtis MacDermid in there instead.
So, we’ll have to wait and see who’s in for Game 4 tomorrow night here.
For me, Johnson brings the best of all elements not only to replace Girard, but for how Game 4 might be played.
He played 74 games for the Avs in the regular season and he played very well.
He played very well and greatly contributed to a team that had the best record in the Western Conference.

     Avalanche center Nazem Kadri has received threats in St. Louis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ST. LOUIS — Avalanche forward Nazem Kadri has received threats here following his collision with Blues goaltender Jordan Binnington in Saturday’s Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinal series at Enterprise Center.
“The Avalanche organization is aware of threats made toward Nazem Kadri and is working with local law enforcement to investigate,” the club said in a statement.
Naz has been subject to so many racist attacks and threats since last night that police had to be brought in.
Rosen appeared to push Kadri into Binnington and the goalie sustained a lower-body injury that will prevent him from playing again in the series.
Kadri served an eight-game suspension for a check to the head of Blues defenseman Justin Faulk in last year’s playoffs.
