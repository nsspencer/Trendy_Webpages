     How PSG convinced Mbappe to sign new contract and snub Real Madrid transfer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How did Paris Saint-Germain convince Kylian Mbappe to sign a new contract and snub a transfer to Real Madrid?
Mbappe's previous contract was due to expire on June 30 and it was widely reported that Madrid already had an agreement in place to sign the striker on a free transfer.
A final deal never came to fruition, however, with Mbappe ultimately deciding to pen fresh terms with PSG that will keep him at Parc des Princes for another three years.
Mbappe is also set to receive a signing bonus of over ‚Ç¨100 million (¬£85m/$106m) and club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has promised him there will be wholesale changes at both boardroom and squad level.

     Kylian Mbappe: Why Paris Saint-Germain believe star‚Äôs new ‚Ç¨105m contract will pay for itself

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kylian Mbappe: Why Paris Saint-Germain believe star‚Äôs new ‚Ç¨105m contract will pay for itselfKylian Mbappe has signed a new three-year contract at Paris Saint-Germain after rejecting a move to Real MadridParis Saint-Germain believe Kylian Mbappe‚Äôs lucrative new ‚Ç¨105m contract, which helped to keep him out of the clutches of Real Madrid, will pay for itself.
Mbappe signed a new three-year deal with PSG on Saturday worth around ‚Ç¨35m a year, putting the 23-year-old France forward in the same pay bracket as team-mate Lionel Messi.
On top of any new business that Mbappe‚Äôs new contract might generate, his employers believe they can recoup the signing-on fee should they sell before 2025.
Mbappe had been expected to leave Paris for Spain this summer but made both clubs wait until the final weekend of the French season for his decision.
In a statement issued on Saturday before Mbappe‚Äôs new PSG deal had even been confirmed, LaLiga said the contract ‚Äúattacks the economic stability of European football‚Äù.
