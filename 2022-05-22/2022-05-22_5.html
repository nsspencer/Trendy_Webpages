    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Listen to this articleThe strategy was revealed by F1 boss Stefano Domenicali during his regular Saturday “coffee morning” meeting with team principals in Barcelona.
The sport has been hit not just by rising prices but increasingly scarce availability of freight capacity.
While some races have traditionally been grouped together, there are anomalies in the calendar in the way some flyaway races are placed.
This season Miami was a standalone race involving a North American trip for just one race weekend, while the upcoming races in Baku and Montreal are back-to-backs but obviously far apart geographically.
The Middle Eastern races could also be paired, with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia together at the start of the year, and Qatar and Abu Dhabi towards the end.

So the power unit will be [sent] back to Maranello, travelling during the night, and we will disassemble it tomorrow morning."
After two events where Ferrari had been caught out by worse tyre wear than Red Bull, Leclerc reckoned that things were very different this time around and the team had everything under control.
Asked if he felt without the failure he would have gone on for a straightforward win, he said: "With the laps I had done, honestly, everything was going really, really well.

     Summary: Charles Leclerc had been dominant from pole until his race fell apart with a power unit failure just short of the midway point.
Charles Leclerc leads the Spanish Grand Prix ahead of Max Verstappen before the Ferrari driver was forced to retire.
Russell vying brilliantly with Verstappen, and Hamilton coming through the field would have been unthinkable with the car that opened the season.
“With Lewis we had probably the fastest race car today,” he said.
Verstappen and Red Bull, however, stuck at their task and delivered an adaptive strategy to secure an impressive victory.

     F1 Standings Take a Turn As Leclerc Retires: Three Takeaways From Spain

     Summary: Meanwhile, the now-former leader in the driver standings, Charles Leclerc, held the lead up until lap 27 when he lost power, forcing him to retire.
But Pérez said after the race: “I’m happy for the team, but we need to speak later.”Here’s three takeaways from the Spanish Grand Prix.
Red Bull arguably made some questionable decisions with their drivers, electing to prioritize Verstappen over Pérez.
Although the Red Bull drivers made their way past the young rising star, he held on to score his second podium this season.
Red Bull leads the Constructor standings with 195 points compared to Ferrari’s 169.

Hamilton asked Mercedes over the radio if it would be worth saving the engine on his car, only to be told that he could still finish as high as eighth.
Hamilton revealed that a conversation with a terminally-ill child on Saturday had served as inspiration for him through Sunday's race.
"Ultimately there was quite a bit of adversity in that race, starting so far back," Hamilton said.
"I said I don't know if I can win the race, but I'll give it everything.

Max Verstappen takes the checkered flag a full 13 seconds ahead of his nearest competitor in Spain on Sunday.
Anadolu Agency Getty Images'Green Red Bull' Can't Save Aston MartinAston Martin rattled a few cages early in the weekend when its heavily revised AMR22 was introduced.
Very quickly it had the nickname ‘the green Red Bull’ based off its striking similarities to Red Bull’s RB18.
The FIA noted how similar the updated AMR22 was to the RB18 and undertook an investigation before swiftly clearing Aston Martin of any wrongdoing.
