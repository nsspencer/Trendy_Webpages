     Rafael Nadal Is the French Open’s Man of Mystery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been a long time since Nadal showed up in Paris and this tournament was not his to lose.
Nadal’s winning the French Open was long the closest thing to a foregone conclusion in this sport or any other.
In October 2020, with the pandemic having prompted the French Tennis Federation to move the tournament to early fall from late spring, Nadal stampeded through the competition without dropping a set.
And after just a few weeks of preparation and a single tournament, Nadal won the Australian Open in January, showing the world once more that counting him out is a terrible idea.
But in recent days, the pain has been difficult again, and the top players can sense that the 2022 French Open has a different feel than others in recent memory.

     Summary: PARIS (Reuters) – Teenage sensation Carlos Alcaraz steamrolled past Argentine lucky loser Juan Ignacio Londero 6-4 6-2 6-0 to kick off his French Open campaign in solid fashion on Sunday.
The teenager, who reached the third round as a qualifier last year in Paris, has taken the tennis world by storm this season with four titles and has arrived at the French Open established as one of the title favourites.
A wide forehand by Londero gave Alcaraz a break for 4-2 in the second set.
His devastating forehand continued its demolition job on a sorry Londero, who misfired again on set point to give Alcaraz a definitive edge.
The third set was a one-sided affair that lasted only half an hour as the sun set on the French capital.
