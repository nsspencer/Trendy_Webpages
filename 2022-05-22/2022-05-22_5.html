     Soccer-AC Milan win first Serie A title in 11 years after final-day victory at Sassuolo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SASSUOLO, Italy (Reuters) – AC Milan clinched their first Italian Serie A title in 11 years after earning a 3-0 final-day victory at Sassuolo on Sunday, with a double from Olivier Giroud and one from Franck Kessie sealing the Scudetto in style.
There was no relenting from Milan as Kessie slotted home a third four minutes later to effectively put the game, and title race, to bed before halftime.
Milan showed no sign of any early nerves as they took the game to mid-table Sassuolo.
Kessie, who according to widespread reports in Italy was playing his last game for Milan before joining Barcelona in the close season, then side-footed home the third with ease to complete the job.
Milan’s jubilant supporters swarmed the pitch as the match drew to its conclusion, embracing players and staff at every opportunity, with their wait for another league title finally over.
