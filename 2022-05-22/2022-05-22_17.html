     Villarreal qualify for Europe with final day win over Barcelona
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Villarreal will play in Europe again next season after a final day win over Barcelona.
Unai Emery’s men went into the final weekend knowing they needed to match or better Athletic Club’s result to qualify for next season’s Europa Conference League.
But they will now enter the Conference League for the first time having finished seventh in the La Liga table.
All in all, it’s been a pretty rewarding one.
The La Liga campaign has been pretty disappointing again, but with a Champions League semi-final, which has proved hugely rewarding financially, club chiefs will be happy.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Athletic's defeat, combined with Villarreal's excellent victory at Camp Nou, means Villarreal beat Athletic into seventh and qualify for the Europa Conference League.
Granada were held to a goalless draw by Espanyol, allowing Cadiz, who won 1-0 away at Alaves, to survive.
Defeat by Villarreal means Barcelona lost four of their last nine games in all competitions while Real Madrid won La Liga at a canter.
Anthony Lozano proved the hero, his finish securing victory away at Alaves for Cadiz, while Granada were held to a stalemate at home to Espanyol.
Clement Grenier added another as Mallorca won 2-0 away at El Sadar to avoid the drop.

     Barcelona vs Villarreal, La Liga: Final Score 0-2, Barça finish season with bad loss at home
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona’s 2021-22 has come to an end on a bit of depressing note thanks to a 2-0 loss to Villarreal at Camp Nou in the season finale on Sunday night.
Barça almost equalized immediately with a nice volley from Ferran Torres, but Gerónimo Rulli made a nice save and kept his team in front.
Neither team really went for it and just ran out the clock the dying moments, and the final whistle came to end Barça’s season in depressing fashion.
Despite this result, though, the season has gone a lot better than it was with Ronald Koeman as the coach.
Xavi has brought hope and good football, and next season could be a fun one.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Villarreal needed Athletic not to win away at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan against Sevilla to guarantee themselves European football for next season.
TALKING POINT - VILLARREAL SEAL EUROPEAN FOOTBALL IN STYLEDespite an underwhelming season in La Liga, which has seen Villarreal record eleven defeats - including to already relegated Alaves and Levante respectively, Unai Emery's side end the campaign on a hugely positive note.
(Alfonso Pedraza) - Pedraza has given the away side the lead at the Camp Nou!
Villarreal seal their first league win over Barcelona since March 2008 (a 2-1 win at the Camp Nou).
Dani Parejo's ten assists in La Liga mean he is joint-top of the assist table, alongside Iker Muniain and Jordi Alba.
