     Summary: APFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Ryan Blaney is talking about framing the window net from his No.
Even runner-up Denny Hamlin agreed to that, but was frustrated that Blaney wasn't black-flagged for dropping his window net when initially thinking that Sunday night's race was over.
12 crew was already celebrating the victory in the pits and Blaney had lowered the window net on the backstretch.
Blaney spent pretty much the entire caution period trying to secure the net, all while having to maintain speed.
Hamlin wrote in a tweet after the race that NASCAR “put Blaney in the situation he was in.

     Ryan Blaney wins NASCAR All-Star Race -- but inadvertent mistake almost costs him $1 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In its 38-year history, the NASCAR All-Star Race has been an event where we’ve seen experimentation with rules (and some of which have ultimately gone on to be implemented in the future in regular points-paying events).
But Sunday night at Texas Motor Speedway, we witnessed one of the strangest outcomes to not just any All-Star Race that’s ever been held, but ANY NASCAR race for that matter.
But because the All-Star Race rules are different than points-paying race rules, the race had to finish under green-flag conditions.
And that’s when the All-Star Race rules nuance almost cost Blaney the $1 million prize.
And to add insult to injury – and again, doing it without really thinking and almost in automatic fashion – Blaney pulled down his window net.

If I send him into traffic and he’s got no window net, then what, right?

Trackhouse Racing’s Daniel Suárez, who advanced out of the All-Star Open race held earlier Sunday evening, finished fifth.

Blaney attempted to put his window net back up, but fastening and securing the window net is not easily done from the driver's seat.
As a result, Blaney was only able to get his window net put back up in a haphazard and loose fashion.
As for the no-call on Blaney's window net, Miller cited circumstantial evidence that Blaney's window net may have been adequately fastened.

Remember when the All-Star race was one of the most anticipated races of the year?
The All-Star race is meant to be the site of beating and banging as well as side-by-side, white knuckle racing.
Paint scheme of the raceThere was a time when the All-Star race featured a field full of fun alternate colored paint schemes that were often memorable to race fans.
However, in the end it’s still weighing the lesser of two evils, and only further proves the All-Star race needs a change.
