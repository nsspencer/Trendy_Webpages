     Summary: With Selection Sunday coming up quickly, Rutgers Basketball (18-12, 12-8 Big Ten) is hoping that they will be headed to the NCAA Tournament for the second year in a row for the first time since the 1975 and 1976 seasons.

With some having the Scarlet Knights as high as a 10-seed and others as low as a 12-seed.
This is the best league in the country," Illinois coach said of Rutgers.
But beyond that, right now, they're just playing harder than 90% of the competition that I've seen on film.

     Rutgers eyes most important thing on emotional Senior Day: A win over Penn State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The scene is set for Sunday to be one of the greatest days in Rutgers basketball history.
It is not a given that the Scarlet Knights will run over their visitors.
Penn State romped Rutgers (17-12, 11-8) when the two teams faced off in State College in January, the Nittany Lions leading from wire-to-wire and dominating the Scarlet Knights in multiple areas.
It is a chance for one of the greatest generations of Scarlet Knights to put a stamp on their historic run.
A win over Penn State would ensure it will be remembered for all the right reasons.

But the Scarlet Knights found a way, as they have so often over the last three years, in part because they held Penn State to 32 percent shooting from the field.
It forced another after the under-four minute timeout after Penn State had cut a 15-point deficit down to seven.
