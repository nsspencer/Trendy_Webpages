     Woman, fetus die after migrants abandoned in truck in Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mexican authorities say a pregnant woman and her unborn child died after dozens of migrants were abandoned in an overheated freight truck in northern MexicoMEXICO CITY -- A pregnant woman and her unborn child died and 14 people were hospitalized, most for severe dehydration, after dozens of migrants were abandoned in an overheated freight truck in northern Mexico, authorities said Sunday.
Immigration officials said 64 migrants were found in the freight container, where temperatures reached over 100 degrees (40 Celsius).
There might have been more migrants jammed in the vehicle, but authorities said some might have fled.
The National Immigration Institute said the truck was found Saturday in the northern border state of Coahuila.
The agency said it “condemns the fact that ‘guides’ and traffickers profit from and endanger the lives of migrants.” It said it would grant humanitarian visas to the migrants, as is often done in Mexico when migrants are considered victims of a crime.

     Summary: The scene is set for Sunday to be one of the greatest days in Rutgers basketball history.

Penn State romped Rutgers (17-12, 11-8) when the two teams faced off in State College in January, the Nittany Lions leading from wire-to-wire and dominating the Scarlet Knights in multiple areas.
It is a chance for one of the greatest generations of Scarlet Knights to put a stamp on their historic run.

     Riot at Mexico soccer match leaves three people in critical condition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Three people were in critical condition on Sunday after violent clashes at a soccer match in the Mexican state of Queretaro left more than two dozen people hospitalized, and officials said they would prosecute some assailants for attempted murder.
“Even though there are no deaths, we can’t say this isn’t a tragedy,” Queretaro Governor Mauricio Kuri told a news conference.
Soccer fans on Saturday stormed the pitch during a top flight match between mid-table Queretaro and last year’s Liga MX champions Atlas.
(Foto: Twitter/@PelonGomis)The regional governing Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), which includes Mexico’s Liga MX, on Sunday called on authorities to investigate the attacks.
Liga MX suspended Saturday’s match after 62 minutes with visitors Atlas leading 1-0, and also called off planned games for Sunday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Queretaro state governor, Mauricio Kuri, promised an in-depth investigation, but he also pointed the finger at the club.
It was obvious that they did what they wanted to do with us," said an Atlas fan in a TV interview.
Liga MX taking actionIn the hours after the incidents, Liga MX followed up with a statement confirming the opening of an investigation, the activation of the league's Disciplinary Commission to begin the sanctioning process, and the pursuit of criminal complaints as necessary.
Despite calls to immediately suspend play around the league, the Liga MX matches scheduled for later Saturday night moved forward as planned.
But after their conclusion, Liga MX announced the suspension of all men's and women's professional matches on the slate through at least March 8.

     Rutgers avoids disaster in outlasting Penn State with March Madness 2022 berth likely
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ron Harper Jr. defends Penn State’s Sam Sessoms during Rutgers’ win on March 6, 2022.
“I’m almost envious,” Penn State coach Micah Shrewsberry said.
“My hope for one day is to make Penn State the same exact way.
But the Scarlet Knights found a way, as they have so often over the last three years, in part because they held Penn State to 32 percent shooting from the field.
It forced another after the under-four minute timeout after Penn State had cut a 15-point deficit down to seven.
