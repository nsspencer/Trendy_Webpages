     Ball Boy Mikel Arteta Assists Classic Arsenal Goal As Young Gunners Shine In Win At Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal's youngsters stole the show in Sunday's 3-2 win at Watford but 39-year-old manager Mikel Arteta also played a key part in one of his side's goals.
What a beautiful goal it was too, with the final three players involved all taking just one touch.
Arteta played the role of ball boy as he quickly fed Bukayo Saka who set Arsenal on the attack with a throw-in to Cedric Soares.
That Martinelli goal made the score 3-1 to Arsenal seven minutes into the second half.
Saka had earlier set up Odegaard for Arsenal's opener, before scoring their second goal himself.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal moved up into the top four of the Premier League after a 3-2 win against Watford at Vicarage Road.
The Gunners won their fourth game in a row to jump above Manchester United and West Ham in the table thanks to goals from Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli.

Bukayo Saka then regained the lead in the first half for Arsenal with a powerful finish after some great link-up with Alexandre Lacazette.
Moussa Sissoko’s late goal gave Watford hope in stoppage time, but they could not avoid an eighth straight home league defeat.

Mikel Arteta's side scored a third on 52 minutes as Gabriel Martinelli finished off a wonderful team move.

Dennis had a big chance to pull one back for Watford in the closing stages but scuffed his shot with the goal gaping.

     Young guns Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli are creating and scoring, and centre forward Alex Lacazette is playing as well as he has played in Arsenal colours.
Arsenal were defending as if trying to avoid contact when Watford levelled, six minutes later.
Cucho Hernandez met it with a spectacular scissor kick, sent flashing past Aaron Ramsdale in the Arsenal goal.
At times, Arsenal appeared in complete control and yet ever vulnerable to Watford’s pace and movement up front.
Watford have not taken a single point at home since they beat Manchester United in November and games are disappearing fast.

     Watford vs Arsenal LIVE: Premier League result, final score and reaction - Odegaard, Saka and Martinelli win it for Gunners

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Close Arsenal stars train at Emirates before Watford testArsenal climbed back into the Premier League top four as goals from Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli helped them to a lively 3-2 win over Watford at Vicarage Road.
It was a victory more convincing for the Gunners than the scoreline suggests, as their young attacking players shone to punish a Hornets side that, to their credit, fought gamely until the end.
But a draw would have more than the Hornets deserved and their battle against relegation from the Premier League is looking like an increasingly uphill battle.
For their part, the Gunners have their top-four destiny in their own hands and three sublime finishes from Odegaard, Saka and Martinelli – all of whom should have big futures at the Emirates – demonstrated the quality Mikel Arteta can call on as the season reaches the business end.

     More infoArsenal continued their charge towards a top-four finish in the Premier League with a 3-2 win over Watford at Vicarage Road.
Moussa Sissoko's late strike put their lead under question but Arteta's side held on for an important three points.
That put win puts Arsenal back in the driving seat to secure a top-four finish, with a point advantage over Manchester United and two games in hand.
The football on show from the visitors was mesmeric at times, largely owing to the link-up between Saka and Odegaard.
If Arsenal are to truly challenge for a top-four spot at the end of the season, Odegaard will be a key protagonist in helping them secure it.

     Odegaard: I have not thought about Arsenal captaincy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal midfielder Martin Odegaard has admitted he has not thought about becoming club captain.
Odegaard, despite only joining Arsenal last January, has often been spoken about as a potential club captain.
“No, you know what, I haven’t thought about that (the Arsenal captaincy), to be honest,” Odegaard admitted to Norweigan outlet TV2.
I do my thing, but it’s not important for me.”Though Alexandre Lacazette has primarily captained Arsenal following Aubameyang’s departure, Arteta has spoken previously about Odegaard’s leadership qualities.
I talk to his national team coach and know how highly they speak of him.
