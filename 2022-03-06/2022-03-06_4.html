     I think we went to that “no need to call a time out” well once too often.
Think we needed to get a better shot on that last possession, not to mention several of those last possessions!
If Johnny’s okay so will we be.
We certainly had no answer for Verge!

     Wisconsin men's basketball star Johnny Davis ruled out after flagrant foul by ejected Nebraska player
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     University of Wisconsin sophomore guard Johnny Davis has been ruled out for the rest of the Badgers’ regular-season finale against Nebraska after a collision at the basket.
His foot made contact with Nebraska guard Trey McGowens’ and a foul was called, but Davis continued to the basket to put up a shot.
McGowens attempted a block and missed, but his follow through brought his elbow down forcibly into Davis’ face.
Davis went to the floor and McGowens fell on top of him.
Davis went straight back to the locker room with UW trainers and didn't return to the bench.

1: missed layupsBrad Davison drained a three pointer with 5:48 remaining in the game to give Wisconsin a 71-62 lead.
With 10:54 remaining in the first half, Davis picked up his second foul after he pushed a Nebraska player under the basket out of frustration.
When he came back in at the start of the second half he immediately drew a foul (but missed his first free throw...because he was cold from sitting out???
