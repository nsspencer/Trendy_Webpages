     Wisconsin men's basketball top scorer Johnny Davis injured on flagrant foul in loss to Nebraska Cornhuskers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MADISON, Wis. -- Tenth-ranked Wisconsin lost leading scorer Johnny Davis when he was injured on a flagrant foul early in the second half, and the Badgers missed a chance to clinch the Big Ten title outright by falling to Nebraska 74-73 on Sunday.
Davis was hurt when he was fouled on a layup try by Trey McGowens with 17:32 left.
Davis went to the locker room and didn't return to the bench, and the Badgers said he was out with a lower body injury.
"I'm optimistic that he's going to be fine,'' Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said, without elaborating further on Davis' injury.
I'll leave it at that and I'll watch the replay and I'll make the necessary phone calls," Gard said.

     'Outlander' Season 6 premiere had some big moments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The new season of "Outlander" picked up right where Season 5 left off.
Claire (Caitriona Balfe) had survived a kidnapping and assault, and is back with Jamie (Sam Heughan) but more drama was right around the corner.
The beginning of the episode jumped back to 1753, when Jamie arrives at Ardsmuir prison following the Jacobite uprising.
Governor Harry Quarry (Jay Villiers) allows Jamie to become a freemason and transform the prison to a lodge.
The episode then flashes forward to 1773, where Claire is sleeping in North Carolina but Jamie can't wake her up at first.

     Outlander Season 6: Freemasons and Ether History Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, it should be pointed out that Scottish Freemasons had a different structural hierarchy than their English counterparts.
The episode also did not go into a lot of detail about the beliefs of Freemasons or the organizational hierarchy.
Another appealing reason for joining the Freemasons was that discussions of politics and religion were banned at meetings.
Since this season of Outlander is focused on portraying America before the Revolutionary War, freedom of religion was one of the many issues the colonists had with royal control.
Ether, known to scientists as diethyl ether, was one of the first drugs used for general anaesthesia.

     Will Outlander Get a Season 8?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a prolonged Droughtlander due to the COVID-19 pandemic, season six of Outlander, the beloved time-travel series, is finally here.
But some fans are already thinking way, way ahead.
While the show has been renewed for a seventh season already, it's unclear if there might be a season eight.
And if Starz and Sony are willing, we're willing, and if the actors are willing, we'll keep going."
Outlander's seventh season will presumably focus in on Diana Gabaldon's seventh book in the Outlander series, An Echo in the Bone—so season eight could be an adaptation of her eighth novel, Written in My Own Heart's Blood.

     Two and a half minutes into the second half, Johnny Davis went down.
In his final game in the Kohl Center, Brad Davison put the team on his back when they needed it most, leading the Badger surge in the second half.
The Badgers went ice cold from the field with just under six minutes to play.
Over that period, Nebraska went on a 10-0 run to take a 72-71 lead with 1:50 remaining.
With a chance to tie the game at the line, Hepburn missed the first before making the next two to cut the Nebraska lead to one.

     Outlander Season 6 Premiere Recap Episode 1: Echoes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All of this leads us to Tom Christie.
Mainly, it’s that Tom Christie, also a prisoner at Ardsmuir after Culloden, is a real dick.
It’s a dang shame because Tom Christie is trouble from the start.
Tom Christie agrees his trash son should be punished, but he asks if instead of taking him away, they can just take care of it there.
Just add him to the long list of people on Fraser’s Ridge who we need to be concerned about.
