     'Outlander' Season 6 premiere had some big moments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The new season of "Outlander" picked up right where Season 5 left off.
Claire (Caitriona Balfe) had survived a kidnapping and assault, and is back with Jamie (Sam Heughan) but more drama was right around the corner.
The beginning of the episode jumped back to 1753, when Jamie arrives at Ardsmuir prison following the Jacobite uprising.
Governor Harry Quarry (Jay Villiers) allows Jamie to become a freemason and transform the prison to a lodge.
The episode then flashes forward to 1773, where Claire is sleeping in North Carolina but Jamie can't wake her up at first.

     Outlander Season 6: Freemasons and Ether History Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, it should be pointed out that Scottish Freemasons had a different structural hierarchy than their English counterparts.
The episode also did not go into a lot of detail about the beliefs of Freemasons or the organizational hierarchy.
Another appealing reason for joining the Freemasons was that discussions of politics and religion were banned at meetings.
Since this season of Outlander is focused on portraying America before the Revolutionary War, freedom of religion was one of the many issues the colonists had with royal control.
Ether, known to scientists as diethyl ether, was one of the first drugs used for general anaesthesia.

     Will Outlander Get a Season 8?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a prolonged Droughtlander due to the COVID-19 pandemic, season six of Outlander, the beloved time-travel series, is finally here.
But some fans are already thinking way, way ahead.
While the show has been renewed for a seventh season already, it's unclear if there might be a season eight.
And if Starz and Sony are willing, we're willing, and if the actors are willing, we'll keep going."
Outlander's seventh season will presumably focus in on Diana Gabaldon's seventh book in the Outlander series, An Echo in the Boneâ€”so season eight could be an adaptation of her eighth novel, Written in My Own Heart's Blood.

Mainly, itâ€™s that Tom Christie, also a prisoner at Ardsmuir after Culloden, is a real dick.
Itâ€™s a dang shame because Tom Christie is trouble from the start.
Tom Christie agrees his trash son should be punished, but he asks if instead of taking him away, they can just take care of it there.
Just add him to the long list of people on Fraserâ€™s Ridge who we need to be concerned about.
