     If you don't have the Starz app, the channel is also available with a subscription to Philo (for an extra $9/month) and fuboTV (available for $5/month for the first three months).
While Netflix does not have current seasons on its platform yet, Seasons 1-4 are available to binge with a Netflix subscription in case you need to get caught up on the action.
It's also likely that as soon as Season 6 premieres, Season 5 will be available on the platform as well.

     Outlander Season 6 Premiere Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Outlander's Season 6 premiere arrives Sunday, March 6 on Starz.
Outlander: Season 6 Gallery 17 Images"Echoes" does was an Outlander premiere should do, which is give us peace while signaling dread.
Fraser's Ridge is indeed beset on all sides, and while the new addition of Christie surely foreshadows turbulent times, there are other enemies lurking within: namely addiction.
Claire and Jamie's relationship is still as sweet and otherworldly as ever but it's good that we're shown the aftereffects of Season 5's harrowing ordeal.
The main outside threat here in Season 6 -- aside from the war on the horizon -- was established back in Season 5.

     What to Watch: Outlander finally returns for season 6, ending the longest Droughtlander ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     At last, the longest Droughtlander on record is coming to an end — even if it's a shorter season than fans would like.
Outlander returns for season 6, picking up not long after the events of the brutal season 5 finale, which saw Claire (Caitriona Balfe) kidnapped, gang-raped, and rescued by Jamie (Sam Heughan) and his men.
Meanwhile, Roger (Richard Rankin) and Brianna (Sophie Skelton) must once again try to cope with life in the past after their attempt to return to the future was foiled.
There's no rest for the weary on Fraser's Ridge as season 6 sees the introduction of a host of new settlers, including the brooding Christie family whose patriarch, Tom, has a thorny connection to Jamie and his days in Ardsmuir Prison.
Life in the past is never easy, and the Fraser family must once again face a host of dangers as Outlander returns to Starz.

     Outlander season 6's decision to revisit controversial storyline is essential
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In the finale of Outlander 's fifth season, Claire Fraser (Caitríona Balfe) was abducted from her North Carolina home by a gang of men, led by Lionel Brown (Ned Dennehy), before being beaten and raped.
In particular, as Balfe explained to RadioTimes.com during a Big RT Interview, season 6 takes the time to explore the aftermath of Claire's ordeal.
What Outlander is vividly demonstrating here is that every trauma manifests differently, and every survivor reacts differently.
It's exactly the type of plot line that Outlander does best: nail-biting conflict combined with deep character studies set in a rich, historical setting.
"It's the payoff that I've been waiting for," Heughan said of season 6 when speaking to RadioTimes.com.

     ‘Outlander Season 6, Episode 1 Recap: “Echoes”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     However, Fraser’s Ridge and the territory at large is on the brink of revolution, so it was clear back in the Season 5 finale that safety and relative peace was short-lived.
Quarry deems Christie a “more decent sort” than Jamie but does notice and acknowledge that Jamie holds power among the prisoners.
As basically the entire settlement of Fraser’s Ridge looks on, Jamie does exactly that.
It wouldn’t be an Outlander season premiere if we didn’t have a steamy Claire and Jamie sex scene.
She told Claire in this episode that the baby hasn’t been moving much but that they never do when they’re nearly ready.
