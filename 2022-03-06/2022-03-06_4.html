     Summary: "This weekend we lost the fight for my daughter’s life against depression,” he wrote.
“She is no longer struggling anymore with the universe wanting their angel back."
He also referred to Winona as his "best friend" and a "hero."
No official cause of death has been released yet, and it's unclear whether one will ever be released to the public.
Winona was well known, but she was anonymous enough that her parents may be able to maintain their privacy as they grieve.
