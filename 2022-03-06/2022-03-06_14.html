     Scottie Scheffler Plays It Straight to Win Arnold Palmer Invitational
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO, Fla. — Throughout the final round Sunday at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, it was as if someone were playing a prank on the world’s best golfers.
Simple tasks, like needing fewer than three attempts to sink a putt from one yard away, were suddenly impossible.
Greenside chips were no less wayward, usually long or short but rarely in between.
The players, one after another, were left scratching their heads, stomping their feet in anger or smiling sardonically.
One tour veteran, Matt Jones, simply flung his putter into a pond after one such vexing experience.

     “Yeah, they need to do something about it,” McIlroy said when asked if players should think twice about signing up for future APIs.
“There's a lot of guys that sort of stay away this week to get ready for [the Players Championship] next week.
Or not even less penal when you miss.
I don't mind golf courses being penal when you miss, but it's not rewarding good shots.
I think that's where it starts to get across the line.”

     Scottie Scheffler successfully emerged from a golf tournament so attritional it was worthy of an X-rating.

I’m hitting good shots.

“Meredith obviously knows me better than anybody, being my wife,” Scheffler said later in his press conference.

(1:13)ORLANDO, Fla. -- Scottie Scheffler isn't sure he won the Arnold Palmer Invitational as much as he survived it.
The real heartbreak went to Woodland, trying to win for the first time since the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.
He three-putted the 14th for the first of two straight birdies and closed with three pars for a 72.
The consolation prize for Kirk was earning one of three spots available for The Open at St. Andrews this summer.
