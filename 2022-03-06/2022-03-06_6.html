     Tornadoes Rampage Across Iowa, Killing 7, Officials Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Officials on Sunday were still trying to determine the size of the tornadoes and how far they traveled, but Mr. Krull said the thunderstorm that produced the tornado in Madison County traveled about 180 miles, and two other tornado-producing thunderstorms traveled about 120 miles.
The weather system that produced the thunderstorms in Iowa also produced a tornado near Dunkirk, Wis., southeast of Madison, with wind speeds of 95 miles per hour, said John Gagan, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Milwaukee.
Jonathan Barrett, the choir director at Winterset High School, was checking on family and friends throughout the day.
Roofs had been torn from homes, neighbors were offering their barns to store salvaged belongings, and debris was strewn across streets in the eastern and southern parts of the city, Mr. Barrett said.
The students took shelter in a closet with their parents as the tornado battered their home, said Mr. Barrett, who spoke to members of the family on Saturday night.

     Tornadoes kill 7, including 2 children, near Des Moines, Iowa, officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Seven people, including two children, died in a series of tornadoes that ripped through multiple counties near Des Moines, Iowa, Saturday, officials said.
Six Madison County residents were killed, Madison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said.
It hopes to complete a damage survey for the Winterset tornado on Monday.
The NWS said Sunday the Winterset tornado was one of at least two EF3 tornadoes to hit Iowa on Saturday.
Damage surveys from the NWS offices in Des Moines and Quad Cities suggested another EF3 with estimated winds of 138 mph was responsible for damage near Chariton, it said.

     Officials: 7 killed as tornado tore through central Iowa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     3/6/22DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Seven people were killed, including two children, when a tornado swept through central Iowa, damaging buildings and knocking down trees and power lines, authorities said.
Emergency management officials in Madison County said four were injured and six people were killed Saturday when the tornado touched down in the area southwest of Des Moines at about 4:30 p.m.
Thunderstorms that spawned tornadoes moved through much of Iowa from the afternoon until Saturday night with storms also causing damage in the Des Moines suburb of Norwalk, areas just east of Des Moines and other areas of eastern Iowa.
At one point, power outages affected about 10,000 in the Des Moines area.
It said weather service teams would investigate the damage Sunday and further assess a potential rating.

     Iowa tornado kills seven people, including two children
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Seven people were killed Saturday, including two children under the age of five, when a tornado swept through central Iowa, damaging buildings and knocking down trees and power lines, in the deadliest storm to hit the state since 2008, authorities said.
The storms are the deadliest to occur in Iowa since May 2008 when one tornado destroyed nearly 300 homes and killed nine people in the northern Iowa city of Parkersburg.
Another tornado a month later in the state killed four boys.
Saturday’s storms were not nearly as unusual as the mid-December tornado outbreak that Iowa saw last year, he said.
Power outages affected about 10,000 in the Des Moines area.

     Initial interrogation of photos and videos from around Winterset suggests at least EF3 tornado damage occurred late Saturday afternoon.
— NWS Des Moines (@NWSDesMoines) March 6, 2022Violent winds ripped through an area along Carver Road, roughly three miles outside Winterset.
At 4:03 p.m., “a confirmed tornado was located near Green Valley Lake,” warned the Weather Service in Des Moines.
New video coming in from MyRadar storm chaser @aaronjayjack of the large wedge tornado near Winterset, IA earlier tonight.
Should damage surveys confirm that Saturday’s tornado was stronger than initially estimated, it would be the first EF4 tornado in the state since 2013.
