     Does Winning Time Really Need to Look Like That?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Yet the most immediately striking thing about Winning Time is how it looks.
There are also moments with animation, retro footage, shots that appear to be filmed as home movies, and an overall visual look that evokes the fuzzy appearance of something shot in the late ’70s or ’80s.
What if Winning Time used just this purposely aged look or used just direct-to-camera explanations and asides?
It’s true that Winning Time doesn’t give the viewer a chance to rest, but again, that’s the point.
But I think the makers of Winning Time prioritized making this a visceral experience above all else, and it certainly is that.

     How Jerry Buss, Magic Johnson and the Showtime Lakers created the modern NBA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Brennan: This is Season 1 of “Binge Sesh.”READ MORE &gt;&gt;&gt; Jerry Buss’ obituary: Jerry Buss dies at 80; Lakers owner brought ‘Showtime’ success to L.A.Maddox: I’m Kareem Maddox, resident basketball expert.
I think it indicates why there was an audience for what Jerry Buss and Magic Johnson were about to build with the Lakers.
So Jerry Buss really got in on the ground floor of this massively successful business venture, which is now the modern NBA.
So he’s like, “This is amazing.”I just think Jerry Buss really understood, like, we need to channel this.
Also in a lot of ways, Jerry Buss kind of hitched the fortunes of the franchise to the actions of Magic Johnson.
