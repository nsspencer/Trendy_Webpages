     On Ukraine’s Border, Moldovans Wonder: Where Will Putin Stop?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ON THE DNIESTER RIVER — Just eight miles from the Ukrainian border, the mayor of a village in Moldova watched rolling television coverage of the Russian invasion next door.
“I can’t stop watching,” Mayor Alexander Nikitenko said.
“If they take Odessa, it’s clear they’ll come here next.”And if the Russians do get this far, Mr. Nikitenko wondered, would they necessarily stop?
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has shattered assumptions about the post-Cold War order, providing clear evidence that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sees Europe’s borders as open to being redrawn by force.
A poor country of 2.6 million squeezed between Ukraine and Romania, Moldova is perhaps the most vulnerable.

     Ball Boy Mikel Arteta Assists Classic Arsenal Goal As Young Gunners Shine In Win At Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal's youngsters stole the show in Sunday's 3-2 win at Watford but 39-year-old manager Mikel Arteta also played a key part in one of his side's goals.
What a beautiful goal it was too, with the final three players involved all taking just one touch.
Arteta played the role of ball boy as he quickly fed Bukayo Saka who set Arsenal on the attack with a throw-in to Cedric Soares.
That Martinelli goal made the score 3-1 to Arsenal seven minutes into the second half.
Saka had earlier set up Odegaard for Arsenal's opener, before scoring their second goal himself.

     Moldova seeks US support over Ukraine war refugees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Some 120,000 people have crossed into the small country since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last week.
Moldova’s Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita has called on the United States to increase its humanitarian assistance to the country, as the number of refugees arriving from war-struck Ukraine reached 120,000.
For a small country like Moldova, proportionately, this is a very large number,” Gavrilita told Blinken.
“Everybody has come together to host, to provide shelter, to provide food, to provide assistance to those who are fleeing war,” she said.
Blinken, who is on the third stop of a Europe trip to shore up unity against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said Moldova “can count on us across the board” for support.

     Summary: Get the latest insights about Arsenal straight to your inboxThomas Partey is showing the importance of his experience in the team that is especially helping Granit Xhaka which has been showing in recent games.
The Ghanaian was excellent in the Gunners 3-2 victory over Watford on Sunday afternoon which propelled the club into the top four positions with games in hand still to play.
It wasn’t just Partey’s qualities on the pitch, but it was also his leadership and enforcing in the midfielder that allowed Arsenal to dominate.
His leadership was epitomised when Xhaka was on the verge of getting into a scuffle with Watford’s Imran Louza.
Arsenal were cruising in the leader and Louza became frustrated after Xhaka had failed, which saw him react by aggressively pushing the Arsenal player in the black.

     Summary: Far from the most assured all-round performance against Watford, Arsenal nonetheless turned on the style in an attacking sense with three goals of the highest quality.
Martin Odegaard got the ball rolling at the end of a flowing move with Bukayo Saka, a partnership to rival most of its kind in the Premier League.
Arsenal: 3 negatives from 3-2 win over Watford as Gunners move into Premier League top four with goals from Saka, Odegaard &amp; MartinelliIt’s a win that leave Arsenal one point clear of Manchester United with no less than three fewer matches played, three clear of West Ham in the same circumstances, and six ahead of Tottenham prior to their visit of Everton.
On the long and winding road to the top four, Arsenal are heading in the right direction.
There were too many off days from individual players, which may have sprung from taking their Premier League opponents too lightly.

     U.S. top diplomat Blinken reassures Moldova amid refugee influx from Ukraine

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Olivier Douliery/Pool via REUTERSCHISINAU, Moldova, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday reassured Moldova’s leaders that the United States would rally international opposition to Russian aggression "whenever and wherever" it occurs.
The United States is not committed to defend Moldova since the former Soviet Republic, like its neighbor Ukraine, is not a member of NATO.
The Russian presence, which dates back to Moldova's independence in the early 1990s, is illegal, she said.
Blinken said the United States was providing $18 million over the next few years to "strengthen and diversify" Moldova's energy sector.
"(Energy) independence and energy security is actually critical to maintaining one's sovereignty and independence," Blinken said.

     Arsenal: From bottom of the Premier League to fourth - the changes that sparked revival
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal began this season in crisis mode.
Losing their opening three Premier League games, they sat bottom of the table with zero goals scored and nine conceded.Gradual improvements throughout 2021-22 have seen them climb the table since.The initial focus was on solidifying the back line and then came the attacking thrust from their young stars.
The major difference between then and now comes from the players at Mikel Arteta’s disposal.Pablo Mari, Calum Chambers and Sead Kolasinac played in those opening three games.
Each of them made just two league appearances before their departures.Takehiro Tomiyasu was still at Bologna, Ben White missed two of the three games with COVID-19, Gabriel had not returned from his summer knee injury, while Kieran Tierney was the only one to start all three games.With Aaron Ramsdale in goal, this back four made an immediate impact.
Their first three league games together yielded two clean sheets and one goal conceded.That unit has become more reliable both as a group and as individuals as the season has progressed.Arsenal were conceding chances of higher quality with 1.

(AP Photo/Sergei Grits) (Sergei Grits)CHISINAU, Moldova — (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday pledged America’s support to the small, Western-leaning former Soviet republic of Moldova that is coping with an influx of refugees from Ukraine and warily watching Russia’s intensifying war with its neighbor.
More than 230,000 people have fled into or passed through Moldova from Ukraine since the war began 11 days ago.
“Moldova is a powerful example of a democracy rising to the moment with vision and with determination," Blinken said.

     Arsenal players in line for bonuses of up to £500,000 EACH if they qualify for the Champions League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal's players will be in line for huge lump sum bonuses worth up to £500,000 each if they can get the club back into the Champions League for the first time since 2017.
With Champions League qualification worth at least £50million in prize money and broadcasting revenue to clubs a substantial percentage of that will end up being paid out to the players who have earned it if Arsenal can end their five-year absence.
Arsenal's players will be in line for bonuses worth up to £500,000 if they finish in the top fourA one-off bonus would be due to the squad for finishing in one of the top-four spots which is then divided among Arteta's squad.
Some players are also understood to have clauses separately written into their deals which will see their weekly wages automatically increase for the campaign during which the club are playing in the Champions League group stages.
Reaching next season's Champions League will present Arsenal's players with a further opportunity to increase their income when they can add progress-related bonuses to their schedule agreed ahead of the 2022-23 campaign.

     Arsenal driven by Bukayo Saka-Martin Odegaard combination to boost top-four hopes with win at Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Janusz Michallik is full of praise for Mikel Arteta for how he has turned Arsenal into a team competing for the top-4.
Bukayo Saka scored one and made another as Arsenal claimed a 3-2 win at Watford on Sunday to take another vital step forward in their pursuit of Champions League qualification.
Arsenal's fourth straight Premier League win was inspired by Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard.
The time Arsenal have had to work without European football -- and in their midseason break to Dubai -- is paying off.
The ability of Saka and Odegaard to impact matches is a critical asset for a team still lacking a potent No.

     Watford vs Arsenal live score and result: Latest updates after Martinelli helps Arsenal to 3-2 Premier League win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal moved up into the top four of the Premier League after a 3-2 win against Watford at Vicarage Road.
The Gunners won their fourth game in a row to jump above Manchester United and West Ham in the table thanks to goals from Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli.
Odegaard gave Arsenal the lead after a superb passing move before Cucho Hernandez's stunning overhead kick levelled the scoring for Watford.
Bukayo Saka then regained the lead in the first half for Arsenal with a powerful finish after some great link-up with Alexandre Lacazette.
Moussa Sissoko’s late goal gave Watford hope in stoppage time, but they could not avoid an eighth straight home league defeat.

     Arsenal: How Mikel Arteta has got the Gunners firing towards a Champions League return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's been a few years of toil for Arsenal fans but finally a return to the Champions League is appearing on the horizon as we enter the business end of the season.
Arsenal have won eight of their last 10 Premier League games to storm up the tableNot only could Gunners supporters be dreaming of a first return to the Champions League for the first time since 2017, but they may even become top dogs in London once again too.
Arsenal started the season awfully with three straight defeats without scoring to leave them bottom of the table but Arteta has worked wonders to get them firing again.
Mikel Arteta is starting to get the best out of his squad as they edge towards a top four finishHey, big spenders...
Granted, Arsenal should have been expected to improve having spent so much - but they deserve plenty of credit for spending so well.
