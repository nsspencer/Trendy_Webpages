     On Ukraine’s Border, Moldovans Wonder: Where Will Putin Stop?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ON THE DNIESTER RIVER — Just eight miles from the Ukrainian border, the mayor of a village in Moldova watched rolling television coverage of the Russian invasion next door.
“I can’t stop watching,” Mayor Alexander Nikitenko said.
“If they take Odessa, it’s clear they’ll come here next.”And if the Russians do get this far, Mr. Nikitenko wondered, would they necessarily stop?
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has shattered assumptions about the post-Cold War order, providing clear evidence that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sees Europe’s borders as open to being redrawn by force.
A poor country of 2.6 million squeezed between Ukraine and Romania, Moldova is perhaps the most vulnerable.

     Moldova seeks US support over Ukraine war refugees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Some 120,000 people have crossed into the small country since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last week.
Moldova’s Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita has called on the United States to increase its humanitarian assistance to the country, as the number of refugees arriving from war-struck Ukraine reached 120,000.
For a small country like Moldova, proportionately, this is a very large number,” Gavrilita told Blinken.
“Everybody has come together to host, to provide shelter, to provide food, to provide assistance to those who are fleeing war,” she said.
Blinken, who is on the third stop of a Europe trip to shore up unity against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said Moldova “can count on us across the board” for support.

     Olivier Douliery/Pool via REUTERSCHISINAU, Moldova, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday reassured Moldova’s leaders that the United States would rally international opposition to Russian aggression "whenever and wherever" it occurs.
The United States is not committed to defend Moldova since the former Soviet Republic, like its neighbor Ukraine, is not a member of NATO.
The Russian presence, which dates back to Moldova's independence in the early 1990s, is illegal, she said.
Blinken said the United States was providing $18 million over the next few years to "strengthen and diversify" Moldova's energy sector.
"(Energy) independence and energy security is actually critical to maintaining one's sovereignty and independence," Blinken said.
