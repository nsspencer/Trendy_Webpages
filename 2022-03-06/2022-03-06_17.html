     Courtney Cox Returned to a ‘Friends’ Haunt for Her New Show, ‘Shining Vale’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Courteney Cox returned to familiar territory for her new Starz series: One of the Shining Vale filming locations is the same soundstage where her sitcom Friends once filmed.
The actress pointed out the connection in an August 2021 Instagram video, as she drove tourists past Stage 5 on the Warner Brothers studio lot in Burbank, Calif. “This is where Friends started in 1994 and is now occupied by a show called Shining Vale, starring me,” she said in the clip.

     Shining Vale Season 1 E01 &amp; E02 Bleed Horrifying Potential: Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shining Vale Season 1 E01 &amp; E02 Bleed Horrifying Potential: ReviewOn March 6th, Starz' Shining Vale premiered the first two episodes of the horror-comedy series starring Courteney Cox and Greg Kinnear.
Shining Vale takes you to an odd place, but for some reason, you want to stay there and take some time.
With the reflection of iconic horror and honoring of the odd and absurd TV shows before it, Shining Vale succeeds.
Not a perfect series, but Shining Vale has a lot of potential in its veins and I'm excited for what's next.

     Starz's Shining Vale Premiere: Grade It!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Demons of the literal and figurative variety plague Courteney Cox’s Pat during Shining Vale‘s two-episode premiere — but strangely, it’s the metaphorical ones that appear to be wreaking more havoc.
In the wake of Pat’s fling with the handyman, she and Terry have moved their family from Brooklyn to Shining Vale, Conn., in hopes of finding a fresh start there.
And perhaps most worrying is the eerie presence of another Shining Vale resident who looks terrified every time Pat encounters her.
Please be careful,” the woman attempts to warn Pat, but Pat can hardly hear her from across the street.
