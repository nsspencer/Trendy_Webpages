    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EAST LANSING – Nothing has come easy for this Michigan State basketball team, right down to the end of the regular season.
The Spartans nearly blew a 20-point second-half lead before pulling out a 77-67 win over Maryland on Sunday on senior day at the Breslin Center.
The win gives Michigan State (20-11, 11-9) the No.
For most of the day, Michigan State seemed to have broken through to at last record a convincing win.
That stretch kicked off a 46-point first half that gave Michigan State a 20-point lead at the break.

     Michigan State holds off Maryland rally to win regular-season finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a rare sharp start, Sunday’s regular-season finale against Maryland devolved into the kind of familiar stressful, stomach-twisting affair these Spartans have become known for.
Maryland’s assault got the Terrapins as close as three at the 7:14 mark, and, fittingly, senior wing Gabe Brown turned the Terrapins back with seven straight points.
The Spartans didn’t initially sprint away amid Maryland’s anemic start, enduring a mini slump of seven straight misses before getting back on track.
Brown took the wheel from there with his string of seven points, and Hall scored seven points over the span of two-and-a-half minutes to keep the Terrapins at arm’s length.
