     Rutgers men's basketball earns No. 4 seed for Big Ten Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Following a win over Penn State on Sunday and a little help from from other teams, Rutgers secured its highest finish in the league standings and its best seed since joining the conference 2014.
The Rutgers men's basketball team is seeded fourth for the Big Ten Tournament.
Michigan defeated Ohio State shortly after Rutgers' contest wrapped up and Illinois defeated Iowa tonight leaving the Scarlet Knights, Buckeyes, and Hawkeyes with 12-8 marks in Big Ten play.
Rutgers owned the tiebreaker since it defeated both Ohio State and Iowa the one time it played those teams each.
The Big Ten Tournament runs March 9-13 from Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, IN.

     Gameday point spread for Penn State men's basketball road game at Rutgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     According to the gameday odds provided by Tipico, Penn State is a 5.5-point underdog in Piscataway on Sunday afternoon against the Scarlet Knights.
After dropping a competitive game at Illinois on Thursday, Penn State is now just 1-9 on the road this season in true road games.
Although Penn State did get the best of Rutgers in their previous meeting this season, that game was played in Happy Valley, where Penn State has been far more consistent outside of their home finale against Nebraska.
Both Rutgers and Penn State are playing for Big Ten tournament seeding as the conference tournament gets underway this week.

     Rutgers eyes most important thing on emotional Senior Day: A win over Penn State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The scene is set for Sunday to be one of the greatest days in Rutgers basketball history.
It is not a given that the Scarlet Knights will run over their visitors.
Penn State romped Rutgers (17-12, 11-8) when the two teams faced off in State College in January, the Nittany Lions leading from wire-to-wire and dominating the Scarlet Knights in multiple areas.
It is a chance for one of the greatest generations of Scarlet Knights to put a stamp on their historic run.
A win over Penn State would ensure it will be remembered for all the right reasons.

     The Rutgers men’s basketball team defeated Penn State 59-58 on an emotional Senior Day at Jersey Mike’s Arena on Livingston campus.
Harper gave Rutgers the lead for good with a free throw with 1:41 remaining, but Penn State would have its fair share of chances to steal a Senior Day win.
(Penn State has) a really good basketball team.
The Rutgers defense made the Nittany Lions work for every basket all afternoon as Penn State finished shooting 32.1 percent and 25 percent from three.
“My hope one day is to make Penn State the same exact way.

     Ron Harper Jr. defends Penn State’s Sam Sessoms during Rutgers’ win on March 6, 2022.
“I’m almost envious,” Penn State coach Micah Shrewsberry said.
“My hope for one day is to make Penn State the same exact way.
But the Scarlet Knights found a way, as they have so often over the last three years, in part because they held Penn State to 32 percent shooting from the field.
It forced another after the under-four minute timeout after Penn State had cut a 15-point deficit down to seven.
