     'SNL:' Kate McKinnon blasts Florida bill about sexual orientation talk in schools

     Summary: 1/4Kate McKinnon condemned on "SNL" a Florida bill that would ban discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools in grades K-3.
Now on its way to the Florida Senate, the measure critics are calling the "don't say gay" bill bans discussions in grades K-3.
It just feels like this will make kids gay and trans.
"Does this 'don't say gay' law have a purpose?"
"I guess it's so kids don't go home with questions parents don't want to answer," Jost said.

     Rapid Recap: Bucks 132, Suns 122
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In an NBA Finals rematch, the Bucks would pull off a comeback win thanks to 44 points from Khris Middleton.
The Suns would open up their lead by as much as ten in the second quarter, but the Bucks would answer nicely.
A 3-pointer from Khris Middleton to close out the period sliced Phoenix’s lead to just three going into halftime.
That was largely due to Khris Middleton, who sat at 28 points through three quarters.
Stat That Stood OutI could obviously go with Khris Middleton, but I’ll talk about that in my Extended Recap.

     Summary: During "Saturday Night Live"'s Weekend Update, cast member Kate McKinnon took on Florida's controversial "Don't Say Gay" bill, saying it might actually be a good thing.
"When I was in middle school, in the '90s, I was kind of tortured by the constant use of the word 'gay,'" explained McKinnon, who herself identifies as an openly gay person.
"I am deeply gay.
Sorry, concerned.
Deeply concerned," she responded.

     Khris Middleton reminds everyone of his importance to Bucks with season-high 44 points in win over Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Bucks would have to play the final minute-plus without their two-time MVP, and were clinging to a five-point lead.
It could have been a nervy finish, but the Bucks still had Khris Middleton.
Middleton finished with a season-high 44 points, eight rebounds and five assists on the day, as the Bucks took down the Suns in a Finals rematch, 132-122.
It was fitting that Middleton's best game of the season came against the Suns in a national TV showcase.
Giannis runs the show, but the Bucks aren't the Bucks without Middleton, and he made that crystal clear again on Sunday.

     Khris Middleton Scores 44 Points, Bucks Rally to Beat Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     By STEVE MEGARGEE, AP Sports WriterMILWAUKEE (AP) — Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday made sure the Milwaukee Bucks withstood Giannis Antetokounmpo’s foul trouble and got through arguably the toughest three-game stretch of their schedule unscathed.
Middleton scored a season-high 44 points, Holiday had 24 and the Bucks rallied to beat the short-handed Phoenix Suns 132-122 on Sunday for their fourth consecutive victory.
Holiday scored 17 points and Middleton had 16 in the fourth quarter to help the Bucks outscore the Suns 12-1 over the last three minutes.
But the Bucks outscored the Suns 18-11 in the four-plus minutes Antetokounmpo missed and owned a 120-118 lead when the two-time MVP returned with 3:23 remaining.
Holiday and Middleton combined for 16 of the Bucks' 18 points during that stretch.

Another one of these contentious subjects was the Parental Rights in Education bill, most commonly known (especially by dissidents) as the 'Don't Say Gay' bill.
To discuss it, SNL regular Kate McKinnon joined Jost and, of course, injected ironic humor into the situation.
McKinnon was welcomed to the Update desk while being showered by the warm cheers and applause of the live audience.
However, the 'Don't Say Gay' bill is not devised to prevent the word from being used as an insult in schools.

She continued, “If the ’90s were right, and ‘gay’ means ‘bad,’ then this is the gayest law I have ever seen,” before encouraging the audience to sing “gay” instead, as she begins singing “gay, gay, gay” to the beat of Deep Purple’s “Smoke on the Water.”Fans and celebrities quickly took to social media to celebrate McKinnon’s rant and to condemn the bill, including last month’s host Ariana DeBose:“If you can’t say it you might as well sing it.”- Kate McKinnonCue me: Belting from the rafters 🗣🏳️‍🌈 GAY GAY GAY, GAY, GAY GAY GAY.
