     Samuel L. Jackson to Marvel critics: "All movies are valid"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Samuel L. Jackson has responded to recent criticisms of movies produced by Marvel Studios.
Specifically, Jackson makes a counterpoint to the arguments from fellow cinema legends like Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese, who have described the studio’s films as “prototypes” and “theme park rides”, respectively.
“All movies are valid,” Jackson said in an interview with The Times.
“They should have an Oscar for the most popular movie,” Jackson explained.
However, internet campaigns took advantage of the unclear parameters for the award and took hold, with films like 2001’s Shrek being early leaders in the contest.

     To play the role, Fishback wrote a journal for her character and shared it with Mosley and Jackson.
“I wanted to really bring Robyn from the book to the series as much as we could,” she says.
It was a huge collaboration with both of them, so I was really thankful.”Jackson, meanwhile, chose a different approach.
“It’s a fairy tale,” Mosley says.
“But a dark fairy tale in more ways than one.”

     ‘The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey’ review: Samuel L. Jackson stars in a tale of secrets and buried treasure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For a conspicuously busy superstar such as Samuel L. Jackson, the six-part Apple TV+ adaptation of Walter Mosley’s “The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey” demanded his largest, deepest commitment to a role in a long time.
Jackson serves as executive producer and star of “Ptolemy Grey,” which is based on the 2010 novel from the author made famous by the Easy Rawlins mysteries.
A lot of what’s best about “Ptolemy Grey” is pretty simple and consistently rewarding: the interplay between Jackson and Dominique Fishback, who plays the teenage caregiver of the title character.
Much of Grey’s long life doesn’t make the cut here in limited series form.
At its best “Ptolemy Grey” lets the audience know it’s listening to a writer with a singular ear for vernacular, and dramatic poetry.

     Samuel L. Jackson Said He Should Have Won An Academy Award By Now
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jackson currently has no Oscar awards and was nominated only once for his role in a 1995 movie.
Despite appearing in several high-grossing movies, he has never won an Academy Award.
However, in the next award ceremony, the Academy revealed that the actor would be given an honorary award for his outstanding work in the acting industry.
Jackson Hasn’t Won An Oscar BeforeDespite being one of the most reputable actors in Hollywood, Jackson hasn’t won an Academy Award before.
In a recent interview, the “Shank” actor talked about his lack of an Oscar and told the Academy Award voters that he was long overdue for the honor.

     The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey Review: A Strong Hook That Fails to Dig Deep Enough
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As adapted by Walter Mosley from his own novel, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey opens with a fascinating hook.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey primarily centers Ptolemy’s attempts to set his affairs in order while growing fond of his new caretaker, a 17-year-old girl named Robyn (Dominique Fishback).
Yet, while the man can recall his entire life without a hitch, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey remains curiously limited in what it chooses to depict.
But in focusing so little on those aspects of Ptolemy’s life, it offers up a character that feels as incomplete as the actions he undertakes.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey starts strong but, by failing to probe further into its protagonist’s life, its main character only grows thinner as the story progresses.
