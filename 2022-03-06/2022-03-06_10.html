At least 364 Ukrainians have died since Russia invaded Ukraine and at least 759 have been injured, according to the United Nations.
Western powers are in talks about a ban on Russian oil and gas imports.
The Biden administration fears what that could mean for gas prices, but an energy imports ban would also deprive Russia of a large source of revenue.

     Ukrainian servicemen help an elderly woman, in the town of Irpin, Ukraine, on March 6.
(Andriy Dubchak/AP)Video has surfaced showing the moment a Russian military strike killed a family in Irpin, Ukraine, a town on the western outskirts of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.
Irpin has been the site of intense shelling by the Russian military in recent days.
CNN has determined the civilians were killed in the Russian military strike seen in the video.
Civilian bodies are covered by sheets in Irpin, killed by Russian forces after being hit by a mortar while trying to flee Ukraine on March 6.

     But larger and more legally questionable transactions are unlikely, according to experts.
There is “no evidence of large-scale attempts at sanctions evasion,” she said.
Massive crypto trades require high levels of energy and computer processing, and there simply is not enough to support a Russian financial system that the U.S. Treasury Department says normally trades some $46 billion daily.
Because all cryptocurrency transactions take place on one of multiple blockchains — a digital ledger of sorts — they’re visible to regulators.
While blockchains are massive (and arcane) and can’t be monitored at all times, frequent large-scale transactions are unlikely to escape detection.

“They are our relatives, they’re the closest people we have, and this is not about them,” he said.
I’m angry about the Russian propaganda.
“The easiest thing to do would be to say, ‘OK, now I don’t have a father,’” he said.
After a post on Instagram complaining about his father’s disbelief went viral, he launched a website, papapover.com, which means “Papa, believe,” with instructions for Ukrainians about how to speak to their family members about the war.

     Fighting traps residents in Mariupol; Putin calls on Ukraine to surrender
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Macron told Putin he was concerned about a possible amphibious attack on Ukraine's historic port city of Odessa, Macron's office said.
The U.S. defense official estimated that Russia has deployed about 95% of the combat forces it had staged outside Ukraine.
In the capital, Ukrainian soldiers bolstered defences by digging trenches, blocking roads and liaising with civil defence units as Russian forces bombarded areas nearby.
Russian forces opened fire at a protest against their occupation of the southern Ukrainian city of Nova Kakhovka on Sunday, wounding five people, Ukrainian news agency Interfax Ukraine said, citing eyewitnesses.
Putin says he wants a "demilitarised", "denazified" and neutral Ukraine, and on Saturday likened Western sanctions "to a declaration of war".

     Why Vladimir Putin is losing the information war to Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With Putin’s Ukraine invasion still less than two weeks old, it is already clear that the information war has been decisively lost.
After years of success, why is Putin now losing the information war so comprehensively?
Dramatic recent improvements in international media coverage of Ukraine are only part of the reason behind Russia’s resounding information war defeat.
If Zelenskyy is the undoubted star of Ukraine’s information war effort, other Ukrainian officials have also performed excellently.

     Russia-Ukraine war: Vladimir Putin’s ultimate goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     RALEIGH, N.C. — As the war in Ukraine continues, all eyes are on Russia’s next steps and the country’s ultimate goal behind the invasion.
To provide insight, Spectrum News 1 spoke with Daniel Hamilton, a senior fellow of foreign affairs at Johns Hopkins University.
Both the White House and U.S. senators, like Marco Rubio, have made statements, appearing to question Putin’s mental health after two years of pandemic isolation.
“How could anybody really logically think, even Putin, think that he will get away with this.
Hamilton also pointed out that Putin, being 69 years old, may be considering the legacy he will leave behind.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Police detained more than 4,300 people on Sunday at Russia-wide protests against President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to an independent protest monitoring group.
Thousands of protesters chanted “No to war!” and “Shame on you!”, according to videos posted on social media by opposition activists and bloggers.
Jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny had called for protests on Sunday across Russia and the rest of the world against the invasion.
“Because of Putin, Russia now means war for many people,” Navalny said on Friday.
Putin’s approval ratings have jumped in Russia since the invasion, according to Moscow-based pollsters.
