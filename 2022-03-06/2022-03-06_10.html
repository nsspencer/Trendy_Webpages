     Summary: Known as the Parental Rights in Education bill but coined the "Don't Say Gay" bill by critics, the controversial legislation would allow parents greater authority to take legal action against school districts that violate the bill.
McKinnon called the bill "unconscionable," but only after Weekend Update co-anchor Colin Jost cleared up some misconceptions.

     Kate McKinnon slams Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' bill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Known as the Parental Rights in Education bill but coined the "Don't Say Gay" bill by critics, the controversial legislation would allow parents greater authority to take legal action against school districts that violate the bill.
McKinnon called the bill "unconscionable," but only after Weekend Update co-anchor Colin Jost cleared up some misconceptions.

It's just that thing of when they say, 'Don't say gay,' then it's stuck in your head.
Like, does this 'Don't Say Gay' law have a purpose?"

     'SNL': Kate McKinnon Takes on Florida's "Don't Say Gay" Bill During Weekend Update
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This weekend's Saturday Night Live episode featured the evergreen Weekend Update segment, hosted by Colin Jost and Michael Che.
Another one of these contentious subjects was the Parental Rights in Education bill, most commonly known (especially by dissidents) as the 'Don't Say Gay' bill.
To discuss it, SNL regular Kate McKinnon joined Jost and, of course, injected ironic humor into the situation.
McKinnon was welcomed to the Update desk while being showered by the warm cheers and applause of the live audience.
However, the 'Don't Say Gay' bill is not devised to prevent the word from being used as an insult in schools.

     Kate McKinnon Roasts Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ Bill on ‘SNL’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SNL all-star Kate McKinnon joined Colin Jost on Weekend Update to discuss Florida’s hateful and cruel “Don’t Say Gay” bill that just passed in the state’s House of Representatives.
She continued, “If the ’90s were right, and ‘gay’ means ‘bad,’ then this is the gayest law I have ever seen,” before encouraging the audience to sing “gay” instead, as she begins singing “gay, gay, gay” to the beat of Deep Purple’s “Smoke on the Water.”Fans and celebrities quickly took to social media to celebrate McKinnon’s rant and to condemn the bill, including last month’s host Ariana DeBose:“If you can’t say it you might as well sing it.”- Kate McKinnonCue me: Belting from the rafters 🗣🏳️‍🌈 GAY GAY GAY, GAY, GAY GAY GAY.
