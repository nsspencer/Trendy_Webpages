     French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin (Getty Images)French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power plants Sunday, according to a Kremlin readout of the call between the two leaders.
"The physical and nuclear safety of the plant is well protected," the readout said.
The statement also noted Russian Armed Forces "control the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant" to ensure there are no "provocations fraught with catastrophic consequences by Ukrainian neo-Nazis or terrorists."
Putin accused Ukraine of not fulfilling "the agreements reached on such an acute humanitarian issue."
The Kremlin readout also said "Ukrainian nationalists did not allow the evacuation from these cities.

     What Happened on Day 10 of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Footage verified by The New York Times and interviews with residents point to the growing humanitarian crisis in a key port city in southern Ukraine.
Staggered by blasts pummeling the city, cut off from heat through freezing nights, and running low on food and water, the people of Mariupol, Ukraine, have been trapped by Russia’s siege.
In interviews, residents and local officials in Mariupol, a port on the Sea of Azov, described nightmarish conditions after five days of shelling by Russian forces around the city.
On Sunday, city officials said they would attempt to resume an evacuation effort that was called off a day earlier because of Russian attacks.
“There was no cease-fire for the whole length of the corridor and Russian troops continued to attack our positions,” he said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     More than 1.5 million refugees from Ukraine have fled to neighboring countries over the past 10 days, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said Sunday.
Grandi later said that if that if the exodus from Ukraine continues, other countries outside Europe may need to increase their role.
The 1.5 million number is “difficult enough to manage even for relatively stable and prosperous countries in Europe.
“Up to now we have not succeeded in getting the necessary guarantees and respect for the cease-fire,” Grandi said.
“There is bombardment by the Russian forces.”He called such a cease-fire the only way for convoys to get supplies in and refugees out.

     On Ukraine’s Border, Moldovans Wonder: Where Will Putin Stop?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ON THE DNIESTER RIVER — Just eight miles from the Ukrainian border, the mayor of a village in Moldova watched rolling television coverage of the Russian invasion next door.
“I can’t stop watching,” Mayor Alexander Nikitenko said.
“If they take Odessa, it’s clear they’ll come here next.”And if the Russians do get this far, Mr. Nikitenko wondered, would they necessarily stop?
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has shattered assumptions about the post-Cold War order, providing clear evidence that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sees Europe’s borders as open to being redrawn by force.
A poor country of 2.6 million squeezed between Ukraine and Romania, Moldova is perhaps the most vulnerable.

     In reality, more than 350 civilians had died as of Saturday night, according to the United Nations.
“It’s not that they don’t believe it is happening, but they think that the high-level politicians should figure it out,” said Svetlana, who was uncomfortable providing her last name.
“I tell them that we are people too, and this has affected us,” she said.
“I asked them not to hide their heads in the sand, I asked the mothers to think about not sending their sons to the army.
It was not the response she had hoped for — no recognition of the gravity of the situation for Ukrainians or sympathy for the loss of human life.

     Putin told Erdogan he was ready for dialogue with Ukraine and foreign partners but any attempt to draw out negotiation would fail, a Kremlin statement said.
Macron told Putin he was concerned about a possible imminent attack on southern Ukraine's historic port city of Odessa, Macron's office said.
Putin says he wants a "demilitarised", "denazified" and neutral Ukraine, and on Saturday likened Western sanctions "to a declaration of war".
The United Nations said over 1.5 million had fled in Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since World War Two.
In the last 36 hours alone, he said, Ukraine had lost 11 combat aircraft and two helicopters.

     Why Vladimir Putin is losing the information war to Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With Putin’s Ukraine invasion still less than two weeks old, it is already clear that the information war has been decisively lost.
After years of success, why is Putin now losing the information war so comprehensively?
Dramatic recent improvements in international media coverage of Ukraine are only part of the reason behind Russia’s resounding information war defeat.
If Zelenskyy is the undoubted star of Ukraine’s information war effort, other Ukrainian officials have also performed excellently.

     Police detained more than 4,300 people on Sunday at Russia-wide protests against President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to an independent protest monitoring group.
Thousands of protesters chanted “No to war!” and “Shame on you!”, according to videos posted on social media by opposition activists and bloggers.
Jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny had called for protests on Sunday across Russia and the rest of the world against the invasion.
“Because of Putin, Russia now means war for many people,” Navalny said on Friday.
Putin’s approval ratings have jumped in Russia since the invasion, according to Moscow-based pollsters.

     Russia-Ukraine war: Vladimir Putin’s ultimate goal

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     RALEIGH, N.C. — As the war in Ukraine continues, all eyes are on Russia’s next steps and the country’s ultimate goal behind the invasion.
To provide insight, Spectrum News 1 spoke with Daniel Hamilton, a senior fellow of foreign affairs at Johns Hopkins University.
Both the White House and U.S. senators, like Marco Rubio, have made statements, appearing to question Putin’s mental health after two years of pandemic isolation.
“How could anybody really logically think, even Putin, think that he will get away with this.
Hamilton also pointed out that Putin, being 69 years old, may be considering the legacy he will leave behind.
