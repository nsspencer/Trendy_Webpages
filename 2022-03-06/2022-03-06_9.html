     'Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty' review: HBO's nostalgic miniseries doesn't conjure much magic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) The equivalent of missing what should be an easy layup, "Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty" stumbles on the road to greatness, undermining can't-miss subject matter for basketball fans with an uneven, at times farcical tone.
Although '80s-style excess clearly accounts for much of the sizzle, this exercise feels like a no-look pass that skips out of bounds.
Produced by "Don't Look Up's" Adam McKay (who also directed the first episode), and based on Jeff Pearlman's book about the period, the 10-episode series focuses on the first season in which new owner Jerry Buss (John C. Reilly) drafted rookie phenom Earvin "Magic" Johnson (standout newcomer Quincy Isaiah), winning the first of five NBA titles in a decade.
In addition to their passion for basketball, the late Buss and Johnson (who has notably disavowed the project ) shared a playboy lifestyle, while transforming the Forum, where the Lakers played their games, into the hottest ticket in town.
Still, "Winning Time" feels too cute for its own good, especially in the early going, when characters keep breaking the fourth wall to chat directly with the audience, and everyone but Buss and Magic appears to be kind of jerk.

     Showtime on HBO – Star-Studded Series ‘Winning Time’ Takes on Magic’s, Kareem’s Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Quincy Isaiah, left, as Magic Johnson, and Solomon Hughes as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
The series also will be available to stream on HBO Max.
Unlike the much-heralded “The Last Dance,” the ESPN documentary about Michael Jordan, “Winning Time” employs established actors and newcomers to tell the Lakers’ story.
The series is based on the 2014 book, “Showtime: Magic, Kareem, Riley and the Los Angeles Lakers Dynasty of the 1980s” by Jeff Pearlman.
“It was crazy, and to this day, I can’t believe Quincy and Dr. Hughes came our way,” McKay said.

     True Story of Jerry Buss Deserves Over the Top Treatment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Winning Time, which stars the likes of John C. Reilly as the late Lakers czar Jerry Buss, and Jason Clarke as a wound-extremely-tight Jerry West, adds a little Adam McKay (who produces the series) flair to the historical record.
Jerry West fucking and shitting and goddamning everyone he crosses.
You can't forget, of course, Jerry Buss waltzing around like Hugh Hefner's long-lost brother.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar added, “the story of the Showtime Lakers is best told by those who actually lived through it.” (No comment yet from Jeanie Buss, the current Los Angeles Lakers owner and daughter of Jerry.)
Jerry West would've just been a short-tempered boardroom presence.

     HBO’s Lakers Show Has an Adam McKay Problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Winning Time starts off promisingly, with a cold open set in 1991 as Lakers star Magic Johnson receives his HIV diagnosis.
Winning Time’s first episode was directed by Adam McKay, who also serves as an executive producer on the series.
For a series about one of the most famous basketball teams in history, Winning Time shows remarkably little actual basketball.
(Ferrell had wanted to play Buss, and was hurt when McKay went instead for Reilly, who’s Ferrell’s best friend.)
Winning Time evokes an iconic moment in Lakers history, just not the one it wants to.

     ‘Winning Time’ Recap: When Magic Met Jerry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Magic had just been diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, which at the time was a death sentence.
In some ways, Jerry and Magic are two very different men.
The Jerry scenes are a delight, and “The Swan” smartly contrasts him with the old-money arrogance of Cooke (played by Michael O’Keefe).
Lakers coach Jerry West thinks Magic is too tall to play point guard, even though the kid just helped win a college national championship at that position.
Warrick Page/HBOIt is not a spoiler to say this will be far from the last time either Jerry or Magic will get to party on and around this court.

     How Jerry Buss, Magic Johnson and the Showtime Lakers created the modern NBA

     Brennan: This is Season 1 of “Binge Sesh.”READ MORE &gt;&gt;&gt; Jerry Buss’ obituary: Jerry Buss dies at 80; Lakers owner brought ‘Showtime’ success to L.A.Maddox: I’m Kareem Maddox, resident basketball expert.
I think it indicates why there was an audience for what Jerry Buss and Magic Johnson were about to build with the Lakers.
So Jerry Buss really got in on the ground floor of this massively successful business venture, which is now the modern NBA.
So he’s like, “This is amazing.”I just think Jerry Buss really understood, like, we need to channel this.
Also in a lot of ways, Jerry Buss kind of hitched the fortunes of the franchise to the actions of Magic Johnson.
