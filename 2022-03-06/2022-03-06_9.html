     INDIANAPOLIS — Familiarity flowed from every angle of Sunday's Big Ten Tournament title game, which served as the third Iowa-Indiana clash in the last 16 days.
Iowa gutted its way to a second Big Ten Tournament title in the last four years, upending Indiana, 74-67, in Sunday's championship game at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.
"We all really knew personnel going into it, said Czinano, who was elected to the all Big Ten Tournament team alongside Clark.
Sunday's win, coupled with the Big Ten regular-season title acquired last weekend, accentuates Iowa's climb back to the level it hoped to be operating at this postseason.
