     Ball Boy Mikel Arteta Assists Classic Arsenal Goal As Young Gunners Shine In Win At Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal's youngsters stole the show in Sunday's 3-2 win at Watford but 39-year-old manager Mikel Arteta also played a key part in one of his side's goals.
What a beautiful goal it was too, with the final three players involved all taking just one touch.
Arteta played the role of ball boy as he quickly fed Bukayo Saka who set Arsenal on the attack with a throw-in to Cedric Soares.
That Martinelli goal made the score 3-1 to Arsenal seven minutes into the second half.
Saka had earlier set up Odegaard for Arsenal's opener, before scoring their second goal himself.

     Watford vs Arsenal live score and result: Latest updates after Martinelli helps Arsenal to 3-2 Premier League win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal moved up into the top four of the Premier League after a 3-2 win against Watford at Vicarage Road.
The Gunners won their fourth game in a row to jump above Manchester United and West Ham in the table thanks to goals from Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli.
Odegaard gave Arsenal the lead after a superb passing move before Cucho Hernandez's stunning overhead kick levelled the scoring for Watford.
Bukayo Saka then regained the lead in the first half for Arsenal with a powerful finish after some great link-up with Alexandre Lacazette.
Moussa Sissoko’s late goal gave Watford hope in stoppage time, but they could not avoid an eighth straight home league defeat.

We restored our lead before half time with a clinical finish from Bukayo Saka, and made it three when Gabriel Martinelli slotted the ball high into the roof of the net.

     Mikel Arteta sounds off on Alexandre Lacazette’s Arsenal future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has claimed that the club will evaluate forward Alexandre Lacazette’s future with the Gunners at the end of the season.
In speaking following Arsenal’s 3-2 Premier League away win over Watford, Arteta was asked whether he would want to keep the soon-to-be free agent at the club.
The Arsenal manager later mentioned in October that “anything is possible” regarding the Frenchman’s contract status.
While Lacazette has not been chipping in with goals as of late, Arteta is much pleased to see the French talent emerge as a playmaker within the team.
Next up for Arsenal will be a key league home clash against Leicester City.

     Janusz Michallik is full of praise for Mikel Arteta for how he has turned Arsenal into a team competing for the top-4.
Bukayo Saka scored one and made another as Arsenal claimed a 3-2 win at Watford on Sunday to take another vital step forward in their pursuit of Champions League qualification.
Arsenal's fourth straight Premier League win was inspired by Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard.
The time Arsenal have had to work without European football -- and in their midseason break to Dubai -- is paying off.
The ability of Saka and Odegaard to impact matches is a critical asset for a team still lacking a potent No.

     Arsenal: Arsene Wenger says Bukayo Saka's penalty miss at Euro 2020 was 'great for his career'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta claimed Bukayo Saka's penalty miss at Euro 2020 was 'great for his career' after the England international scored one goal and set up another in the 3-2 win at Watford.
The Arsenal academy graduate then restored his side's advantage after a well-worked one-two with Alexandre Lacazette, before Gabriel Martinelli added a third.
Saka missed the decisive spot-kick during England's agonising Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy at Wembley then suffered racist abuse online, along with Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford, who also missed penalties.
Saka was subject to racial abuse after the Euro 2020 final before the footballing world showed their support to himArteta believes Saka, who has enjoyed an impressive season so far, is better for the experience.
And what you learn from those difficult moments is much more probably than if you had scored that goal.'
