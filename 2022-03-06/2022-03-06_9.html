     Here's What Giannis Antetokounmpo Said After The Bucks Beat The Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Phoenix Suns 132-122 on Sunday afternoon in Wisconsin, and after the game the 2021 NBA Finals MVP spoke to reporters.
"Obviously we have the hardest schedule left," Antetokounmpo said after the Bucks beat the Suns.
Who's gonna set the screens?
Antetokounmpo had 19 points, 13 rebounds and six assists in the win, and the Bucks advanced to 40-25 on the season.
The two teams faced off in the NBA Finals last season, and the Bucks won the series in six games to win the NBA Championship.

     3 big takeaways from Milwaukee Bucks sweeping tough 3 game stretch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They weren’t all pretty, but the Bucks pulled out three wins over the Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls, and Phoenix Suns.
The other common denominator here was that the Bucks took over late in those games to come out with the win.
For all the mistakes and sloppy play that plagued the Bucks through these games, they found a way to pull these games out.
A lot of the credit needs to go to the big three and especially so after the Suns game where Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday took over in the fourth quarter while Giannis Antetokounmpo struggled with foul trouble.
The start of these games were familiar scenarios for the Bucks after some reckless turnovers, bad shot selection, and lazy defense.

     Milwaukee Bucks get 3 statement wins to start March
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsThe Milwaukee Bucks seemed to be at a low point after losing to the Brooklyn Nets on February 26th.
Flip the calendar to March, and the Milwaukee Bucks are riding high after beating the Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls, and the Phoenix Suns.
The Milwaukee Bucks proved to the Eastern Conference’s best, the Miami Heat, that Milwaukee is not ready to cede conference control over just yet.
Against the Chicago Bulls, it was Giannis who scored 34 points to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to victory.
The Milwaukee Bucks need to overcome two big problems if they hope to make more winning statements come playoff time.

     Milwaukee vs. Phoenix: Bucks Block Out Suns, 132-122
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In an NBA Finals rematch, the Bucks were able to come from behind and knock off the visiting Phoenix Suns, 132-122.
A 3-pointer from Khris Middleton with 0.5 seconds left put them down by just several points going into the locker room.
Khris Middleton would really start to come alive for the Bucks, as he had 28 points through the first three.
Bonus Bucks BitsWith yesterday’s win, the Bucks are now 3-0 vs. the Heat, Bulls, and Suns.
Should the Bucks meet Phoenix again later in the season, the Bucks will be hopeful that they have Brook Lopez with them.

     Khris Middleton Scores 44 Points, Bucks Rally to Beat Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By STEVE MEGARGEE, AP Sports WriterMILWAUKEE (AP) — Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday made sure the Milwaukee Bucks withstood Giannis Antetokounmpo’s foul trouble and got through arguably the toughest three-game stretch of their schedule unscathed.
Middleton scored a season-high 44 points, Holiday had 24 and the Bucks rallied to beat the short-handed Phoenix Suns 132-122 on Sunday for their fourth consecutive victory.
Holiday scored 17 points and Middleton had 16 in the fourth quarter to help the Bucks outscore the Suns 12-1 over the last three minutes.
But the Bucks outscored the Suns 18-11 in the four-plus minutes Antetokounmpo missed and owned a 120-118 lead when the two-time MVP returned with 3:23 remaining.
Holiday and Middleton combined for 16 of the Bucks' 18 points during that stretch.
