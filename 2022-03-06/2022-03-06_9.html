     Tornadoes Rampage Across Iowa, Killing 7, Officials Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Officials on Sunday were still trying to determine the size of the tornadoes and how far they traveled, but Mr. Krull said the thunderstorm that produced the tornado in Madison County traveled about 180 miles, and two other tornado-producing thunderstorms traveled about 120 miles.
The weather system that produced the thunderstorms in Iowa also produced a tornado near Dunkirk, Wis., southeast of Madison, with wind speeds of 95 miles per hour, said John Gagan, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Milwaukee.
Jonathan Barrett, the choir director at Winterset High School, was checking on family and friends throughout the day.
Roofs had been torn from homes, neighbors were offering their barns to store salvaged belongings, and debris was strewn across streets in the eastern and southern parts of the city, Mr. Barrett said.
The students took shelter in a closet with their parents as the tornado battered their home, said Mr. Barrett, who spoke to members of the family on Saturday night.

     Officials: 7 killed as tornado tore through central Iowa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     3/6/22DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Seven people were killed, including two children, when a tornado swept through central Iowa, damaging buildings and knocking down trees and power lines, authorities said.
Emergency management officials in Madison County said four were injured and six people were killed Saturday when the tornado touched down in the area southwest of Des Moines at about 4:30 p.m.
Thunderstorms that spawned tornadoes moved through much of Iowa from the afternoon until Saturday night with storms also causing damage in the Des Moines suburb of Norwalk, areas just east of Des Moines and other areas of eastern Iowa.
At one point, power outages affected about 10,000 in the Des Moines area.
It said weather service teams would investigate the damage Sunday and further assess a potential rating.
