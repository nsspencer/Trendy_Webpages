Durant had 37 points to lead the Nets, who lost despite shooting 50.6 percent from the field.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Durant might be the best player on the planet, but Boston’s Jayson Tatum was the best player on the court Sunday.
There is much work to do, and now with just 17 games left precious little time to do it.
Jayson Tatum scored 54 points in the Celtics’ win over the Nets on March 6, 2022.
And after Durant earned a pair of free throws — sinking both — he capped the run with a pull-up 3-pointer.
Tatum followed two free throws with strong drive into contact for a 114-111 edge.
