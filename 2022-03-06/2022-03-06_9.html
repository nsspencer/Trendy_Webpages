     Iowa: four members of family killed as home razed by tornado
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four of the seven people killed in devastating storms that tore through central Iowa on Saturday were members of the same family who sought shelter inside a home that was razed by a powerful tornado, authorities said.
The storm killed Bazley, 37-year-old Michael Bolger and two of his three young children.
Two others killed in the tornado ‚Äì Rodney Clark, 64, and Cecilia Lloyd, 72 ‚Äì lived just down the street from Bazley in homes also hit by the tornado.
The storms were the deadliest in Iowa since May 2008, when a tornado destroyed nearly 300 homes and killed nine in the northern city of Parkersburg.
Another tornado a month later killed four boys at the Little Sioux Boy Scout ranch in western Iowa.

     Computer glitch delayed National Weather Service warnings before Winterset tornado
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: National Weather Service spokesperson Susan Buchanan said in a statement that the agency's systems slowed down because of an unrelated technical problem at a Texas office.
Comparing the timestamps on the National Weather Service's messages to the actual time they reached his computer, Herzmann said the agency sent its first delayed warning around 3:22 p.m.
The National Weather Services' warnings were not delayed for weather radio listeners, and agency meteorologists spoke directly with their local TV station counterparts, who were tracking the storm live.
Rob Lightbown, a forecaster with Crown Weather Services, a commercial weather service, said the National Weather Service's computer systems also failed during a weekend snow squall in New England.
A couple days later, according to the Post, National Weather Service leaders ordered all meteorologists to return to NWS Chat.
