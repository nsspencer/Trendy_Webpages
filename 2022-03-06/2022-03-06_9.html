     NCAA Tournament 2022: Predicting Favorites for March Madness Bracket
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     0 of 3Young Kwak/Associated PressThere have been plenty of Cinderella runs by college basketball teams in March Madness over the years.
And they're always entertaining to watch, considering a squad that nobody expected to make it deep into the NCAA tournament finds a way to do just that.
Since the NCAA tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, the national title has been won by a No.
The 2022 NCAA tournament has nearly arrived, as this year's 68-team field will be set on Selection Sunday on March 13.
Here's a closer look at several teams that should be the favorites heading into March Madness.

     UB, Bonnies head into conference tournament week with March Madness on their minds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Both the UB and St. Bonaventure men's basketball teams are ready to start conference tournaments, looking to punch their ticket to the NCAA tournament.
BUFFALO, N.Y. — It's officially conference tournament time, so let's check in with two of our local men's basketball teams and see what is in store for them as they look to punch their ticket to the March Madness tournament.
With their victory, the Bonnies officially clinch the fourth spot in the Atlantic 10 conference tournament, which gives them a double-bye and plenty of time to rest and prepare.
As far as their odds to make it to the NCAA's March Madness tournament, according to teamrankings.com, UB is sitting at a 13 percent chance to make it, and the Bonnies just slightly higher at 14 percent.
But don't let numbers fool you, both of these teams can make a deep postseason run in their conference tournaments.
