     Will The Knicks Miss The Playoffs?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ben Stinar and Haley Jordan sat down to talk about the New York Knicks in the latest episode of Stinar For 3.
The New York Knicks went 41-31 last season, which gave them the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference and home-court advantage in the playoffs.
The play-in tournament is not out of the question, but they will have to go on a big winning-streak at some point in the next few weeks.
Even if they pulled off the unthinkable and got into the play-in tournament, the playoffs will still be a tall task.
The question for the Knicks should turn to their future, and if Thibodeau is the right coach and if Randle is the right star to lead the franchise going forward.

     Knicks 131, Kings 115: Scenes from a Julius Randle second-half eruption (the good kind)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Knicks undid a pathetic first half with a historic second half, turning a 20-point deficit into a 16-point rout of the Kings in Sacramento.
They scored 83 points in the second half Monday night.
Knicks 83 points in the second half are the franchise’s most in a second half since Dec. 28, 1969 at PHX (83).
It’s the most in either half since they scored 84 points in the first half at PHI on Nov. 18, 1988.
— NY_KnicksPR (@NY_KnicksPR) March 8, 2022Leading the charge in the second half was Julius Randle, who scored most of his career-high 46 points after halftime.

     Kings defense evaporates in abysmal fall to Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Sacramento Kings returned home to Golden 1 Center with an embarrassing loss to the New York Knicks on Monday night.
If Randle has struggled in a Knicks’ uniform this season Golden 1 Center wouldn’t know it, handling his business at the cup in strong, seasoned fashion.
He accumulated three fouls mid-way through the second quarter, a wise defensive decision by the Kings to keep him at bay.
Sacramento’s three-point shooting kept their head above water as the Knicks’ run left them within striking distance, and an evaporated lead.
Blowing another 20-point lead in only a way that the Sacramento Kings can, we’ll log this in the disappointing, but not surprising file and hope for a better outcome on Wednesday.

     Summary: SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Julius Randle hit eight 3-pointers and scored 17 of his career-high 46 points in the third quarter as the New York Knicks rallied from a 20-point deficit and beat the Sacramento Kings 131-115 on Monday night.
"Julius got going, and it was pretty terrific what he did,'' Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said.
RJ Barrett had 29 points, eight rebounds and six assists to help the Knicks to their second consecutive win after seven straight losses.
Quickley scored four straight points, Fournier added two free throws and Randle made two free throws and a layup to put New York ahead 92-87.

     Young, wild and free: Knicks team ‘Tank’ snaps 7-game funk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau, as dogmatic as he is, has a knack of stumbling into something out of the rubble.
Next to his regular post-Kemba Walker shutdown, starting five of Alec Burks, Evan Fournier, RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and Mitchell Robinson, Thibodeau did the unthinkable.
The Knicks outscored the Clippers by 20 using the Quickley, McBride, Barrett, Reddish, and Sims lineup in 7.3 minutes, according to NBA’s advanced data.
Swap Sims with Robinson, and the Knicks still outscored the Clippers by 10 in 4.3 minutes.
But no thanks, said the Knicks young players on Sunday night.

     Summary: I’m already in too much trouble.’’RJ Barrett also had a big second half and finished with 29 points, and Immanuel Quickley also fired in 27.
The Knicks exploded for a 35-17 start to the second half to erase a 15-point halftime hole.
They racked up 83 points in the second half, their most after intermission since 1969.
Instead of going back to Robinson, Thibodeau put in the veteran Taj Gibson for the first time since the All-Star break.
The Kings got up as many as 20 points in the second quarter and led 63-48 at intermission before it all crashed and burned.
