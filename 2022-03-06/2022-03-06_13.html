     Michigan State basketball vs. Maryland: Scouting report, prediction and senior day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     EAST LANSING – All three of Michigan State basketball’s seniors who play regularly have displayed moments that left Tom Izzo both overjoyed and underwhelmed.
Proud to see them elevate their performance to another level one game, then frustrated because they failed to live up to the bar they set with their talent.
Very much the heartbeat of the Spartans as they head down the stretch.

     Michigan State Basketball: 3 bold predictions for Senior Day vs. Maryland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Senior Day is officially upon us and Michigan State basketball is looking to send three guys out with a bang.
It’s been a season of ups and downs for Michigan State basketball and after a 17-4 start to the year, the Spartans have fallen to 19-11 ahead of a senior day matchup with Maryland.
Michigan State has gone from the 3/4 seed line all the way down to a projection No.
Michigan State won’t be down double-digits by the under-16 timeout for the first time in seemingly weeks.
Will this quick start help the Spartans finally end this slump and catch fire before the Big Ten Tournament?

     Michigan State switching up starting 5 for senior day game vs. Maryland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tom Izzo is making some changes to Michigan State’s starting five for Sunday’s regular-season finale against Maryland.
Izzo said the reasoning behind the adjustments is two-pronged: recent performances and honoring MSU’s veterans on senior day.
Players are disappointed in coaches, coaches are disappointed in players.
But you gotta look at the big picture of things and some guys mature faster than others, some guys it takes a little longer.
But I will say that all three of those guys, all three … of those guys kind of love and live the game.
