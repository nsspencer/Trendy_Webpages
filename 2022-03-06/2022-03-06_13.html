     Summary: Wisconsin's Johnny Davis is hit in the face by Nebraska's Trey McGowens and lands awkwardly under the basket in the second quarter.
(1:02)MADISON, Wis. -- Tenth-ranked Wisconsin lost leading scorer Johnny Davis when he was injured on a flagrant foul early in the second half, and the Badgers missed a chance to clinch the Big Ten title outright by falling to Nebraska 74-73 on Sunday.
Davis was hurt when he was fouled on a layup try by Trey McGowens with 17:32 left.
"I'm optimistic that he's going to be fine,'' Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said, without elaborating further on Davis' injury.
I'll leave it at that and I'll watch the replay and I'll make the necessary phone calls," Gard said.
