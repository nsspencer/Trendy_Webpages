    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. — Throughout the final round Sunday at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, it was as if someone were playing a prank on the world’s best golfers.
Simple tasks, like needing fewer than three attempts to sink a putt from one yard away, were suddenly impossible.
Greenside chips were no less wayward, usually long or short but rarely in between.
The players, one after another, were left scratching their heads, stomping their feet in anger or smiling sardonically.
One tour veteran, Matt Jones, simply flung his putter into a pond after one such vexing experience.

1 for 41 weeks in his career, 12th most all-time.
However, according to Twitter OWGR guru “Nosferatu” each of the top five could end this week at TPC Sawgrass in the No.
The scenarios are not as cut-and-dry as merely winning; for example, aside from victory Scheffler would need Rahm to finish worse than solo 10th and Morikawa outside a three-way tie for second.
Still, that these scenarios exist underlines how tight the top has become.

     Scottie Scheffler wins Arnold Palmer Invitational to secure his second title in three starts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Scottie Scheffler had to overcome not only a stacked field to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational, but also some brutal conditions that left many of the world's top golfers reeling from a grueling weekend of action.
Scheffler's gutsy win at Bay Hill was his second title in three starts after winning February's Phoenix Open, victories that will push the 25-year-old American into the world's top five for the first time.
Extra long rough and rapid greens were compounded by windy conditions over the weekend, but Scheffler recorded a bogey free back nine -- including two impressive par saves on 15 and 16 -- to take home the $2.16 million prize money.
"It feels great to be able to win here," Scheffler told reporters after finishing on five-under par, one clear of Viktor Hovland, Billy Horschel and Tyrrell Hatton.
I'm very pleased I didn't have to play any extra holes today."

     Summary: On the greens, Scheffler ranked fourth in putts per green in regulation, but it was a couple of par-savers that were most important.
Scheffler used his Scotty Cameron prototype putter to hole a 21-footer for par at the 15th after a low punch shot failed to get out of the rough.
On the 16th hole, he made a six-footer after having to lay up with his third shot on the par 5.
Scheffler then finished things off with a steely two-putt from 69 feet on the final hole that ga e him the win when Viktor Hovland and then Billy Horschel failed to birdie the 18th.

“There’s a lot of guys that sort of stay away this week to get ready for next week (The Players Championship).
It’s just a golf course set-up issue and maybe just trying to make it a little less penal when you miss, I guess.
The golf course is hard enough, and then you throw out the firm greens and the wind and not much grass, ball is oscillating a little bit.”

The real heartbreak went to Woodland, trying to win for the first time since the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.
