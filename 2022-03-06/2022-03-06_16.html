    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 0 of 3Young Kwak/Associated PressThere have been plenty of Cinderella runs by college basketball teams in March Madness over the years.

The 2022 NCAA tournament has nearly arrived, as this year's 68-team field will be set on Selection Sunday on March 13.
Here's a closer look at several teams that should be the favorites heading into March Madness.

     Summary: For now, it appears that BYU (22-10) is more likely to end up in the National Invitation Tournament than the NCAA Tournament.
Meanwhile, CBS Sports’ Jerry Palm has the Cougars in the NCAA Tournament as a No.
