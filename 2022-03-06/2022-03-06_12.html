     Michigan State Basketball: 3 bold predictions for Senior Day vs. Maryland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Senior Day is officially upon us and Michigan State basketball is looking to send three guys out with a bang.
It’s been a season of ups and downs for Michigan State basketball and after a 17-4 start to the year, the Spartans have fallen to 19-11 ahead of a senior day matchup with Maryland.
Michigan State has gone from the 3/4 seed line all the way down to a projection No.
Michigan State won’t be down double-digits by the under-16 timeout for the first time in seemingly weeks.
Will this quick start help the Spartans finally end this slump and catch fire before the Big Ten Tournament?
