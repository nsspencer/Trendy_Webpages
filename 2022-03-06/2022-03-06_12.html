     Rapid Recap: Bucks 132, Suns 122
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In an NBA Finals rematch, the Bucks would pull off a comeback win thanks to 44 points from Khris Middleton.
The Suns would open up their lead by as much as ten in the second quarter, but the Bucks would answer nicely.
A 3-pointer from Khris Middleton to close out the period sliced Phoenix’s lead to just three going into halftime.
That was largely due to Khris Middleton, who sat at 28 points through three quarters.
Stat That Stood OutI could obviously go with Khris Middleton, but I’ll talk about that in my Extended Recap.

     Middleton scored a season-high 44 points, Holiday had 24 and the Bucks rallied to beat the short-handed Phoenix Suns 132-122 on Sunday for their fourth consecutive victory.
Holiday scored 17 points and Middleton had 16 in the fourth quarter to help the Bucks outscore the Suns 12-1 over the last three minutes.
This time, Antetokounmpo had 19 points, 13 rebounds and six assists in 31 minutes before fouling out with 1:12 left.
But the Bucks outscored the Suns 18-11 in the four-plus minutes Antetokounmpo missed and owned a 120-118 lead when the two-time MVP returned with 3:23 remaining.
Holiday and Middleton combined for 16 of the Bucks’ 18 points during that stretch.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Bucks would have to play the final minute-plus without their two-time MVP, and were clinging to a five-point lead.
It could have been a nervy finish, but the Bucks still had Khris Middleton.
Middleton finished with a season-high 44 points, eight rebounds and five assists on the day, as the Bucks took down the Suns in a Finals rematch, 132-122.
It was fitting that Middleton's best game of the season came against the Suns in a national TV showcase.
Giannis runs the show, but the Bucks aren't the Bucks without Middleton, and he made that crystal clear again on Sunday.
