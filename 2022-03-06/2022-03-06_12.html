    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Seven people, including two children, died in a series of tornadoes that ripped through multiple counties near Des Moines, Iowa, Saturday, officials said.
Six Madison County residents were killed, Madison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said.

     NCAA Tournament 2022: Predicting Favorites for March Madness Bracket
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     0 of 3Young Kwak/Associated PressThere have been plenty of Cinderella runs by college basketball teams in March Madness over the years.
And they're always entertaining to watch, considering a squad that nobody expected to make it deep into the NCAA tournament finds a way to do just that.
Since the NCAA tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, the national title has been won by a No.
The 2022 NCAA tournament has nearly arrived, as this year's 68-team field will be set on Selection Sunday on March 13.
Here's a closer look at several teams that should be the favorites heading into March Madness.

     Iowa: four members of family killed as home razed by tornado
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four of the seven people killed in devastating storms that tore through central Iowa on Saturday were members of the same family who sought shelter inside a home that was razed by a powerful tornado, authorities said.
The storm killed Bazley, 37-year-old Michael Bolger and two of his three young children.
Two others killed in the tornado – Rodney Clark, 64, and Cecilia Lloyd, 72 – lived just down the street from Bazley in homes also hit by the tornado.
The storms were the deadliest in Iowa since May 2008, when a tornado destroyed nearly 300 homes and killed nine in the northern city of Parkersburg.
Another tornado a month later killed four boys at the Little Sioux Boy Scout ranch in western Iowa.

     UB, Bonnies head into conference tournament week with March Madness on their minds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Both the UB and St. Bonaventure men's basketball teams are ready to start conference tournaments, looking to punch their ticket to the NCAA tournament.
BUFFALO, N.Y. — It's officially conference tournament time, so let's check in with two of our local men's basketball teams and see what is in store for them as they look to punch their ticket to the March Madness tournament.
With their victory, the Bonnies officially clinch the fourth spot in the Atlantic 10 conference tournament, which gives them a double-bye and plenty of time to rest and prepare.
As far as their odds to make it to the NCAA's March Madness tournament, according to teamrankings.com, UB is sitting at a 13 percent chance to make it, and the Bonnies just slightly higher at 14 percent.
But don't let numbers fool you, both of these teams can make a deep postseason run in their conference tournaments.

     Mother says 4 of 7 killed in Iowa tornadoes from same family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Family members said the children’s mother, 8-year-old brother, grandfather and uncle survived the storm, but they were injured.
The storm killed Bazley, 37-year-old Michael Bolger and two of his three young children, 5-year-old Kinlee Bolger and 2-year-old Owen Bolger.
A GoFundMe page for the family says Kuri Bolger, who is the children’s mother and Bazley’s daughter, was hospitalized after being seriously injured.
They were just the light of my life.”Authorities say seven people are dead after tornadoes swept through central Iowa.
Another tornado a month later killed four boys at the Little Sioux Boy Scout ranch in western Iowa.
