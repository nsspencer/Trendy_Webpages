     'Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty' review: HBO's nostalgic miniseries doesn't conjure much magic

     Summary: (CNN) The equivalent of missing what should be an easy layup, "Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty" stumbles on the road to greatness, undermining can't-miss subject matter for basketball fans with an uneven, at times farcical tone.
Although '80s-style excess clearly accounts for much of the sizzle, this exercise feels like a no-look pass that skips out of bounds.
Produced by "Don't Look Up's" Adam McKay (who also directed the first episode), and based on Jeff Pearlman's book about the period, the 10-episode series focuses on the first season in which new owner Jerry Buss (John C. Reilly) drafted rookie phenom Earvin "Magic" Johnson (standout newcomer Quincy Isaiah), winning the first of five NBA titles in a decade.
In addition to their passion for basketball, the late Buss and Johnson (who has notably disavowed the project ) shared a playboy lifestyle, while transforming the Forum, where the Lakers played their games, into the hottest ticket in town.
Still, "Winning Time" feels too cute for its own good, especially in the early going, when characters keep breaking the fourth wall to chat directly with the audience, and everyone but Buss and Magic appears to be kind of a jerk.

Jerry West fucking and shitting and goddamning everyone he crosses.
You can't forget, of course, Jerry Buss waltzing around like Hugh Hefner's long-lost brother.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar added, “the story of the Showtime Lakers is best told by those who actually lived through it.” (No comment yet from Jeanie Buss, the current Los Angeles Lakers owner and daughter of Jerry.)

     Summary: Created by Max Borstein and Don't Look Up director Adam McKay, Winning Time is a dramatized version of the Lakers' rise to fame and the connected rise of the NBA and African-American culture.
Winning Time's cast also includes a number of notable actors in smaller roles, from Sally Field to Adrien Brody.
Winning Time Opening Theme Song"My Favorite Mutiny" by The Coup: Winning Time's opening credits sequence, a montage that puts the Lakers' rise in context of the cultural turmoil of the 1980s, is set to "My Favorite Mutiny" by The Coup.
The 2006 song is one of the few 21st-century tracks used in Winning Time.
"Night and Day" by Fred Astaire: Another somewhat ironic song choice, this old-school Astaire number plays over Winning Time episode 1's closing montage.

     Every Song In Winning Time Season 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Created by Max Borstein and Don't Look Up director Adam McKay, Winning Time is a dramatized version of the Lakers' rise to fame and the connected rise of the NBA and African-American culture.
Winning Time's cast also includes a number of notable actors in smaller roles, from Sally Field to Adrien Brody.
Winning Time Opening Theme Song"My Favorite Mutiny" by The Coup: Winning Time's opening credits sequence, a montage that puts the Lakers' rise in context of the cultural turmoil of the 1980s, is set to "My Favorite Mutiny" by The Coup.
The 2006 song is one of the few 21st-century tracks used in Winning Time.
"Night and Day" by Fred Astaire: Another somewhat ironic song choice, this old-school Astaire number plays over Winning Time episode 1's closing montage.

     Summary: Winning Time starts off promisingly, with a cold open set in 1991 as Lakers star Magic Johnson receives his HIV diagnosis.
Winning Time’s first episode was directed by Adam McKay, who also serves as an executive producer on the series.
For a series about one of the most famous basketball teams in history, Winning Time shows remarkably little actual basketball.
(Ferrell had wanted to play Buss, and was hurt when McKay went instead for Reilly, who’s Ferrell’s best friend.)
Winning Time evokes an iconic moment in Lakers history, just not the one it wants to.

     ‘Winning Time’ Recap: When Magic Met Jerry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Magic had just been diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, which at the time was a death sentence.
In some ways, Jerry and Magic are two very different men.
The Jerry scenes are a delight, and “The Swan” smartly contrasts him with the old-money arrogance of Cooke (played by Michael O’Keefe).
Lakers coach Jerry West thinks Magic is too tall to play point guard, even though the kid just helped win a college national championship at that position.
Warrick Page/HBOIt is not a spoiler to say this will be far from the last time either Jerry or Magic will get to party on and around this court.
