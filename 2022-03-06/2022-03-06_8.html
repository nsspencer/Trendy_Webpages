    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kevin Durant was stellar for the Nets in his second game back since returning from injury, but on Saturday afternoon in Boston, no Brooklyn player could match Jayson Tatum as the 24-year-old dropped a season-high 54 points.
The Celtics weathered a great run from the Nets in the third quarter, and Tatum single-handedly kept Boston in in the game, scoring six points in the final 40 seconds of the period to close a seven-point Nets lead to just one.
Tatum continued his takeover, scoring 18 points in the fourth to surpass his previous season-high of 51.
In the fourth quarter, Durant surpassed 25,000 career points, becoming just the 23rd player in NBA history to hit that mark.
Durant finished the game with 37 points, with eight assists and six rebounds.

Jayson Tatum scored 54 points in the Celtics‚Äô win over the Nets on March 6, 2022.
And after Durant earned a pair of free throws ‚Äî sinking both ‚Äî he capped the run with a pull-up 3-pointer.
Tatum followed two free throws with strong drive into contact for a 114-111 edge.
