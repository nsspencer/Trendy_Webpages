    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ✖Is Dolly Parton ready to make more movies with Netflix?
When asked about her collaborations with Netflix, Parton said that those who work at the streaming service are "wonderful."

     Dolly Parton To Launch NFT Collection ‘Dollyverse’ At SXSW
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dolly Parton is going on a virtual tour with best-selling author, James Patterson, to promote their new novel Run Rose Run.
Parton is also partnering with FOX Entertainment’s Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL) to launch “Dollyverse,” which is an audience-centric Web3 experience, at the South by Southwest Conference (SXSW) and Festivals starting next week.
The debut of Run Rose Run will have Parton make her first-ever appearance at SXSW on March 18, where she and Patterson will speak about the project at Austin City Limits Live at The Moody Theater.
The “Dollyverse” will release an exclusive selection of official and certified Dolly NFT collectibles, including limited-edition NFTs of the Run Rose Run album and a limited series of Dolly-inspired NFT artwork.
“Beyond her legendary status in the music industry, Dolly embodies the SXSW spirit as she extends her unique brand of creativity across many verticals,” he said.

     Dolly Parton’s New Novel Exposes Dark Side Of The Music Industry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dolly Parton made her album debut with Hello, I’m Dolly in 1967, which led to success throughout the rest of the 1960s.
Dolly Parton’s new novel recently revealed the “dark side” of the music industry.
Dolly Parton’s upcoming novel will be “dark” and autobiographical.
On March 7, Parton will co-host the 57th Academy of Country Music Awards with fellow country stars Jimmie Allen and Gabby Barrett.
The Grammy winner recently told People that she will perform a song from her “Run, Rose, Run” album with Kelsea Ballerini.

     Dolly Parton and James Patterson can relate to the heroine of their first book together, ‘Run Rose Run’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There’s sort of dual storytelling going on, with each working in their most comfortable medium: Patterson writing the book, and Parton writing and recording songs.
“We alternated words,” Patterson deadpanned as he and Parton talked on the phone back in December, such was the advance planning for this book.
Parton, meantime, was writing songs, which she would send to Patterson, and sometimes they’d stimulate a chapter.
“Well, I could relate to the character in every way,” Parton said.
Parton and Patterson worked on this book, they reckon, for about a year to a year and a half, and they did it during COVID-19.
