Boston went back-and-fourth with the Brooklyn Nets for a full 48 minutes, closing the game on a 16-9 run en route to a 126-120 win at TD Garden.
This wasn’t a banged-up Nets team like the one the Celtics beat up on a few weeks ago.
Brooklyn had both Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in the lineup, with the duo playing 39 and 37 minutes respectively.

     Boston Celtics: Jayson Tatum sensational in spectacular week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After defeating the Brooklyn Nets with ease in their last two meetings, the Boston Celtics finally faced a (nearly) complete Nets squad.
Jayson Tatum hoisting the Boston Celtics on his shouldersTatum’s output on Sunday was the fourth-time in his career that he scored 50 or more points in a regular season game.
This ties him with Boston Celtics legend Larry Bird in becoming the only players in franchise history to achieve this feat four times.
Boston Celtics: The week aheadThe Celtics are 4-3 in 2021-22 against their next three opponents.
It was in early February and prior to the trade deadline when these teams last met, a Boston victory.

     Another Jayson Tatum masterpiece (54 points) lifts Celtics to statement win over Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But Celtics forward Jayson Tatum was fine with that.
Last month, the Celtics twice feasted on an overmatched Nets team that was missing almost all of its top players.
The All-Star forward erupted for 54 points and guided the Celtics to a 126-120 win.
“When we kind of match that energy on offense, we’ll really be special.”Jayson Tatum scores two of his 54 points Sunday against the Nets.
And defensively we knew what we were going to be: a mentally tough team that can play through runs.

     What Stood Out in Celtics' Win vs. Nets: Jayson Tatum's 54 Points Help Boston Pass Its Latest Test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Led by a 54-point masterpiece from Jayson Tatum, the Celtics earned a 126-120 win over the Nets on Sunday.
The three-time All-Star and burgeoning superstar hung 54 points on the Nets to lead Boston to victory.
It wasn't just about Tatum scoring over 50 points, but it was the way he did it, seemingly never taking a bad shot; nothing felt forced.
After the game, Brown said he thought he could give it a go today, and his ankle "felt pretty good."
After the game, Tatum said, "Rob is probably the most important guy for the ceiling that we’re trying to get to."

     Jayson Tatum's 54 points lead Boston Celtics past Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jayson Tatum knocks down shots from all over the court, dropping 54 points and leading the Celtics to the win over the Nets.
That wasn't the case Sunday afternoon, as the Brooklyn Nets rolled into TD Garden for this matinee affair featuring Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving playing together for just the fourth time this season.
Part of the reason is that, as Boston has seen its level of play rise over the past few weeks, Tatum's has, too.
He has the legs late in those fourth quarters to take over the games and that's what it's all about.
Before Sunday's game, Celtics coach Ime Udoka stressed how difficult the challenge of stopping Brooklyn would be for his team.
