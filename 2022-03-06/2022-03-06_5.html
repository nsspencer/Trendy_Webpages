     SNL's Kate McKinnon Takes Aim at Florida's "Don't Say Gay" Bill: Watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kate McKinnon stopped by Weekend Update during last night’s Saturday Night Live to speak about Florida’s discriminatory “Don’t Say Gay” bill.
“I heard about this law, and I think it’s amazing,” McKinnon told a baffled Colin Jost.
You cannot say gay in school anymore,’ I’m just like, I’m so jazzed.
“It’s just like that thing of when they say, ‘Don’t say gay,’ then it’s like stuck in your head, but it’s fine.
Like, does this ‘Don’t Say Gay’ law have a purpose?”Advertisement“Well, I guess it’s so kids aren’t going home with questions parents don’t want to answer?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “I’m sorry to barge in here… I heard about this law, and I think it’s amazing,” offered McKinnon, clearly in jest.
You cannot say ‘gay’ in school anymore!’ I’m so jazzed.
It just feels like this is gonna make kids gay and trans—sorry, depressed and suicidal—and I think these laws are lesbians.
Does this ‘Don’t Say Gay’ law have a purpose?”Jost did not have an answer.
And with that, McKinnon closed out the bit by singing the word “gay” over and over again to the tune of Deep Purple’s “Smoke on the Water.”For more, listen and subscribe to The Last Laugh podcast.

     SNL all-star Kate McKinnon joined Colin Jost on Weekend Update to discuss Florida’s hateful and cruel “Don’t Say Gay” bill that just passed in the state’s House of Representatives.
She continued, “If the ’90s were right, and ‘gay’ means ‘bad,’ then this is the gayest law I have ever seen,” before encouraging the audience to sing “gay” instead, as she begins singing “gay, gay, gay” to the beat of Deep Purple’s “Smoke on the Water.”Fans and celebrities quickly took to social media to celebrate McKinnon’s rant and to condemn the bill, including last month’s host Ariana DeBose:“If you can’t say it you might as well sing it.”- Kate McKinnonCue me: Belting from the rafters 🗣🏳️‍🌈 GAY GAY GAY, GAY, GAY GAY GAY.

     'SNL': Kate McKinnon Takes on Florida's "Don't Say Gay" Bill During Weekend Update
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This weekend's Saturday Night Live episode featured the evergreen Weekend Update segment, hosted by Colin Jost and Michael Che.
Another one of these contentious subjects was the Parental Rights in Education bill, most commonly known (especially by dissidents) as the 'Don't Say Gay' bill.
To discuss it, SNL regular Kate McKinnon joined Jost and, of course, injected ironic humor into the situation.
McKinnon was welcomed to the Update desk while being showered by the warm cheers and applause of the live audience.
However, the 'Don't Say Gay' bill is not devised to prevent the word from being used as an insult in schools.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Known as the Parental Rights in Education bill but coined the "Don't Say Gay" bill by critics, the controversial legislation would allow parents greater authority to take legal action against school districts that violate the bill.
McKinnon called the bill "unconscionable," but only after Weekend Update co-anchor Colin Jost cleared up some misconceptions.
