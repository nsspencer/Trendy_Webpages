     Summary: 2 of 7Credit: All Elite WrestlingAmong some great competitors, Wardlow was able to grab the brass ring and win the Face of the Revolution ladder match.
This proves MJF wrong, as he had said Wardlow wasn't going to win.
Assuming he can retain the TNT Championship over Scorpio Sky, Sammy Guevara is going to have his work cut out for him.
Wardlow has been on a tear and has the size advantage and momentum on his side.
If that's not the case and the belt is going to stay on Guevara, it will likely be due to MJF interfering and costing Wardlow the win out of spite.

     Summary: AEW Revolution 2022 is in the books, and as is often the case with AEW, there was something for everyone.
Have I ever got the match for you, MJF vs. CM Punk in a brutal, thumbtack-filled dog collar match.
Courtesy of AEWIt wouldn’t be an AEW pay-per-view weekend without a big company-wide story blanketing the surroundings.
But it is impossible to watch Revolution and not see the incredible contrast to WWE’s own Madison Square Garden house show that ran the night before.
It pushed over and over that universal champion Roman Reigns vs. WWE champion Brock Lesnar might not be a title vs. title match at WrestleMania because a secret opponent might very well beat Brock at the Garden.

     Summary: In the main event, "Hangman" Adam Page was able to outlast Adam Cole to retain the AEW world championship.
Death Triangle - Grade: B+Chris Jericho vs. Eddie Kingston: Kingston landed a half-and-half suplex seconds after the bell rang, dropping Jericho on the top of his head.
Kingston vs. Jericho was the best kind of wrestling, if not quite perfect.
Cole hit a series of superkicks only for Page to nearly hit the Buckshot again.
A second Buckshot Lariat was enough to finish off Cole after Page hit a few superkicks of his own.
