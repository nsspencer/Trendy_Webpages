     Ball Boy Mikel Arteta Assists Classic Arsenal Goal As Young Gunners Shine In Win At Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal's youngsters stole the show in Sunday's 3-2 win at Watford but 39-year-old manager Mikel Arteta also played a key part in one of his side's goals.
What a beautiful goal it was too, with the final three players involved all taking just one touch.
Arteta played the role of ball boy as he quickly fed Bukayo Saka who set Arsenal on the attack with a throw-in to Cedric Soares.
That Martinelli goal made the score 3-1 to Arsenal seven minutes into the second half.
Saka had earlier set up Odegaard for Arsenal's opener, before scoring their second goal himself.

     Watford vs Arsenal live score and result: Latest updates after Martinelli helps Arsenal to 3-2 Premier League win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal moved up into the top four of the Premier League after a 3-2 win against Watford at Vicarage Road.
The Gunners won their fourth game in a row to jump above Manchester United and West Ham in the table thanks to goals from Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli.
Odegaard gave Arsenal the lead after a superb passing move before Cucho Hernandez's stunning overhead kick levelled the scoring for Watford.
Bukayo Saka then regained the lead in the first half for Arsenal with a powerful finish after some great link-up with Alexandre Lacazette.
Moussa Sissoko’s late goal gave Watford hope in stoppage time, but they could not avoid an eighth straight home league defeat.

     Watford vs Arsenal LIVE: Premier League result, final score and reaction - Odegaard, Saka and Martinelli win it for Gunners
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Close Arsenal stars train at Emirates before Watford testArsenal climbed back into the Premier League top four as goals from Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli helped them to a lively 3-2 win over Watford at Vicarage Road.
It was a victory more convincing for the Gunners than the scoreline suggests, as their young attacking players shone to punish a Hornets side that, to their credit, fought gamely until the end.
But a draw would have more than the Hornets deserved and their battle against relegation from the Premier League is looking like an increasingly uphill battle.
For their part, the Gunners have their top-four destiny in their own hands and three sublime finishes from Odegaard, Saka and Martinelli – all of whom should have big futures at the Emirates – demonstrated the quality Mikel Arteta can call on as the season reaches the business end.

     Gabriel Martinelli sends Arsenal fourth despite Watford fightback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Watford usually lay claim to that colour but it is Arsenal who bask in a warm glow these days.
The number of players better than Bukayo Saka in the top flight at this point could possibly be counted on one hand.
Gabriel Martinelli offered another demonstration of his quality and, with four wins on the bounce, Arsenal are flying.
Watford looked slightly more likely to score until, on the half-hour mark, Saka showed much of what he does so wonderfully.
Arsenal might say the same of their fellow contenders at the top, but pole position for fourth is firmly theirs.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Janusz Michallik is full of praise for Mikel Arteta for how he has turned Arsenal into a team competing for the top-4.
Bukayo Saka scored one and made another as Arsenal claimed a 3-2 win at Watford on Sunday to take another vital step forward in their pursuit of Champions League qualification.
Arsenal's fourth straight Premier League win was inspired by Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard.
The time Arsenal have had to work without European football -- and in their midseason break to Dubai -- is paying off.
The ability of Saka and Odegaard to impact matches is a critical asset for a team still lacking a potent No.
