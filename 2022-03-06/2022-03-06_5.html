     Tornado kills 7, including 2 children, near Des Moines, Iowa, officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Seven people, including two children, died in a tornado that ripped through multiple counties near Des Moines, Iowa, Saturday, officials said.
Six Madison County residents were killed, Madison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said.
A person in a rural area near the Lucas County city of Chariton was also killed, an official said.
The National Weather Service office in Des Moines said an initial estimate showed the tornado was an EF3, with wind speeds of at least 136 miles per hour.
Ayala said the tornado damaged or destroyed about 52 homes in Madison County within a span of 13.7 miles and that the wind speed at one point reached 155 miles per hour.

     Iowa tornado kills seven people, including two children
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Seven people were killed Saturday, including two children under the age of five, when a tornado swept through central Iowa, damaging buildings and knocking down trees and power lines, in the deadliest storm to hit the state since 2008, authorities said.
The storms are the deadliest to occur in Iowa since May 2008 when one tornado destroyed nearly 300 homes and killed nine people in the northern Iowa city of Parkersburg.
Another tornado a month later in the state killed four boys.
Saturday’s storms were not nearly as unusual as the mid-December tornado outbreak that Iowa saw last year, he said.
Power outages affected about 10,000 in the Des Moines area.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Thunderstorms that spawned tornadoes moved through much of Iowa from the afternoon until Saturday night with storms also causing damage in the Des Moines suburb of Norwalk, areas just east of Des Moines and other areas of eastern Iowa.
At one point, power outages affected about 10,000 in the Des Moines area.
Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for Madison County, which allows state resources to be used to assist with response and recovery efforts.
Officials identified the six people who were killed in Madison County as Melissa Bazley, 63; Rodney Clark, 64; Cecilia Lloyd, 72; Michael Bolger, 37; Kenley Bolger, 5; and Owen Bolger, 2.
Six people hurt in Madison County, which is known for the “Bridges of Madison County” book and movie, were being treated for injuries Sunday, but their conditions weren’t immediately available.
