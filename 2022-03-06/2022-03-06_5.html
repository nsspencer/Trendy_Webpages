     Biggest Takeaways from AEW Revolution 2022 Results
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2 of 7Credit: All Elite WrestlingAmong some great competitors, Wardlow was able to grab the brass ring and win the Face of the Revolution ladder match.
This proves MJF wrong, as he had said Wardlow wasn't going to win.
Assuming he can retain the TNT Championship over Scorpio Sky, Sammy Guevara is going to have his work cut out for him.
Wardlow has been on a tear and has the size advantage and momentum on his side.
If that's not the case and the belt is going to stay on Guevara, it will likely be due to MJF interfering and costing Wardlow the win out of spite.

     Boston Celtics: Jayson Tatum sensational in spectacular week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After defeating the Brooklyn Nets with ease in their last two meetings, the Boston Celtics finally faced a (nearly) complete Nets squad.
Jayson Tatum hoisting the Boston Celtics on his shouldersTatum’s output on Sunday was the fourth-time in his career that he scored 50 or more points in a regular season game.
This ties him with Boston Celtics legend Larry Bird in becoming the only players in franchise history to achieve this feat four times.

     AEW Revolution review: Show highlights contrast with WWE
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AEW Revolution 2022 is in the books, and as is often the case with AEW, there was something for everyone.
Have I ever got the match for you, MJF vs. CM Punk in a brutal, thumbtack-filled dog collar match.
Courtesy of AEWIt wouldn’t be an AEW pay-per-view weekend without a big company-wide story blanketing the surroundings.
But it is impossible to watch Revolution and not see the incredible contrast to WWE’s own Madison Square Garden house show that ran the night before.
It pushed over and over that universal champion Roman Reigns vs. WWE champion Brock Lesnar might not be a title vs. title match at WrestleMania because a secret opponent might very well beat Brock at the Garden.

     Another Jayson Tatum masterpiece (54 points) lifts Celtics to statement win over Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But Celtics forward Jayson Tatum was fine with that.
Last month, the Celtics twice feasted on an overmatched Nets team that was missing almost all of its top players.

“When we kind of match that energy on offense, we’ll really be special.”Jayson Tatum scores two of his 54 points Sunday against the Nets.

     What Stood Out in Celtics' Win vs. Nets: Jayson Tatum's 54 Points Help Boston Pass Its Latest Test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Led by a 54-point masterpiece from Jayson Tatum, the Celtics earned a 126-120 win over the Nets on Sunday.
The three-time All-Star and burgeoning superstar hung 54 points on the Nets to lead Boston to victory.
It wasn't just about Tatum scoring over 50 points, but it was the way he did it, seemingly never taking a bad shot; nothing felt forced.
After the game, Brown said he thought he could give it a go today, and his ankle "felt pretty good."
After the game, Tatum said, "Rob is probably the most important guy for the ceiling that we’re trying to get to."

     Jayson Tatum's 54 points lead Boston Celtics past Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jayson Tatum knocks down shots from all over the court, dropping 54 points and leading the Celtics to the win over the Nets.
That wasn't the case Sunday afternoon, as the Brooklyn Nets rolled into TD Garden for this matinee affair featuring Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving playing together for just the fourth time this season.
Part of the reason is that, as Boston has seen its level of play rise over the past few weeks, Tatum's has, too.
He has the legs late in those fourth quarters to take over the games and that's what it's all about.
Before Sunday's game, Celtics coach Ime Udoka stressed how difficult the challenge of stopping Brooklyn would be for his team.

     Summary: In the main event, "Hangman" Adam Page was able to outlast Adam Cole to retain the AEW world championship.
Death Triangle - Grade: B+Chris Jericho vs. Eddie Kingston: Kingston landed a half-and-half suplex seconds after the bell rang, dropping Jericho on the top of his head.
Kingston vs. Jericho was the best kind of wrestling, if not quite perfect.
Cole hit a series of superkicks only for Page to nearly hit the Buckshot again.
A second Buckshot Lariat was enough to finish off Cole after Page hit a few superkicks of his own.
