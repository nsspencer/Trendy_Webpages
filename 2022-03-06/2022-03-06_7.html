    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As did his Boston Celtics, All-Star forward Jayson Tatum had a slow start to his 2021-22 NBA season.
But it’s getting well nigh impossible to ignore what Tatum and Boston have been up to since the arrival of the new year.
The Celtics have morphed into the league’s best defense and a top-10 offense.
Much of that has been fueled by the St. Louis native’s play, no better demonstrated than in the 54-point outburst Tatum unleashed on the Brooklyn Nets at TD Garden on Sunday afternoon.
