     To play the role, Fishback wrote a journal for her character and shared it with Mosley and Jackson.
“I wanted to really bring Robyn from the book to the series as much as we could,” she says.
It was a huge collaboration with both of them, so I was really thankful.”Jackson, meanwhile, chose a different approach.
“It’s a fairy tale,” Mosley says.
“But a dark fairy tale in more ways than one.”

     ‘The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey’ review: Samuel L. Jackson stars in a tale of secrets and buried treasure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For a conspicuously busy superstar such as Samuel L. Jackson, the six-part Apple TV+ adaptation of Walter Mosley’s “The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey” demanded his largest, deepest commitment to a role in a long time.
Jackson serves as executive producer and star of “Ptolemy Grey,” which is based on the 2010 novel from the author made famous by the Easy Rawlins mysteries.
A lot of what’s best about “Ptolemy Grey” is pretty simple and consistently rewarding: the interplay between Jackson and Dominique Fishback, who plays the teenage caregiver of the title character.
Much of Grey’s long life doesn’t make the cut here in limited series form.
At its best “Ptolemy Grey” lets the audience know it’s listening to a writer with a singular ear for vernacular, and dramatic poetry.

     The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey Review: A Strong Hook That Fails to Dig Deep Enough
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As adapted by Walter Mosley from his own novel, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey opens with a fascinating hook.
Yet, while the man can recall his entire life without a hitch, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey remains curiously limited in what it chooses to depict.
Admittedly, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey is meant to be about taking decisive action rather than dwelling on the pain and regret of the past.
But in focusing so little on those aspects of Ptolemy’s life, the character and the actions he undertakes feel incomplete, to say nothing of the supporting characters.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey starts strong but, by failing to probe further into its protagonist’s life, its main character only grows thinner as the story progresses.
