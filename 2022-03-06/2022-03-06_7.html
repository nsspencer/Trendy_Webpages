     Ball Boy Mikel Arteta Assists Classic Arsenal Goal As Young Gunners Shine In Win At Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal's youngsters stole the show in Sunday's 3-2 win at Watford but 39-year-old manager Mikel Arteta also played a key part in one of his side's goals.
What a beautiful goal it was too, with the final three players involved all taking just one touch.
Arteta played the role of ball boy as he quickly fed Bukayo Saka who set Arsenal on the attack with a throw-in to Cedric Soares.
That Martinelli goal made the score 3-1 to Arsenal seven minutes into the second half.
Saka had earlier set up Odegaard for Arsenal's opener, before scoring their second goal himself.

     Boston Celtics’ Jayson Tatum scores season-high 54 points in 126-120 win against the Brooklyn Nets

     Summary: The Boston Celtics’ Jayson Tatum dropped a season-high 54 points, shooting 16-of-30 from the field to lead the team to a 126-120 win over the Brooklyn Nets.
Tatum tied Hall of Famer and Boston legend Larry Bird for the most 50-point games in Celtics history with four.
The 24-year-old Tatum also earned his fourth 50-point game in eight fewer years than Bird, who accomplished the feat when he was 32 years old.
Kevin Durant led the Nets with 37 points, eight assists and six rebounds in 39 minutes of action in his second game back from a left knee injury.
Boston (39-27) maintains the fifth spot in the Eastern Conference; Brooklyn (32-33) is currently tied for eighth with the Charlotte Hornets.

     Roy Keane and Gary Neville disagree on Arsenal's Champions League chances amid Man United claim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Gunners came off the back of a last-gasp victory against Bruno Lage's Wolves and continued to show that they really are the real deal under Mikel Arteta.
Still, United icon Gary Neville has predicted Ralf Rangnick and Co to pip Arteta's side to fourth place.
Speaking on Sky Sports, Neville said: "I think United will still do it (finish in the top four).
However, Keane disagreed with his former United teammate, backing the north London outfit as favourites to qualify for next season's UEFA Champions League.
"We're praising them now but they've had some shocking results, especially in the cup competitions, but if you had said that they could finish above Man United a few months ago, you'd have been locked up."

     Highlights: Arsenal claim vital win at Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     We sealed our fourth win on the bounce in the Premier League at Watford on Sunday as we maintained the pace in the hunt for a top-four finish.
Martin Odegaard gave us the lead at Vicarage Road with a fine strike, before Cucho Hernandez equalised with a brilliant overhead kick.
We restored our lead before half time with a clinical finish from Bukayo Saka, and made it three when Gabriel Martinelli slotted the ball high into the roof of the net.
But Watford set up a grandstand finish when Moussa Sissoko fired in from a tight angle but we held on for a vital victory.

     WATCH: Is Boston Celtics All-Star forward Jayson Tatum a top-10 player in the NBA?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As did his Boston Celtics, All-Star forward Jayson Tatum had a slow start to his 2021-22 NBA season.
But it’s getting well nigh impossible to ignore what Tatum and Boston have been up to since the arrival of the new year.
The Celtics have morphed into the league’s best defense and a top-10 offense.
Much of that has been fueled by the St. Louis native’s play, no better demonstrated than in the 54-point outburst Tatum unleashed on the Brooklyn Nets at TD Garden on Sunday afternoon.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal moved up into the top four of the Premier League after a 3-2 win against Watford at Vicarage Road.
The Gunners won their fourth game in a row to jump above Manchester United and West Ham in the table thanks to goals from Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli.
Odegaard gave Arsenal the lead after a superb passing move before Cucho Hernandez's stunning overhead kick levelled the scoring for Watford.
Bukayo Saka then regained the lead in the first half for Arsenal with a powerful finish after some great link-up with Alexandre Lacazette.
Moussa Sissoko’s late goal gave Watford hope in stoppage time, but they could not avoid an eighth straight home league defeat.

     Arsenal: From bottom of the Premier League to fourth - the changes that sparked revival
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal began this season in crisis mode.
Losing their opening three Premier League games, they sat bottom of the table with zero goals scored and nine conceded.Gradual improvements throughout 2021-22 have seen them climb the table since.The initial focus was on solidifying the back line and then came the attacking thrust from their young stars.
The major difference between then and now comes from the players at Mikel Arteta’s disposal.Pablo Mari, Calum Chambers and Sead Kolasinac played in those opening three games.
Each of them made just two league appearances before their departures.Takehiro Tomiyasu was still at Bologna, Ben White missed two of the three games with COVID-19, Gabriel had not returned from his summer knee injury, while Kieran Tierney was the only one to start all three games.With Aaron Ramsdale in goal, this back four made an immediate impact.
Their first three league games together yielded two clean sheets and one goal conceded.That unit has become more reliable both as a group and as individuals as the season has progressed.Arsenal were conceding chances of higher quality with 1.

     Arsenal driven by Bukayo Saka-Martin Odegaard combination to boost top-four hopes with win at Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Janusz Michallik is full of praise for Mikel Arteta for how he has turned Arsenal into a team competing for the top-4.
Bukayo Saka scored one and made another as Arsenal claimed a 3-2 win at Watford on Sunday to take another vital step forward in their pursuit of Champions League qualification.
Arsenal's fourth straight Premier League win was inspired by Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard.
The time Arsenal have had to work without European football -- and in their midseason break to Dubai -- is paying off.
The ability of Saka and Odegaard to impact matches is a critical asset for a team still lacking a potent No.

     Arsenal: Bukayo Saka's penalty miss at Euro 2020 was 'great for his career', says Mikel Arteta
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta claimed Bukayo Saka's penalty miss at Euro 2020 was 'great for his career' after the England international scored one goal and set up another in the 3-2 win at Watford.
The Arsenal academy graduate then restored his side's advantage after a well-worked one-two with Alexandre Lacazette, before Gabriel Martinelli added a third.
Saka missed the decisive spot-kick during England's agonising Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy at Wembley then suffered racist abuse online, along with Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford, who also missed penalties.
Saka was subject to racial abuse after the Euro 2020 final before the footballing world showed their support to himArteta believes Saka, who has enjoyed an impressive season so far, is better for the experience.
I don't think I can ask any more from the players and what they gave Watford Football Club and the fans today, I really don't.'

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Celtics forward Jayson Tatum was fine with that.
Last month, the Celtics twice feasted on an overmatched Nets team that was missing almost all of its top players.
The All-Star forward erupted for 54 points and guided the Celtics to a 126-120 win.
“When we kind of match that energy on offense, we’ll really be special.”Jayson Tatum scores two of his 54 points Sunday against the Nets.
And defensively we knew what we were going to be: a mentally tough team that can play through runs.

     Mikel Arteta sounds off on Alexandre Lacazette’s Arsenal future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has claimed that the club will evaluate forward Alexandre Lacazette’s future with the Gunners at the end of the season.
In speaking following Arsenal’s 3-2 Premier League away win over Watford, Arteta was asked whether he would want to keep the soon-to-be free agent at the club.
The Arsenal manager later mentioned in October that “anything is possible” regarding the Frenchman’s contract status.
While Lacazette has not been chipping in with goals as of late, Arteta is much pleased to see the French talent emerge as a playmaker within the team.
Next up for Arsenal will be a key league home clash against Leicester City.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON (CBS) — Jayson Tatum was an absolute stud for the Boston Celtics on Sunday, scoring 54 points in a showdown with the Brooklyn Nets.
