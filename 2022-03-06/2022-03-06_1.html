In the first half they had more energy than in the second half, when they struggled to press.
Our rhythm was better in the second half, and it was one of the highest levels we have played at.
We struggled with our build-up play, and in the first half our chances were more through counter-attack than in possession.
“In the second half Bernardo was more involved, he had the personality to play between the lines, and the movement from Jack, Phil, Kevin and everyone was excellent.
