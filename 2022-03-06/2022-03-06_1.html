     Report: Cristiano Ronaldo Out for Manchester United vs. Manchester City with Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AP Photo/Rui VieiraManchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo is reportedly out of Sunday's match against Manchester City with an injury.
Laurie Whitwell of The Athletic reported that Ronaldo will sit out after not being listed in Ralf Rangnick's 21-man squad.
There was the possibility Ronaldo could have been a late arrival, but those hopes were dashed early Sunday.
They are 19 points behind league-leading Manchester City through the first 27 games of the season.
Ronaldo returned to United in August after leaving the club for Real Madrid in 2009.

In the first half we created good angles, moved the ball away and created chances.
But the disappointing thing is how sloppy we were in the second half.
“It comes down to individuals, concentration and how we deal with the expectation of playing for Man United.
We need to win in the Champions League and get in the top four, that’s all I’m thinking about.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manchester United face city rivals Manchester City in another chapter of the Manchester derby this Sunday, with both teams needing points.
Many predicted lineups had Ronaldo slotted in to lead the United attack, and without Cavani (groin), Anthony Elanga and Jadon Sancho will carry the attack.
He returned to training and Rangnick made it sound like he'd be part of the squad against Man City in the lead-up.
Luke ShawInjury: COVID-19COVID-19 Out since: March 2Rangnick confirmed that the left back is out for the match against Manchester City after picking up COVID-19 in midweek.
He returns to the matchday squad, joining the subs list against Man City after missing out entirely against Watford in the 0-0 draw last time out.

     Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez inspire Manchester City to win over Manchester United
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Two goals each from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez helped Manchester City cruise to comfortable win against rivals Manchester United in the cold March sun.
A cross from Bernardo Silva found the Belgian who slotted the ball into the back of David De Gea’s net.
It wasn’t long until City restored their lead however, Again, it was De Bruyne with the goal as he lashed home a loose ball following some pinball inside the United penalty area.
Efforts from Phil Foden and Silva were blocked before De Bruyne scored.
It was then all one-way traffic as City continued to press for a third with unsuccesful chances from Foden and Mahrez in the final stages of the first half.
