     In Derby Without Drama, City Wins a Laugher
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It had gone long before the fourth goal arrived, marking the point at which victory turned into a rout.
Instead, in the final few minutes of a derby, Manchester City’s fans could let go and enjoy themselves.
Instead, City’s fans seemed light, playful.
City had imported it a decade ago, after a Europa League trip to Poland, but its popularity had waned.
The Manchester derby still has some of that: Midway through the first half, after Jadon Sancho had drawn Manchester United even, he had celebrated in the eye-line of one fan, in particular, who greeted him with puce-faced rage.

     Summary: Man United 'had no belief in second half' in derby loss vs. Man City (1:45)Kevin De Bruyne said Manchester United's difficulties in adjusting to Ralf Rangnick's pressing style might have contributed to the view that they threw in the towel towards the end of the derby defeat to Manchester City.
"First half it was a bit more difficult, they pressed us a bit higher than they normally do but in the second half we found the spaces where we needed to be.
Kevin De Bruyne in action for Manchester City during their 4-1 win over Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.
"On Saturday I was at home so I saw the second half [of Liverpool vs. West Ham].
"It's so far away, there's a lot of important games in between," De Bruyne said.

     Summary: At the end of Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s run as Manchester United, they got absolutely dog-walked by Liverpool and Manchester City at home.
AdvertisementSome five months later, his replacement, Ralf Ran gnick, took United across town to City.
The only improvement was the first 20 minutes, where United scored and looked threatening on the counter.
Ran gnick, who basically invented the Red Bull style of play, came in trying to install his 4-2-2-2, “hell’s coming to breakfast” pressing style.
They completely gave up in the second half, as they’ve done a lot under Ran gnick.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MANCHESTER -- It was the most commonly repeated critique of Manchester United.
"This is Manchester United Football Club," the old cliche goes.
City might have inevitably moved through the gears as they eventually did in the second half, reaching a level few can reach, certainly not United.
"If the second half is not our best, I don't know what we have to do," said Guardiola.
"I can forgive mistakes, but not running back, not trying to tackle - there are players out there who shouldn't play for Manchester United again."
