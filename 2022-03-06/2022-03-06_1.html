     In Derby Without Drama, City Wins a Laugher
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It had gone long before the fourth goal arrived, marking the point at which victory turned into a rout.
Instead, in the final few minutes of a derby, Manchester City’s fans could let go and enjoy themselves.
Instead, City’s fans seemed light, playful.
City had imported it a decade ago, after a Europa League trip to Poland, but its popularity had waned.
The Manchester derby still has some of that: Midway through the first half, after Jadon Sancho had drawn Manchester United even, he had celebrated in the eye-line of one fan, in particular, who greeted him with puce-faced rage.

In the first half we created good angles, moved the ball away and created chances.
But the disappointing thing is how sloppy we were in the second half.
“It comes down to individuals, concentration and how we deal with the expectation of playing for Man United.
We need to win in the Champions League and get in the top four, that’s all I’m thinking about.

     Manchester United face city rivals Manchester City in another chapter of the Manchester derby this Sunday, with both teams needing points.
Many predicted lineups had Ronaldo slotted in to lead the United attack, and without Cavani (groin), Anthony Elanga and Jadon Sancho will carry the attack.
He returned to training and Rangnick made it sound like he'd be part of the squad against Man City in the lead-up.
Luke ShawInjury: COVID-19COVID-19 Out since: March 2Rangnick confirmed that the left back is out for the match against Manchester City after picking up COVID-19 in midweek.

     Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez both scored twice as Manchester City turned in a convincing 4-1 win over Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday.
Man City wasted no time opening the scoring early through De Bruyne, who calmly finished past David De Gea from a Bernardo Silva cutback on five minutes.
Jadon Sancho drew Manchester United level a little over 15 minutes later, cutting onto his right foot and curling a lovely shot inside Ederson's far post to make it 1-1.
United were without Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani through injuries as Ralf Rangnick opted to play Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes in forward positions to little effect.
City have 69 points from 28 games with Liverpool on 63 from 27 matches.

     Two goals each from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez helped Manchester City cruise to comfortable win against rivals Manchester United in the cold March sun.
A cross from Bernardo Silva found the Belgian who slotted the ball into the back of David De Gea’s net.
It wasn’t long until City restored their lead however, Again, it was De Bruyne with the goal as he lashed home a loose ball following some pinball inside the United penalty area.
Efforts from Phil Foden and Silva were blocked before De Bruyne scored.
It was then all one-way traffic as City continued to press for a third with unsuccesful chances from Foden and Mahrez in the final stages of the first half.
