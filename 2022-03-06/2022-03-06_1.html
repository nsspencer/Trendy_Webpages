     UB, Bonnies head into conference tournament week with March Madness on their minds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Both the UB and St. Bonaventure men's basketball teams are ready to start conference tournaments, looking to punch their ticket to the NCAA tournament.
BUFFALO, N.Y. — It's officially conference tournament time, so let's check in with two of our local men's basketball teams and see what is in store for them as they look to punch their ticket to the March Madness tournament.
With their victory, the Bonnies officially clinch the fourth spot in the Atlantic 10 conference tournament, which gives them a double-bye and plenty of time to rest and prepare.
As far as their odds to make it to the NCAA's March Madness tournament, according to teamrankings.com, UB is sitting at a 13 percent chance to make it, and the Bonnies just slightly higher at 14 percent.
But don't let numbers fool you, both of these teams can make a deep postseason run in their conference tournaments.

     Press Box: March is already off to a roaring start in basketball
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Here at the News Tribune, we have already started to see this in Mid-Missouri high school basketball.
Helias’ boys and girls teams clinched their spots in the state tournament with district title victories Friday.
Of the 31 teams that won regular-season conference titles last season, only 17 went on to clinch the automatic bid into the NCAA Tournament by winning its conference tournament championship.
This brings extra intrigue into not only the mid-major conference tournaments, but to Selection Sunday.
1 overall seed has only won the NCAA Tournament three times since 2004, with Florida winning in 2007, Kentucky in 2012 and Louisville the next year in 2013.
