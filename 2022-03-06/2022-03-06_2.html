     At Least 7 Killed as Tornadoes Rampage Across Iowa, Officials Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     At least seven people were killed, including two children, in Iowa on Saturday as communities across the state were battered by tornadoes, the authorities said.
Six of the deaths occurred in Madison County, and a seventh was reported southeast of Chariton, a city in Lucas County, officials said.
In Madison County, southwest of Des Moines, four adults were injured, three of whom were in serious condition and one who had life-threatening injuries, said Diogenes Ayala, the director of the Madison County Emergency Management Agency.
“The best thing the community can do is just to not go to these areas,” Mr. Ayala said at a news conference late Saturday.
“Let people that are living there — let them clean up.

     Tornado kills 7, including 2 children, near Des Moines, Iowa, officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Seven people, including two children, died in a tornado near Des Moines, Iowa, Saturday, officials said.
The two children who died were under the age of five, Madison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said.
"This is, I think, the worst anyone has seen in quite a long time," Ayala said.
The tornado, which ripped through multiple counties near Des Moines, also left one adult with life-threatening injuries and three others hospitalized in serious condition, Ayala said.
The National Weather Service office in Des Moines said an initial estimate shows it was an EF3 tornado, with wind speeds of at least 136 miles per hour.

     Officials: 7 killed as tornado tore through central Iowa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     3/6/22DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Seven people were killed, including two children, when a tornado swept through central Iowa, damaging buildings and knocking down trees and power lines, authorities said.
Emergency management officials in Madison County said four were injured and six people were killed Saturday when the tornado touched down in the area southwest of Des Moines at about 4:30 p.m.
Thunderstorms that spawned tornadoes moved through much of Iowa from the afternoon until Saturday night with storms also causing damage in the Des Moines suburb of Norwalk, areas just east of Des Moines and other areas of eastern Iowa.
At one point, power outages affected about 10,000 in the Des Moines area.
It said weather service teams would investigate the damage Sunday and further assess a potential rating.
