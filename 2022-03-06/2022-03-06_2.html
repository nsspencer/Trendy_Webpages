     Iowa gov. issues disaster proclamation after deadly tornado
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     'Our hearts go out to all those affected by the deadly storms that tore through our state today'Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation allowing the use of state resources for assistance after a tornado tore through central Iowa on Saturday and killed six people, including a number of children.
The natural disaster struck southwest of Des Moines at around 4:30 pm, Madison County’s emergency management officials said.
At least four others were injured as the tornado swept through the area, tearing up power lines and damaging trees.
“Our hearts go out to all those affected by the deadly storms that tore through our state today,” Reynolds said, according to the Associated Press.
The tornado also caused electrical outages across Iowa's capital city, at one point impacting approximately 10,000 buildings around Des Moines.
