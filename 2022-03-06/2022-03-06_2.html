     'Outlander' Season 6 Is Finally Here, but Where Can I Watch the Show?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     If you don't have the Starz app, the channel is also available with a subscription to Philo (for an extra $9/month) and fuboTV (available for $5/month for the first three months).
While Netflix does not have current seasons on its platform yet, Seasons 1-4 are available to binge with a Netflix subscription in case you need to get caught up on the action.
It's also likely that as soon as Season 6 premieres, Season 5 will be available on the platform as well.

     'Outlander' Characters Through the Different Eras: Photos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Throughout Outlander’s tenure, Claire Randall and the rest of the Fraser family have traveled through time — from 18th century Scotland to 20th century America.
There, she meets chivalrous Scottish warrior Jamie Fraser (Sam Heughan) and the rest of the Outlander characters.
While the Men in Kilts alum’s character has remained in the past timeline, he’s also been able to experience different settings.
During season 5, Jamie and Claire ended up shipwrecked amid their travels home, which brought them to Revolutionary War-era America.
It was great to have the writer and director’s ear, to work closely with them to get the best out of the story.”Scroll below to see photos of the Outlander characters throughout the different time periods and settings:

     Everything To Remember From Outlander Season 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Revolutionary War looms for the Fraser family in Outlander Season 6.
Balfe added that after the brutal events of Season 5 — which saw her kidnapped and sexually assaulted — Claire is struggling to cope.
Jamie, Roger, and Ian (John Bell) kill all the men and save her, while Marsali kills Lionel with a lethal injection.
But when they travel through the stones, they end up right back at Fraser’s Ridge, seemingly confirming that their true home is in the past with their family.
In Season 5, he returns to Fraser’s Ridge in Native American garb, clearly depressed about something.

     Outlander Season 6 Cast Guide: Every New &amp; Returning Character
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Revolution is coming to Fraser’s Ridge in Outlander season 6, and a new cast of characters is joining Claire and Jamie’s story.
Although Outlander season 6 will only have eight episodes, the season looks to be filled with plenty more time-traveling adventures.
Here is a breakdown of Outlander season 6 cast and characters for the season premiere on Starz on March 6, 2022.
Outlander season 5 began with Roger and Bree’s wedding and ended with Roger, previously a gentle, bookish character, participating in the massacre in order to save Claire—a choice that will likely have a large effect on his Outlander season 6 character.
The time-traveler, Wendigo Donner (played by Brennan Martin), will likely be returning to the Outlander season 6 cast as will Lionel's brother, Richard Brown (Chris Larkin).

     Outlander Season 6 Premiere Recap Episode 1: Echoes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     All of this leads us to Tom Christie.
Mainly, it’s that Tom Christie, also a prisoner at Ardsmuir after Culloden, is a real dick.
It’s a dang shame because Tom Christie is trouble from the start.
Tom Christie agrees his trash son should be punished, but he asks if instead of taking him away, they can just take care of it there.
Just add him to the long list of people on Fraser’s Ridge who we need to be concerned about.
