     Manchester United's Ralf Rangnick says squad lack mental strength - sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ralf Rangnick faces a battle to get Manchester United in the Champions League.
But sources have told ESPN that only McTominay and Shaw have been able to raise their performance sufficiently when United have fallen behind or lost the lead in games.
Sources have said that some players have become distracted by mistakes, which has impacted on their performance, while others have allowed frustrations with teammates and tactics to affect their focus and contribution.
Rangnick has been impressed, however, by the character and leadership displayed by McTominay and Shaw during difficult periods on the pitch and regards both players as possessing the attributes required in such circumstances.
Shaw missed Sunday's defeat at City due to a positive COVID-19 test, but McTominay played for 90 minutes in midfield.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At the end of Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s run as Manchester United, they got absolutely dog-walked by Liverpool and Manchester City at home.
AdvertisementSome five months later, his replacement, Ralf Ran gnick, took United across town to City.
The only improvement was the first 20 minutes, where United scored and looked threatening on the counter.
Ran gnick, who basically invented the Red Bull style of play, came in trying to install his 4-2-2-2, “hell’s coming to breakfast” pressing style.
They completely gave up in the second half, as they’ve done a lot under Ran gnick.

     Summary: MANCHESTER -- It was the most commonly repeated critique of Manchester United.
"This is Manchester United Football Club," the old cliche goes.
City might have inevitably moved through the gears as they eventually did in the second half, reaching a level few can reach, certainly not United.
"If the second half is not our best, I don't know what we have to do," said Guardiola.
"I can forgive mistakes, but not running back, not trying to tackle - there are players out there who shouldn't play for Manchester United again."

     Summary: March 6, 2022 at 2:21 PM EST“We gave the ball away too much in the second half and found it difficult to get it back.
In the first half we created good angles, moved the ball away and created chances.
But the disappointing thing is how sloppy we were in the second half.
“It comes down to individuals, concentration and how we deal with the expectation of playing for Man United.
We need to win in the Champions League and get in the top four, that’s all I’m thinking about.
