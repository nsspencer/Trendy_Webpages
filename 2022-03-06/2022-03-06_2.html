     If you don't have the Starz app, the channel is also available with a subscription to Philo (for an extra $9/month) and fuboTV (available for $5/month for the first three months).
While Netflix does not have current seasons on its platform yet, Seasons 1-4 are available to binge with a Netflix subscription in case you need to get caught up on the action.
It's also likely that as soon as Season 6 premieres, Season 5 will be available on the platform as well.

     'Outlander' Fans, the Starz Show Just Revealed What's Happening Next After Season 6 Episodes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Outlander fans, the historical drama is far from being over.
While the latest story unfolds in the new episodes based on Diana Gabaldon's book , Variety has reported that there is an Outlander prequel is in the works courtesy of showrunner Matthew B. Roberts.
According to the outlet, he will executive produce and write Outlander prequel with the help of a writers' room, which is set "to begin work in the coming weeks."
About a year before Outlander debuted its season 6, STARZ renewed the show for season 7 back in March 2021.
In the present, Outlander season 6 will feature Claire and Jamie living in the new world and settled in the British colonies.

     Will Outlander Get a Season 8?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After a prolonged Droughtlander due to the COVID-19 pandemic, season six of Outlander, the beloved time-travel series, is finally here.
But some fans are already thinking way, way ahead.
While the show has been renewed for a seventh season already, it's unclear if there might be a season eight.
And if Starz and Sony are willing, we're willing, and if the actors are willing, we'll keep going."
Outlander's seventh season will presumably focus in on Diana Gabaldon's seventh book in the Outlander series, An Echo in the Bone—so season eight could be an adaptation of her eighth novel, Written in My Own Heart's Blood.

     What to Watch: Outlander finally returns for season 6, ending the longest Droughtlander ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     At last, the longest Droughtlander on record is coming to an end — even if it's a shorter season than fans would like.
Outlander returns for season 6, picking up not long after the events of the brutal season 5 finale, which saw Claire (Caitriona Balfe) kidnapped, gang-raped, and rescued by Jamie (Sam Heughan) and his men.
Meanwhile, Roger (Richard Rankin) and Brianna (Sophie Skelton) must once again try to cope with life in the past after their attempt to return to the future was foiled.
There's no rest for the weary on Fraser's Ridge as season 6 sees the introduction of a host of new settlers, including the brooding Christie family whose patriarch, Tom, has a thorny connection to Jamie and his days in Ardsmuir Prison.
Life in the past is never easy, and the Fraser family must once again face a host of dangers as Outlander returns to Starz.

     'Outlander' Characters Through the Different Eras: Photos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Throughout Outlander’s tenure, Claire Randall and the rest of the Fraser family have traveled through time — from 18th century Scotland to 20th century America.
There, she meets chivalrous Scottish warrior Jamie Fraser (Sam Heughan) and the rest of the Outlander characters.
While the Men in Kilts alum’s character has remained in the past timeline, he’s also been able to experience different settings.
During season 5, Jamie and Claire ended up shipwrecked amid their travels home, which brought them to Revolutionary War-era America.
It was great to have the writer and director’s ear, to work closely with them to get the best out of the story.”Scroll below to see photos of the Outlander characters throughout the different time periods and settings:

     Outlander Season 6 Cast Guide: Every New &amp; Returning Character
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Revolution is coming to Fraser’s Ridge in Outlander season 6, and a new cast of characters is joining Claire and Jamie’s story.
Although Outlander season 6 will only have eight episodes, the season looks to be filled with plenty more time-traveling adventures.
Here is a breakdown of Outlander season 6 cast and characters for the season premiere on Starz on March 6, 2022.
Outlander season 5 began with Roger and Bree’s wedding and ended with Roger, previously a gentle, bookish character, participating in the massacre in order to save Claire—a choice that will likely have a large effect on his Outlander season 6 character.
The time-traveler, Wendigo Donner (played by Brennan Martin), will likely be returning to the Outlander season 6 cast as will Lionel's brother, Richard Brown (Chris Larkin).
