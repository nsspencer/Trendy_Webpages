     'Outlander' Fans, the Starz Show Just Revealed What's Happening Next After Season 6 Episodes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Outlander fans, the historical drama is far from being over.
While the latest story unfolds in the new episodes based on Diana Gabaldon's book , Variety has reported that there is an Outlander prequel is in the works courtesy of showrunner Matthew B. Roberts.
According to the outlet, he will executive produce and write Outlander prequel with the help of a writers' room, which is set "to begin work in the coming weeks."
About a year before Outlander debuted its season 6, STARZ renewed the show for season 7 back in March 2021.
In the present, Outlander season 6 will feature Claire and Jamie living in the new world and settled in the British colonies.

     Will Outlander Get a Season 8?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After a prolonged Droughtlander due to the COVID-19 pandemic, season six of Outlander, the beloved time-travel series, is finally here.
But some fans are already thinking way, way ahead.
While the show has been renewed for a seventh season already, it's unclear if there might be a season eight.
And if Starz and Sony are willing, we're willing, and if the actors are willing, we'll keep going."
Outlander's seventh season will presumably focus in on Diana Gabaldon's seventh book in the Outlander series, An Echo in the Bone—so season eight could be an adaptation of her eighth novel, Written in My Own Heart's Blood.

     Club: What was it like coming back for season six after a long break, and what was it like to step into Claire’s mindset this time?
Caitriona Balfe: First of all, we were so excited to get back to work.
You’ve been a producer since season five; did you get to have some more input on how you wanted to see Claire’s story unravel?
You’ll see that Brianna will be an integral part of Claire’s recovery as the episodes go along.
Claire really feels for her.

     ‘Outlander’ producer teases ‘heartbreaking’ times ahead after season 6 premiere
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Hunter IngramStarNews CorrespondentWar takes many forms and the residents of Fraser’s Ridge have just been made soldiers in a few of them.
“It is quite a traumatic season for her,” Davis said.
“We will slowly find as the season progresses that their home is turning against them,” she said.
“Interesting enough, I think book 6 is now the only book that spans three seasons,” Davis said, acknowledging the irony that it is also the longest of Gabaldon’s books at 1,157 pages.
To learn more about the Colonial North Carolina history featured in "Outlander," listen to the new podcast "Burgwin-Wright Presents... Outlander in the Cape Fear."

     After agreeing, Jamie is ushered out the door, but not before he notices Christie and the governor oddly shake hands.
The neighborhood crime watch team, led by the horrible Richard Brown, brother to the horrendous (and deceased) Lionel Brown, is prowling the woods again.
After adamantly shutting him down, the Major lets it slip that it will go to Richard Brown if Jamie doesn't take the position.
And Jamie corners Major MacDonald, clarifying that he will take the job of the Indian Agent if it means Richard Brown will not get the job.
I don't care what Claire tells Jamie and Bree, but this is not the definition of someone who is feeling fine.

     All of this leads us to Tom Christie.
Mainly, it’s that Tom Christie, also a prisoner at Ardsmuir after Culloden, is a real dick.
It’s a dang shame because Tom Christie is trouble from the start.
Tom Christie agrees his trash son should be punished, but he asks if instead of taking him away, they can just take care of it there.
Just add him to the long list of people on Fraser’s Ridge who we need to be concerned about.
