     If you don't have the Starz app, the channel is also available with a subscription to Philo (for an extra $9/month) and fuboTV (available for $5/month for the first three months).
While Netflix does not have current seasons on its platform yet, Seasons 1-4 are available to binge with a Netflix subscription in case you need to get caught up on the action.
It's also likely that as soon as Season 6 premieres, Season 5 will be available on the platform as well.

     Outlander Season 6 Premiere Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Outlander's Season 6 premiere arrives Sunday, March 6 on Starz.
Outlander: Season 6 Gallery 17 Images"Echoes" does was an Outlander premiere should do, which is give us peace while signaling dread.
Fraser's Ridge is indeed beset on all sides, and while the new addition of Christie surely foreshadows turbulent times, there are other enemies lurking within: namely addiction.
Claire and Jamie's relationship is still as sweet and otherworldly as ever but it's good that we're shown the aftereffects of Season 5's harrowing ordeal.
The main outside threat here in Season 6 -- aside from the war on the horizon -- was established back in Season 5.

     What to Watch: Outlander finally returns for season 6, ending the longest Droughtlander ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     At last, the longest Droughtlander on record is coming to an end — even if it's a shorter season than fans would like.
Outlander returns for season 6, picking up not long after the events of the brutal season 5 finale, which saw Claire (Caitriona Balfe) kidnapped, gang-raped, and rescued by Jamie (Sam Heughan) and his men.
Meanwhile, Roger (Richard Rankin) and Brianna (Sophie Skelton) must once again try to cope with life in the past after their attempt to return to the future was foiled.
There's no rest for the weary on Fraser's Ridge as season 6 sees the introduction of a host of new settlers, including the brooding Christie family whose patriarch, Tom, has a thorny connection to Jamie and his days in Ardsmuir Prison.
Life in the past is never easy, and the Fraser family must once again face a host of dangers as Outlander returns to Starz.

     Jamie, Claire and their family at Fraser’s Ridge are facing much more than the coming of the American Revolution as “Outlander” returns for Season 6 Sunday night on Starz.
And I do think because it’s a condensed season, you feel it more in this [season].
Whereas Claire and Jamie kind of learned it in Season 1 and Season 2.
And I think that’s where Jamie and Claire’s relationship is this season.
… And I think Claire was so scared that she would lose that because it’s so sacred.

     Outlander Season 6 Cast Guide: Every New &amp; Returning Character
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Revolution is coming to Fraser’s Ridge in Outlander season 6, and a new cast of characters is joining Claire and Jamie’s story.
Although Outlander season 6 will only have eight episodes, the season looks to be filled with plenty more time-traveling adventures.
Here is a breakdown of Outlander season 6 cast and characters for the season premiere on Starz on March 6, 2022.
Outlander season 5 began with Roger and Bree’s wedding and ended with Roger, previously a gentle, bookish character, participating in the massacre in order to save Claire—a choice that will likely have a large effect on his Outlander season 6 character.
The time-traveler, Wendigo Donner (played by Brennan Martin), will likely be returning to the Outlander season 6 cast as will Lionel's brother, Richard Brown (Chris Larkin).
