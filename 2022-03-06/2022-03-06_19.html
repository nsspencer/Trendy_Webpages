At least 364 Ukrainians have died since Russia invaded Ukraine and at least 759 have been injured, according to the United Nations.
Western powers are in talks about a ban on Russian oil and gas imports.
The Biden administration fears what that could mean for gas prices, but an energy imports ban would also deprive Russia of a large source of revenue.

     Stakes Rise as Putin Says His War in Ukraine Will Continue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine heads toward the two week mark, the stakes for both sides in the ground war look set to rise, with potentially catastrophic implications for Ukrainian civilians and greater challenges for the country’s so far remarkably successful defense.
President Vladimir Putin said again on Sunday the war will continue until Ukraine accepts his demands and halts resistance, dimming hopes for a negotiated settlement.
Putin says Ukraine must “demilitarize” and he has made clear his goal is to remove the current government.

     Russia-Ukraine war: Vladimir Putin’s ultimate goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RALEIGH, N.C. — As the war in Ukraine continues, all eyes are on Russia’s next steps and the country’s ultimate goal behind the invasion.
To provide insight, Spectrum News 1 spoke with Daniel Hamilton, a senior fellow of foreign affairs at Johns Hopkins University.
Both the White House and U.S. senators, like Marco Rubio, have made statements, appearing to question Putin’s mental health after two years of pandemic isolation.
“How could anybody really logically think, even Putin, think that he will get away with this.
Hamilton also pointed out that Putin, being 69 years old, may be considering the legacy he will leave behind.

     Zelenskyy: Ukraine will not forgive Russia for invasion, shelling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine will not forgive Russia for all the casualties and sufferings the war it started had caused, accusing Russian forces of targeting civilians.
Irpin is at war, Irpin has not surrendered,” Oleksandr Markushyn said on Telegram, adding that part of the city was in Russian hands.
Ukraine and Western countries have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for the invasion.
The West has broadly backed Ukraine, offering aid and weapon shipments and slapping Russia with vast sanctions.
More than 1.5 million people have left the country, in what the UN has called Europe’s fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II.

     More than 4,300 people arrested at anti-war protests across Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny had called for protest across Russia and the rest of the world after the Russian invasion, which began on 24 February.
But Russia’s interior ministry warned on Saturday that any attempt to hold unauthorised protests would be prevented and the organisers held to account.
Photograph: Pavel Mikheyev/ReutersVideos posted on social media showed about 2,000 people had attended an anti-war protest in Kazakhstan’s biggest city, Almaty.
“Because of Putin, Russia now means war for many people,” Navalny said on Friday.
Putin’s rating rose six percentage points to 70% in the week to 27 February, according to the state pollster VTsIOM.

     Ukraine crisis: Russian President Vladimir Putin cornered over invasion 'miscalculation' - how will he react?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vladimir Putin would have wanted to take Kyiv in just a couple of days – but he seems to be increasingly cornered.
Sky News has spoken to experts about how the Russian President may react next as the war in Ukraine enters day 11.
"He really needs to maintain a narrative, which at the moment is to stop NATO expansionism and is all about the security of Russia.
He added Russia may have been "overconfident" about the invasion, but ultimately "underestimated the Ukrainians".
So we need to expand the diplomatic pressure, but let's not get distracted by the propaganda of Putin."

     Summary: Russian and Ukrainian forces had agreed to an 11-hour cease-fire Sunday, but Ukrainian officials said Russian attacks quickly closed the safe-passage corridor.
A third round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian leaders was planned for Monday.
A day earlier, Ukrainian officials similarly said Russian artillery fire and airstrikes had prevented residents from leaving.
Russian forces launched hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks across the country, including powerful bombs dropped on residential areas of Chernihiv, a city north of the capital of Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said.
Ukrainian forces were also defending Odesa, Ukraines largest port city, from Russian ships, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said.
