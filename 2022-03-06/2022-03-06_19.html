     Russia-Ukraine war: Vladimir Putin’s ultimate goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RALEIGH, N.C. — As the war in Ukraine continues, all eyes are on Russia’s next steps and the country’s ultimate goal behind the invasion.
To provide insight, Spectrum News 1 spoke with Daniel Hamilton, a senior fellow of foreign affairs at Johns Hopkins University.
Both the White House and U.S. senators, like Marco Rubio, have made statements, appearing to question Putin’s mental health after two years of pandemic isolation.
“How could anybody really logically think, even Putin, think that he will get away with this.
Hamilton also pointed out that Putin, being 69 years old, may be considering the legacy he will leave behind.

     Thousands arrested across Russia at anti-war protests
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Police detained more than 4,300 people on Sunday at Russia-wide protests against President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to an independent protest monitoring group.
Thousands of protesters chanted “No to war!” and “Shame on you!”, according to videos posted on social media by opposition activists and bloggers.
Jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny had called for protests on Sunday across Russia and the rest of the world against the invasion.
“Because of Putin, Russia now means war for many people,” Navalny said on Friday.
Putin’s approval ratings have jumped in Russia since the invasion, according to Moscow-based pollsters.

     'Stop fighting...': Vladimir Putin warns Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered an ominous warning Sunday, telling Ukraine the 'military operation' that has killed hundreds (potentially thousands) already would only stop if Kyiv laid down arms and met all of the Kremlin's demands.
But a belligerent Moscow has insisted its attacks will not end till Ukraine's military capabilities are destroyed and the country purged of 'neo Nazis'.

Two rounds of talks have yielded no result, with Moscow determined to pummel Kyiv into submission and Ukraine's military keeping invading forces' at bay.

     Civilian toll mounts in Ukraine as world leaders raise question of war crimes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: War in Ukraine: What you need to knowThe latest: As the conflict enters its 12th day, Ukraine is set to contest on Monday Russia’s “genocide” claims that have been used to justify its invasion at the World Court.
Maps: Russia’s assault on Ukraine has been extensive with strikes and attacks across the entire country.
The fight: Casualties are mounting in Ukraine — including civilians, while Moscow is facing allegations that it has used cluster and vacuum weapons.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. is “looking actively” at helping supply Ukraine with fighter jets.
The response: Russia’s war could be a global economic “game changer,” with rising gas prices and shifting trade decisions suggesting change that will be felt for years.

     Opinion | After Putin's Invasion, My Country Has Shown Its True Colors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From the start of this large-scale war, Ukrainians have made clear that they are not just fighting for their country, but in fact defending Europe.
But it’s important to be clear that Ukraine’s qualifications to join these communities do not come from Putin’s invasion.
Putin’s invasion should be seen as his recognition of Ukraine’s achievements — the same achievements that qualify it to join the community of European democracies.
Right now, facing the large-scale Russian invasion, what we expect from the world is large-scale punishment for Russia and large-scale support for Ukraine.
But with Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion, we’ve moved to a black and white picture, without any shades of gray.

     Nuclear Fears Intensify As Ukraine War Builds. What Is Putin's Threshold?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If Russia's campaign stalls again, nuclear weapons could wind up being a fallback option for Putin.
Read more Exclusive: Ukraine Crisis Could Lead to Nuclear War Under New Strategy Exclusive: Ukraine Crisis Could Lead to Nuclear War Under New StrategyThe notion that nuclear war, despite the situation in Ukraine, is still a low-probability event offers little solace, however.
At issue in Ukraine is not so much ICBMs as "tactical" nuclear weapons delivered on short or medium range missiles.
"Nuclear weapons are back, but they never really went away," says Caitlin Talmadge, Associate Professor of Security Studies at Georgetown University.
"What's new in the present era is that the three great powers with nuclear weapons are entering a period of renewed competitive relationships.
