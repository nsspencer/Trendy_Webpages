     Russia-Ukraine war: Vladimir Putin’s ultimate goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RALEIGH, N.C. — As the war in Ukraine continues, all eyes are on Russia’s next steps and the country’s ultimate goal behind the invasion.
To provide insight, Spectrum News 1 spoke with Daniel Hamilton, a senior fellow of foreign affairs at Johns Hopkins University.
Both the White House and U.S. senators, like Marco Rubio, have made statements, appearing to question Putin’s mental health after two years of pandemic isolation.
“How could anybody really logically think, even Putin, think that he will get away with this.
Hamilton also pointed out that Putin, being 69 years old, may be considering the legacy he will leave behind.

     Woman, fetus die after migrants abandoned in truck in Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mexican authorities say a pregnant woman and her unborn child died after dozens of migrants were abandoned in an overheated freight truck in northern MexicoMEXICO CITY -- A pregnant woman and her unborn child died and 14 people were hospitalized, most for severe dehydration, after dozens of migrants were abandoned in an overheated freight truck in northern Mexico, authorities said Sunday.
Immigration officials said 64 migrants were found in the freight container, where temperatures reached over 100 degrees (40 Celsius).
There might have been more migrants jammed in the vehicle, but authorities said some might have fled.
The National Immigration Institute said the truck was found Saturday in the northern border state of Coahuila.
The agency said it “condemns the fact that ‘guides’ and traffickers profit from and endanger the lives of migrants.” It said it would grant humanitarian visas to the migrants, as is often done in Mexico when migrants are considered victims of a crime.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Police detained more than 4,300 people on Sunday at Russia-wide protests against President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to an independent protest monitoring group.
Thousands of protesters chanted “No to war!” and “Shame on you!”, according to videos posted on social media by opposition activists and bloggers.
Jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny had called for protests on Sunday across Russia and the rest of the world against the invasion.
“Because of Putin, Russia now means war for many people,” Navalny said on Friday.
Putin’s approval ratings have jumped in Russia since the invasion, according to Moscow-based pollsters.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered an ominous warning Sunday, telling Ukraine the 'military operation' that has killed hundreds (potentially thousands) already would only stop if Kyiv laid down arms and met all of the Kremlin's demands.
But a belligerent Moscow has insisted its attacks will not end till Ukraine's military capabilities are destroyed and the country purged of 'neo Nazis'.

     Riot at Mexico soccer match leaves three people in critical condition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Three people were in critical condition on Sunday after violent clashes at a soccer match in the Mexican state of Queretaro left more than two dozen people hospitalized, and officials said they would prosecute some assailants for attempted murder.
“Even though there are no deaths, we can’t say this isn’t a tragedy,” Queretaro Governor Mauricio Kuri told a news conference.
Soccer fans on Saturday stormed the pitch during a top flight match between mid-table Queretaro and last year’s Liga MX champions Atlas.
(Foto: Twitter/@PelonGomis)The regional governing Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), which includes Mexico’s Liga MX, on Sunday called on authorities to investigate the attacks.
Liga MX suspended Saturday’s match after 62 minutes with visitors Atlas leading 1-0, and also called off planned games for Sunday.

     Civilian toll mounts in Ukraine as world leaders raise question of war crimes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: War in Ukraine: What you need to knowThe latest: As the conflict enters its 12th day, Ukraine is set to contest on Monday Russia’s “genocide” claims that have been used to justify its invasion at the World Court.
Maps: Russia’s assault on Ukraine has been extensive with strikes and attacks across the entire country.
The fight: Casualties are mounting in Ukraine — including civilians, while Moscow is facing allegations that it has used cluster and vacuum weapons.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. is “looking actively” at helping supply Ukraine with fighter jets.
The response: Russia’s war could be a global economic “game changer,” with rising gas prices and shifting trade decisions suggesting change that will be felt for years.

     Opinion | After Putin's Invasion, My Country Has Shown Its True Colors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From the start of this large-scale war, Ukrainians have made clear that they are not just fighting for their country, but in fact defending Europe.
But it’s important to be clear that Ukraine’s qualifications to join these communities do not come from Putin’s invasion.
Putin’s invasion should be seen as his recognition of Ukraine’s achievements — the same achievements that qualify it to join the community of European democracies.
Right now, facing the large-scale Russian invasion, what we expect from the world is large-scale punishment for Russia and large-scale support for Ukraine.
But with Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion, we’ve moved to a black and white picture, without any shades of gray.

     Mexico suspends league soccer matches after massive brawl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s top-division soccer league suspended all matches scheduled for Sunday after a huge brawl among fans during the previous day's match between host Queretaro and Atlas from Guadalajara, the reigning league champion.
“We regret and condemn these events, which run contrary to the spirit of our soccer,” the Mexican Soccer Federation said in a statement.
Queretaro state authorities said 23 remained hospitalized.
“The darkest day for Mexican soccer,” was the front-page headline in the Mexican newspaper El Universal on Sunday.
In fact, violence between gangs of rival soccer fans is commonplace at stadiums in Mexico.

     Mexico soccer riot: Latest fallout after violence between Queretaro, Atlas supporters causes Liga MX suspension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Queretaro state governor, Mauricio Kuri, promised an in-depth investigation, but he also pointed the finger at the club.
It was obvious that they did what they wanted to do with us," said an Atlas fan in a TV interview.
Liga MX taking actionIn the hours after the incidents, Liga MX followed up with a statement confirming the opening of an investigation, the activation of the league's Disciplinary Commission to begin the sanctioning process, and the pursuit of criminal complaints as necessary.
Despite calls to immediately suspend play around the league, the Liga MX matches scheduled for later Saturday night moved forward as planned.
But after their conclusion, Liga MX announced the suspension of all men's and women's professional matches on the slate through at least March 8.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If Russia's campaign stalls again, nuclear weapons could wind up being a fallback option for Putin.

At issue in Ukraine is not so much ICBMs as "tactical" nuclear weapons delivered on short or medium range missiles.
"Nuclear weapons are back, but they never really went away," says Caitlin Talmadge, Associate Professor of Security Studies at Georgetown University.
