To provide insight, Spectrum News 1 spoke with Daniel Hamilton, a senior fellow of foreign affairs at Johns Hopkins University.
Both the White House and U.S. senators, like Marco Rubio, have made statements, appearing to question Putin’s mental health after two years of pandemic isolation.
“How could anybody really logically think, even Putin, think that he will get away with this.

     Summary: Police detained more than 4,300 people on Sunday at Russia-wide protests against President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to an independent protest monitoring group.
Thousands of protesters chanted “No to war!” and “Shame on you!”, according to videos posted on social media by opposition activists and bloggers.
Jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny had called for protests on Sunday across Russia and the rest of the world against the invasion.
“Because of Putin, Russia now means war for many people,” Navalny said on Friday.
Putin’s approval ratings have jumped in Russia since the invasion, according to Moscow-based pollsters.

Maps: Russia’s assault on Ukraine has been extensive with strikes and attacks across the entire country.
The fight: Casualties are mounting in Ukraine — including civilians, while Moscow is facing allegations that it has used cluster and vacuum weapons.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. is “looking actively” at helping supply Ukraine with fighter jets.
The response: Russia’s war could be a global economic “game changer,” with rising gas prices and shifting trade decisions suggesting change that will be felt for years.

     Summary: From the start of this large-scale war, Ukrainians have made clear that they are not just fighting for their country, but in fact defending Europe.
But it’s important to be clear that Ukraine’s qualifications to join these communities do not come from Putin’s invasion.
Putin’s invasion should be seen as his recognition of Ukraine’s achievements — the same achievements that qualify it to join the community of European democracies.
Right now, facing the large-scale Russian invasion, what we expect from the world is large-scale punishment for Russia and large-scale support for Ukraine.
But with Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion, we’ve moved to a black and white picture, without any shades of gray.

     Mexico suspends league soccer matches after massive brawl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s top-division soccer league suspended all matches scheduled for Sunday after a huge brawl among fans during the previous day's match between host Queretaro and Atlas from Guadalajara, the reigning league champion.
“We regret and condemn these events, which run contrary to the spirit of our soccer,” the Mexican Soccer Federation said in a statement.
Queretaro state authorities said 23 remained hospitalized.
“The darkest day for Mexican soccer,” was the front-page headline in the Mexican newspaper El Universal on Sunday.
In fact, violence between gangs of rival soccer fans is commonplace at stadiums in Mexico.

     Mexico soccer riot: Latest fallout after violence between Queretaro, Atlas supporters causes Liga MX suspension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Queretaro state governor, Mauricio Kuri, promised an in-depth investigation, but he also pointed the finger at the club.
It was obvious that they did what they wanted to do with us," said an Atlas fan in a TV interview.
Liga MX taking actionIn the hours after the incidents, Liga MX followed up with a statement confirming the opening of an investigation, the activation of the league's Disciplinary Commission to begin the sanctioning process, and the pursuit of criminal complaints as necessary.
Despite calls to immediately suspend play around the league, the Liga MX matches scheduled for later Saturday night moved forward as planned.
But after their conclusion, Liga MX announced the suspension of all men's and women's professional matches on the slate through at least March 8.
