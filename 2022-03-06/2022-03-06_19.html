     Woman, fetus die after migrants abandoned in truck in Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mexican authorities say a pregnant woman and her unborn child died after dozens of migrants were abandoned in an overheated freight truck in northern MexicoMEXICO CITY -- A pregnant woman and her unborn child died and 14 people were hospitalized, most for severe dehydration, after dozens of migrants were abandoned in an overheated freight truck in northern Mexico, authorities said Sunday.
Immigration officials said 64 migrants were found in the freight container, where temperatures reached over 100 degrees (40 Celsius).
There might have been more migrants jammed in the vehicle, but authorities said some might have fled.
The National Immigration Institute said the truck was found Saturday in the northern border state of Coahuila.
The agency said it “condemns the fact that ‘guides’ and traffickers profit from and endanger the lives of migrants.” It said it would grant humanitarian visas to the migrants, as is often done in Mexico when migrants are considered victims of a crime.

     Riot at Mexico soccer match leaves three people in critical condition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Three people were in critical condition on Sunday after violent clashes at a soccer match in the Mexican state of Queretaro left more than two dozen people hospitalized, and officials said they would prosecute some assailants for attempted murder.
“Even though there are no deaths, we can’t say this isn’t a tragedy,” Queretaro Governor Mauricio Kuri told a news conference.
Soccer fans on Saturday stormed the pitch during a top flight match between mid-table Queretaro and last year’s Liga MX champions Atlas.
(Foto: Twitter/@PelonGomis)The regional governing Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), which includes Mexico’s Liga MX, on Sunday called on authorities to investigate the attacks.
Liga MX suspended Saturday’s match after 62 minutes with visitors Atlas leading 1-0, and also called off planned games for Sunday.

     Liga MX suspended as Fifa condemns ‘barbaric’ riot that leaves dozens injured in Mexico
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     At least 26 people were injured, including three critically, on Saturday when fans brawled during a football game in central Mexico.
The Liga MX match between the hosts Queretaro and Atlas from Guadalajara was suspended in the 62nd minute when fights broke out in the stands.
Security personnel opened the gates to the field so that fans, including women and children, could escape the stands.
Other Queretaro players, including Uruguayan goalkeeper Washington Aguerre, stayed near the bench trying to calm the fans.
State authorities said some police were on duty at the stadium, but that it was largely staffed by private security officers.

     Mexico suspends league soccer matches after massive brawl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s top-division soccer league suspended all matches scheduled for Sunday after a huge brawl among fans during the previous day's match between host Queretaro and Atlas from Guadalajara, the reigning league champion.
“We regret and condemn these events, which run contrary to the spirit of our soccer,” the Mexican Soccer Federation said in a statement.
Queretaro state authorities said 23 remained hospitalized.
“The darkest day for Mexican soccer,” was the front-page headline in the Mexican newspaper El Universal on Sunday.
In fact, violence between gangs of rival soccer fans is commonplace at stadiums in Mexico.

     Mexico soccer riot: Latest fallout after violence between Queretaro, Atlas supporters causes Liga MX suspension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Queretaro state governor, Mauricio Kuri, promised an in-depth investigation, but he also pointed the finger at the club.
It was obvious that they did what they wanted to do with us," said an Atlas fan in a TV interview.
Liga MX taking actionIn the hours after the incidents, Liga MX followed up with a statement confirming the opening of an investigation, the activation of the league's Disciplinary Commission to begin the sanctioning process, and the pursuit of criminal complaints as necessary.
Despite calls to immediately suspend play around the league, the Liga MX matches scheduled for later Saturday night moved forward as planned.
But after their conclusion, Liga MX announced the suspension of all men's and women's professional matches on the slate through at least March 8.
