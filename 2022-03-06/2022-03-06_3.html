     ARSENAL have BEATEN Watford, but it was a close run thing.
Goals from Martin Odegaard, Bukayuo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli were enough to give Mikel Arteta's side all three points.

Cucho had equalised for the Hornets just moments after Odegaard's opener with a spectacular overhead kick.

     Watford vs Arsenal live score and result: Latest updates after Martinelli helps Arsenal to 3-2 Premier League win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal moved up into the top four of the Premier League after a 3-2 win against Watford at Vicarage Road.
The Gunners won their fourth game in a row to jump above Manchester United and West Ham in the table thanks to goals from Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli.
Odegaard gave Arsenal the lead after a superb passing move before Cucho Hernandez's stunning overhead kick levelled the scoring for Watford.
Bukayo Saka then regained the lead in the first half for Arsenal with a powerful finish after some great link-up with Alexandre Lacazette.
Moussa Sissoko’s late goal gave Watford hope in stoppage time, but they could not avoid an eighth straight home league defeat.

     Ball Boy Mikel Arteta Assists Classic Arsenal Goal As Young Gunners Shine In Win At Watford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal's youngsters stole the show in Sunday's 3-2 win at Watford but 39-year-old manager Mikel Arteta also played a key part in one of his side's goals.
What a beautiful goal it was too, with the final three players involved all taking just one touch.
Arteta played the role of ball boy as he quickly fed Bukayo Saka who set Arsenal on the attack with a throw-in to Cedric Soares.
That Martinelli goal made the score 3-1 to Arsenal seven minutes into the second half.
Saka had earlier set up Odegaard for Arsenal's opener, before scoring their second goal himself.

@dylanwalsh_ : "I'm not saying it's the red shorts but dear god what a terrible start for Arsenal.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal midfielder Martin Odegaard has admitted he has not thought about becoming club captain.
Odegaard, despite only joining Arsenal last January, has often been spoken about as a potential club captain.
“No, you know what, I haven’t thought about that (the Arsenal captaincy), to be honest,” Odegaard admitted to Norweigan outlet TV2.
I do my thing, but it’s not important for me.”Though Alexandre Lacazette has primarily captained Arsenal following Aubameyang’s departure, Arteta has spoken previously about Odegaard’s leadership qualities.
I talk to his national team coach and know how highly they speak of him.

     Watford vs Arsenal LIVE: Premier League result, final score and reaction - Odegaard, Saka and Martinelli win it for Gunners
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Close Arsenal stars train at Emirates before Watford testArsenal climbed back into the Premier League top four as goals from Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli helped them to a lively 3-2 win over Watford at Vicarage Road.
It was a victory more convincing for the Gunners than the scoreline suggests, as their young attacking players shone to punish a Hornets side that, to their credit, fought gamely until the end.
But a draw would have more than the Hornets deserved and their battle against relegation from the Premier League is looking like an increasingly uphill battle.
For their part, the Gunners have their top-four destiny in their own hands and three sublime finishes from Odegaard, Saka and Martinelli – all of whom should have big futures at the Emirates – demonstrated the quality Mikel Arteta can call on as the season reaches the business end.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Arsenal travel to Vicarage Road today to take on a struggling Watford side battling to stay in the Premier League.
When the two clubs met earlier this season, a 58th Emile Smith Rowe goal was the difference in a 1-0 Arsenal win.
He’s been brought in to keep Watford up, and he does that by grinding out results with turgid football.
That’s a shame too, because the combination of Emmanuel Dennis and Ismaila Sarr are a potent duo, although Sarr misses out today.
Watford will be without right back Jeremy Ngakia, centerback William Troost-Ekong, winger Ismaila Sarr, and attacker Josh King.

     Quite how they turned it into such a nail-biting finish is a mystery but Arteta’s team won for the fourth game in a row in the Premier League.
Young guns Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli are creating and scoring, and centre forward Alex Lacazette is playing as well as he has played in Arsenal colours.
Arsenal were defending as if trying to avoid contact when Watford levelled, six minutes later.
Cucho Hernandez met it with a spectacular scissor kick, sent flashing past Aaron Ramsdale in the Arsenal goal.
Watford have not taken a single point at home since they beat Manchester United in November and games are disappearing fast.
