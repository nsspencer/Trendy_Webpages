     Summary: Gasoline prices near new all-time highs.
Are gas stations price gouging?
Analysts say not but oil companies need to be careful what they say about supplies and production.
With gasoline prices poised to reach a new all-time high within days, President Joe Biden recently issued a stern warning to the nation’s oil producers and gas retailers.
“American oil and gas companies should not – should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits,” Biden said in a speech.

     Rising Gas Prices Have Drivers Asking, ‘Is This for Real?’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The extreme prices — which for some types of gas have hovered near $6 a gallon in parts of California — could be fleeting.
“The long-term impact should be somewhat minimal,” Mr. Feroli said.
Since moving to the United States from Torreón, Mexico, in 2007, Jesús López, 36, was used to gas prices rising steadily for a few days, but eventually coming back down.
Mr. López said this time felt different because he wasn’t seeing a stop to the climb when he filled up the tank of his 2008 Ford Expedition.
Mr. López, who works as a school janitor in Dallas, said that if prices kept skyrocketing, he would have to cut back on leisure activities.

     Oil Keeps Rising as Shell Pulls Back From Russian Crude Supply
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brent oil pushed higher as European oil giant Shell Plc announced it will stop buying Russian crude and the International Energy Agency said it was disappointed in the actions producers have taken in the market so far.
Futures in London rose near $127 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate also gained after settling at the highest level since 2008 on Monday.
The surge in oil has helped push retail fuel prices higher with gasoline at a record in the U.S., according to the American Automobile Association, underscoring the inflationary impact of higher energy costs.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gasoline prices are pushing even farther above $4 a gallon, the highest price that American motorists have faced since July 2008, as calls grow to ban imports of Russian oil.
In today’s terms, the record price would be equal to about $5.24 after accounting for inflation.
The increasingly violent Russian attack on Ukraine has increased calls to cut off Russia from the money it gets from oil and natural gas exports.
READ MORE: U.S. markets set for lower open; oil prices continue to surgePresident Joe Biden has been reluctant to ban Russian oil, fearing it could further fuel inflation heading into the midterm elections this November.
Talk of a ban on Russian oil has led U.S. officials to consider other sources that are currently limited.

Climbing prices at the pump are the most visible reminder of the rising cost of oil.
Rising oil prices will also show up at the grocery store.
Oil is part of many building materials and furnishings, including asphalt roof shingles, plywood and shag carpet.
Unlike gas prices, which are rarely out of view, analysts say, prices on many of those other products will creep up over weeks or months.

     Summary: Gas prices surge to above $4 a gallon, near a national recordEnlarge this image toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty ImagesOil prices surged to a 14-year high, while gasoline prices jumped past $4 a gallon to near a national record, as the U.S. and its allies discuss potential restrictions on the purchase of oil from Russia after the country invaded Ukraine.
Gasoline prices have jumped by 45 cents a gallon in the last week, to a national average of $4.06, according to AAA.
Diesel fuel prices jumped even more rapidly, to a national average of $4.61 per gallon.
If that supply were significantly curtailed, analysts have predicted that crude oil prices could possibly climb to $180 or $200 per barrel.
If ongoing talks aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal are successful, that could also give a lift to global oil supplies.

     Summary: Gas prices continue to increase because of skyrocketing oil prices related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Pretty much everyone wants to see prices lower, and there’s been a lot of talk about the “good ol’ days” when gas prices were under $2 a gallon.
Yes, gas prices had been very low a few times, but those weren’t good times.
Three significant storms battered the United States in 2017, but Hurricane Harvey had the most significant effect on gas prices.
In mid-July, oil prices ($147 a barrel) and gas prices ($4.11 a gallon) hit record highs.

     Summary: TOKYO (AP) — Oil prices jumped and shares were sharply lower Monday as the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia.
Brent crude oil briefly surged above $130 a barrel but was trading around $125 a barrel later Monday.
That potentially could free up more crude oil and ease concerns about reduced supplies from Russia.
The all-time high was marked in July 2008, when the price per barrel of U.S. crude climbed to $145.29.
