     Wisconsin men's basketball top scorer Johnny Davis injured on flagrant foul in loss to Nebraska Cornhuskers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Wisconsin's Johnny Davis is hit in the face by Nebraska's Trey McGowens and lands awkwardly under the basket in the second quarter.
(1:02)MADISON, Wis. -- Tenth-ranked Wisconsin lost leading scorer Johnny Davis when he was injured on a flagrant foul early in the second half, and the Badgers missed a chance to clinch the Big Ten title outright by falling to Nebraska 74-73 on Sunday.
Davis was hurt when he was fouled on a layup try by Trey McGowens with 17:32 left.
"I'm optimistic that he's going to be fine,'' Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said, without elaborating further on Davis' injury.
I'll leave it at that and I'll watch the replay and I'll make the necessary phone calls," Gard said.

Over that period, Nebraska went on a 10-0 run to take a 72-71 lead with 1:50 remaining.
With a chance to tie the game at the line, Hepburn missed the first before making the next two to cut the Nebraska lead to one.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     University of Wisconsin sophomore guard Johnny Davis has been ruled out for the rest of the Badgers’ regular-season finale against Nebraska after a collision at the basket.
His foot made contact with Nebraska guard Trey McGowens’ and a foul was called, but Davis continued to the basket to put up a shot.
McGowens attempted a block and missed, but his follow through brought his elbow down forcibly into Davis’ face.
Davis went to the floor and McGowens fell on top of him.
Davis went straight back to the locker room with UW trainers and didn't return to the bench.
