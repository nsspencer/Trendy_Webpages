     Kate McKinnon Slams Florida's "Don't Say Gay" Bill During "SNL"'s Weekend Update
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     During "Saturday Night Live"'s Weekend Update, cast member Kate McKinnon took on Florida's controversial "Don't Say Gay" bill, saying it might actually be a good thing.
"When I was in middle school, in the '90s, I was kind of tortured by the constant use of the word 'gay,'" explained McKinnon, who herself identifies as an openly gay person.
"I am deeply gay.
Sorry, concerned.
Deeply concerned," she responded.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The worst thing Ron DeSantis did recently wasn’t bully a bunch of students because they were wearing masks.
The Florida governor and Trump foe has proudly advanced the Parental Rights in Education bill, colloquially known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill.
You cannot say ‘gay’ in school anymore!’ I’m just so jazzed.
“I am deeply gay — sorry, concerned.
“It just feels like this is going to make kids gay and trans ― sorry, depressed and suicidal.”She then twisted the knife.

     'SNL:' Kate McKinnon blasts Florida bill about sexual orientation talk in schools
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     1/4Kate McKinnon condemned on "SNL" a Florida bill that would ban discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools in grades K-3.
Now on its way to the Florida Senate, the measure critics are calling the "don't say gay" bill bans discussions in grades K-3.
It just feels like this will make kids gay and trans.
"Does this 'don't say gay' law have a purpose?"
"I guess it's so kids don't go home with questions parents don't want to answer," Jost said.

     'SNL': Kate McKinnon Takes on Florida's "Don't Say Gay" Bill During Weekend Update
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This weekend's Saturday Night Live episode featured the evergreen Weekend Update segment, hosted by Colin Jost and Michael Che.
Another one of these contentious subjects was the Parental Rights in Education bill, most commonly known (especially by dissidents) as the 'Don't Say Gay' bill.
To discuss it, SNL regular Kate McKinnon joined Jost and, of course, injected ironic humor into the situation.
McKinnon was welcomed to the Update desk while being showered by the warm cheers and applause of the live audience.
However, the 'Don't Say Gay' bill is not devised to prevent the word from being used as an insult in schools.

     Known as the Parental Rights in Education bill but coined the "Don't Say Gay" bill by critics, the controversial legislation would allow parents greater authority to take legal action against school districts that violate the bill.
McKinnon called the bill "unconscionable," but only after Weekend Update co-anchor Colin Jost cleared up some misconceptions.
