     After deadly Iowa tornado, more severe weather could be on the way in the South, Midwest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After tornadoes slammed through the Midwest on Saturday, more severe weather could rock the South and Midwest on Sunday night into Monday.
Hail, strong winds and some strong tornadoes are possible, according to Chenard.
The regions facing severe weather risk could also see isolated to scattered flash flood risk on Sunday, while states farther east in the path of the thunderstorms could face flooding Monday into Monday night, he said.
Dan Pydynowski, senior meteorologist at Accuweather, also underscored the possibility of tornadoes and strong winds for the affected areas.
"Severe weather, heavy rainfall, strong winds are all possible today.

     Officials: 7 killed as tornado tore through central Iowa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     3/6/22DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Seven people were killed, including two children, when a tornado swept through central Iowa, damaging buildings and knocking down trees and power lines, authorities said.
Emergency management officials in Madison County said four were injured and six people were killed Saturday when the tornado touched down in the area southwest of Des Moines at about 4:30 p.m.
Thunderstorms that spawned tornadoes moved through much of Iowa from the afternoon until Saturday night with storms also causing damage in the Des Moines suburb of Norwalk, areas just east of Des Moines and other areas of eastern Iowa.
At one point, power outages affected about 10,000 in the Des Moines area.
It said weather service teams would investigate the damage Sunday and further assess a potential rating.

     Tornadoes kill 7, including 2 children, near Des Moines, Iowa, officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Seven people, including two children, died in a series of tornadoes that ripped through multiple counties near Des Moines, Iowa, Saturday, officials said.
Six Madison County residents were killed, Madison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said.
It hopes to complete a damage survey for the Winterset tornado on Monday.
The NWS said Sunday the Winterset tornado was one of at least two EF3 tornadoes to hit Iowa on Saturday.
Damage surveys from the NWS offices in Des Moines and Quad Cities suggested another EF3 with estimated winds of 138 mph was responsible for damage near Chariton, it said.

     Iowa tornado kills seven people, including two children
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Seven people were killed Saturday, including two children under the age of five, when a tornado swept through central Iowa, damaging buildings and knocking down trees and power lines, in the deadliest storm to hit the state since 2008, authorities said.
The storms are the deadliest to occur in Iowa since May 2008 when one tornado destroyed nearly 300 homes and killed nine people in the northern Iowa city of Parkersburg.
Another tornado a month later in the state killed four boys.
Saturday’s storms were not nearly as unusual as the mid-December tornado outbreak that Iowa saw last year, he said.
Power outages affected about 10,000 in the Des Moines area.

     Initial interrogation of photos and videos from around Winterset suggests at least EF3 tornado damage occurred late Saturday afternoon.
— NWS Des Moines (@NWSDesMoines) March 6, 2022Violent winds ripped through an area along Carver Road, roughly three miles outside Winterset.
At 4:03 p.m., “a confirmed tornado was located near Green Valley Lake,” warned the Weather Service in Des Moines.

Should damage surveys confirm that Saturday’s tornado was stronger than initially estimated, it would be the first EF4 tornado in the state since 2013.
