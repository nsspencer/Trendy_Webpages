     'SNL:' Kate McKinnon blasts Florida bill about sexual orientation talk in schools
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     1/4Kate McKinnon condemned on "SNL" a Florida bill that would ban discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools in grades K-3.
Now on its way to the Florida Senate, the measure critics are calling the "don't say gay" bill bans discussions in grades K-3.
It just feels like this will make kids gay and trans.
"Does this 'don't say gay' law have a purpose?"
"I guess it's so kids don't go home with questions parents don't want to answer," Jost said.

     Kate McKinnon Slams Florida's "Don't Say Gay" Bill During "SNL"'s Weekend Update
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     During "Saturday Night Live"'s Weekend Update, cast member Kate McKinnon took on Florida's controversial "Don't Say Gay" bill, saying it might actually be a good thing.
"When I was in middle school, in the '90s, I was kind of tortured by the constant use of the word 'gay,'" explained McKinnon, who herself identifies as an openly gay person.
"I am deeply gay.
Sorry, concerned.
Deeply concerned," she responded.

     SNL icon Kate McKinnon slams Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill: ‘I am deeply gay’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kate McKinnon discusses how she feels about Florida lawmakers passing the "Don't Say Gay" bill during SNL's Weekend Update.
(YouTube/Saturday Night Live)Kate McKinnon has viciously ripped apart Florida’s reviled “Don’t Say Gay” bill in a searing skit on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
But she quickly recovered and began to mock the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by purposefully saying mentioning the LGBT+ community as much as she could.
“I am deeply gay — sorry, concerned, deeply concerned,” McKinnon said.
“So kids, listen up, if you can’t say it you might as well sing it.”McKinnon then encouraged the audience to sing “gay, gay, gay” to the tune of Deep Purple’s “Smoke on the Water”, which was just everything.

     'SNL': Kate McKinnon Takes on Florida's "Don't Say Gay" Bill During Weekend Update
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This weekend's Saturday Night Live episode featured the evergreen Weekend Update segment, hosted by Colin Jost and Michael Che.
Another one of these contentious subjects was the Parental Rights in Education bill, most commonly known (especially by dissidents) as the 'Don't Say Gay' bill.
To discuss it, SNL regular Kate McKinnon joined Jost and, of course, injected ironic humor into the situation.
McKinnon was welcomed to the Update desk while being showered by the warm cheers and applause of the live audience.
However, the 'Don't Say Gay' bill is not devised to prevent the word from being used as an insult in schools.

     Kate McKinnon Goes Bonkers Over Ron DeSantis' 'Don't Say Gay' Bill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Saturday Night Live” star Kate McKinnon pretended this weekend that the hugely controversial “Don’t Say Gay” bill passed by Florida’s House of Representatives might actually be a good thing.
“I heard about this law, and I think it’s amazing,” McKinnon, who is herself gay, told “Weekend Update” co-anchor Colin Jost.
“Like, you know, ‘That’s so gay,’ or ‘Ew, you’re gay.’ It made me feel horrible.”Now, McKinnon said, she’s “so jazzed” to hear that Florida Gov.
Then it was time to say “gay” ― a lot.
“I am deeply gay,” McKinnon said.

     SNL all-star Kate McKinnon joined Colin Jost on Weekend Update to discuss Florida’s hateful and cruel “Don’t Say Gay” bill that just passed in the state’s House of Representatives.
She continued, “If the ’90s were right, and ‘gay’ means ‘bad,’ then this is the gayest law I have ever seen,” before encouraging the audience to sing “gay” instead, as she begins singing “gay, gay, gay” to the beat of Deep Purple’s “Smoke on the Water.”Fans and celebrities quickly took to social media to celebrate McKinnon’s rant and to condemn the bill, including last month’s host Ariana DeBose:“If you can’t say it you might as well sing it.”- Kate McKinnonCue me: Belting from the rafters 🗣🏳️‍🌈 GAY GAY GAY, GAY, GAY GAY GAY.

     Known as the Parental Rights in Education bill but coined the "Don't Say Gay" bill by critics, the controversial legislation would allow parents greater authority to take legal action against school districts that violate the bill.
McKinnon called the bill "unconscionable," but only after Weekend Update co-anchor Colin Jost cleared up some misconceptions.
