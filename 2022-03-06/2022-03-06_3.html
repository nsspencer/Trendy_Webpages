     Biggest Takeaways from AEW Revolution 2022 Results
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     2 of 7Credit: All Elite WrestlingAmong some great competitors, Wardlow was able to grab the brass ring and win the Face of the Revolution ladder match.
This proves MJF wrong, as he had said Wardlow wasn't going to win.
Assuming he can retain the TNT Championship over Scorpio Sky, Sammy Guevara is going to have his work cut out for him.
Wardlow has been on a tear and has the size advantage and momentum on his side.
If that's not the case and the belt is going to stay on Guevara, it will likely be due to MJF interfering and costing Wardlow the win out of spite.

     Summary: "This weekend we lost the fight for my daughter’s life against depression,” he wrote.
“She is no longer struggling anymore with the universe wanting their angel back."
He also referred to Winona as his "best friend" and a "hero."
No official cause of death has been released yet, and it's unclear whether one will ever be released to the public.
Winona was well known, but she was anonymous enough that her parents may be able to maintain their privacy as they grieve.

     CM Punk defeated MJF in a graphic dog collar match, pinning him after Wardlow passed Punk the Dynamite Diamond Ring.
Punk wrapped the chain around MJF's hand and crushed the hand with a bunch of knee strikes.
MJF was slumped against the ring steps, and Punk went for another knee strike with the chain wrapped around his leg.
MJF tried a tombstone on the apron, but Punk countered into a tombstone of his own.
There was a great spot where Punk tried to suplex MJF into the tacks, but couldn't because his knee failed.

Death Triangle - Grade: B+Chris Jericho vs. Eddie Kingston: Kingston landed a half-and-half suplex seconds after the bell rang, dropping Jericho on the top of his head.
Kingston vs. Jericho was the best kind of wrestling, if not quite perfect.
Cole hit a series of superkicks only for Page to nearly hit the Buckshot again.
A second Buckshot Lariat was enough to finish off Cole after Page hit a few superkicks of his own.
