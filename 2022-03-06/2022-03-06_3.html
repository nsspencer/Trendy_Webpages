     Jayson Tatum dropped a season-high 54 points, shooting 16-of-30 from the field to lead the Boston Celtics to a 126-120 win over the Brooklyn Nets.
Tatum tied Hall of Famer and Boston legend Larry Bird for the most 50-point games in Celtics history with four.
Tatum, 24, notched his fourth 50-point game in eight fewer years than Bird, who accomplished the feat when he was 32 years old.
Kevin Durant led the way for the Nets with 37 points, eight assists and six rebounds in 39 minutes of action in his second game back from a left knee injury.
Boston (39-27) maintains the fifth spot in the Eastern Conference, as Brooklyn (32-33) finds itself tied for eighth with the Charlotte Hornets.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kevin Durant was stellar for the Nets in his second game back since returning from injury, but on Saturday afternoon in Boston, no Brooklyn player could match Jayson Tatum as the 24-year-old dropped a season-high 54 points.
The Celtics weathered a great run from the Nets in the third quarter, and Tatum single-handedly kept Boston in in the game, scoring six points in the final 40 seconds of the period to close a seven-point Nets lead to just one.
Tatum continued his takeover, scoring 18 points in the fourth to surpass his previous season-high of 51.
In the fourth quarter, Durant surpassed 25,000 career points, becoming just the 23rd player in NBA history to hit that mark.
Durant finished the game with 37 points, with eight assists and six rebounds.

     After defeating the Brooklyn Nets with ease in their last two meetings, the Boston Celtics finally faced a (nearly) complete Nets squad.
Jayson Tatum hoisting the Boston Celtics on his shouldersTatum’s output on Sunday was the fourth-time in his career that he scored 50 or more points in a regular season game.
This ties him with Boston Celtics legend Larry Bird in becoming the only players in franchise history to achieve this feat four times.

     Another Jayson Tatum masterpiece (54 points) lifts Celtics to statement win over Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But Celtics forward Jayson Tatum was fine with that.
Last month, the Celtics twice feasted on an overmatched Nets team that was missing almost all of its top players.
The All-Star forward erupted for 54 points and guided the Celtics to a 126-120 win.
“When we kind of match that energy on offense, we’ll really be special.”Jayson Tatum scores two of his 54 points Sunday against the Nets.
And defensively we knew what we were going to be: a mentally tough team that can play through runs.

     What Stood Out in Celtics' Win vs. Nets: Jayson Tatum's 54 Points Help Boston Pass Its Latest Test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Led by a 54-point masterpiece from Jayson Tatum, the Celtics earned a 126-120 win over the Nets on Sunday.
The three-time All-Star and burgeoning superstar hung 54 points on the Nets to lead Boston to victory.
It wasn't just about Tatum scoring over 50 points, but it was the way he did it, seemingly never taking a bad shot; nothing felt forced.
After the game, Brown said he thought he could give it a go today, and his ankle "felt pretty good."
After the game, Tatum said, "Rob is probably the most important guy for the ceiling that we’re trying to get to."
