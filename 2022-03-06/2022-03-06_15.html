     Moldova seeks US support over Ukraine war refugees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some 120,000 people have crossed into the small country since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last week.
Moldova’s Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita has called on the United States to increase its humanitarian assistance to the country, as the number of refugees arriving from war-struck Ukraine reached 120,000.
For a small country like Moldova, proportionately, this is a very large number,” Gavrilita told Blinken.
“Everybody has come together to host, to provide shelter, to provide food, to provide assistance to those who are fleeing war,” she said.
Blinken, who is on the third stop of a Europe trip to shore up unity against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said Moldova “can count on us across the board” for support.

     Blinken Pledges US Support to Moldova Amid Refugee Influx from Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has pledged Washington's support to Moldova, a small, Western-leaning former Soviet republic that is contending with an influx of refugees from neighboring Ukraine.
Moldova says that more than 230,000 refugees have crossed its border with Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on February 24.
Moldova is appealing for international assistance in dealing with the refugees, while also seeking security reassurances against potential Russian aggression.
The move was likely to anger Russia, which has an estimated 1,500 troops based in the breakaway region of Transdniester in Moldova’s east.
Moldova depends heavily on Russian gas.

     U.S. top diplomat Blinken reassures Moldova amid refugee influx from Ukraine

     Summary: Olivier Douliery/Pool via REUTERSCHISINAU, Moldova, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday reassured Moldova’s leaders that the United States would rally international opposition to Russian aggression "whenever and wherever" it occurs.
The United States is not committed to defend Moldova since the former Soviet Republic, like its neighbor Ukraine, is not a member of NATO.
The Russian presence, which dates back to Moldova's independence in the early 1990s, is illegal, she said.
Blinken said the United States was providing $18 million over the next few years to "strengthen and diversify" Moldova's energy sector.
"(Energy) independence and energy security is actually critical to maintaining one's sovereignty and independence," Blinken said.

     Moldova approaches ‘breaking point’ over Ukraine war next door

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moldova is approaching ‘breaking point’ as multiple crises resulting from Russia’s war on Ukraine cause serious domestic repercussions, Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu told reporters on Saturday (5 March).
With a population of roughly 2.6 million, Moldova has taken in 237,000 refugees, of whom 113,000 remain on its territory.
“We are by far the most fragile neighbour of Ukraine,” Popescu said, adding that if one compares the number of refugees to the population “, it gets pretty dramatic”.
Alongside Ukraine and Georgia, its partners from the so-called Associated Trio, Moldova, applied to join the EU earlier this week.
Some analysts believe that territory could be used as a future staging point in the Russian military’s invasion of Ukraine.

     ‘The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey’ review: Samuel L. Jackson stars in a tale of secrets and buried treasure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For a conspicuously busy superstar such as Samuel L. Jackson, the six-part Apple TV+ adaptation of Walter Mosley’s “The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey” demanded his largest, deepest commitment to a role in a long time.
Jackson serves as executive producer and star of “Ptolemy Grey,” which is based on the 2010 novel from the author made famous by the Easy Rawlins mysteries.
A lot of what’s best about “Ptolemy Grey” is pretty simple and consistently rewarding: the interplay between Jackson and Dominique Fishback, who plays the teenage caregiver of the title character.
Much of Grey’s long life doesn’t make the cut here in limited series form.
At its best “Ptolemy Grey” lets the audience know it’s listening to a writer with a singular ear for vernacular, and dramatic poetry.

The government has put in place the most comprehensive humanitarian operation in the history of the Republic of Moldova.
But we will need assistance to deal with this influx, and we need this quickly and through flexible instruments.
You’re showing us and you’re showing the world how democracies can grow, strengthen, and we are and will be your partner in that.

     The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey Review: A Strong Hook That Fails to Dig Deep Enough
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As adapted by Walter Mosley from his own novel, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey opens with a fascinating hook.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey primarily centers Ptolemy’s attempts to set his affairs in order while growing fond of his new caretaker, a 17-year-old girl named Robyn (Dominique Fishback).
Yet, while the man can recall his entire life without a hitch, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey remains curiously limited in what it chooses to depict.
But in focusing so little on those aspects of Ptolemy’s life, it offers up a character that feels as incomplete as the actions he undertakes.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey starts strong but, by failing to probe further into its protagonist’s life, its main character only grows thinner as the story progresses.

(AP Photo/Sergei Grits) (Sergei Grits)CHISINAU, Moldova — (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday pledged America’s support to the small, Western-leaning former Soviet republic of Moldova that is coping with an influx of refugees from Ukraine and warily watching Russia’s intensifying war with its neighbor.
More than 230,000 people have fled into or passed through Moldova from Ukraine since the war began 11 days ago.
“Moldova is a powerful example of a democracy rising to the moment with vision and with determination," Blinken said.
