     Scottie Scheffler Plays It Straight to Win Arnold Palmer Invitational
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO, Fla. — Throughout the final round Sunday at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, it was as if someone were playing a prank on the world’s best golfers.
Simple tasks, like needing fewer than three attempts to sink a putt from one yard away, were suddenly impossible.
Greenside chips were no less wayward, usually long or short but rarely in between.
The players, one after another, were left scratching their heads, stomping their feet in anger or smiling sardonically.
One tour veteran, Matt Jones, simply flung his putter into a pond after one such vexing experience.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On the greens, Scheffler ranked fourth in putts per green in regulation, but it was a couple of par-savers that were most important.
Scheffler used his Scotty Cameron prototype putter to hole a 21-footer for par at the 15th after a low punch shot failed to get out of the rough.
On the 16th hole, he made a six-footer after having to lay up with his third shot on the par 5.
Scheffler then finished things off with a steely two-putt from 69 feet on the final hole that ga e him the win when Viktor Hovland and then Billy Horschel failed to birdie the 18th.

NBCScottie Scheffler was on live TV and about to talk about how tough a test Bay Hill was over the past four days.
But first, he had to take a quick break and embrace his wife, Meredith, who blitzed onto the scene to celebrate her husband’s second win in his last three starts.
“Meredith obviously knows me better than anybody, being my wife,” Scheffler said later in his press conference.

     Scottie Scheffler successfully emerged from a golf tournament so attritional it was worthy of an X-rating.
“I’m glad I’m off that golf course, I’m glad I’m done,” said Gary Woodland, who shared fifth.
You just don’t get rewarded for good shots.
I’m hitting good shots.
“I don’t mind golf courses being penal when you miss, but it’s not rewarding good shots.

     Scottie Scheffler earns his second PGA Tour win in the past month with a victory at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill.
(1:13)ORLANDO, Fla. -- Scottie Scheffler isn't sure he won the Arnold Palmer Invitational as much as he survived it.
The real heartbreak went to Woodland, trying to win for the first time since the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.
He three-putted the 14th for the first of two straight birdies and closed with three pars for a 72.
The consolation prize for Kirk was earning one of three spots available for The Open at St. Andrews this summer.

     The win moves Scheffler, who got his first career PGA Tour win last month at the Phoenix Open, to No.
“I’m glad I’m off that golf course,” Woodland said.
“There’s a lot of guys that sort of stay away this week to get ready for next week (The Players Championship).
It’s just a golf course set-up issue and maybe just trying to make it a little less penal when you miss, I guess.
The golf course is hard enough, and then you throw out the firm greens and the wind and not much grass, ball is oscillating a little bit.”
