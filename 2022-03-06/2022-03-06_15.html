     Scottie Scheffler Plays It Straight to Win Arnold Palmer Invitational
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ORLANDO, Fla. — Throughout the final round Sunday at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, it was as if someone were playing a prank on the world’s best golfers.
Simple tasks, like needing fewer than three attempts to sink a putt from one yard away, were suddenly impossible.
Greenside chips were no less wayward, usually long or short but rarely in between.
The players, one after another, were left scratching their heads, stomping their feet in anger or smiling sardonically.
One tour veteran, Matt Jones, simply flung his putter into a pond after one such vexing experience.

He needed to be tough this weekend as a U.S. Open broke out a few months early at Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club and Lodge.
Only four of 77 players managed to break par in the final round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational while six signed for 80 or higher.
The field combined to shoot 266-over par on Sunday for the highest scoring average in a round (75.5) at this event since 1981.
It also marked the first single-digit under-par winner on the Tour since Jon Rahm at the 2021 U.S. Open in June.
