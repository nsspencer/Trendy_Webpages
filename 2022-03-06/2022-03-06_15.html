     'Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty' review: HBO's nostalgic miniseries doesn't conjure much magic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) The equivalent of missing what should be an easy layup, "Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty" stumbles on the road to greatness, undermining can't-miss subject matter for basketball fans with an uneven, at times farcical tone.
Although '80s-style excess clearly accounts for much of the sizzle, this exercise feels like a no-look pass that skips out of bounds.
Produced by "Don't Look Up's" Adam McKay (who also directed the first episode), and based on Jeff Pearlman's book about the period, the 10-episode series focuses on the first season in which new owner Jerry Buss (John C. Reilly) drafted rookie phenom Earvin "Magic" Johnson (standout newcomer Quincy Isaiah), winning the first of five NBA titles in a decade.
In addition to their passion for basketball, the late Buss and Johnson (who has notably disavowed the project ) shared a playboy lifestyle, while transforming the Forum, where the Lakers played their games, into the hottest ticket in town.
Still, "Winning Time" feels too cute for its own good, especially in the early going, when characters keep breaking the fourth wall to chat directly with the audience, and everyone but Buss and Magic appears to be kind of jerk.

     HBO's "Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty” knows how to put on a show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     By the time we get to coach Jack McKinney's part in "Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty," we already understand the type of once-in-an-era lineup the Los Angeles Lakers had in the early 1980s.
Pat Riley, the former player turned coach who came out of nowhere to lead the Lakers to four NBA Championships.
But they do follow McKinney's description of flow, embracing the situational disarray of the Lakers' Showtime era with giddy nonchalance.
Adrien Brody as Pat Riley in "Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty" (Warrick Page/HBO)"Winning Time," based on Jeff Pearlman's book "Showtime: Magic, Kareem, Riley, and the Los Angeles Lakers Dynasty of the 1980s," is a miracle of showmanship that knows precisely how to capitalize on the magnetism of its principal players.
"Winning Time" premieres Sunday, March 6 at 9 p.m. on HBO and streams on HBO Max, with new episodes debuting weekly.

     HBO’s Lakers Show Has an Adam McKay Problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Winning Time starts off promisingly, with a cold open set in 1991 as Lakers star Magic Johnson receives his HIV diagnosis.
Winning Time’s first episode was directed by Adam McKay, who also serves as an executive producer on the series.
For a series about one of the most famous basketball teams in history, Winning Time shows remarkably little actual basketball.
(Ferrell had wanted to play Buss, and was hurt when McKay went instead for Reilly, who’s Ferrell’s best friend.)
Winning Time evokes an iconic moment in Lakers history, just not the one it wants to.

     I’m going to leave it at that,” Johnson told TMZ in December 2021.)
Ultimately, Winning Time is a love letter to Jerry Buss, one of the greatest innovators that any sport has ever seen—as well as one of the most eccentric.
In Winning Time, Lakers head coach Jerry West (Jason Clarke) is convinced that the team shouldn’t draft Magic with its No.
Did a mob hit and a bicycle accident lead to Pat Riley becoming the Lakers coach?
They’re more like, you know, ‘Spike his drink’ or ‘Spike his car’ or something,” Haywood told Deadspin in 2014.

     ‘Winning Time’ Recap: When Magic Met Jerry
    </h2>

     Magic had just been diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, which at the time was a death sentence.
In some ways, Jerry and Magic are two very different men.
The Jerry scenes are a delight, and “The Swan” smartly contrasts him with the old-money arrogance of Cooke (played by Michael O’Keefe).
Lakers coach Jerry West thinks Magic is too tall to play point guard, even though the kid just helped win a college national championship at that position.
Warrick Page/HBOIt is not a spoiler to say this will be far from the last time either Jerry or Magic will get to party on and around this court.

     "The Lakers really changed the game, the global game that we celebrate today," Solomon Hughes, who plays Lakers icon Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the series, told ET.
But if you just look at the basic facts of Dr. Jerry Buss' life, it's an incredible ride...
"He's not big on compliments, but I know he's happy...
He was very, very proud and I think I did him justice and I think he's going to be excited to see it."
Following Jerry Buss' death in 2013, Jeanie became controlling owner and president of the Lakers, per her father's wishes.
