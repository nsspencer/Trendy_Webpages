    </h2>

     Two and a half minutes into the second half, Johnny Davis went down.
In his final game in the Kohl Center, Brad Davison put the team on his back when they needed it most, leading the Badger surge in the second half.
The Badgers went ice cold from the field with just under six minutes to play.
Over that period, Nebraska went on a 10-0 run to take a 72-71 lead with 1:50 remaining.
With a chance to tie the game at the line, Hepburn missed the first before making the next two to cut the Nebraska lead to one.

     'These guys deserve it': Unflappable Huskers stun No. 10 Wisconsin to end the regular season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There are many ways to try and wrap your head around the Nebraska men's basketball team some how, some way, winning a third straight road game to end the regular season.
And with the way Nebraska is playing now, perhaps that season that looked so lost now has a little bit of meaning.
Also in the madness was a technical foul on Alonzo Verge, his fourth foul of the game.
After the ninth foul on NU, with 15:43 still to play, the Huskers weren't whistled for another until 19 seconds remained.
He leads NU in scoring at 17.2 points per game, is second on the team in rebounding, and tied for second in assists.
