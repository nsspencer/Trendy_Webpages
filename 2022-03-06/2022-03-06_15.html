     Summary: Some 120,000 people have crossed into the small country since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last week.
Moldova’s Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita has called on the United States to increase its humanitarian assistance to the country, as the number of refugees arriving from war-struck Ukraine reached 120,000.
For a small country like Moldova, proportionately, this is a very large number,” Gavrilita told Blinken.
“Everybody has come together to host, to provide shelter, to provide food, to provide assistance to those who are fleeing war,” she said.
Blinken, who is on the third stop of a Europe trip to shore up unity against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said Moldova “can count on us across the board” for support.

     Blinken Pledges US Support to Moldova Amid Refugee Influx from Ukraine
>>>>>>> 2164a7d126f37bf0639256469735819c3974b110
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has pledged Washington's support to Moldova, a small, Western-leaning former Soviet republic that is contending with an influx of refugees from neighboring Ukraine.
Moldova says that more than 230,000 refugees have crossed its border with Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on February 24.
Moldova is appealing for international assistance in dealing with the refugees, while also seeking security reassurances against potential Russian aggression.
The move was likely to anger Russia, which has an estimated 1,500 troops based in the breakaway region of Transdniester in Moldova’s east.
Moldova depends heavily on Russian gas.

The United States is not committed to defend Moldova since the former Soviet Republic, like its neighbor Ukraine, is not a member of NATO.

     Summary: Moldova is approaching ‘breaking point’ as multiple crises resulting from Russia’s war on Ukraine cause serious domestic repercussions, Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu told reporters on Saturday (5 March).
With a population of roughly 2.6 million, Moldova has taken in 237,000 refugees, of whom 113,000 remain on its territory.
“We are by far the most fragile neighbour of Ukraine,” Popescu said, adding that if one compares the number of refugees to the population “, it gets pretty dramatic”.
Alongside Ukraine and Georgia, its partners from the so-called Associated Trio, Moldova, applied to join the EU earlier this week.
Some analysts believe that territory could be used as a future staging point in the Russian military’s invasion of Ukraine.
