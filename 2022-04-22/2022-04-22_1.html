In the series now, the boys from the bayou have outscored Phoenix 134-110 in the second half.
This Pelicans team has shown fight all season long.
They will not turn away, and their performance in the second half illustrates their ability to make adjustments at the half that Monty needs to counter.

     Suns vs. Pelicans score: Chris Paul, Deandre Ayton lead Phoenix to crucial win over New Orleans in Game 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns entered Game 3 of their best-of-seven series against the New Orleans Pelicans shorthanded following the injury to Devin Booker but that did not stop them from stealing back homecourt advantage on Friday night at the Smoothie King Center in a 114-111 win.
Behind standout performances from Chris Paul and Deandre Ayton, the duo combined for 56 points, 21 rebounds and 15 assists in the win, Phoenix was able to pick up the road win they were searching for in Game 3.
Despite the loss, the Pelicans have shown that they are more than up to the challenge of pushing the top-seeded Suns to the limit.
Given the fact Booker will not take the floor again in this series for Phoenix, it will be interesting to see whether or not New Orleans can bounce back in Game 4.
