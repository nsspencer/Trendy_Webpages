     Heat’s depth forces tough decisions, but Spoelstra views it as ‘the strength of our team’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The playoff rotation is a result of what has worked in the regular season.
“I’m not thinking about that now.”The Heat’s rotation to begin the playoffs seems clear, with Kyle Lowry, Max Strus, Jimmy Butler, P.J.
But that still leaves proven veterans such as Victor Oladipo and Markieff Morris out of the Heat’s consistent rotation.
Instead it was Butler who led the Heat’s offense with 45 points, a playoff career-high, in Game 2.
Every playoff team featured at least one player who averaged more points in the regular season than the Heat’s leading scorer, Butler (21.4 points per game).
