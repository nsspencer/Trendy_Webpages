     Marjorie Taylor Greene Denies ‘Insurrectionist’ Charge in Court

     Summary: He maintained that the entire Free Speech for People effort was designed to deny Georgia voters their rights, because the plaintiffs could not defeat Ms. Greene at the ballot box.
It’s a court of law,” Mr. Bopp said.
A separate effort is pending against Republicans, including Senator Ron Johnson, in Wisconsin.
But so far, only the case against Ms. Greene has been allowed to proceed.
And on Friday, she was forced to answer questions under oath.

     Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene deflects in court hearing testimony about Jan. 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., on Friday repeatedly deflected questions about her involvement in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, and efforts by former President Donald Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
Greene testified under oath for nearly four hours as a witness during the hearing, as challengers make their case against her eligibility to run for re-election.
Greene was asked numerous questions about if she had any connection to the events that occurred on Jan. 6, 2021, and in the days leading up to the riot.
Asked when she first became aware that there would be a large demonstration on that day, Greene said, "I don't recall."
Greene's attorney, James Bopp, dismissed the day's events as a "political show trial."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Greene says the challenge to her candidacy is a lie and a scam designed to take away her constituents' rights to vote for the candidate of their choice.
Similar challenges elsewhereA similar challenge to Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn's candidacy was tossed out by a judge in North Carolina.
Greene asked a federal court to dismiss her challenge, but the judge let the case proceed.
Page Pate, a trial attorney in Georgia, said that disqualifying Greene from the ballot might not be the challengers' only goal.
Nancy Hollandchad, a longtime volunteer with Paulding County Republican Women, says efforts to take on Greene only embolden her supporters.

     Summary: Asked about the Proud Boys' plans for a Jan. 6, "1776 Returns," Greene denied any knowledge of it.
Greene was also asked whether she recalled urging President Trump to impose martial law as a way to remain in power.
Celli also asked if she knew of certain groups planning demonstrations on Jan. 6, 2021, Greene responded, "I don't recall."
He referred to video interviews, especially the one in which Greene said Trump supporters could not "allow power to transfer peacefully like Joe Biden wants."
Then, he will make a recommendation to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger about Greene's candidacy, and it will be up to him to decide whether to remove her from the ballot.

     Marjorie Taylor Greene appears in court over attempt to bar her from Congress
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared in court in Georgia on Friday for a hearing in an attempt to bar her from Congress for aiding the insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.
“The most powerful witness against Marjorie Taylor Greene’s candidacy … the most powerful witness in establishing that she crossed the line into engagement in insurrection is Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” Fein said.
Celli asked the court “to acknowledge that this is an adverse witness” and said: “Ms Greene, I’m just asking questions.”“I’m just answering,” Greene said.
Whenever Celli suggested Greene endorsed violence to stop certification of electoral votes, Greene said she did not support violence and encouraged peaceful protest.
Asked if she was aware some Trump supporters saw that as a call to violence, Greene said she was talking about plans to object to electoral votes.
