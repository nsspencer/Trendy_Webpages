     Summary: The Phoenix Suns announced on Thursday that All-Star shooting guard Devin Booker is now expected to miss the remainder of their first-round series against the New Orleans Pelicans.
Another update has been provided on Booker’s progress and at the moment, things aren’t looking very good for the 25-year-old.
According to Allie LaForce of NBA on TNT, the Suns also confirmed that Booker has been a non-participant in practice (NBA TV on Twitter):“The team travelled on Wednesday so he didn’t do anything,” LaForce said.
"@ALaForce provides an update on Devin Booker's hamstring injury before Game 3 of Suns-Pelicans.
pic.twitter.com/SeKelA1bul — NBA TV (@NBATV) April 22, 2022This isn’t at all surprising considering how the Suns have already ruled Booker out for at least another week.

     NBA playoffs: Suns, Bucks both in trouble with injured stars, but which title contender's in greater danger?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One night later, Khris Middleton hurt his knee as the Bucks lost their second game against the Bulls.
Let's take a closer look at what the Suns and Bucks are dealing with to figure that out.
The Suns and Bucks are built very differently offensively.
What the Bulls do have over the Pelicans, or more appropriately, the Bucks, are a few distinct matchup advantages.
In this subjective argument, though, it's worth pointing out that the Bucks have an MVP and the Suns don't.
