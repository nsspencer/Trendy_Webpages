     More than 20 states suing Biden administration to keep Title 42 in place
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (Nexstar) — The White House said it’s ramping up security at the southern border in preparation for May 23 — the day the sweeping pandemic border restrictions known as Title 42 are set to expire.
More than 20 states with Republican Attorneys General are suing to require the Biden administration to keep Title 42 in effect.
The Department of Homeland Security estimates when Title 42 lifts, 18,000 additional migrants will cross the U.S.-Mexico border each day.
Republicans are calling on the administration to keep the Title 42 health authority in place until Border Patrol is properly equipped to handle the expected surge of migrants.
But the White House said extending Title 42 is up to Congress, so if lawmakers want to extend it, they need to act.

     End of Title 42 could make it harder to cross southern border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden administration is preparing a return to pre-pandemic border enforcement, a change officials and immigration advocates say will make the border harder to cross, not easier.
The administration hasn’t changed its plan for responding to a potential uptick in migration following the lifting of Title 42 – but it has changed its messaging.
“We have immigration laws that existed before Title 42,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council.
“Let me reiterate again – Title 42 is not an immigration authority.
A return to Title 8, as regular border processing is known, would automatically fix at least two of the top flaws in the Title 42 policy: it triggered repeat border crossings by individuals, and it crippled the U.S. asylum system.

     Biden White House stands behind Title 42 decision amid party revolt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The White House is “definitely not going to reverse their decision on Title 42,” said Kerri Talbot, deputy director of the advocacy group Immigration Hub.
The White House has suggested to lawmakers that they pass legislation to change the CDC’s authority on the public health order themselves if they were inclined to.
The former administration official said the White House has long been planning for future increases in migration.
But Escobar maintained that Title 42 has not been an effective deterrent.
Some 1.7 million migrants have been expelled under Title 42 since it was first implemented, including asylum seekers.

     Public health law must never again be misused to expel asylum seekers: Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The public health justification for Title 42 was spurious at its inception and at odds with the science on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection.
Since the earliest days of the pandemic, public health experts have noted that tried and tested public health measures such as masking, social distancing, improved ventilation and testing can be layered together to allow the safe processing of asylum seekers at US borders3,4.
Indeed, the Title 42 order remained in effect even as masking and vaccination mandates eased around the United States as the Omicron BA.1 wave subsided.
At a time when public health and science have been under assault from the spread of misinformation and disinformation, the CDC, through its own misuse of public health to block the lifesaving right to asylum, further eroded the legitimacy so central to trust in our public health institutions.
And it is equally imperative to ensure that public health is never again weaponized against those seeking protection at the US border.

     The Memo: Biden faces mutiny on Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The deadline for the lifting of Title 42 is a month away — but the Biden administration is under enormous pressure to stall the timeline amid a Democratic mutiny.
Title 42 will be top of the agenda when the Senate returns next week.
But there is also virtually no-one, on any side of the debate, who sees Title 42 as truly rooted in public health concerns.
On Thursday, more than 20 states asked a federal judge to immediately bar the Biden administration from lifting Title 42.
Those are the kinds of modest missteps that Biden can’t afford as the knot around Title 42 grows harder to unpick.

     Summary: “The use of Title 42 is an attempt to tread water in the middle of a hurricane, rather than going to shelter,” Reichlin-Melnick said Wednesday.
“We have seen how Title 42 has made the border more chaotic.
The administration defended the use of Title 42 as a health measure, despite the waning pandemic.
“In some ways, Title 42 was a bit of a distraction,” he said.
President Obama put in place family detention, President Trump put in place family separation, remain in Mexico and then Title 42 and President Biden has kept Title 42 in place.”
