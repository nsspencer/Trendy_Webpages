     What does Title 42 ending mean for those working along the border?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Border Patrol agents and advocacy groups helping migrant families are preparing for what the potential change in policy could mean for national security.
“Title 42 is meant to be a temporary response to the COVID pandemic,” said Sara Ramey, an immigration attorney at the Migrant Center for Human Rights in San Antonio.
Former President Donald Trump enacted Title 42 in 2020.
They were released from Border Patrol custody and left to wait with nowhere to go.
“Border Patrol agents in Del Rio sector and across the country are completely overwhelmed.

     More than 20 states suing Biden administration to keep Title 42 in place
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (Nexstar) — The White House said it’s ramping up security at the southern border in preparation for May 23 — the day the sweeping pandemic border restrictions known as Title 42 are set to expire.
More than 20 states with Republican Attorneys General are suing to require the Biden administration to keep Title 42 in effect.
The Department of Homeland Security estimates when Title 42 lifts, 18,000 additional migrants will cross the U.S.-Mexico border each day.
Republicans are calling on the administration to keep the Title 42 health authority in place until Border Patrol is properly equipped to handle the expected surge of migrants.
But the White House said extending Title 42 is up to Congress, so if lawmakers want to extend it, they need to act.

     Dem. Rep. Cuellar: Biden hurting party pre-midterm by lifting Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas border Democrat, says President Biden is hurting their party by ending the Trump-era health policy known as Title 42 that allows for the instant deportation of illegal immigrants due to the pandemic.
You know, in talking with some of my Republican colleagues, they’re saying ‘We can’t believe the White House is giving us this narrative.
We can’t believe that they’re hurting Democrat candidates for the November election,’” the congressman told Fox News Digital on Thursday.
And if you look at the independent voters, they’re not happy about this decision.
Mark Kelly of Arizona, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Chris Coons of Delaware and Gary Peters of Michigan have come out asking the administration to reconsider rescinding Title 42.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The White House is “definitely not going to reverse their decision on Title 42,” said Kerri Talbot, deputy director of the advocacy group Immigration Hub.
The White House has suggested to lawmakers that they pass legislation to change the CDC’s authority on the public health order themselves if they were inclined to.
The former administration official said the White House has long been planning for future increases in migration.
But Escobar maintained that Title 42 has not been an effective deterrent.
Some 1.7 million migrants have been expelled under Title 42 since it was first implemented, including asylum seekers.

     Public health law must never again be misused to expel asylum seekers: Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The public health justification for Title 42 was spurious at its inception and at odds with the science on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection.
Since the earliest days of the pandemic, public health experts have noted that tried and tested public health measures such as masking, social distancing, improved ventilation and testing can be layered together to allow the safe processing of asylum seekers at US borders3,4.
Indeed, the Title 42 order remained in effect even as masking and vaccination mandates eased around the United States as the Omicron BA.1 wave subsided.
At a time when public health and science have been under assault from the spread of misinformation and disinformation, the CDC, through its own misuse of public health to block the lifesaving right to asylum, further eroded the legitimacy so central to trust in our public health institutions.
And it is equally imperative to ensure that public health is never again weaponized against those seeking protection at the US border.

     End of Title 42 could make it harder to cross southern border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden administration is preparing a return to pre-pandemic border enforcement, a change officials and immigration advocates say will make the border harder to cross, not easier.
The administration hasn’t changed its plan for responding to a potential uptick in migration following the lifting of Title 42 – but it has changed its messaging.
“We have immigration laws that existed before Title 42,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council.
“Let me reiterate again – Title 42 is not an immigration authority.
A return to Title 8, as regular border processing is known, would automatically fix at least two of the top flaws in the Title 42 policy: it triggered repeat border crossings by individuals, and it crippled the U.S. asylum system.

     Wisconsin congressman leads group of Republicans to push for Title 42 extension at US-Mexico Border

     Summary: WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - U.S. Customs and Border Protection anticipates an increase in border encounters following the end of the CDC’s Title 42 Public Health Order next month, but a group of Republicans is asking President Joe Biden to keep the order in place.
Earlier this month, Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) visited the Southwest border sectors in San Diego, California and Yuma, Arizona.
“The first night we were there we hung around the border for maybe 45 minutes.
The order was put in place in March 2020 by former President Donald Trump in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I think Title 42 should stay simply because we still have a pandemic here in the U.S.,” said Cuellar.
