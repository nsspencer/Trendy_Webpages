     Republican Kevin McCarthy under fire after audio shows he discussed urging Trump to resign
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) speaks to the media on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 2, 2019.
U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of the few Republican politicians openly critical of Trump, blasted McCarthy on Twitter on Thursday night.
"Question for Kevin McCarthy ... how can you honestly feel ok with the lies?
"While I was rallying in Wyoming against Liz Cheney ... Kevin McCarthy was defending Liz Cheney among House Republicans ... you should have trusted my instincts, not your own," Gaetz said in a tweet.
McCarthy's fate will depend largely on Trump, who remains the most powerful figure in the Republican Party more than a year after he left office.

     Summary: Audio reveals Kevin McCarthy planned to urge Trump to resign after Capitol riotEnlarge this image toggle caption Samuel Corum/Getty Images Samuel Corum/Getty ImagesU.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had planned to get former President Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, The New York Times revealed in an audio recording Thursday.
"I think this will pass, and that would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.
In January, the committee asked McCarthy to appear and share more about his interest to have Trump resign.
Tensions had been high between McCarthy and Trump on Jan. 6McCarthy and Trump had a shouting match during a phone call during the Jan. 6 attack, where McCarthy pleaded with Trump to take notice that the rioters were Trump supporters.
Days later, McCarthy took to the House floor later to say Trump "bears responsibility" for his role in the attack.

     Trump accepted ‘some responsibility’ for Capitol attack, McCarthy audio reveals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New audio clips reveal that the House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy held Donald Trump responsible in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 Capitol riot, and that Trump himself accepted “some responsibility” for the insurrection.
Cheney asked McCarthy if he believed Trump would resign if Congress successfully passed a 25th amendment resolution, which would declare Trump incapable of holding office.
Although McConnell criticized Trump publicly for his role in the attack, he voted to acquit the former president in his impeachment trial.
He also said he would support Trump should Trump be the 2024 Republican nominee.
McCarthy, for his part, did a more complete about-face: he has claimed that Trump was unaware of the attack until McCarthy broke the news to him that it was happening.

     Liz Cheney denies recording bombshell tape of Kevin McCarthy saying he would urge Trump to resign after Jan. 6 riot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Liz Cheney on Friday denied recording or leaking audio from a phone call that appears to show House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying he would tell then-President Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
"The only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said, according to the recording.
In it, McCarthy tells top House Republicans that Trump admitted he bears some responsibility for the Capitol riot.
The vast majority of House Republicans — who would vote on whether to make McCarthy speaker — have stayed loyal to Trump.
"The only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.

     Summary: McCarthy responds that he's "had a few discussions," adding that he was planning to call Trump later that night but was doubtful that Trump would "ever walk away."
I think there’s a chance it’ll pass the Senate, even when he’s gone," McCarthy says, apparently referring to an impeachment resolution.
On Friday, CNN aired more audio obtained by the New York Times of a conference call that McCarthy held with House Republicans on Jan. 11, 2021.
McCarthy said he had spoken to Trump that day and Trump accepted some responsibility for the Jan. 6 attack.
Days later, McCarthy met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, seeking to repair their relationship.

     Kevin McCarthy’s speakership hopes face new threat from Trump comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There were early indications that Trump aides were downplaying the impact of the new revelations on Trump and McCarthy’s relationship.
The Washington Post first reported on the conversation between McCarthy and Trump.
A spokesperson for Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who heads House Republicans’ campaign arm, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump still commands great sway over House Republicans and his reaction to McCarthy’s newly public comments could ripple across the caucus, as well as among the candidates likely to help Republicans take control of the House next year.
Joining Bannon, Trump associate Boris Epshteyn described the audio as “extremely hurtful to hopes that Kevin McCarthy has to become speaker.”“Kevin McCarthy’s got a big problem,” Epshteyn said.
