     Biden administration asks federal judge to deny request to immediately block end of Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Biden administration told a federal judge in Louisiana on Friday that the court should deny a request from more than 20 states to immediately block the end of a Trump-era pandemic restriction on the US-Mexico border.
In a court filing, the Justice Department argued: "Plaintiffs fail to show that they face a significant, non-speculative threat of injury.
DHS continues to prioritize Title 42 expulsions to the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras."
Texas also filed a separate lawsuit Friday against the Biden administration to end Title 42.
The Justice Department pushed back on that claim, saying that while it was deferring to traditional immigration protocols in some cases, numbers remain small.

     Stefanik, Colleagues Urge Court to Uphold Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined 53 of her colleagues in filing an amicus brief in support of the Title 42 injunction lawsuit filed by the Louisiana, Arizona, and Missouri Attorneys General.
“Joe Biden’s decision to end Title 42 is one more of his failed policies that will only incentivize the surge of illegal immigrants and flow of deadly drugs across our southern border,” Stefanik said.
Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) could reach full capacity within a few days of Title 42 ending and be forced to release illegal immigrants into the U.S, increasing the amount of illegal immigrants released into U.S. communities across the country.
Fentanyl that entered through the southern border accounts for approximately two out of every three fentanyl-related deaths.
The Biden Administration does not have an actual plan in place to prevent the surge in illegal immigration.

     Texas sues Biden administration over plans to end Trump-era Title 42 immigration policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More:What is Title 42, when does it end, how does it impact US-Mexico border?
Texas is the latest state to sue the Biden administration over ending Title 42.
The decision to end the policy ultimately rests with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
CDC officials said in early April they were on track to terminate Title 42 authority by May 23, a decision made in consultation with the Homeland Security Department.
Under Title 42, border agents can pick up migrants who cross between ports of entry, process and expel them within hours — without allowing them an opportunity to make a case for staying in the country legally, including seeking asylum.

     Texas Sues To Block Biden From Ending Title 42 Border Restriction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Key BackgroundThe Texas suit comes a day after a group of more than 20 states with Republican attorneys general asked a federal judge in Louisiana to block the Biden administration from repealing Title 42.
Some Senate Republicans earlier this month said they would hold up Covid-19 funding requested by the administration unless Title 42 was extended.
Axios reported earlier this week that the Biden administration was considering delaying the repeal of the public health order—set to go into effect May 23—amid pushback from Democrats.
ContraA host of progressive Democrats are in favor of revoking Title 42 and had been pressing the Biden administration to do so in the months leading up to the decision.
