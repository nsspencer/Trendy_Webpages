     Summary: 15 years later, Portugal identifies a suspect in the probe of a missing British girlEnlarge this image toggle caption Armando Franca/AP Armando Franca/APLISBON, Portugal — Prosecutors in southern Portugal are formally accusing a suspect in the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, a British girl who disappeared nearly 15 years ago while on a family vacation in the southern European country.
In mid-2020, Germany's police identified Christian Brueckner, a German citizen, as a suspect in the case.
McCann was 3 years old at the time of her disappearance from an apartment where her family was vacationing in the Algarve seaside town of Praia da Luz.
Brueckner, 45, is serving a sentence on drug offenses in a German prison and has a pending seven-year sentence for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal.
Investigators in the nearby town of Portimao are leading the probe with the assistance of the Judiciary Police, the prosecutors' statement said.

     In Madeleine McCann's disappearance, child sex offender designated as official suspect
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A man has been declared an official suspect in Germany at Portugal's request in connection with the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann nearly 15 years ago, a Portuguese prosecutor's office announced Thursday.
Madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment in the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007, a few days before her fourth birthday, sparking a media frenzy and an unprecedented international manhunt.
The public prosecutor's office in the southern Algarve city of Portimao said the suspect, whose identity was not confirmed, was identified as an official suspect on Wednesday.
In Portugal, an "arguido" is an official suspect but is not someone who has been charged.
"The case was reopened after new elements came to light," a spokesman for the public prosecutor's office told AFP.

     Formal suspect named in Madeleine McCann case nearly 15 years after her disappearance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the first time since Madeleine McCann disappeared from a resort in Portugal in 2007, Portuguese authorities say they have a formal suspect in the case.
Madeleine was staying with her parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, and her younger twin siblings in a holiday apartment when she vanished almost 15 years ago.
At that time, in the summer of 2020, German authorities also reported that they believed, despite the fact that no body had been found, that McCann was dead.
Her parents spoke to NBC News on the ten-year anniversary of her disappearance about the hole it left in their lives.
"I mean, it's time that we should have had with madeleine," Kate McCann said.
