     Parents of Steelers QB Dwayne Haskins not attending son's funeral
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The parents of Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Dwayne Haskins say they will not attend his funeral services on Friday.
A 911 call later revealed that Haskins' wife called authorities from Pittsburgh to let them know that Haskins had run out of gas and was walking to get assistance.
Two memorials are planned in Haskins' honor – one Saturday in Rockaway Township, New Jersey, and a vigil planned for Sunday at Haskins' high school, Bullis School in Potomac, Maryland.
Kalabrya and Dwayne Haskins were married in March 2021.
In July, Kalabrya Haskins was arrested in Las Vegas and booked on a felony charge of battery and domestic violence after an argument led to Dwayne Haskins suffering a split upper lip and a missing tooth.
