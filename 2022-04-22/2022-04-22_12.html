     Summary: 15 years later, Portugal identifies a suspect in the probe of a missing British girlEnlarge this image toggle caption Armando Franca/AP Armando Franca/APLISBON, Portugal — Prosecutors in southern Portugal are formally accusing a suspect in the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, a British girl who disappeared nearly 15 years ago while on a family vacation in the southern European country.
In mid-2020, Germany's police identified Christian Brueckner, a German citizen, as a suspect in the case.
McCann was 3 years old at the time of her disappearance from an apartment where her family was vacationing in the Algarve seaside town of Praia da Luz.
Brueckner, 45, is serving a sentence on drug offenses in a German prison and has a pending seven-year sentence for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal.
Investigators in the nearby town of Portimao are leading the probe with the assistance of the Judiciary Police, the prosecutors' statement said.

     Portuguese prosecutors say man named formal suspect in McCann case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A suspect has been formally identified in the case of missing British toddler Madeleine McCann, according to a statement by the Prosecutor's Office in Faro, Portugal.
The man has been made an official suspect by German authorities at the request of Portuguese authorities, but the Faro prosecutors did not name him publicly.
It is the first time Portuguese prosecutors have identified an official suspect in the case since Kate and Gerry McCann, Madeleine's parents, were named suspects in 2007.
Despite an international hunt, she has never been found, and no one has ever been charged over her disappearance.
In June 2020, the spokesman for the State Prosecutor's Office of Braunschweig, in the state of Lower-Saxony, told CNN his office assumes McCann is dead.

     Summary: Members of Scotland Yard work at an area during the search for missing British girl Madeleine McCann in Praia da Luz, near Lagos, June 8, 2014.
REUTERS/Carlos Vidigal/File PhotoMADRID, April 22 (Reuters) - Portuguese prosecutors said late on Thursday a man had been formally identified as a suspect in the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann 15 years ago.
He is behind bars in Germany for raping a woman in the Algarve region where Madeleine went missing in 2007.
Here are details about the main developments in the McCann case, one of Britain’s biggest unsolved crimes which attracted worldwide attention and a global hunt.
A British man, whose mother's house was close to the McCann's apartment, also won libel damages from 10 British newspapers after they accused him of being involved in Madeleine’s abduction.
