     “Heartstopper” Tackles LGBTQ+ Bullying With Beauty and Grace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before meeting Nick, he is continually forced to accept belligerent treatment from secret boyfriend Ben Hope (Sebastian Croft).
After Charlie joins the rugby team to get closer to Nick, his teammates spare no time before they start laying on the homophobic insults.
As Nick sees the abuse Charlie receives, he starts fighting back in a big way.
As Harry hurls one of the most infamous anti-gay slurs towards Charlie behind his back, Nick sends fists flying.
It rather solves them the way they should be in the real world, if only we were absent of bigotry and ignorance.

     Heartstopper review – possibly the loveliest show on TV
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Heartstopper (Netflix) may not quite live up to the dramatic promise of its title, but this adorable teen romance is a heartwarmer, at the very least.
(There is much on-screen messaging in this, and watching characters write, delete, rewrite and re-delete their replies is tensely effective.)
Charlie’s friend Elle wonders if she has feelings for their other friend, Tao, and hearts appear in the air.
There are minor dramas among Charlie’s friends, but mostly it’s about Charlie and Nick.
But by the time I finish Heartstopper, I understand its appeal.
