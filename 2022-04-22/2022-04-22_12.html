     Verstappen tops Leclerc while Hamilton caught out in F1 Imola qualifying
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: IMOLA, Italy — Formula One champion Max Verstappen earned his first pole position of the F1 season after an incident-packed session Friday, beating Charles Leclerc while Lewis Hamilton was caught out in qualifying for the sprint race at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.
There were five red flags in qualifying, including three in the final Q3 round on a rain-sodden day at Imola.
The last red flag cut qualifying short with Red Bull driver Verstappen 0.779 seconds ahead of series leader Charles Leclerc in his Ferrari and 1.132 ahead of McLaren’s Lando Norris.
There was also more disappointment for Mercedes after Lewis Hamilton and Russell went out in Q2, too.
Qualifying was also stopped with three minutes remaining following an incident for Bottas as Verstappen went quickest.

     Why Verstappen escaped F1 investigation despite yellow flags on pole lap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Verstappen was one of the first cars through there, and duly completed his lap to secure a session-topping time.
He makes clear there is a big distinction between how drivers must behave when there is a double yellow and what happens when there is a single yellow.
Had the double yellow flags been put out for Bottas' incident, then Verstappen would have had no choice but to abandon his lap.
With just a single warning flag out, the FIA demands: "Drivers should reduce their speed and be prepared to change direction.
In Verstappen's case, it is obvious from the onboard footage of his pole lap that he duly took the right action.

     Max Verstappen beats rain and Leclerc to take F1 Imola GP sprint race pole
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By its close Red Bull’s Max Verstappen had earned “pole position” but such is the equally painful structuring of this format, while his pole counts statistically in the record books it is only for Saturday’s sprint race which will decide the literal pole for Sunday’s GP.
Photograph: Dan Istitene/Formula 1/Getty Images“It was a hectic, long qualifying,” said Verstappen, who was nonetheless pleased F1 was racing at Imola.
Saturday’s 21-lap sprint race will not only decide the grid for Sunday’s race but world championship points will also be awarded to the top eight finishers on a scale from eight to one.
The sprint race was trialled last year and the format has been tweaked but the most significant issue around it remains unsatisfactory.
This year F1 have decided that for statistical purposes the quickest driver on Friday will be deemed to have taken pole position but the sprint race will still decide the grid for Sunday’s grand prix.

     Summary: Leclerc then surged ahead on a 1m39.325s before Verstappen responded with two better efforts that brought the quickest time down to a 1m36.158s.
Perez moved ahead on a 1m35.476s before a lull in proceedings around the halfway point preceded several drivers – including the Aston Martin pair – venturing out on the intermediates for the first time.
Leclerc then used his sent of inters to move back ahead on a 1m32.512s – but only after he had half spun exiting the Villeneuve on his out-lap.
Then came Perez, Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel, with Yuki Tsunoda ninth for AlphaTauri.
Norris ended up 14th, as Latifi, who went off into the gravel at the Tosa hairpin during the early laps, bringing up the rear of the field.

     2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix Qualifying report and highlights: Verstappen takes pole position ahead of Imola Sprint
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Max Verstappen took pole position for Red Bull in a nailbiting qualifying session ahead of the inaugural F1 Sprint of 2022 at Imola.
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc took P2 after being hampered by a late red flag, while Lando Norris managed P3 on the grid for McLaren.
Q2 saw a greater threat of rain, Verstappen topping those timesheets before Sainz crashed from P2 – and then the clouds unleashed.
Norris took third for McLaren but slid off track in the final seconds of Q3, while Kevin Magnussen finished a fine fourth for Haas and Fernando Alonso rounded out the top five for Alpine.
Verstappen led Leclerc out but, given how difficult their out-laps seemed, it was clear that neither driver would improve.

     Emilia Romagna GP: Verstappen grabs F1 sprint pole in disrupted session
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That prevented a final one-lap shootout for first on the grid for the Saturday sprint contest, which left Verstappen atop the times ahead of Leclerc, Norris and Kevin Magnussen.
That caution then morphed into another red flag in response to Valtteri Bottas parking up in his Alfa Romeo C42 on the downhill approach to Rivazza with a technical issue.
The front-left assembly bore the brunt, and the red flag was thrown before rain duly arrived.
Alexander Albon caused a red flag only six minutes into Q1 as the Williams FW44 endured its latest brake failure, like that which hit Nicholas Latifi in Bahrain testing.
That left Yuki Tsunoda to be the first driver to miss out on progressing into the second part of qualifying.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 24-year-old Dutchman drove his Red Bull with care and aplomb to avoid problems on a day of frequent crashes and five red flags that left Ferrari’s championship leader frustrated.
Sergio Perez was seventh in the second Red Bull ahead of Valtteri Bottas of Alfa Romeo and four-time champion Sebastian Vettel of Aston Martin.
Sainz responded, going top, but Verstappen went faster before the Spaniard crashed to bring another red flag.
Out with Russell and Hamilton went Mick Schumacher of Haas, Zhou Guanyu of Alfa Romeo and Stroll.
The third qualifying session started with nine cars out quickly -- Sainz was unable to take part -- in tricky conditions.
