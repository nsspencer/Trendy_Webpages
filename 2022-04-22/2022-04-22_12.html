     Summary: The fifth season of Netflix's Selling Sunset is officially out, and as soon as you finish binge-watching over the weekend, we guarantee you're going to want more new episodes.
"We should dig deeper into what makes a property a good property like what's a good investment and what do you need to stay away from," the star realtor continued.
I don't think we've really hit on these kinds of things and I believe it would be educational for people if we did."
"It opens the door to that and I get to be involved and see what my fans want to hear and what's going on in their lives."
Apart from the digital world, Fitzgerald also plans to get her cast together for a group trip ahead of future filming.
