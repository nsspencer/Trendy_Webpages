Another woman from the same activist group chained herself to the basket during Game 1 between the Timberwolves and Grizzlies at FedExForum on April 16.
She was wearing a shirt that read, "Glen Taylor Roasts Animals Alive."
The Grizzlies entered Saturday's Game 4 with a 2-1 series lead over the Timberwolves.
