     Suspect in Sniper-Style Shooting in Washington Kills Himself, Police Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During an earlier news conference, the police said they were searching for a “person of interest,” Raymond Spencer, 23, of Fairfax, Va., whom they wanted to question.
Mr. Spencer’s name emerged “based upon the things we have seen on social media,” said Stuart Emerman, assistant chief of the Metropolitan Police Department.
Later in the night, Chief Contee said he would not release the name of the deceased suspect until the family was notified.
Chief Contee said the investigation was ongoing.
Possible video of the attack circulated online and depicted bursts of rapid gunfire from an elevated location.

     Suspect in shooting that injured four near Washington school found dead, police say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A gunman opened fire on random victims from a sniper’s nest on the upper floor of an apartment building near an elite prep school in Washington, wounding four people before taking his own life as police burst into his dwelling.
Police had issued a bulletin with photographs of Spencer hours earlier saying they were seeking him as a “person of interest” in their investigation.
The school and other properties in the vicinity were placed under a security lockdown, with frightened students texting anxious parents as police mounted a door-to-door search for the suspect.
A fourth victim, a woman in her mid-60s, was treated on the scene for a slight graze wound, Emerman said.
Eyewitnesses said they heard multiple bursts of gunfire in the upscale Van Ness neighbourhood of north-west Washington next to the Edmund Burke School just as classes were about to be dismissed for the day.

     Washington, D.C. shooting suspect had 'sniper-type setup,' authorities say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A suspect in a Washington, D.C. shooting that left four people injured used a "sniper-type setup" and fired more than 20 rounds, authorities said Friday.
It wasn't immediately clear if the suspect was Raymond Spencer, 23, who authorities identified earlier as a person of interest.
"Obviously his intent was to kill and hurt members of our community," Contee told reporters.
The Edmund Burke prep school was locked down, and parents hoping to retrieve children were told to wait, Emerman said.
Contee said it wasn't clear if the alleged gunman had a connection to the Edmund Burke school.
