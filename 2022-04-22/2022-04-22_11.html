     U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn responds to lingerie photos :: WRAL.com
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: North Carolina U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn responded Friday to photos circulating online apparently showing him wearing lingerie and drinking from a wine glass.
The congressman from western North Carolina called the pictures “goofy vacation photos” taken well before he decided to run for Congress.
Cawthorn on Twitter appeared to acknowledge the veracity of the photos, suggesting the images that were first reported by Politico came from a game he participated in during a cruise trip.
Cawthorn further made light of the photos by asking for followers to share their own embarrassing vacation photos.
He is running against seven GOP opponents, with state Sen. Chuck Edwards posing the most formidable challenge on the ideologically centered lane, while local GOP official Michele Woodhouse challenges Cawthorn from the right.
