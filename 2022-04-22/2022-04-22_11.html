     Summary: Debanhi Escobar, a 18-year-old law student, vanished on April 9, amid a spate of disappearances of women in Nuevo Leon's capital Monterrey that has sparked protests and intensified international scrutiny of gender violence in Mexico.
read moreTwenty-six women and girls have disappeared in Nuevo Leon since the beginning of the year and five more have been found dead after being reported missing.
The state attorney general's office said no one is currently in custody in relation to the case.
On Friday afternoon, hundreds of women marched to the attorney general's office and then onto a busy downtown highway, paralyzing rush hour traffic, to protest gender violence.
"I'm here for all the daughters of Nuevo Leon, because we want a state that's safe and free for them," said Adriana Flores, 45.

     Mystery disappearance of Debanhi Escobar solved as teen’s body found in motel cistern after final picture by roadside
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: THE body of a teenager pictured in a haunting final image has been found in a motel cistern, according to the girl's devastated father.
Debanhi Escobar was last seen two weeks ago standing on a highway dubbed "death road" before she vanished into thin air.
The pal contacted an off-duty taxi driver known to the trio - identified only as 47-year-old Jesús - to take Debhani home.
Cab driver Jesús, who mysteriously had his rideshare app turned off on the trip, then dumped Debhani on the side of the road.
Taxi driver Jesús then took the final image of Debhani last seen alive to send to her friends at around 5am on April 9.

     Mexican woman’s body found in cistern after her haunting last photo went viral
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The disappearance of an 18-year-old Mexican woman, whose haunting last photograph was widely shared on social media, came to a tragic end when her decomposing body was found inside a motel’s subterranean water tank.
Mario Escobar, the young woman’s father, was outside the roadside motel where his daughter’s body was unearthed from a 12-foot deep water tank, which the Associated Press reported ran alongside the facility’s pool.
“The prosecutors didn’t do their job correctly.”Authorities have not disclosed any theories they have as to how the young woman’s body ended up in the tank, but they did report what initially tipped them off.
“The alert was sounded by hotel workers, because of the fetid odors coming from the cistern,” Mejia confirmed to the Associated Press.
As recently as Tuesday the man had been arrested by local police for charges relating to drugs and questioning surrounding the young woman’s disappearance.

     Mexican police find body of missing young woman in cistern
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The story of Debanhi Escobar made headlines because of a haunting photo taken by a driver who was supposed to take her home that night.
The driver, who worked for a taxi app, took the photo to show the young woman got out of his car alive April 8 on the outskirts of the city of Monterrey.
There she was, a young woman standing alone at night on the side of a highway, wearing a skirt and high-top sneakers.
The image seemed to speak of the tremendous vulnerability, and the self-assuredness — or desperation — of the young woman.
She said all five young women had been found alive.
