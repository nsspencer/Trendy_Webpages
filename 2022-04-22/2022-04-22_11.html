You want something to be familiar enough that people can get it, but different enough that it’s something new, and I think that’s what everyone was after with this film.

     On Location: How ‘The Northman’ Transformed Northern Ireland’s Landscapes into Iceland on Film
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In early 2020, The Northman production designer Craig Lathrop was ready to hit the ground running in Iceland to film much of director Robert Egger's Viking epic.
He had spent over a week scouting the island country, making stops at the Fjallsárlón glacier lake, Laundmannalaurgar's colorful geothermal pools, lush Þakgil, and Mount Hekla, one of the Iceland's most active volcanoes.
A masterful pivot ensued, expanding The Northman's filming locations across Ireland and Northern Ireland to bring Iceland to life, some 900 miles away.
We went on a scouting expedition to Iceland for a week and a half and that was spectacular.
So often when I'm scouting, I get to see things that people don't get to see when they’re on vacation.

     The True Story Behind The Northman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Not everybody who lived in the Viking Age was a Viking,” Price, the author of Children of Ash and Elm: A History of the Vikings, a definitive account of the Viking Age, told TIME.
This film will hopefully push people to think differently about the Vikings beyond the usual clichés.”It’s true: The Northman, in theaters April 22, is not your usual horned helmet fare.
With The Northman, Eggers hit a new level in his quest for historical truth, striving to perfect even the smallest details in the film, which he co-wrote with Icelandic novelist and poet Sjón.
“The assumption is that [the story of Amleth is] based on something very old, certainly in the Viking Age,” Price said.
The Northman doesn’t give much context as to why Amleth must find this particular sword beyond it being his fate.

     The History Behind Robert Eggers’ ‘The Northman’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As fire burns and a battle rages below a volcano, director Robert Eggers’ tightly packed world falls away into nothing but smoke and blood.
Cold landscapes, fantastical visions, riotous colors and violence work in tandem to conjure the Viking world.
In an email, he says, “The people of the Viking Age inhabited an organic story-world in which tales changed in the telling.
Even in a fictional story like The Northman, the Viking age comes across as an era that was fundamentally human and messy.
But as we discuss in our recent book, the medieval European past generally and the Viking age specifically were places both strange and familiar.

     Summary: But Eggers says using digital effects is still an unfortunate necessity.
I think that as long as you’re using as many practical elements as you can, CG is a good tool.
In The Northman, Amleth and his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), engage in a manhood ritual involving hallucinogens and blood.
“Even the Tree of Kings, as Ethan Hawke’s character describes it, the arboreal family lineage hallucination nonsense, was done with practical elements,” Eggers says.
“It’s always about trying to have as many practical elements as possible.

Despite the brevity of Björk’s moonlit moment, The Northman wouldn’t be complete without her.
“I was introduced to Björk by Robin Carolan, who’s one of the composers,” Eggers told GQ.
What The Northman may lack in Björk, it makes up for in stomach-churning fight sequences with lots of face smashing.
It might not be for everybody, but Björk’s two-minute ASMR seeress role play is any fan’s Valhalla.

Everyone knows that people aren’t making big movies that aren’t superhero movies or franchise movies.
“But also, I pitched that I would make the most entertaining Robert Eggers movie.
“I had a big dream of making a Viking movie and trying to figure out a way to do it in a crazy big epic way.
“It’s exciting when someone takes a swing like this and makes a big movie for the masses with integrity,” said Skarsgård.
