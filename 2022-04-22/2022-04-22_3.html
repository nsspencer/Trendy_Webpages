     Summary: Audio shows Kevin McCarthy planned to urge Trump to resign after Capitol riotEnlarge this image toggle caption Samuel Corum/Getty Images Samuel Corum/Getty ImagesU.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had planned to get former president Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, The New York Times revealed in an audio recording Thursday.
McCarthy said he would alert the former president of his plans to begin an impeachment trial if he did not resign.
"I think this will pass, and that would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.
McCarthy had previously denied having the conversation, saying that an earlier New York Times report was "totally false and wrong."
Trump eventually faced an impeachment charge for inciting an insurrection a week after the riot.

     What Kevin McCarthy Tape Says About Donald Trump: Full Audio Transcript
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MSNBC's Rachel Maddow aired an audio recording last night of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying he was considering calling then President Donald Trump and recommending he resign from office.
The report is based on Burns' and Martin's upcoming book This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America's Future.
McCarthy had issued a statement strongly denying the report and criticizing the newspaper before the audio was released.
A McCarthy spokesperson, Mark Bednar, had also issued a statement before the release of the audio on Thursday, saying: "McCarthy never said he'd call Trump to say he should resign."
At that time, Democrats were pushing hard to impeach Trump and McCarthy addressed the matter in his comments.

     Tape shows Kevin McCarthy said he would urge Trump to resign
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Authors of a new book released audio of House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy saying he planned to urge President Trump to resign over the Jan. 6 riot — hours after McCarthy denied the account.
Why it matters: With the House GOP expected to win the majority in November's midterms, McCarthy — one of Trump's most unabashed allies — is on the doorstep of the Speaker's office.
But what I think I'm going to do is, I'm going to call him."
ET Thursday, the Times posted a story about the call, including a denial from a McCarthy spokesperson: "McCarthy never said he’d call Trump to say he should resign."
A spokesperson told the Times that McCarthy "never said that particular members should be removed from Twitter."

     Kevin McCarthy said he would urge Trump to resign, audio recording reveals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told fellow GOP lawmakers shortly after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection that he would urge then-President Donald Trump to resign, according to audio posted by The New York Times and aired on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show .
In the same conversation, McCarthy told his colleagues he doubted Trump would take the advice to step aside.
And it could threaten McCarthy’s standing with House Republicans aligned with Trump, whose support he will need for votes to become House speaker next year.
Even after the violence, though, McCarthy joined half of the House Republicans in voting to challenge Joe Biden’s election victory.
Within weeks of the siege at the Capitol McCarthy said he did not think Trump provoked the attack, as other prominent Republicans said at the time.
