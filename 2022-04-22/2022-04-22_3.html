     Guy Lafleur, Dynamic Star of the Montreal Canadiens, Dies at 70
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Guy Damien Lafleur was born on Sept. 20, 1951, in Thurso, Quebec, to Rejean and Pierette Lafleur.
“When I was a kid, all we saw on TV was the Canadiens, and all I wanted to be was Béliveau,” he told the Hall, referring to the longtime Canadiens star Jean Béliveau.
He was spectacular in top-tier junior hockey, scoring 103 and 130 goals for the Quebec Ramparts in the 1969-70 and 1970-71 seasons, and the Canadiens selected him with the No.
Lafleur started relatively slowly, scoring 29, 28 and 21 goals in his first three seasons before he broke out with 53 in the 1974-75 season.
With his blond hair flowing in the days before players routinely wore helmets, Lafleur became a star for a storied Montreal franchise, an innovator with a stick in his hands.

     Summary: "You didn't need to see Guy Lafleur's name and number on his sweater when 'The Flower' had the puck on his stick.
"In 1974-75, his fourth year in the NHL, Lafleur transformed from productive to prolific, recording the first of his six straight seasons of at least 50 goals and 119 points.
On one of the most star-studded teams in hockey history, he was the marquee performer, lifting fans out of their seats chanting, 'Guy!
as he dazzled en route to six straight selections as NHL First-Team All-Star right winger and five Stanley Cups.
The National Hockey League mourns the passing of the iconic Guy Lafleur and sends its deepest condolences to his wife, Lise; his sons, Martin and Mark; his mother, Pierrette; his granddaughter, Sienna Rose; his four sisters and the entire Lafleur family; and the millions of hockey fans he thrilled."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It wasn’t until 1974 — when Mr. Lafleur ditched his helmet and let his hair down — that he began to play like a superstar.
Montreal’s winning ways in the 1970s were the cause of frequent celebration, and Mr. Lafleur partook of postgame nightlife.
In 2008, Mr. Lafleur was charged with giving contradicting testimony in a case brought against his son.
Mr. Lafleur was acquitted on appeal, but he claimed that the charges had damaged his reputation and resulted in lost earnings.
“When I was on the ice, I felt like a free man,” Mr. Lafleur told Sports Illustrated in 2000.
