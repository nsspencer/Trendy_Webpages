     Summary: MONTREAL (AP) — Hockey Hall of Famer Guy Lafleur, who helped the Montreal Canadiens win five Stanley Cup titles in the 1970s, has died at age 70.
1 pick in the 1971 NHL draft, Lafleur registered 518 goals and 728 assists in 14 seasons with Montreal.
“We’ll miss you, Number 10.”Nicknamed “The Flower,” LaFleur was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2019 when tumors were discovered by doctors performing emergency quadruple bypass heart surgery.
Lafleur, who retired from the NHL in 1985 after Montreal denied his request for a trade, was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1988.
“As a boy in Montreal, Guy was larger than life to me,” fellow Hall of Fame forward Mario Lemieux said in a statement.

     Summary: It wasn’t until 1974 — when Mr. Lafleur ditched his helmet and let his hair down — that he began to play like a superstar.
Montreal’s winning ways in the 1970s were the cause of frequent celebration, and Mr. Lafleur partook of postgame nightlife.
In 2008, Mr. Lafleur was charged with giving contradicting testimony in a case brought against his son.
Mr. Lafleur was acquitted on appeal, but he claimed that the charges had damaged his reputation and resulted in lost earnings.
“When I was on the ice, I felt like a free man,” Mr. Lafleur told Sports Illustrated in 2000.
