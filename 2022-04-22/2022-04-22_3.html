     Summary: Border Patrol agents and advocacy groups helping migrant families are preparing for what the potential change in policy could mean for national security.
“Title 42 is meant to be a temporary response to the COVID pandemic,” said Sara Ramey, an immigration attorney at the Migrant Center for Human Rights in San Antonio.
Former President Donald Trump enacted Title 42 in 2020.
They were released from Border Patrol custody and left to wait with nowhere to go.
“Border Patrol agents in Del Rio sector and across the country are completely overwhelmed.

     Dem. Rep. Cuellar: Biden hurting party pre-midterm by lifting Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas border Democrat, says President Biden is hurting their party by ending the Trump-era health policy known as Title 42 that allows for the instant deportation of illegal immigrants due to the pandemic.
You know, in talking with some of my Republican colleagues, they’re saying ‘We can’t believe the White House is giving us this narrative.
We can’t believe that they’re hurting Democrat candidates for the November election,’” the congressman told Fox News Digital on Thursday.
And if you look at the independent voters, they’re not happy about this decision.
Mark Kelly of Arizona, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Chris Coons of Delaware and Gary Peters of Michigan have come out asking the administration to reconsider rescinding Title 42.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The White House is “definitely not going to reverse their decision on Title 42,” said Kerri Talbot, deputy director of the advocacy group Immigration Hub.
The White House has suggested to lawmakers that they pass legislation to change the CDC’s authority on the public health order themselves if they were inclined to.
The former administration official said the White House has long been planning for future increases in migration.
But Escobar maintained that Title 42 has not been an effective deterrent.
Some 1.7 million migrants have been expelled under Title 42 since it was first implemented, including asylum seekers.

     End of Title 42 could make it harder to cross southern border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden administration is preparing a return to pre-pandemic border enforcement, a change officials and immigration advocates say will make the border harder to cross, not easier.
The administration hasn’t changed its plan for responding to a potential uptick in migration following the lifting of Title 42 – but it has changed its messaging.
“We have immigration laws that existed before Title 42,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council.
“Let me reiterate again – Title 42 is not an immigration authority.
A return to Title 8, as regular border processing is known, would automatically fix at least two of the top flaws in the Title 42 policy: it triggered repeat border crossings by individuals, and it crippled the U.S. asylum system.

     Sector Chief Gloria Chavez readies El Paso Border Patrol for end of Title 42, return of asylum
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. agencies involved in border security, immigration and refugee care are facing serious staffing shortages and that could complicate the policy shift, Border Patrol El Paso Sector Chief Gloria Chavez told the El Paso Times and the Puente News Collaborative.
Border Patrol in El Paso has seen its ranks decline to about 2,100 agents from 2,400 two years ago.
When Title 42 ends on May 23, Border Patrol will return to processing migrants under Title 8 of the U.S. code, which governs immigration.
'Array of options' to manage borderTitle 8 gives Border Patrol "an amazing array of options" to manage the border, said Peter Hermansen, a retired Border Patrol director of special operations.
Now, Chavez said, Border Patrol agents in El Paso digitally log requests into a "case acceptance system" and ICE immediately schedules a pickup.

     Summary: Migrants have resorted to living here as the U.S. continues to expel migrants under Title 42 — the pandemic-related border restriction known as Title 42 set to end by May 23.
(Juan Figueroa / Staff Photographer)Growing uneaseGrowing unease over whether federal authorities are ready for what lies ahead is spurring on a backlash against the lifting of Title 42.
Cornyn has supported a legislative proposal that would delay the end of Title 42 by at least 60 days.
He said this week he wants details on a “well-thought-out plan.” Otherwise, he said, the end of Title 42 should be delayed.
Others continue to outright oppose Title 42 and want it lifted now, such as Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso.
