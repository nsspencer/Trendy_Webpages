     David Skogman Transfers; Bulls Sign Two
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Redshirt sophomore center David Skogman has transferred to Davidson.
Skogman showed strong improvement in his game during his sophomore year, averaging 8 points per game and 6.3 rebounds and was the starter in his last 26 games of the year.
Skogman was a strong shooter, at 58.7% and even from beyond the arc, Skogman shot well (37.5%) somewhat rare for a 6–10 player.
On January 28, 2020, Powell, a Kobe Bryant fan, poured in 81 points and missed his final free throw to keep his total at 81, which was also Bryant’s career high.
Kanye Jones transfers from Boston College, after playing one year.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What didn’t help was the fact that maybe the most hated Bucks player was having himself a night.
Grayson Allen single-handedly ripped the heart out of Chicago Bulls fans and took life out of the United Center.
Of course, Allen’s infamous foul on Alex Caruso earlier in the season made him easy for Bulls fans to hate.
Throughout the rest of the game, Allen was aggressive going to the bucket on occasion and made some rather impressive finishes.
Not a single Bulls player outscored Allen, nor did they come close to his +15 in the plus/minus category.

     Summary: Donovan wants more space, pace vs.
Donovan and his team did that Saturday afternoon at the Advocate Center in advance of Sunday’s Game 4.
“They were the aggressor, the more physical team,” Donovan said Saturday.
Though Donovan said the decision didn’t catch the Bulls off guard, talking about the possibility and experiencing it are two different things.
“They’ve got to wrap their head around the fact whether it was a triple overtime game and lost on a halfcourt buzzer beater or we lost by 75 points, it’s all one game,” Donovan said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)Chicago Bulls: Is attacking Giannis on offense the right game plan to stick with?
by Candice EvansThe Chicago Bulls’ victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 2 was led by more than just DeMar DeRozan’s scoring.
Yes, DeRozan’s 41 points played a vital role in the Bulls’ ability to steal home-court advantage at the time, but the defensive play of Alex Caruso was arguably the biggest X-factor of the game.
When Caruso was asked if he can tell the Bulls turned their defensive switch back on, he said, “Can you tell?” he asked.
In Game 2, Caruso read Antetokounmpo’s drives much quicker and came on the back-side to trap almost instantly.

     Summary: After a tremendous effort which resulted in a road win in Game Two, the Chicago Bulls had a chance to take a 2-1 series on their home court.
Entire Offense Thrown Out of SyncThe Bulls only scored 81 points in Game Three and failed to score more than twenty points in three of the four quarters.
Bulls having such a hard time attacking the paint because of how well the Bucks guards are pressing Zach and DeMar.
If not, things could get ugly in a hurry if the Bucks hit a groove offensively.
Portis and Allen were the only two Bucks to hit more than two shots from downtown but that was more than enough.

     Summary: After a statement win by the defending NBA champs Friday in Game 3, Portis was talking about his mindset in the laugher.
The player Portis was assigned to guard at the start of the game who posed no threat: Patrick Williams.
It’s important to note that Williams took nine shots, the same amount he had in his solid performance (10 points, nine rebounds) in Game 2.
In the first quarter of Game 3, in which the Bucks outscored the Bulls 33-17 and established their defensive game plan, Williams took only two shots.
The fourth overall pick in the 2020 draft, Williams took four more shots during mop-up time in the fourth quarter.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bulls wanted to make sure they got the attention of the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks.
That's right, the Bulls had a 3-2 lead... and it was pretty much all Bucks from there and back to Bucks home court advantage.
Though in the second quarter, Bulls lead scorer Nikola Vucevic with 19 points set a heck of a screen on...
They had just 10 turnovers for seven Bulls points and held the Bulls, forced to shoot mostly jump shots and not particularly well, to 30 interior points.
Even the shots the Bulls made were difficult, and the Bucks with the rebounding edge kept the Bulls from much transition play.
