“Title 42 is meant to be a temporary response to the COVID pandemic,” said Sara Ramey, an immigration attorney at the Migrant Center for Human Rights in San Antonio.
Former President Donald Trump enacted Title 42 in 2020.

     Dem. Rep. Cuellar: Biden hurting party pre-midterm by lifting Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas border Democrat, says President Biden is hurting their party by ending the Trump-era health policy known as Title 42 that allows for the instant deportation of illegal immigrants due to the pandemic.
You know, in talking with some of my Republican colleagues, they’re saying ‘We can’t believe the White House is giving us this narrative.
We can’t believe that they’re hurting Democrat candidates for the November election,’” the congressman told Fox News Digital on Thursday.
And if you look at the independent voters, they’re not happy about this decision.
Mark Kelly of Arizona, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Chris Coons of Delaware and Gary Peters of Michigan have come out asking the administration to reconsider rescinding Title 42.

     End of Title 42 could make it harder to cross southern border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden administration is preparing a return to pre-pandemic border enforcement, a change officials and immigration advocates say will make the border harder to cross, not easier.
The administration hasn’t changed its plan for responding to a potential uptick in migration following the lifting of Title 42 – but it has changed its messaging.
“We have immigration laws that existed before Title 42,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council.
“Let me reiterate again – Title 42 is not an immigration authority.
A return to Title 8, as regular border processing is known, would automatically fix at least two of the top flaws in the Title 42 policy: it triggered repeat border crossings by individuals, and it crippled the U.S. asylum system.

     Summary: The White House is “definitely not going to reverse their decision on Title 42,” said Kerri Talbot, deputy director of the advocacy group Immigration Hub.
The White House has suggested to lawmakers that they pass legislation to change the CDC’s authority on the public health order themselves if they were inclined to.
The former administration official said the White House has long been planning for future increases in migration.
But Escobar maintained that Title 42 has not been an effective deterrent.
Some 1.7 million migrants have been expelled under Title 42 since it was first implemented, including asylum seekers.

     Public health law must never again be misused to expel asylum seekers: Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The public health justification for Title 42 was spurious at its inception and at odds with the science on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection.
Since the earliest days of the pandemic, public health experts have noted that tried and tested public health measures such as masking, social distancing, improved ventilation and testing can be layered together to allow the safe processing of asylum seekers at US borders3,4.
Indeed, the Title 42 order remained in effect even as masking and vaccination mandates eased around the United States as the Omicron BA.1 wave subsided.
At a time when public health and science have been under assault from the spread of misinformation and disinformation, the CDC, through its own misuse of public health to block the lifesaving right to asylum, further eroded the legitimacy so central to trust in our public health institutions.
And it is equally imperative to ensure that public health is never again weaponized against those seeking protection at the US border.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The deadline for the lifting of Title 42 is a month away — but the Biden administration is under enormous pressure to stall the timeline amid a Democratic mutiny.
Title 42 will be top of the agenda when the Senate returns next week.
But there is also virtually no-one, on any side of the debate, who sees Title 42 as truly rooted in public health concerns.
On Thursday, more than 20 states asked a federal judge to immediately bar the Biden administration from lifting Title 42.
Those are the kinds of modest missteps that Biden can’t afford as the knot around Title 42 grows harder to unpick.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Title 42 allowed U.S. authorities to quickly expel undocumented migrants to Mexico.
But its removal risks pushing the record number of migrants attempting to enter the United States higher still, officials and politicians said.
The official made the comments before the arrival of Julieta Valls Noyes, a senior U.S. migration official, who flew to Mexico this week for talks due to last until the weekend.
U.S. officials are on track to arrest even more migrants at the border with Mexico this year after record-breaking figures in Biden's first year in office.
Thousands more migrants stranded in camps on the U.S-Mexico border have also become prey for extortion, they say.

     Sector Chief Gloria Chavez readies El Paso Border Patrol for end of Title 42, return of asylum
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. agencies involved in border security, immigration and refugee care are facing serious staffing shortages and that could complicate the policy shift, Border Patrol El Paso Sector Chief Gloria Chavez told the El Paso Times and the Puente News Collaborative.
Border Patrol in El Paso has seen its ranks decline to about 2,100 agents from 2,400 two years ago.
When Title 42 ends on May 23, Border Patrol will return to processing migrants under Title 8 of the U.S. code, which governs immigration.
'Array of options' to manage borderTitle 8 gives Border Patrol "an amazing array of options" to manage the border, said Peter Hermansen, a retired Border Patrol director of special operations.
Now, Chavez said, Border Patrol agents in El Paso digitally log requests into a "case acceptance system" and ICE immediately schedules a pickup.
