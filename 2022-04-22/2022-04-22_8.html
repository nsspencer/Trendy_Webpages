     Lewis Hamilton on F1 season struggles: 'Each weekend is a rescue'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: IMOLA, Italy -- Lewis Hamilton is hoping to salvage a result from this weekend's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix after qualifying 13th on the grid ahead of Saturday's sprint qualifying race.
The seven-time champion failed to make the top-ten shootout in Friday's qualifying session after struggling for performance in wet conditions.
Saturday's sprint race will reward points to the top eight finishers and set the grid for Sunday's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola.
But the Mercedes driver blamed the performance of the car, which has received several updates ahead of this weekend, over the conditions.
"We'll work as hard as we can to move up in the sprint race -- it will be a difficult race.

     Why Verstappen escaped F1 investigation despite yellow flags on pole lap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Verstappen was one of the first cars through there, and duly completed his lap to secure a session-topping time.
He makes clear there is a big distinction between how drivers must behave when there is a double yellow and what happens when there is a single yellow.
Had the double yellow flags been put out for Bottas' incident, then Verstappen would have had no choice but to abandon his lap.
With just a single warning flag out, the FIA demands: "Drivers should reduce their speed and be prepared to change direction.
In Verstappen's case, it is obvious from the onboard footage of his pole lap that he duly took the right action.

"The target was to put a banker lap in, knowing that the rain was going to come,” Sainz said.
“Honestly I knew I was P1, P2 the whole session, and I wasn’t pushing really that hard at all.
The car surprised me in that corner, [and] I missed it.
Sainz said the target at Imola was now “to move forward and try and rescue some good points” over the sprint race and grand prix.

     Summary: Motorsport.com understands that F1 is therefore considering developing the sprint race into a standalone event for next season.
Read Also: F1 considering standalone sprint race plan for 2022Haas driver Kevin Magnussen, who will contest his first sprint event this weekend after spending last season in the IMSA SportsCar Championship, also supported Friday qualifying setting both grids.
If the qualifying on Friday meant the grid position for Sunday, and also for the sprint race, that could be quite fun.
"You add another spectacle point to the weekend…you can fully go for it in the sprint race."
I thought that was the whole idea of the sprint race - to make it interesting for the fans.

     Max Verstappen beats rain and Leclerc to take F1 Imola GP sprint race pole
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By its close Red Bull’s Max Verstappen had earned “pole position” but such is the equally painful structuring of this format, while his pole counts statistically in the record books it is only for Saturday’s sprint race which will decide the literal pole for Sunday’s GP.
Photograph: Dan Istitene/Formula 1/Getty Images“It was a hectic, long qualifying,” said Verstappen, who was nonetheless pleased F1 was racing at Imola.
Saturday’s 21-lap sprint race will not only decide the grid for Sunday’s race but world championship points will also be awarded to the top eight finishers on a scale from eight to one.
The sprint race was trialled last year and the format has been tweaked but the most significant issue around it remains unsatisfactory.
This year F1 have decided that for statistical purposes the quickest driver on Friday will be deemed to have taken pole position but the sprint race will still decide the grid for Sunday’s grand prix.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Speaking to Sky Sports F1 after FP1 had finished, Wolff said “we had George bouncing so much that he actually broke the stay on the floor.
The stays attempt to stiffen the floors that are flexing and stalling at top speed, which leads to porpoising.
But Wolff reckons the large gaps to the championship leader in practice were “all about getting grip into the tyre [with] temperature”.
“When you are able to unlock that issue, you will do a jump and where that will end, I don’t know.
“I think there will be quite some discrepancies in performance and you could see a team [really behind in qualifying later on Friday].

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: IMOLA, Italy — Formula One champion Max Verstappen earned his first pole position of the F1 season after an incident-packed session Friday, beating Charles Leclerc while Lewis Hamilton was caught out in qualifying for the sprint race at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.
There were five red flags in qualifying, including three in the final Q3 round on a rain-sodden day at Imola.
The last red flag cut qualifying short with Red Bull driver Verstappen 0.779 seconds ahead of series leader Charles Leclerc in his Ferrari and 1.132 ahead of McLaren’s Lando Norris.
There was also more disappointment for Mercedes after Lewis Hamilton and Russell went out in Q2, too.
Qualifying was also stopped with three minutes remaining following an incident for Bottas as Verstappen went quickest.

     2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix Qualifying report and highlights: Verstappen takes pole position ahead of Imola Sprint
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Max Verstappen took pole position for Red Bull in a nailbiting qualifying session ahead of the inaugural F1 Sprint of 2022 at Imola.
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc took P2 after being hampered by a late red flag, while Lando Norris managed P3 on the grid for McLaren.
Q2 saw a greater threat of rain, Verstappen topping those timesheets before Sainz crashed from P2 – and then the clouds unleashed.
Norris took third for McLaren but slid off track in the final seconds of Q3, while Kevin Magnussen finished a fine fourth for Haas and Fernando Alonso rounded out the top five for Alpine.
Verstappen led Leclerc out but, given how difficult their out-laps seemed, it was clear that neither driver would improve.
