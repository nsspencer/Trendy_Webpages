     Robert Eggers Changed ‘Northman’ Dialogue in Post After Test Screenings Confused Audiences
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The Northman” used the Nordic past as its North Star, but after test audiences reportedly balked at the film’s dense historical accuracy, writer-director Robert Eggers and co-writer Sjón had to flip the script (literally) in post-production.
Yet the intense long shots and grueling filming schedule meant that any changes — including dialogue — were confined to the editing room.
“Sjón said it was our job to interpret the studio notes in a way that make us proud,” Eggers continued.
It would’ve been so easy to say, ‘Fuck the studio, they’re giving me all these notes, I hate this!
So this is the cut I’m proud of, but my instinct is not to make entertainment…I promised them the most entertaining Robert Eggers movie I could make.

     Review: 'The Northman' Deserves More Than Cult Classic Status
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a recent interview, the director Robert Eggers reflected on the experience of helming his first potential blockbuster.
The Northman, out now, is, he said, "literally an epic” in that it adapts an Icelandic revenge saga, and in that it cost more than $70 million.
This budget allowed him to indulge in glitzy cinematic extravagance: The studio built him three whole villages and numerous viking ships.
As such, The Northman, then, is more gore than Thor, an arty offering that’ll likely attain cult classic status before it gets boffo box office.
He can see his father, the king, played by Ethan Hawke, returning with his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang).

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's a different kind of Shakespherean adaptation than one of the most famous of this genre: Stephen Spielberg's " West Side Story ."
Where "The Northman" elides Shakespeare's text, "West Side Story" is a refraction of adaptations.
And scholars like me love Shakespherean adaptations because they show the wild ways literature moves through history.
The joys of Shakespherean adaptations come in tracking down and mapping out the complex, centuries-long literary histories behind them.
Shakespherean adaptations call us beyond expressions of personal taste into understandings of how we got here.

     How to Watch 'The Northman': Is the Alexander Skarsgård Movie Streaming or in Theatres?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Loosely based on the Scandinavian legend of Amleth, The Northman stars Alexander Skarsgård as a Viking warrior prince who undergoes a bloody quest for revenge against the men who killed his father.
Eggers came up with the idea for The Northman after a meeting with his leading man Alexander Skarsgård, who spoke about his wish to star in a Viking movie.
Eggers wrote the screenplay for The Northman with Sjon, an Icelandic poet, novelist, and lyricist, who previously co-wrote the folk horror movie, Lamb.
Currently, the only place to watch The Northman is in movie theaters.
Skarsgård, a native of Sweden, had wanted to do a Viking movie for a decade before a meeting with Eggers in 2019 led to them making The Northman.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The Northman,” a blood-drenched viking epic from director Robert Eggers, pillaged $1.35 million from 2,700 theaters in Thursday previews, while “The Bad Guys,” a kid-friendly spin on the heist genre, earned $1.15 million from 3,000 theaters.
Universal’s indie label Focus released “The Northman,” which is projected to earn $10 million to $15 million in its first three days of release.
“The Bad Guys,” a Dreamworks Animation film, which has enjoyed good reviews from critics, is on track to gross between $15 million to $20 million.
“The Bad Guys” tells the story of a gang of crooks who try to go straight.
“The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” is also looking like a box office whiff and is eyeing an $8 million launch.

     Movie Review: Robert Eggers’s ‘The Northman’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But in this film, she’s practically demonic in that moment, a degenerate flying in the face of the particular Viking social order Amleth has dedicated himself to restoring.
The film is the third from writer-director Robert Eggers, who shares a screenplay credit here with the Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón.
The Northman doesn’t invite its viewers into its world, but instead dares them to try to catch up.
The Northman may be about the familiar motivation of revenge, but it’s even more remote in its belief system.
The Northman benefits from surrendering to that sense of remove, to its hero’s unforgiving understanding of the universe having been created to reward violence.

Everyone knows that people aren’t making big movies that aren’t superhero movies or franchise movies.
“But also, I pitched that I would make the most entertaining Robert Eggers movie.
“I had a big dream of making a Viking movie and trying to figure out a way to do it in a crazy big epic way.
“It’s exciting when someone takes a swing like this and makes a big movie for the masses with integrity,” said Skarsgård.

     Summary: The first challenge of The Northman is that no historical advisor can give Robert that level of detail for the Viking Age.
There’s a banquet scene early on, and we don’t know what Viking tables looked like.
We don’t know what they did, but they wrote all over the walls.
We don’t know what that is but Robert decided, for his film, to make that the Tree of Kings.
It is invented because I don’t know what Valkyries’ helmets are like.
