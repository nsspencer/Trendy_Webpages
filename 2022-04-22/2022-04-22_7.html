     Robert Eggers Changed ‘Northman’ Dialogue in Post After Test Screenings Confused Audiences
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The Northman” used the Nordic past as its North Star, but after test audiences reportedly balked at the film’s dense historical accuracy, writer-director Robert Eggers and co-writer Sjón had to flip the script (literally) in post-production.
Yet the intense long shots and grueling filming schedule meant that any changes — including dialogue — were confined to the editing room.
“Sjón said it was our job to interpret the studio notes in a way that make us proud,” Eggers continued.
It would’ve been so easy to say, ‘Fuck the studio, they’re giving me all these notes, I hate this!
So this is the cut I’m proud of, but my instinct is not to make entertainment…I promised them the most entertaining Robert Eggers movie I could make.

     Review: 'The Northman' Deserves More Than Cult Classic Status
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a recent interview, the director Robert Eggers reflected on the experience of helming his first potential blockbuster.
The Northman, out now, is, he said, "literally an epic” in that it adapts an Icelandic revenge saga, and in that it cost more than $70 million.
This budget allowed him to indulge in glitzy cinematic extravagance: The studio built him three whole villages and numerous viking ships.
As such, The Northman, then, is more gore than Thor, an arty offering that’ll likely attain cult classic status before it gets boffo box office.
He can see his father, the king, played by Ethan Hawke, returning with his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang).

     The History Behind Robert Eggers’ ‘The Northman’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As fire burns and a battle rages below a volcano, director Robert Eggers’ tightly packed world falls away into nothing but smoke and blood.
Cold landscapes, fantastical visions, riotous colors and violence work in tandem to conjure the Viking world.
In an email, he says, “The people of the Viking Age inhabited an organic story-world in which tales changed in the telling.
Even in a fictional story like The Northman, the Viking age comes across as an era that was fundamentally human and messy.
But as we discuss in our recent book, the medieval European past generally and the Viking age specifically were places both strange and familiar.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's a different kind of Shakespherean adaptation than one of the most famous of this genre: Stephen Spielberg's " West Side Story ."
Where "The Northman" elides Shakespeare's text, "West Side Story" is a refraction of adaptations.
And scholars like me love Shakespherean adaptations because they show the wild ways literature moves through history.
The joys of Shakespherean adaptations come in tracking down and mapping out the complex, centuries-long literary histories behind them.
Shakespherean adaptations call us beyond expressions of personal taste into understandings of how we got here.

     Summary: The first challenge of The Northman is that no historical advisor can give Robert that level of detail for the Viking Age.
There’s a banquet scene early on, and we don’t know what Viking tables looked like.
We don’t know what they did, but they wrote all over the walls.
We don’t know what that is but Robert decided, for his film, to make that the Tree of Kings.
It is invented because I don’t know what Valkyries’ helmets are like.

     Summary: With his latest film, “The Northman,” director Robert Eggers is bringing his distinctive vision behind cult hits “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse” to something exponentially larger — a big-budget Viking epic.
Everyone knows that people aren’t making big movies that aren’t superhero movies or franchise movies.
“But also, I pitched that I would make the most entertaining Robert Eggers movie.
“I had a big dream of making a Viking movie and trying to figure out a way to do it in a crazy big epic way.
“It’s exciting when someone takes a swing like this and makes a big movie for the masses with integrity,” said Skarsgård.

     Movie Review: Robert Eggers’s ‘The Northman’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But in this film, she’s practically demonic in that moment, a degenerate flying in the face of the particular Viking social order Amleth has dedicated himself to restoring.
The film is the third from writer-director Robert Eggers, who shares a screenplay credit here with the Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón.
The Northman doesn’t invite its viewers into its world, but instead dares them to try to catch up.
The Northman may be about the familiar motivation of revenge, but it’s even more remote in its belief system.
The Northman benefits from surrendering to that sense of remove, to its hero’s unforgiving understanding of the universe having been created to reward violence.
