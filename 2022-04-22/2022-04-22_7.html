     McCarthy Said Trump Acknowledged ‘Some Responsibility’ for Jan. 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, told G.O.P.
lawmakers in the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that former President Donald J. Trump acknowledged he bore “some responsibility” for what happened that day, new audio revealed on Friday.
The audio obtained by The New York Times is part of a series of revelations about Republican leaders’ private condemnations of Mr. Trump in the days after his supporters stormed the Capitol.
Mr. McCarthy’s assertion would be the clearest indication yet that Mr. Trump may have admitted some measure of culpability for the deadly mob.
“Let me be very clear to all of you, and I have been very clear to the president: He bears responsibilities for his words and actions,” Mr. McCarthy told House Republicans on a Jan. 11 conference call.

     Kevin McCarthy Would Have a Lot of Explaining to Do Right Now If Republicans Had Any Capacity for Shame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shortly after the Times’ story ran, McCarthy released a statement forcefully denying this ever happened.
It read: “The New York Times’ reporting on me is totally false and wrong.
All words that would mean something if, in fact, the story about McCarthy had been wrong.
Maybe even a line about knowing he’s got a lot of work to do to regain people’s trust!
But, of course, that’s not the world we live in, and Republicans do not actually have any ability to feel shame.

     Summary: Audio reveals Kevin McCarthy planned to urge Trump to resign after Capitol riotEnlarge this image toggle caption Samuel Corum/Getty Images Samuel Corum/Getty ImagesU.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had planned to get former President Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, The New York Times revealed in an audio recording Thursday.
"I think this will pass, and that would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.
In January, the committee asked McCarthy to appear and share more about his interest to have Trump resign.
Tensions had been high between McCarthy and Trump on Jan. 6McCarthy and Trump had a shouting match during a phone call during the Jan. 6 attack, where McCarthy pleaded with Trump to take notice that the rioters were Trump supporters.
Days later, McCarthy took to the House floor later to say Trump "bears responsibility" for his role in the attack.

     Kevin McCarthy’s Sloppy, Artless Lie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is not only a demonstrable liar; he’s also a sloppy and inartful one.
David A. Graham: Marjorie Taylor Greene is just a symptom of what ails the GOPMcCarthy’s reported comments were especially revelatory.
Deviating from the Trump line is politically hazardous for any Republican, and Trump was furious about McCarthy’s mild public criticism in January 2021.
McCarthy’s Republican detractors have floated the idea of electing Trump speaker of the House.
That bodes ill for Kevin McCarthy’s political career, and worse for American democracy.

     Opinion | Kevin McCarthy Will Live to Lie Again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the Jan. 6 episode, McCarthy briefly turned against Trump.
According to press reports, McCarthy engaged Trump in an “expletive-laced phone call” as the riot boiled over and he begged the president to call off the sacking of the Capitol.
In the days immediately following the rampage, McCarthy said, “The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters.
But by the end of January 2021, McCarthy had flown to Mar-a-Lago to bow and scrape before Trump.
Today, Kevin McCarthy stands as bare naked and shivering as a freshly shorn spring sheep.

     Kevin McCarthy quietly moves to tamp down fallout after damaging audio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "On a phone call right after January 6, I was asked by Liz Cheney about the 25th Amendment and to explain what else would happen," McCarthy told reporters.
I never thought he should resign," McCarthy said when pressed on whether he had ever believed at any point that Trump should resign.
One senior House Republican told CNN on Friday that he had spoken to McCarthy, who relayed to him that "Trump was fine."
"The only one who matters is Trump," the Republican told CNN.
What could ultimately save McCarthy is the size of the Republican majority next year if the GOP wins the House in November.
