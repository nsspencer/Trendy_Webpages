     Lewis Hamilton on F1 season struggles: 'Each weekend is a rescue'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: IMOLA, Italy -- Lewis Hamilton is hoping to salvage a result from this weekend's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix after qualifying 13th on the grid ahead of Saturday's sprint qualifying race.
The seven-time champion failed to make the top-ten shootout in Friday's qualifying session after struggling for performance in wet conditions.
Saturday's sprint race will reward points to the top eight finishers and set the grid for Sunday's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola.
But the Mercedes driver blamed the performance of the car, which has received several updates ahead of this weekend, over the conditions.
"We'll work as hard as we can to move up in the sprint race -- it will be a difficult race.

     Verstappen tops Leclerc while Hamilton caught out in F1 Imola qualifying
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: IMOLA, Italy — Formula One champion Max Verstappen earned his first pole position of the F1 season after an incident-packed session Friday, beating Charles Leclerc while Lewis Hamilton was caught out in qualifying for the sprint race at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.
There were five red flags in qualifying, including three in the final Q3 round on a rain-sodden day at Imola.
The last red flag cut qualifying short with Red Bull driver Verstappen 0.779 seconds ahead of series leader Charles Leclerc in his Ferrari and 1.132 ahead of McLaren’s Lando Norris.
There was also more disappointment for Mercedes after Lewis Hamilton and Russell went out in Q2, too.
Qualifying was also stopped with three minutes remaining following an incident for Bottas as Verstappen went quickest.

     Why Verstappen escaped F1 investigation despite yellow flags on pole lap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Verstappen was one of the first cars through there, and duly completed his lap to secure a session-topping time.
He makes clear there is a big distinction between how drivers must behave when there is a double yellow and what happens when there is a single yellow.
Had the double yellow flags been put out for Bottas' incident, then Verstappen would have had no choice but to abandon his lap.
With just a single warning flag out, the FIA demands: "Drivers should reduce their speed and be prepared to change direction.
In Verstappen's case, it is obvious from the onboard footage of his pole lap that he duly took the right action.

     Max Verstappen beats rain and Leclerc to take F1 Imola GP sprint race pole
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By its close Red Bull’s Max Verstappen had earned “pole position” but such is the equally painful structuring of this format, while his pole counts statistically in the record books it is only for Saturday’s sprint race which will decide the literal pole for Sunday’s GP.
Photograph: Dan Istitene/Formula 1/Getty Images“It was a hectic, long qualifying,” said Verstappen, who was nonetheless pleased F1 was racing at Imola.
Saturday’s 21-lap sprint race will not only decide the grid for Sunday’s race but world championship points will also be awarded to the top eight finishers on a scale from eight to one.
The sprint race was trialled last year and the format has been tweaked but the most significant issue around it remains unsatisfactory.
This year F1 have decided that for statistical purposes the quickest driver on Friday will be deemed to have taken pole position but the sprint race will still decide the grid for Sunday’s grand prix.

"I don't think it's aerodynamic in a very simple sense, because we race quite well, we race clear at the midfield,” he noted.
And likewise, I don't think it'll be a kinematics thing.
And on a day like today, that's always going to be a big problem."

"I don't think it's aerodynamic in a very simple sense, because we race quite well, we race clear at the midfield,” he noted.

That in turn has made it harder for Mercedes to address the issue, as traditional methods don’t work.
