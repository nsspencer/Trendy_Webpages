"I think this will pass, and that would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.
In January, the committee asked McCarthy to appear and share more about his interest to have Trump resign.
Tensions had been high between McCarthy and Trump on Jan. 6McCarthy and Trump had a shouting match during a phone call during the Jan. 6 attack, where McCarthy pleaded with Trump to take notice that the rioters were Trump supporters.
Days later, McCarthy took to the House floor later to say Trump "bears responsibility" for his role in the attack.

     Republican Kevin McCarthy under fire after audio shows he discussed urging Trump to resign

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) speaks to the media on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 2, 2019.
In another audio tape, McCarthy told Republican lawmakers that Trump had admitted bearing some responsibility for the Jan. 6 attack, according to CNN.
U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of the few Republican politicians openly critical of Trump, blasted McCarthy on Twitter on Thursday night over his denial.
"Question for Kevin McCarthy ... how can you honestly feel ok with the lies?
McCarthy's political fate will depend largely on Trump, who remains the most powerful figure in the Republican Party more than a year after he left office.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the Jan. 6 episode, McCarthy briefly turned against Trump.
According to press reports, McCarthy engaged Trump in an “expletive-laced phone call” as the riot boiled over and he begged the president to call off the sacking of the Capitol.
In the days immediately following the rampage, McCarthy said, “The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters.
But by the end of January 2021, McCarthy had flown to Mar-a-Lago to bow and scrape before Trump.
Today, Kevin McCarthy stands as bare naked and shivering as a freshly shorn spring sheep.

     Kevin McCarthy’s Sloppy, Artless Lie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is not only a demonstrable liar; he’s also a sloppy and inartful one.
David A. Graham: Marjorie Taylor Greene is just a symptom of what ails the GOPMcCarthy’s reported comments were especially revelatory.
Deviating from the Trump line is politically hazardous for any Republican, and Trump was furious about McCarthy’s mild public criticism in January 2021.
McCarthy’s Republican detractors have floated the idea of electing Trump speaker of the House.
That bodes ill for Kevin McCarthy’s political career, and worse for American democracy.

     Why it matters that Kevin McCarthy lied
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) speaks at his weekly news conference at the Capitol on July 22, 2021, in Washington.
CNN —On Thursday morning, The New York Times reported that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had told colleagues in the aftermath of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol that he was going to counsel then-President Donald Trump to resign.
But CNN’s Melanie Zanona and Lauren Fox reported that Trump and McCarthy spoke by phone Thursday night and that the former President wasn’t upset.
Because this is what we now know about McCarthy, the top-ranking Republican in the House: He flat-out lied about comments he had made about Trump immediately following the January 6 attacks.
McCarthy said the Times was wrong.

     Liz Cheney denies recording bombshell tape of Kevin McCarthy saying he would urge Trump to resign after Jan. 6 riot

     Summary: "The only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said, according to the recording.
Later Friday, news outlets aired a separate audio clip of McCarthy from Jan. 11, 2021.
In it, McCarthy tells top House Republicans that Trump admitted he bears some responsibility for the Capitol riot.
The vast majority of House Republicans — who would vote on whether to make McCarthy speaker — have stayed loyal to Trump.
"The only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.
