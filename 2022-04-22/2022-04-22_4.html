The date the photos were taken is unclear, though they appear to show Cawthorn sitting in a wheelchair, indicating the event happened after his accident.

     National Rifle Association Throws Weight Behind Cawthorn Reelection
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following a rocky few weeks after accusing fellow GOP colleagues of inviting him to cocaine-fueled orgies, Republican North Carolina Congressman Madison Cawthorn's favorability may be increasing from his recent endorsement by the National Rifle Association (NRA).
Cawthorn is now thankful for the NRA endorsement, hoping to win back GOP support.
"Honored to be endorsed by the NRA for my reelection to Congress!," Cawthorn tweeted.
Last month, Cawthorn led the polls by 32 points against GOP candidate Chuck Edwards, 52 percent to 20 percent.
Cawthorn's recent NRA endorsement may be the boost he needs to win back GOP voters.

     U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn responds to lingerie photos :: WRAL.com
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: North Carolina U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn responded Friday to photos circulating online apparently showing him wearing lingerie and drinking from a wine glass.
The congressman from western North Carolina called the pictures “goofy vacation photos” taken well before he decided to run for Congress.
Cawthorn on Twitter appeared to acknowledge the veracity of the photos, suggesting the images that were first reported by Politico came from a game he participated in during a cruise trip.
Cawthorn further made light of the photos by asking for followers to share their own embarrassing vacation photos.
He is running against seven GOP opponents, with state Sen. Chuck Edwards posing the most formidable challenge on the ideologically centered lane, while local GOP official Michele Woodhouse challenges Cawthorn from the right.
