     Marjorie Taylor Greene Denies ‘Insurrectionist’ Charge in Court
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He maintained that the entire Free Speech for People effort was designed to deny Georgia voters their rights, because the plaintiffs could not defeat Ms. Greene at the ballot box.
It’s a court of law,” Mr. Bopp said.
A separate effort is pending against Republicans, including Senator Ron Johnson, in Wisconsin.
But so far, only the case against Ms. Greene has been allowed to proceed.
And on Friday, she was forced to answer questions under oath.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Greene's defense team has argued the lawsuit is "fundamentally anti-democratic" and that Greene has denounced the violence in the events of Jan. 6.
Driving the news: During Friday's hearing, Greene denied knowing about plans to violently, or even noisily, disrupt Congress' proceedings as they certified electoral votes on Jan. 6.
Asked if, before Jan. 6, she had "heard that people were planning to enter the Capitol on Jan. 6 and engage in violence," Greene repeatedly responded, "No."
Greene said she couldn't remember meetings with lawmakers or the White House about plans for Jan. 6, despite a video showing her at the White House saying she had "a great planning session for our Jan. 6 objection."
Greene also denied that she or her staff communicated with specific Jan. 6 rally organizers.

     Watch Live: Marjorie Taylor Greene testifies against challenge to her candidacy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is testifying in court Friday in an administrative hearing on a challenge seeking to block her from the ballot in Georgia based on a post-Civil War era policy about keeping insurrectionists from office.
Asked repeatedly if she knew of certain groups planning demonstrations on January 6, 2021, Greene responded, "I don't recall."
Greene also repeatedly said she didn't remember if she talked to other members of Congress or anyone in the White House about protests planned for that day.
Ron Fein, the attorney for the group of challengers, Free Speech for the People, said Friday that the "most powerful witness against Marjorie Taylor Greene's candidacy, in establishing she crossed a line, is Greene herself."
The administrative judge in Greene's case, Charles Beaudrot, will make a recommendation to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger about Greene's candidacy, and it will be up to him to decide whether to remove her from the ballot.

A similar challenge to Republican Congressman Madison Cawthorn's candidacy was tossed out by a judge in North Carolina.
Greene asked a federal court to dismiss her challenge, but the judge let the case proceed.
Page Pate, a trial attorney in Georgia, says disqualifying Greene from the ballot might not be the challengers' only goal.
