     The Northman Is a Bloody, Brutal, Brilliant Viking Revenge Epic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To understand The Northman, a bloody, brilliant, brutally bonkers Viking revenge epic based on the Icelandic folktale that inspired Hamlet, it is worth reflecting briefly on the world of journalism.
Hence, The Northman, director Robert Eggers' tale of Viking revenge.
In The Northman, Eggers once again delivers the same sort of obsessively researched period detail, but this time as a far grander spectacle, as he burrows into the bloody, spirit-haunted world of pre-modern Viking culture.
And life is short and expendable, especially to Viking warriors, who view themselves as beasts as much as men.
But it renders no obvious judgment on Viking horrors except the judgment that the Viking warriors rendered on themselves.

     Review: 'The Northman' Deserves More Than Cult Classic Status
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a recent interview, the director Robert Eggers reflected on the experience of helming his first potential blockbuster.
The Northman, out now, is, he said, "literally an epic” in that it adapts an Icelandic revenge saga, and in that it cost more than $70 million.
This budget allowed him to indulge in glitzy cinematic extravagance: The studio built him three whole villages and numerous viking ships.
As such, The Northman, then, is more gore than Thor, an arty offering that’ll likely attain cult classic status before it gets boffo box office.
He can see his father, the king, played by Ethan Hawke, returning with his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang).

     Summary: It's a different kind of Shakespherean adaptation than one of the most famous of this genre: Stephen Spielberg's " West Side Story ."
Where "The Northman" elides Shakespeare's text, "West Side Story" is a refraction of adaptations.
And scholars like me love Shakespherean adaptations because they show the wild ways literature moves through history.
The joys of Shakespherean adaptations come in tracking down and mapping out the complex, centuries-long literary histories behind them.
Shakespherean adaptations call us beyond expressions of personal taste into understandings of how we got here.

     The History Behind Robert Eggers’ ‘The Northman’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As fire burns and a battle rages below a volcano, director Robert Eggers’ tightly packed world falls away into nothing but smoke and blood.
Cold landscapes, fantastical visions, riotous colors and violence work in tandem to conjure the Viking world.
In an email, he says, “The people of the Viking Age inhabited an organic story-world in which tales changed in the telling.
Even in a fictional story like The Northman, the Viking age comes across as an era that was fundamentally human and messy.
But as we discuss in our recent book, the medieval European past generally and the Viking age specifically were places both strange and familiar.

     How to Watch 'The Northman': Is the Alexander Skarsgård Movie Streaming or in Theatres?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Loosely based on the Scandinavian legend of Amleth, The Northman stars Alexander Skarsgård as a Viking warrior prince who undergoes a bloody quest for revenge against the men who killed his father.
Eggers came up with the idea for The Northman after a meeting with his leading man Alexander Skarsgård, who spoke about his wish to star in a Viking movie.
Eggers wrote the screenplay for The Northman with Sjon, an Icelandic poet, novelist, and lyricist, who previously co-wrote the folk horror movie, Lamb.
Currently, the only place to watch The Northman is in movie theaters.
Skarsgård, a native of Sweden, had wanted to do a Viking movie for a decade before a meeting with Eggers in 2019 led to them making The Northman.

     ‘The Northman’ Cuts Its Own Heart Out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The answer is that Robert Eggers’s new period epic The Northman is based on the same 12th century legend that initially inspired William Shakespeare.
Certainly, the nearly $90 million price tag for The Northman suggests a filmmaker who’s currently in fashion.
Like David Lowery’s recent Medievalist fantasia The Green Knight, The Northman is trying to apply state-of-the-art craft to old-school material.
The Northman is a lot of things—bruising, rousing, and often entertaining—but it’s not particularly complex.
And while the film is filled with declarations of passion, The Northman isn’t very emotional.

     The Hardest Day on the Set of The Northman

     Summary: While Eggers has made films set in the past — 2016’s The Witch was a horror film set in Puritan Massachusetts; 2019’s The Lighthouse a psychodrama about turn-of-the-century lighthouse keepers — shootingThe Northman meant working at a scale he never had before.
(Though if you have visions of them sailing down the Danube, I regret to inform you the longships traveled to the Northman set via shipping container, which during the pandemic was its own kind of logistical nightmare.)
The most challenging construction task was the farm of Fjölnir (Claes Bang), where the second half of the film is set.

On the walk to the set, Skarsgård remembers the 12 drained berserkers “crying like children.” But they didn’t have a choice.
