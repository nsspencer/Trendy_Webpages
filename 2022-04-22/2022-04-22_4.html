     Summary: Border Patrol agents and advocacy groups helping migrant families are preparing for what the potential change in policy could mean for national security.
“Title 42 is meant to be a temporary response to the COVID pandemic,” said Sara Ramey, an immigration attorney at the Migrant Center for Human Rights in San Antonio.
Former President Donald Trump enacted Title 42 in 2020.
They were released from Border Patrol custody and left to wait with nowhere to go.

     West Virginia joins lawsuit challenging the termination of Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BRIDGEPORT, W.Va (WDTV) - West Virginia has joined 20 other states in suing the Biden administration for its plan to rescind the public health policy Title 42 during what the Attorney General calls the worst border crisis in decades.
The attorneys general said rescinding Title 42 will worsen the unprecedented crisis at our nation’s southern border.
“This irresponsible move by the Biden Administration shows utter disregard for protecting our Southern Border,” Attorney General Morrisey said.
The attorneys general argue that revoking the policy violates the Administrative Procedure Act.
The lawsuit alleges that revoking Title 42 will create a surge at the southern border, overwhelming law enforcement agencies and non-governmental organizations as well.

     Dem. Rep. Cuellar: Biden hurting party pre-midterm by lifting Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas border Democrat, says President Biden is hurting their party by ending the Trump-era health policy known as Title 42 that allows for the instant deportation of illegal immigrants due to the pandemic.
You know, in talking with some of my Republican colleagues, they’re saying ‘We can’t believe the White House is giving us this narrative.
We can’t believe that they’re hurting Democrat candidates for the November election,’” the congressman told Fox News Digital on Thursday.
And if you look at the independent voters, they’re not happy about this decision.
Mark Kelly of Arizona, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Chris Coons of Delaware and Gary Peters of Michigan have come out asking the administration to reconsider rescinding Title 42.

     Biden White House stands behind Title 42 decision amid party revolt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The White House is “definitely not going to reverse their decision on Title 42,” said Kerri Talbot, deputy director of the advocacy group Immigration Hub.
The White House has suggested to lawmakers that they pass legislation to change the CDC’s authority on the public health order themselves if they were inclined to.
The former administration official said the White House has long been planning for future increases in migration.
But Escobar maintained that Title 42 has not been an effective deterrent.
Some 1.7 million migrants have been expelled under Title 42 since it was first implemented, including asylum seekers.
