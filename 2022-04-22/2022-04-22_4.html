     ‘The Northman’ Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How much you enjoy The Northman depends upon how neat such a cranial bludgeoning sounds to you.
It’s a world of magic and visions, of witches and fools, of Valkyries and Valhalla.
Wounded in battle, he is greeted by his wife, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), and young son Amleth (Oscar Novak).
After some bonding and a vision quest led by court jester Heimir (Willem Dafoe), Aurvandil is betrayed and murdered by his brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who also attempts to slay young Amleth.
But if you’re looking for an unapologetically bloody and masculine movie with just a dash of eerie energy to it, you’ll probably dig The Northman.

     Review: 'The Northman' Deserves More Than Cult Classic Status
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a recent interview, the director Robert Eggers reflected on the experience of helming his first potential blockbuster.
The Northman, out now, is, he said, "literally an epic” in that it adapts an Icelandic revenge saga, and in that it cost more than $70 million.
This budget allowed him to indulge in glitzy cinematic extravagance: The studio built him three whole villages and numerous viking ships.
As such, The Northman, then, is more gore than Thor, an arty offering that’ll likely attain cult classic status before it gets boffo box office.
He can see his father, the king, played by Ethan Hawke, returning with his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang).

Nothing to see here.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's a different kind of Shakespherean adaptation than one of the most famous of this genre: Stephen Spielberg's " West Side Story ."
Where "The Northman" elides Shakespeare's text, "West Side Story" is a refraction of adaptations.
And scholars like me love Shakespherean adaptations because they show the wild ways literature moves through history.
The joys of Shakespherean adaptations come in tracking down and mapping out the complex, centuries-long literary histories behind them.
Shakespherean adaptations call us beyond expressions of personal taste into understandings of how we got here.

     'The Northman' explained: How the Viking epic brings “real authenticity” to Valhalla and Valkyries
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first challenge of The Northman is that no historical advisor can give Robert that level of detail for the Viking Age.
There’s a banquet scene early on, and we don’t know what Viking tables looked like.
We don’t know what they did, but they wrote all over the walls.
We don’t know what that is but Robert decided, for his film, to make that the Tree of Kings.
It is invented because I don’t know what Valkyries’ helmets are like.

     ‘The Northman’ Cuts Its Own Heart Out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The answer is that Robert Eggers’s new period epic The Northman is based on the same 12th century legend that initially inspired William Shakespeare.
Certainly, the nearly $90 million price tag for The Northman suggests a filmmaker who’s currently in fashion.
Like David Lowery’s recent Medievalist fantasia The Green Knight, The Northman is trying to apply state-of-the-art craft to old-school material.
The Northman is a lot of things—bruising, rousing, and often entertaining—but it’s not particularly complex.
And while the film is filled with declarations of passion, The Northman isn’t very emotional.

     The History Behind Robert Eggers’ ‘The Northman’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As fire burns and a battle rages below a volcano, director Robert Eggers’ tightly packed world falls away into nothing but smoke and blood.
Cold landscapes, fantastical visions, riotous colors and violence work in tandem to conjure the Viking world.
In an email, he says, “The people of the Viking Age inhabited an organic story-world in which tales changed in the telling.
Even in a fictional story like The Northman, the Viking age comes across as an era that was fundamentally human and messy.
But as we discuss in our recent book, the medieval European past generally and the Viking age specifically were places both strange and familiar.

     Summary: While Eggers has made films set in the past — 2016’s The Witch was a horror film set in Puritan Massachusetts; 2019’s The Lighthouse a psychodrama about turn-of-the-century lighthouse keepers — shootingThe Northman meant working at a scale he never had before.
(Though if you have visions of them sailing down the Danube, I regret to inform you the longships traveled to the Northman set via shipping container, which during the pandemic was its own kind of logistical nightmare.)
The most challenging construction task was the farm of Fjölnir (Claes Bang), where the second half of the film is set.

On the walk to the set, Skarsgård remembers the 12 drained berserkers “crying like children.” But they didn’t have a choice.
