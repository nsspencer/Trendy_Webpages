     Summary: It wasn’t until 1974 — when Mr. Lafleur ditched his helmet and let his hair down — that he began to play like a superstar.
Montreal’s winning ways in the 1970s were the cause of frequent celebration, and Mr. Lafleur partook of postgame nightlife.
In 2008, Mr. Lafleur was charged with giving contradicting testimony in a case brought against his son.
Mr. Lafleur was acquitted on appeal, but he claimed that the charges had damaged his reputation and resulted in lost earnings.
“When I was on the ice, I felt like a free man,” Mr. Lafleur told Sports Illustrated in 2000.
