     Summary: Audio reveals Kevin McCarthy planned to urge Trump to resign after Capitol riotEnlarge this image toggle caption Samuel Corum/Getty Images Samuel Corum/Getty ImagesU.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had planned to get former President Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, The New York Times revealed in an audio recording Thursday.
"I think this will pass, and that would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.
In January, the committee asked McCarthy to appear and share more about his interest to have Trump resign.
Tensions had been high between McCarthy and Trump on Jan. 6McCarthy and Trump had a shouting match during a phone call during the Jan. 6 attack, where McCarthy pleaded with Trump to take notice that the rioters were Trump supporters.
Days later, McCarthy took to the House floor later to say Trump "bears responsibility" for his role in the attack.

     Kevin McCarthy’s Sloppy, Artless Lie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is not only a demonstrable liar; he’s also a sloppy and inartful one.
David A. Graham: Marjorie Taylor Greene is just a symptom of what ails the GOPMcCarthy’s reported comments were especially revelatory.
Deviating from the Trump line is politically hazardous for any Republican, and Trump was furious about McCarthy’s mild public criticism in January 2021.
McCarthy’s Republican detractors have floated the idea of electing Trump speaker of the House.
That bodes ill for Kevin McCarthy’s political career, and worse for American democracy.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the Jan. 6 episode, McCarthy briefly turned against Trump.
According to press reports, McCarthy engaged Trump in an “expletive-laced phone call” as the riot boiled over and he begged the president to call off the sacking of the Capitol.
In the days immediately following the rampage, McCarthy said, “The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters.
But by the end of January 2021, McCarthy had flown to Mar-a-Lago to bow and scrape before Trump.
Today, Kevin McCarthy stands as bare naked and shivering as a freshly shorn spring sheep.

     Liz Cheney denies recording bombshell tape of Kevin McCarthy saying he would urge Trump to resign after Jan. 6 riot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Liz Cheney on Friday denied recording or leaking audio from a phone call that appears to show House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying he would tell then-President Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
"The only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said, according to the recording.
In it, McCarthy tells top House Republicans that Trump admitted he bears some responsibility for the Capitol riot.
The vast majority of House Republicans — who would vote on whether to make McCarthy speaker — have stayed loyal to Trump.
"The only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.

     Kevin McCarthy’s speakership hopes face new threat from Trump comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There were early indications that Trump aides were downplaying the impact of the new revelations on Trump and McCarthy’s relationship.
The Washington Post first reported on the conversation between McCarthy and Trump.
A spokesperson for Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who heads House Republicans’ campaign arm, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump still commands great sway over House Republicans and his reaction to McCarthy’s newly public comments could ripple across the caucus, as well as among the candidates likely to help Republicans take control of the House next year.
Joining Bannon, Trump associate Boris Epshteyn described the audio as “extremely hurtful to hopes that Kevin McCarthy has to become speaker.”“Kevin McCarthy’s got a big problem,” Epshteyn said.

     Kevin McCarthy quietly moves to tamp down fallout after damaging audio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One senior House Republican told CNN on Friday that he had spoken to McCarthy, who relayed to him that "Trump was fine."
"The only one who matters is Trump," the Republican told CNN.
Plus, McCarthy's initial criticism of Trump after January 6 was already widely known and shared by many others inside the GOP conference.
"This revealed that his relationship with Trump probably isn't as solid as he has let on," said one House GOP member.
What could ultimately save McCarthy is the size of the Republican majority next year if the GOP wins the House in November.
