You find your movie boring?
I hate “The Witch,” but that’s another story.
I mean, I think it’s a horror movie, but I can understand how people looking for a certain formula weren’t satisfied.
You want something to be familiar enough that people can get it, but different enough that it’s something new, and I think that’s what everyone was after with this film.

     ‘The Northman’ Plunders $1.35 Million in Thursday Previews, ‘The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent’ Trails Behind

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A trio of new titles will fight 'Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore' for the top spot this weekend.
The third film in the increasingly irrelevant Harry Potter spinoff series made a franchise-low $43 million in its debut weekend.
The film made $1.35 million in Thursday previews.
The film made $1.15 million from 3,000 theaters in Thursday previews, and is on track to gross between $15 million to $20 million in its opening weekend.
Things were equally grim for The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, which, like its two fellow debutantes, has also earned solid reviews.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Northman, in which director Robert Eggers transforms Alexander Skarsård into legendary Viking Amleth, is the director’s biggest production yet.
Just one problem: Amleth’s mother doesn’t actually want to be saved.
When a grown Amleth (Skarsgård) shows up years later disguised as a slave to exact his revenge and rescue his mother, he discovers not a damsel but a devoted wife.
His brother’s not great, either, but he’s definitely a step up for Amleth’s mother, Nicole Kidman’s Queen Gudrún.
As their figures move in silhouette, it’s hard not to interpret their clashing swords as anything but a phallic joke.

     The True Story Behind The Northman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Not everybody who lived in the Viking Age was a Viking,” Price, the author of Children of Ash and Elm: A History of the Vikings, a definitive account of the Viking Age, told TIME.
This film will hopefully push people to think differently about the Vikings beyond the usual clichés.”It’s true: The Northman, in theaters April 22, is not your usual horned helmet fare.
With The Northman, Eggers hit a new level in his quest for historical truth, striving to perfect even the smallest details in the film, which he co-wrote with Icelandic novelist and poet Sjón.
“The assumption is that [the story of Amleth is] based on something very old, certainly in the Viking Age,” Price said.
The Northman doesn’t give much context as to why Amleth must find this particular sword beyond it being his fate.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As fire burns and a battle rages below a volcano, director Robert Eggers’ tightly packed world falls away into nothing but smoke and blood.
Cold landscapes, fantastical visions, riotous colors and violence work in tandem to conjure the Viking world.
In an email, he says, “The people of the Viking Age inhabited an organic story-world in which tales changed in the telling.
Even in a fictional story like The Northman, the Viking age comes across as an era that was fundamentally human and messy.
But as we discuss in our recent book, the medieval European past generally and the Viking age specifically were places both strange and familiar.

     Summary: Photo: Focus FeaturesThe Northman, Robert Eggers’s Icelandic Viking epic, is a harsh hero’s quest full of action and abs.
Despite the brevity of Björk’s moonlit moment, The Northman wouldn’t be complete without her.
“I was introduced to Björk by Robin Carolan, who’s one of the composers,” Eggers told GQ.
What The Northman may lack in Björk, it makes up for in stomach-churning fight sequences with lots of face smashing.
It might not be for everybody, but Björk’s two-minute ASMR seeress role play is any fan’s Valhalla.

     Summary: With his latest film, “The Northman,” director Robert Eggers is bringing his distinctive vision behind cult hits “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse” to something exponentially larger — a big-budget Viking epic.
Everyone knows that people aren’t making big movies that aren’t superhero movies or franchise movies.
“But also, I pitched that I would make the most entertaining Robert Eggers movie.
“I had a big dream of making a Viking movie and trying to figure out a way to do it in a crazy big epic way.
“It’s exciting when someone takes a swing like this and makes a big movie for the masses with integrity,” said Skarsgård.

You’re known for doing a lot of research before you even begin designing.
You’ve been a working costume designer for over 45 years—is this the biggest project you’ve ever been a part of?
In the research for the Slavic village, I read that the word for embroidery is the word we use for writer.
That’s called a vararfeldr and that is perhaps the most authentic piece of Viking clothing in the film.
