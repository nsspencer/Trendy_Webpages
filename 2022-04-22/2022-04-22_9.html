     Husband of Sherri Papini, woman who lied about 2016 kidnapping, files for divorce, child custody
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The husband of Sherri Papini, a California woman who admitted to making up a 2016 abduction that touched off a nationwide search, filed for divorce and emergency custody of the couple’s two children, according to court documents obtained Friday.
A lawyer for Sherri Papini, 39, declined to comment Friday.
Sherri Papini has not offered an explanation for the fabricated kidnapping plot, which involved two Hispanic women who she claimed held her at gunpoint and branded her.
After reappearing, Sherri Papini sought $30,000 in victim assistance funds and lied to investigators when they confronted her with evidence that her kidnapping was fake.
Sherri Papini is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11.

     Sherri Papini's husband files for divorce, hopes to protect children from her 'notoriety'
    </h2>

     Summary: The filing says Keith and Sherri Papini separated on March 3, which was the day FBI agents arrested her.
"The trauma inflicted on our children at the unexpected loss of their mother was heartbreaking," Keith Papini added.
The article notes how, after disappearing for 22 days, Sherri Papini was found wandering along Interstate 5 north of Sacramento bound with chains on Thanksgiving Day 2016.
Keith Papini stated he doesn't want to say anything in the pleadings that "would inflame the situation or attract media attention."
Pending a May hearing, a judge said Sherri Papini can have telephone and video calls with the children and that Keith Papini can supervise those calls.

     Sherri Papini's Husband Files for Divorce as New Details In Case Get Revealed by 'Dateline'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shasta County Sheriff Sergeant Kyle Wallace tells Dateline NBC that it was ultimately, probably, Papini's "theatrics" that led investigators to question her story and pursue the case against her.
She told investigators she had pulled out her own hair while being abducted at gunpoint to leave as a clue for her husband — which in and of itself struck investigators as odd.
On Wednesday, Keith Papini filed for divorce from Sherri in Shasta County Superior Court, as the Sacramento Bee first reported.
Shasta County Sheriff Michael L. Johnson sounded fully done with the case, and Sherri, in recent comments to the US Sun.

     Summary: Keith Papini, who loyally stood by his wife’s side for six years as Sherri Papini maintained she had been kidnapped, filed for divorce Wednesday, two days after she pleaded guilty to charges that the whole thing was a hoax.
“The trauma inflicted on our children at the unexpected loss of their mother was heartbreaking.”The Papinis have two children, ages 9 and 7 and Keith Papini is requesting sole custody of them.
“The fact that their mother lied to them on such a major issue is something they and I are having a hard time dealing with,” Keith Papini wrote.

Brian Jackson said in an interview in Redding on Thursday that Keith Papini appeared skeptical throughout the ordeal.
