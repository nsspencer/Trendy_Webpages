read moreTwenty-six women and girls have disappeared in Nuevo Leon this year, and five more have been found dead after being reported missing.
Guerrero’s comments came as hundreds of women blocked a highway in downtown Monterrey, paralyzing traffic, demanding an end to gender violence.
"I'm here for all the daughters of Nuevo Leon, because we want a state that's safe and free for them," said Adriana Flores, 45.
The governor, Samuel Garcia, said this week that the local government had mobilized additional resources in the search for Debanhi and other missing women.

     Debanhi Escobar found dead, Mexican police find body of missing woman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The haunting story of a young woman left by a highway late one night in northern Mexico ended in grief when her decomposing body was found in a motel’s groundwater tank.
There she was, a young woman, standing alone on the side of the highway at night, wearing a skirt and high heels.
The number of missing women is also high, with about 1,600 reported missing so far this year.
Just before Debanhi Escobar disappeared, another 27-year-old woman, Maria Fernanda Contreras, was killed in Monterey, and a suspect — apparently a friend or acquaintance of the woman — was arrested.
She said all five young women were found alive.
