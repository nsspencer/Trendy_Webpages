     Phoenix Ghost: What we know about the US’s new drones for Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pentagon says the Phoenix Ghost tactical unmanned aerial system was designed mainly for striking targets.
The new $800m assistance package includes a new unmanned aerial weapons system, or drone, dubbed the Phoenix Ghost.
Not much else is known about the Phoenix Ghost drones, including their range and precise capabilities.
Kirby, however, did say that the drones, which have not yet been delivered to Ukraine, are equipped with onboard cameras.
He added that the systems had been in development since before Russia’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine on February 24.

     Phoenix Ghost Drone Could Be a Major Problem for Russia in Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Agrees to Make “Phoenix Ghost” Drone for Ukraine – A senior defense official told reporters on Thursday that as part of the latest $800 million aid package for Ukraine, the United States Air Force will provide a custom-designed drone for Ukraine named the Phoenix Ghost.
“The Phoenix Ghost is…this was rapidly developed by the Air Force in response, specifically, to Ukrainian requirements,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
We do know that the drone was developed quickly, but information about the specific features baked into the device at the request of Ukrainian military officials has not been revealed.
The United States will work with the Ukrainian military to ensure that all troops are up to speed with how to use the unmanned aerial system.
Ukrainian troops who were present in the United States before the outbreak of the war have been trained to use the Switchblades.

     How Phoenix Ghost Drones Will Help Ukraine Deliver 'Punch' to Russian Army
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington is sending mysterious Phoenix Ghost tactical drones developed by the U.S. Air Force to Ukraine as part of the latest $800 million arms package for the war-torn country.
On Thursday Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby, alongside a senior defense department official, outlined how the new drones will help Ukraine "deliver a punch" to the Russian army.
The Phoenix Ghost drones are likely, then, be able to directly crash into and destroy targets, and won't be recovered.
"We believed that this particular system would very nicely suit their needs, particularly in eastern Ukraine," Kirby told reporters.
The Phoenix Ghost tactical drones also have optical abilities that will assist in strikes against Russian forces, the Pentagon spokesman added.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “This unmanned aerial system is designed for tactical operations—in other words, largely but not exclusively, to attack targets,” Kirby said about the Phoenix Ghost on Thursday.
But the purpose is akin to the Switchblade,” Kirby said.
AdvertisementThe Phoenix Ghost drone was developed by AEVEX Aerospace based in Solana Beach, California, according to Breaking Defense.
While the Pentagon keeps saying the Phoenix Ghost is like the Switchblade, The Drive news outlet points out that doesn’t mean it necessarily is a tube-launched drone like the Switchblade.
Ukraine will receive precisely 121 Phoenix Ghost drone systems, according to the Pentagon.

     Meet the Phoenix Ghost, a secretive new drone the U.S. fast-tracked for delivery to Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The United States has spent roughly $3.4 billion on sending military assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24.
The Phoenix Ghost, an unmanned aerial vehicle, was partly designed with Ukraine in mind, the Pentagon says.
Previously, a different Pentagon official had implied the Phoenix Ghost was created specifically for Ukraine, but Kirby walked back those comments, stating that the drone had been in development long before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion.
The Phoenix Ghost is similar to “switchblade” drones—also known as “kamikaze drones” or “loitering munitions”—the U.S. has already delivered to Ukraine in that it doesn’t fire on an enemy from a far distance.
“[The Phoenix Ghost] like almost all unmanned aerial systems, of course, has optics.
