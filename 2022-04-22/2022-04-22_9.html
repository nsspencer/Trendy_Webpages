     Summary: The husband of Sherri Papini, a California woman who admitted to making up a 2016 abduction that touched off a nationwide search, filed for divorce and emergency custody of the couple’s two children, according to court documents obtained Friday.

Sherri Papini has not offered an explanation for the fabricated kidnapping plot, which involved two Hispanic women who she claimed held her at gunpoint and branded her.

Keith Papini stated he doesn't want to say anything in the pleadings that "would inflame the situation or attract media attention."
Pending a May hearing, a judge said Sherri Papini can have telephone and video calls with the children and that Keith Papini can supervise those calls.

     Sherri Papini's Husband Files for Divorce as New Details In Case Get Revealed by 'Dateline'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shasta County Sheriff Sergeant Kyle Wallace tells Dateline NBC that it was ultimately, probably, Papini's "theatrics" that led investigators to question her story and pursue the case against her.
She told investigators she had pulled out her own hair while being abducted at gunpoint to leave as a clue for her husband — which in and of itself struck investigators as odd.
On Wednesday, Keith Papini filed for divorce from Sherri in Shasta County Superior Court, as the Sacramento Bee first reported.
Shasta County Sheriff Michael L. Johnson sounded fully done with the case, and Sherri, in recent comments to the US Sun.
