You find your movie boring?
I hate “The Witch,” but that’s another story.
I mean, I think it’s a horror movie, but I can understand how people looking for a certain formula weren’t satisfied.
You want something to be familiar enough that people can get it, but different enough that it’s something new, and I think that’s what everyone was after with this film.

     Review: 'The Northman' Deserves More Than Cult Classic Status
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a recent interview, the director Robert Eggers reflected on the experience of helming his first potential blockbuster.
The Northman, out now, is, he said, "literally an epic” in that it adapts an Icelandic revenge saga, and in that it cost more than $70 million.
This budget allowed him to indulge in glitzy cinematic extravagance: The studio built him three whole villages and numerous viking ships.
As such, The Northman, then, is more gore than Thor, an arty offering that’ll likely attain cult classic status before it gets boffo box office.
He can see his father, the king, played by Ethan Hawke, returning with his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang).

     The True Story Behind The Northman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Not everybody who lived in the Viking Age was a Viking,” Price, the author of Children of Ash and Elm: A History of the Vikings, a definitive account of the Viking Age, told TIME.
This film will hopefully push people to think differently about the Vikings beyond the usual clichés.”It’s true: The Northman, in theaters April 22, is not your usual horned helmet fare.
With The Northman, Eggers hit a new level in his quest for historical truth, striving to perfect even the smallest details in the film, which he co-wrote with Icelandic novelist and poet Sjón.
“The assumption is that [the story of Amleth is] based on something very old, certainly in the Viking Age,” Price said.
The Northman doesn’t give much context as to why Amleth must find this particular sword beyond it being his fate.

     The History Behind Robert Eggers’ ‘The Northman’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As fire burns and a battle rages below a volcano, director Robert Eggers’ tightly packed world falls away into nothing but smoke and blood.
Cold landscapes, fantastical visions, riotous colors and violence work in tandem to conjure the Viking world.
In an email, he says, “The people of the Viking Age inhabited an organic story-world in which tales changed in the telling.
Even in a fictional story like The Northman, the Viking age comes across as an era that was fundamentally human and messy.
But as we discuss in our recent book, the medieval European past generally and the Viking age specifically were places both strange and familiar.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's a different kind of Shakespherean adaptation than one of the most famous of this genre: Stephen Spielberg's " West Side Story ."
Where "The Northman" elides Shakespeare's text, "West Side Story" is a refraction of adaptations.
And scholars like me love Shakespherean adaptations because they show the wild ways literature moves through history.
The joys of Shakespherean adaptations come in tracking down and mapping out the complex, centuries-long literary histories behind them.
Shakespherean adaptations call us beyond expressions of personal taste into understandings of how we got here.

     Summary: The first challenge of The Northman is that no historical advisor can give Robert that level of detail for the Viking Age.
There’s a banquet scene early on, and we don’t know what Viking tables looked like.
We don’t know what they did, but they wrote all over the walls.
We don’t know what that is but Robert decided, for his film, to make that the Tree of Kings.
It is invented because I don’t know what Valkyries’ helmets are like.

     Movie Review: Robert Eggers’s ‘The Northman’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But in this film, she’s practically demonic in that moment, a degenerate flying in the face of the particular Viking social order Amleth has dedicated himself to restoring.
The film is the third from writer-director Robert Eggers, who shares a screenplay credit here with the Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón.
The Northman doesn’t invite its viewers into its world, but instead dares them to try to catch up.
The Northman may be about the familiar motivation of revenge, but it’s even more remote in its belief system.
The Northman benefits from surrendering to that sense of remove, to its hero’s unforgiving understanding of the universe having been created to reward violence.
