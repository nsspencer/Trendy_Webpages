     WATCH LIVE: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene fights court challenge to her reelection
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Greene has repeatedly denied aiding or engaging in an insurrection and has filed a lawsuit alleging that the law the voters are using to challenge her eligibility is itself unconstitutional.
The secretary of state then has to request a hearing before an administrative law judge.
After the hearing, the administrative law judge is to present his findings to Raffensperger, who then must determine whether Greene is qualified.
U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg in Atlanta on Monday declined a request from Greene to halt the challenge process while the lawsuit plays out.
Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments in the litigation early next month, two weeks before Cawthorn’s primary election.

     Marjorie Taylor Greene appears in court over attempt to bar her from Congress
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared in court in Georgia on Friday for a hearing in an attempt to bar her from Congress for aiding the insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.
Ron Fein, for the challengers, said: “The most powerful witness against Marjorie Taylor Greene’s candidacy … is Marjorie Taylor Greene herself.”Greene, who testified, is set to appear on the Republican ballot for Georgia’s 24 May primary and has been endorsed by Donald Trump.
The day before the insurrection, Greene posted: “It’s our 1776 moment!” on the conservative-friendly Parler platform.
“The most powerful witness against Marjorie Taylor Greene’s candidacy … the most powerful witness in establishing that she crossed the line into engagement in insurrection is Marjorie Taylor Greene herself,” Fein said.
Celli asked the court “to acknowledge that this is an adverse witness” and said: “Ms Greene, I’m just asking questions.”“I’m just answering,” Greene said.

     Watch Live: Marjorie Taylor Greene testifies against challenge to her candidacy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is testifying in court Friday in an administrative hearing on a challenge seeking to block her from the ballot in Georgia based on a post-Civil War era policy about keeping insurrectionists from office.
Asked repeatedly if she knew of certain groups planning demonstrations on January 6, 2021, Greene responded, "I don't recall."
Greene also repeatedly said she didn't remember if she talked to other members of Congress or anyone in the White House about protests planned for that day.
Ron Fein, the attorney for the group of challengers, Free Speech for the People, said Friday that the "most powerful witness against Marjorie Taylor Greene's candidacy, in establishing she crossed a line, is Greene herself."
The administrative judge in Greene's case, Charles Beaudrot, will make a recommendation to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger about Greene's candidacy, and it will be up to him to decide whether to remove her from the ballot.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “You just don’t remember.”“I don’t remember," Greene replied.
The case against Greene was brought by Free Speech for People, a campaign-finance reform organization, on behalf of a group of voters from Greene’s district.
He accused Free Speech for People of trying to “hold against [Greene] First Amendment-protected speech” for her comments about the Jan. 6 attack.
Free Speech for People levied a similar case against Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.), but he successfully sued in federal court to block the proceedings.
Free Speech for People called two witnesses.
