     How Netflix’s Heartstopper Fits Into Alice Oseman’s Book Universe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix’s Heartstopper is a faithful adaptation of Alice Oseman’s web comics, doubtless thanks to the fact that Oseman herself adapted the series for screen.
If however, some viewers are inspired to go back into Oseman’s original books and comics, here’s how the fictional world fits together.
Oseman’s debut novel Solitaire is about Tori Spring, the older sister of Charlie who appears as a background character in Heartstopper, as played by Jenny Walser.
As Oseman makes clear on their website, Solitaire has an entirely different tone to Heartstopper and deals with difficult and mature topics.
There’s also a Heartstopper colouring book out, and a Yearbook containing bonus material coming out in hardback in October 2022.

     Heartstopper review – possibly the loveliest show on TV
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Heartstopper (Netflix) may not quite live up to the dramatic promise of its title, but this adorable teen romance is a heartwarmer, at the very least.
(There is much on-screen messaging in this, and watching characters write, delete, rewrite and re-delete their replies is tensely effective.)
Charlie’s friend Elle wonders if she has feelings for their other friend, Tao, and hearts appear in the air.
There are minor dramas among Charlie’s friends, but mostly it’s about Charlie and Nick.
But by the time I finish Heartstopper, I understand its appeal.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sarah is shown to be kind, if a bit oblivious throughout the season before finally supporting her son in one heartwarming scene at the end.
But it all came as a bit of a shock when Olivia Colman appeared on-screen to play the part!
Colman in particular sticks out in a series made mostly of newcomers.
Heartstopper also stars Yasmin Finney, William Gao, Corinna Brown, Kizzy Edgell, Cormac Hyde-Corrin, Sebastian Croft, Tobie Donovan, and Rhea Norwood.
All episodes of the first season of this charming, coming-of-age romance are up on Netflix right now.
