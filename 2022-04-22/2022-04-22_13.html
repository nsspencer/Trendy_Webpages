Seven years later and less one member, Real Lies return with the follow-up.
"Each song from Lad Ash is a farewell to something," the group told Crack, "but also about finding solace in what you’re left with and excitement in something new.
But I wanted to confront it head-on, show the distance between then and now."

     Pusha-T Gets Personal About Former Clipse Manager in New Song “Brambleton”
    </h2>

     Summary: The sonic rewards were plentiful on Friday thanks to the release of the long-awaited new album from Pusha-T, It’s Almost Dry.
I was hurt watching that,” he said, referencing a DJ Vlad-shared interview with former Clipse manager Anthony “Geezy” Gonzalez.
A key element of Geezy’s Vlad discussions was the 2013 My Name Is My Name cut “S.N.I.T.C.H.,” also produced by Pharrell.
Further addressing the memories tied into the title of the Dry song in question, Pusha-T revealed to Charlamagne this month he still drives through the area “all the time” when taking the scenic route.
In Pusha-T’s own words, the album was made “entirely with the greatest producers of all time,” i.e.

     Summary: British singer singer Labrinth — known for his work on HBO’s Euphoria — and Malice, Pusha’s brother and Clipse bandmate, also feature on the record.
Rolling Stone called the album a “well-balanced portrait of a complex man with some serious burdens on his heart.”“I’m always creating a masterpiece,” Pusha told Rolling Stone in a recent interview.
He also put McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish sandwich on blast in a viral diss track for fast food chain Arby’s.
Pusha will tour in support of It’s Almost Dry this summer, which includes a stop at San Francisco’s Outside Lands.
The tour kicks off May 29 in Seattle and wraps June 23 in Philadelphia.

     Pusha T’s ‘It’s Almost Dry’ Again Makes the Case That Things Go Better With Coke: Album Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four years after releasing “Daytona,” Pusha T has resurfaced with “It’s Almost Dry,” a 12-song collection of coke raps… and not much else.
It’s a disappointing conclusion considering the married father presumably has so much more hard-earned wisdom to offer his fans.
While sonically much more cohesive than its chaotic predecessor, Pusha fails to push himself into new territories, making the entire album feel safe, rather than an attempt at growth.
It’s these personal insights that feel glaringly absent from the album and could’ve added some substance to the monotonous subject matter.
The production continues to be equally split between Ye and Pharrell throughout.

     Premature Evaluation: Pusha T It’s Almost Dry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Once upon a time, the alliance between Pusha T and Kanye West made perfect sense.
Kanye West, meanwhile, got to take on some credibility from teaming up with a certified rap monster whose aesthetic aligned with his own.
Music, Pusha struck a balance between the cold, calculated precision of Clipse’s classic mid-’00s mixtapes and the demands of an evolving market.
For It’s Almost Dry, Pusha worked closely with both Kanye and Pharrell, playing them off of each other and pushing them to outdo each other.
At the very end of It’s Almost Dry, Pusha’s big brother shows up to throw those moments of darkness into stark relief.
