     Via Southern Ukraine, Russia Eyes “Another Route” to Moldova’s Transnistria
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian and Transnistrian soldiers march together on May 9, 2016, on the streets during a military ceremony held in Tiraspol, the breakaway region of Transnistria.
By establishing control over southern Ukraine, Russia will secure “another route” to Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria, where Russian troops have been based since the collapse of the Soviet Union, a senior Russian military commander was quoted as saying on Friday.
“Control over southern Ukraine is another route to Transnistria, where there is also evidence that the Russian-speaking population is being oppressed,” Russian news agency TASS quoted Major General Rustam Minnekayev as saying.
By seizing parts of southern Ukraine, Russia wants a land corridor between Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine where Russian forces are now concentrating their efforts.
Russia has had around 2,000 soldiers in Transnistria since 1992.

     Summary: As Russian troops tighten their grip on the strategic port town of Mariupol, their strategy is finally becoming clear.
“One of the tasks of the Russian army is to establish full control over the Donbas and southern Ukraine.
In reality, Russian speakers have been struck down in the hundreds in eastern Ukraine during the brutal invasion.
The refocusing of troops from northern Ukraine to the southern regions of the country has further choked Mariupol, where Ukrainian troops and civilians are holed up in a steel factory surrounded by Russian troops.
Several female bodies in mass graves show evidence of horrific crimes as well.

     Russia Targets Moldova Invasion Next as They Seek Land Corridor via Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A top Russian general has raised the prospect that a breakaway Moscow-aligned part of Moldova is next in the Kremlin's sights in its invasion of Ukraine.
Its economy is propped up by Moscow and Russian troops are stationed there.
Before his invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of pursuing "genocide" of the Russian-speaking population in the eastern Donbas region.
There have been concerns about the consequences that Russia's invasion of Ukraine might have for its neighbors.
Ukraine fears the existing presence of Russian troops in Transnistria, who number about 1,500, could open another front in the war.

     Russia threatens Moldova after Ukraine in dramatic expansion of Putin’s war objectives
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia has raised the prospect of an invasion of Moldova if Vladimir Putin succeeds in his military objectives in neighbouring Ukraine.
One of Russia’s leading military figures said the Kremlin’s plan is to dramatically expand its assault in the Donbas region across southern Ukraine to provide land corridors to Crimea and Moldova.
Mr Putin has long held the ambition of retaking control of states that were, until the fall of the Berlin Wall at the end of 1989, part of the Soviet Union.
If Mr Putin attempts to take the Nato-member Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania the West, including the US and UK, would be dragged into a war with Russia.
As the battle for Mariupol has shown, Russian forces have struggled to take cities during its eastern assault.

     Why Russia Would Want To Capture Land Leading To Moldova’s Transnistria
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Transnistria, an autonomous sliver of land located along much of Moldova’s eastern border with Ukraine, is well over 100 miles west of the front line in southern Ukraine.
Much like the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, Transnistria has a majority Russian-speaking population and has declared independence, though it has largely avoided the violence that’s plagued eastern Ukraine since two states declared independence there in 2014.
What To Watch ForOdesa is the largest city in southern Ukraine, and the third-largest in the country overall.
That’s how many Ukrainians have fled to Moldova since the Russian invasion started in February, according to the United Nations.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday Russia had started its new offensive in eastern Ukraine, which has included intense bombardment of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city.
