     Tyson Fury’s U.K. Boxing Homecoming Is Already Rocked
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s clear that the undefeated heavyweight champion Tyson Fury would prefer that his match Saturday against Dillian Whyte, a former sparring partner, be just about the boxing.
The match, at Wembley Stadium in London, will be Fury’s first in Britain in four years after a succession of fights in the United States.
And for this homecoming, he faces off against a friendly, if hard-punching, rival.
But the sideshow in boxing matches has often garnered as much attention as the fight, and this one is no exception.
As the fighters stood nose-to-nose for a photo opportunity, Fury’s father and a member of Whyte’s entourage began mouthing off to one another.

     Slimmed-down Tyson Fury weighs in over 11 pounds heavier than challenger Dillian Whyte
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON -- Tyson Fury sauntered to the scale to Gala's "Freed from Desire," and was greeted by a raucous crowd of Englishmen who welcomed The Gypsy King on Friday ahead of his first-ever title fight on British soil.
Dillian Whyte, who will challenge Fury on Saturday before 94,000-plus at Wembley Stadium (2 p.m.
ET, ESPN+ pay-per-view) in just the third all-British heavyweight title fight in the division's 130-year-plus history, checked in at 253.25 pounds.
In ESPN's 2021 Fight of the Year, an 11th-round KO of Wilder in a hellacious slugfest, Fury weighed a career-high 277 pounds.
If Fury (31-0-1, 22 KOs) emerges victorious, he'll earn a career-high $33,640,500 (a $4,102,500 win bonus is on the line.)

     Tyson Fury is rightly wary but Dillian Whyte win would be a seismic shock
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tyson Fury and Dillian Whyte will enter the ring at Wembley Stadium just after 10pm on Saturday night with mutual respect for each other and the brutal uncertainties of heavyweight boxing.
I know Tyson is the best heavyweight out there but I have been through so much to get this fight.
The acute loneliness of heavyweight boxing engulfed Whyte after he was knocked out in the fifth round by a sickening uppercut.
That’s the great thing about sport and especially heavyweight boxing.
For all the enduring unpredictability of some heavyweight contests, and the volatile lives of both men, Fury should win again.
