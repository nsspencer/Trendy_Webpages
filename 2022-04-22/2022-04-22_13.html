     Daryle Lamonica, Hard-Throwing Quarterback, Is Dead at 80
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Daryle Lamonica, the quarterback known as the Mad Bomber for his powerful arm, which led the Oakland Raiders to a berth in Super Bowl II, died on Thursday at his home in Fresno, Calif.
His son Brandon said that he died in his sleep.
He said that he did not know the cause, but that his father had not been in ill health.
Lamonica became one of pro football’s leading passers in the late 1960s and early ’70s.
But initially, after playing for three seasons with mediocre Notre Dame teams, he hardly seemed destined for an outstanding pro career.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Daryle Lamonica, a former quarterback for Notre Dame, the Bills and Raiders, died Thursday, the Associated Press first reported.
In the AFL, he won a pair of MVP awards with the Raiders in 1967 and ’69, and was the AFL championship game MVP in ’67.
As his playing time began to slide in 1973, he eventually gave way to fellow Raiders great Ken Stabler.
After a final NFL season in ’74, he played one year in the upstart World Football League for the Southern California Sun.
An avid outdoorsman, Lamonica also hosted a fishing show, Outdoors With the Pros, for Fox Sports Net.

Lamonica broke out through the air in his first season as a full-time starter in 1967, leading the Raiders to a 13-1 record, AFL West title and a berth in Super Bowl II.
Stabler went on lead the Raiders to their first Super Bowl title in 1976 and eventually was enshrined in Canton.
