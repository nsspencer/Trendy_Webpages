     Verstappen tops Leclerc while Hamilton caught out in F1 Imola qualifying
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: IMOLA, Italy — Formula One champion Max Verstappen earned his first pole position of the F1 season after an incident-packed session Friday, beating Charles Leclerc while Lewis Hamilton was caught out in qualifying for the sprint race at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.
There were five red flags in qualifying, including three in the final Q3 round on a rain-sodden day at Imola.
The last red flag cut qualifying short with Red Bull driver Verstappen 0.779 seconds ahead of series leader Charles Leclerc in his Ferrari and 1.132 ahead of McLaren’s Lando Norris.
There was also more disappointment for Mercedes after Lewis Hamilton and Russell went out in Q2, too.
Qualifying was also stopped with three minutes remaining following an incident for Bottas as Verstappen went quickest.

     Unhappy Leclerc rues run choices in Imola F1 qualifying
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Imola track drying out, it was clear that the fastest laps of the session would likely come at the very end.
After an early banker lap, Leclerc elected to back off for a cool down lap to recharge his battery and prepare tyres for a later effort rather than push on for a second attempt.
Reflecting on how qualifying had progressed, Leclerc said: “It was all about putting the laps in and waiting for Q3 to put everything together.
“This is why it's even more frustrating for me, because when it counts in Q3, I did the wrong choice.
We'll learn from it and, at the end, P2 is not a disaster.”PLUS: Can Ferrari maintain its F1 title push?

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Verstappen was one of the first cars through there, and duly completed his lap to secure a session-topping time.
He makes clear there is a big distinction between how drivers must behave when there is a double yellow and what happens when there is a single yellow.
Had the double yellow flags been put out for Bottas' incident, then Verstappen would have had no choice but to abandon his lap.
With just a single warning flag out, the FIA demands: "Drivers should reduce their speed and be prepared to change direction.
In Verstappen's case, it is obvious from the onboard footage of his pole lap that he duly took the right action.

     Max Verstappen beats rain and Leclerc to take F1 Imola GP sprint race pole
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By its close Red Bull’s Max Verstappen had earned “pole position” but such is the equally painful structuring of this format, while his pole counts statistically in the record books it is only for Saturday’s sprint race which will decide the literal pole for Sunday’s GP.
Photograph: Dan Istitene/Formula 1/Getty Images“It was a hectic, long qualifying,” said Verstappen, who was nonetheless pleased F1 was racing at Imola.
Saturday’s 21-lap sprint race will not only decide the grid for Sunday’s race but world championship points will also be awarded to the top eight finishers on a scale from eight to one.
The sprint race was trialled last year and the format has been tweaked but the most significant issue around it remains unsatisfactory.
This year F1 have decided that for statistical purposes the quickest driver on Friday will be deemed to have taken pole position but the sprint race will still decide the grid for Sunday’s grand prix.

    </h2>

     Summary: The 24-year-old Dutchman drove his Red Bull with care and aplomb to avoid problems on a day of frequent crashes and five red flags that left Ferrari’s championship leader frustrated.
Sergio Perez was seventh in the second Red Bull ahead of Valtteri Bottas of Alfa Romeo and four-time champion Sebastian Vettel of Aston Martin.
Sainz responded, going top, but Verstappen went faster before the Spaniard crashed to bring another red flag.
Out with Russell and Hamilton went Mick Schumacher of Haas, Zhou Guanyu of Alfa Romeo and Stroll.
The third qualifying session started with nine cars out quickly -- Sainz was unable to take part -- in tricky conditions.
