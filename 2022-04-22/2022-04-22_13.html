     Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene deflects in court hearing testimony about Jan. 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., on Friday repeatedly deflected questions about her involvement in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, and efforts by former President Donald Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
Greene testified under oath for nearly four hours as a witness during the hearing, as challengers make their case against her eligibility to run for re-election.
Greene was asked numerous questions about if she had any connection to the events that occurred on Jan. 6, 2021, and in the days leading up to the riot.
Asked when she first became aware that there would be a large demonstration on that day, Greene said, "I don't recall."
Greene's attorney, James Bopp, dismissed the day's events as a "political show trial."

     Summary: But Ron Fein, a lawyer for the voters who filed the challenge, said Greene took an oath and then broke it by engaging in an insurrection.
Administrative Law Judge Charles Beaudrot sometimes seemed exasperated by repeated rephrasing of questions and at times told Celli to move on.
Dozens of Greene supporters attended the hearing, including U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and staunch Greene ally.
The secretary of state then has to request a hearing before an administrative law judge.
U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg in Atlanta on Monday declined a request from Greene to halt the challenge process.

     Summary: Greene says the challenge to her candidacy is a lie and a scam designed to take away her constituents' rights to vote for the candidate of their choice.
Similar challenges elsewhereA similar challenge to Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn's candidacy was tossed out by a judge in North Carolina.
Greene asked a federal court to dismiss her challenge, but the judge let the case proceed.
Page Pate, a trial attorney in Georgia, said that disqualifying Greene from the ballot might not be the challengers' only goal.
Nancy Hollandchad, a longtime volunteer with Paulding County Republican Women, says efforts to take on Greene only embolden her supporters.

     Summary: CNN —Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia was confronted in court on Friday over past social media posts advocating violence against Democrats.
At the hearing, Greene initially denied she had called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “a traitor to our country,” as CNN’s KFile reported.
Greene eventually admitted to having said that about Pelosi as the attorney questioning the congresswoman put up the exhibit with her remarks.
She’s guilty of treason,” Greene says in the 2019 video, which she posted on Facebook at the time, before the video was removed.
“I don’t recall,” Greene said.

     4 answers from Marjorie Taylor Greene's testimony about Jan. 6 that invite scrutiny
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the hearing did afford the public our first sworn testimony from a member of Congress about Jan. 6, 2021.
Greene was combative, evasive and, like many witnesses in such a position, repeatedly responded to questions by saying she didn’t recall.
But a few answers stand out, either because Greene’s responses didn’t make much sense, or because they’re likely to be revisited in the future.
It’s hypothetical.”Question to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene: "In fact, you think that Speaker Pelosi is a traitor to the country, right?"
AdvertisementIt seems unlikely that anything established in the testimony would clear the legal bar of proving Greene incited the insurrection.
