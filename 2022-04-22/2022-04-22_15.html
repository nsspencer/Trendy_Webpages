     Summary: British singer singer Labrinth — known for his work on HBO’s Euphoria — and Malice, Pusha’s brother and Clipse bandmate, also feature on the record.
Rolling Stone called the album a “well-balanced portrait of a complex man with some serious burdens on his heart.”“I’m always creating a masterpiece,” Pusha told Rolling Stone in a recent interview.
He also put McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish sandwich on blast in a viral diss track for fast food chain Arby’s.

     Pusha T Is More Stagnant Than Consistent With His Coke Raps On ‘It’s Almost Dry’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pusha T Is More Stagnant Than Consistent With His Coke Raps On ‘It’s Almost Dry’ Jayson Buford Jayson Buford is a Brooklyn based music journalist seen in…More stagnant than it is consistent, It’s Almost Dry is a testament to Pusha T becoming too impressed with his own mythology.
“Didn’t have to reinvent the wheel, just a better design,” Pusha T raps on “Dreamin’ of the Past,” the third track off his new album, It’s Almost Dry.
Like that line, Push says his raps with glee and an experienced jubilance of a man who can’t wait to tell you the crimes he committed the week prior.
At least Push isn’t calling out other rappers for their authenticity and contract issues this time.
But just because Push’s music comes from the seeds of realism and delirious sacrosanctity of ‘90s coke rap, that doesn’t mean that it’s less derivative.

     Pusha T’s ‘It’s Almost Dry’ Again Makes the Case That Things Go Better With Coke: Album Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four years after releasing “Daytona,” Pusha T has resurfaced with “It’s Almost Dry,” a 12-song collection of coke raps… and not much else.
It’s a disappointing conclusion considering the married father presumably has so much more hard-earned wisdom to offer his fans.
While sonically much more cohesive than its chaotic predecessor, Pusha fails to push himself into new territories, making the entire album feel safe, rather than an attempt at growth.
It’s these personal insights that feel glaringly absent from the album and could’ve added some substance to the monotonous subject matter.
The production continues to be equally split between Ye and Pharrell throughout.

     Premature Evaluation: Pusha T It’s Almost Dry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Once upon a time, the alliance between Pusha T and Kanye West made perfect sense.
Kanye West, meanwhile, got to take on some credibility from teaming up with a certified rap monster whose aesthetic aligned with his own.
Music, Pusha struck a balance between the cold, calculated precision of Clipse’s classic mid-’00s mixtapes and the demands of an evolving market.
For It’s Almost Dry, Pusha worked closely with both Kanye and Pharrell, playing them off of each other and pushing them to outdo each other.
At the very end of It’s Almost Dry, Pusha’s big brother shows up to throw those moments of darkness into stark relief.
