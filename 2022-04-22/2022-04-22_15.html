     Via Southern Ukraine, Russia Eyes “Another Route” to Moldova’s Transnistria
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian and Transnistrian soldiers march together on May 9, 2016, on the streets during a military ceremony held in Tiraspol, the breakaway region of Transnistria.
By establishing control over southern Ukraine, Russia will secure “another route” to Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria, where Russian troops have been based since the collapse of the Soviet Union, a senior Russian military commander was quoted as saying on Friday.
“Control over southern Ukraine is another route to Transnistria, where there is also evidence that the Russian-speaking population is being oppressed,” Russian news agency TASS quoted Major General Rustam Minnekayev as saying.
By seizing parts of southern Ukraine, Russia wants a land corridor between Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine where Russian forces are now concentrating their efforts.
Russia has had around 2,000 soldiers in Transnistria since 1992.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 22 (Reuters) - Russia plans to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine during the second phase of what it calls its special military operation, the deputy commander of Russia's central military district said on Friday, Russian news agencies reported.
He was quoted as saying that Russia planned to forge a land corridor between Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula which it annexed in 2014, and Donbas in eastern Ukraine.
read moreMinnekayev was cited as saying by Russia's RIA news agency that media reports of Russian military setbacks were wide of the mark.
According to RIA, he also said that daily missile and other strikes against Ukrainian forces meant Russia could do serious damage without losing troops.
Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

     Russia Targets Moldova Invasion Next as They Seek Land Corridor via Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A top Russian general has raised the prospect that a breakaway Moscow-aligned part of Moldova is next in the Kremlin's sights in its invasion of Ukraine.
Its economy is propped up by Moscow and Russian troops are stationed there.
Before his invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of pursuing "genocide" of the Russian-speaking population in the eastern Donbas region.
There have been concerns about the consequences that Russia's invasion of Ukraine might have for its neighbors.
Ukraine fears the existing presence of Russian troops in Transnistria, who number about 1,500, could open another front in the war.

     Russia threatens Moldova after Ukraine in dramatic expansion of Putin’s war objectives
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia has raised the prospect of an invasion of Moldova if Vladimir Putin succeeds in his military objectives in neighbouring Ukraine.
One of Russia’s leading military figures said the Kremlin’s plan is to dramatically expand its assault in the Donbas region across southern Ukraine to provide land corridors to Crimea and Moldova.
Mr Putin has long held the ambition of retaking control of states that were, until the fall of the Berlin Wall at the end of 1989, part of the Soviet Union.
If Mr Putin attempts to take the Nato-member Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania the West, including the US and UK, would be dragged into a war with Russia.
As the battle for Mariupol has shown, Russian forces have struggled to take cities during its eastern assault.

     Why Russia Would Want To Capture Land Leading To Moldova’s Transnistria
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Transnistria, an autonomous sliver of land located along much of Moldova’s eastern border with Ukraine, is well over 100 miles west of the front line in southern Ukraine.
Much like the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, Transnistria has a majority Russian-speaking population and has declared independence, though it has largely avoided the violence that’s plagued eastern Ukraine since two states declared independence there in 2014.
What To Watch ForOdesa is the largest city in southern Ukraine, and the third-largest in the country overall.
That’s how many Ukrainians have fled to Moldova since the Russian invasion started in February, according to the United Nations.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday Russia had started its new offensive in eastern Ukraine, which has included intense bombardment of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city.

     Russian General Announces Plan to Invade Moldova after Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Russian general announced plans to occupy the Transnistria region of Moldova on Friday.
Such a corridor would also purport to connect the Russian mainland to Transnistria.
It is not internationally recognized by any country, including Russia, though nearly 1,500 Russian troops are stationed in the region and its trade is primarily conducted with the Russian mainland.
Ukraine’s armed forces had previously warned on April 2 that Russia was mobilizing troops in Transnistria, though this was initially denied by Moldova.
Russia’s occupation of Transnistria would expand the conflict with Ukraine to another European nation-state, since it began in late February of 2022.
