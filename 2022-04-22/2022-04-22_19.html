     US security package for Ukraine includes Phoenix Ghost drones - GPS World
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On April 21, the Pentagon announced an $800 million security package for Ukraine defense, including 121 tactical unmanned aerial systems (UAS) dubbed Phoenix Ghost drones.
The Ghost drones are manufactured by Aevex Aerospace and have similar capabilities to the single-use “kamikaze” Switchblade UAS from AeroVironment.
The U.S. is also sending at least 300 more Switchblade drones, according to CNBC, though which model has not been revealed.
AeroVironment is also donating more than 100 Quantix Recon UAS and operational training services to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence and territorial forces.
Delivery of the Quantix Recon UAS is independent of other AeroVironment tactical missile systems and UAS provided to Ukraine by the United States.

The new $800m assistance package includes a new unmanned aerial weapons system, or drone, dubbed the Phoenix Ghost.
Not much else is known about the Phoenix Ghost drones, including their range and precise capabilities.
Kirby, however, did say that the drones, which have not yet been delivered to Ukraine, are equipped with onboard cameras.
He added that the systems had been in development since before Russia’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine on February 24.

     Summary: U.S. Agrees to Make “Phoenix Ghost” Drone for Ukraine – A senior defense official told reporters on Thursday that as part of the latest $800 million aid package for Ukraine, the United States Air Force will provide a custom-designed drone for Ukraine named the Phoenix Ghost.
“The Phoenix Ghost is…this was rapidly developed by the Air Force in response, specifically, to Ukrainian requirements,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
We do know that the drone was developed quickly, but information about the specific features baked into the device at the request of Ukrainian military officials has not been revealed.
The United States will work with the Ukrainian military to ensure that all troops are up to speed with how to use the unmanned aerial system.
Ukrainian troops who were present in the United States before the outbreak of the war have been trained to use the Switchblades.

     How Phoenix Ghost Drones Will Help Ukraine Deliver 'Punch' to Russian Army
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington is sending mysterious Phoenix Ghost tactical drones developed by the U.S. Air Force to Ukraine as part of the latest $800 million arms package for the war-torn country.
On Thursday Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby, alongside a senior defense department official, outlined how the new drones will help Ukraine "deliver a punch" to the Russian army.
The Phoenix Ghost drones are likely, then, be able to directly crash into and destroy targets, and won't be recovered.
"We believed that this particular system would very nicely suit their needs, particularly in eastern Ukraine," Kirby told reporters.
The Phoenix Ghost tactical drones also have optical abilities that will assist in strikes against Russian forces, the Pentagon spokesman added.

The Phoenix Ghost drone is equipped with infrared sensors, allowing it to operate during night-time with great ease.
Kirby said the Phoenix Ghost drone has “optics” too and can take “sight pictures”.
The exact differences between the capabilities of the Aerovironment Switchblade and Phoenix Ghost drone are still unclear.
The White House has already announced that over 121 Phoenix Ghost drones would be dispatched to Ukraine to help the country combat Russian troops.

But the purpose is akin to the Switchblade,” Kirby said.
AdvertisementThe Phoenix Ghost drone was developed by AEVEX Aerospace based in Solana Beach, California, according to Breaking Defense.
While the Pentagon keeps saying the Phoenix Ghost is like the Switchblade, The Drive news outlet points out that doesn’t mean it necessarily is a tube-launched drone like the Switchblade.
Ukraine will receive precisely 121 Phoenix Ghost drone systems, according to the Pentagon.

And is it true that they were designed specially for the Ukrainian defense?
The Phoenix Ghost drone is “a different type of aircraft, it’s a one-way aircraft that is effective against medium armored ground targets,” retired Lt. Gen. David Deptula told Politico.
Other than that, we don’t yet have many details on the Phoenix Ghost.
And as for the name – well, even the senior defense official has no idea where that came from.

     Meet the Phoenix Ghost, a secretive new drone the U.S. fast-tracked for delivery to Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The United States has spent roughly $3.4 billion on sending military assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24.
The Phoenix Ghost, an unmanned aerial vehicle, was partly designed with Ukraine in mind, the Pentagon says.
Previously, a different Pentagon official had implied the Phoenix Ghost was created specifically for Ukraine, but Kirby walked back those comments, stating that the drone had been in development long before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion.
The Phoenix Ghost is similar to “switchblade” drones—also known as “kamikaze drones” or “loitering munitions”—the U.S. has already delivered to Ukraine in that it doesn’t fire on an enemy from a far distance.
“[The Phoenix Ghost] like almost all unmanned aerial systems, of course, has optics.
