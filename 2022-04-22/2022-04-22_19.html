     Summary: Madison Cawthorn apparently has a thing for donning lingerie.
Politico obtained photos that appear to show Cawthorn partying in racy attire and wearing hoop earrings.
It‚Äôs unclear when the photos were taken, but Politico notes that they appear to show Cawthorn sitting in a wheelchair, indicating they were taken after the 2014 accident that left him partially paralyzed.
Rep. Madison Cawthorn (@RepCawthorn): "You might amend a bill, but you'll never amend biology.

     Madison Cawthorn Appears to Party In Lingerie In Newly Unearthed Photos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementIt‚Äôs on that note that I‚Äôm quite confused to report newly unearthed photos of the freshman Congressman posing in lingerie, appearing to party and sip on white wine with a group of women.
In any case‚Äîamid the mystery of when these photos were taken, who provided them to Politico, and what happens next, one thing is clear: Someone‚Äîpresumably Cawthorn‚Äôs own party leadership‚Äîwants him out of office.
And it‚Äôs not hard to see why, in the wake of Cawthorn‚Äôs self-inflicted cocaine-and-orgy circus, sparking intense drama and backlash that‚Äôs clearly still unfolding.
Ever since Cawthorn‚Äôs bizarre claims made on a conservative podcast last month, House Republicans have called on Cawthorn to name names.
One of the senators representing his state of North Carolina called him an ‚Äúembarrassment,‚Äù while the other endorsed one of Cawthorn‚Äôs opponents.

     Rep. Madison Cawthorn: Lingerie Party Pics Were From A 'Goofy' Game On A Cruise
    </h2>

     Summary: However, the website admitted it was still unclear exactly when the photos were taken.
In a tweet posted after the article went live, Cawthorn said the pictures were just ‚Äúgoofy vacation photos during a game on a cruise‚Äù that he says ‚Äúwere taken waaay before I ran for Congress.‚ÄùAdvertisementI guess the left thinks goofy vacation photos during a game on a cruise (taken waaay before I ran for Congress) is going to somehow hurt me?
There's nothing wrong with wearing lingerie, there's something very wrong with promoting the persecution of trans and gender non-conforming Americans.
