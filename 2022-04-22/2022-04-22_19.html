     Summary: The last time Pusha-T dropped a full-length project, Complex named him the Best Rapper Alive, and ranked it as the No.
1 album of the year.
Last month, he told us that his follow-up, It’s Almost Dry, is even better than 2018’s DAYTONA.
Or was Push telling the truth and this album really is better than DAYTONA?
Members of the Complex Music team—Andre Gee, Jessica McKinney, and Jordan Rose—shared their first impressions after giving this thing a few spins.

     Kanye vs Pharrell: Who Has the Best Beats on Pusha T’s New Album?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As one of raps most premier lyricists, Pusha T can glide over production from almost anyone.
Pusha T and Pharrell’s relationship extends back the furthest: Along with Chad Hugo, the three Virginia natives met in high school.
And Pusha T’s last album, 2018’s Daytona, was produced entirely by Kanye to plenty of critical acclaim.
Both Kanye and Pharrell bring about truly inspired, euphoric moments throughout the album.
“See Pharrell was focused more on compositions (song structure, call outs, flow patterns) on his portion of the album.

     The Story Behind Pusha T’s Emotionally Charged Album Intro
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One rap-world rule of thumb: You never want to be the subject of a Pusha T song.
Listeners get to hear that side of him right from the outset of It’s Almost Dry, the rapper’s brand new fourth studio album.
Gonzalez, who Pusha has shouted out on past tracks like “So Appalled,” posited that “95 percent” of Pusha and his brother Malice’s raps about selling cocaine were inspired by his own activity in the Virginia drug trade.
It’s a heavy claim to levy, since Pusha has basically built his entire career applying his caustic wit to stories of dope deals.
In his DJ Vlad interview, Gonzalez claimed that he spoke to the FBI and ATF because those organizations threatened to indict his mother, wife, sister, and aunt if he did not cooperate.

I was hurt watching that,” he said, referencing a DJ Vlad-shared interview with former Clipse manager Anthony “Geezy” Gonzalez.
A key element of Geezy’s Vlad discussions was the 2013 My Name Is My Name cut “S.N.I.T.C.H.,” also produced by Pharrell.
Further addressing the memories tied into the title of the Dry song in question, Pusha-T revealed to Charlamagne this month he still drives through the area “all the time” when taking the scenic route.
In Pusha-T’s own words, the album was made “entirely with the greatest producers of all time,” i.e.

King Push was asked about a Jack Harlow and Drake collaboration that leaked earlier in April, which found the 6 God subliminally sending shots in Pusha’s direction.
“I even heard that and it sounds old to me,” Pusha T said around the 14-minute mark.
“Like, the flows sound old.
It’s like, bro, after what I’ve done, like ‘the middleman’ talk and all that type of talk — that’s not scathing for me.

     Pusha T’s ‘It’s Almost Dry’ Again Makes the Case That Things Go Better With Coke: Album Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four years after releasing “Daytona,” Pusha T has resurfaced with “It’s Almost Dry,” a 12-song collection of coke raps… and not much else.
It’s a disappointing conclusion considering the married father presumably has so much more hard-earned wisdom to offer his fans.
While sonically much more cohesive than its chaotic predecessor, Pusha fails to push himself into new territories, making the entire album feel safe, rather than an attempt at growth.
It’s these personal insights that feel glaringly absent from the album and could’ve added some substance to the monotonous subject matter.
The production continues to be equally split between Ye and Pharrell throughout.

     Premature Evaluation: Pusha T It’s Almost Dry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Once upon a time, the alliance between Pusha T and Kanye West made perfect sense.
Kanye West, meanwhile, got to take on some credibility from teaming up with a certified rap monster whose aesthetic aligned with his own.
Music, Pusha struck a balance between the cold, calculated precision of Clipse’s classic mid-’00s mixtapes and the demands of an evolving market.
For It’s Almost Dry, Pusha worked closely with both Kanye and Pharrell, playing them off of each other and pushing them to outdo each other.
At the very end of It’s Almost Dry, Pusha’s big brother shows up to throw those moments of darkness into stark relief.
