     How weather impacts Thunder Over Louisville – 89.3 WFPL News Louisville
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Weather obviously plays an important role in Thunder Over Louisville and thankfully, Saturday’s forecast is sunny and warm.
But WAVE 3 Meteorologist Tawana Andrew said of the 30 full Thunder shows since 1990, rain has fallen on half of them.
Andrew said rain doesn’t really affect the aircraft but clouds sure can.
Andrew said if the wind is too strong it limits which runway aircraft can use.
