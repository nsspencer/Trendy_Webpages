     Suspect in Sniper-Style Shooting in Washington Kills Himself, Police Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During an earlier news conference, the police said they were searching for a “person of interest,” Raymond Spencer, 23, of Fairfax, Va., whom they wanted to question.
Mr. Spencer’s name emerged “based upon the things we have seen on social media,” said Stuart Emerman, assistant chief of the Metropolitan Police Department.
Later in the night, Chief Contee said he would not release the name of the deceased suspect until the family was notified.
Chief Contee said the investigation was ongoing.
Possible video of the attack circulated online and depicted bursts of rapid gunfire from an elevated location.

     At least 4 shot in Northwest Washington, D.C. neighborhood; suspect later took own life
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michael Balsamo and Carole FeldmanAssociated PressWASHINGTON — Police and federal agents swarmed into a northwest Washington neighborhood on Friday after at least four people were shot in a flurry of gunfire.
The law enforcement officers responded to the scene near Connecticut Avenue and Van Ness St. in the Van Ness neighborhood of Washington shortly before 3:30 p.m.
Residents in surrounding neighborhoods had been asked to shelter in place as officers went door-to-door.
"We believe that the suspect took his own life as MPD members were entering or breaching the apartment where the suspect was located," Contee said at a briefing Friday night.
Police were questioning witnesses at the scene and were still trying to discern a motive for the shooting, Emerman said.
