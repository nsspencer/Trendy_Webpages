     Jack Nicholson Wanted His Joker to Scare Kids — Because He Knew They’d Like the Feeling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jack Nicholson knew immediately how he was going to play the Joker in Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman; it was going to be the only way the film would have been taken seriously.
I didn’t want this to go through the normal, ‘Let’s brighten it up for the kids,'” Nicholson said previously.
“It changed the nature of the ‘comic’ framework into a film — from a movie into a film with the inclusion of Jack Nicholson,” Guber said.
And he knew kids would respond to a darker version of the character.
“My early experience in working for an audience full of children: the more you scare them, the more they like it,” Nicholson said devilishly.

     Summary: Included with its arrival is a deleted scene of Barry Keoghan’s blurred out Joker, teasing the Clown Prince of Gotham’s inevitable return.
Yet, all of those versions owe some thanks to Jack Nicholson’s sinister transformation of The Joker in 1989's Batman.
AdvertisementIn a video that was recently resurfaced by The Hollywood Reporter, Jack Nicholson explained how he went about forming his menacing version of the Joker in Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman.
I didn’t want this to go through the normal, ‘Let’s brighten it up for the kids,’” Nicholson says in the behind-the-scenes featurette.
“It changed the nature of the ‘comic’ framework into a film—from a movie into a film with the inclusion of Jack Nicholson,” Guber said.

     ‘The Shining’ prop axe Jack Nicholson used up for auction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The axe is one of several Nicholson used during the filming of the Stanley Kubrick chiller.
If the axe is too pricey, the auction house has another “Shining” prop up for grabs.
A different foam axe sold for $57,600, while a wooden axe went for $211,000, Forbes reports.
One person who has famously hated the film is King himself, who found it emotionally cold and too different from his book.
King loved “Doctor Sleep” so much he said it even warmed his feelings toward its predecessor.

     Jack Nicholson’s 15 Best Performances Ranked, From ‘Batman’ to ‘Cuckoo’s Nest’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the best actors of his generation, Jack Nicholson built a prolific career of rich, dynamic, emotionally complex and often terrifying performances.
His first Oscar win came for Milos Forman’s “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” (1975), which is one of three movies to win the “Oscar Big Five” (picture, director, actor, actress and screenplay).
More specifically, with eight nominations for lead actor he’s tied for second alongside Paul Newman and Peter O’Toole, and behind Laurence Olivier and Spencer Tracy.
With 10 films nominated for best picture throughout his career, he’s currently tied in second place for the most credited appearances in the Academy’s top category alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.
Aside from the rumors that he would star in an American remake of the international feature “Toni Erdmann,” there’s been no sign of a new Nicholson role on the horizon.

     Summary: Born on April 22, 1937, in Neptune, New Jersey, the future Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson was raised by Ethel May and John Nicholson, alongside his older sister, June.
Nearly 40 years later, in 1985, Nicholson's world would be turned upside down when he learned from a TIME magazine reporter that his mother, Ethel, was actually his grandmother, and that his sister June had actually given birth to him as a teenager.
