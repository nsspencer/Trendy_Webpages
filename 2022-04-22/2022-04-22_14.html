     Summary: I didn’t expect a boring pilgrim horror movie to be successful, that’s for sure.
You find your movie boring?
I hate “The Witch,” but that’s another story.
I mean, I think it’s a horror movie, but I can understand how people looking for a certain formula weren’t satisfied.
You want something to be familiar enough that people can get it, but different enough that it’s something new, and I think that’s what everyone was after with this film.

     Björk Plays a Witchy Seeress in Robert Eggers ‘The Northman’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Focus FeaturesThe Northman, Robert Eggers’s Icelandic Viking epic, is a harsh hero’s quest full of action and abs.
Despite the brevity of Björk’s moonlit moment, The Northman wouldn’t be complete without her.
“I was introduced to Björk by Robin Carolan, who’s one of the composers,” Eggers told GQ.
What The Northman may lack in Björk, it makes up for in stomach-churning fight sequences with lots of face smashing.
It might not be for everybody, but Björk’s two-minute ASMR seeress role play is any fan’s Valhalla.

     The History Behind Robert Eggers’ ‘The Northman’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As fire burns and a battle rages below a volcano, director Robert Eggers’ tightly packed world falls away into nothing but smoke and blood.
Cold landscapes, fantastical visions, riotous colors and violence work in tandem to conjure the Viking world.
In an email, he says, “The people of the Viking Age inhabited an organic story-world in which tales changed in the telling.
Even in a fictional story like The Northman, the Viking age comes across as an era that was fundamentally human and messy.
But as we discuss in our recent book, the medieval European past generally and the Viking age specifically were places both strange and familiar.

     The True Story Behind The Northman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Not everybody who lived in the Viking Age was a Viking,” Price, the author of Children of Ash and Elm: A History of the Vikings, a definitive account of the Viking Age, told TIME.
This film will hopefully push people to think differently about the Vikings beyond the usual clichés.”It’s true: The Northman, in theaters April 22, is not your usual horned helmet fare.
With The Northman, Eggers hit a new level in his quest for historical truth, striving to perfect even the smallest details in the film, which he co-wrote with Icelandic novelist and poet Sjón.
“The assumption is that [the story of Amleth is] based on something very old, certainly in the Viking Age,” Price said.
The Northman doesn’t give much context as to why Amleth must find this particular sword beyond it being his fate.
