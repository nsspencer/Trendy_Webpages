     What Kevin McCarthy Tape Says About Donald Trump: Full Audio Transcript
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MSNBC's Rachel Maddow aired an audio recording last night of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying he was considering calling then President Donald Trump and recommending he resign from office.
The report is based on Burns' and Martin's upcoming book This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America's Future.
McCarthy had issued a statement strongly denying the report and criticizing the newspaper before the audio was released.
A McCarthy spokesperson, Mark Bednar, had also issued a statement before the release of the audio on Thursday, saying: "McCarthy never said he'd call Trump to say he should resign."
At that time, Democrats were pushing hard to impeach Trump and McCarthy addressed the matter in his comments.

     Summary: Audio reveals Kevin McCarthy planned to urge Trump to resign after Capitol riotEnlarge this image toggle caption Samuel Corum/Getty Images Samuel Corum/Getty ImagesU.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had planned to get former President Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, The New York Times revealed in an audio recording Thursday.
McCarthy said he would alert the former president of his plans to begin an impeachment trial if he did not resign.
"I think this will pass, and that would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.
3 House Republican Liz Cheney can be heard asking McCarthy about whether a 25th amendment succession plan could be triggered and about Trump's possible resignation.
In January, the committee asked McCarthy to appear and share more about his interest to have Trump resign.

     Republican leader Kevin McCarthy considered urging Trump to quit, audio reveals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A new audio clip reveals that House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy considered asking Donald Trump to resign as president in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 Capitol insurrection.
Cheney asked McCarthy if he believed Trump would resign if Congress successfully passed a 25th amendment resolution, which would declare Trump incapable of holding office.
Although McConnell criticized Trump publicly for his role in the attack, he voted to acquit the former president in his impeachment trial.
He also said he would support Trump should Trump be the 2024 Republican nominee.
McCarthy, for his part, did a more complete about-face: he has claimed that Trump was unaware of the attack until McCarthy broke the news to him that it was happening.

     McCarthy said he would urge Trump to resign after Jan. 6, new audio reveals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just days after the Jan. 6 riot, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy told a fellow Republican lawmaker that he would recommend to then-President Donald Trump that he resign, according to audio of a call shared with MSNBC and aired Thursday night.
McCarthy, R-Calif., also indicated that he thought impeachment would succeed in the House and possibly the Senate.
“The only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign,” McCarthy said in audio that aired on "The Rachel Maddow Show."
McCarthy responds that he's "had a few discussions," adding that he was planning to call Trump later that night but was doubtful that Trump would "ever walk away."
Days later, McCarthy met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, seeking to repair their relationship.
