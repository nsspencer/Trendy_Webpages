     Summary: 12:27 p.m.Trump Jr. expected to engage with Jan. 6 committee — Donald Trump Jr. has agreed to meet soon with the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, a person familiar with the matter confirms.
The offer to voluntarily appear by the former president’s eldest son comes amid a raft of appearances from those who are closest to Trump, including his daughter Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner, and Donald Trump Jr.’s fiance Kimberly Guilfoyle.
Donald Trump Jr. sent text messages to then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows proposing strategies to overturn the results of the 2020 election and declare his father the winner.
“It’s very simple,” Donald Trump Jr. wrote to Meadows the day after the election, as reported by CNN.
In recent weeks, the committee has spoken with allies and officials in Trump’s immediate orbit.

     Summary: Audio reveals Kevin McCarthy planned to urge Trump to resign after Capitol riotEnlarge this image toggle caption Samuel Corum/Getty Images Samuel Corum/Getty ImagesU.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had planned to get former President Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, The New York Times revealed in an audio recording Thursday.
"I think this will pass, and that would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.
In January, the committee asked McCarthy to appear and share more about his interest to have Trump resign.
Tensions had been high between McCarthy and Trump on Jan. 6McCarthy and Trump had a shouting match during a phone call during the Jan. 6 attack, where McCarthy pleaded with Trump to take notice that the rioters were Trump supporters.
Days later, McCarthy took to the House floor later to say Trump "bears responsibility" for his role in the attack.

     Liz Cheney denies recording bombshell tape of Kevin McCarthy saying he would urge Trump to resign after Jan. 6 riot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Liz Cheney on Friday denied recording or leaking audio from a phone call that appears to show House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying he would tell then-President Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
"The only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said, according to the recording.
In it, McCarthy tells top House Republicans that Trump admitted he bears some responsibility for the Capitol riot.
The vast majority of House Republicans — who would vote on whether to make McCarthy speaker — have stayed loyal to Trump.
"The only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.

     Kevin McCarthy’s speakership hopes face new threat from Trump comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There were early indications that Trump aides were downplaying the impact of the new revelations on Trump and McCarthy’s relationship.
The Washington Post first reported on the conversation between McCarthy and Trump.
A spokesperson for Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who heads House Republicans’ campaign arm, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump still commands great sway over House Republicans and his reaction to McCarthy’s newly public comments could ripple across the caucus, as well as among the candidates likely to help Republicans take control of the House next year.
Joining Bannon, Trump associate Boris Epshteyn described the audio as “extremely hurtful to hopes that Kevin McCarthy has to become speaker.”“Kevin McCarthy’s got a big problem,” Epshteyn said.

     Kevin McCarthy Wanted Trump to Resign After January 6 and Then Lied About It
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a serial Trump brownnoser, also publicly decried Trump’s conduct at the time.
Now, I haven’t had a discussion with the Dems that if he did resign, would that happen?
Again, the only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass and it would be my recommendation you should resign.
McCarthy both having said he’d push Trump to resign and then getting caught lying about it nicely captures his weasel-like efforts to remain the leader of his caucus without offending Trump and his minions.
And he got on the horn with Trump as soon as his lie was exposed.
