     Summary: Audio reveals Kevin McCarthy planned to urge Trump to resign after Capitol riotEnlarge this image toggle caption Samuel Corum/Getty Images Samuel Corum/Getty ImagesU.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had planned to get former President Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, The New York Times revealed in an audio recording Thursday.
McCarthy said he would alert the former president of his plans to begin an impeachment trial if he did not resign.
"I think this will pass, and that would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.
3 House Republican Liz Cheney can be heard asking McCarthy about whether a 25th amendment succession plan could be triggered and about Trump's possible resignation.
In January, the committee asked McCarthy to appear and share more about his interest to have Trump resign.

     Republican Kevin McCarthy under fire after audio shows he discussed urging Trump to resign
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) speaks to the media on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 2, 2019.
U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of the few Republican politicians openly critical of Trump, blasted McCarthy on Twitter on Thursday night.
"Question for Kevin McCarthy ... how can you honestly feel ok with the lies?
"While I was rallying in Wyoming against Liz Cheney ... Kevin McCarthy was defending Liz Cheney among House Republicans ... you should have trusted my instincts, not your own," Gaetz said in a tweet.
McCarthy's fate will depend largely on Trump, who remains the most powerful figure in the Republican Party more than a year after he left office.

     Summary: And that could help McCarthy retain his standing atop the House GOP.
The two have enjoyed an occasionally rocky but ultimately mutually beneficial relationship since Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015.
And it was no secret to Trump that McCarthy had qualms about his behavior surrounding Jan. 6.
The larger question is, would it benefit Trump to publicly ditch McCarthy now?
A public break between the two men could inject new chaos into the party at a critical moment.

     Republican leader Kevin McCarthy considered urging Trump to quit, audio reveals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A new audio clip reveals that House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy considered asking Donald Trump to resign as president in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 Capitol insurrection.
Cheney asked McCarthy if he believed Trump would resign if Congress successfully passed a 25th amendment resolution, which would declare Trump incapable of holding office.
Although McConnell criticized Trump publicly for his role in the attack, he voted to acquit the former president in his impeachment trial.
He also said he would support Trump should Trump be the 2024 Republican nominee.
McCarthy, for his part, did a more complete about-face: he has claimed that Trump was unaware of the attack until McCarthy broke the news to him that it was happening.

     Summary: McCarthy responds that he's "had a few discussions," adding that he was planning to call Trump later that night but was doubtful that Trump would "ever walk away."
I think there’s a chance it’ll pass the Senate, even when he’s gone," McCarthy says, apparently referring to an impeachment resolution.
On Friday, CNN aired more audio obtained by the New York Times of a conference call that McCarthy held with House Republicans on Jan. 11, 2021.
McCarthy said he had spoken to Trump that day and Trump accepted some responsibility for the Jan. 6 attack.
Days later, McCarthy met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, seeking to repair their relationship.

     Liz Cheney denies recording bombshell tape of Kevin McCarthy saying he would urge Trump to resign after Jan. 6 riot

     Summary: Rep. Liz Cheney on Friday denied recording or leaking audio from a phone call that appears to show House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying he would tell then-President Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
Later Friday, news outlets aired a separate audio clip of McCarthy from Jan. 11, 2021.
In it, McCarthy tells top House Republicans that Trump admitted he bears some responsibility for the Capitol riot.
The vast majority of House Republicans — who would vote on whether to make McCarthy speaker — have stayed loyal to Trump.
Just 10 House Republicans voted for impeachment.
