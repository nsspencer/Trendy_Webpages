     Heat get brutal Kyle Lowry injury update in Game 3 vs. Hawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyle Lowry has been officially ruled out for the rest of Game 3 of the Miami Heat’s playoff series against the Atlanta Hawks because of a leg injury.
Lowry left in the third quarter with what the team said is a left leg injury.
Kyle Lowry (leg) out for the rest of Game 3, Heat say.
Still, Lowry’s injury has to be concerning for the Heat, especially since it’s unknown how he got the injury.
However, should the injury be serious and force Lowry to be sidelined, that won’t bode well for the team’s playoff aspirations.
