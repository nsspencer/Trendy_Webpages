     Summary: Playoff Bell Ringer standings:Joel Embiid - 2Tyrese Maxey - 1Put away those brooms, Sixers fans.
The biggest concern for the Sixers is obviously the health of Joel Embiid, who struggled at times during Saturday’s contest.
It wasn’t pretty, but the Sixers are still in the driver’s seat as the series heads back to the Wells Fargo Center.
Nevertheless, there were moments when his midrange game didn’t miss a beat, and he still played 39 minutes.
Hopefully his shooting improves as the Sixers look to avoid a Game 6.
