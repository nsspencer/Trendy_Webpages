     Summary: Audio shows Kevin McCarthy planned to urge Trump to resign after Capitol riotEnlarge this image toggle caption Samuel Corum/Getty Images Samuel Corum/Getty ImagesU.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had planned to get former president Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, The New York Times revealed in an audio recording Thursday.
McCarthy said he would alert the former president of his plans to begin an impeachment trial if he did not resign.
"I think this will pass, and that would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.
McCarthy had previously denied having the conversation, saying that an earlier New York Times report was "totally false and wrong."
Trump eventually faced an impeachment charge for inciting an insurrection a week after the riot.

     Audio contradicts McCarthy's denial that he considered asking Trump to resign after Capitol riot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) New audio of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy released on Thursday night reveals he did consider asking then-President Donald Trump to resign in the days after the January 6 riot -- contradicting his office's earlier denials of New York Times reporting that he had done so.
In the audio, which was obtained by the Times and first played on MSNBC Thursday evening, McCarthy is heard answering a question from Rep. Liz Cheney -- then a member of GOP leadership -- about whether there was any chance Trump would resign.
"The only discussion I would have with him is I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation that he should resign," McCarthy says, referring to the impeachment resolution in the House.
A spokesperson for Cheney said in a statement that the House select committee investigating the insurrection "has asked Kevin McCarthy to speak with us about these events but he has so far declined.
Representative Cheney did not record or leak the tape and does not know how the reporters got it."

     What Kevin McCarthy Tape Says About Donald Trump: Full Audio Transcript
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MSNBC's Rachel Maddow aired an audio recording last night of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying he was considering calling then President Donald Trump and recommending he resign from office.
The report is based on Burns' and Martin's upcoming book This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America's Future.
McCarthy had issued a statement strongly denying the report and criticizing the newspaper before the audio was released.
A McCarthy spokesperson, Mark Bednar, had also issued a statement before the release of the audio on Thursday, saying: "McCarthy never said he'd call Trump to say he should resign."
At that time, Democrats were pushing hard to impeach Trump and McCarthy addressed the matter in his comments.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Authors of a new book released audio of House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy saying he planned to urge President Trump to resign over the Jan. 6 riot — hours after McCarthy denied the account.
Why it matters: With the House GOP expected to win the majority in November's midterms, McCarthy — one of Trump's most unabashed allies — is on the doorstep of the Speaker's office.
But what I think I'm going to do is, I'm going to call him."
ET Thursday, the Times posted a story about the call, including a denial from a McCarthy spokesperson: "McCarthy never said he’d call Trump to say he should resign."
A spokesperson told the Times that McCarthy "never said that particular members should be removed from Twitter."
