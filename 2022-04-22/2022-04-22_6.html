     Photos Leak of Madison Cawthorn Wearing Women's Lingerie Amid His Ongoing Controversy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Madison Cawthorn, a 26-year-old Republican congressman from North Carolina, has been embroiled in lots of controversy lately and now there is more due to a photo leak.
Photos have leaked of Madison wearing women’s lingerie in a public setting and it looks like he is partying in the pics.
A man wearing women’s lingerie should not be controversial, but when someone like Madison Cawthorn is caught wearing clothing like that, it is.
The photos were provided to the outlet by someone who was formerly close to Cawthorn and his campaign.
People on social media have figured out that the photos were likely taken on a Royal Caribbean cruise during the Quest game show.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: POLITICO could not independently verify the photos, which are screenshots of original images.
A second person formerly close to Cawthorn and his campaign confirmed the origin of the photos.
The date the photos were taken is unclear, though they appear to show Cawthorn sitting in a wheelchair, indicating the event happened after his accident.
In the photos, he is wearing a distinctive pendant necklace that has appeared in other images and videos of Cawthorn.
After this story published, Cawthorn tweeted that the photos were taken of him during a game on a cruise before he was elected to Congress.

     Cawthorn Says Lingerie Photos Were from Cruise Game Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The article describes a public game show with a crowd of participants and published the following description.
Here’s how it worked: The cruise director would instruct a member or members of the team to bring him a certain requested item.
In its article accompanying the photos of Cawthorn, Politico noted that he had previously “outraged Republican colleagues with accusations of orgies and drug use,” and once suggested that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a drinking problem.
Politico acknowledged Cawthorn’s tweeted response to its article in a subsequent update, adding that the photos were taken during a game played on a cruise.
We also contacted Cawthorn for additional comment on the cruise pictures.

     Madison Cawthorn Appears to Party In Lingerie In Newly Unearthed Photos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementIt’s on that note that I’m quite confused to report newly unearthed photos of the freshman Congressman posing in lingerie, appearing to party and sip on white wine with a group of women.
In any case—amid the mystery of when these photos were taken, who provided them to Politico, and what happens next, one thing is clear: Someone—presumably Cawthorn’s own party leadership—wants him out of office.
And it’s not hard to see why, in the wake of Cawthorn’s self-inflicted cocaine-and-orgy circus, sparking intense drama and backlash that’s clearly still unfolding.
Ever since Cawthorn’s bizarre claims made on a conservative podcast last month, House Republicans have called on Cawthorn to name names.
One of the senators representing his state of North Carolina called him an “embarrassment,” while the other endorsed one of Cawthorn’s opponents.
