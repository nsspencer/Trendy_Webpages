     Stefanik, Colleagues Urge Court to Uphold Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined 53 of her colleagues in filing an amicus brief in support of the Title 42 injunction lawsuit filed by the Louisiana, Arizona, and Missouri Attorneys General.
“Joe Biden’s decision to end Title 42 is one more of his failed policies that will only incentivize the surge of illegal immigrants and flow of deadly drugs across our southern border,” Stefanik said.
Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) could reach full capacity within a few days of Title 42 ending and be forced to release illegal immigrants into the U.S, increasing the amount of illegal immigrants released into U.S. communities across the country.
Fentanyl that entered through the southern border accounts for approximately two out of every three fentanyl-related deaths.
The Biden Administration does not have an actual plan in place to prevent the surge in illegal immigration.

     Biden administration asks federal judge to deny request to immediately block end of Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Biden administration told a federal judge in Louisiana on Friday that the court should deny a request from more than 20 states to immediately block the end of a Trump-era pandemic restriction on the US-Mexico border.
In a court filing, the Justice Department argued: "Plaintiffs fail to show that they face a significant, non-speculative threat of injury.
DHS continues to prioritize Title 42 expulsions to the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras."
Texas also filed a separate lawsuit Friday against the Biden administration to end Title 42.
The Justice Department pushed back on that claim, saying that while it was deferring to traditional immigration protocols in some cases, numbers remain small.

     Texas sues Biden administration over plans to end Trump-era Title 42 immigration policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More:What is Title 42, when does it end, how does it impact US-Mexico border?
Texas is the latest state to sue the Biden administration over ending Title 42.
The decision to end the policy ultimately rests with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
CDC officials said in early April they were on track to terminate Title 42 authority by May 23, a decision made in consultation with the Homeland Security Department.
Under Title 42, border agents can pick up migrants who cross between ports of entry, process and expel them within hours — without allowing them an opportunity to make a case for staying in the country legally, including seeking asylum.

     58-member bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus backs bill to extend Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FIRST ON FOX: The Problem Solvers Caucus is backing legislation in the House that would extend Title 42 -- the latest sign of bipartisan pushback against the Biden administration’s plans to end the public health order in May.
Per caucus by-laws, all 58 members will support the legislation on the House floor.
If a plan is not submitted within that time frame, lifting Title 42 is automatically delayed another 30 days until a report is submitted.
Many of those Democrats have already spoken out against the lifting of the order.
Meanwhile, there were more than 221,000 migrant encounters in March alone, and that number is expected to rise further in April.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The White House is “definitely not going to reverse their decision on Title 42,” said Kerri Talbot, deputy director of the advocacy group Immigration Hub.
The White House has suggested to lawmakers that they pass legislation to change the CDC’s authority on the public health order themselves if they were inclined to.
The former administration official said the White House has long been planning for future increases in migration.
But Escobar maintained that Title 42 has not been an effective deterrent.
Some 1.7 million migrants have been expelled under Title 42 since it was first implemented, including asylum seekers.
