     Portugal identifies suspect in probe of missing British girl Madeleine McCann
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prosecutors in southern Portugal are formally accusing a suspect in the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, a British girl who disappeared nearly 15 years ago while on a family vacation in the southern European country.
In mid-2020, Germany’s police identified Christian Brueckner, a German citizen, as a suspect in the case.
McCann was 3 at the time of her disappearance from an apartment where her family was vacationing in the Algarve seaside town of Praia da Luz.
A picture of Madeleine McCann is held by her aunt Philomena McCann as she gave television interviews in May 2007.
Investigators in the nearby town of Portimao are leading the probe with the assistance of the Judiciary Police, the prosecutors’ statement said.

     In Madeleine McCann's disappearance, child sex offender designated as official suspect
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A man has been declared an official suspect in Germany at Portugal's request in connection with the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann nearly 15 years ago, a Portuguese prosecutor's office announced Thursday.
Madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment in the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007, a few days before her fourth birthday, sparking a media frenzy and an unprecedented international manhunt.
The public prosecutor's office in the southern Algarve city of Portimao said the suspect, whose identity was not confirmed, was identified as an official suspect on Wednesday.
In Portugal, an "arguido" is an official suspect but is not someone who has been charged.
"The case was reopened after new elements came to light," a spokesman for the public prosecutor's office told AFP.

     Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner formally declared
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Officials formally declared a convicted German sex offender as a suspect in the Madeleine McCann case.
Christian Brueckner was officially named as a suspect in the toddler’s 2007 disappearance but has not been charged with a crime, according to The Times.
APMadeleine McCann vanished during a family vacation in the resort of Praia de Luz in Portugal’s Algarve region in 2007.
Brueckner, referred to as Christian B in Germany due to the country’s strict privacy laws, is currently serving a jail sentence for raping a 72-year-old woman in the same resort where McCann went missing.
Kate and Gerry McCann, the parents of the missing 4-year-old British girl Madeleine McCann, hold up a picture of Madeleine during a press conference on June 6, 2007 in Berlin, Germany.

     Madeleine McCann: German investigation could last until next year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A German investigation into the 2007 disappearance of the British toddler Madeleine McCann could continue until next year, according to the state prosecutor in the city of Braunschweig.
Madeleine’s parents said they “welcomed the news that the Portuguese authorities have declared a German man an arguido”.
German police said in June 2020 that Madeleine was assumed dead and that Brückner was likely responsible for her disappearance.
However, British officers continue to treat it as a missing persons case and her parents “still hope” Madeleine is alive.
If the suspect in the McCann case was to be charged in Portugal, Portuguese authorities would need to take the same bureaucratic step.

     Madeleine McCann: Portuguese prosecutors say man named formal suspect in toddler disappearance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: British girl Madeleine McCann went missing from the family's holiday apartment in the southern Algarve region on May 3, 2007.
A suspect has been formally identified in the case of missing British toddler Madeleine McCann, according to a statement by the Prosecutor’s Office in Faro, Portugal.
The man has been made an official suspect by German authorities at the request of Portuguese authorities, but the Faro prosecutors did not name him publicly.
It is the first time Portuguese prosecutors have identified an official suspect in the case since Kate and Gerry McCann, Madeleine’s parents, were named suspects in 2007.
In June 2020, the spokesman for the State Prosecutor’s Office of Braunschweig, in the state of Lower-Saxony, told CNN his office assumes McCann is dead.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MADRID (Reuters) – Portuguese prosecutors said late on Thursday a man had been formally identified as a suspect in the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann 15 years ago.
He is behind bars in Germany for raping a woman in the Algarve region where Madeleine went missing in 2007.
Here are details about the main developments in the McCann case, one of Britain’s biggest unsolved crimes which attracted worldwide attention and a global hunt.
A British man, whose mother’s house was close to the McCann’s apartment, also won libel damages from 10 British newspapers after they accused him of being involved in Madeleine’s abduction.
In June 2020, British and German police said they had identified a new suspect, a 43-year-old German man.
