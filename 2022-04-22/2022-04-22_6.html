     Biden administration asks federal judge to deny request to immediately block end of Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Biden administration told a federal judge in Louisiana on Friday that the court should deny a request from more than 20 states to immediately block the end of a Trump-era pandemic restriction on the US-Mexico border.
In a court filing, the Justice Department argued: "Plaintiffs fail to show that they face a significant, non-speculative threat of injury.
DHS continues to prioritize Title 42 expulsions to the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras."
Texas also filed a separate lawsuit Friday against the Biden administration to end Title 42.
The Justice Department pushed back on that claim, saying that while it was deferring to traditional immigration protocols in some cases, numbers remain small.

     Summary: Border Patrol agents and advocacy groups helping migrant families are preparing for what the potential change in policy could mean for national security.

Former President Donald Trump enacted Title 42 in 2020.

     Biden White House stands behind Title 42 decision amid party revolt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The White House is “definitely not going to reverse their decision on Title 42,” said Kerri Talbot, deputy director of the advocacy group Immigration Hub.
The White House has suggested to lawmakers that they pass legislation to change the CDC’s authority on the public health order themselves if they were inclined to.
The former administration official said the White House has long been planning for future increases in migration.
But Escobar maintained that Title 42 has not been an effective deterrent.
Some 1.7 million migrants have been expelled under Title 42 since it was first implemented, including asylum seekers.
