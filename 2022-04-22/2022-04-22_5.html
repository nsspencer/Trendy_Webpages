     Summary: The latest raft of sanctions includes more US officials, media personalities and Canada’s John Tory and Doug Ford.
Russia has issued fresh retaliatory sanctions, including travel bans on United States Vice President Kamala Harris, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, the Premier of Ontario, Doug Ford and Toronto’s Mayor John Tory.
The sanctions come after a previous round of sanctions barred US President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from entering Russia.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: White House chief of staff Ron Klain, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg are included in the latest list of U.S. citizens sanctioned by Moscow.
WASHINGTON — The Russian foreign ministry announced Thursday that it’s sanctioning more than two dozen U.S. citizens, including Vice President Kamala Harris, by denying them entry to the country.
The ministry said in a statement that the move comes in response to “ever-expanding anti-Russian sanctions” brought by the Biden administration that have targeted Moscow officials and their families, as well as scientists, businessmen and cultural figures.
Several U.S. officials are on the list of 29 citizens that have been banned from traveling to Russia, including White House chief of staff Ronald Klain, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Holland Hicks, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby, State Department spokesperson Ned Price and Doug Emhoff, Harris’ husband.
The Russian government also sanctioned some prominent U.S. businesspeople — including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Bank of America CEO Brian Thomas Moynihan, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky and several heads of major defense companies — describing them as people who “form the Russophobic agenda.”Read the full story on NBCNews.com.

     Summary: Kamala Harris' chief of staff heading for the exitOriginally Published: 21 APR 22 17:18 ET(CNN) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' chief of staff, Tina Flournoy, is leaving her position this spring, a White House official told CNN Thursday.
Flournoy is slated to be replaced by Lorraine Voles, the veteran Democratic communications strategist who joined Harris' office as an adviser last summer.
In an email to staff obtained by CNN, Flournoy said she was "eternally grateful to the vice president for giving me this amazing opportunity," and thanked the staff.
The White House confirmed recently that national security adviser Nancy McEldowney would step down, to be replaced by her deputy Phil Gordon.
Republicans have seized on any apparent missteps, targeting the vice president relentlessly.
