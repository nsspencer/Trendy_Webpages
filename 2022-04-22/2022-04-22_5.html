     The Bad Guys movie review &amp; film summary (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This opening scene of “The Bad Guys” is its strongest, and it offers great promise.
Based on the kids’ graphic novel series by Aaron Blabey, “The Bad Guys” follows a group of fun-loving criminals who lean into their rap as the villains of the animal kingdom for thrills and profit.
Tarantula (Awkwafina) is the speedy and resourceful hacker, an assignment where it would indeed be useful to have eight arms.
But Wolf’s scheme is for the Bad Guys to pretend they’ve become good guys in order to trick everyone and remain ... bad.
At the very least, “The Bad Guys” encourages kids not to judge a book by its cover—and maybe even read an actual book about these characters afterward.

     The Bad Guys review: an animated heist movie that steals from the best
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two major signatures of DreamWorks Animation productions are frenetic action sequences and “adult” pop-culture references.
The virtual camera then follows Mr. Wolf and Mr. Snake across the street, where they knock over a bank.
Simply removing The Bad Guys from a superhero/supervillain context, however, helps distinguish it from its many predecessors.
The attempts at sly banter between Mr. Wolf and Governor Foxington are just OK — more theoretically cute than conversationally sharp.
Even when The Bad Guys resembles other movies, it’s stealing from them gracefully, with its own sensibility and energy.

     ‘When Do I Get to See Mr. Wolf’s Cock?’: Why Some Furries Are Losing It For ‘The Bad Guys’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Another is more to the point: “When do I get to see Mr wolf from bad guys cock in the movie.” (For those interested, there’s plenty on fan art on Twitter where you can see just that.)
Because Mr. Wolf is an actual wolf (albeit one voiced by reportedly human actor Sam Rockwell), most of the people posting about Mr. Wolf are furries, a term used to describe those who enjoy dressing up as or drawing anthropomorphized animals.
“The fandom is going wild for it right now,” Kabber Seifert, a digital artist and fursuit maker, says of The Bad Guys.
And nearly 10 percent of all tweets and replies to DreamWorks’ Bad Guys trailer included the word “furry,” according to TrendsMap data.
(Neither Rockwell nor Bad Guys director Pierre Perifel immediately returned a request for comment; DreamWorks declined to comment.)
