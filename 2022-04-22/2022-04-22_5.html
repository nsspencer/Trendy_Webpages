     Summary: F1's popularity has "now soared to such an extent" that there is "more interest from new venues than there are available dates on the calendar," according to Ian Parkes of the N.Y. TIMES.
One has to remember it is designed ultimately to entertain" (N.Y. TIMES, 4/22).
American drivers have "been virtually absent from the series over the past two decades."
Andretti made it clear that the team would "prioritize signing an American driver," something that Haas F1 Team -- currently the only American-owned F1 team on the grid -- has "never entertained."
F1 broadcaster and journalist Will Buxton, though, "remains on the fence" about whether an American driver would "necessarily impact Formula 1‚Äôs popularity."

     Summary: Formula One drivers would favour further adjustments to the sprint race format, notably to make it a standalone event rather than deciding grid for Sunday‚Äôs grand prix.
Autosport have reported that the F1 is therefore considering developing the sprint race into a standalone event for next season.
This actually could be a good idea.‚ÄùCharles Leclerc has backed some changes to the sprint race format (Getty Images)F1 managing director of motorsport Ross Brawn suggested the idea of morphing the Saturday sprint race into a standalone event ahead of the Italian GP last year.
If the qualifying on Friday meant the grid position for Sunday, and also for the sprint race, that could be quite fun.
I thought that was the whole idea of the sprint race - to make it interesting for the fans.

     Summary: Ferrari has opted to hand Sainz a fresh power unit for the Imola race weekend as a precaution due to the impact of his off in Australia and the tight two-and-a-half-hour turnaround between practice and qualifying on Friday in the sprint race weekend format.
‚ÄúCarlos‚Äô engine has been changed as a precaution following the impact in Australia as we do not want to take any risks with the Sprint weekend format,‚Äù Ferrari announced ahead of first practice at Imola.
‚ÄúAs a precaution, the team will fit a new power unit for Esteban at this weekend‚Äôs grand prix,‚Äù the team said.
‚ÄúOne of my strengths as a driver is to stay calm in these sort of situations,‚Äù Sainz said.
‚ÄúThis time, I lacked this calmness to react properly to the inconvenience that arrived to me at the time.
