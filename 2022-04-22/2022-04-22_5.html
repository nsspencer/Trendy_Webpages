     Summary: 12:27 p.m.Trump Jr. expected to engage with Jan. 6 committee — Donald Trump Jr. has agreed to meet soon with the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, a person familiar with the matter confirms.
The offer to voluntarily appear by the former president’s eldest son comes amid a raft of appearances from those who are closest to Trump, including his daughter Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner, and Donald Trump Jr.’s fiance Kimberly Guilfoyle.
Donald Trump Jr. sent text messages to then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows proposing strategies to overturn the results of the 2020 election and declare his father the winner.
“It’s very simple,” Donald Trump Jr. wrote to Meadows the day after the election, as reported by CNN.
In recent weeks, the committee has spoken with allies and officials in Trump’s immediate orbit.

     Why it matters that Kevin McCarthy lied
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) On Thursday morning, The New York Times reported that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had told colleagues in the aftermath of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol that he was going to counsel then-President Donald Trump to resign.
On Thursday afternoon, McCarthy issued a blanket denial that he had ever said such a thing -- calling The New York Times' reporting "totally false and wrong."
But CNN's Melanie Zanona and Lauren Fox reported that Trump and McCarthy spoke by phone Thursday night and that the former President wasn't upset.
Which suggests McCarthy could well survive this incident -- politically speaking -- and that his long-term quest to be speaker of the House may not be derailed.
Because this is what we now know about McCarthy, the top-ranking Republican in the House: He flat-out lied about comments he had made about Trump immediately following the January 6 attacks.

     Summary: Audio reveals Kevin McCarthy planned to urge Trump to resign after Capitol riotEnlarge this image toggle caption Samuel Corum/Getty Images Samuel Corum/Getty ImagesU.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had planned to get former President Donald Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, The New York Times revealed in an audio recording Thursday.
"I think this will pass, and that would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.
In January, the committee asked McCarthy to appear and share more about his interest to have Trump resign.
Tensions had been high between McCarthy and Trump on Jan. 6McCarthy and Trump had a shouting match during a phone call during the Jan. 6 attack, where McCarthy pleaded with Trump to take notice that the rioters were Trump supporters.
Days later, McCarthy took to the House floor later to say Trump "bears responsibility" for his role in the attack.

     Summary: "The only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said, according to the recording.
Later Friday, news outlets aired a separate audio clip of McCarthy from Jan. 11, 2021.
In it, McCarthy tells top House Republicans that Trump admitted he bears some responsibility for the Capitol riot.
The vast majority of House Republicans — who would vote on whether to make McCarthy speaker — have stayed loyal to Trump.
"The only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign," McCarthy said.

     Trump accepted ‘some responsibility’ for Capitol attack, McCarthy audio reveals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New audio clips reveal that the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, held Donald Trump responsible in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 Capitol riot, and that Trump himself accepted “some responsibility” for the insurrection.
Cheney asked McCarthy if he believed Trump would resign if Congress passed a 25th amendment resolution, which would declare Trump incapable of holding office.
This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America’s Future, by Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns, detailed scathing comments against Trump Republican leaders made in the days after the Capitol insurrection.
He also said he would support Trump should Trump be the 2024 Republican nominee.
McCarthy, for his part, did a more complete about-face: he has claimed Trump was unaware of the attack until McCarthy told him it was happening.

     Kevin McCarthy’s Sloppy, Artless Lie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is not only a demonstrable liar; he’s also a sloppy and inartful one.
David A. Graham: Marjorie Taylor Greene is just a symptom of what ails the GOPMcCarthy’s reported comments were especially revelatory.
Deviating from the Trump line is politically hazardous for any Republican, and Trump was furious about McCarthy’s mild public criticism in January 2021.
McCarthy’s Republican detractors have floated the idea of electing Trump speaker of the House.
That bodes ill for Kevin McCarthy’s political career, and worse for American democracy.
