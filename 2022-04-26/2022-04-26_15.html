     Is It Time For The Philadelphia 76ers To Hit The "Panic Button" Against Toronto?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is the scenario the Philadelphia 76ers are facing right now against the Toronto Raptors, as Toronto has won back-to-back games to make what looked to be a dead series very intriguing.
In Game 5 on Monday, the Raptors defeated the 76ers 103-88 on the road and Philadelphia seems shell-shocked right now.
Their 88 points was the Sixers’ lowest scoring output since March 20 when they were held to 88 points by none other than the Toronto Raptors.
Another blown lead in a playoff series could wind up being detrimental to the 76ers as an organization.
Going “all-in” for a championship by trading for James Harden at the trade deadline this season, panic is definitely beginning to set in for the Philadelphia 76ers even though they lead 3-2 in their first-round series over the Toronto Raptors.

     Summary: PHILADELPHIA — The Philadelphia 76ers once led this first-round series with the Toronto Raptors, 3-0.
Now, they have to head back to Toronto for Game 6 after the Raptors upset them in Game 5 on Monday.
The Raptors now feel confident they can upset the Sixers in this series.
“I think the biggest thing that I’ve seen is we’ve generated really good shots most of the series,” said Raptors coach Nick Nurse before the Game 5 win.
That’s what we all do.”Heading into this series, the Raptors knew the Sixers had more talent, but they play extremely hard and they fly around on defense.

PHILADELPHIA — In enemy territory, and on the biggest stage for many of them, the young Toronto Raptors could have withered without their all-star point guard in Philadelphia on Monday night.
But in a season rife with injuries, the Raptors have learned to win with — and without — the guiding hand of Fred VanVleet.
VanVleet is questionable for Thursday's Game 6 with the hip flexor, an injury that's bothered him on and off all season.
The Sixers have suffered the sting of a playoff loss to Toronto, losing in seven games in the 2019 conference semifinals on Kawhi Leonard's famous buzzer-beater.

     Summary: Here are 10 takeaways from the Toronto Raptors' 103-88 win over the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 5 on Monday.
: The first two games were easily won by the Sixers, who had four players excelling in Embiid, James Harden, Tyrese Maxey, and Tobias Harris.
But as the series has dragged on, the Raptors have found solutions to each one defensively.
Four -- Meanwhile, Nick Nurse is figuring things out: The Raptors coach doubled down on the same strategy that swung Game 4.
And for the first time in the series, Embiid was actively bad on defence to the point where the Raptors attacked him specifically in the third quarter for six straight drives.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sixers see their flaws, but Game 6 fixes don't sound like sure things originally appeared on NBC Sports PhiladelphiaEvery pre-playoffs concern about the Sixers looked exceedingly valid Monday night.
In his first season as Sixers head coach, Doc Rivers’ team suffered a second-round playoff defeat last year to the underdog Hawks despite holding a 2-1 series edge.
Atlanta won Game 5 on the road after trailing by 24 points with 14 minutes and 10 seconds left.
But through four games, the Sixers were in a fine spot on paper.
If they take it, the team will be able to view its flaws in a much more pleasant context than a looming Game 7.
