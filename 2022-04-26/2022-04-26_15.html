     Donovan Mitchell injury update: Jazz star has bruised quads; Utah reportedly optimistic he can play Game 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Utah Jazz announced Tuesday afternoon that All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell is dealing with bruising in both of his quads, and will receive treatment on them until Game 6 against the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday.
This comes after Mitchell left Game 5 Monday night with a hamstring injury, though the MRI on his left hamstring came back negative.
Mitchell landed awkwardly after trying to finish a drive at the rim, and immediately began grabbing at his left hamstring.
After the game, Mitchell said that his hamstring just tightened up.
Prior going out with the injury, Mitchell wasn't having the best game, putting up just nine points in Utah's demoralizing 102-77 loss.

     Summary: Utah Jazz star shooting guard Donovan Mitchell limped off the court after his hamstring tightened up late in the Mavericks’ 102-77 blowout Game 5 win Monday night in Dallas.
Mitchell said he will undergo an MRI on Tuesday in Salt Lake City but expressed optimism that he will be available for Thursday’s Game 6, when the Jazz are facing elimination.
“This is the playoffs, so I’ve got to find a way,” said Mitchell, who doubled over in pain in the tunnel while limping to the locker room.

     Jazz’s NBA playoff mess hits new low with Donovan Mitchell injury in blowout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Jazz can thank the Nets for saving them from being the biggest bust of the NBA playoffs.
A hobbled Doncic has scored 63 points in the two games since his return, thanks to his other-worldly talent and a shoddy Jazz defense.
And now the Jazz might be without their own superstar, as Donovan Mitchell suffered a hamstring injury while playing into the fourth quarter of Monday’s blowout loss.
“They’ve scrambled extremely hard,” said Mitchell, who had nine points and missed all seven 3-pointers he attempted Monday.
Otherwise, the questions start anew about whether Mitchell and Gobert can co-exist and are capable of winning a championship together.
