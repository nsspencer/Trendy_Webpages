     Alphabet announces $70 billion buyback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CEO of Alphabet and Google Sundar Pichai during press conference at the Chancellery in Warsaw, Poland on March 29, 2022.
Alphabet said on Tuesday that its board of directors authorized $70 billion in share repurchases, a major step up from last year's authorization of $50 billion and authorization of $25 billion in 2019.
The announcement on Tuesday is a significant acceleration in the Google parent company's strategy to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks.
Alphabet said it would take into account the stock price as well as market conditions when deciding when to repurchase its shares.
Alphabet stock dropped as much as 6% in extended trading after missing expectations for earnings and revenue.

     Google Stock: Assessing Its Growth Drivers (NASDAQ:GOOG)

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The analysis explores the company's growth prospects and concludes that the stock is a compelling growth at a reasonable price (GARP) investment, based on the current price.
eMarketer Forecast (emarketer.com)YouTube will be Top Growth ContributorDigital video, most notably YouTube, has displayed meaningful user growth and watch time.
The growth was primarily driven by the company’s cloud service offerings, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, which are continuously gaining momentum in the booming cloud computing market.
In contrast to Amazon's AWS, which generates 30% EBIT margins, Google Cloud ended 2021 with a negative 16% EBIT margin.
Even though the cloud market has been commoditized and dominated by a few large players, AWS remains the cloud market leader, and up to now, there is no identifiable cost advantage or strong network effect for Google's Cloud offerings.

     Alphabet Q1 earnings miss despite in-line revenue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, earnings came in lower-than-expected as costs mounted, and growth in the tech behemoth's YouTube business slowed sharply compared to last year.
For the first quarter, Google advertising revenue grew about 22% to reach $54.66 billion, topping consensus expectations for $54.12 billion.
However, YouTube advertising revenue grew just 14% to reach $6.87 billion, coming up short of estimates for $7.4 billion.

The unit grew sales 43% for the first quarter to reach $5.8 billion, which was about in-line with expectations.
