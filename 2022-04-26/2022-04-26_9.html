     Call for martial law raised in Greene texts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to CNN, Greene raised the topic in a text to Meadows on Jan. 17, 2021, more than a week after the insurrection and days before Joe Biden's inauguration as president.
"In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall law," Greene texted Meadows, misspelling the word "martial."
We have to get organized for the 6th," Greene said in a Dec. 31, 2020, text message, according to CNN.
Last week, while testifying about her alleged role in the Jan. 6 attack as part of a case seeking to disqualify her from seeking reelection, Greene said she could not remember whether she urged Trump to impose martial law.
Less than an hour and a half later, Greene texted Meadows again: "Mark we don't think these attackers are our people.

     Text messages from Greene put new focus on martial law testimony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When asked during a hearing Friday if she had advocated for martial law to keep President Joe Biden from taking office, Greene said she could not recall.
But a new tranche of text messages obtained by CNN shows Greene broached the idea with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.
In a text message to Meadows on Jan. 17, 2021, Greene told Meadows that some GOP lawmakers were saying Trump should call for martial law.
Greene testified under oath for nearly four hours as a witness during Friday's hearing and was asked whether she had advocated for martial law prior to Biden’s inauguration.
Attorneys on both sides in the case have until Thursday to submit final briefs to the court, meaning the new text messages might be cited by plaintiffs.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: John Bazemore-Pool/Getty Images(WASHINGTON) — Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene suggested in a text message sent three days before Joe Biden was sworn in as president that some of former President Donald Trump’s staunchest allies wanted to declare martial law to keep Trump in power.
The authenticity of the messages was confirmed to ABC News by people who have seen them.
“I don’t know on those things,” Greene continued in her exchange with Meadows.
Can I do anything to help?” then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney texted Meadows.
“They have breached the Capitol,” texted Rep. Barry Loudermilk, to which Meadows replied, “POTUS is engaging.”“Thanks.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE TESTIFIES IN LEGAL CHALLENGE TO HER REELECTIONOne text, sent from Greene to Meadows the day after the attack, in part argued that "Antifa was mixed in the crowed (sic) and instigated it, and sadly people followed."
I will continue to defend him," Greene wrote to Meadows on Jan. 7.

     What’s funny (and what’s not) about Greene’s ‘Marshall law’ text
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nevertheless, it was of interest why the right-wing congresswoman was even asked such a question in the first place.
The text messages, which were obtained by CNN, help illuminate how far the Trump White House and its allies secretly tried to go to overturn the 2020 election.
Regardless, the texts offer a striking behind-the-scenes look at the scope of the Republican scheming between Election Day 2020 and Trump’s departure from the White House.
But it was a text from Greene that generated headlines for a reason.
“In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall law,” Greene wrote, apparently trying to refer to martial law.
