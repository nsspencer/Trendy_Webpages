     Overwatch 2 beta includes redesigned scoreboard
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The long-awaited Overwatch 2 beta is now available for select players, giving fans a small peek at what they can experience in the full game.
This includes changes to heroes, new maps, and even more quality-of-life changes aimed at making the game easier to understand.
One of these many new changes is the addition of an updated scoreboard.
In the base Overwatch game, accessing the scoreboard gave players little more than a look at what players were on fire, how many medals they had, and their own stats.
The Overwatch 2 beta is rolling out for players who registered through the beta website but won’t be available to everyone that registered.

     Overwatch 2 Beta Test Starts Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Get ready to meet the next generation of heroes, as Blizzard has announced a Closed Beta Test for the hotly anticipated Overwatch 2 starting today, April 26.
While signing up for the Beta doesn’t necessarily guarantee you’ll get in this time, there’s still a chance for participation within future tests.
Most importantly, and I’m gonna bold this so no one misses it, you must own a copy of Overwatch to access the beta.
Although this upcoming test is for PC only, Blizzard does promise to include console players within future tests.
With Overwatch 2 gaining steam toward its eventual release and use in esports, it’s important to remember that Activision Blizzard is still embroiled in controversy.

     How to get into the Overwatch 2 beta
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Happy Overwatch 2 Beta Day!
Starting tomorrow and lasting for a few hours, anyone who connects their Battle.net account to their Twitch profile and watches at least four hours of Overwatch 2 from a list of streamers can earn access to the OW2 beta.
Unfortunately, the beta is limited to PC players only, but Blizzard has plans to open up OW2 beta testing to console players in the future.
If you don’t have that kind of time (or inclination) to earn access to the beta via gluing your eyeballs to Twitch for four hours, you can also try your luck the old-fashioned way by signing up for beta access on Overwatch 2’s website.
Correction April 26th, 1:45PM ET: The Twitch drops for access to the Overwatch 2 beta begin tomorrow, April 27th.

     Overwatch 2 has a new way to judge other players, and I'm nervous
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Well, obfuscate no more: Overwatch 2's new PvP beta has a real, honest-to-god scoreboard, and it's putting me on edge.
At worst, the new scoreboard could make Overwatch 2 less fun, especially for solo players.
Overwatch 2's scoreboard isn't unusual, but part of Overwatch's appeal has been that it doesn't try to be just like other team shooters, so I'm not sure why it is now.
But if useful stats are the goal, then Overwatch 2's scoreboard is already lacking.
At worst, Overwatch 2's scoreboard means jerks now have more tools with which to be jerks.

     Overwatch 2: All the hero reworks so far
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Overwatch 2’s first beta is now live, giving players a taste of substantial changes coming to Blizzard Entertainment’s hero shooter.
Those changes include a new five-hero team structure, a new hero, a new ping system, and substantial reworks to multiple characters.
In the Overwatch 2 beta, players will find very different versions of Bastion, Doomfist, Orisa, and Sombra on the roster.
Other heroes, like Reinhardt, Zarya, Cassidy, and Winston, have also received ability changes that update their kit in key ways.
Here’s a breakdown of the hero changes in Overwatch 2’s beta test — and presumably going forward.

     Summary: Like many other aspects of Overwatch 2, the scoreboard has been overhauled.
Blizzard EntertainmentThe Overwatch 2 PVP beta is now live (in case you hadn’t heard) and there’s one big difference that wasn’t in the alpha.
There’s a new scoreboard that shows the key statistics for all players.
MORE FROM FORBES The Overwatch 2 PVP Beta Is Now Live, Here's How To Get InIt shows eliminations, assists and deaths for all players, as well as their damage and healing output.
I liked that Overwatch was different from other games in only showing players their personal stats.
