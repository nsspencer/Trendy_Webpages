     Transnistria is just a sliver of land between Moldova and Ukraine. But it's becoming a focus of war.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Transnistria is a breakaway region that occupies a long, narrow slice of land alongside Ukraine and Moldova.
Moldovan government officials have long treated Transnistria with caution due to its close connections with Russia.
Experts say it's unlikely Transnistrians would join Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Transnistria is a literal powder keg, as it's home to a massive stockpile of aging Soviet-era explosives and ammunition.
Instead, it's taking place within the tiny European country of Moldova, at the border of the Russia-aligned territory known as Transnistria, which is home to an estimated 20,000 tons of Soviet-era weapons, ammunition and explosives, and more than 1,000 Russian troops.

     Summary: Russian-occupied area of Moldova blames Ukrainian militants for explosionsEnlarge this image toggle caption Ministry Of Internal Affairs Of Transnistria/AP Ministry Of Internal Affairs Of Transnistria/APKYIV, Ukraine — The president of Trans-Dniester, a Russian-occupied, self-proclaimed independent republic, says his government has traced recent attacks to Ukraine, according to Russian state media.
President Vadim Krasnoselsky has called on Kyiv to investigate what he calls the infiltration of Trans-Dniester by Ukrainian militant groups.
On Monday, the authorities in Trans-Dniester also reported a series of explosions at the Ministry of State Security.
The purpose, they say, is to spark panic and provide a potential pretext for mobilizing Russian troops in Trans-Dniester to attack Ukraine.
U.S. military officials doubt Russia has the military capacity to stretch its forces across the south of Ukraine into the Moldovan breakaway region.

After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, pro-Russian separatists fought a bloody war with the Moldovan government forces.

     Fears grow over Moldova breakaway region being drawn into Ukraine war
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Russian minister refused to rule out Moldova’s breakaway region Transnistria being drawn into the Ukraine war, in a potential escalation of the conflict to another European country.
After the security council meeting, Sandu said certain unnamed “forces inside Transnistria” were in “favour of war” and were interested in destabilising the situation in the region.
But he said recent Russian rhetoric pointed to some of the long-term goals Russia had in mind for Transnistria.
With Russian backing, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the early 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a permanent Russian garrison.
In the same bill, Sandu banned the prowar signs “Z” and “V”, first used by the Russian armed forces.

     Moldova Feels the Shock Waves of Putin’s War
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “There are very few people in that region who want to trade their existing situation for becoming part of a war zone.
As with other Russian-backed breakaway regions in Georgia and eastern Ukraine, Trans-Dniester offers Moscow a useful lever with which it can dial up the pressure on Moldova.
When civil war briefly broke out in Moldova in 1992, the Kremlin backed those fighters in the east and later became part of the peacekeeping mission.
Much like Moldova, Trans-Dniester is trying to walk a fine line, remaining coy on Russia’s war.
“People think the region [Trans-Dniester] is an impediment to the advancement of the country [Moldova], that it is perceived as an extension of Russia’s militaristic foreign agenda.
