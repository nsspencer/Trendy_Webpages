     $10,000 per day contempt fines against Trump begin Tuesday, judge rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Former President Donald Trump will be fined thousands of dollars beginning Tuesday for failing to comply with a subpoena from the New York attorney general, a state judge ruled.
In a three-page written order , Judge Arthur Engoron formalized the reasoning behind his decision made Monday in open court when he held Trump in contempt and said he would fine him $10,000 per day.
In the written order Tuesday, the judge wrote that Trump "willfully disobeyed" his prior order to comply with the subpoena for documents.
"Thus, Donald J. Trump is in contempt of Court and must pay a fine of $10,000 per day, from the date of this Decision and Order, until he purges such contempt to the satisfaction of this Court," the judge wrote.
Engoron also found that the New York attorney general's civil investigation is harmed by Trump's failure to comply.

     Summary: But Justice Engoron said Monday that the lawyers had not provided sufficient detail about how they had conducted the search.
Ms. Habba said after the hearing ended that she intended to file such a statement.
Ms. Habba also said she intended to appeal the ruling.
“All documents responsive to the subpoena were produced to the attorney general months ago,” Ms. Habba said.
In a statement, Ms. James applauded the contempt order, saying, “For years, Donald Trump has tried to evade the law and stop our lawful investigation into him and his company’s financial dealings.”

     Summary: The latest Saint Anselm College poll put Sununu’s public approval rating at 62 percent, up 9 percentage points from January.
Acciard is switching from running for Congress to running for governor.
Few Republicans in New Hampshire expect Sununu, who passed on a U.S. Senate run this year, to run for president in 2024.
Even if he carried New Hampshire, his victory would likely be discounted due to his home-state advantage.
New Hampshire is a small state with a meager fundraising base, and Sununu’s Northeastern Republican credentials would likely not appeal to hard line MAGA voters in other primary states.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Mr. Trump has willfully disobeyed a lawful order of the Court," Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a three-page order Tuesday.
The written order came a day after Engoron held a hearing on the issue and orally ruled that Trump was in contempt of court.
The Trump Organization denies any wrongdoing, and the Republican Trump himself has accused James, a Democrat, of a politically motivated witch hunt.
Octavio Jones | ReutersThe judge said Trump would have to pay $10,000 per day until he satisfies the judge that he has complied with the subpoena.
"Having stipulated to produce all the documents by March 31, 2022, Mr. Trump may no longer challenge the validity of the subpoena," Engoron wrote.

There was no better way for Kevin McCarthy to prove his allegiance to Trump than to tell a bigger lie than he did.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:Monday was a day of legal setbacks for former President Donald Trump.
And he's fining him $10,000 a day for not responding to a subpoena for business documents and information.
So yes, $10,000 a day is big money even when your name is Donald Trump, and you're someone who famously never likes to lose.
And they've accused the New York attorney general, Democrat Letitia James, with being politically motivated.

     Summary: The investigation focuses on Trump-owned real estate parcels including the Seven Springs Estate in Westchester.
In a second ruling, Engoron ordered real estate firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield to comply with subpoenas from James’ office related to the investigation.
Cushman provided real estate services in connection with Trump Organization properties for many years, according to James.
James said that Cushman prepared two valuations for the Trump Organization of the Seven Springs Estate, which is in New Castle, North Castle and Bedford.
The second valuation was an appraisal issued in March 2016, valuing Seven Springs as of December 1, 2015.

"Thank God for this judge who is now finally holding Donald Trump accountable for something," he said in a reaction video posted to Meidas Touch's YouTube page.
His lawyer, Alina Habba, claimed Trump didn't have the material James sought and referred her office to the Trump Organization.
James's office wanted three mobile devices Trump used and documents in filing cabinets near his office, according to court documents.
Pomerantz claimed Trump "is guilty of numerous felony violations."
