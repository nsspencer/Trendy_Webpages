     Grizzlies star Ja Morant throws down 'jaw-breaker' poster dunk of the playoffs vs. Timberwolves
    </h2>

     Summary: Grizzlies superstar Ja Morant has no regard for human life when he gets downhill and attacks the basket.

Despite a slow first three quarters, Morant shifted his game into another gear after that dunk, erupting for 18 points in the fourth quarter.
Earlier this season, the Grizzlies guard threw it down on Spurs' Jakob Poeltl.

     Ja Morant celebrates with Usher, Tee Morant following game-winning layup in Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That much is clear following his 18-point fourth quarter and game-winning layup with 1 second left to lift the Memphis Grizzlies to a 111-109 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves in Tuesday's Game 5.
Then Morant went over to his dad, Tee Morant, and music superstar Usher to continue the celebration.
The two were sitting courtside at Tee Morant's usual seats; social media lit up with mentions of the resemblance between the two following a TV cameo of Tee Morant during last weekend's Game 1.
Morant then took over the game in the final quarter, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:03 left.
Dillon Brooks' bouncing inbounds pass found Morant, who drove left and finished a layup over Jarred Vanderbilt with a second left.

Tuesday night’s first round matchup between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Memphis Grizzlies was quite the chaotic affair.
Looking to spark his team, Morant made one of the most absolutely brutal full-extension dunks we’ve ever seen.

     Summary: Ja Morant came up big for the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night, scoring a game-winning bucket to complete his team’s 111-109 comeback victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.
"I'm saving my greatest for that one more win"@JaMorant says he has more on the way.
The Timberwolves won’t go down without a fight, though.
That’s twice now that they have allowed the Grizzlies to crawl back to steal away a win and they’re hoping that this will not happen for the third time.

     Ja Morant’s all-time dunk in the NBA playoffs doesn’t even seem real
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Timberwolves guard didn’t need to try to take a charge with Ja Morant barreling down the lane and loading up for a poster dunk.
He could have let Morant have his slam uncontested, or he could have tried to foul him before he went up.
Instead, Beasley stepped up to try to draw an offensive foul late in the third quarter of a critical Game 5.
The Grizzlies were down big at the time, but this dunk by Morant energized Memphis on its way to a dramatic 111-109 victory to take a 3-2 series lead.
