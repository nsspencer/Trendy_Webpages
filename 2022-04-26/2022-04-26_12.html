     Biden blocks sales of inefficient lightbulbs, reversing Trump-era policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden administration on Tuesday announced new energy efficiency regulations that will phase out old-fashioned incandescent lightbulbs, a move that will drive down electricity use and curb greenhouse gas emissions from the country's power sector.
Incandescent bulbs, which are the widely recognized glass orbs with glowing wire centers, have been increasingly replaced with more energy-efficient alternatives in recent years.
More climate-friendly alternatives include LED bulbs, which look like the traditional pear-shaped incandescent bulbs, but use one-fifth the energy.
The administration's new rules will eventually phase out most incandescent and halogen bulbs on the market.
"By raising energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs, we're putting $3 billion back in the pockets of American consumers and substantially reducing domestic carbon emissions," Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said in a statement.

     Summary: "Mr. Trump has willfully disobeyed a lawful order of the Court," Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a three-page order Tuesday.
The written order came a day after Engoron held a hearing on the issue and orally ruled that Trump was in contempt of court.
The Trump Organization denies any wrongdoing, and the Republican Trump himself has accused James, a Democrat, of a politically motivated witch hunt.
Octavio Jones | ReutersThe judge said Trump would have to pay $10,000 per day until he satisfies the judge that he has complied with the subpoena.
"Having stipulated to produce all the documents by March 31, 2022, Mr. Trump may no longer challenge the validity of the subpoena," Engoron wrote.

     Summary: Former President Donald Trump is on the hook for daily $10,000 fines starting on Tuesday after a judge held him in civil contempt for not complying with a court order to answer Attorney General Letitia James’ subpoena for documents.

     Incandescent light bulbs will be off shelves by July 2023 under new Biden administration plan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The rule is an effective nail in the coffin for incandescent bulbs, which use a higher wattage than LED bulbs for the same amount of brightness.
The move is the culmination of a decades-long, bipartisan effort to phase out inefficient light bulbs.
Energy efficiency standards were included in an energy bill passed under the George W. Bush administration and implemented during the Obama administration.
Trump himself complained about the light coming from LED light bulbs, once telling House Republicans “I always look orange” in the energy-efficient lighting.
The efficiency of LEDs mean they last much longer than incandescent bulbs: LED’s typically last 30,000 to 50,000 hours or longer, while incandescent bulbs last around 1,000 hours, according to DOE data.

     Summary: Former US President Donald Trump speaks at a rally at The Farm at 95 on April 9, 2022 in Selma, North Carolina.
In a three-page written order, Judge Arthur Engoron formalized the reasoning behind his decision made Monday in open court when he held Trump in contempt and said he would fine him $10,000 per day.
In the written order Tuesday, the judge wrote that Trump “willfully disobeyed” his prior order to comply with the subpoena for documents.
“Thus, Donald J. Trump is in contempt of Court and must pay a fine of $10,000 per day, from the date of this Decision and Order, until he purges such contempt to the satisfaction of this Court,” the judge wrote.
The attorney general’s office asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt for failing to comply with the December subpoena.

Existing standards periodically come due for updates, and the Trump administration failed to act on dozens of overdue upgrades for household appliances such as gas furnaces and freezers.

At the court hearing, Habba maintained that Trump did indeed comply with the subpoena and did not have the documents James requested.
In his written ruling, Engoron said Trump had not refuted James' assertions that he failed to search several file cabinets for relevant documents.
The attorney general has questioned how the company valued the Trump brand, as well as golf clubs in New York and Scotland and Trump's own penthouse apartment in Midtown Manhattan's Trump Tower.

     Summary: By Luc CohenNEW YORK (Reuters) – Former President Donald Trump will have to pay a fine of $10,000 per day starting on Tuesday until he complies with a subpoena from the state attorney general probing his business practices, a New York judge said.
In a written ruling on Tuesday, Engoron wrote that James’ office had “satisfied its burden of demonstrating that Mr. Trump willfully disobeyed a lawful court order” and said Trump must pay $10,000 per day, beginning on Tuesday, until he complies.
Trump, a Republican, has denied wrongdoing and has called the probe politically-motivated.
Trump’s attorney Alina Habba said on Monday that Trump would appeal Engoron’s decision.
