     Doc Rivers Credits Raptors for Being 'Tougher Team' in Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But once the second quarter approached, it was clear the desperate team had the edge in the matchup as they had more urgency.
"They got everything they wanted," said Sixers head coach Doc Rivers regarding the Raptors.
The Sixers put up just 14 points in the second quarter after being outscored in the first 12 minutes.
I don’t think it was the second quarter.
With that win, the Sixers and the Raptors will head back up North for Game 6.

     Summary: PHILADELPHIA — In enemy territory, and on the biggest stage for many of them, the young Toronto Raptors could have withered without their all-star point guard in Philadelphia on Monday night.
PHILADELPHIA — In enemy territory, and on the biggest stage for many of them, the young Toronto Raptors could have withered without their all-star point guard in Philadelphia on Monday night.
But in a season rife with injuries, the Raptors have learned to win with — and without — the guiding hand of Fred VanVleet.
VanVleet is questionable for Thursday's Game 6 with the hip flexor, an injury that's bothered him on and off all season.
The Sixers have suffered the sting of a playoff loss to Toronto, losing in seven games in the 2019 conference semifinals on Kawhi Leonard's famous buzzer-beater.

     Summary: Here are 10 takeaways from the Toronto Raptors' 103-88 win over the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 5 on Monday.
: The first two games were easily won by the Sixers, who had four players excelling in Embiid, James Harden, Tyrese Maxey, and Tobias Harris.
But as the series has dragged on, the Raptors have found solutions to each one defensively.
Four -- Meanwhile, Nick Nurse is figuring things out: The Raptors coach doubled down on the same strategy that swung Game 4.
And for the first time in the series, Embiid was actively bad on defence to the point where the Raptors attacked him specifically in the third quarter for six straight drives.
