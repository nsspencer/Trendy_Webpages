     A Convincing Win That Was Anything but Convincing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The raw numbers of the game are not a magic eye puzzle; they are barely even a Rorschach test.
No matter how long and hard you stare at them, they will not suddenly become an image, clear and sharp, of something that bears analysis and interpretation.
They will certainly not tell him how Real Madrid manages to keep doing this, over and over again, seeming to draw strength as it comes ever closer to the edge, continually finding the will and the wit to conjure its curious, self-perpetuating magic.
Guardiola himself had acknowledged that before the game, half in jest, suggesting that there was not a vast amount of point in conducting the usual, instinctive analysis of Real Madrid because Ancelotti’s team is, by its very nature, so chimerical.
He meant it, most likely, as a reflection on the virtuosity of Karim Benzema and Luka Modric, the ability of some of the finest players of their generation to bend a game to their will, but it sounded just a little like he was saying Real Madrid does not make sense.

     How Man City beat Real Madrid 4-3 in Champions League semi-final first leg: Live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City will take a slender lead into their Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid after a sensational game at the Etihad Stadium.
Kevin De Bruyne opened the scoring inside two minutes with the fastest goal in Champions League semi-final history before Gabriel Jesus doubled the lead nine minutes later.
Although, that lasted all of two minutes as Vinicius finished off a brilliant run with an extremely cool finish.
After Aymeric Laporte was adjudged to have handled the ball inside the penalty area, the Real Madrid striker held his nerve to chip his spot kick past the diving Ederson.
The two teams will do battle next Wednesday at the Bernabeu to determine which side will play in the Champions League is just over a month’s time.

     Why Man City vs. Real Madrid was epic: What made 4-3 Champions League semifinal thriller an instant classic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the most incredible and memorable matches in recent Champions League memory unfolded at the Etihad as Man City topped Real Madrid 4-3 in the first leg of their semifinal matchup.
The match ended as the joint-highest scoring Champions League semifinal alongside two 5-2 results in 1995 and 2018.
7 - Man City 4-3 Real Madrid is the joint-highest scoring ever Champions League semi-final, along with Ajax 5-2 Bayern Munich (April 1995) and Liverpool 5-2 Roma (April 2018).
That was all Man City midfielder Bernardo Silva needed to produce a howitzer for a 4-2 Man City lead.
We probably shouldn't have been surprised this Champions League semifinal turned out like it did.
