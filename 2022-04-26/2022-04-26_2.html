     Moldova urges calm, boosts security after Transnistria blasts

     Summary: People wait in vehicles to cross the border seen from the Moldovan side of the Varnita-Bender crossing between Moldova and the Moldovan separatist region of Trans-Dniester, on April 26, 2022.
Moldovan President Maia Sandu on Tuesday urged citizens to remain calm while she stepped up security measures after a series of explosions in the breakaway Russia-backed region of Transnistria.
Advertising Read moreSandu convened the country’s Supreme Security Council after blasts on Monday and Tuesday in the separatist region bordering Ukraine raised fears of a spillover from the conflict there.
Sandu said after a meeting of the Supreme Security Council: “We urge citizens to keep calm and feel safe.”She condemned the explosions that hit Transnistria’s security ministry, a radio tower and a military unit, causing damage but no reported injuries.
Sandu said the Supreme Security Council had recommended that state agencies step up patrols and vehicle checks near the buffer zone with Transnistria, as well as tightening public safety measures and security checks on critical infrastructure.

     Summary: Russian-occupied area of Moldova blames Ukrainian militants for explosionsEnlarge this image toggle caption Ministry Of Internal Affairs Of Transnistria/AP Ministry Of Internal Affairs Of Transnistria/APKYIV, Ukraine — The president of Trans-Dniester, a Russian-occupied, self-proclaimed independent republic, says his government has traced recent attacks to Ukraine, according to Russian state media.
President Vadim Krasnoselsky has called on Kyiv to investigate what he calls the infiltration of Trans-Dniester by Ukrainian militant groups.
On Monday, the authorities in Trans-Dniester also reported a series of explosions at the Ministry of State Security.
The purpose, they say, is to spark panic and provide a potential pretext for mobilizing Russian troops in Trans-Dniester to attack Ukraine.
U.S. military officials doubt Russia has the military capacity to stretch its forces across the south of Ukraine into the Moldovan breakaway region.

She spoke after Moldova's Security Council held an urgent meeting prompted by two blasts which damaged masts that broadcast Russian radio in the region, where authorities said a military unit was also targeted.
Kyiv fears the region could be used as a launch pad for new attacks on Ukraine.
Separately, Transdniestria's Security Council reported a "terrorist attack" on a military unit near the city of Tiraspol, Russia's TASS news agency reported.
Moldova's Sandu described the situation as "complex and tense," but said she had no plans to hold direct talks about it with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

     Fears grow over Moldova breakaway region being drawn into Ukraine war
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Russian minister refused to rule out Moldova’s breakaway region Transnistria being drawn into the Ukraine war, in a potential escalation of the conflict to another European country.
After the security council meeting, Sandu said certain unnamed “forces inside Transnistria” were in “favour of war” and were interested in destabilising the situation in the region.
But he said recent Russian rhetoric pointed to some of the long-term goals Russia had in mind for Transnistria.
With Russian backing, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the early 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a permanent Russian garrison.
In the same bill, Sandu banned the prowar signs “Z” and “V”, first used by the Russian armed forces.
