     A Convincing Win That Was Anything but Convincing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The raw numbers of the game are not a magic eye puzzle; they are barely even a Rorschach test.
No matter how long and hard you stare at them, they will not suddenly become an image, clear and sharp, of something that bears analysis and interpretation.
They will certainly not tell him how Real Madrid manages to keep doing this, over and over again, seeming to draw strength as it comes ever closer to the edge, continually finding the will and the wit to conjure its curious, self-perpetuating magic.
Guardiola himself had acknowledged that before the game, half in jest, suggesting that there was not a vast amount of point in conducting the usual, instinctive analysis of Real Madrid because Ancelotti’s team is, by its very nature, so chimerical.
He meant it, most likely, as a reflection on the virtuosity of Karim Benzema and Luka Modric, the ability of some of the finest players of their generation to bend a game to their will, but it sounded just a little like he was saying Real Madrid does not make sense.

     UEFA Champions League: Real Madrid conceding 4 in Manchester City loss shows why missing Casemiro is vital
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Based on Tuesday's evidence, scoring at least once at Santiago Bernabeu is not beyond Real Madrid.
They countered an onslaught from Manchester City impressively to emerge just one goal down after a breathless 4-3 first leg.
City go to Madrid a goal to the good in the UEFA Champions League semifinals after a wild opener at Etihad Stadium and it could easily have been over before it even started.
A Daily CBS Soccer Podcast where we take you beyond the pitch and around the globe for commentary, previews, recaps and more.
Maybe the South American's absence contributed towards the wild goal fest we were treated to in Manchester so we should not wish for a destroyer to be back in action and likely to limit the goals in Madrid.

     Man City, Real Madrid Duel in Champions League Semifinal That Has it All
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The greatest gift Real Madrid has is its profound belief in its own capacity to win.
Again and again in the past decade in the Champions League, Madrid has found itself under pressure only for one of its brilliant players to do something brilliant just when it needed it.
The sense has been for a few years that La Liga sides can be physically dominated by Premier League teams.
Pressing was again the bedrock of City’s performance again here in what wound up tying for the highest-scoring semifinal match in Champions League history.
It missed opportunity after opportunity, although it won the shot count only 16–11 and the shots-on-target count only 6–5.

     Summary: Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich with a defensive and counterattacking masterclass as they look to take on Liverpool next in the Champions League semifinals.
Not all defensive football is anti-football, and Villarreal is adding a refreshing bit of diversity to a competition that doesn't feature as many different tactical styles as it once did.
"City has the highest possession in the league, we are not far behind," Klopp told Sky Sports in an interview.
Atletico Madrid employed ultra-defensive tactics to hold Manchester City to a goalless draw, but lost 1-0 on aggregate in the Champions League quarterfinals.
The presence of great defensive football is what makes great attacking football so satisfying.
