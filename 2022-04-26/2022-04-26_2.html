     A Convincing Win That Was Anything but Convincing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The raw numbers of the game are not a magic eye puzzle; they are barely even a Rorschach test.
No matter how long and hard you stare at them, they will not suddenly become an image, clear and sharp, of something that bears analysis and interpretation.
They will certainly not tell him how Real Madrid manages to keep doing this, over and over again, seeming to draw strength as it comes ever closer to the edge, continually finding the will and the wit to conjure its curious, self-perpetuating magic.
Guardiola himself had acknowledged that before the game, half in jest, suggesting that there was not a vast amount of point in conducting the usual, instinctive analysis of Real Madrid because Ancelotti’s team is, by its very nature, so chimerical.
He meant it, most likely, as a reflection on the virtuosity of Karim Benzema and Luka Modric, the ability of some of the finest players of their generation to bend a game to their will, but it sounded just a little like he was saying Real Madrid does not make sense.

     Man City make their Champions League mark but Benzema keeps Madrid alive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester (United Kingdom) (AFP) – "We have to do a magical thing," said Karim Benzema after Real Madrid performed another Houdini act in the Champions League to escape only 4-3 down from Tuesday's thrilling semi-final, first leg against Manchester City.
By contrast, this was just City's third trip to the semi-finals, but the English champions justified their status as tournament favourites on the night the Etihad Stadium may finally have warmed to the Champions League.
Had City not successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, they would have been banned from the Champions League for the past two seasons.
Last season, City swept aside Paris Saint-Germain but in front of empty stadiums due to coronavirus restrictions.
The ultimate test of whether City are ready to win the Champions League awaits next week when the cauldron of the Bernabeu will expect another Real revival.

     Villarreal’s Eye for Value Cracked the Champions League Code
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The supermarket, Mercadona, and the soccer club are corporate cousins.
Fernando Roig, Villarreal’s president and benefactor, has a minority stake in Mercadona, Spain’s largest retail chain, but it is his brother, Juan, the majority shareholder, who is credited with turning the latter into a staple case study for business schools around the world.
Central to that approach is the idea that the customers are ultimately in charge.
They are the ones, after all, who determine what their stores should stock.
To ensure the company is meeting their needs, Mercadona, every so often, invites a selection of its most reliable customers to take part in a testing laboratory.

     Summary: Based on Tuesday's evidence, scoring at least once at Santiago Bernabeu is not beyond Real Madrid.
They countered an onslaught from Manchester City impressively to emerge just one goal down after a breathless 4-3 first leg.
City go to Madrid a goal to the good in the UEFA Champions League semifinals after a wild opener at Etihad Stadium and it could easily have been over before it even started.

Maybe the South American's absence contributed towards the wild goal fest we were treated to in Manchester so we should not wish for a destroyer to be back in action and likely to limit the goals in Madrid.

     Man City, Real Madrid Duel in Champions League Semifinal That Has it All
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The greatest gift Real Madrid has is its profound belief in its own capacity to win.
Again and again in the past decade in the Champions League, Madrid has found itself under pressure only for one of its brilliant players to do something brilliant just when it needed it.
The sense has been for a few years that La Liga sides can be physically dominated by Premier League teams.
Pressing was again the bedrock of City’s performance again here in what wound up tying for the highest-scoring semifinal match in Champions League history.
It missed opportunity after opportunity, although it won the shot count only 16–11 and the shots-on-target count only 6–5.
