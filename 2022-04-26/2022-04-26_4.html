     AC Milan Clinch UEFA Champions League Spot With Four Games To Spare Guaranteeing €30 Million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AC Milan came away with a huge 2-1 comeback victory against Lazio at the Stadio Olimpico on Tuesday night in a match that keeps the Rossoneri in the title race for the moment.
But the more significant outcome of the game is that Milan have secured a spot in next season’s UEFA Champions League with four games to spare.
This is a big improvement from the 2020/21 season where we snapped up the spot on the final match day of the season.
As per Calcio e Finanza, that win guarantees the side about 30 million euros just from participation and bonuses in revenue for the upcoming season which continues to show the growth of the project since the 2018/19 season.
I am proud of the team, of the staff and what the fans are giving us.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MANCHESTER, England -- Manchester City and Real Madrid played out a pulsating Champions League semifinal first leg at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday, with Man City earning the 4-3 advantage.
His goal, scored after just one minute and 33 seconds, was Man City's fastest goal ever in the Champions League.
Jesus, meanwhile, has found opportunities hard to come by this season but has still managed to score against Arsenal, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and now Real Madrid.
Kevin De Bruyne scored Manchester City's earliest goal ever in the Champions League, and it set his side up to control Tuesday's semifinal.
The wastefulness let Real Madrid off the hook while the visitors also benefitted from Guardiola's problems at right-back.
