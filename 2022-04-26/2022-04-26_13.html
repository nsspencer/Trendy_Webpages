     Alphabet Shares Fall After Quarterly Earnings Reveal Slowing Revenue Growth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineShares of Google-parent company Alphabet plunged more than 5%—adding to severe losses so far this month—after the company reported lackluster first-quarter earnings on Tuesday which showed a slowdown in revenue growth while also announcing a $70 billion stock buyback.
The earnings miss dragged Alphabet shares lower, with the stock down nearly 20% this month alone.
David Paul Morris/Getty ImagesKey FactsAlphabet reported first-quarter revenue ($68 billion) and profits that came in slightly below expectations, causing shares of the company to fall roughly 5% in after-hours trading.
Alphabet saw a boost in its core search advertising business as businesses spent more on marketing coming out of the pandemic, but the company is now contending with slowing revenue growth.
Shares of Alphabet had fallen nearly 4% on Tuesday ahead of its earnings report, as Big Tech stocks led the declines in yet another bad day for markets, with the Dow plunging 800 points.

     Alphabet Q1 earnings miss despite in-line revenue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, earnings came in lower-than-expected as costs mounted, and growth in the tech behemoth's YouTube business slowed sharply compared to last year.
For the first quarter, Google advertising revenue grew about 22% to reach $54.66 billion, topping consensus expectations for $54.12 billion.
However, YouTube advertising revenue grew just 14% to reach $6.87 billion, coming up short of estimates for $7.4 billion.

The unit grew sales 43% for the first quarter to reach $5.8 billion, which was about in-line with expectations.

     Alphabet misses on revenue as YouTube ad business slowed by Ukraine war
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Paresh Dave and Nivedita Balu(Reuters) -Google parent Alphabet Inc on Tuesday reported its first quarterly revenue miss of the pandemic after the war in Ukraine hurt YouTube ad sales, leaving investors rattled as the global economy sputters.
Notably, YouTube advertising sales of $6.9 billion missed analysts' target of $7.5 billion, according to FactSet.
Story continuesGoogle's "other" revenue, which includes app, hardware and subscription sales, were $6.8 billion, below estimates of $7.3 billion.
Last week, Snap Inc warned that inflation, labor shortages and other economic challenges could pressure ad revenue.
Increasing competition from companies such as Amazon.com Inc and ByteDance's TikTok are chipping away at Google ad sales, too.

     Summary: The analysis explores the company's growth prospects and concludes that the stock is a compelling growth at a reasonable price (GARP) investment, based on the current price.
eMarketer Forecast (emarketer.com)YouTube will be Top Growth ContributorDigital video, most notably YouTube, has displayed meaningful user growth and watch time.
The growth was primarily driven by the company’s cloud service offerings, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, which are continuously gaining momentum in the booming cloud computing market.
In contrast to Amazon's AWS, which generates 30% EBIT margins, Google Cloud ended 2021 with a negative 16% EBIT margin.
Even though the cloud market has been commoditized and dominated by a few large players, AWS remains the cloud market leader, and up to now, there is no identifiable cost advantage or strong network effect for Google's Cloud offerings.
