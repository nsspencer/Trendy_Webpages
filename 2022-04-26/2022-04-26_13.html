     Ja Morant gifts his Most Improved Player award to Desmond Bane
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ja Morant recently delivered one of his best assists of the season.
The Memphis Grizzlies point guard was named the NBA's 2021-22 Most Improved Player on Monday.
But, rather than keeping the trophy for himself, he gave it to teammate Desmond Bane, who finished fifth in MIP voting.
Bane was certainly a worthy most improved candidate, as he played a key role in Memphis' rise to the NBA's second-best regular-season record.
He did it in an efficient manner too, shooting 46.1% from the field, 43.6% from 3 and 90.3% from the line.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Desmond Bane is a deserving candidate for this year’s Most Improved Player, that’s why Ja Morant gave him the recognition he also deserves.
Shortly after being named as this season’s MIP on Monday, Morant gave Bane the award he received.
Bane, who finished fifth in the voting race, was all smiles upon being surprised with the trophy in his house.
In comparison to his rookie year wherein he had 9.2 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game, Bane definitely made a huge stride in his basketball statistics.
Morant and Bane were two of the factors of the Memphis Grizzlies sudden emergence — finishing with a 56-26 record while occupying the West’ second seed.

     Grizzlies Ja Morant gives teammate, Indiana native Desmond Bane Most Improved Player Award
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Superstar guard Ja Morant became the first player in Grizzlies history to win the NBA's Most Improved Player Award, the league announced Monday, and he gave it to his teammate Desmond Bane, who finished fifth in the voting.
He went on to play TCU and was drafted 30th overall by Boston in 2020 and subsequently traded to Memphis.
The 6-5 guard set the Grizzlies' single-season record with 228 3-pointers during his sophomore campaign.
Spurs guard Dejounte Murray was the runner-up for the Most Improved Player Award, while Gary native and Cavs standout Darius Garland finished third.
Skiles continued his career in the NBA as well and won the league's Most Improved Player Award in 1991 while playing for Orlando.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shortly after winning the NBA’s Most Improved Player Award on Monday, Grizzlies star Ja Morant made the executive decision to gift his trophy to one of his teammates.
2 overall pick, in an ultimate gesture of respect, revealed on Instagram that he left his award in the possession of breakout second-year guard Desmond Bane.
“@_dbane1 i left your award in your kitchen gang, you deserve it killa,” Morant wrote in the post.
The 2022 All-Star also responded to a Bally Sports tweet highlighting his selfless act:As is often the case during award season, not every player with a compelling case earned a coveted spot on the ballot.
With that said, Morant is likely not the only one who feels Bane, the 30th pick in 2020, belonged in the conversation for MIP.
