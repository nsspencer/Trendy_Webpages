     New Video of Alec Baldwin's 'Rust' Shows What Happened on Set
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While preparing for a scene on the low-budget Western “Rust,” which was being filmed near Santa Fe, N.M., Alec Baldwin discharged a live round from a revolver, killing Halyna Hutchins, the 42-year-old cinematographer.
The film’s director, Joel Souza, was wounded.
On Monday the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office released footage from their investigation into the “Rust” shooting, in response to public-records requests by media outlets.
It includes body-camera footage from deputies responding to the incident and interviews with key witnesses.

     Summary: Police release a trove of videos in the probe of the Alec Baldwin film-set shootingEnlarge this image toggle caption Jae C. Hong/AP Jae C. Hong/APSANTA FE, N.M. — Law enforcement officials released a trove of video evidence Monday in the ongoing investigation of a fatal October shooting of a cinematographer by actor and producer Alec Baldwin on the set of a Western movie.
A search for the gun leads to the movie production's armorer, who breaks down in tears.
Baldwin said the gun should have been empty for a rehearsal with no filming.
In the Oct. 21 video, Baldwin repeatedly says there were no prior problems of any kind with firearms on the set of Rust.
The bureau also documented gun safety complaints from crew members that went unheeded and said weapons specialists were not allowed to make decisions about additional safety training.

     Footage shows Alec Baldwin practising with gun before fatal shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Newly released footage shows the actor Alec Baldwin repeatedly practising drawing his revolver on the set of Rust on the same day a live round was discharged from the gun that killed the film’s cinematographer and injured its director.
Other footage includes the chaotic scenes shortly after the shooting, with officers trying to secure the scene – a church – after first treating the injured.
“Somebody put a live round in the gun,” Baldwin tells police in the footage.
In the footage, Baldwin is seen in closeup, whipping the gun out of its holster and aiming it in front of him twice.
“There was a bang that was louder than I ever heard come from a blank before,” Souza tells officers.

     Alec Baldwin ‘not off the hook’ for charges over deadly ‘Rust’ shooting: sheriff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alec Baldwin is still “not off the hook” from criminal charges nearly six months after he accidentally shot and killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, the sheriff leading the investigation warned Tuesday.
“I don’t think anybody’s off the hook when it comes to criminal charges,” Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said.
Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office“Whether he’s responsible or not, will be up to the district attorney’s office,” Mendoza insisted.
Santa Fe County Sheriff's OfficeSanta Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza noted a “concerning” text message from rookie armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed trying to get live bullets on an earlier set.
“That was just a few months before the rust movie set and production began, so that is concerning,” he said.

     Alec Baldwin Seemed to Think Halyna Hutchins Survived Shooting—Bodycam
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alec Baldwin appeared to be unaware of the extent of Halyna Hutchins' injuries in police bodycam footage taken shortly after she was fatally shot on the set of his ill-fated movie, Rust.
"I don't know any projectile with a gun in a flash prop gun that could accomplish that," Baldwin said.
So whether someone accidentally, and I can't even imagine deliberately placed a live round in that gun.
Is that a live round?
If that's a bullet that was pulled out of his shoulder, then someone loaded a live round into the gun."
