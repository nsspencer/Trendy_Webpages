     Biden blocks sales of inefficient lightbulbs, reversing Trump-era policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden administration on Tuesday announced new energy efficiency regulations that will phase out old-fashioned incandescent lightbulbs, a move that will drive down electricity use and curb greenhouse gas emissions from the country's power sector.
Incandescent bulbs, which are the widely recognized glass orbs with glowing wire centers, have been increasingly replaced with more energy-efficient alternatives in recent years.
More climate-friendly alternatives include LED bulbs, which look like the traditional pear-shaped incandescent bulbs, but use one-fifth the energy.
The administration's new rules will eventually phase out most incandescent and halogen bulbs on the market.
"By raising energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs, we're putting $3 billion back in the pockets of American consumers and substantially reducing domestic carbon emissions," Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said in a statement.

     Summary: But Justice Engoron said Monday that the lawyers had not provided sufficient detail about how they had conducted the search.
Ms. Habba said after the hearing ended that she intended to file such a statement.
Ms. Habba also said she intended to appeal the ruling.
“All documents responsive to the subpoena were produced to the attorney general months ago,” Ms. Habba said.
In a statement, Ms. James applauded the contempt order, saying, “For years, Donald Trump has tried to evade the law and stop our lawful investigation into him and his company’s financial dealings.”

     'Trump has willfully disobeyed a lawful order of this court,' NY judge says as $10,000 per-day contempt fines start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Mr. Trump has willfully disobeyed a lawful order of the Court," Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a three-page order Tuesday.
The written order came a day after Engoron held a hearing on the issue and orally ruled that Trump was in contempt of court.
The Trump Organization denies any wrongdoing, and the Republican Trump himself has accused James, a Democrat, of a politically motivated witch hunt.
Octavio Jones | ReutersThe judge said Trump would have to pay $10,000 per day until he satisfies the judge that he has complied with the subpoena.
"Having stipulated to produce all the documents by March 31, 2022, Mr. Trump may no longer challenge the validity of the subpoena," Engoron wrote.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Former President Donald Trump will be fined thousands of dollars beginning Tuesday for failing to comply with a subpoena from the New York attorney general, a state judge ruled.
In a three-page written order , Judge Arthur Engoron formalized the reasoning behind his decision made Monday in open court when he held Trump in contempt and said he would fine him $10,000 per day.
In the written order Tuesday, the judge wrote that Trump "willfully disobeyed" his prior order to comply with the subpoena for documents.
"Thus, Donald J. Trump is in contempt of Court and must pay a fine of $10,000 per day, from the date of this Decision and Order, until he purges such contempt to the satisfaction of this Court," the judge wrote.
Engoron also found that the New York attorney general's civil investigation is harmed by Trump's failure to comply.

     Summary: So it was pretty unsurprising, though nevertheless stomach-churning, to watch him tie yet another false claim of the 2020 election being “rigged” to the plight of countless dead Ukrainians.
What’s happening is horrible,” Trump said, calling the situation “such a stupid war.” But, of course, he couldn’t help himself.
“I said, ‘Isn‘t it a shame, all those people are dead all because of a rigged election.’ Because if our election wasn’t rigged, you would’ve had nobody dead.”Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.
Obviously, this is a completely ridiculous thing to say, made more ridiculous by the fact that there is zero evidence the election was rigged.

     Analysis: Mitch McConnell thought January 6 would destroy Donald Trump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He had told the crowd that “you’re not going to have a Republican Party if you don’t get tougher.” He urged them to march to the Capitol building.
McConnell seemed to believe that, finally, this was the cataclysmic event that would drive Republicans away from Trump for good.
“There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day,” he said at another.
And he went on the attack against McConnell, calling him an “old crow” and trying to oust him from his position as Senate Republican leader.
It’s striking that McConnell, one of the top political minds in the Republican Party, so badly misjudged how January 6 would play with his party’s base.

Trump also repeatedly insisted the coronavirus was “under control” in early 2020, and we all know how that turned out.
This is absurd, but Musk’s views on free speech and content moderation pretty much jive with their outlook, and conservatives know it.

The interview with Morgan was interesting in part because Trump only rarely grants interviews in which the subject will be raised.
Far from the media withholding information, the media was robustly assessing and picking apart Trump’s claims.
But it did show that, 539 days after the election, Trump still has nothing to back his claims of fraud.
And that, 539 days later, neither Trump nor his most fervent supporters care.

     Summary: (CNN) Elon Musk just threw a wrench in the next US presidential election -- to the benefit of Donald Trump.
Already, there is wide speculation that a Musk-owned social media platform will welcome Trump back.
It's not that the median voter was reading Trump's tweets; the vast majority of Americans aren't on the platform.
Trump's outlandish tweets do indeed hurt him with liberal Democrats.
His outlandish tweets garner the kind of attention that makes normal people follow politics, as if elections were sporting events, or reality TV shows.
