     White House Says COVID Treatment Paxlovid Going Nationwide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 26, 2022 – The White House is rapidly making the COVID-19 drug Paxlovid more available, as the Biden administration puts renewed emphasis on treating COVID-19 rather than trying to prevent it.
As cases rise, White House COVID-19 response coordinator Ashish Jha, MD, said the administration is expanding access and use of Paxlovid, a medication made by Pfizer used to treat people 12 and older who have contracted COVID-19 and are at high risk of severe disease.
Paxlovid has been found to reduce the risk of COVID-related hospitalization by 90%.
Jha said the administration is increasing the number of sites in the United States that can order doses of the treatment directly from the federal government.
There will also be an expansion of test-to-treat sites, where patients can receive treatment right after testing positive, along with a campaign to inform doctors and nurse practitioners of the growing Paxlovid supply.

     With Supply More Abundant, Pharmacies Struggle to Use Up Covid Pills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Its use rapidly increased in recent weeks, federal officials said.
The White House on Tuesday announced a series of new measures to help get the pill to more eligible Americans, emphasizing the surplus and pushing doctors to stop thinking of the treatment as scarce.
Of the more than 2,000 test-to-treat sites, about half are CVS MinuteClinics with in-house nurse practitioners and physician assistants who can prescribe the drug.
Many of the other sites are Walgreens, Kroger and other chain pharmacies, as well as federally funded health centers.
Public health experts and patients who have tried navigating the program say that appointments can still be difficult to find, and can require long drives.

     Summary: Biden will make Paxlovid, a highly effective COVID drug, available to more pharmaciesEnlarge this image toggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesThere is a new push from the White House to get Paxlovid, a drug which reduces the risk of COVID hospitalization by 90%, into the hands of more Americans.
Many pharmacies have not yet been able to stock the drug and some physicians have been hesitant to prescribe it over concerns about depleting the supply — which the White House now describes as "ample."
Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House COVID coordinator, told NPR on Monday that despite a considerable federal stockpile, there have been problems getting the drugs off the shelves and into the hands of patients.
"We've got to turn those pills into prescriptions and into things that patients can get so they can get better," Jha said.
Now, the White House is set to begin that education push.

     Biden administration secures 20 million courses of Covid-19 antiviral pill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington (CNN) The Biden administration has secured the purchase of 20 million treatment courses of Paxlovid, Pfizer's antiviral Covid-19 pill, a senior administration official told CNN on Monday.
The administration will work with the manufacturer to accelerate production and delivery of the new drug to pharmacies across the country, the official told reporters.
A tranche of 100,000 courses will initially be available to pharmacies per quarter while demand and uptake are monitored.
Paxlovid combines a new antiviral drug named nirmatrelvir and an older one called ritonavir and is administered as three pills given twice a day for five days.
We have a big set of efforts that we have been working on and launching, and we're going to be doing a lot more this week."
