     A Psychologist Hired By Johnny Depp Testified That Amber Heard Has Borderline Personality Disorder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A forensic psychologist who was hired by Johnny Depp's legal team testified on Tuesday that she believes Amber Heard has borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder and does not have post-traumatic stress disorder.
Shannon Curry said that in preparation for the defamation trial, she spent about 12 hours with Heard, during which Heard took several mental health tests.
Her testimony comes as lawyers for Depp and Heard have tried to paint the other as the aggressor in their violent marriage.
On Tuesday, Curry testified that she believed Heard's test results revealed she had a personality type tied to anger and cruelty "usually with people who are less powerful."
Curry told the court that the defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder is instability, which shows up in a person's relationships, emotions, behavior, sense of self, and identity.

     What Is Histrionic Personality Disorder? Amber Heard Court Diagnosis Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A psychologist called to testify by actor Johnny Depp's attorneys said on Tuesday that ex-wife Amber Heard could have a personality disorder.
Under oath, Curry said she carried out a psychological evaluation of Heard, using case documents, medical records, mental health treatments, and audio and video records, eventually concluding that she met the criteria for histrionic personality disorder.
"The results of Ms. Heard's evaluation supported two diagnoses...borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder," Curry testified.
Falling under the umbrella of "dramatic personality disorders," the Cleveland Clinic says that sufferers of histrionic personality disorder have a strong need to command attention, and often use well-developed social skills to manipulate others to that end.
"For people with histrionic personality disorder, their self-esteem depends on the approval of others and does not arise from a true feeling of self-worth.

     Amber Heard Diagnosed With Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychologist Hired by Johnny Depp Testifies
    </h2>

     Summary: Dr. Shannon Curry, a clinical and forensics psychologist hired by Johnny Depp's legal team amid his ongoing defamation trial against his ex, testified that she diagnosed Heard with borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder.
Thus a personality disorder, she said, "is some sort of dysfunction in those enduring traits."
"When people are displaying these emotions with a personality disorder, there's a sense of shallowness to it.
Borderline personality disorder causes people to start relationships "very intensely," before turning negative.

     Borderline and Histrionic Personality Disorder: What psychologist Dr Shannon Curry said about Amber Heard
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The psychologist hired by Johnny Depp’s legal team has told the court that Amber Heard has two personality disorders – borderline and histrionic disorder.
She said they spent 12 hours together and that “the result of Ms Heard’s evaluation supported two diagnoses – borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder”.
Dr Curry said Ms Heard “externalises blame” and can be “self-righteous”, “judgemental” and has anger.
“All of it is like pistons of an engine, kind of firing off and igniting one another,” Dr Curry said.
She said borderline and histrionic personality disorder can appear as “two sides of the same coin”.
