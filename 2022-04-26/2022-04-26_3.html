     Look: Ja Morant Just Had The Dunk Of The Year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ja Morant just threw down the dunk of the year.
Take a look at the dunk here:This incredible play served as a much-needed momentum boost for the Grizzlies and their home crowd.
Previously down 13 points late in the third quarter, this dunk breathed some new life into the FedExForum as they head into the fourth.
On the very first play of the fourth quarter, Morant almost pulled off yet another poster dunk â€” this time on two defenders.
Morant and his Memphis squad will look to ride this momentum to yet another comeback victory this evening.

     Summary: Grizzlies superstar Ja Morant has no regard for human life when he gets downhill and attacks the basket.

Despite a slow first three quarters, Morant shifted his game into another gear after that dunk, erupting for 18 points in the fourth quarter.
Earlier this season, the Grizzlies guard threw it down on Spurs' Jakob Poeltl.

     Ja Morant celebrates with Usher, Tee Morant following game-winning layup in Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That much is clear following his 18-point fourth quarter and game-winning layup with 1 second left to lift the Memphis Grizzlies to a 111-109 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves in Tuesday's Game 5.
Then Morant went over to his dad, Tee Morant, and music superstar Usher to continue the celebration.
The two were sitting courtside at Tee Morant's usual seats; social media lit up with mentions of the resemblance between the two following a TV cameo of Tee Morant during last weekend's Game 1.
Morant then took over the game in the final quarter, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:03 left.
Dillon Brooks' bouncing inbounds pass found Morant, who drove left and finished a layup over Jarred Vanderbilt with a second left.

In Tuesday nightâ€™s Game 5, fans got what they wanted: a side-by-side of Tee Morant and Usher.

Previously in the series, Jaâ€™s father had been pictured sitting courtside with Karl Anthony-Townsâ€™ father.
For entertainment purposes, letâ€™s all hope for a seven-game series and another side-by-side of Tee Morant and Usher courtside.

     Ja Morantâ€™s all-time dunk in the NBA playoffs doesnâ€™t even seem real
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Timberwolves guard didnâ€™t need to try to take a charge with Ja Morant barreling down the lane and loading up for a poster dunk.
He could have let Morant have his slam uncontested, or he could have tried to foul him before he went up.
Instead, Beasley stepped up to try to draw an offensive foul late in the third quarter of a critical Game 5.
The Grizzlies were down big at the time, but this dunk by Morant energized Memphis on its way to a dramatic 111-109 victory to take a 3-2 series lead.
