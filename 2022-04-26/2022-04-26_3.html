     Amber Heard Has Borderline Personality Disorder, Forensic Psychologist Tells Court
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amber Heard was assessed and diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder by a forensic psychologist, who met with the actress and reviewed case files from the Johnny Depp defamation trial.
She told the Fairfax, Virginia, courtroom that she assessed Heard to have a borderline personality disorder, defined by the Mayo Clinic as a mental disorder impacting the way a person thinks or feels about themselves and others causing self-image issues, difficulty managing emotions, behavior and relationships.
Roberts recalled Heard coming in and apologizing to Depp, begging him to come back to their house.
Depp tried to drive away but Heard blocked the car and after arguing with Heard hopped in the car and the couple drove off.
Depp is suing Heard for $50 million claiming she libeled him in the 2018 op-ed piece in The Washington Post.

     What Is Histrionic Personality Disorder? Amber Heard Court Diagnosis Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A psychologist called to testify by actor Johnny Depp's attorneys said on Tuesday that ex-wife Amber Heard could have a personality disorder.
Under oath, Curry said she carried out a psychological evaluation of Heard, using case documents, medical records, mental health treatments, and audio and video records, eventually concluding that she met the criteria for histrionic personality disorder.
"The results of Ms. Heard's evaluation supported two diagnoses...borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder," Curry testified.
Falling under the umbrella of "dramatic personality disorders," the Cleveland Clinic says that sufferers of histrionic personality disorder have a strong need to command attention, and often use well-developed social skills to manipulate others to that end.
"For people with histrionic personality disorder, their self-esteem depends on the approval of others and does not arise from a true feeling of self-worth.

     Summary: The results of Ms. Heard's evaluations supported two diagnoses: Borderline Personality Disorder and Histrionic Personality Disorder," said Curry.
"She would suddenly be one way and then she would be very animated or very sad and when people are displaying emotions with this personality disorder, there's a sense of shallowness to it," she explained.
Very rarely and Ms. Heard did not, say, 'I feel vulnerable.'"
They utilize their looks to get the attention they're seeking.
During that trial, in 2020, the actress denied ever being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.

     Borderline and Histrionic Personality Disorder: What psychologist Dr Shannon Curry said about Amber Heard
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The psychologist hired by Johnny Depp’s legal team has told the court that Amber Heard has two personality disorders – borderline and histrionic disorder.
She said they spent 12 hours together and that “the result of Ms Heard’s evaluation supported two diagnoses – borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder”.
Dr Curry said Ms Heard “externalises blame” and can be “self-righteous”, “judgemental” and has anger.
“All of it is like pistons of an engine, kind of firing off and igniting one another,” Dr Curry said.
She said borderline and histrionic personality disorder can appear as “two sides of the same coin”.
