     Grizzlies star Ja Morant throws down 'jaw-breaker' poster dunk of the playoffs vs. Timberwolves

     Summary: Grizzlies superstar Ja Morant has no regard for human life when he gets downhill and attacks the basket.

This photo of Ja's poster ðŸ¤©(ðŸ“¸: Joe Murphy/NBAE via Getty Images) pic.twitter.com/hSvUOEGlqu â€” ESPN (@espn) April 27, 2022This wasn't the only Morant highlight you'll see from this contest, either.
Despite a slow first three quarters, Morant shifted his game into another gear after that dunk, erupting for 18 points in the fourth quarter.
Earlier this season, the Grizzlies guard threw it down on Spurs' Jakob Poeltl.

     Ja Morant celebrates with Usher, Tee Morant following game-winning layup in Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That much is clear following his 18-point fourth quarter and game-winning layup with 1 second left to lift the Memphis Grizzlies to a 111-109 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves in Tuesday's Game 5.
Then Morant went over to his dad, Tee Morant, and music superstar Usher to continue the celebration.
The two were sitting courtside at Tee Morant's usual seats; social media lit up with mentions of the resemblance between the two following a TV cameo of Tee Morant during last weekend's Game 1.
Morant then took over the game in the final quarter, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:03 left.
Dillon Brooks' bouncing inbounds pass found Morant, who drove left and finished a layup over Jarred Vanderbilt with a second left.

     Summary: Ja Morant came up big for the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night, scoring a game-winning bucket to complete his teamâ€™s 111-109 comeback victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.
"I'm saving my greatest for that one more win"@JaMorant says he has more on the way.
The Timberwolves wonâ€™t go down without a fight, though.
Thatâ€™s twice now that they have allowed the Grizzlies to crawl back to steal away a win and theyâ€™re hoping that this will not happen for the third time.

     'Call me': Ja Morant hits game-winner in Grizzlies-Timberwolves Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Morant drove for the game-winner with one second left in Game 5 Tuesday, giving the Grizzlies a 111-109 victory and 3-2 series lead over the Timberwolves.
The Grizzlies had more success with wing Dillon Brooks on Towns (not a compliment to Towns, a center).
But Minnesota committed 22 turnovers and ceded offensive rebounds on about a third of its misses.
But this game being what it was, Bane was also involved in a weird moment in the first half.
Seemingly trying to clear room for an inbound pass, Bane got a technical foul for pushing Timberwolves coach Chris Finch along the sideline:

     Ja Morantâ€™s all-time dunk in the NBA playoffs doesnâ€™t even seem real
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Timberwolves guard didnâ€™t need to try to take a charge with Ja Morant barreling down the lane and loading up for a poster dunk.
He could have let Morant have his slam uncontested, or he could have tried to foul him before he went up.
Instead, Beasley stepped up to try to draw an offensive foul late in the third quarter of a critical Game 5.
The Grizzlies were down big at the time, but this dunk by Morant energized Memphis on its way to a dramatic 111-109 victory to take a 3-2 series lead.
JA MORANT ON YA HEAD pic.twitter.com/066juBXfpi â€” Bally Sports: Grizzlies (@GrizzOnBally) April 27, 2022Morant pulling out that dunk at that moment is what makes him special.

     Ja Morant's highlight dunk, late heroics ignite Memphis Grizzlies' rally for Game 5 win over Minnesota Timberwolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Morant's exploits fueled a fourth-quarter rally that lifted the Grizzlies to a 111-109 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 5 and a 3-2 series lead in the first round of the NBA playoffs.
Prior to the dunk that ended the third quarter, Morant had scored 10 points on 4-for-12 shooting from the field and only 2-for-7 from the foul line.
And obviously, he had a brilliant fourth quarter."
After Timberwolves wing Anthony Edwards tied the game at 109-109 with a 3-pointer, Dillon Brooks inbounded the ball for the Grizzlies.
After hitting a shot over Morant in the fourth quarter, Minnesota guard Patrick Beverley unleashed a taunting gesture to the floor to say that Morant was "too small."
