     Moldova Explosions as Transnistria Communication Towers Blown Up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The prospect of the war in Ukraine pulling in neighboring Moldova has been increased after two antennas that broadcast Russian radio were blown up in its breakaway region of Transnistria.
"Moscow's plan to conquer southern Ukraine leads to Moldova," tweeted Kevin Rothrock, managing editor of news outlet Meduza.
Somebody blew up two radio antenna in Transnistria that were broadcasting Russian stations.
Kyiv has long warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin intended to increase the spread of his invasion of Ukraine into other countries.
He said that "control over the south of Ukraine is another exit into Transnistria, where there are also facts pointing to the oppression of the Russian-speaking population."

     Fears grow over Moldova breakaway region being drawn into Ukraine war
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Russian minister refused to rule out Moldova’s breakaway region Transnistria being drawn into the Ukraine war, in a potential escalation of the conflict to another European country.
After the security council meeting, Sandu said certain unnamed “forces inside Transnistria” were in “favour of war” and were interested in destabilising the situation in the region.
But he said recent Russian rhetoric pointed to some of the long-term goals Russia had in mind for Transnistria.
With Russian backing, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the early 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a permanent Russian garrison.
In the same bill, Sandu banned the prowar signs “Z” and “V”, first used by the Russian armed forces.

     Summary: A view of toppled Pridnestrovian radio centre antennas, also known as "Grigoriopol transmitter", following the blasts, near Maiac, Grigoriopol, in Moldova's self-proclaimed separatist Transdniestria region, in this handout photo released on April 26, 2022.
She spoke after Moldova's Security Council held an urgent meeting prompted by two blasts which damaged masts that broadcast Russian radio in the region, where authorities said a military unit was also targeted.
Kyiv fears the region could be used as a launch pad for new attacks on Ukraine.
Separately, Transdniestria's Security Council reported a "terrorist attack" on a military unit near the city of Tiraspol, Russia's TASS news agency reported.
Moldova's Sandu described the situation as "complex and tense," but said she had no plans to hold direct talks about it with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

     More Explosions Hit Moscow-Backed Transnistria As Fears Grow Moldova Will Become A New Front In Russia’s Invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineAuthorities in Transnistria, a Moscow-backed breakaway region of Moldova that borders Ukraine, reported two explosions on Tuesday morning, the second instance of violence reported in as many days amid fears the region could be dragged into Russia’s war with Ukraine.
AFP via Getty ImagesKey FactsTransnistria’s interior ministry said the explosions targeted a broadcasting center in the village of Mayak near the border with Ukraine.
Key BackgroundWhile Transnistria is internationally recognized as part of Moldova, it fought against the newly-independent Moldova in 1992 and has been largely autonomous since.
Chisinau—the Moldovan seat of power—acknowledges it does not have control over the region and there are stark cultural and political differences between Transnistria and the rest of Moldova.
Officials in Ukraine, Moldova and the U.S. fear similar tactics may be used to justify an attack on Moldova.

     Moldova calls security meeting after Transnistria explosions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moscow, Apr 26 (EFE).- Moldova’s president Maia Sandu on Tuesday convened a security meeting following a series of explosions in the region of Transnistria, a Russian-backed breakaway region in Moldova that borders Ukraine.
The separatist ministry had also alleged Monday that unknown perpetrators attacked the security ministry in the de facto capital Tiraspol with rocket propelled grenades.
There were no casualties in either incident, although reports and images from the tightly-controlled separatist region are hard to independently verify.
Moldova’s office of reintegration said the disturbances in Tiraspol appeared to be a pretext to worsen the security situation in the region.
The three dominant ethnic groups identified in the most recent census were Russian, Moldovan and Ukrainian.
