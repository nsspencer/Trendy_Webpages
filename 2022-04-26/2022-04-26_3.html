     Overwatch 2 beta includes redesigned scoreboard
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The long-awaited Overwatch 2 beta is now available for select players, giving fans a small peek at what they can experience in the full game.
This includes changes to heroes, new maps, and even more quality-of-life changes aimed at making the game easier to understand.
One of these many new changes is the addition of an updated scoreboard.
In the base Overwatch game, accessing the scoreboard gave players little more than a look at what players were on fire, how many medals they had, and their own stats.
The Overwatch 2 beta is rolling out for players who registered through the beta website but won’t be available to everyone that registered.

     How to get into the Overwatch 2 beta
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Happy Overwatch 2 Beta Day!
Starting tomorrow and lasting for a few hours, anyone who connects their Battle.net account to their Twitch profile and watches at least four hours of Overwatch 2 from a list of streamers can earn access to the OW2 beta.
Unfortunately, the beta is limited to PC players only, but Blizzard has plans to open up OW2 beta testing to console players in the future.
If you don’t have that kind of time (or inclination) to earn access to the beta via gluing your eyeballs to Twitch for four hours, you can also try your luck the old-fashioned way by signing up for beta access on Overwatch 2’s website.
Correction April 26th, 1:45PM ET: The Twitch drops for access to the Overwatch 2 beta begin tomorrow, April 27th.

     Overwatch 2 is taking pages from the Valorant playbook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the years since its announcement, Activision Blizzard has lost multiple major developers related to the franchise and reportedly fostered a problematic work environment.
As the Overwatch community feels frustrated and abandoned and workers organize at Activision Blizzard, Overwatch 2 has lost some of its shine.
Valorant is still very relevant today and has kind of taken Overwatch’s place during Blizzard’s dearth of updates for Overwatch and news about Overwatch 2.
How will Microsoft’s impending Activision Blizzard acquisition impact future support for Overwatch 2 and the studio as a whole?
These are all significant questions looming over Overwatch 2 that Activision Blizzard would probably prefer not to address outside of highly controlled PR statements.
