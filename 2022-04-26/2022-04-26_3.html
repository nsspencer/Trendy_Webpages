2 overall pick, in an ultimate gesture of respect, revealed on Instagram that he left his award in the possession of breakout second-year guard Desmond Bane.
‚Äú@_dbane1 i left your award in your kitchen gang, you deserve it killa,‚Äù Morant wrote in the post.
The 2022 All-Star also responded to a Bally Sports tweet highlighting his selfless act:As is often the case during award season, not every player with a compelling case earned a coveted spot on the ballot.
With that said, Morant is likely not the only one who feels Bane, the 30th pick in 2020, belonged in the conversation for MIP.
