She is part of an influx that comes at a particularly sensitive time for Moldova.
European leaders are aware of the critical position Moldova finds itself in as it struggles to shelter its swelling refugee population.
Vilatli Boicenko said he and his family did not believe the rumors of war circulating around Odesa, Ukraine’s famed port city.
“Odesa is and will stay a European city,” Boicenko said.

     Tensions surge after attacks in Moldova's Russia-backed breakaway region
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A view of toppled Pridnestrovian radio centre antennas, also known as "Grigoriopol transmitter", following the blasts, near Maiac, Grigoriopol, in Moldova's self-proclaimed separatist Transdniestria region, in this handout photo released on April 26, 2022.
She spoke after Moldova's Security Council held an urgent meeting prompted by two blasts which damaged masts that broadcast Russian radio in the region, where authorities said a military unit was also targeted.
Kyiv fears the region could be used as a launch pad for new attacks on Ukraine.
Separately, Transdniestria's Security Council reported a "terrorist attack" on a military unit near the city of Tiraspol, Russia's TASS news agency reported.
Moldova's Sandu described the situation as "complex and tense," but said she had no plans to hold direct talks about it with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

     Fears grow over Moldova breakaway region being drawn into Ukraine war
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Russian minister refused to rule out Moldova’s breakaway region Transnistria being drawn into the Ukraine war, in a potential escalation of the conflict to another European country.
After the security council meeting, Sandu said certain unnamed “forces inside Transnistria” were in “favour of war” and were interested in destabilising the situation in the region.
But he said recent Russian rhetoric pointed to some of the long-term goals Russia had in mind for Transnistria.
With Russian backing, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the early 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a permanent Russian garrison.
In the same bill, Sandu banned the prowar signs “Z” and “V”, first used by the Russian armed forces.

     Moldova's President Says Transdniester Attacks Are An Attempt To Escalate Tensions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "We urgently need humanitarian corridors that are truly safe and effective," Guterres told a news conference with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
The sprawling steel complex has remained the last bulwark of Ukrainian resistance in the strategic Sea of Azov port city.
“This gathering reflects the galvanized world,” Austin said in his opening remarks.
Lavrov also warned of the threat of a third world war and said there was a "considerable" risk of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons.
But Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Lavrov's comments are meant to just "scare the world off supporting Ukraine."
