     A Psychologist Hired By Johnny Depp Testified That Amber Heard Has Borderline Personality Disorder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A forensic psychologist who was hired by Johnny Depp's legal team testified on Tuesday that she believes Amber Heard has borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder and does not have post-traumatic stress disorder.
Shannon Curry said that in preparation for the defamation trial, she spent about 12 hours with Heard, during which Heard took several mental health tests.
Her testimony comes as lawyers for Depp and Heard have tried to paint the other as the aggressor in their violent marriage.
On Tuesday, Curry testified that she believed Heard's test results revealed she had a personality type tied to anger and cruelty "usually with people who are less powerful."
Curry told the court that the defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder is instability, which shows up in a person's relationships, emotions, behavior, sense of self, and identity.

     What Is Histrionic Personality Disorder? Amber Heard Court Diagnosis Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A psychologist called to testify by actor Johnny Depp's attorneys said on Tuesday that ex-wife Amber Heard could have a personality disorder.
Under oath, Curry said she carried out a psychological evaluation of Heard, using case documents, medical records, mental health treatments, and audio and video records, eventually concluding that she met the criteria for histrionic personality disorder.
"The results of Ms. Heard's evaluation supported two diagnoses...borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder," Curry testified.
Falling under the umbrella of "dramatic personality disorders," the Cleveland Clinic says that sufferers of histrionic personality disorder have a strong need to command attention, and often use well-developed social skills to manipulate others to that end.
"For people with histrionic personality disorder, their self-esteem depends on the approval of others and does not arise from a true feeling of self-worth.

     What Amber Heard’s alleged Borderline Personality Disorder means
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A psychologist for Johnny Depp’s defense in his high-profile defamation suit against his ex-wife Amber Heard said that the actress suffers from borderline personality disorder.
AP; EPA; REUTERSPeople with borderline personality disorder have an impaired ability to rationally balance their emotions.
Relatedly, those with histrionic personality disorder tend to have a penchant for the dramatic while exhibiting attention-seeking behavior.
Also in this group: antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder — the latter of which surfaced in headlines earlier Tuesday after shock jockey Howard Stern accused Depp of being a “huge narcissist” after watching the plaintiff’s “overacting” on the stand earlier this week.
APThough Curry’s assessment is not an official diagnosis, Heard may share that with SNL comic Pete Davidson, who has been open about his struggles with borderline personality disorder, and the relief he felt upon being diagnosed, finally able to name the problem.

Thus a personality disorder, she said, "is some sort of dysfunction in those enduring traits."
"When people are displaying these emotions with a personality disorder, there's a sense of shallowness to it.
Borderline personality disorder causes people to start relationships "very intensely," before turning negative.

     Depp v Heard: Amber suffered from 'histrionic and borderline personality disorders' and 'grossly exaggerated symptoms of PTSD', court hears
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amber Heard suffered from "histrionic and borderline personality disorders" and "grossly exaggerated symptoms of PTSD" according to a clinical and forensic psychologist who assessed her mental state following her split from Johnny Depp.
She listed what she considered to be some of Heard's personality traits, including "passive aggressive behaviour and self-indulgent and self-centred behaviour", as well as being "full of rage, inner anger and blame".
Heard's team also put it to her that she would not have been hired to testify had she not found the actress to be suffering from some form of disorder.
She told Depp's legal team she had witnessed the couple arguing on the island and heard Heard saying to Depp: "You're a washed-up actor... You'll die a fat, lonely old man."
She says Depp accused Heard of "hitting me with a can" and that he had "bruising on the bridge of his nose".
