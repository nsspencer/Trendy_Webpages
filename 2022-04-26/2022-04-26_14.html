     Trump’s $10,000-a-day fine for ignoring subpoena kicks in today -NY judge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Luc CohenNEW YORK (Reuters) – Former President Donald Trump will have to pay a fine of $10,000 per day starting on Tuesday until he complies with a subpoena from the state attorney general probing his business practices, a New York judge said.
In a written ruling on Tuesday, Engoron wrote that James’ office had “satisfied its burden of demonstrating that Mr. Trump willfully disobeyed a lawful court order” and said Trump must pay $10,000 per day, beginning on Tuesday, until he complies.
Trump, a Republican, has denied wrongdoing and has called the probe politically-motivated.
Trump’s attorney Alina Habba said on Monday that Trump would appeal Engoron’s decision.

     Summary: But Justice Engoron said Monday that the lawyers had not provided sufficient detail about how they had conducted the search.
Ms. Habba said after the hearing ended that she intended to file such a statement.
Ms. Habba also said she intended to appeal the ruling.
“All documents responsive to the subpoena were produced to the attorney general months ago,” Ms. Habba said.
In a statement, Ms. James applauded the contempt order, saying, “For years, Donald Trump has tried to evade the law and stop our lawful investigation into him and his company’s financial dealings.”

     Summary: "Mr. Trump has willfully disobeyed a lawful order of the court," Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a three-page order Tuesday.
The Trump Organization denies any wrongdoing, and the Republican Trump himself has accused James, a Democrat, of a politically motivated witch hunt.

"Having stipulated to produce all the documents by March 31, 2022, Mr. Trump may no longer challenge the validity of the subpoena," Engoron wrote.

     $10,000 per day contempt fines against Trump begin Tuesday, judge rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former US President Donald Trump speaks at a rally at The Farm at 95 on April 9, 2022 in Selma, North Carolina.
In a three-page written order, Judge Arthur Engoron formalized the reasoning behind his decision made Monday in open court when he held Trump in contempt and said he would fine him $10,000 per day.
In the written order Tuesday, the judge wrote that Trump “willfully disobeyed” his prior order to comply with the subpoena for documents.
“Thus, Donald J. Trump is in contempt of Court and must pay a fine of $10,000 per day, from the date of this Decision and Order, until he purges such contempt to the satisfaction of this Court,” the judge wrote.
The attorney general’s office asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt for failing to comply with the December subpoena.

     Summary: New York judge holds Trump in contempt of court and fines him $10,000 per dayA judge has found former President Donald Trump in contempt of court.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:Monday was a day of legal setbacks for former President Donald Trump.
And he's fining him $10,000 a day for not responding to a subpoena for business documents and information.
So yes, $10,000 a day is big money even when your name is Donald Trump, and you're someone who famously never likes to lose.
And they've accused the New York attorney general, Democrat Letitia James, with being politically motivated.

     Donald Trump cited for civil contempt for failing to comply with subpoena
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Monday, New York Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron held former President Donald Trump in civil contempt for failing to comply with a December 2021 subpoena requiring him to turn over documents requested by New York Attorney General Leticia James.
The subpoena was part of a long-running financial fraud investigation into the Trump Organization and other Trump family businesses.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)Last month, Engoron rejected a bid from Trump, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. to quash a separate subpoena compelling their testimony as part of James’ civil investigation into the Trump business empire.
Even so, Trump attorney Alina Habba signaled her client’s intention to appeal the ruling, delaying any payment by Trump of the fines.
