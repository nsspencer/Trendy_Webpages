     Trump’s $10,000-a-day fine for ignoring subpoena kicks in today -NY judge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Luc CohenNEW YORK (Reuters) – Former President Donald Trump will have to pay a fine of $10,000 per day starting on Tuesday until he complies with a subpoena from the state attorney general probing his business practices, a New York judge said.
In a written ruling on Tuesday, Engoron wrote that James’ office had “satisfied its burden of demonstrating that Mr. Trump willfully disobeyed a lawful court order” and said Trump must pay $10,000 per day, beginning on Tuesday, until he complies.
Trump, a Republican, has denied wrongdoing and has called the probe politically-motivated.
Trump’s attorney Alina Habba said on Monday that Trump would appeal Engoron’s decision.

“All documents responsive to the subpoena were produced to the attorney general months ago,” Ms. Habba said.

     $10,000 per day contempt fines against Trump begin Tuesday, judge rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Former President Donald Trump will be fined thousands of dollars beginning Tuesday for failing to comply with a subpoena from the New York attorney general, a state judge ruled.
In a three-page written order , Judge Arthur Engoron formalized the reasoning behind his decision made Monday in open court when he held Trump in contempt and said he would fine him $10,000 per day.
In the written order Tuesday, the judge wrote that Trump "willfully disobeyed" his prior order to comply with the subpoena for documents.
"Thus, Donald J. Trump is in contempt of Court and must pay a fine of $10,000 per day, from the date of this Decision and Order, until he purges such contempt to the satisfaction of this Court," the judge wrote.
Engoron also found that the New York attorney general's civil investigation is harmed by Trump's failure to comply.

     'Trump has willfully disobeyed a lawful order of this court,' NY judge says as $10,000 per-day contempt fines start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Mr. Trump has willfully disobeyed a lawful order of the Court," Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a three-page order Tuesday.
The written order came a day after Engoron held a hearing on the issue and orally ruled that Trump was in contempt of court.
The Trump Organization denies any wrongdoing, and the Republican Trump himself has accused James, a Democrat, of a politically motivated witch hunt.
Octavio Jones | ReutersThe judge said Trump would have to pay $10,000 per day until he satisfies the judge that he has complied with the subpoena.
"Having stipulated to produce all the documents by March 31, 2022, Mr. Trump may no longer challenge the validity of the subpoena," Engoron wrote.

     Summary: New York judge holds Trump in contempt of court and fines him $10,000 per dayA judge has found former President Donald Trump in contempt of court.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:Monday was a day of legal setbacks for former President Donald Trump.
And he's fining him $10,000 a day for not responding to a subpoena for business documents and information.
So yes, $10,000 a day is big money even when your name is Donald Trump, and you're someone who famously never likes to lose.
And they've accused the New York attorney general, Democrat Letitia James, with being politically motivated.
