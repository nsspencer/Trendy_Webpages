     Bad Bunny unveiled as new Marvel superhero 'El Muerto'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, better known by his stage name, Bad Bunny, has been cast as the newest Marvel hero in Sony Pictures’ portfolio of the super characters — and will lead the standalone comic book film “El Muerto.”“El Muerto” is set to hit theaters on Jan. 12, 2024.
“To bring El Muerto to life is just incredible .. so exciting,” the chart-topping rapper told the crowd, adding that he grew up a fan of wrestling.
Known as Juan-Carlos Estrada Sanchez in the comics, El Muerto is a wrestler whose powers are handed down by ancestry in the form of a mask (which, according to Marvel’s official site, gives him superhuman strength).
In past comic narratives, El Muerto has gotten in the ring with Spider-Man himself.
On stage at CinemaCon, Sony brass suggested Ocasio will portray an antihero on the verge of inheriting his father’s power.

As of this writing, El Muerto is set to hit theaters on January 12, 2024.
To make matters worse, while he was recovering from his defeat El Muerto was ambushed by El Dorado.
It’s possible that El Muerto will tell a similar story about a young man forced to assume his father’s wrestler mantle.
