     Madison Cawthorn Again Brought a Loaded Gun to the Airport, Officials Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Representative Madison Cawthorn was briefly detained by the police on Tuesday after trying to bring a loaded gun through airport security in Charlotte, N.C., in his carry-on bag, the second time in a little more than a year that the North Carolina Republican has been stopped from flying with a firearm.
The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department confirmed the details of the latest episode involving Mr. Cawthorn, 26, a pro-Trump congressman whose bizarre antics and missteps had already threatened to derail his re-election bid.
Mr. Cawthorn, the youngest member of the House, was passing through Security Checkpoint D at Charlotte Douglas International Airport around 9 a.m. when a Transportation Security Administration agent saw the image of a gun on an X-ray machine, the authorities said.
Police officers were called to the checkpoint, where law enforcement officials said that Mr. Cawthorn acknowledged that the gun, a loaded Staccato 9-millimeter pistol, belonged to him.
Describing Mr. Cawthorn as cooperative, the police said they cited the congressman with possession of a dangerous weapon on city property.

     Republican Madison Cawthorn cited for carrying gun in his bag at airport
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The far-right North Carolina Republican congressman Madison Cawthorn is facing a misdemeanor criminal charge after police at an airport in his home state said they found a gun in his bag Tuesday.
Police didn’t arrest Cawthorn, instead essentially issuing him a ticket summoning him to return to court at a later date to answer to the weapon charge.
According to police, officers at the airport’s security screening checkpoint spotted a gun in a bag belonging to Cawthorn.
Tuesday was not the first time law enforcement officials have reportedly found a gun on Cawthorn at an airport.
TSA agents at the regional airport in Cawthorn’s hometown of Asheville, North Carolina, seized a pistol from his bag in February 2021.
