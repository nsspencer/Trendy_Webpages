     A Convincing Win That Was Anything but Convincing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The raw numbers of the game are not a magic eye puzzle; they are barely even a Rorschach test.
No matter how long and hard you stare at them, they will not suddenly become an image, clear and sharp, of something that bears analysis and interpretation.
They will certainly not tell him how Real Madrid manages to keep doing this, over and over again, seeming to draw strength as it comes ever closer to the edge, continually finding the will and the wit to conjure its curious, self-perpetuating magic.
Guardiola himself had acknowledged that before the game, half in jest, suggesting that there was not a vast amount of point in conducting the usual, instinctive analysis of Real Madrid because Ancelotti’s team is, by its very nature, so chimerical.
He meant it, most likely, as a reflection on the virtuosity of Karim Benzema and Luka Modric, the ability of some of the finest players of their generation to bend a game to their will, but it sounded just a little like he was saying Real Madrid does not make sense.

     Man City beat Real Madrid 4-3 in Champions League thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MANCHESTER, England, April 26 (Reuters) - After one of the greatest of Champions League semi-final clashes, Manchester City will take a 4-3 lead into the second leg of their tie against Real Madrid following an extraordinary encounter at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday.
But it is two games and we have another one in one week," said City manager Pep Guardiola.
It was the first time that 13-times European champions Real had conceded two goals so quickly in the Champions League and another looked on the cards.
Reigning Premier League champions City were on fire, running Spanish league leaders Real ragged, but Mahrez and Phil Foden were both unable to convert promising chances.
City, yet to be crowned European champions, were left with the strange feeling of disappointment at 'only' beating Real by one goal.

     UEFA Champions League: Real Madrid conceding 4 in Manchester City loss shows why missing Casemiro is vital
    </h2>

     Summary: Based on Tuesday's evidence, scoring at least once at Santiago Bernabeu is not beyond Real Madrid.
They countered an onslaught from Manchester City impressively to emerge just one goal down after a breathless 4-3 first leg.
City go to Madrid a goal to the good in the UEFA Champions League semifinals after a wild opener at Etihad Stadium and it could easily have been over before it even started.

Maybe the South American's absence contributed towards the wild goal fest we were treated to in Manchester so we should not wish for a destroyer to be back in action and likely to limit the goals in Madrid.

     Summary: The greatest gift Real Madrid has is its profound belief in its own capacity to win.
Again and again in the past decade in the Champions League, Madrid has found itself under pressure only for one of its brilliant players to do something brilliant just when it needed it.

Pressing was again the bedrock of City’s performance again here in what wound up tying for the highest-scoring semifinal match in Champions League history.
