     LIVE: Man City Hosts Real Madrid to Open Champions League Semifinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With a trip to the final on the line, Manchester City and Real Madrid will meet in the Champions League knockout stage once again.
City got the better of Real in their last meeting: a pandemic-delayed quarterfinal in 2020 when City scored a pair of 2–1 wins to advance on a 4–2 aggregate.
However, Real Madrid eliminated City in the 2016 semifinals on a tight 1–0 aggregate en route to its first of three straight Champions League titles.
Next up is a Man City team that many consider to be the Champions League favorite along with Premier League rival Liverpool.
Then, City held on for a scrappy 1–0 aggregate win over Atlético Madrid in the quarterfinal.

     Champions League Semifinals: Manchester City vs. Real Madrid odds, pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City and Real Madrid begin their two-leg Champions League semifinal on Tuesday afternoon.
City are prohibitive -220 favorites on the three-way moneyline for the first leg, with Real Madrid coming back at +550 and the draw sitting with odds of +360.
While City have looked like one of the best teams in the world throughout their season, Real Madrid have achieved their results in a different fashion.
Los Blancos are runaway winners in La Liga, but their expected goal differential is second-best in Spain and suggests that Real Madrid is a bit fortunate to have such a big cushion over Atletico Madrid and Barcelona.
Manchester City takes on Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinals on Saturday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, the most important layer of validation for MLS has remained elusive: a CONCACAF Champions League winner.
That opportunity arrives again this week, as the Seattle Sounders and Pumas begin the two-legged CCL final, starting Wednesday in Mexico City with the return leg in Seattle on May 4.
It's rare for an MLS team to make it this far.
This is their seventh time in the Champions League, and no team has had as much sustained success as the Sounders since they entered the league.
The Seattle Sounders have the chance to deliver MLS its first ever CONCACAF Champions League when they meet Pumas in the final.

City and Real Madrid, who both lead their respective domestic leagues, met in the Champions League round of 16 two years ago, with the Premier League team winning both legs by identical 2-1 scores.

Chelsea took five years to reach a Champions League final following Roman Abramovich's takeover in 2003 and nine years to win it.
So there are no more excuses for failing to win the Champions League.
It was the same in Porto last season, which is probably why it remains such a sore subject, but after 14 years of investment and elite recruitment, it's time for City to deliver in the Champions League.
