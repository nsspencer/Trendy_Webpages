     Summary: Manchester City and Real Madrid begin their two-leg Champions League semifinal on Tuesday afternoon.
City are prohibitive -220 favorites on the three-way moneyline for the first leg, with Real Madrid coming back at +550 and the draw sitting with odds of +360.
While City have looked like one of the best teams in the world throughout their season, Real Madrid have achieved their results in a different fashion.
Los Blancos are runaway winners in La Liga, but their expected goal differential is second-best in Spain and suggests that Real Madrid is a bit fortunate to have such a big cushion over Atletico Madrid and Barcelona.
Manchester City takes on Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinals on Saturday.

     Summary: MANCHESTER, England -- Manchester City and Real Madrid played out a pulsating Champions League semifinal first leg at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday, with Man City earning the 4-3 advantage.
His goal, scored after just one minute and 33 seconds, was Man City's fastest goal ever in the Champions League.
Jesus, meanwhile, has found opportunities hard to come by this season but has still managed to score against Arsenal, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and now Real Madrid.
Kevin De Bruyne scored Manchester City's earliest goal ever in the Champions League, and it set his side up to control Tuesday's semifinal.
The wastefulness let Real Madrid off the hook while the visitors also benefitted from Guardiola's problems at right-back.
