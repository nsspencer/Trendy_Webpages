    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The supermarket, Mercadona, and the soccer club are corporate cousins.
Fernando Roig, Villarreal’s president and benefactor, has a minority stake in Mercadona, Spain’s largest retail chain, but it is his brother, Juan, the majority shareholder, who is credited with turning the latter into a staple case study for business schools around the world.
Central to that approach is the idea that the customers are ultimately in charge.
They are the ones, after all, who determine what their stores should stock.
To ensure the company is meeting their needs, Mercadona, every so often, invites a selection of its most reliable customers to take part in a testing laboratory.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City and Real Madrid begin their two-leg Champions League semifinal on Tuesday afternoon.
City are prohibitive -220 favorites on the three-way moneyline for the first leg, with Real Madrid coming back at +550 and the draw sitting with odds of +360.
While City have looked like one of the best teams in the world throughout their season, Real Madrid have achieved their results in a different fashion.
Los Blancos are runaway winners in La Liga, but their expected goal differential is second-best in Spain and suggests that Real Madrid is a bit fortunate to have such a big cushion over Atletico Madrid and Barcelona.
Manchester City takes on Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinals on Saturday.

     Raheem Sterling Raves About 'Special' Champions League Nights Ahead of Real Madrid Clash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Raheem Sterling claims Manchester City are 'focussed' on the Champions League because it is the one trophy the club have yet to win.
The England international was not shy in revealing his desire to finally win the Champions League with Manchester City.
Despite their failures in the competition, Sterling and his teammates have made immense progress since Pep Guardiola's appointment as manager in 2016.
Despite his recent dip in form - and some stretches out of the team - Sterling remains a staple in the competition in recent years.
Sterling could be a key figure in City qualifying for a second consecutive Champions League final.

     Summary: The Champions League is down to four clubs, two from the Premier League and two from La Liga.
Manchester City, Liverpool, Real Madrid and Villarreal will battle for control of the seas and see who can successfully circumnavigate the Champions League.
Of course, given how I've performed with my Champions League picks this season, maybe that's not a good thing.
He sent Real Madrid out there and had them playing like Sean Dyche's Burnley squad.
Then there's West Ham, who cannot reach the Champions League places in England, so their only route to the Champions League is by winning the Europa League (and look how well that path has worked out for Villarreal!).

     Summary: After two difficult spells at Arsenal and PSG, Unai Emery has transformed Villarreal and taken them to the brink of the Champions League final.
But 2006, the last time the Yellow Submarine reached the Champions League semifinal, was the more brutally iconic image.
Of course Roig's most iconic success came a year ago, again against Premier League and European behemoths.
Win, lose, draw -- Emery immediately sensed that there was urgency, ambition and grit about the Yellow Submarine project.
Yet he's the one, in the Yellow Submarine's words, ensuring that 'everyone of us, has all we need' for a Champions League semifinal against the six-time competition winners.

But it also proved that, when it comes to the Champions League, anything can happen.
ESPNAnd while there had been a total of eight comebacks from two-goal first-leg deficits in the Champions League before Barca stunned PSG, there have been six of them in the past five years alone.
The Champions League knockout phase has truly become a machine for generating stunning comebacks, so much so that we can almost half expect something extraordinary to happen over the next two weeks.
