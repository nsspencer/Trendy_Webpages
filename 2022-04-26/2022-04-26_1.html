     Champions League Semifinals: Manchester City vs. Real Madrid odds, pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City and Real Madrid begin their two-leg Champions League semifinal on Tuesday afternoon.
City are prohibitive -220 favorites on the three-way moneyline for the first leg, with Real Madrid coming back at +550 and the draw sitting with odds of +360.
While City have looked like one of the best teams in the world throughout their season, Real Madrid have achieved their results in a different fashion.
Los Blancos are runaway winners in La Liga, but their expected goal differential is second-best in Spain and suggests that Real Madrid is a bit fortunate to have such a big cushion over Atletico Madrid and Barcelona.
Manchester City takes on Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinals on Saturday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Its only European title came in 1970, when it defeated Polish side Górnik Zabrze for the Cup Winners’ Cup championship.
City and Real Madrid, who both lead their respective domestic leagues, met in the Champions League round of 16 two years ago, with the Premier League team winning both legs by identical 2-1 scores.
Liverpool still is in the running for an unprecedented quadruple, with a chance to win the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup.
Still, Villareal won the Europa League last year and has already beaten Juventus and Bayern Munich in the Champions League knockout round.
Despite being such a young franchise, this is RB Leipzig’s second semifinal appearance in a major European competition, having advanced to the final four of the Champions League in 2020.

     Summary: It is as though the club's first, and only, Champions League final appearance didn't happen at all.
- Mabert: Epic Champions League comebacks happening more often- How VAR decisions have affected every Premier League club- Don't have ESPN?
Chelsea took five years to reach a Champions League final following Roman Abramovich's takeover in 2003 and nine years to win it.
So there are no more excuses for failing to win the Champions League.
It was the same in Porto last season, which is probably why it remains such a sore subject, but after 14 years of investment and elite recruitment, it's time for City to deliver in the Champions League.

     Villarreal’s Eye for Value Cracked the Champions League Code
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The supermarket, Mercadona, and the soccer club are corporate cousins.
Fernando Roig, Villarreal’s president and benefactor, has a minority stake in Mercadona, Spain’s largest retail chain, but it is his brother, Juan, the majority shareholder, who is credited with turning the latter into a staple case study for business schools around the world.
Central to that approach is the idea that the customers are ultimately in charge.
They are the ones, after all, who determine what their stores should stock.
To ensure the company is meeting their needs, Mercadona, every so often, invites a selection of its most reliable customers to take part in a testing laboratory.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After two difficult spells at Arsenal and PSG, Unai Emery has transformed Villarreal and taken them to the brink of the Champions League final.
But 2006, the last time the Yellow Submarine reached the Champions League semifinal, was the more brutally iconic image.
Of course Roig's most iconic success came a year ago, again against Premier League and European behemoths.
Win, lose, draw -- Emery immediately sensed that there was urgency, ambition and grit about the Yellow Submarine project.
Yet he's the one, in the Yellow Submarine's words, ensuring that 'everyone of us, has all we need' for a Champions League semifinal against the six-time competition winners.
