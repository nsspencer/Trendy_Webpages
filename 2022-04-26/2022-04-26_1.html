     A Convincing Win That Was Anything but Convincing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The raw numbers of the game are not a magic eye puzzle; they are barely even a Rorschach test.
No matter how long and hard you stare at them, they will not suddenly become an image, clear and sharp, of something that bears analysis and interpretation.
They will certainly not tell him how Real Madrid manages to keep doing this, over and over again, seeming to draw strength as it comes ever closer to the edge, continually finding the will and the wit to conjure its curious, self-perpetuating magic.
Guardiola himself had acknowledged that before the game, half in jest, suggesting that there was not a vast amount of point in conducting the usual, instinctive analysis of Real Madrid because Ancelotti’s team is, by its very nature, so chimerical.
He meant it, most likely, as a reflection on the virtuosity of Karim Benzema and Luka Modric, the ability of some of the finest players of their generation to bend a game to their will, but it sounded just a little like he was saying Real Madrid does not make sense.

     Man City beat Real Madrid 4-3 in Champions League thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MANCHESTER, England, April 26 (Reuters) - After one of the greatest of Champions League semi-final clashes, Manchester City will take a 4-3 lead into the second leg of their tie against Real Madrid following an extraordinary encounter at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday.
But it is two games and we have another one in one week," said City manager Pep Guardiola.
It was the first time that 13-times European champions Real had conceded two goals so quickly in the Champions League and another looked on the cards.
Reigning Premier League champions City were on fire, running Spanish league leaders Real ragged, but Mahrez and Phil Foden were both unable to convert promising chances.
City, yet to be crowned European champions, were left with the strange feeling of disappointment at 'only' beating Real by one goal.

Advertising Read moreThe English champions could live to regret not killing off the 13-time winners after taking a two-goal lead three times.
But Karim Benzema's double and a brilliant individual effort from Vinicius Junior gave Madrid hope of another famous Champions League fightback at the Santiago Bernabeu on May 4.
Guardiola has often been criticised for overthinking his team selection at the business end of the Champions League.
And the City captain had a major role to play in two goals in two minutes at either end.

     Why Man City vs. Real Madrid was epic: What made 4-3 Champions League semifinal thriller an instant classic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the most incredible and memorable matches in recent Champions League memory unfolded at the Etihad as Man City topped Real Madrid 4-3 in the first leg of their semifinal matchup.
The match ended as the joint-highest scoring Champions League semifinal alongside two 5-2 results in 1995 and 2018.
7 - Man City 4-3 Real Madrid is the joint-highest scoring ever Champions League semi-final, along with Ajax 5-2 Bayern Munich (April 1995) and Liverpool 5-2 Roma (April 2018).
That was all Man City midfielder Bernardo Silva needed to produce a howitzer for a 4-2 Man City lead.
We probably shouldn't have been surprised this Champions League semifinal turned out like it did.
