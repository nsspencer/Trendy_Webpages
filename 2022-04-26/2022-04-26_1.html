     Summary: Its only European title came in 1970, when it defeated Polish side Górnik Zabrze for the Cup Winners’ Cup championship.
City and Real Madrid, who both lead their respective domestic leagues, met in the Champions League round of 16 two years ago, with the Premier League team winning both legs by identical 2-1 scores.
Liverpool still is in the running for an unprecedented quadruple, with a chance to win the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup.
Still, Villareal won the Europa League last year and has already beaten Juventus and Bayern Munich in the Champions League knockout round.
Despite being such a young franchise, this is RB Leipzig’s second semifinal appearance in a major European competition, having advanced to the final four of the Champions League in 2020.

     UEFA Champions League: Real Madrid conceding 4 in Manchester City loss shows why missing Casemiro is vital
    </h2>

     Summary: Based on Tuesday's evidence, scoring at least once at Santiago Bernabeu is not beyond Real Madrid.
They countered an onslaught from Manchester City impressively to emerge just one goal down after a breathless 4-3 first leg.
City go to Madrid a goal to the good in the UEFA Champions League semifinals after a wild opener at Etihad Stadium and it could easily have been over before it even started.

Maybe the South American's absence contributed towards the wild goal fest we were treated to in Manchester so we should not wish for a destroyer to be back in action and likely to limit the goals in Madrid.

(1:55)MANCHESTER, England -- Manchester City and Real Madrid played out a pulsating Champions League semifinal first leg at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday, with Man City earning the 4-3 advantage.
His goal, scored after just one minute and 33 seconds, was Man City's fastest goal ever in the Champions League.
Kevin De Bruyne scored Manchester City's earliest goal ever in the Champions League, and it set his side up to control Tuesday's semifinal.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The greatest gift Real Madrid has is its profound belief in its own capacity to win.
Again and again in the past decade in the Champions League, Madrid has found itself under pressure only for one of its brilliant players to do something brilliant just when it needed it.
The sense has been for a few years that La Liga sides can be physically dominated by Premier League teams.
Pressing was again the bedrock of City’s performance again here in what wound up tying for the highest-scoring semifinal match in Champions League history.
It missed opportunity after opportunity, although it won the shot count only 16–11 and the shots-on-target count only 6–5.

     Summary: With his cheekily dispatched “Panenka,” Karim Benzema might just have kept Real Madrid's chances alive against Manchester City in the semifinals.
City built a two-goal lead three times but just couldn’t shake off Madrid, the kings of the competition — as City manager Pep Guardiola calls them.
“We are all in this until the end.”With the France striker in its team, Madrid will never lose hope.
Without him, Madrid probably would not be still in with a chance of a record-extending 14th European Cup title.
Benzema had the final say, however, like he has so many times in this season's competition, and Madrid has renewed belief of reaching a first final since 2018.
