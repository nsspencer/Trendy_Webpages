     The Rams deserve an Oscar for a star-studded NFL Draft fake heist-movie trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I guess when you win a Super Bowl, you can make a wild, weird and funny mock movie trailer ahead of an NFL Draft when you don’t have a bunch of picks.
That’s what the Los Angeles Rams did on Tuesday, dropping a fake movie trailer that’s actually FANTASTIC.
— Stan Kroenke, Josh Holloway, Aaron Donald, Tyrese Gibson, Van Jefferson … yeah, it’s an amazing mix of Rams and movie stars.
“We’re going to steal the draft.” BRILLIANT!
I would pay to see what the Jets or Lions (“We’re going to bite some kneecaps!”) come up with.

     Rams drop “On the Clock” draft trailer featuring players and all-star cast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Rams dropped a trailer for the most anticipated event of the NFL offseason.
For a team that frequently says, “F them Picks”, LA is pushing the hype for the 2022 NFL Draft beginning this Thursday to the extreme.
The stakes have never been higher for a team that traded away their top draft picks last season.
“On the Clock” has my vote for Best Short Film at next year’s Oscars.
I won’t spoil anymore so please enjoy this masterpiece:I only hope next season’s Super Bowl video featuring the Rams is just as thrilling.

     LA Rams release amazing NFL Draft-themed faux heist movie trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams have been very active about trading away their NFL Draft picks.
As they’re not picking until the end of the third round, the Rams have some free time on their hands.
The Rams took the “when in Rome” approach and went all Hollywood, releasing a faux heist movie trailer called On The Clock: The House Always Wins, which features a bunch of Rams’ players and movie stars.
As far as this weekend is concerned, the Rams only have two of their original draft picks (fifth and seventh round).
That’s when they’ll look to pull off their plan and “steal the draft.”[Photo: Los Angeles Rams]

     Rams Drop Cameo-Filled Heist Video Ahead of 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rams are the reining Super Bowl champions, and they arguably just came out with the most epic social media move in NFL history before Thursday’s draft.
Leaning into their Hollywood skill set, the team released a high-budget movie trailer starring veteran actors along with its star players.
Star defensive tackle Aaron Donald is behind the team’s complex data analytics while wide receiver Van Jefferson gathers intel in, yes, a van.
Tyrese Gibson, one of the stars from the Fast and the Furious movie franchise, also stars in the video.
The Rams won’t have their first pick until the very end of the second round, but it’s clear they hope to come up with an absolute steal.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams don’t pick until No.
104 overall in the 2022 NFL draft, so they’ve had some time on their hands without the responsibility of studying first-round prospects bound to be selected on Thursday night.
Enough time, it seems, to put together a ridiculously cool movie trailer about the Rams stealing the draft.
The Rams released the trailer on Tuesday and it stars everyone from Aaron Donald and Matthew Stafford to Dennis Quaid and Tyrese Gibson.
There’s even a nice little nod to the Rams’ Super Bowl win from Professor Aaron Donald, if you caught it.

     Summary: Key scenes take place in the franchise's luxe Hollywood Draft House, unveiled last week as the successor to 2021's venue in Malibu.
The new location will serve as Rams HQ for various business during through the end of May.
Below, Rams execs Marissa Daly and Lexi Vonderlieth put us in the picture and discuss the project in detail:Muse: Why go the faux-action-flick trailer route?
We approach things a little differently from other franchises, as we invest in veteran players in exchange for our draft capital.
Lexi Vonderlieth, Rams VP of brand strategy: What we love about this trailer is that you don't have to be an NFL insider.
