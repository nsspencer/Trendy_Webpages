     Transnistria is just a sliver of land between Moldova and Ukraine. But it's becoming a focus of war.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Transnistria is a breakaway region that occupies a long, narrow slice of land alongside Ukraine and Moldova.
Moldovan government officials have long treated Transnistria with caution due to its close connections with Russia.
Experts say it's unlikely Transnistrians would join Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Transnistria is a literal powder keg, as it's home to a massive stockpile of aging Soviet-era explosives and ammunition.
Instead, it's taking place within the tiny European country of Moldova, at the border of the Russia-aligned territory known as Transnistria, which is home to an estimated 20,000 tons of Soviet-era weapons, ammunition and explosives, and more than 1,000 Russian troops.

     Summary: Russian-occupied area of Moldova blames Ukrainian militants for explosionsEnlarge this image toggle caption Ministry Of Internal Affairs Of Transnistria/AP Ministry Of Internal Affairs Of Transnistria/APKYIV, Ukraine — The president of Trans-Dniester, a Russian-occupied, self-proclaimed independent republic, says his government has traced recent attacks to Ukraine, according to Russian state media.
President Vadim Krasnoselsky has called on Kyiv to investigate what he calls the infiltration of Trans-Dniester by Ukrainian militant groups.
On Monday, the authorities in Trans-Dniester also reported a series of explosions at the Ministry of State Security.
The purpose, they say, is to spark panic and provide a potential pretext for mobilizing Russian troops in Trans-Dniester to attack Ukraine.
U.S. military officials doubt Russia has the military capacity to stretch its forces across the south of Ukraine into the Moldovan breakaway region.

     Summary: Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register"The traces of these attacks lead to Ukraine", Russian news agency TASS quoted Vadim Krasnoselsky, the self-styled president of Transdniestria, as saying.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy blamed Moscow, saying Russia was showing Moldova what to expect if it continued to support Kyiv.
Ukraine "condemns the desperate attempts to draw the Transdniestrian region of Moldova into the full-scale war against Ukraine," the foreign ministry said earlier.

Moldova's Sandu described the situation as "complex and tense," but said she had no plans to hold direct talks about it with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

     Moldova urges calm, boosts security after Transnistria blasts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ex-Soviet Moldova on Tuesday urged citizens to stay calm and stepped up security after a series of blasts in a Russian-backed separatist region raised fears of a spillover from the war in Ukraine.
“We urge citizens to keep calm and feel safe,” President Maia Sandu said after a meeting of the national security council.
She recommended stepped up patrols and vehicle checks near a buffer zone with Transnistria, tighter public safety measures and security checks on critical infrastructure.
It also said offices of the state security ministry in the main city Tiraspol were hit by what appeared to be a grenade-launcher attack on Monday evening, a public holiday for Orthodox Easter.
A senior Russian military official last week raised the issue of “oppression” of Russian speakers in Transnistria in the context of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine.
