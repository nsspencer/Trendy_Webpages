     About 120,000 pounds of ground beef recalled over E. coli fears
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadAbout 120,000 pounds of ground beef products sold to stores across the country were recalled Monday, federal food regulators announced, warning that contaminated meat could be in people’s freezers.
