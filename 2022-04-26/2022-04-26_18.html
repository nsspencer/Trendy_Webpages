    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An MRI on Tuesday on Utah Jazz star shooting guard Donovan Mitchell's left hamstring was negative, the team announced.

     Donovan Mitchell injury update: Jazz star has bruised quads; Utah reportedly optimistic he can play Game 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Utah Jazz announced Tuesday afternoon that All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell is dealing with bruising in both of his quads, and will receive treatment on them until Game 6 against the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday.
This comes after Mitchell left Game 5 Monday night with a hamstring injury, though the MRI on his left hamstring came back negative.
Mitchell landed awkwardly after trying to finish a drive at the rim, and immediately began grabbing at his left hamstring.
After the game, Mitchell said that his hamstring just tightened up.
Prior going out with the injury, Mitchell wasn't having the best game, putting up just nine points in Utah's demoralizing 102-77 loss.

     This Donovan Mitchell trade to the Cleveland Cavaliers weakens the defense too much

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Chris Gardner/Getty Images)Bleacher Report pitched a trade idea that sees Donovan Mitchell getting traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
The Cleveland Cavaliers are looking to rebound from a disappointing conclusion to their 2021-2022 season.
So when Bleacher Report’s Zack Buckley pitched the idea of the Cavs trading for Donovan Mitchell, you can imagine my surprise.
Maybe a team like New York would be improved by just adding a pure scorer but Mitchell isn’t a complete player.
I’m not saying no to Michell in Cleveland, I’m just saying no to this trade.

     Jazz’s NBA playoff mess hits new low with Donovan Mitchell injury in blowout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Jazz can thank the Nets for saving them from being the biggest bust of the NBA playoffs.
A hobbled Doncic has scored 63 points in the two games since his return, thanks to his other-worldly talent and a shoddy Jazz defense.
And now the Jazz might be without their own superstar, as Donovan Mitchell suffered a hamstring injury while playing into the fourth quarter of Monday’s blowout loss.
“They’ve scrambled extremely hard,” said Mitchell, who had nine points and missed all seven 3-pointers he attempted Monday.
Otherwise, the questions start anew about whether Mitchell and Gobert can co-exist and are capable of winning a championship together.
