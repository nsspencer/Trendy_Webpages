     Kevin Durant Claps Back At Charles Barkley: Fans React
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before Game 4 between the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets, Charles Barkley called out Kevin Durant while on Inside The NBA.
This comment was clearly directed at Durant, who won two championships with the Golden State Warriors.
Following the Nets’ season-ending loss to the Celtics on Monday night, Durant finally fired back at Barkley.
Instead of using his words, Durant simply posted a picture on Instagram of Barkley teaming up with Hakeem Olajuwon and Scottie Pippen in Houston.
https://t.co/fwkv8i9QYh — Rich Rozay (@finance_rich) April 26, 2022Of course, some fans believe Durant is wrong for posting this picture after the Nets were swept by the Celtics.

     Summary: Former Sixers star and current Inside the NBA co-host Charles Barkley believes the Sixers are in trouble in its first-round series against the Toronto Raptors.
With the series sitting at 3-2 heading into Game 6 on Thursday, Barkley did hold back when discussing where he sees this series heading.
"They're not going to win Game 6 in Toronto.
By the time they get to Game 7, there sphincters are going to be so tight.
Let's hope the Sixers aren't the first team to lose to allow this to happen, or things could get real ugly in Philadelphia.

     Nets news: Kevin Durant claps back at Charles Barkley with savage diss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets are out of the NBA Playoffs after getting swept by the Boston Celtics in four games.
By no surprise, Kevin Durant and Co. were roasted all over social media because of their collapse, especially since they had the best title odds of any team prior to the 2021/22 campaign.
The NBA on TNT panel always fires controversial opinions on different matters, especially Charles Barkley.
While Barkley recently explained what he meant by that and claimed he wasn’t trying to put down KD by any means, Durant didn’t forget.
However, Kevin Durant is clearly bothered by all the criticism.

     Summary: Charles Barkley didn’t hold back over the weekend when he sounded off on Kevin Durant after the Nets fell into a 3–0 hole in their opening-round playoff series against the Celtics.
Durant took to social media Tuesday morning following Brooklyn’s postseason elimination to make some pointed messages of his own.

When you’re the bus driver, and you have all that pressure when you have to play well or you’re going to get the blame.
"What happened when he was driving the bus?," Barkley asked.
He also was named the NBA Finals MVP when he scored 35.2 points per game in a series win over the Cavaliers.
Barkley nearly won a ring in 1993, but lost in the NBA Finals to Michael Jordan and Pippen in six games.

Barkley was asked about Durant’s greatness, and he was quick to diminish the accomplishments of the two-time NBA champion.
Barkley called Durant a “bus rider” and that unless you’re “driving” the bus, winning a championship means nothing.

     Summary: The Toronto Raptors are younger, fresher and deeper, readily exploiting their athleticism and versatility advantages now after a rough start to the first round.
This series shifts back north for Game 6, just one of the many reasons Sixers legend Charles Barkley virtually guaranteed another Raptors victory.
@tsn Charles Barkley says the Sixers have “no chance of winning” Game 6 in Toronto on Thursday.
Embiid’s injury and the Raptors’ much-improved approach on both sides of the ball changed everything, though.
Just imagine where the Sixers would be if Embiid’s buzzer-beating triple to win Game 3 had been off the mark.
