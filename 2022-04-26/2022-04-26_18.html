     Footage shows Alec Baldwin practising with gun before fatal shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Newly released footage shows the actor Alec Baldwin repeatedly practising drawing his revolver on the set of Rust on the same day a live round was discharged from the gun that killed the film’s cinematographer and injured its director.
Other footage includes the chaotic scenes shortly after the shooting, with officers trying to secure the scene – a church – after first treating the injured.
“Somebody put a live round in the gun,” Baldwin tells police in the footage.
In the footage, Baldwin is seen in closeup, whipping the gun out of its holster and aiming it in front of him twice.
“There was a bang that was louder than I ever heard come from a blank before,” Souza tells officers.

     Summary: Police release a trove of videos in the probe of the Alec Baldwin film-set shootingEnlarge this image toggle caption Jae C. Hong/AP Jae C. Hong/APSANTA FE, N.M. — Law enforcement officials released a trove of video evidence Monday in the ongoing investigation of a fatal October shooting of a cinematographer by actor and producer Alec Baldwin on the set of a Western movie.
A search for the gun leads to the movie production's armorer, who breaks down in tears.
Baldwin said the gun should have been empty for a rehearsal with no filming.
In the Oct. 21 video, Baldwin repeatedly says there were no prior problems of any kind with firearms on the set of Rust.
The bureau also documented gun safety complaints from crew members that went unheeded and said weapons specialists were not allowed to make decisions about additional safety training.

     Summary: Santa Fe County SheriffBaldwin and Halyna Hutchins, center, with other members of the production before the fatal shooting.
Josh Hopkins/InstagramA few minutes later, the actor is shown sitting with a few crew members and asking one of them for a cigarette.
A trove of other records, including crime scene photos, text messages and emails between crew members and footage from the film, were included in the release.
Santa Fe County Sheriff“[Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed] always wanted dummies in the gun and Alec never liked anything fake like guns and even the rubber knife.
The investigation into the shooting remains ongoing, and charges against crew members – including Baldwin – are yet to be ruled out, the sheriff’s office said.

     Summary: AdvertisementSo an information dump with little or no new information.
According to the sheriff’s department, the massive release was a response to continued requests for documents relating to the case.
In its volume and its lack of editing and redaction, the information dump is difficult not to see as something more than disclosure.
But given the involvement of Baldwin, the very public nature of the case and, well, the internet, there is also the issue of context.
Law enforcement too has protocols when dispersing information to the public, which include a duty to care for those involved in any investigation.

     Alec Baldwin's revelations to police hurt his case: experts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Police have released footage of an interview conducted with actor Alec Baldwin from October 2021.
“It’s not a good look for him.”During the approximately hour-long interview, Baldwin, 63, insisted that he was told that the Colt .45 he was handed was safe to use.
Things got strange when Baldwin told detectives about his wife’s response when he suggested having a gun in the house.
The OHSB report found that Rust Movie Productions had “willfully violated” a number of safety procedures and showed “plain indifference” to the well-being of employees and crew.
Whether or not Baldwin’s statements to police hurt him criminally, Ritter said they won’t help him with pending civil litigation.

     Summary: Here’s everything we know about the shooting and its fallout.
Rust’s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, told detectives she also checked the weapons to make sure they contained no live ammunition.
Members of the Rust crew have since spoken up about an allegedly high-stress and chaotic filming process.
“We were a very, very, you know, well-oiled crew shooting a film together, and then this horrible event happened,” he said, adding that Hutchins was his friend.
“That person is not Alec Baldwin.”The Rust Production company has been fined for lack of firearms safety on set.
