     Stranger Things Star Millie Bobby Brown Celebrates Her 18th Birthday In Style
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stranger Things fans have had a few reasons to celebrate in the last few days thanks to finally being told when they can expect to see the fourth season of Netflix’s hit show.
Today they were given another reason to swamp social media as Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown marked her 18th birthday.
The British star has packed more into her first eighteen years than many people do in a lifetime and has certainly come a long way in a short time thanks to her role in Stranger Things.
The post gained plenty of birthday messages from stars such as Paris Hilton, Spice Girl Emma Bunton, Kevin Pietersen and Stranger Things stars Matthew Modine and Noah Schnapp.
With Stranger Things Season 4 kicking off in three months’ time, and many other projects to come, there is still a lot more to come from the actress in the future, and we can’t wait to see it.
