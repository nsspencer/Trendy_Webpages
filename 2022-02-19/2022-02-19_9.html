     PITTSBURGH -- Former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores has a new home.
The Pittsburgh Steelers announced the hire of Flores, who is suing the NFL and three teams, as a defensive assistant and linebackers coach Saturday.
"I am excited about Brian Flores joining our coaching staff given his history of developing and teaching defensive players during his time in the NFL," Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said in a news release.
Despite the Steelers' hiring of Flores, his lawyer, Douglas H. Wigdor, issued a statement Saturday indicating the lawsuit against the league would proceed.
"While Coach Flores is now focused on his new position, he will continue with his race discrimination class action so that real change can be made in the NFL," said Wigdor.

     Pittsburgh Steelers hire Brian Flores after coach files racial discrimination suit against NFL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores is returning to the National Football League as the senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
His return to the NFL comes after Flores filed a federal lawsuit alleging racial discrimination against the NFL, the New York Giants and other teams earlier this month.
Douglas H. Wigdor, Flores’ attorney, released a statement saying, “We congratulate Coach Flores on his new position with the Steelers and thank Coach Tomlin and the organization for giving him this great opportunity."
"While Coach Flores is now focused on his new position, he will continue with his race discrimination class action so that real change can be made in the NFL,” Wigdor said.
He most recently served as the head coach for the Miami Dolphins between 2019 and 2021.
