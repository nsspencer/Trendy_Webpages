     AOC Accuses Tucker Carlson of 'Libelous Harassment' After 'Booty Call' Clip
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday accused Fox News host Tucker Carlson of harassment after his "booty call" segment in which he spoke about the congresswoman and a forthcoming book about her.
During his show Tucker Carlson Tonight on Friday, the host was discussing the upcoming book Take Up Space: The Unprecedented AOC, which is written by editors of New York magazine.
I genuinely want to know why Tucker Carlson is allowed/paid to engage in clear, targeted, libelous harassment that endangers people &amp;drives so many violent threats that ppl have to fundraise for their own safety.
On Friday night she shared a clip from Carlson's "booty call" segment and accused him of sexual harassment.
During the same segment, Carlson said that the New York Rep. is not a woman of color and called her "a rich, entitled white lady."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fox News host Tucker Carlson reviewed portions of a biography about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on his show.
Carlson said one excerpt from the book that referenced an Instagram Live broadcast was tantamount to "an invitation to a booty call."
Carlson called Ocasio-Cortez' comments "a little strange" and said she was "definitely oversharing."
Well now Tucker Carlson is wishing for… this on national TV," she tweeted.
In the same segment, Carlson said AOC was not a woman of color, calling her a "rich entitled white lady."

     “I don’t sense anyone in first class knew she was there or someone of her celebrity was there,” said the tipster.
A one-way first-class flight on American Airlines from Austin to New York City on Sunday runs between $400 and $600.
Economy passengers had to settle for snacks and non-alcohol beverages, while first class enjoyed full dinner service.
Back then at least, AOC used to fly coach.
Ocasio-Cortez spent last weekend in San Antonio rallying progressive troops in support of aspiring new “Squad” members.

     Campaigning AOC electrifies crowds as Democrats fear brutal midterms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ocasio-Cortez’s first campaign in 2018 was largely dismissed as a pipe dream, but the leftwing New York congresswoman is now impossible to ignore.
But to Ocasio-Cortez’s many admirers, her frequent clashes with Democrats and Republicans alike have set an example for a new kind of politics.
“Members of Congress of the progressive flank have raised expectations on Democrats broadly to deliver and prioritize people over profits.
Democrats now make up a majority of the Wichita city council, when they previously only held one of seven seats.
“Even though I didn’t win, her coming really energized our local Democrats in our community,” Thompson said.
