     Chris Schwegler/NBAE via Getty ImagesMinnesota Timberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns became just the third big man to win the NBA Three-Point Contest after taking the competition down Saturday from Cleveland's Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.
Eight NBA players took part in this year's competition, and here's a look at how it all went down.
Patty Mills (21) and CJ McCollum (19) briefly held finals spots alongside Kennard, but Towns and Young had other plans.
Towns had the longest odds to win the three-point contest, per B/R Betting.
This night also marked an emotional moment for Towns, who honored his mother, Jacqueline Towns, by wearing her necklace during the competition.

     Welcome to the modern NBA: Big man Karl-Anthony Towns wins NBA 3-Point shooting contest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CLEVELAND — In another sign how basketball has evolved, especially in the NBA, a 6-foot-11 big man won the NBA’s 3-point contest on Saturday.
"I said it on Timberwolves Twitter, I said it everywhere — the only way I’m going to lose this is if someone outshoots me.
If I'm going show up, I'm going to try to show out as well."
"There’s that flex forward slash center that’s more common now.
LaVine, McCollum and Young were the only players who had participated in the 3-point contest previously.

     Karl-Anthony Towns wins three-point contest with record score of 29
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Minnesota Timberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns demanded an answer as he bounded into the interview room following the 3-point contest at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Saturday night.
“Who bet against me?” Towns asked with an ear-to-ear grin.
Towns, thanks to a record-setting 29 points in the final round, emerged as the winner of the 2022 3-point contest, edging out Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young and LA Clippers guard Luke Kennard, who each put up 26.
Towns is the first big man to win the 3-point contest since Kevin Love in 2012.
At 6-foot-11, he is the second-tallest winner of the contest; Dirk Nowitzki, who is 7-0, won it in 2006.Source: Tim Bontemps @ ESPN

     Timberwolves’ Karl-Anthony Towns wins 3-Point Contest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Karl-Anthony Towns won the MTN Dew 3-Point Contest on All-Star Saturday, becoming the second Minnesota Timberwolves player and third big man ever to win the competition.
Timberwolves’ Karl-Anthony Towns wins 3-Point ContestWe asked the question earlier in the day on Saturday: why was Karl-Anthony Towns given the longest odds to win the MTN DEW 3-Point Contest on Saturday night?
He became the second Timberwolves player to win the competition, following Kevin Love’s 2012 victory.
He had a chance to eclipse 30 points but missed his last three shots on the final rack, watching the two-point money ball rattle out.
The Hawks star started out hot but ultimately needed to make every shot on the final rack.

     Long-shot Towns backs up his words by winning NBA three-point contest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CLEVELAND — Karl-Anthony Towns gave big men everywhere something to shoot for.
Golden State's Juan Toscano-Anderson was second as the dunk contest, once a marquee event that at times trumped the All-Star Game, fell flat.
A trio of Cleveland Cavaliers, Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, won the Skills Challenge.
After his surprising 3-point win, Towns accepted his trophy at mid-court and immediately turned toward Hall of Fame center Shaquille O'Neal sitting courtside in Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.
The dunk contest started with some promise and fizzled fast.
