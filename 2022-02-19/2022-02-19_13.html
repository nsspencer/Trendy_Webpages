     Family Dollar Recalls Contaminated Products After FDA Investigation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a public warning on Friday regarding potential contamination of several products sold at Family Dollar stores, a grocery chain acquired by Dollar Tree in 2015.
The alert came after FDA inspectors found unsanitary conditions, including a rodent infestation, at the company’s distribution facility in West Memphis, Ark., according to a release.
The affected products are sold at Family Dollar stores in six states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee,...

     Rodent Infestation at Family Dollar Warehouse Leads to Hundreds of Closures
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The value-store chain Family Dollar said on Saturday that it had temporarily closed more than 400 stores after the discovery of a rodent infestation and other unsanitary conditions at a distribution center in Arkansas touched off a far-reaching recall of food, dietary supplements, cosmetics and other products.
A recent Food and Drug Administration inspection of the facility, in West Memphis, Ark., found live and dead rodents “in various states of decay,” rodent droppings, evidence of gnawing and nesting, and products stored in conditions that did not protect against these unsanitary conditions, the agency said in a statement on Friday.
A fumigation of the facility last month revealed more than 1,100 dead rodents, and a review of company records indicated the collection of more than 2,300 rodents from late March to September, “demonstrating a history of infestation,” the agency said.
Rodent contamination can cause salmonella and infectious diseases, the F.D.A.
Families rely on stores like Family Dollar for food, medicine and other products, and those items should be safe, Judith McMeekin, an associate commissioner in the agency’s Office of Regulatory Affairs, said in the statement.

     Rodent Infestation at Family Dollar Facility Prompts Product Recalls at More Than 400 Stores

     Inside the building, inspectors said they found live rodents, dead rodents in “various states of decay,” rodent feces, dead birds and bird droppings.
The FDA said it is working with Family Dollar to begin a voluntary recall of affected products.
In a news release, Family Dollar listed the 404 stores that may have sold products from the contaminated facility.
“Family Dollar is notifying its affected stores by letter asking them to check their stock immediately and to quarantine and discontinue the sale of any affected product,” the company said.
“Customers that may have bought affected product may return such product to the Family Dollar store where they were purchased without receipt.”

     Family Dollar issues recall for various products after FDA inspection reveals rodent infestation at Arkansas facility
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued an alert that various products purchased within the last year from Family Dollar Stores across six states may be contaminated and unsafe to use.
Items ranging from dietary supplements and medication to cosmetics and pet foods may have been exposed to insanitary conditions at Family Dollar's distribution facility in West Memphis, Arkansas, federal officials said in a news release.
An FDA inspection found that a rodent infestation could have potentially contaminated the products.
"Family Dollar is notifying its affected stores by letter asking them to check their stock immediately and to quarantine and discontinue the sale of any affected product.
Customers that may have bought affected product may return such product to the Family Dollar store where they were purchased without receipt," the company said.
