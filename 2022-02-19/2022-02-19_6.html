     Daytona 500: Kaz Grala perseveres to make the field for Floyd Mayweather, The Money Team Racing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In the final laps of Thursday night's first Duel race, Kaz Grala and his race team found themselves on the ropes.
J.J. Yeley, the driver he was competing with for a spot in the Daytona 500 field, ran a lap ahead and seemed all but assured of making the field over Grala.
Grala's last lap pass, despite great adversity, was the sort of knockout punch on-brand for The Money Team Racing, a brand new Cup Series team owned by boxing great Floyd Mayweather.
After Grala makes his second Daytona 500 start on Sunday, The Money Team Racing will likely take a step back and compete sporadically as they build their program.
In addition to his Cup duties for TMT Racing, Grala will also run part-time in the Camping World Truck Series for Young's Motorsports in 2022.
