     11 Texas Tech Red Raiders it sounded like a 50/50 split, the No.
20 Texas Longhorns couldn’t pull off a late comeback in a 61-55 loss on Saturday, the second straight for head coach Chris Beard against the program he coached for five seasons.
A three by senior guard Andrew Jones with 1:36 left cut the Texas Tech lead to one, but Texas was never able to regain it, ultimately trailing for the game’s final 21:03.
With Texas guards applying pressure on the perimeter, Texas Tech emphasized getting points in the paint, out-scoring Texas 26-10.
As Beard lost again to his former assistant and Texas dropped a fourth straight game to Texas Tech in Austin, all he could do was crack a joke.
