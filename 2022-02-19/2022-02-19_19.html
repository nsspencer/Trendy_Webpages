     Arsenal moved one point behind the Premier League’s top four after Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka secured a 2-1 win over struggling Brentford.
The Gunners have two games in hand on fourth-place Manchester United with this victory putting them into a great position in the table.
After a first half of domination for Arsenal, they finally broke the deadlock just after the break thanks to Smith Rowe.
Mikel Arteta’s team would continue their pressure and then grabbed another goal as Bukayo Saka fired a powerful strike in off the post.

     Arsenal 2-1 Brentford: Smith Rowe and Saka nudge Arsenal closer to top four
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka were on target as Arsenal made it back-to-back Premier League wins with a 2-1 success over Brentford.
Smith Rowe took his tally for the season to 10 in all competitions with a fine individual effort in the 48th minute at Emirates Stadium.
And Saka secured the points for Mikel Arteta’s side when he drilled home with 11 minutes remaining, before Christian Norgaard's consolation in the dying moments.
Lacazette found Smith Rowe, who cut inside from the left before sweeping a low shot into the far corner.
But Raya was powerless as the Gunners put the result beyond doubt – Thomas Partey feeding Saka, who arrowed a powerful shot in off the far post.

     England duo Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka once again provided the goods as Arsenal beat Brentford to move within a point of the Premier League top four.
The win drew Arsenal level on points with West Ham in fifth and left them just a point off Manchester United, who occupy the final Champions League place.
Smith Rowe was recalled in the only change from Arsenal’s win at Wolves, replacing the suspended Gabriel Martinelli in Mikel Arteta’s side.

     Tottenham stunned City with a thrilling 3-2 win at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday, a result that gave Liverpool fresh hope in the title race.
Another former Liverpool star, Graeme Souness, felt Kane had shown exactly why clubs contending for honours like City want to buy him.
Liverpool play Chelsea in the EFL Cup final next week but Carragher feels the Reds should be even more enthused by the prospect of catching City.
"I'd still favour Man City [for the title] with Liverpool still to come to the Etihad and Liverpool's fixtures may be tougher.
"But there was a little bit of hope that Liverpool could do something, a glimmer of hope, when Man City dropped points at Southampton.

     It arrived three minutes after half-time through a sublime finish from Emile Smith Rowe.
Sergi Canós and Kristoffer Ajer both looked fearful of conceding a penalty and Smith Rowe wriggled between them, snaking a precise curling effort into the far corner via David Raya’s fingertips.
Brentford had begun to threaten in something approaching a concerted fashion but, straight after Yoane Wissa had squandered a promising position, Arsenal broke.

     With the results of our rivals mainly going our way of late, we knew a win here was imperative – and the way we started underlined that.
We immediately asserted our dominance and didn’t take the foot off the pedal throughout the first half, although we didn’t have anything to show for it.
With the electric Martin Odegaard pulling the strings, we spent the opening 45 minutes camped in the Brentford half and created a series of openings with our quick, one-touch attacking.
We continued to come forward as we looked to kill off the game, but Brentford remained stubborn opponents and began to push on themselves.
The full-time whistle we greeted with a big roar, as it signalled our second successive victory since the winter break and kept us firmly in touch with our top-four rivals.

     Ex-Arsenal wonderkid Yunus Musah has no regrets over dropping The Gunners and England for Valencia and US
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     FOR Yunus Musah, dropping England and Arsenal was an easy decision.
But with a professional contract awaiting his signature after playing an instrumental role in winning the U18 Prem title, Musah packed his bags and joined Valencia.
However, with Valencia handing a staggering 105 pro debuts to academy graduates in the last 30 years, Musah believes it was a no-brainer to leave back in 2019.
And just like he did with Arsenal, Musah wasted no time cutting ties as he jumped at the opportunity to follow Chelsea’s Christian Pulisic and Barca’s Sergino Dest in becoming a European-based US international.
Bai added: “I hope in the coming years we will have a few more Yunus’ amongst us.
