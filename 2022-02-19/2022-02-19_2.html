     French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel found dead in prison cell
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, a longtime associate of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, has been found dead in his prison cell, a spokesperson for the Paris prosecutor's office said.
Brunel was found alone, hanged with bedsheets, in his jail cell at the Santé prison in the French capital at around 1:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, the prosecutor's office told CNN.
Brunel's French lawyers told CNN their client's "decision was not guided by guilt, but by a sense of injustice."
"Jean-Luc Brunel has never stopped claiming his innocence.
Accused of rape by several former top models, which he denied, the 75-year-old was put under formal investigation in France in late June 2021 for "rape of a minor over 15," the prosecutor's office confirmed.

     They described his death as a double blow, after Epstein killed himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting sex-trafficking charges.
Paris police are investigating Brunel's death, the prosecutor's office said.
A frequent companion of Epstein, Brunel was considered central to the French investigation into alleged sexual exploitation of women and girls by the U.S. financier and his circle.
She also voiced concerns that Brunel's death mean his accusers won't get official recognition of their status as victims.
She expressed hope that Brunel's death won't discourage women from continuing to speak out about abuse.
