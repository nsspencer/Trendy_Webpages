    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     KANYE West claimed he "removed" Kris Jenner's "godless" boyfriend Corey Gamble from his daughter Chicago's birthday party last month.
The rapper previously shared an article on Instagram that claimed the matriarch's boyfriend "cheated" with a woman at a nightclub before removing the post.
The Yeezy founder shared an up-close image of Kris Jenner's much-younger boyfriend, along with a long and scathing caption.
All seemed to be worked out, however, when Kanye, Kris, and Corey, 40, were spotted heading to Saturday Night Live in October 2021 to see Kim Kardashian host the famous sketch comedy show.
