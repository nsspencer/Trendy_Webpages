     After standing on the court talking on his phone, UConn alum and Hornets guard James Bouknight was ejected during the Huskies' matchup vs. Xavier.
(0:51)STORRS, Conn. -- Former UConn star James Bouknight of the Charlotte Hornets was tossed from his courtside seat by a game official in the second half as the No.
Bouknight then moved to the UConn student section.
"That was not an ideal scenario because we were playing bad and kind of melting down a bit," UConn coach Dan Hurley said.
R.J. Cole and Tyler Polley both scored 16 points for UConn (19-7, 10-5 Big East), which has won four of its last five games.

     Hornets guard James Bouknight ejected from courtside seat at UConn game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former UConn guard James Bouknight was ejected from his courtside seat at the Huskies’ game against Xavier on Saturday afternoon, seemingly for using his cell phone.
The Charlotte Hornets guard didn’t exit Gampel Pavillion, but made his way into the student section behind the basket instead.
Bouknight was a First Team All-Big East honoree a year ago, leading UConn to the NCAA Tournament, where they lost to Maryland in the first round.
Without him, UConn has kept up the momentum from last season, with a 19-7 record after defeating Xavier 72-61 on Saturday.
It looks like a second straight NCAA Tournament berth appears assured for the Huskies, with Danny Hurley having turned the program around following a dry spell that came with Kevin Ollie’s ouster.

There’s just no stopping Bouknight from enjoying the game live and everyone in the arena loved it.
Bouknight is one of the best scores ever produced by the Huskies, even though he only played with them for two seasons.
As for Bouknight and the Hornets, they’ll resume their season on Feb. 25 at home versus the Toronto Raptors.

     With just over 13 minutes left to play, Cole left his seat on the bench to re-enter the game.
With just under 13 minutes left, Bouknight left his courtside seat — ejected from the game by referee Mike Roberts.
Worse, UConn had turned the ball over a whopping 10 times within the first seven minutes of the half.
“I think we let our guard down a little bit,” Hurley noted, “and just were too casual and weak.
“He didn’t get rattled by the last couple of games where the ball hasn’t found him and he hasn’t been as productive as he’s been at other big points,” Hurley noted.
