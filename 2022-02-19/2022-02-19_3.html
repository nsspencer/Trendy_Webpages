     "You know when you play Manchester City you will concede 70% of possession.
But Conte knows that one big result will be pointless unless they can produce a much higher level of consistency.
January signing Dejan Kulusevski, handed his first Premier League start, scored Tottenham's opening goal and impressed along with fellow new signing Rodrigo Bentancur.
Son set up Kane's first goal, the 36th time they have combined for a Premier League goal, equalling the record of Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard for Chelsea.

     'Special' Kane produced one of best Premier League displays against Man City – Carragher
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Harry Kane produced a "special" display against Manchester City that will be tough to match in the Premier League this season, says Jamie Carragher.
"Kane is one of the best passers of the ball in the Premier League, he's not far behind Kevin De Bruyne."
Liverpool play Chelsea in the EFL Cup final next week but Carragher feels the Reds should be even more enthused by the prospect of catching City.
"I'd still favour Man City [for the title] with Liverpool still to come to the Etihad and Liverpool's fixtures may be tougher.
"But there was a little bit of hope that Liverpool could do something, a glimmer of hope, when Man City dropped points at Southampton.

     Manchester City dropping points acts as a lesson for Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fast forward to February 19, 2022, and the Blues find themselves 13 points behind previously second-placed team Manchester City.
Man City though, sailed through the festive period with little to no issues that saw the Citizens ascend to the top spot.
The Reds kept their heads and continued winning games while Chelsea fans moaned that Man City was going to walk to the league again.
This result has more implications than just a struggling team nicking points off a Man City team in full throttle, showing the Manchester team’s vulnerability.
One lesson here is that the title race is not over until it is over.

     ✕ Close Match Preview: Man City vs Tottenham on 19/2/2022Man City host Tottenham in the late kick-off on a busy Saturday in the Premier League.
There were boos last time out for Spurs after defeat to Wolves, and Antonio Conte has been furious at the coverage and reaction to his interview with the Italian media, where he bemoaned the transfer situation after January, despite spending big to sign Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski, both from Juventus.
Spurs meet a City side in fine form after their demolition of Sporting in the Champions League this week, to all but secure their place in the quarter-finals following the one-sided first leg.
Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden and Raheem Sterling all enter this game in fine form and pose a huge threat to Spurs as they bid to keep alive hopes of a top-four finish.

     A dramatic finish saw Riyad Mahrez equalize for Man City before a late Harry Kane header sealed all three points for Tottenham.
(1:30)Harry Kane scored a last-minute winner as Tottenham Hotspur ended their dismal Premier League form with a 3-2 away win over Manchester City in a pulsating encounter on Saturday.
City pressed to find another equaliser and looked to have done so when Cristian Romero made a handball in the box, granting City a stoppage-time penalty.
Harry Kane netted a brace to help Tottenham Hotspur to a last-minute win over Manchester City.
Spurs move up to seventh, four points behind fourth-place Manchester United with two games in hand, as they continue their bid for Champions League qualification.
