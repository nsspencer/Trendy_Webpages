     Summary: The Lunar New Year is the most important annual holiday in China.
In Beijing, many worshippers offered morning prayers at the Lama Temple but the crowds appeared to be smaller compared to pre-pandemic days.
In Hong Kong, revelers flocked to the city’s largest Taoist temple, Wong Tai Sin Temple, to burn the first incense sticks of the year.
Worshippers believe those who are among the first to place their incense sticks will stand the best chance of having their prayers answered.
Local resident Freddie Ho, who visited the temple on Saturday night, was happy that he could join the event in person.
