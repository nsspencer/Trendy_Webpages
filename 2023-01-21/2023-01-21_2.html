     Cowboys vs. 49ers: Time, TV channel, streaming, key matchups, prediction for NFL divisional round playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's only fitting that the Cowboys and 49ers are closing out the divisional round of this year's NFL playoffs.
San Francisco has now won 11 straight, including the playoffs, after routing the rival Seahawks in the opening round.
But the reality is San Francisco is much more vulnerable defending the pass than the run; the 49ers finished 2022 ranked No.
Balance, of course, is always key, so Tony Pollard should still have a large role, especially in a game with a ball-control contender like San Francisco.
Few teams, if any, know how to scheme up -- and then execute on -- open lanes better than San Francisco.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fourth and final spot for Conference Championship weekend in the NFL is on the line on Sunday as we look for a Cowboys vs. 49ers pick in a rematch of last season’s opening round playoff game.
It’s true Prescott made more mistakes this year — his turnover-worthy play rate is double his career average — but Dallas’ offense is second in success rate when he’s on the field.
While the final box score from last week flatters San Francisco overall, it’s important to note how much that game was a toss-up until Geno Smith’s red zone fumble.
It was less than a month ago that Jarrett Stidham diced up San Francisco for a 61% success rate and 0.26 EPA per pass.
