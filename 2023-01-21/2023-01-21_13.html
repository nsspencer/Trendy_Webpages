     Juventus manager says team must maintain focus amid off-field turmoil
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri has urged his team to “do its duty” on the pitch after the Serie A side was deducted 15 points by an Italian soccer court on Friday, leaving it marooned mid-table.
The ruling, which deals a blow to the Turin club’s reputation, is tougher than the nine-point deduction a soccer prosecutor had requested during a hearing investigating Juve’s transfer dealings.
With 20 league games left to play this season, Juventus was third in Serie A with 37 points, 10 behind leaders Napoli.
The points deduction pushes it down to 10th place, outside the qualifying spots for lucrative European competitions.

     Juventus Deducted 15 Points As Former Club Officials Receive Bans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Maurizio Arrivabene, Andrea Agnelli, Federico Cherubini Juventus Football Director and Pavel Nedved ... [+] were all handed bans from football.
Getty ImagesNo sooner had Juventus appointed their new board this week, than the Bianconeri were back in the news after the Italian FA deducted them 15 points and handed out bans to a number of former club officials.
It stemmed from an appeal by Juventus against an investigation into inflated player transfer fees reported previously in this column.
Ultimately, that all led to Friday’s news that the club would be handed a 15-point deduction, as well as bans for the key figures involved.
Former President Andrea Agnelli and ex-CEO Maurizio Arrivabene were each handed two-year bans, while Sporting Director Federicio Cherubini was given 16-months.

     Juventus reeling after transfer trial disaster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Juventus are in deep turmoil after being hit with a massive points deduction for what the Italian Football Federation ruled was transfer trickery on the part of the country's biggest football club.
-- Juve were found guilty of managing capital gains from transfers to artificially benefit their balance sheet.
It was a charge of which they and other clubs including Serie A leaders Napoli were cleared by the FIGC tribunal last year after it was ruled it was impossible to pin down the objective value of a footballer.
However prosecutors at the country's football federation (FIGC) convinced the governing body's tribunal to reopen the sporting trial on the basis of evidence from a separate criminal investigation carried out in Turin.
Italian media report that Juve owe Cristiano Ronaldo nearly 20 million euros as part of that agreement.
