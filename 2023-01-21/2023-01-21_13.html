    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)Penn State Football: 3 Reasons 2023 is the year to make the CFP by Andrew AdairTwo recent Penn State Football standouts will battle for a chance to reach the NFC Championship on Saturday.
Penn State Football fans will be tuned in on Saturday night as Miles Sanders and the Eagles host Saquon Barkley’s Giant in the NFC Divisional round.
At Penn State, Barkley and Sanders were the top two running backs on the 2016 and 2017 teams.
Penn State Football used the success of these two Pennsylvania products to help win the recruitment of 5-star in-state running back Nick Singleton.
Now, Penn State will once again use this game as a recruiting tool for not only running backs, but all in-state recruits.

     Saquon Barkley Player Props
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ever the optimist, I’m going to instead focus on someone that should find success on Saturday and take a more positive approach with Saquon Barkley props.
Here is my best free NFL pick for Saquon on Saturday… along with a Barkley-based same-game parlay.
Unfortunately for him, the Philadelphia Eagles defense is an entirely different beast than Minnesota… and not in a good way, which means we should see a lot more of stud running back Saquon Barkley on Saturday night.
If I think Saquon’s going to put in some work in this game… then let’s bet on Saquon puttin’ in that work.
After scoring twice last week, Barkley has found the end zone in six of his last nine games and should continue to be the primary red-zone threat (and is always a potential home-run hitter).

     Best Saquon Barkley prop bets for Giants vs. Eagles in 2023 NFL Divisional round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After struggling with injuries over the last two seasons, New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley had a career renaissance this season.
Rolling up 1,312 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns on the season, adding another 338 yards through the air for good measure.
The Giants will be leaning on Barkey this week as underdogs in a playoff matchup against their NFC East rivals the Philadelphia Eagles.
Saquon Barkley prop bets for NFL Divisional roundUnder 66.5 rushing yards (-110)In his last outing against the Eagles, Barkley had just 28 yards on the ground in a game where his team was throwing the ball chasing points.
The problem here for Barkley is that we’ll likely see another situation where the Giants just don’t have the luxury of running the ball much.
