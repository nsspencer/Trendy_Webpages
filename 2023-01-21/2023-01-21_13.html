    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Premier League tie between Southampton and Aston Villa had to be suspended for 10 minutes after a drone was caught flying over the St Maryâ€™s Stadium.
The players were forced off the pitch and later returned to finish the first half with both sides tied 0-0 going into half time.
A drone enters the match between Southampton and Aston Villa, and the referee stops the match and asks the players to enter the dressing room.
The players were taken off the field by the referee in the 34th minute with the score at 0-0.
The players had then returned for a short warm-up and the match resumed after the drone was taken down.

     Southampton vs. Aston Villa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Southampton suffered a blow in their bid to avoid Premier League relegation as they went down 1-0 at home to Aston Villa in a match disrupted by a rogue drone on Saturday.
Moussa Djenepo came close to a late equaliser but Villa held on for a third successive away league win as their resurgence under new manager Unai Emery continued.
Southampton, who could have escaped the drop zone with a victory, remain bottom of the table with 15 points from 20 games.
Villa were the better side and although they had a let-off when Ward-Prowse's goal was ruled out, deserved the points.
Emery has now won five league games from seven since he replaced Steven Gerrard at Villa Park.

     Ollie Watkins scores late headed winner as Saints fume over Ward-Prowse disallowed goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You couldnâ€™t help but feel for struggling Saints who had TWO goals disallowed at St Maryâ€™s.
The first was a Kyle Walker-Peters tap due to being offside and then James Ward-Prowse was denied in the second-half by VAR drama.
It did the trick as James Ward-Prowse teed up Adam Armstrong whose low drive forced a blinding save from Emiliano Martinezâ€™s outstretched foot.
The goal was then chalked off and referee Michael Salisbury got an earful from seething Saints fans.
They responded with a free-kick floated in by Douglas Luiz to Watkins who flicked it coolly into the bottom corner.
