     Brandon Moreno UFC champ again after TKO of Deiveson Figueiredo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After Deiveson Figueiredo can't open his right eye, the fight is called and Brandon Moreno wins the UFC flyweight championship.
(1:11)The first tetralogy in UFC history came to a close on Saturday, as Brandon Moreno finished Deiveson Figueiredo in their fourth meeting in a span of 25 months.
A cageside physician waved off the flyweight title fight before the start of the fourth round, after Figueiredo's right eye closed from swelling caused by a Moreno left hook.
Figueiredo (21-3-1) reached for the right eye immediately after Moreno landed the left hook, protesting what he thought might have been an eye poke.
The doctor's stoppage result was the first time that has happened in a UFC title fight since Max Holloway defeated Brian Ortega in a featherweight title bout in 2018.

     Summary: Buda Mendes/Zuffa LLC via Getty ImagesBrandon Moreno won bragging rights and the UFC flyweight championship with a third-round TKO win over Deiveson Figueiredo in the fourth chapter of their storied rivalry at UFC 283.
The doctor stopped the fight between the third and fourth rounds after Moreno closed Figueiredo's eye with a one-two combination.
The third round was where Moreno landed the fight-changing blow.
The win gave Moreno the advantage in their series, which was tied at 1-1-1 after three epic fights.
At least Moreno had the benefit of fighting Kai Kara-France between his third fight with Figueiredo and the latest iteration of the matchup.
