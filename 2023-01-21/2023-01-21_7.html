     Saquon Barkley Says He Wants to Be a 'Giant for Life' Ahead of Contract Talks in FA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tim Nwachukwu/Getty ImagesNew York Giants running back Saquon Barkley's rookie contract is set to expire, but the former Penn State star made it clear Saturday that he wants to remain with Big Blue for life.
However, this was still a successful season for Barkley and the Giants.
Per Over the Cap, the Giants have the third-most effective cap space in football going into this offseason.
Ultimately, general manager Joe Schoen has a crucial decision to make regarding Barkley, but his renaissance season should get him paid somewhere in the league.
A second contract will be well-deserved for an exciting offensive talent who helped New York more than double its win total from last year.

     Giants' Saquon Barkley: Limited opportunity Saturday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barkley rushed nine times for 61 yards and brought in two of three targets for 21 yards in the Giants' 38-7 divisional-round loss to the Eagles on Saturday night.
Barkley's otherwise quiet night was highlighted by a 39-yard scamper on the Giants' only scoring drive, and his overall touches were limited by game script.
The talented back finished a resurgent regular season with 1,312 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns on 295 carries while also bringing in 57 of 76 targets for 338 yards, and he didn't lose a fumble across 16 games.
However, he logged just nine carries apiece in the Giants' two postseason contests, although he did score twice in the wild-card win over the Vikings.
Barkley is slated to become an unrestricted free agent at the start of the new league year, but given this season's results, there should certainly be interest in keeping him in the Big Apple.

     Summary: After struggling with injuries over the last two seasons, New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley had a career renaissance this season.
Rolling up 1,312 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns on the season, adding another 338 yards through the air for good measure.
The Giants will be leaning on Barkey this week as underdogs in a playoff matchup against their NFC East rivals the Philadelphia Eagles.
Saquon Barkley prop bets for NFL Divisional roundUnder 66.5 rushing yards (-110)In his last outing against the Eagles, Barkley had just 28 yards on the ground in a game where his team was throwing the ball chasing points.
The problem here for Barkley is that we’ll likely see another situation where the Giants just don’t have the luxury of running the ball much.

     Summary: Moments after his team's season-ending 38-7 loss to the Eagles on Saturday night, Saquon Barkley was asked about his future with the Giants heading into the offseason.
"I can't envision that being my last time in a Giants uniform," Barkley said following his team's divisional round playoff loss, via NFL Media.
This season, Barkley ran for a career-high 1,312 yards.
Alvin Kamara, Ezekiel Elliott and Dalvin Cook round out the list of running backs who make $15 million annually.
The Giants currently have the third-most cap space in the NFL and the most in the ultra-competitive NFC East.

Only three running backs (Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Ezekiel Elliott) are making north of $13 million per year.
If Barkley wants a contract that puts him among the league's highest-paid running backs, however, history says it might not be worthwhile for the Giants.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Giants shocked many by both making the postseason and winning a playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings.
Their surprising postseason run came to an end on Saturday against the Philadelphia Eagles, which creates some questions about the future of star running back Saquon Barkley in New York.
Barkley is set to become a free agent this offseason, and will likely command a pretty payday from whoever acquires his services next season.
“I wanted to show them the guy they drafted is still here,” Barkley said via Mike Garafalo on Twitter.
Giants fans will certainly be happy to hear these comments from Saquon Barkley, but there is very clearly much more work to be done from New York’s front office if they want to get a deal done this offseason.
