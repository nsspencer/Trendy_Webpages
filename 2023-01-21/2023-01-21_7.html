     Giants' Saquon Barkley: Limited opportunity Saturday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barkley rushed nine times for 61 yards and brought in two of three targets for 21 yards in the Giants' 38-7 divisional-round loss to the Eagles on Saturday night.
Barkley's otherwise quiet night was highlighted by a 39-yard scamper on the Giants' only scoring drive, and his overall touches were limited by game script.
The talented back finished a resurgent regular season with 1,312 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns on 295 carries while also bringing in 57 of 76 targets for 338 yards, and he didn't lose a fumble across 16 games.
However, he logged just nine carries apiece in the Giants' two postseason contests, although he did score twice in the wild-card win over the Vikings.
Barkley is slated to become an unrestricted free agent at the start of the new league year, but given this season's results, there should certainly be interest in keeping him in the Big Apple.

     Best Saquon Barkley prop bets for Giants vs. Eagles in 2023 NFL Divisional round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After struggling with injuries over the last two seasons, New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley had a career renaissance this season.
Rolling up 1,312 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns on the season, adding another 338 yards through the air for good measure.
The Giants will be leaning on Barkey this week as underdogs in a playoff matchup against their NFC East rivals the Philadelphia Eagles.
Saquon Barkley prop bets for NFL Divisional roundUnder 66.5 rushing yards (-110)In his last outing against the Eagles, Barkley had just 28 yards on the ground in a game where his team was throwing the ball chasing points.
The problem here for Barkley is that we’ll likely see another situation where the Giants just don’t have the luxury of running the ball much.

After scoring twice last week, Barkley has found the end zone in six of his last nine games and should continue to be the primary red-zone threat (and is always a potential home-run hitter).
