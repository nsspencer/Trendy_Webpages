     Saquon Barkley says he hopes to be 'Giant for life' as free agency looms following loss to Eagles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saquon Barkley is set to be one of the most sought-after free agents in the 2023 NFL class after his rebound season.
Everyone knows I would love to be a Giant for life, but I really can't give 100 percent answers.
Barkley set career-best marks in carries (295) and rushing yards (1,312), while scoring 10 times on the ground.
In 2021, Barkley rushed for 593 yards and two touchdowns on 162 carries and caught 41 passes for 263 yards and two touchdowns.
And we fell short," Barkley said.

     Saquon Barkley Says He Wants to Be a 'Giant for Life' Ahead of Contract Talks in FA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tim Nwachukwu/Getty ImagesNew York Giants running back Saquon Barkley's rookie contract is set to expire, but the former Penn State star made it clear Saturday that he wants to remain with Big Blue for life.
However, this was still a successful season for Barkley and the Giants.
Per Over the Cap, the Giants have the third-most effective cap space in football going into this offseason.
Ultimately, general manager Joe Schoen has a crucial decision to make regarding Barkley, but his renaissance season should get him paid somewhere in the league.
A second contract will be well-deserved for an exciting offensive talent who helped New York more than double its win total from last year.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moments after his team's season-ending 38-7 loss to the Eagles on Saturday night, Saquon Barkley was asked about his future with the Giants heading into the offseason.
"I can't envision that being my last time in a Giants uniform," Barkley said following his team's divisional round playoff loss, via NFL Media.
This season, Barkley ran for a career-high 1,312 yards.
Alvin Kamara, Ezekiel Elliott and Dalvin Cook round out the list of running backs who make $15 million annually.
The Giants currently have the third-most cap space in the NFL and the most in the ultra-competitive NFC East.

     Giants' Saquon Barkley: Limited opportunity Saturday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barkley rushed nine times for 61 yards and brought in two of three targets for 21 yards in the Giants' 38-7 divisional-round loss to the Eagles on Saturday night.
Barkley's otherwise quiet night was highlighted by a 39-yard scamper on the Giants' only scoring drive, and his overall touches were limited by game script.
The talented back finished a resurgent regular season with 1,312 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns on 295 carries while also bringing in 57 of 76 targets for 338 yards, and he didn't lose a fumble across 16 games.
However, he logged just nine carries apiece in the Giants' two postseason contests, although he did score twice in the wild-card win over the Vikings.
Barkley is slated to become an unrestricted free agent at the start of the new league year, but given this season's results, there should certainly be interest in keeping him in the Big Apple.

"I've been vocal about how I feel, where I want to be and where I want to stay.
Barkley set career highs in the regular season with 295 carries and 1,312 rushing yards, and his 10 rushing TDs trailed behind only his prolific rookie campaign.
"It sucks," Barkley told reporters in the team locker room.
