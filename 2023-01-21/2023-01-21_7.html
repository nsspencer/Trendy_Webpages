     Lakers News: Pundit Proposes Trading LeBron James For All-Star Hawks Guard
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Lakers All-Star power forward LeBron James has recently bemoaned the state of his club's roster depth.
David Aldridge of The Athletic proposes that one struggling Eastern Conference club might be interested in LBJ's services when he becomes trade-eligible this summer.
After trading for young two-way All-Star Dejounte Murray over the summer, the Atlanta Hawks expected to return to at least semi-contention in the 2022-23 season, behind a core of Murray, incumbent All-Star point guard Trae Young, well-compensated young power forward John Collins, and veteran rim-rolling center Clint Capella.
Instead, the Hawks have been an absolute mess, amidst chatter that basically the entire team dislikes Trae Young.
Aldridge proposes a LeBron deal centered around Murray and Collins (both of whom have not fit particularly well alongside Young).

     Summary: Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsIf you are a Los Angeles Lakers fan hoping the team can swing a big trade that makes a major impact on their season, you may want to have a more conservative outlook on roster changes ahead of the NBA trade deadline.
Despite changing their head coach and making the bold move to bench former NBA MVP Russell Westbrook, the Lakers have still struggled to build winning momentum in the 2022-2023 season.

     Lakers: Dennis Schröder Salvages Late-Game 122-121 LA Win Over Grizzlies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Westbrook helped the Lakers stay in the game with a well-rounded offensive outpouring, scoring from all over the floor.
Given LA's predilection for blowing late-game possessions of late, the contest looked to be firmly in hand for the opposition.
Ziaire Williams fouled Schröder almost immediately, and Schröder iced both his charity stripe takes to improve the score to 120-119.
The Lakers made just 40.9% of their shots from the floor (38-of-93), but critically took far more triples than their opponents.
With the victory, LA is now 21-25 in the West, still good for just the 13th seed.

     Summary: Dennis Schröder sneaked in from behind, slapped the ball loose and got the steal — maybe the biggest stop of the Lakers’ season.
