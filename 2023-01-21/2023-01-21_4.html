     Juventus hit with 15-point penalty for false accounting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Juventus, the record 36-time Italian champion, were hit with a massive 15-point penalty for false accounting on Friday (Jan.20).
A record 36-time Italian champion, Juventus was third in Serie A and the penalty drops the Bianconeri to a midtable position — 25 points behind leader Napoli and 12 points from the Champions League places.
Prosecutors had previously recommended a nine-point deduction over the scandal, in which the club were alleged to have falsely inflated the value of players and misrepresented losses.
The penalty comes 17 years after a refereeing scandal that saw Juventus demoted to Serie B and stripped of two Serie A titles.
Juventus hosts Atalanta in the league on Sunday (Jan.22).

     Juventus Deducted 15 Points As Former Club Officials Receive Bans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Maurizio Arrivabene, Andrea Agnelli, Federico Cherubini Juventus Football Director and Pavel Nedved ... [+] were all handed bans from football.
Getty ImagesNo sooner had Juventus appointed their new board this week, than the Bianconeri were back in the news after the Italian FA deducted them 15 points and handed out bans to a number of former club officials.
It stemmed from an appeal by Juventus against an investigation into inflated player transfer fees reported previously in this column.
Ultimately, that all led to Friday’s news that the club would be handed a 15-point deduction, as well as bans for the key figures involved.
Former President Andrea Agnelli and ex-CEO Maurizio Arrivabene were each handed two-year bans, while Sporting Director Federicio Cherubini was given 16-months.
