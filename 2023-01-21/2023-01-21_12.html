     Summary: Kay Murray and Luis Miguel Echegaray praise Mykhailo Mudryk's performance after he came off the bench to make his Chelsea debut vs. Liverpool.
(1:25)Forward Kai Havertz saw an early goal ruled out by VAR as Chelsea and Liverpool played out a goalless draw at Anfield on Saturday.
Both sides are nine points off the top four with Chelsea having played 20 games to Liverpool's 19.
Overall, we controlled a lot of it ... We could have taken our chances," Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount said after the match.
There's things to work on but a clean sheet is a step in the right direction," Liverpool defender James Milner said.

     Liverpool and Chelsea draw 0-0 to hit Champions League hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A season of frustration continued for Liverpool and Chelsea after a 0-0 draw at Anfield on Saturday did little to help either team’s hopes of securing Champions League qualification next season.
Benoit Badiashile and substitute Carney Chukwuemeka had opportunities to score in each half for Chelsea, but neither was clinical enough to make Liverpool pay.
Klopp’s Liverpool reign has seen the storied club re-establish itself as one of the best teams in Europe.
It’s a similar story for Chelsea, which has now won just two of its last 10 games in all competitions.
The two teams were ninth and 10th in the standings going into the game, with Liverpool ahead on goal difference.

     Liverpool and Chelsea play out stalemate, Everton woes continue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All three sides are nine points off the top four, with Chelsea having played 20 games to Liverpool and Brentford's 19 apiece.
Liverpool have failed to win any of their last three league games, while it is the first time they have failed to score in consecutive matches in the competition since March 2021.
Chelsea are now without a win in their last six league games on the road, their longest comparable run in the competition since September-December 2015.
They have collected just 15 points from their 20 league this season -- their fewest points won after 20 games of any league campaign in their history.
They have 39 points and are third on goal difference ahead of Manchester United, who play leaders Arsenal on Sunday.

     How Liverpool and Chelsea played out a goalless draw as Mudryk makes Premier League debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mykhailo Mudryk was a rare bright spark on his Chelsea debut in an otherwise drab affair at Anfield, which ended goalless.
In a scrappy affair, it was evident that both sides were lacking confidence.
Yet, Chelsea remained marginally better in the first half while Liverpool gradually found their footing in the latter stages of the opening 45 minutes.
Albeit brief, the most eye-catching performance in the game was from Chelsea's latest prize signing, Mudryk, who came on as a substitute with 35 minutes left to play.
Ultimately, neither team were able to break the deadlock and the draw leaves both sides well short of the top four.

     Klopp Grateful for Small Step After Liverpool-Chelsea Draw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now Liverpool sits eighth in the league — Chelsea is 10th — and belongs there after three games without a win.
I expect progress and I think from the last league game (a 3-0 loss against Brighton) it was progress, definitely, and that’s important.”There are several factors behind Liverpool’s sudden decline.
Villa's rise under manager Unai Emery extended to five wins in the Spaniard’s seven league games in charge, with only one defeat.
The Magpies also failed to capitalize on the draw between Liverpool and Chelsea earlier in the day by widening the gap on them.
Still, the point extended Newcastle’s unbeaten run in the league to 15 games since defeat to Liverpool in August.
