     Summary: Drone Stops Play In Premier League Game Between Southampton And Aston VillaSaturday's Premier League game between Southampton and Aston Villa was suspended during the first half after a drone was flown over the pitch.
The drone arrived on the scene 40 minutes into the game as Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz was preparing to take a free-kick.
After speaking to both captains, referee Michael Salisbury decided to halt play and send all 22 players back to the locker rooms.
Play resumed 10 minutes later.
Villa won the game 1-0 courtesy of a 77th-minute goal from Ollie Watkins.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Premier League tie between Southampton and Aston Villa had to be suspended for 10 minutes after a drone was caught flying over the St Maryâ€™s Stadium.
The players were forced off the pitch and later returned to finish the first half with both sides tied 0-0 going into half time.
A drone enters the match between Southampton and Aston Villa, and the referee stops the match and asks the players to enter the dressing room.

The players had then returned for a short warm-up and the match resumed after the drone was taken down.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Southampton suffered a blow in their bid to avoid Premier League relegation as they went down 1-0 at home to Aston Villa in a match disrupted by a rogue drone on Saturday.
Moussa Djenepo came close to a late equaliser but Villa held on for a third successive away league win as their resurgence under new manager Unai Emery continued.
Southampton, who could have escaped the drop zone with a victory, remain bottom of the table with 15 points from 20 games.
Villa were the better side and although they had a let-off when Ward-Prowse's goal was ruled out, deserved the points.
Emery has now won five league games from seven since he replaced Steven Gerrard at Villa Park.
