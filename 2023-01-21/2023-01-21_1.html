     Lakers Highlights: Russell Westbrook Scorers Season-High &amp; Dennis Schroder Completes Comeback Over Grizzlies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was the Lakers’ second win in three games and snapped Memphis’ 11-game win streak.
For most of the game, it felt like the Lakers’ failures to match the size, athleticism and physicality of the Grizzlies would cost them.
The Grizzlies out-rebounded the Lakers 63 to 47 including 24 offensive rebounds, which led to 39 second-chance points.
Most notable was their advantage in transition as the Lakers outscored Memphis 20 to four in fast break points.
Russell Westbrook poured in a season-high 29 points to lead the way, however, to go along with six assists and five rebounds.

     Russell Westbrook wanted to guard Ja Morant at end of Lakers win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unlike Ja Morant (according to Shannon Sharpe), Russell Westbrook wanted the smoke.
Throughout the cold night for both clubs, the Lakers relied on scrappy defense, keeping the Grizzlies to 42.2% shooting.
In the two biggest moments of the game, the Lakers swung the outcome with back-to-back big-time stops by a point guard.
Los Angeles’ combination of perimeter pests (Schroder, Westbrook, Patrick Beverley) had collectively held the Grizzlies superstar to 9-0f-28 shooting up to that point.
“Russ’ defense on Ja Morant at the end — it was great,” said Ham.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Memphis Grizzlies blew a chance to make history Friday night in Los Angeles.
They blew a chance to get the last laugh after Shannon Sharpe made a fool of himself courtside.
Memphis could set the franchise record for regular-season wins it tied a year ago (56), and it could be the No.
The only thing more bizarre than the incident itself is that Sharpe didn't get removed from the arena like a regular fan would have instigating in that manner.
“We didn’t play to our standard,” Jenkins said.

     Summary: Los Angeles Lakers coach Darvin Ham hailed "one of those great, great nights" as his team halted the Memphis Grizzlies' 11-game winning streak.
The Lakers pulled off a 122-121 victory, with a crucial late steal by Dennis Schroder pivotal to the outcome.
The Lakers are now 21-25 for the season, with reports saying Anthony Davis should be back from injury next week.
Looking at the key to getting the big win on Friday night in Los Angeles, Ham said: "I just think our resolve.
It was just one of those great, great nights and a hell of a game.
