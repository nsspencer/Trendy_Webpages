Juventus deducted 15 pointsDrop down to tenth in Serie AMultiple ex-board members face bansWHAT HAPPENED?
Juventus are yet again engulfed in scandal having been deducted 15 points in Serie A for 'financial irregularities' and 'false accounting' in relation to past transfer dealings.
Former chairman and European Super League advocate, Andrea Agnelli, who stepped down last November, has been banned from holding office in Italian football for 24 months, while Pavel Nedved has been banned for eight months.
Italian prosecutors took umbrage with several of Juventus' dealings, including the now-infamous swap deal with Barcelona involving midfieldersArthur and Miralem Pjanic.

     Serie A: Italian giants Juventus slipped to 10th spot after points deduction amid latest controversy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Juventus' troubled start to the new year slipped into disaster on Friday after the Italian Football Federation docked the Serie A giants 15 points for using transfers to artificially boost their balance sheet.
Juventus drop down from third to 10th place on just 22 points, 15 from the top four positions in Italy's top flight.
Missing out on Europe's top -- and richest -- club competition would be a further blow to the club's accounts which last season were nearly 239 million euros in the red.
Juventus recorded a capital gain of 43 million euros on Pjanic, the second highest in the club's history.
Juventus will know after a preliminary hearing in March if they and the former members of the club's board will stand criminal trial over alleged false accounting.

     Juventus docked 15 points in Serie A by Italian federation for false accounting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Juventus were hit with a 15-point penalty for false accounting on Friday following an appeal hearing at the Italian football federation.
But an appeal was made after the federation collected papers from the Turin prosecutors.
Juventus can appeal the decision to Italy’s highest sports court within the Italian Olympic Committee.
The news comes 17 years after the “Calciopoli” refereeing scandal that resulted in Juventus, record 36-time Italian champions, being demoted to Serie B and stripped of two Serie A titles.
Turin prosecutors have also apparently discovered more alleged secret payments to former player Cristiano Ronaldo that were not reported by Juventus.

     Summary: Juventus have been deducted 15 points for the current season by an Italian court investigating the club’s transfer dealings, leaving the country’s most successful team marooned in mid-table.
With 20 games left to play this season, Juve were third in Serie A with 37 points, 10 behind leaders Napoli.
In a late night statement, the court also imposed bans from holding office in Italian football on 11 past and present Juventus directors.
CASE REOPENEDThe ruling reversed a previous decision in April to clear Juventus, 10 other clubs and their executives of wrongdoing.
Public prosecutors in Turin have requested Andrea Agnelli, 11 other people and the club itself to stand trial over allegations of false accounting.
