     Retired astronaut Buzz Aldrin marries ‘longtime love’ on his 93rd birthday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin, who became the second person to ever set foot on the moon in 1969, following crewmate Neil Armstrong, married his “longtime love” on his 93rd birthday on Friday.
“On my 93rd birthday &amp; the day I will also be honored by Living Legends of Aviation I am pleased to announce that my longtime love Dr. Anca Faur &amp; I have tied the knot,” Aldrin wrote.
In July 1969, mission commander Armstrong, lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin, and command module pilot Michael Collins blasted off in Apollo 11 on a nearly 250,000-mile journey to the moon.
Armstrong was on the moon’s surface for two hours and 32 minutes and Aldrin, who followed him, spent about 15 minutes less than that.
The two astronauts set up an American flag, scooped up moon rocks, and set up scientific experiments before returning to the spacecraft.
