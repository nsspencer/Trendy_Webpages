     Summary: Graham Potter makes one change to his Chelsea team for today’s game at Liverpool, with Mykhailo Mudryk named on the bench.
Liverpool vs Chelsea lineupsMarc Cucurella comes into the side in place of Carney Chukwuemeka, with the possibility Lewis Hall will play in a more advanced role than he did against Crystal Palace.
Thiago Silva and Benoit Badiashile resume their defensive partnership that kept a clean sheet, with Mason Mount and Hakim Ziyech expected to support Kai Havertz in attack.
Mudryk is on the subs’ bench for the first time after Graham Potter said yesterday he would likely have a role to play at some point.
Chelsea: Kepa, Chalobah, Badiashile, Thiago Silva, Cucurella, Jorginho (c), Gallagher, Ziyech, Mount, Hall, Havertz.

     How Liverpool and Chelsea played out a goalless draw as Mudryk makes Premier League debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mykhailo Mudryk was a rare bright spark on his Chelsea debut in an otherwise drab affair at Anfield, which ended goalless.
In a scrappy affair, it was evident that both sides were lacking confidence.
Yet, Chelsea remained marginally better in the first half while Liverpool gradually found their footing in the latter stages of the opening 45 minutes.
Albeit brief, the most eye-catching performance in the game was from Chelsea's latest prize signing, Mudryk, who came on as a substitute with 35 minutes left to play.
Ultimately, neither team were able to break the deadlock and the draw leaves both sides well short of the top four.
