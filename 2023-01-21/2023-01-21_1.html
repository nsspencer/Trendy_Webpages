Juventus are yet again engulfed in scandal having been deducted 15 points in Serie A for 'financial irregularities' and 'false accounting' in relation to past transfer dealings.
Former chairman and European Super League advocate, Andrea Agnelli, who stepped down last November, has been banned from holding office in Italian football for 24 months, while Pavel Nedved has been banned for eight months.
Italian prosecutors took umbrage with several of Juventus' dealings, including the now-infamous swap deal with Barcelona involving midfieldersArthur and Miralem Pjanic.

     Juventus hit with 15-point penalty for false accounting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Juventus, the record 36-time Italian champion, were hit with a massive 15-point penalty for false accounting on Friday (Jan.20).
A record 36-time Italian champion, Juventus was third in Serie A and the penalty drops the Bianconeri to a midtable position — 25 points behind leader Napoli and 12 points from the Champions League places.
Prosecutors had previously recommended a nine-point deduction over the scandal, in which the club were alleged to have falsely inflated the value of players and misrepresented losses.
The penalty comes 17 years after a refereeing scandal that saw Juventus demoted to Serie B and stripped of two Serie A titles.
Juventus hosts Atalanta in the league on Sunday (Jan.22).
