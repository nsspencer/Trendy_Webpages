     Tony Dungy apologizes for controversial cat litter tweet that sparked outrage and backlash
    </h2>

     Summary: Seriously, Tony Dungy?
"Some school districts are putting litter boxes in the school bathrooms for students who identify as cats.
By 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Dungy deleted his cat litter tweet which was in response to a Daily Wire video showing Minnesota State Rep. Sandra Feist advocating for menstrual items in boys' school bathrooms.
Dungy's response created some outrage as the cat litter story was debunked months ago after being spread by political conservatives who oppose LGBTQ+ rights and gender nonconformity.
Dungy, who currently serves as a television analyst, is known for his Christian faith and often conservative views, especially on social values.

     Tony Dungy Issues Apology for Tweet Promoting Anti-Transgender Rhetoric
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former NFL coach and NBC analyst Tony Dungy issued an apology after he received backlash this week for posting a controversial tweet from his personal account that promoted anti-transgender rhetoric.
In the since-deleted tweet, Dungy responded to a video from The Daily Wire showing Minnesota state representative Sandra Feist advocating for menstrual products to be placed in boys’ school bathrooms across the state.
Dungy said in his post that school districts across the country were “putting litter boxes in school bathrooms for students who identify as cats.”This myth has been widely debunked, including by NBC News and PolitiFact.
Dungy claimed that he had apologized previously but “not everyone saw it,” so he issued a brief statement on the matter on social media Saturday afternoon.
“I saw a tweet yesterday and I responded to it in the wrong way,” Dungy wrote on Twitter.
