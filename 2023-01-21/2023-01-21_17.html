     Summary: Atlanta protest over police killing of activist turns violentEnlarge this image toggle caption R.J. Rico/AP R.J. Rico/APATLANTA — A protest turned violent in downtown Atlanta on Saturday night in the wake of the death of an environmental activist who was killed this week after authorities said the 26-year-old activist shot a state trooper.
Masked activists dressed in all black threw rocks and lit fireworks in front of a skyscraper that houses the Atlanta Police Foundation, shattering large glass windows.
They then lit a police car on fire and vandalized other buildings with anti-police graffiti as stunned tourists scattered.
The violent protesters were a subsection of hundreds of demonstrators who had gathered and marched up Atlanta's famed Peachtree Street to mourn the death of the protester, a nonbinary person who went by the name Tortuguita and used they/it pronouns.
"Violence and unlawful destruction of property are not acts of protest," the Republican governor tweeted.

     6 arrested after Atlanta protests over controversial ‘Cop City’ and fatal police shooting of activist
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Six people were arrested Saturday evening in downtown Atlanta, authorities said, during protests that came in response to a proposed police training facility and the fatal police shooting of an activist earlier in the week.
Police arrested six people and were continuing to investigate whether there were any others involved in illegal activity, the chief said.
The protests come in response to a planned $90 million, 85-acre law enforcement training facility – dubbed “Cop City” by its opponents – and just days after the police killing of a 26-year-old activist near the site of the training center.
A controversial facilityThe Atlanta Police Foundation has said the planned training center is needed to help boost morale and recruitment efforts, and previous facilities used by law enforcement are substandard.
But the facility, which will include a shooting range, mock city and burn building, has been met with fierce resistance.
