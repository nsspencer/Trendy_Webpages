     West Ham United vs Everton Odds, Pick, Prediction: Both Sides Will Play With Desperation

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: West Ham host Everton in what already feels like a season-defining match between two teams at the bottom of the table in London Stadium on Saturday morning.
Here is our breakdown of the West Ham vs. Everton odds, and my pick for Saturday.
West Ham Need a Change in FortuneNot many predicted West Ham would be where they are in the table at this point in the season, given their success over the last couple of years.
Perhaps we don’t see a change in fortunes occur this weekend, as West Ham haven’t recorded a point at home since late October, but it is safe to assume that positive regression is on the horizon for the Hammers.

     Everton falls to another bottom-half side as West Ham gets big win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jarrod Bowen scored a pair of first-half goals and posted a memorable celebration as West Ham beat Everton 2-0 at London’s Olympic Stadium on Saturday.
The Toffees had a lot of the ball — just under 70 percent for the game — but that’s a bit misleading given West Ham was happy to counter once ahead 2-0.
Everton lost the xG battle 2.33-0.67 and was out-attempted 11-5.
And what would West Ham be without Rice?
