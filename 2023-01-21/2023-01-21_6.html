     Brian Daboll’s final message to Daniel Jones, Giants after rough loss to Eagles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is exactly the message he sent to the team following their 38-7 loss to the Eagles, emphasizing that they should still be proud of what they have accomplished.
It’s really hard to do,” Daboll revealed when asked what he told the team following their painful loss, per Mike Garafolo of NFL Network.
Only Matt Breida was able to score for the Giants, with Daniel Jones unable to find a target at the end zone.
It was really far from their performance against the Minnesota Vikings in the Wild Card round, where Jones and Barkley scored two touchdowns each.
But as Brian Daboll said, there’s no denying the team can be proud of what they have done.

     Brian Daboll doesn't commit to Daniel Jones as Giants' 2023 QB after playoff loss to Eagles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By all accounts, Daniel Jones took significant strides and won over his teammates as the Giants' quarterback in 2022.
Asked after Saturday's playoff loss to the Eagles whether he expects Jones back in 2023, Daboll was decidedly noncommittal.
The two sides were reportedly close on a contract extension prior to the Giants' playoff debut, but as of now, Jones remains unsigned beyond this season.
Daboll, for what it's worth, also downplayed Jones' growth in his postgame remarks, suggesting Jones has been "a consistent guy since he's been here."
When asked to assess the QB's individual performance against the Eagles, he was also tepid.

     Summary: 1 seed Philadelphia Eagles on Saturday night, the New York Giants needed to have all hands on deck.
During New York's third possession, the Giants would have to call a timeout.
Was there some sort of defensive alignment Jones didn't like seeing?
Entering this divisional-round matchup, bettors didn’t necessarily expect Jones to continue lighting up the Eagles the way he did the Vikings.
And with the Giants down 28-0 after 30 minutes, it was clear that Saturday was an all-around nightmare day for them.

     Daniel Jones’ rapid rise changes things for the Giants
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA — Daniel Jones had just made history in his playoff debut, and one of the most thoughtful voices around, Giants teammate Darius Slayton, was explaining why it came as no surprise.
“One thing you’ve got to understand about Daniel Jones,” Slayton said, “is he tries his very, very hardest to win these games.
If the Giants are forced to slightly overpay Jones, or to overpay him outright, well, there are worse things in the world.
But Jones is a money player who clearly isn’t motivated (at least not primarily) by the money.
Jones won the respect of everyone who cares about Giants football, and nobody could take that away from him Saturday night in Philly — win or lose.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Had the Giants season ended there, perhaps the franchise would stay the course with quarterback Daniel Jones, because by most accounts the team was finally trending in the right direction after almost a decade of ineptitude.
At the end of the regular season, a new contract for Daniel Jones seemed inevitable.
What a sequence: Daniel Jones runs out of bounds to lose 5 yards on 2nd down, throws an incomplete pass on 3rd down, and then Daboll punts on 4th and 6 with 13 minutes left in the game down 21.
Have either one (or both) played their final games with the New York Giants?
Or should the Giants consider rewarding and building around the 26-year-old Saquon Barkley, now finally healthy and productive again?
