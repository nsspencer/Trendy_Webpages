    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the game, Mahomes said there is no official prognosis and insisted he will be good to go for the AFC Championship game.

Mahomes was limping and hobbled to the sideline, but remained in the game for the time being, eventually getting his ankle taped.
Before going out with the injury, Mahomes was 12 of 15 for 84 yards and one touchdown.
He finished the game going 22-for-30 with 195 yards, two touchdowns, a completion percentage of 73.3 and a 112.5 passer rating.
