     Summary: Atlanta protest over police killing of activist turns violentEnlarge this image toggle caption R.J. Rico/AP R.J. Rico/APATLANTA — A protest turned violent in downtown Atlanta on Saturday night in the wake of the death of an environmental activist who was killed this week after authorities said the 26-year-old activist shot a state trooper.
Masked activists dressed in all black threw rocks and lit fireworks in front of a skyscraper that houses the Atlanta Police Foundation, shattering large glass windows.
They then lit a police cruiser on fire, smashed more windows and vandalized walls with anti-police graffiti as stunned tourists scattered.
"Violence and unlawful destruction of property are not acts of protest," the Republican governor tweeted.
Seven people were arrested and charged with domestic terrorism and criminal trespass, with other charges pending, the GBI said.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said the incident was not recorded on body cameras, the AP reported.

Police are still assessing whether they need to make more arrests over broken windows in at least three businesses, Schierbaum said.
“We will find you, and we will arrest you, and you will be held accountable.”After demonstrations appeared to have largely scattered, dozens of Georgia State Patrol officers responded into the city to support Atlanta police.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Six people were arrested after a peaceful protest over a proposed police training ground turned violent in Atlanta, Georgia, Saturday night, police said.
Police suppressed the violence quickly and no law enforcement officers or citizens were injured, Schierbaum said.
Authorities have stated that crimes have taken place at the protest site following the arrests last month.
"Law enforcement continues to address the criminal acts committed by the individuals that continue to occupy the area of the proposed training site."
Protesters have claimed the police training center will only serve to further militarize law enforcement and that the conflict between the protesters and authorities have been escalating in recent months.

     6 arrested after Atlanta protests over controversial ‘Cop City’ and fatal police shooting of activist
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Six people were arrested Saturday evening in downtown Atlanta, authorities said, during protests that came in response to a proposed police training facility and the fatal police shooting of an activist earlier in the week.
Police arrested six people and were continuing to investigate whether there were any others involved in illegal activity, the chief said.
The protests come in response to a planned $90 million, 85-acre law enforcement training facility – dubbed “Cop City” by its opponents – and just days after the police killing of a 26-year-old activist near the site of the training center.
A controversial facilityThe Atlanta Police Foundation has said the planned training center is needed to help boost morale and recruitment efforts, and previous facilities used by law enforcement are substandard.
But the facility, which will include a shooting range, mock city and burn building, has been met with fierce resistance.
