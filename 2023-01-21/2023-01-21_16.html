     Tony Dungy apologizes for controversial cat litter tweet that sparked outrage and backlash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Seriously, Tony Dungy?
"Some school districts are putting litter boxes in the school bathrooms for students who identify as cats.
By 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Dungy deleted his cat litter tweet which was in response to a Daily Wire video showing Minnesota State Rep. Sandra Feist advocating for menstrual items in boys' school bathrooms.
Dungy's response created some outrage as the cat litter story was debunked months ago after being spread by political conservatives who oppose LGBTQ+ rights and gender nonconformity.
Dungy, who currently serves as a television analyst, is known for his Christian faith and often conservative views, especially on social values.
