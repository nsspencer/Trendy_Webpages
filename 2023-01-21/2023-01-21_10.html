     Summary: The streak extends back to 1990, when the Blue Devils fell to UNLV in the national championship game.
Cameron Indoor is loud, and the Blue Devils are certainly feeding off of the crowd for this matchup against the No.
Through the first half, there were 11 lead changes and neither team’s lead exceeded five points.
His 14 points lead the game and his 4-of-7 shooting from deep is giving the Blue Devils fits on defense.

     Summary: Walter Payton was an epic talent.
A running back for the Chicago Bears from 1975-87, Payton smashed records relentlessly.
Payton was very lucky to be a Bear when Mike Ditka, Buddy Ryan and Jim McMahon, among others, were also affiliated with the team.
But when Chicago had the ball, Payton ran like a dream.
In a bit of meaningless fun, the Bears put out a video called the Super Bowl Shuffle.

     Duke Wins A Cameron Thriller Over Miami, 68-66
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A young Duke team had some stumbles along the way against Miami to be sure, but ultimately did what it could not do against Clemson and closed the Hurricanes out, 68-66.
Norchad Omier, who has been a huge asset for Miami since transferring in, is a really neat player.
Duke held Miami to 34.9 percent overall although the Hurricanes did hit 10-21 on threes, led by Miller, who was 3-4 and Pack, who was 4-9.
Pack kept them in the game in the first half but in the second, Duke put serious pressure on the ‘Canes.
If you're counting, that’s four points Duke gave up in the last :09, which, again, could have been fatal - but wasn’t.
