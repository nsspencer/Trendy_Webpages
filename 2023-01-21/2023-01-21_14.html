     Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes overcomes ankle injury, returns in Divisional Round win over Jaguars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes returned to Saturday's 27-20 Divisional Round win against the Jaguars despite suffering a right ankle injury in the first quarter that caused him to miss the majority of the second frame.
"He's a tough kid," Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said about Mahomes after the game.
The injury occurred when Mahomes got his ankle caught and rolled up under Jaguars linebacker Arden Key at the tail end of a short, four-yard pass.
Longtime Chiefs backup Chad Henne relieved Mahomes for one drive that leaned on the run game and ultimately went 98 yards for a score.
The Chiefs have now reached their fifth straight AFC Championship Game with Mahomes as a starter after he gutted his way through injury for a 5-0 career record in the Divisional Round.
