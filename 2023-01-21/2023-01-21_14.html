     Rob Gronkowski gives his opinion on what Tom Brady will do next
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers head into yet another offseason with a massive question hanging over them: Will Tom Brady be back for another year?
Brady is set to be a free agent again this offseason, after spending the past three seasons with the Bucs.
He can go play elsewhere, retire again, or come back for a fourth season in Tampa Bay.
After last week’s season-ending playoff loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Brady made it clear he would take some time before making a decision.
That hasn’t stopped rampant speculation from every direction this week, and the latest to throw his opinion in the ring is none other than one of his favorite teammates, Rob Gronkowski:That’s an answer that still seems to leave the door open for a return to Tampa Bay for Brady.
