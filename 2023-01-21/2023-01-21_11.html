Juventus deducted 15 pointsDrop down to tenth in Serie AMultiple ex-board members face bansWHAT HAPPENED?
Juventus are yet again engulfed in scandal having been deducted 15 points in Serie A for 'financial irregularities' and 'false accounting' in relation to past transfer dealings.
Former chairman and European Super League advocate, Andrea Agnelli, who stepped down last November, has been banned from holding office in Italian football for 24 months, while Pavel Nedved has been banned for eight months.
Italian prosecutors took umbrage with several of Juventus' dealings, including the now-infamous swap deal with Barcelona involving midfieldersArthur and Miralem Pjanic.

     Juventus deducted 15 points for current Serie A season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Juventus have been deducted 15 points for the current Serie A season after a case around alleged inflated transfer fees was reopened by an Italian court.
The Italian side have said they will appeal the decision after they dropped down to 10th in the Serie A table.
AdvertisementThe ruling applies to within Italian football but the country’s football federation (FIGC) has asked for it to be extended to UEFA and FIFA.
An initial appeal lodged by the Italian Football Federation’s federal prosecutor Giuseppe Chine to have it reopened was subsequently turned down.
Juventus were third in the table with 37 points from 18 games before the points deduction was made official on Friday evening.

     Juventus Deducted 15 Points As Former Club Officials Receive Bans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Maurizio Arrivabene, Andrea Agnelli, Federico Cherubini Juventus Football Director and Pavel Nedved ... [+] were all handed bans from football.
Getty ImagesNo sooner had Juventus appointed their new board this week, than the Bianconeri were back in the news after the Italian FA deducted them 15 points and handed out bans to a number of former club officials.
It stemmed from an appeal by Juventus against an investigation into inflated player transfer fees reported previously in this column.
Ultimately, that all led to Friday’s news that the club would be handed a 15-point deduction, as well as bans for the key figures involved.
Former President Andrea Agnelli and ex-CEO Maurizio Arrivabene were each handed two-year bans, while Sporting Director Federicio Cherubini was given 16-months.
