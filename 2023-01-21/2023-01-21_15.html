     Kylie Jenner Posts First Photos of Son's Face, Reveals Name
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kylie Jenner is finally showing off her baby boy almost a year after he was born -- posting the first photos where his face is in clear view ... while also declaring his new name.
The new mom did a photo dump Saturday, which contained 4 pictures of her son ... whom she delivered in February 2022.
FWIW, this name is of Hebrew origin, and it means "Lion of God," according to a ton of baby name sites.
You'll recall ... Kylie and her BD, Travis Scott, announced in March that they were scrapping their son's original name, Wolf, because they apparently felt it didn't quite fit him.
It wasn't done in a snap either -- there was a whole legal process the parents had to undertake.
