    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch : Kylie Jenner &amp; Travis Scott Reveal Baby Boy's NEW NAMEKylie Jenner just revealed that her baby boy with Travis Scott has a brand-new identity.
After initially naming their newborn Wolf Webster, the makeup mogul and the rapper decided to select a new moniker for their son.
Kylie not only announced the name in a Jan. 21 Instagram post, but also shared highly-anticipated photos of her little one.
The post drew love from family and friends, including Kris Jenner who wrote, "I love you Aire Webster."
As for the reason behind the change, Kylie explained in a March 21 Instagram post that the name Wolf didn't seem like the right fit for their little one.

     Kylie Jenner Finally Shared Her Baby Son's Name Along With Some Cute Photos Of The "Young King"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kylie Jenner has finally shared her son’s name and face with the world for the first time.
The couple had been fairly quiet about sharing personal information about their newborn, only posting occasional photos without his face.
Shortly after his birth, Kylie announced that they had decided on the name Wolf, but later said they had changed their mind about the name.
Since then, fans have speculated about what the young member of the Kardashian/Jenners could be named.
But those rumors have now been laid to rest, as Kylie finally shared her second child's name along with a carousel of photos showcasing his face.

     Kylie Jenner Posts First Photos of Son's Face, Reveals Name
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kylie Jenner is finally showing off her baby boy almost a year after he was born -- posting the first photos where his face is in clear view ... while also declaring his new name.
The new mom did a photo dump Saturday, which contained 4 pictures of her son ... whom she delivered in February 2022.
FWIW, this name is of Hebrew origin, and it means "Lion of God," according to a ton of baby name sites.
You'll recall ... Kylie and her BD, Travis Scott, announced in March that they were scrapping their son's original name, Wolf, because they apparently felt it didn't quite fit him.
It wasn't done in a snap either -- there was a whole legal process the parents had to undertake.
