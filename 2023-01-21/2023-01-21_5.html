     Summary: Teenage striker Evan Ferguson came to the rescue for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion by netting a late equaliser to give his side a 2-2 draw against Leicester City in a pulsating Premier League clash on Saturday.
"We always have a chance to win in the way we play ... we always have belief, so there was not a moment where we think the game is lost and we always have the fighting chance," Ferguson told the BBC.
The result leaves Brighton in sixth spot in the table on 31 points, two behind fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur and seven behind Newcastle United in fourth.
Leicester are 14th on 18 points.
"We put a marker down for the rest of the season in terms of what we have to do, in terms of our fight and mentality," Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers told the BBC.
