     Summary: British actor Julian Sands, who is known for his roles in popular film and television shows such as A Room With A View, 24 and Smallville, went missing last Friday while hiking in the Baldy Bowl area of the San Gabriel Mountains, north of Los Angeles.
The authorities have resumed an air search for him, but the ground search remains on pause due to poor road conditions, including icy conditions and the threat of avalanches.
According to reports, Mr Sands was last seen a week ago, and his car was found near where he was reported missing.
The authorities have previously said that they plan to continue looking for Mr Sands, and there is “no hard deadline” for ending their search mission.
His family and fellow actors have expressed concern for his well-being and are assisting the authorities in their search.
