     Cavs' Dean Wade (shoulder) plans to play vs. Bucks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After missing seven weeks with a shoulder injury, Cleveland Cavaliers forward Dean Wade is planning his return against the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday, sources told ESPN.
Wade, who suffered an AC joint sprain in his left shoulder on Dec. 2, had emerged as an important rotation player for the Cavaliers this season.
Wade, 26, started nine of his 17 games, averaging a career-high 24.1 minutes.
Wade signed a three-year, $18.5 million contract extension in the summer.
He's considered one of the franchise's notable development stories, as an undrafted player out of Kansas State in 2019 who grew into dependable two-way player for the Cavaliers.

     Cleveland Cavaliers forward Dean Wade to play Saturday after missing seven weeks
    </h2>

     Summary: As first reported by ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski (and confirmed by Fear the Sword), Dean Wade plans to play tonight after missing seven weeks with a sprain his left shoulder.
Wade suffered the injury on Dec. 2. and had his return delayed due to an ankle injury he suffered in practice.
In 17 games this season, Wade is averaging 6.4 points and 4.1 rebounds while shooting 41.1% from the field and 45.2% from the field.

     Dean Wade Planning To Make Return To Cavs Against Bucks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wade has not played since December 12 when Cleveland got a victory over the Orlando Magic.
After that game, the forward learned that he had a shoulder injury that would keep him out for an extended period of time.
After missing over a month of basketball, Dean Wade is reportedly planning on making his return to the floor against the Milwaukee Buckson Saturday night.
He was shooting them at a 41.1 percent rate before going down with the shoulder injury.
Coming in a six foot nine inches, Wade checks off that box when Cleveland wants to run a big lineup.

     Milwaukee Bucks vs. Cleveland Cavaliers Preview: En Garde
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After what’s seemed like the most prolonged break of Milwaukee Bucks basketball in months, the team is back in action Saturday night for a contest against Central Division foes the Cleveland Cavaliers.
The Bucks have submitted their injury report for Saturday’s game in Cleveland.
They’ll need him on both ends for this one to slow down the Cavaliers guards and penetrate their stingy defense.
They’ve maintained spitting distance of the one seed in the Eastern Conference too, only 6.5 games behind as of publication.
Against Toronto, Milwaukee needed all 25 of his points to pull out the win and they’ll need his contributions again this weekend.
