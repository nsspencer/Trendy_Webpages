     Saquon Barkley contract breakdown: Pros &amp; cons of Giants' difficult decision for 2023 offseason
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There was one wild card: Saquon Barkley.
Why the Giants shouldn't re-sign Saquon BarkleyMany running backs don't even get the chance to sign a significant second contract.
Only three running backs (Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Ezekiel Elliott) are making north of $13 million per year.
If Barkley wants a contract that puts him among the league's highest-paid running backs, however, history says it might not be worthwhile for the Giants.

     Saquon Barkley addresses his future with Giants following playoff loss to Eagles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moments after his team's season-ending 38-7 loss to the Eagles on Saturday night, Saquon Barkley was asked about his future with the Giants heading into the offseason.
"I can't envision that being my last time in a Giants uniform," Barkley said following his team's divisional round playoff loss, via NFL Media.
This season, Barkley ran for a career-high 1,312 yards.
Alvin Kamara, Ezekiel Elliott and Dalvin Cook round out the list of running backs who make $15 million annually.
The Giants currently have the third-most cap space in the NFL and the most in the ultra-competitive NFC East.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA — “I can’t envision that being my last time in a Giants uniform,” Saquon Barkley said late Saturday night after taking off his uniform for the last time this season.
“I’ve been vocal about how I feel and where I want to be,” Barkley said.
In the regular season, Barkley had career highs in rushing attempts (295) and rushing yards (1,312).
That’s well off his career highs of 91 catches for 721 yards and four touchdowns in his rookie season.
In that rookie season, he led the league in yards from scrimmage with 2,028.

     Summary: "I'll probably sit down with my agent at some time this week," Barkley, who is a pending free agent, told NFL Network Insider Mike Garafolo postgame.
"I've been vocal about how I feel, where I want to be and where I want to stay.
Barkley set career highs in the regular season with 295 carries and 1,312 rushing yards, and his 10 rushing TDs trailed behind only his prolific rookie campaign.
"It sucks," Barkley told reporters in the team locker room.
The runaway game shifts the focus from a Giants season that exceeded expectations to an offseason expected to shape the team's next several years.
