A running back for the Chicago Bears from 1975-87, Payton smashed records relentlessly.
Payton was very lucky to be a Bear when Mike Ditka, Buddy Ryan and Jim McMahon, among others, were also affiliated with the team.
But when Chicago had the ball, Payton ran like a dream.
In a bit of meaningless fun, the Bears put out a video called the Super Bowl Shuffle.
