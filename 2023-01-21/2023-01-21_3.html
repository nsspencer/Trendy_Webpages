     Summary: Once the second half started, the 49ers' defense hunkered down, allowing the Seahawks to score only six points, which came with the game in hand.
After studying film of the game, Ryans pointed out five key areas where the 49ers must improve against the Cowboys.
"Playoffs, Cowboys, Niners, our defense has to play their absolute best if we want to move forward."
Against the Cowboys, Ryans' work indeed is cut out for him.
49ers fans are hopeful Ryans' work with the players during the week leading up to the clash can produce positive results.

     Brett Maher remains Cowboys kicker vs. 49ers despite nightmare game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NFC Divisional Playoff between the 49ers and Dallas Cowboys on Sunday at Levi's Stadium should be a close game if last year's wild-card round matchup is any indicator.
As a result, it could come down to a field-goal attempt made, which doesn't bode well for Cowboys kicker Brett Maher, who might lack confidence.
Nonetheless, Maher will be the starting kicker despite missing an NFL-record four PATs in Dallas' 31-14 wild-card round win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
The Cowboys also elevated C Brock Hoffmann and CB Xavier Rhodes from the practice squad for tomorrowâs game at San Francisco.
— Dallas Cowboys Public Relations (@DallasCowboysPR) January 21, 2023The Cowboys signed former 49ers kicker Tristan Vizcaino to the practice squad Wednesday as insurance.
