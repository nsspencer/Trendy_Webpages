     Brett Maher remains Cowboys kicker vs. 49ers despite nightmare game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NFC Divisional Playoff between the 49ers and Dallas Cowboys on Sunday at Levi's Stadium should be a close game if last year's wild-card round matchup is any indicator.
As a result, it could come down to a field-goal attempt made, which doesn't bode well for Cowboys kicker Brett Maher, who might lack confidence.
Nonetheless, Maher will be the starting kicker despite missing an NFL-record four PATs in Dallas' 31-14 wild-card round win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
The Cowboys also elevated C Brock Hoffmann and CB Xavier Rhodes from the practice squad for tomorrowâs game at San Francisco.
— Dallas Cowboys Public Relations (@DallasCowboysPR) January 21, 2023The Cowboys signed former 49ers kicker Tristan Vizcaino to the practice squad Wednesday as insurance.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite playing behind a shaky offensive line, Prescott continues to navigate pressure and avoid sacks at the league’s fifth-best rate.
On third downs, when the defense generally knows he’s going to pass and the entire drive is on the line, Prescott targeted receivers nearly 4 yards beyond the sticks on average.
Seven of Prescott’s interceptions this year have come on must-pass third downs.
And while Prescott’s interceptions have been costly, that impact is dwarfed by that of the other 97% of his plays.
Across all situations, Prescott ranks No.

(Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott) Zeke is still playing well, a physical runner, so we have to do a really good job of stopping the run.

     Football World Reacts To Cowboys Kicker Decision
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)Prior to last week's wild card win over the Bucs, Cowboys kicker Brett Maher had been about as steady as they come.
But after signing another kicker this week, Dallas reportedly decided to stick with its guy ahead of tomorrow's game.
Per the NFL Network's Ian Rapoport: "The Cowboys did not activate kicker Tristan Vizcaino from the practice squad, meaning they are rolling with Brett Maher vs. the 49ers."
"We are laughing," a 49ers fan commented.
Maher missed a historic four extra-point attempts in the Cowboys wild card win.
