     After a Late Red Flag, a Thrilling Sprint to the Indy 500 Finish
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What seemed like an easy, sure victory turned into one of the most dramatic finishes in recent memory, as Marcus Ericsson held on after a late restart to win the 106th running of the Indianapolis 500.
With five laps to go, Ericsson, a 31-year-old Swedish driver, held a nearly three-second lead on Pato O’Ward, the 23-year-old Mexican driver for Arrow McLaren SP.
But a late crash by Jimmie Johnson, the seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion who was racing in his first Indianapolis 500, brought out a red flag that stopped the race with four laps left.
In a two-lap shootout after the restart, Ericsson wove left and right to disrupt the slipstream and fight off an intense charge from O’Ward to take the checkered flag.
“I knew the car was fast enough, but it was still hard,” Ericsson told NBC after the race.

     Former F1 Driver Marcus Ericsson Wins Indy 500
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Marcus Ericsson had to leave Formula One to become a global superstar — a goal achieved Sunday when the Swedish driver won the Indianapolis 500.
A crash back in traffic brought out the caution and Ericsson coasted to the victory podium under yellow.
It is the fifth Indy 500 victory for team owner Chip Ganassi, who caught a ride to the victory podium on the side of Ericsson’s car.
Ericsson is the second Swede to win the Indy 500 in 106 runnings, joining 1999 winner Kenny Brack.
Ganassi had not won the 500 in 10 years and sent five legitimate contenders to Indy to end the drought.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marcus Ericsson held off Pato O’Ward in that shootout, with Tony Kanaan finishing third.
Ericsson became the second Swedish driver to win the Indy 500, following Kenny Brack (1999).
O’Ward, a 23-year-old Mexican widely viewed as having a bright future in the sport, was looking for his second win of the year and his fourth since 2021.
He previously won the Indy 500 from the pole in 2008.
That remains the one victory in the event for Dixon, a 41-year-old citizen of New Zealand who lives in Indianapolis.
