    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Novak Djokovic defeats Diego Schwartzman to move on to the quarterfinal round of the French Open.
(0:20)Defending champion Novak Djokovic has reached his record 16th career Roland Garros quarterfinal and could find a familiar foe across the net next: Rafael Nadal.
He fell behind 3-0 in the second set but grabbed seven games in a row to take that set and a 1-0 lead in the third.
And if 13-time French Open champion Nadal wins his fourth-round match against Felix Auger-Aliassime later Sunday, the two longtime rivals would meet each other in the quarterfinals.
That would be the 59th head-to-head matchup between Djokovic and Nadal, more than any other two men in the professional era of tennis.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Julien PretotPARIS (Reuters) – Novak Djokovic showed glimpses of his brilliant best to demolish Diego Schwartzman 6-1 6-3 6-3 on Sunday and book his place in the French Open quarter-finals where he is likely to face 13-times champion Rafael Nadal.
The world number one’s pace was too much for Argentine Schwartzman, who barely threatened despite enjoying a 3-0 lead in the second set.
From then on it was a one-way street for Serbian Djokovic, who won 12 of the remaining 15 games on a chilly Court Suzanne Lenglen.
He raced through it, barely troubled by his opponent’s drop shots and almost managing to get the extra shot.
Schwartzman showed signs of frustration when Djokovic left him red-faced with a delightful drop shot to go 3-2 up in the third.

     Summary: World number one and defending champion Novak Djokovic reached a 16th French Open quarter-final on Sunday where old rival and 13-time winner Rafael Nadal could be waiting.
Djokovic, bidding to equal Nadal's record of 21 Grand Slam titles, eased to a 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 last-16 victory against 15th seed Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.
He's a good person off the court," said Djokovic who has now beaten Schwartzman seven times in seven meetings.
Djokovic is still to drop a set at Roland Garros after cruising through the first week.
Toni coached his nephew for the best part of three decades during which time Nadal won 16 of his record 21 Slam titles.
