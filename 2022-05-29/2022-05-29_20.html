    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A day after Liverpool lost in the UEFA Champions League final to Real Madrid, the club was dealt another blow.
Versatile forward Sadio Mane reportedly confirmed his decision to leave the club after six seasons, according to football journalist Fabrizio Romano:Sadio ManÃ© has decided to leave Liverpool this summer ðŸš¨ðŸ”´ #LFCHeâ€™s ready for a new experience after many special years with Reds - it will be confirmed to the club.
FC Bayern are strong contenders - but itâ€™s still open and not completed as Sadio wanted to wait for the final.

In 269 appearances with the club, Mane logged 120 goals and 38 assists and hoisted six different titles: Premier League, Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, FA Cup and Carabao Cup.

     Sadio Mane Expected to Leave Liverpool, per Reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool star Sadio ManÃ© is set to leave the club this summer, according to multiple reports.

     Sadio Mane transfer: Liverpool star wants to move and Bayern Munich make perfect sense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Romano reports that Bayern Munich are the strongest contenders to sign him.
But what makes Mane, 30, so intriguing for Julian Nagelsmann at Bayern Munich?
Bayern Munich used five different formations this season with the majority of their matches being played from a base 4-2-3-1.
But adding Mane could potentially push Gnabry out the door, depending on the direction the club wants to go in for the attack.
Adding Mane would be a positive start for a team with the talent to return to European supremacy.
