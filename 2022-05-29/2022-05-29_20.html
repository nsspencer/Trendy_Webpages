     'Stranger Things' Season 4 Will Have Two More Episodes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fans who've just finished the new episodes of Stranger Things, don't worry—episode 7 isn't the finale.
That's because episodes 1-7 were just the first part of this supersized season, which per the Duffer Brothers has a runtime "nearly twice the length of any previous season."
Courtesy of NetflixThe two final episodes will be feature-length.
If we consider the average length of Stranger Things episodes, Volume 2 really gives us three episodes worth of content to finish off the supersized season.
After those, we have the fifth and final season to answer all remaining questions.

The biggest question looming over Stranger Things Season 4 is whether or not Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) can regain her powers.
Brown joked in an interview with The Wrap that the cast of Stranger Things had grown too big, and they needed a Game of Thrones-esque cull to get rid of some of the characters.
