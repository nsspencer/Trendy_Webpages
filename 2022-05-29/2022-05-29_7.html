In the 43rd minute, Nottingham Forest midfielder James Garner fired a dangerous ball into the box, and it was deflected in for the game's only goal by Huddersfield defender Levi Colwill.
The win marks a huge moment for one of the initial founding members of the Premier League.

     How Nottingham Forest won promotion to the Premier League after beating Huddersfield in Championship play-off final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nottingham Forest ended their 23-year absence from the Premier League after sealing promotion from the Championship with a 1-0 win over Huddersfield Town in the play-off final at Wembley.
The game’s only goal came just before half-time, when Levi Colwill turned a James Garner cross into the roof of his own net, sparking wild scenes amongst the Forest supporters.
It was a tense clash between two sides who have had phenomenal seasons, with clear-cut chances few and far between throughout.
Ten minutes later, Huddersfield had another claim for a spot-kick waved away as Max Lowe made a clumsy challenge on Lewis O’Brien.
As the game headed towards its conclusion, O’Brien fired wide in injury time as Forest sat deep and held on to seal promotion back to the Premier League for the first time since 1999.

     Summary: When Cooper took over in September Forest were bottom of the Championship but after an extraordinary run they are back in the big time.
By the end Forest fans, many with hands on heads taking it all in, swayed through six minutes of second-half stoppage time, nerves frayed.
Huddersfield struggled to work the Forest goalkeeper, Brice Samba, the penalty shootout hero in the semi-finals, but Sorba Thomas, one of those distraught at full-time, kept Worrall guessing.
In the second half another Thomas cross proved problematic, this time from the right, but Djed Spence shepherded the ball out.
For Forest, who replaced Samba with Ethan Horvath with a minute to spare, emotions ran wild.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nottingham Forest needed some help, but with a 1-0 victory over Huddersfield Town in the EFL Championship promotion playoffs final, the Tricky Trees will return to the Premier League, ending a 23-year absence.
From then, they picked up 23 wins to go on a run of a lifetime to the Premier League.
The second question is on Ryan Yates making the transition to the Premier League.
Their promotion campaign has been his best scoring eight goals in the Championship, but the jump to the Premier League is a big one.
Yates has earned being the starter on day one in the Premier League but Cooper would do well to bring in a midfielder or two with Premier League experience to compete and push.

     Summary: From shinney players to shin guards and the European Cup to the playoffs, Forest's history is a story full of compelling characters and unlikely plotlines.
Forest won the FA Cup again in 1959, beating Luton Town in the final, before a 16-year wait for the most extraordinary turn of events in the club's history.
With promotion back to the top flight duly secured, Forest won the First Division in 1978, the League Cup in 1978 and 1979 and the European Cup in 1979 and 1980.
23 - Nottingham Forest will begin next season as a Premier League side for the first time since 1998-99.
Between 1993 and 1996, Forest were known as Premier League entertainers, and their subsequent demise was mourned by many neutrals.
