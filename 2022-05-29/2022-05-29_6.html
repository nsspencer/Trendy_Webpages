     2022 French Open: Rafael Nadal outlasts Felix Auger-Aliassime, setting up Novak Djokovic matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rafael Nadal advanced to the French Open quarterfinals for the 16th time with a marathon win over Felix Auger-Aliassime in the fourth round on Sunday.
Auger-Aliassime, 21, got out to the early lead but Nadal roared back to win the next two sets.
But the Canadian claimed the fourth set, forcing the King of Clay to a fifth set for just the third time in his French Open career.
With a win, Nadal would have a shot to grow his men's Grand Slam titles record to 22, while a loss would clear the path for Djokovic to tie him at 21.
Djokovic defeated Diego Schwartzman in the fourth round earlier Sunday.

More infoRafael Nadal reminded Novak Djokovic that they were playing at his most successful tournament after setting up a rematch with his long-time rival in the French Open quarter-final.
The mind games have already started ahead of the 59th meeting between Nadal and Djokovic.
The fifth seed appeared to downplay his chances after having worse preparations ahead of the French Open having returned from injury in Madrid where he lost to Carlos Alcaraz before crashing out of the Italian Open in the third round.
But he did manage to send Djokovic a reminder that they were in his territory at the French Open ahead of their quarter-final meeting.
