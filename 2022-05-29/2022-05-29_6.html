    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rafael Nadal took his time but eventually kept his side of the bargain to set up the quarter-final showdown that will probably define this year’s French Open.
Nadal will face arch-rival Novak Djokovic after overcoming the determined Felix Auger-Aliassime across five enthralling sets over four hours and 21 minutes.
He has given us so much.”Djokovic’s name was even booed when uttered during Nadal’s on-court interview, but he had already given the perfect response with a 6-1 6-3 6-3 demolition of the 15th seed.
But when Auger-Aliassime took Nadal into a fifth set – for only the third time at Roland Garros – it was all too much for Nadal senior to bear and he left.
Third seed Alexander Zverev won his fourth-round match against Spanish qualifier Bernabe Zapata Miralles 7-6 (11) 7-5 6-3.

But as far as pure sporting entertainment goes, it will be hard to top, inside or outside of tennis, in 2022.
This five-set match played out in five acts, as the two traded the momentum back and forth every 10 games or soThe first act was dominated by Auger-Aliassime.
He broke Nadal in the third game of the match and used his serve—especially the wide one in the deuce court—his forehand, his drop shot, and his net game to win the first set.
FAA played above-the-net tennis, while Nadal was mired behind the baseline.

     Summary: Rafael Nadal advanced to the French Open quarterfinals for the 16th time with a marathon win over Felix Auger-Aliassime in the fourth round on Sunday.
Auger-Aliassime, 21, got out to the early lead but Nadal roared back to win the next two sets.
But the Canadian claimed the fourth set, forcing the King of Clay to a fifth set for just the third time in his French Open career.
With a win, Nadal would have a shot to grow his men's Grand Slam titles record to 22, while a loss would clear the path for Djokovic to tie him at 21.
