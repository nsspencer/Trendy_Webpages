     US, Canada investigating strawberries linked to hepatitis A outbreak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Several health agencies in the United States and Canada are investigating a hepatitis A outbreak potentially connected to organic strawberries purchased in March and April.
The FDA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, along with state and local partners, are investigating the infections, according to an announcement.
Hepatitis A cases reported in California, Minnesota and Canada were traced back to people who purchased the organic strawberry brands, the FDA said.
The strawberry-related outbreak comes amid a global pediatric hepatitis outbreak.
The CDC has issued new guidance about testing for adenovirus in children as a possible reason for pediatric outbreak, but it remains unclear if the two are linked.
