     Tennis-Nadal edges Auger-Aliassime thriller to book Djokovic date
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nadal will hope he can recover in time from the gruelling contest for his next outing, where the reigning champion awaits for their 59th career showdown.
The Spaniard, who will turn 36 on Friday, has lifted the Musketeers’ Cup a record 13 times but was ousted in the semi-finals last year by Djokovic.
The clash on Court Philippe Chatrier was the second meeting between Nadal and Auger-Aliassime but the first since Toni Nadal began working with the Canadian in 2021.
After an early trade of service breaks, Auger-Aliassime broke Nadal’s delivery a second time to take the contest to a deciding fifth set.
The last time Nadal played a five-setter at Roland Garros was in the 2013 semi-final, when he beat Djokovic.

     Nadal Survives Felix In Five, Sets Djokovic Blockbuster At Roland Garros
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rafael Nadal won a Roland Garros thriller Sunday when he survived a major scare from Felix Auger-Aliassime to set a blockbuster quarter-final showdown with World No.
One of the best players in the world,” Nadal said when asked about Auger-Aliassime in his on-court interview.
“We know each other well,” Nadal said when looking ahead to his match against Djokovic.
He continued to swing freely at the start of the second set, pulling the Spaniard around the baseline with his precision.
However, after saving two break points on serve at 1-1 in the second set, Nadal started to grow into the match.
