     New York Rangers: A tale of two Chytils
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If there has been one surprise in the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs for the New York Rangers, it has been the transformation of Filip Chytil.
Chytil, along with Igor Shesterkin, was the star of Game Six with two goals including the game winner.
It was his best game of the postseason, very likely the best game of his career.
As a 20-year-old in 2019-20 he scored 14 goals and seemed poised to explode as the future second line center for the Rangers.
With the Rangers facing a severe salary cap situation and Ryan Strome a pending unrestricted free agent, Chytil’s play could solve a lot of issues for the Blueshirts going forward.
