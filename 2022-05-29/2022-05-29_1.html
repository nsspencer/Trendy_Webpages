     Is It Ever OK to Say 'Happy Memorial Day'? Americans Split Over Sentiment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today (May 30, 2022), is Memorial Day, a day to honor all those who gave their lives in service to their country.
While it may seem natural to wish someone a "Happy Memorial Day," Americans remain split over whether it is an appropriate phrase to use to mark the national day of remembrance.
Is It Ever Appropriate To Say 'Happy Memorial Day'?
COSF CEO and Co-Founder Kristina Kaufmann told Newsweek that for some, the meaning of Memorial Day is deeply personal and not a day of celebration, and therefore it isn't appropriate to wish someone a "Happy Memorial Day."
She added, "One of the most hurtful things to hear or see when you've lost a parent is 'Happy Memorial Day.'

     Memorial Day: Remembering and cherishing members of America’s military
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Memorial Day, families across Michigan will celebrate the long weekend while remembering the men and women who died while serving in the U.S. military.
As of 2020, WWII veterans in the U.S., totalled around 500,000 but the Census Bureau estimates that by 2030, only 8,000 WWII veterans will remain.
Using the data from the report researchers at Porch found that California (53,807) and Florida (48,220) have the most WWII veterans.
In addition to the Memorial Day parades, U.S. and Michigan flags within the State Capitol Complex and upon all public buildings and grounds across the state will be lowered to half-staff in recognition of Memorial Day.
“On Memorial Day, we remember the brave Americans who served our nation in uniform and made the ultimate sacrifice,” Gov.

There are so many events and businesses and organizations that are gone from three years ago and aren’t coming back.”The last live parade on Constitution Avenue was held in 2019.
But with the recent easing of the pandemic and many of its restrictions, organizers decided to hold the parade live again this year.
In 1949, the Air Force held the first gunnery competition at what was then Las Vegas Air Force Base, now Nellis Air Force Base.
Harvey was then stationed at Lockbourne Air Force Base, near Columbus, Ohio.

     Summary: I weep when I see his face — because I know it is my face.
I know it is the face of every recruit who I battled through hell and emerged triumphant with on boot camp graduation day.
To me, that’s what Memorial Day represents — saluting those who fight the battle on the side that yearns for a freer, more peaceful world once the shooting stops.
Their glory — and the reason there is a Memorial Day — is they were willing to serve or to put themselves in harm’s way.
That’s what Memorial Day is about — to honor those who died and who served to keep freedom alive at home and throughout the globe.
