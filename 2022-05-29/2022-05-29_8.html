     The Latest On MJF Potentially No Showing AEW ‘Double Or Nothing’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The situation surrounding MJF not showing up at AEW Fan Fest yesterday continues to evolve.
As noted earlier, despite being scheduled for meet &amp; greets at AEW Fan Fest yesterday, MJF didn’t show up to the event and couldn’t be contacted by AEW management.
But according to the latest update from PWInsider, MJF currently remains in Las Vegas and didn’t fly back to “the East Coast” overnight.
MJF is scheduled to face Wardlow at tonight’s AEW “Double or Nothing” Pay-Per-View with the stipulation being that if MJF wins, Wardlow can never sign with AEW.
If Wardlow wins, he is free from his contract with MJF and can sign with the company.

     AEW's MJF Dilemma, Current MVPs of WWE, Britt Baker's Booking, More Quick Takes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful was the first to report MJF missing his meet-and-greet in Las Vegas and nearly flying home later that night.
What that means for their matchup remains to be seen, but the rest of the lineup has plenty of potential on paper.
That includes the final of the women's Owen Hart tournament between Britt Baker and Ruby Soho, though yet another pay-per-view win for Baker may backfire if she booked to take home the trophy.
Meanwhile, WWE continues to struggle to create stars of their own in the absence of so many inactive notable names.
This installment of Quick Takes will tackle Owens and Zayn excelling in their current roles, the latest on MJF's status, why Gunther must win the Intercontinental Championship and more.

     AEW: Latest Update on MJF Heading Into Double or Nothing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✖MJF's status for AEW's Double or Nothing pay-per-view was suddenly called into question on Saturday night.
AEW remained quiet about the situation, but on Sunday its YouTube channel still uploaded a video previewing Friedman's match with Wardlow.
The stipulation for Sunday's match states if Wardlow wins, he is free from his contract with MJF and will presumably be signed to a deal with AEW right away (in kayfabe).
But if Max wins, Wardlow is never allowed to sign with AEW.
Check out the full card for Double or Nothing below and stay tuned for any more updates on the situation.

     Rumor Roundup special edition: MJF/AEW Double or Nothing weekend drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a relatively calm Double or Nothing/Memorial Day weekend... until the reports of Maxwell Jacob Friedman no-showing a scheduled appearance at AEW’s FanFest hit on Saturday night (May 28).
Everything in wrestling can be turned into one eventually of course, as we may see this transform into one very soon.
Insider heard from fans at FanFest they saw Friedman playing slots at Mandalay Bay (where FanFest was held) while he was supposed to be doing his scheduled meet-and-greets.
An AEW official told Fightful the company was “very unhappy with the way things played out.”As has previously been reported, the issue is reportedly money.
Either way, sources told Fightful and Insider that MJF was not on the plane when the flight took off for New Jersey early this morning.

     MJF No Shows AEW Event Before Double Or Nothing 2022; Samoa Joe Double-Booked
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wardlow vs. MJF is in jeopardy at AEW Double or Nothing.
Just 24 hours before MJF vs. Wardlow at AEW Double or Nothing, MJF reportedly no-showed an AEW Meet and Greet.
MJF straight-up ghosted AEW, as his absence was not planned and nobody from the company was able to contact him.
MJF’s status for AEW Double or Nothing remains uncertain.
The latest drama surrounding MJF is yet another chapter in an increasingly ugly contract situation between MJF and AEW President Tony Khan.
