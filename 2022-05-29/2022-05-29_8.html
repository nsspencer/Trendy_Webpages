     It’s Djokovic vs. Nadal, the French Open Rematch We’ve Been Waiting For
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS — As the kids like to say these days, it’s on.
Far sooner than many may have hoped, Novak Djokovic, the reigning French Open champion, will take on Rafael Nadal, a 13-time champion at Roland Garros, in a quarterfinal match on Tuesday, the first rematch of two of the leading men’s players since their epic semifinal last June.
It took some of Nadal’s greatest tennis to survive a five-set, four-hour, 21-minute thriller Sunday evening against Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada, but the match that so many crave is on the horizon.
“A huge challenge and probably the biggest one that you can have here in Roland Garros,” Djokovic said, anticipating Nadal, after his fourth straight-sets win, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3, a pummeling of Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.
“I’m ready for it.”Perhaps more than Nadal, who survived one of the great scares of his storied French Open career against Auger-Aliassime, the athletic and tireless Canadian with a booming serve and big forehand.

“I am in quarter-finals of Roland Garros.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rafael Nadal won a Roland Garros thriller Sunday when he survived a major scare from Felix Auger-Aliassime to set a blockbuster quarter-final showdown with World No.
One of the best players in the world,” Nadal said when asked about Auger-Aliassime in his on-court interview.
“We know each other well,” Nadal said when looking ahead to his match against Djokovic.
He continued to swing freely at the start of the second set, pulling the Spaniard around the baseline with his precision.
However, after saving two break points on serve at 1-1 in the second set, Nadal started to grow into the match.

     Rafael Nadal wins a thriller at the French Open. Up next: Novak Djokovic.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadPARIS — It took every shot in Rafael Nadal’s repertoire, total conviction and considerable “suffering,” as the Spaniard put it, to reach the French Open quarterfinals.
At this stage in his hard-slugging career, the injuries and ailments are baggage he carries that he didn’t have in 2005, when he won his first French Open title just days after his 19th birthday.
Djokovic holds a 30-28 career edge on Nadal, but Nadal leads 19-8 on clay.
Djokovic won their most recent meeting on the tricky surface, ousting Nadal in the 2021 French Open semifinals en route to claiming the title for a second time.
But the ninth-seeded Auger-Aliassime, who was seeking his fourth consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal appearance, weathered the Spaniard’s best.

Rafael Nadal prevailed over Felix Auger-Aliassime in five sets on Sunday, setting up a quarterfinal matchup with Novak Djokovic.
The only time Toni Nadal moved in the first set was when Auger-Aliassime leapt for an incredible reverse volley, which he politely applauded.
"I didn't start the match well -- it was a tough first set," Rafael Nadal said.
Toni Nadal stayed while his nephew danced around the court like he was 20 again against his new protégé.

But as far as pure sporting entertainment goes, it will be hard to top, inside or outside of tennis, in 2022.
This five-set match played out in five acts, as the two traded the momentum back and forth every 10 games or soThe first act was dominated by Auger-Aliassime.
He broke Nadal in the third game of the match and used his serve—especially the wide one in the deuce court—his forehand, his drop shot, and his net game to win the first set.
FAA played above-the-net tennis, while Nadal was mired behind the baseline.

We played for a long time today and it's still the quarter-finals and afterwards there's still two more matches to win to win the tournament.
“So as I said, I really wish him the very best, but it will be a monumental effort for him, I think, to win.
Auger-Aliassime experienced the difficulty of playing Nadal himself on Sunday, when he played top-tier tennis only to fall short against the fifth seed.
