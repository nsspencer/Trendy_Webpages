     Summary: Gujarat captain Hardik Pandya conjured up a stellar all-round display as his team clinched the low-scoring final with 11 balls to spare.
Pandya (3-17) led by example with the ball, claiming the crucial wickets of counterpart Sanju Samson, opener Buttler and Rajasthan's middle-order lynchpin Shimron Hetmyer.
Gujarat lost Wriddhiman Saha and Matthew Wade cheaply but Pandya combined with Shubman Gill in a 63-run stand to help Gujarat overcome a slow start.
"Exceeded all my expectation for the season apart from today," Buttler said.

Pandya grabbed three for17 with impeccable medium-fast bowling to restrict Rajasthan to 130 for nine after Sanju Samson won the toss and chose to bat.
Pandya had Shimron Hetmyer (11) caught off his own bowling in the last ball of a terrific four-over spell.

     Hardik Pandya Scripts Special Record In Gujarat Titans IPL Title Triumph
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Mumbai-based outfit, Hardik Pandya captured the IPL title on four occasions, winning the cash-rich league in 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020.
Hardik Pandya, however, pipped CSK skipper MS Dhoni and former Mumbai Indians pacer Lasith Malinga, both of whom have won the IPL title four times each.
Under Rohit’s leadership, Mumbai Indians have won the IPL trophy five times in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020.
Hardik Pandya may have failed to break Rohit Sharma’s record for the most IPL titles, but he did equal MS Dhoni’s special record in the competition.
Hardik Pandya also became just the fourth Indian captain to win the IPL title after MS Dhoni, Rohit Sharma, and Gautam Gambhir.

In seven seasons for Mumbai in the IPL, Hardik had scored his runs at a strike rate of 153.91.
If you have watched Hardik bat over the years, you wouldn't be surprised by his success in his new role.
When he next plays T20Is for India, he'll probably get to play that sort of role, batting at No.

Jeetubhai remembers the first time he tried to introduce captaincy to Hardik, just after the second IPL season.
He knows how backing them to be themselves can be a very powerful thing,” the coach says.
During his captaincy stint, he has talked about how bowling coach Ashish Nehra and him are like two peas in a pod in cricketing matters.
