     Sadio Mane only allowed to go for over £25m if replacement lined up – Liverpool
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool are adamant Sadio Mane will only be allowed to leave for a fee in excess of £25million providing they have a suitable replacement lined up after the forward was heavily linked with Bayern Munich.
The Bundesliga champions, who themselves look likely to lose striker Robert Lewandowski this summer, have yet to even make contact with the Reds about any potential deal.
But having allowed his contract to tick down to the final 12 months, the likelihood of signing a new one looks less likely, despite him scoring 23 goals this season.
“Wherever Sadio will play next year, he will be a big player,” said the Reds boss.
Mane is not the only contract issues Liverpool have to resolve this summer as fellow forwards Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino – who make up the rest of his famed front three – are also entering their final 12 months.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sadio Mané has resolved to leave Liverpool this summer, with Bayern Munich among the clubs hoping to sign the 30-year-old forward.

Mané has one year left on his contract and whereas Mohamed Salah, who is in the same situation, has declared that he will stay, the Senegal international intends to tell Liverpool he wants a transfer.
Liverpool have been trying to persuade Mané to extend his deal and would be reluctant sellers, and the question is whether they receive an offer which convinces them to sanction his departure.

The Senegal international has been strongly linked with a move to Bayern Munich, who are on the hunt for a replacement for Robert Lewandowski.
AdMane, who played the full 90 minutes of Liverpool’s 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid in Saturday’s Champions League final, promised to make an announcement on his future shortly, and, according to reports, he wants to move away from Merseyside.

     Sadio Mane transfer: Liverpool star wants to move and Bayern Munich make perfect sense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Romano reports that Bayern Munich are the strongest contenders to sign him.
But what makes Mane, 30, so intriguing for Julian Nagelsmann at Bayern Munich?
Bayern Munich used five different formations this season with the majority of their matches being played from a base 4-2-3-1.
But adding Mane could potentially push Gnabry out the door, depending on the direction the club wants to go in for the attack.
Adding Mane would be a positive start for a team with the talent to return to European supremacy.
