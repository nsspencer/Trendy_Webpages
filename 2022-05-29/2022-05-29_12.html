     Former Sixers big man Al Horford makes Finals as Celtics beat Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Sixers All-Star Andre Iguodala is headed to the Finals once again as the Golden State Warriors knocked off the Dallas Mavericks and he will be joined there by another former Sixer, Al Horford.
Horford spent one tough season with the Sixers and he did not have a big impact there as Philadelphia struggled mightily to make it work with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons.
The spacing was terrible and Horford was traded in the 2021 offseason to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Danny Green.
Horford had five points and 13 rebounds as he was big on the defensive end.
Another former Sixer, Heat star Jimmy Butler had 35 points and nine rebounds to keep Miami in the game a bit.

I'm proud to share this with a veteran, a mentor, a brother, a guy like Al Horford.
Horford, who will turn 36 the day after playing in his first NBA Finals game, scored just five points in Game 7.
Brad Stevens saved Horford from NBA purgatory over the summer, bringing him back to Boston to be the glue to hold the team together.
And now, after 1,090 regular and postseason games, Horford is getting his first chance to become an NBA champion.
