     It’s Djokovic vs. Nadal, the French Open Rematch We’ve Been Waiting For
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS — As the kids like to say these days, it’s on.
Far sooner than many may have hoped, Novak Djokovic, the reigning French Open champion, will take on Rafael Nadal, a 13-time champion at Roland Garros, in a quarterfinal match on Tuesday, the first rematch of two of the leading men’s players since their epic semifinal last June.
It took some of Nadal’s greatest tennis to survive a five-set, four-hour, 21-minute thriller Sunday evening against Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada, but the match that so many crave is on the horizon.
“A huge challenge and probably the biggest one that you can have here in Roland Garros,” Djokovic said, anticipating Nadal, after his fourth straight-sets win, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3, a pummeling of Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.
“I’m ready for it.”Perhaps more than Nadal, who survived one of the great scares of his storied French Open career against Auger-Aliassime, the athletic and tireless Canadian with a booming serve and big forehand.

     Summary: Rafael Nadal’s 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 win over Felix Auger-Aliassime at Roland Garros on Sunday may or may not go down as the best match of the year.
But as far as pure sporting entertainment goes, it will be hard to top, inside or outside of tennis, in 2022.
This five-set match played out in five acts, as the two traded the momentum back and forth every 10 games or soThe first act was dominated by Auger-Aliassime.
He broke Nadal in the third game of the match and used his serve—especially the wide one in the deuce court—his forehand, his drop shot, and his net game to win the first set.
FAA played above-the-net tennis, while Nadal was mired behind the baseline.

Djokovic has won 30 of those matches, but the red clay at Roland Garros is a home court for Nadal.
The tennis world keeps looking for forehead wrinkles, reading glasses and an occasional hitch in his git-along.
Novak Djokovic plays a shot during his first-round win over Yoshihito Nishioka at the French Open on Monday.
No less than Bjorn Borg once famously said that Nadal “played every point like it was match point.”Rafael Nadal celebrates after defeating Corentin Moutet in the second round at the French Open on Wednesday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadPARIS — It took every shot in Rafael Nadal’s repertoire, total conviction and considerable “suffering,” as the Spaniard put it, to reach the French Open quarterfinals.
At this stage in his hard-slugging career, the injuries and ailments are baggage he carries that he didn’t have in 2005, when he won his first French Open title just days after his 19th birthday.
Djokovic holds a 30-28 career edge on Nadal, but Nadal leads 19-8 on clay.
Djokovic won their most recent meeting on the tricky surface, ousting Nadal in the 2021 French Open semifinals en route to claiming the title for a second time.
But the ninth-seeded Auger-Aliassime, who was seeking his fourth consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal appearance, weathered the Spaniard’s best.
