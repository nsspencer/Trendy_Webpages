In English, this comes out as, "José Reynoso, father of my friend and colleague Arelis Reynoso, passed away this morning and grandfather of the star NBA player Al Horford."
Horford will likely do everything in his power to win Game 7 on Sunday night for his grandfather.
Our thoughts are with Al and his family during this difficult time.

     Al Horford Played In Game 6 Against The Miami Heat Following The Death Of His Grandfather
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Credit: Brian Fluharty-USA TODAY SportsThe Boston Celtics are looking to close out the NBA Eastern Conference Finals in Game 7 against the Miami Heat.
Celtics' Al Horford had a very disappointing game, scoring his first and only points of the game with a three in the fourth quarter.
It seems that Horford was playing with a lot on his mind, as his grandfather passed away prior to Game 6.
Horford is still in the grieving process but is having a solid performance in the winner-take-all Game 7.
Horford played all 12 minutes of the quarter and has 3 points, 2 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 steal, and 1 block already in this game.

     Summary: BOSTON -- It took him 15 seasons and 141 playoff games, but Al Horford is finally heading to the NBA Finals.
I'm proud to share this with a veteran, a mentor, a brother, a guy like Al Horford.
Horford, who will turn 36 the day after playing in his first NBA Finals game, scored just five points in Game 7.
Brad Stevens saved Horford from NBA purgatory over the summer, bringing him back to Boston to be the glue to hold the team together.
And now, after 1,090 regular and postseason games, Horford is getting his first chance to become an NBA champion.

     Former Sixers big man Al Horford makes Finals as Celtics beat Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Sixers All-Star Andre Iguodala is headed to the Finals once again as the Golden State Warriors knocked off the Dallas Mavericks and he will be joined there by another former Sixer, Al Horford.
The spacing was terrible and Horford was traded in the 2021 offseason to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Danny Green.
Horford had five points and 13 rebounds as he was big on the defensive end.
Another former Sixer, Heat star Jimmy Butler had 35 points and nine rebounds to keep Miami in the game a bit.
The Sixers will now look to chase the Celtics in the 2022-23 season as they also look to make a Finals run of their own.
