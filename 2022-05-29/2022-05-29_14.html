     Summary: Gujarat captain Hardik Pandya conjured up a stellar all-round display as his team clinched the low-scoring final with 11 balls to spare.
Pandya (3-17) led by example with the ball, claiming the crucial wickets of counterpart Sanju Samson, opener Buttler and Rajasthan's middle-order lynchpin Shimron Hetmyer.
Gujarat lost Wriddhiman Saha and Matthew Wade cheaply but Pandya combined with Shubman Gill in a 63-run stand to help Gujarat overcome a slow start.
"Exceeded all my expectation for the season apart from today," Buttler said.

Pandya grabbed three for17 with impeccable medium-fast bowling to restrict Rajasthan to 130 for nine after Sanju Samson won the toss and chose to bat.
Pandya had Shimron Hetmyer (11) caught off his own bowling in the last ball of a terrific four-over spell.

In seven seasons for Mumbai in the IPL, Hardik had scored his runs at a strike rate of 153.91.
If you have watched Hardik bat over the years, you wouldn't be surprised by his success in his new role.
When he next plays T20Is for India, he'll probably get to play that sort of role, batting at No.
