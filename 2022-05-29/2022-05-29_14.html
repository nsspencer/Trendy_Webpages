     Celtics’ Marcus Smart available for Game 7 against Heat as Boston looks to advance to NBA Finals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MIAMI — The Celtics are still one win away from the NBA Finals as they’ll have their second and final shot to overcome the Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals.
Boston will have both Marcus Smart and Robert Williams available in Game 7 against the Heat, the team announced pregame.
Smart suffered the right ankle sprain in Game 3 against the Heat, which also forced him to miss Game 4 of the series.
The Celtics haven’t been to the NBA Finals since 2010, when they lost in seven games to the Lakers.
But they have a matured core led by Smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and others as they look for the NBA Finals berth.

     Summary: "Every team knows we are trying to go to Jayson and Jaylen and every team is programmed and studies to stop Jayson and Jaylen," Smart said at the time.
When Marcus Smart felt this team would be DIFFERENT @tvabby pic.twitter.com/QrhRUVLm7S — Celtics on NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSCeltics) May 30, 2022Clearly, the Celtics turned things around, but it was hardly right away.
Since that game, the Celtics have gone 45-16 (including the postseason) and are just four wins away from capturing the franchise's 18th title and first since 2008.
"Everybody counted us out early in the season and everybody jumped back on the bandwagon when we started getting things clicking," Smart said.
"Like [Jaylen Brown] said, the energy is about to shift, and he wasn't lying."
