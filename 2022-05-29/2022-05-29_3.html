     Marcus Ericsson wins Indianapolis 500 after restart sets up sprint to the finish
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Marcus Ericsson of Honda survived a late challenge to win the Indy 500 on Sunday and earned the rights to the coveted Borg-Warner Trophy and to celebrate on the podium with a traditional bottle of milk.
Ericsson was up 3 seconds with 5 laps to go and flying to a win when Jimmie Johnson crashed into the wall, causing a red flag that temporarily stopped the race and set up a final sprint to the finish.
On the restart, Ericsson fought off an encroaching Pato O'Ward to win the race for the first time in his career.
In a post-race interview, Ericsson said he had to refocus for the restart but knew he could still take the checkered flag.
"I had to do everything there and then to keep them behind," he said.

     Summary: Marcus Ericsson held off Pato O’Ward in that shootout, with Tony Kanaan finishing third.
Ericsson became the second Swedish driver to win the Indy 500, following Kenny Brack (1999).
O’Ward, a 23-year-old Mexican widely viewed as having a bright future in the sport, was looking for his second win of the year and his fourth since 2021.
He previously won the Indy 500 from the pole in 2008.
That remains the one victory in the event for Dixon, a 41-year-old citizen of New Zealand who lives in Indianapolis.
