     Tennis-Impressive Djokovic canters into French Open last eight, Nadal clash looms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Julien PretotPARIS (Reuters) – Novak Djokovic showed glimpses of his brilliant best to demolish Diego Schwartzman 6-1 6-3 6-3 on Sunday and book his place in the French Open quarter-finals where he is likely to face 13-times champion Rafael Nadal.
The world number one’s pace was too much for Argentine Schwartzman, who barely threatened despite enjoying a 3-0 lead in the second set.
From then on it was a one-way street for Serbian Djokovic, who won 12 of the remaining 15 games on a chilly Court Suzanne Lenglen.
He raced through it, barely troubled by his opponent’s drop shots and almost managing to get the extra shot.
Schwartzman showed signs of frustration when Djokovic left him red-faced with a delightful drop shot to go 3-2 up in the third.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris (AFP) – Novak Djokovic set up a possible quarter-final meeting with old rival Rafael Nadal at the French Open with an impressive straight-sets victory over Diego Schwartzman on Sunday.
Djokovic took his head-to-head record against Argentinian Schwartzman to 7-0 with a clinical display, in which he saved seven of the eight break points he faced.
He is into a 16th French Open quarter-final and has not failed to reach that stage since 2009.
The Serbian star saved two break points in the third game of the match before racing through the opening set.
Schwartzman saved a match point in game eight to force Djokovic to serve it out, which he did, to love.

More infoRafael Nadal' s right knee started bleeding after he took a tumble when trying to return one of Felix Auger-Aliassime's shots early in the second set of their fourth-round clash.
Nadal rolled onto the clay of Court-Philippe Chatrier when he was wrong-footed by the ninth seed while serving at 1-1 in the second set.
The 13-time French Open champion cleaned himself up quickly before the next point and was back to it, not requiring medical attention with the bloodflow stemmed.
It came after Nadal lost the first set 6-3 in almost an hour - the first set he has dropped all tournament.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: World number one and defending champion Novak Djokovic reached a 16th French Open quarter-final on Sunday where old rival and 13-time winner Rafael Nadal could be waiting.
Djokovic, bidding to equal Nadal's record of 21 Grand Slam titles, eased to a 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 last-16 victory against 15th seed Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.
He's a good person off the court," said Djokovic who has now beaten Schwartzman seven times in seven meetings.
Djokovic is still to drop a set at Roland Garros after cruising through the first week.
Toni coached his nephew for the best part of three decades during which time Nadal won 16 of his record 21 Slam titles.
