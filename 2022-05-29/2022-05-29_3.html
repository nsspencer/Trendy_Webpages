     Summary: The Food and Drug Administration is investigating a hepatitis A outbreak in the U.S. and Canada linked to strawberries sold at Walmart, Safeway, Trader Joe's and other major grocery stores.
Driving the news: There have been 17 cases of Hepatitis A and 12 hospitalizations linked to the strawberries in the U.S., the FDA said.
Fifteen of the cases came from California, while the other two came from Minnesota and North Dakota.
