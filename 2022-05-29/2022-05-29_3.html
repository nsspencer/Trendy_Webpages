     It’s Djokovic vs. Nadal, the French Open Rematch We’ve Been Waiting For
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS — As the kids like to say these days, it’s on.
Far sooner than many may have hoped, Novak Djokovic, the reigning French Open champion, will take on Rafael Nadal, a 13-time champion at Roland Garros, in a quarterfinal match on Tuesday, the first rematch of two of the leading men’s players since their epic semifinal last June.
It took some of Nadal’s greatest tennis to survive a five-set, four-hour, 21-minute thriller Sunday evening against Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada, but the match that so many crave is on the horizon.
“A huge challenge and probably the biggest one that you can have here in Roland Garros,” Djokovic said, anticipating Nadal, after his fourth straight-sets win, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3, a pummeling of Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.
“I’m ready for it.”Perhaps more than Nadal, who survived one of the great scares of his storied French Open career against Auger-Aliassime, the athletic and tireless Canadian with a booming serve and big forehand.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nadal will hope he can recover in time from the gruelling contest for his next outing, where the reigning champion awaits for their 59th career showdown.
The Spaniard, who will turn 36 on Friday, has lifted the Musketeers’ Cup a record 13 times but was ousted in the semi-finals last year by Djokovic.
The clash on Court Philippe Chatrier was the second meeting between Nadal and Auger-Aliassime but the first since Toni Nadal began working with the Canadian in 2021.
After an early trade of service breaks, Auger-Aliassime broke Nadal’s delivery a second time to take the contest to a deciding fifth set.
The last time Nadal played a five-setter at Roland Garros was in the 2013 semi-final, when he beat Djokovic.

This five-set match played out in five acts, as the two traded the momentum back and forth every 10 games or soThe first act was dominated by Auger-Aliassime.
He broke Nadal in the third game of the match and used his serve—especially the wide one in the deuce court—his forehand, his drop shot, and his net game to win the first set.
FAA played above-the-net tennis, while Nadal was mired behind the baseline.
