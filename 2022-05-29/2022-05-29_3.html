     Chick-fil-A Required To Address Parking, Traffic Issues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With customers reporting 1-2 hour waits for food, Chick-fil-A brought in local sheriff’s deputies to help direct traffic and temporarily prohibited left-turn movements on the property.
Jason Hill, who works for Chick-fil-A in new store construction, told planning commissioners the restaurant chain thought the hotel would be built in a similar timeframe as Chick-fil-A.
“We leased this property…specifically under the auspices that this would be co-developed with a hotel that had a shared parking agreement,” he said.
However, Chick-fil-A representatives told planning commissioners they are committed to working with the township and resolving the issues as quickly as possible.
Sych said that any kind of long-term solutions Chick-fil-A does consider will likely prevent a hotel from being built.
