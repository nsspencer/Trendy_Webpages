     After a Late Red Flag, a Thrilling Sprint to the Indy 500 Finish
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What seemed like an easy, sure victory turned into one of the most dramatic finishes in recent memory, as Marcus Ericsson held on after a late restart to win the 106th running of the Indianapolis 500.
With five laps to go, Ericsson, a 31-year-old Swedish driver, held a nearly three-second lead on Pato O’Ward, the 23-year-old Mexican driver for Arrow McLaren SP.
But a late crash by Jimmie Johnson, the seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion who was racing in his first Indianapolis 500, brought out a red flag that stopped the race with four laps left.
In a two-lap shootout after the restart, Ericsson wove left and right to disrupt the slipstream and fight off an intense charge from O’Ward to take the checkered flag.
“I knew the car was fast enough, but it was still hard,” Ericsson told NBC after the race.

     Summary: May 29, 2022 at 9:09 PM EDT“Don’t worry if you’re not a gearhead,” my editor told me after hiring me as a columnist at the Indianapolis Star in 2000.
“You’ll figure it out.”Twenty-two races later, the most recent being Sunday’s 106th running of the Indianapolis 500 under azure skies, I still haven’t fully figured it out — but I know just enough to be dangerous.
I wondered years ago, would I really get into it, care about it, learn to enjoy it like so many born-and-bred Hoosiers?
Would a stick-and-ball guy (or in my case, stick-and-puck guy) learn to truly appreciate the pageantry and the sensory overload and the raw speed and courage central to this sport?
The answer is yes, yes, yes, a thousand times yes.

     Marcus Ericsson wins Indianapolis 500 after restart sets up sprint to the finish
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Marcus Ericsson of Honda survived a late challenge to win the Indy 500 on Sunday and earned the rights to the coveted Borg-Warner Trophy and to celebrate on the podium with a traditional bottle of milk.
Ericsson was up 3 seconds with 5 laps to go and flying to a win when Jimmie Johnson crashed into the wall, causing a red flag that temporarily stopped the race and set up a final sprint to the finish.
On the restart, Ericsson fought off an encroaching Pato O'Ward to win the race for the first time in his career.
In a post-race interview, Ericsson said he had to refocus for the restart but knew he could still take the checkered flag.
"I had to do everything there and then to keep them behind," he said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marcus Ericsson held off Pato O’Ward in that shootout, with Tony Kanaan finishing third.
Ericsson became the second Swedish driver to win the Indy 500, following Kenny Brack (1999).
O’Ward, a 23-year-old Mexican widely viewed as having a bright future in the sport, was looking for his second win of the year and his fourth since 2021.
He previously won the Indy 500 from the pole in 2008.
That remains the one victory in the event for Dixon, a 41-year-old citizen of New Zealand who lives in Indianapolis.

     Summary: Ericsson: I had to put everything on the line to win Indy 500 (2:19)INDIANAPOLIS -- Marcus Ericsson had to leave Formula One to become a global superstar -- a goal achieved Sunday when the Swedish driver won the Indianapolis 500.
It is the fifth Indy 500 win for team owner Chip Ganassi, who caught a ride to the victory podium on the side of Ericsson's car.
Ericsson is the second Swede to win the Indy 500 in 106 runnings, joining 1999 winner Kenny Brack.
Ganassi had not won the 500 in 10 years and sent five legitimate contenders to Indy to end the drought.
Johnson finished 28th in his Indy 500 debut.

     Summary: Ericsson was wearing a helmet painted in honor of his late countryman and F1 legend, Ronnie Peterson, who was known as the "Super Swede."
People around the IndyCar paddock and elsewhere have taken to calling Ericsson by another moniker: the "Sneaky Swede."
That likely would have been where he finished if not for a late gaffe by his teammate, Dixon.
At 24 laps remaining, Dixon pulled in for his final pit stop and made his only mistake on the day: He was going too fast.
"He [Ericsson] was going to put me in the wall if I would have gone for it," O'Ward said.
