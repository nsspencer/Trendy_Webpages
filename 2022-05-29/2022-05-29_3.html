     Marcus Ericsson wins Indianapolis 500 after restart sets up sprint to the finish
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Marcus Ericsson of Honda survived a late challenge to win the Indy 500 on Sunday and earned the rights to the coveted Borg-Warner Trophy and to celebrate on the podium with a traditional bottle of milk.
Ericsson was up 3 seconds with 5 laps to go and flying to a win when Jimmie Johnson crashed into the wall, causing a red flag that temporarily stopped the race and set up a final sprint to the finish.
On the restart, Ericsson fought off an encroaching Pato O'Ward to win the race for the first time in his career.
In a post-race interview, Ericsson said he had to refocus for the restart but knew he could still take the checkered flag.
"I had to do everything there and then to keep them behind," he said.

I just messed up.”Coming out of the final pit cycle, Ericsson had a comfortable three-second lead on O’Ward before the Johnson caution.

     Marcus Ericsson wins wild Indy 500 after Scott Dixon penalty, plenty of crashes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS -- Chip Ganassi has suffered through 10 years of pain at the Indianapolis 500, but the most unlikely victor ended the team owner's drought.
Here's how the ex-Formula 1 driver won the biggest race of his career and surged to the IndyCar points lead on Sunday.
Headed to a likely final shot at a winning pass by O'Ward, Sage Karam crashed on the final lap, sealing Ericsson's first Indy 500 win and Chip Ganassi Racing's first in 10 years (Dario Franchitti, 2012).
By Lap 150, he'd cycled up to 17th but had no way to work his way back into contention.
Lap 147 marked the end of the fourth round of pitstops, with O'Ward leapfrogging Dixon to lead his first chunk of significant laps of the day.
