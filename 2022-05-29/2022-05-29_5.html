     Summary: CategoriesAEW News NEWS TICKERBy Jason Powell, ProWrestling.net Editor (@prowrestlingnet)MJF did not make a scheduled appearance at Saturday’s AEW Double Or Nothing fan fest in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Fightful.com reported that MJF booked a Saturday night flight to New Jersey at one point, but Mike Johnson of PWInsider.com reported that MJF was still in Las Vegas as of late Saturday night.
MJF is scheduled to face Wardlow in one of the featured matches at tonight’s AEW Double Or Nothing pay-per-view.
Powell’s POV: The assumption is that this situation is related to an ongoing contractual dispute between MJF and AEW President Tony Khan.
One can only assume that it will be a popular topic at Khan’s post Double Or Nothing media session.

     Wardlow Squashes MJF at AEW Double or Nothing, Earns His Freedom and an AEW Job
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✖Wardlow squashed MJF en route to a victory at the start of Double or Nothing, pummeling his former boss with a Powerbomb Symphony before pinning Max with a single foot across his chest.
Wardlow demanded to be let go of his contract, only for Max to make his life hell by forcing to wrestle numerous hand-picked opponents.
Eventually, Wardlow earned himself a match where he could be free from his contract, but if he lost he'd never be able to officially sign with AEW.

After Friedman was stretchered out of the ring, Tony Schiavone informed him that he was officially "#AllElite" as a member of the roster.

     Summary: Wardlow vs. MJF was in jeopardy at AEW Double or Nothing 2022. Credit: AEWWardlow defeated MJF with 10 power bombs at AEW Double or Nothing 2022.
MJF vs. Wardlow kicked off AEW Double or Nothing 2022 as Maxwell Jacob Friedman’s music played to start the show.
AEW finally ramped up the MJF vs. Wardlow feud in recent months, with Wardlow assisting CM Punk in a win over the top heel at AEW Revolution on March 6.
After a vengeful MJF nixed Wardlow’s entrance music, Wardlow was serenaded by Goldberg-like chants of “Wardlow” for a handful of weeks leading up to AEW Double or Nothing.
“The crazy thing [is] that we did without even realizing it," Wardlow told CBS Sports ahead of AEW Double or Nothing.
