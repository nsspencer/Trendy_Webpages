    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gujarat captain Hardik Pandya conjured up a stellar all-round display as his team clinched the low-scoring final with 11 balls to spare.
Pandya (3-17) led by example with the ball, claiming the crucial wickets of counterpart Sanju Samson, opener Buttler and Rajasthan's middle-order lynchpin Shimron Hetmyer.
Gujarat lost Wriddhiman Saha and Matthew Wade cheaply but Pandya combined with Shubman Gill in a 63-run stand to help Gujarat overcome a slow start.
"Exceeded all my expectation for the season apart from today," Buttler said.

After the auction, who would have thought Hardik could lead this bunch of no-hoppers to the title in their debut season.
Jeetubhai remembers the first time he tried to introduce captaincy to Hardik, just after the second IPL season.
He knows how backing them to be themselves can be a very powerful thing,” the coach says.
During his captaincy stint, he has talked about how bowling coach Ashish Nehra and him are like two peas in a pod in cricketing matters.
