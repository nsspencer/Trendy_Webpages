     Will Antonio Brown play in 2022? Free agent wideout gives definitive stance on NFL plans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Don't expect to see Antonio Brown on the field in 2022.
Speaking with Charly Caruso during a 8oki and Knights of Degen Fan Controlled Football matchup, Brown said not to count on him lacing up his cleats and strapping on his infamous helmet in 2022, saying he might be done:.
Brown: Nah, don't play yourself looking at me to play.
If he doesn't play football, he does has his second career: Brown released his album "Paradigm" in April, and features DaBaby, Young Thug and others.
Brown conveniently released a single off the album on the day he hopped off the field on Jan. 2 during a Jets-Buccaneers matchup.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Antonio Brown hasn't played football since his acrimonious split from the Buccaneers late in the 2021 season.
"Obviously we live the game, but you can't play forever," Brown told Charly Arnolt when asked if football remains a priority for him.
Asked if he'll be back on an NFL field in 2022, Brown was even more direct.
"Nah," he said, "don't play yourself looking (for) me to play."
In truth, Brown isn't necessarily stepping away from the NFL as much as the NFL is stepping away from him.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you were hoping for that reunion between the Pittsburgh Steelers and wide receiver Antonio Brown, this news is going to be disappointing.
The former Steelers star was interviewed during something called a Fan Controlled Football game and said he isn’t planning to play for any team in 2022.
This is in stark contrast to a tweet Brown sent out just days ago noting he wants to retire a Steeler.
57 percent of fans in our poll didn’t want Brown to return to the team just to retire as a member of the Steelers.
Brown had the single greatest six-season stretch in NFL history.
