     Summary: Sign up to receive the best LFC opinion direct to your inboxLiverpool forward Sadio Mané is set to confirm that he will be leaving the club now the season has finished, according to various reports.
It is said that Mané wants a new challenge, with Bayern Munich heavily linked, but Liverpool would need to find a replacement first.
These are the three things that Liverpool.com believes will 'definitely' happen after an announcement is made by the Senegalese.
There would definitely be a clamour from Liverpool fans, who would like a replacement — and that, no doubt, would seem the logical solution — but perhaps that is not guaranteed.
A fond farewellThere is no doubt that Mané departs with plenty of goodwill.

     Sadio Mane transfer: Liverpool star wants to move and Bayern Munich make perfect sense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Romano reports that Bayern Munich are the strongest contenders to sign him.
But what makes Mane, 30, so intriguing for Julian Nagelsmann at Bayern Munich?
Bayern Munich used five different formations this season with the majority of their matches being played from a base 4-2-3-1.
But adding Mane could potentially push Gnabry out the door, depending on the direction the club wants to go in for the attack.
Adding Mane would be a positive start for a team with the talent to return to European supremacy.
