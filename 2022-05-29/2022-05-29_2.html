     Tennis-Impressive Djokovic canters into French Open last eight, Nadal clash looms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Julien PretotPARIS (Reuters) – Novak Djokovic showed glimpses of his brilliant best to demolish Diego Schwartzman 6-1 6-3 6-3 on Sunday and book his place in the French Open quarter-finals where he is likely to face 13-times champion Rafael Nadal.
The world number one’s pace was too much for Argentine Schwartzman, who barely threatened despite enjoying a 3-0 lead in the second set.
From then on it was a one-way street for Serbian Djokovic, who won 12 of the remaining 15 games on a chilly Court Suzanne Lenglen.
He raced through it, barely troubled by his opponent’s drop shots and almost managing to get the extra shot.
Schwartzman showed signs of frustration when Djokovic left him red-faced with a delightful drop shot to go 3-2 up in the third.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Still in the fight for his 14th French Open title, Nadal edged out Auger-Aliassime 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 to reach the quarter-finals.
Throughout the final set, Auger-Aliassime continued to push himself to the limit, serving well and making difficult volleys.
Earlier in the day, Djokovic moved past 15th seed Diego Schwartzman without incident, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3.
“Playing him in Roland Garros is always a physical battle, along with everything else,” said Djokovic.
It’s a huge challenge and probably the biggest one that you can have here in Roland Garros.

     Nadal Survives Felix In Five, Sets Djokovic Blockbuster At Roland Garros
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rafael Nadal won a Roland Garros thriller Sunday when he survived a major scare from Felix Auger-Aliassime to set a blockbuster quarter-final showdown with World No.
One of the best players in the world,” Nadal said when asked about Auger-Aliassime in his on-court interview.
“We know each other well,” Nadal said when looking ahead to his match against Djokovic.
He continued to swing freely at the start of the second set, pulling the Spaniard around the baseline with his precision.
However, after saving two break points on serve at 1-1 in the second set, Nadal started to grow into the match.
