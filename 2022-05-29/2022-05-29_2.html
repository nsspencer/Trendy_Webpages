     After a Late Red Flag, a Thrilling Sprint to the Indy 500 Finish
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What seemed like an easy, sure victory turned into one of the most dramatic finishes in recent memory, as Marcus Ericsson held on after a late restart to win the 106th running of the Indianapolis 500.
With five laps to go, Ericsson, a 31-year-old Swedish driver, held a nearly three-second lead on Pato O’Ward, the 23-year-old Mexican driver for Arrow McLaren SP.
But a late crash by Jimmie Johnson, the seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion who was racing in his first Indianapolis 500, brought out a red flag that stopped the race with four laps left.
In a two-lap shootout after the restart, Ericsson wove left and right to disrupt the slipstream and fight off an intense charge from O’Ward to take the checkered flag.
“I knew the car was fast enough, but it was still hard,” Ericsson told NBC after the race.

     Former F1 driver Marcus Ericsson wins Indianapolis 500 after race stoppage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marcus Ericsson had to leave Formula One to make his name – a goal achieved on Sunday when the Swedish driver won the Indianapolis 500.
Ericsson took control of the famous race late and had it under control for Chip Ganassi Racing until a crash by teammate Jimmie Johnson with four laps remaining brought out a rare red-flag stoppage at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
It is the fifth Indy 500 victory for team owner Chip Ganassi, who caught a ride to the victory podium on the side of Ericsson’s car.
Ericsson is the second Swede to win the Indy 500 in 106 runnings, joining 1999 winner Kenny Brack.
Helio Castroneves, last year’s winner, finished seventh and one spot ahead of Meyer Shank Racing teammate Simon Pagenaud.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Marcus Ericsson of Honda survived a late challenge to win the Indy 500 on Sunday and earned the rights to the coveted Borg-Warner Trophy and to celebrate on the podium with a traditional bottle of milk.
Ericsson was up 3 seconds with 5 laps to go and flying to a win when Jimmie Johnson crashed into the wall, causing a red flag that temporarily stopped the race and set up a final sprint to the finish.
On the restart, Ericsson fought off an encroaching Pato O'Ward to win the race for the first time in his career.
In a post-race interview, Ericsson said he had to refocus for the restart but knew he could still take the checkered flag.
"I had to do everything there and then to keep them behind," he said.
