     Summary: AP Photo/Chris SewardThe Rangers knew they needed a big game from their top stars if they were to beat the Carolina Hurricanes in game seven of their Eastern Conference Semi-Final series.
We took advantage of the power plays early in the hockey game.
Kreider deflected Zibanejad’s shot past Raanta for his 7th of the playoffs and a 2-0 Rangers lead.
By scoring early, the Rangers were able to take the crowd out of the game, something that’s always a point of emphasis for the road team.
It was Strome’s first goal of the series and his second of the playoffs as the Rangers skated off after two with a three goal lead.

Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba followed with a big hit on Carolina rookie center Seth Jarvis, knocking him out of the game with an upper-body injury.
