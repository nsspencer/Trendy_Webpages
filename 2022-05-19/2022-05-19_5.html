     Nick Saban comes out swinging: Texas oil money threatens Alabama, Georgia recruiting dominance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama coach Nick Saban officially called out Texas A&amp;M and took a swipe at Jackson State for paying student-athletes to come to their schools to play football.
Saban -- who claims the Tide didn’t pay any of its recruits -- was very much intentional in his remarks, which are sobering:“We were second in recruiting last year.
“Jackson State paid a guy a million dollars last year that was a really good Division I player to come to school.
I don’t think that would be the NCAA’s intention,” Saban said the day before the CFP Championship Game.
“You’re going to have the haves and have-nots and the separations that’s already there is going to grow larger,” Smart said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jackson State football coach Deion Sanders responded to Nick Saban’s comments on Thursday after the Crimson Tide’s football coach criticized Sanders for “paying a player a million dollars” to attend the program.
“I haven’t talked to Coach Saban,” Sanders told ESPN’s Andscape.
With that, Sanders reiterated Hunter is not making more than him as the program’s coach.
“I don’t make a million,” Sanders said.
“Travis [Hunter] ain’t built like that.

     Nick Saban and Jimbo Fisher NIL comments: Live updates, reaction and latest news
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As conversations in college football continues to revolve around name, image and likeness, two of the most notable coaches in the country are sniping back and forth.
Texas A&amp;M coach Jimbo Fisher did not hold back in his response to Alabama coach Nick Saban's comments on Wednesday that the Aggies finished first in recruiting last season because the program "bought" players through NIL deals.
It’s really despicable," Fisher said.
"It’s despicable that somebody can say things about somebody and, more importantly, 17-year-old kids.
Saban commented on Texas A&amp;M's recruiting class on Wednesday at an event in Birmingham, Ala."We were second in recruiting last year.

     Nick Saban apologizes for comments levied at Jimbo Fisher and Texas A&amp;M football program
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I should’ve never really singled anyone out," Saban said during an appearance on Sirius XM College.
Fisher labeled Saban’s comments “despicable,” called him a “narcissist” and, in one of the most remarkable broadsides levied between two high-profile coaches, suggested that “somebody should have slapped” Saban as a child.
"There is tremendous frustration concerning the absence of consistent rules from state to state related to name, image and likeness.
Saban suggests it could, writes Chase GoodbreadSaban clarified in his radio appearance that he wasn't accusing A&amp;M or Fisher of violating any NCAA or state rules related to NIL.
"I really wasn’t saying that anyone was doing anything illegal in using name, image and likeness.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In this case, the sausage is recruiting, which is greasy enough without attaching a breakfast analogy to it.
You can talk smack about a man's record, playcalling or coaching staff quality, but you better not go there with recruiting.
The NCAA concluded in 2019 that there was "an unconstrained culture of booster involvement in football recruiting."
One man's cheating is another man's recruiting.
What's different is NIL revealed a black market economy that is now more or less allowed and above board.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The verbal haymakers exchanged by Alabama's Nick Saban and Texas A&amp;M's Jimbo Fisher the past 24 hours can best be summed up as the most appropriate possible soundtrack for 2022.
His old assistant, Fisher, held nothing back in response, including suggesting that "somebody should have slapped" Saban.
As Finebaum himself noted during his SEC Network show on Thursday, Fisher used the word "despicable" 15 times in his rant.
Don't expect too many smiles the next time Jimbo Fisher and Nick Saban get together.
It will echo on through the fall and well beyond, until there's definitive rules and folks in charge competent enough to enforce them.
