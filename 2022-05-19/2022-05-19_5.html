     Emmy Rossum Weighs In on the Mystery of L.A. Icon ‘Angelyne’ (VIDEO)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Icons come and icons go, but few of them linger as long as L.A. glam-oddity Angelyne.
Unlike the modern TMI influencers she’s, well, influenced, Angelyne was rigidly secretive and socially elusive, a unicorn by way of camp filmmaker Russ Meyers.
“That, I found so fascinating,” agreed Shameless alum Emmy Rossum during our recent chat.
Legitimately unrecognizable as the pop-culture creation at the center of Peacock‘s terrifically engaging mini-series, Rossum found her role as the bombshell just as intriguing.
Like the woman herself, Angelyne never really says, but in Rossum’s hands, she’s definitely someone you want to know either way.

     'Angelyne' review: Emmy Rossum stars in Peacock's two-dimensional look at the 'billboard queen'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) "Angelyne" approximates its subject in the wrong ways: It's big, attention-getting and has all the depth of a billboard.
Emmy Rossum stars and produced this limited series, which doesn't profess to be truth but rather a facsimile of it.
In a year that's already given the world the superior "Pam &amp; Tommy," consider this evidence that impressive makeup alone isn't enough.
The main problem is that the opening episodes do little to inspire the patience to stick around to find out.
Rossum speaks in a honeyed voice as she disappears into the role, mastering an attention-commanding strut even before the character acquires her oversized cleavage.

     ‘Angelyne’ Star Emmy Rossum on Advice She Received from the Real-Life Billboard Queen
    </h2>

     Summary: There was also a sit-down meeting with the woman herself, who had some early involvement in the series but was out by the time production began.
“She understood the power of her image and the fierce control and preservation that that living, breathing performance art needs to survive.
“It’s so weird because I had a meeting with Emmy before we started shooting, and that was the last time I saw Emmy until we wrapped,” he said.
“She kept up that attitude even off camera and it was sort of intimidating, as my character and as myself, to interact with her.
She has this presence as Angelyne the billboard queen.”Angelyne is now streaming on Peacock.
