     Summary: The data error misplaced vaccinations of Tennessee residents who live in ZIP codes that straddle more than one county and incorrectly attributed all vaccinations in those areas to whichever county contains most of the ZIP code.
Schaffner wondered: What if Meigs County gave Tennessee leaders misplaced confidence in rural vaccination efforts?
When told of the data error, some lamented the county’s once-enviable rate.
The health department stopped waiting for that software update on April 1 and tasked its staff with geocoding vaccination data to the correct counties.
The Department of Health declined to provide any official to discuss the data error in detail or answer further questions.
