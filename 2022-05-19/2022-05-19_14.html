     Summary: Welcome to the penultimate game of the season, on the 10th Anniversary of our historic first Champions League triumph.
It’s a day to celebrate and reminisce, and also hopefully take in some football fun.
We do technically need one more point to guarantee a third place finish, but that’s academic at this point.
Tuchel talked about looking for players who are fit and still hungry to play, so we have just a couple changes from the FA Cup final, with Ziyech and Kanté coming in.
Here we go!

     Summary: Marcos Alonso's goal against Leicester all but ensures Chelsea will finish third in the Premier League this season.
Getty ImagesChelsea defender Marco Alonso scored a glorious equaliser to earn a 1-1 home draw with Leicester City on Thursday and effectively seal third place in the Premier League ahead of the final round of fixtures.
The draw lifted Chelsea to 71 points, 19 behind leaders Manchester City and three ahead of Tottenham Hotspur in fourth, but Chelsea's far superior goal difference means Spurs have no realistic chance of overtaking them.
"We created enough to win, didn't allow transition and chances for Leicester, so I am fine with the performance.
Chelsea round off their league campaign at home to relegated Watford on Sunday when Leicester, who are in ninth place on 49 points, host Southampton.

     Summary: But I’m sure he, like everyone else associated with the club, will be happy to put this season in the rearview mirror.
Here is the gambling guide for the match between Chelsea and Leicester CityWhile Chelsea supporters will certainly be feeling fatigued after the rollercoaster that was 2021/22, fans of the Foxes are likely carrying a similar sentiment.
Leicester City is one of the strangest sides in the Premier League this season.
Both teams to find the back of the net at -135 odds is a pretty strong play, in my opinion.
I’m really not seeing either side go all-out with nothing left to play for, though, so I like the under at -170.

     What Todd Boehly did after Chelsea goal vs Leicester as Thiago Silva frustration becomes clear
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a quiet Stamford Bridge before kick-off on Thursday night.
For a second successive Premier League match at Stamford Bridge, Boehly was in attendance to watch his soon-to-be new side.
Chelsea supporters on social media were pleased to see how much the moment meant to Boehly, who was clearly delighted.
Earlier in the campaign, the 37-year-old defender penned a one-year contract extension, so thankfully for Blues supporters, he will once again be playing his football at Stamford Bridge next term.
Chelsea needed Jorginho to drop deep more often and collect the ball from Silva to then try and start an attack for the hosts.

     Chelsea vs Leicester City: Player ratings and analysis after Blues limp to draw to all-but secure third
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea 1-1 Leicester City (Alonso 34’ | Maddison 6’)At least Chelsea succeeded in meeting their final target available to them this term.
The Leicester playmaker pushed forward before striking a curling shot from outside the penalty area that beat Edouard Mendy at the goalkeeper’s near post.
Chelsea’s response was initially muted although Trevoh Chalobah drew a fine save from Schmeichel with a long-range shot.
Tuchel’s side began to dominate the game and created a succession of chances that should have brought the winning goal.
Ziyech twice brought Schmeichel into action and Lukaku should have done much better than send a header wide.
