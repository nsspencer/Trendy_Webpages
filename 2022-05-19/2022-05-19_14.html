     Summary: The data error misplaced vaccinations of Tennessee residents who live in ZIP codes that straddle more than one county and incorrectly attributed all vaccinations in those areas to whichever county contains most of the ZIP code.
Schaffner wondered: What if Meigs County gave Tennessee leaders misplaced confidence in rural vaccination efforts?
When told of the data error, some lamented the county’s once-enviable rate.
The health department stopped waiting for that software update on April 1 and tasked its staff with geocoding vaccination data to the correct counties.
The Department of Health declined to provide any official to discuss the data error in detail or answer further questions.

     Five-Star Pass Rusher Announces Tennessee Visit Plans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Five-star Chandavian Bradley plans to visit Tennessee next week, the talented pass rusher announced on Twitter Wednesday night.
4 edge rusher according to the 247sports composite rankings.
The 6-foot-5, 210 pound pass rusher hasn’t released a top group but has been on a handful of visits since the NCAA lifted its COVID-19 limitations last June.
The five-star pass rusher visited both Missouri and Texas A&amp;M in April and has an official visit to Texas A&amp;M set up for September.
Josh Heupel and defensive line coach Rodney Garner landing the long pass rusher would be a major coup for the Vols, allowing Tennessee to pair of the five-star with blue-chip recruit Caleb Herring.

Ron Rice was all of them.
But not before putting together several lifetimes-worth of jet-setting fun and games, including his annual Miss Hawaiian Tropic contests (from 1983-2010), which began in Daytona Beach before going nationwide and around the globe.
1 Hawaiian Tropic Oldsmobile in the ’79 Daytona 500 when he famously wrecked (and later fought) with Cale Yarborough on the final lap.
“You ask me what it’s like to be Ron Rice,” he once told a TV interviewer.
