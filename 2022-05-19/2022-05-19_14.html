     Summary: And the football team is finally giving Vols fans reason to feel good about the direction of the program.
ESPN’s Football Power Index predicts that the Vols will win 7 games in the 2022 regular season, matching their total from 2021.
2 receiverA big reason for Tennessee’s success in 2021 was the emergence of Cedric Tillman as their top pass-catching option.
Defenses play catch upThere was already a lot of film for defenses to examine with regards to Josh Heupel’s offense.
If Tennessee’s opponents have learned anything, especially those UT plays again that have firsthand knowledge of the system from 2021, UT might not put up record-breaking offensive numbers again.

     Summary: The data error misplaced vaccinations of Tennessee residents who live in ZIP codes that straddle more than one county and incorrectly attributed all vaccinations in those areas to whichever county contains most of the ZIP code.
Schaffner wondered: What if Meigs County gave Tennessee leaders misplaced confidence in rural vaccination efforts?
When told of the data error, some lamented the county’s once-enviable rate.
The health department stopped waiting for that software update on April 1 and tasked its staff with geocoding vaccination data to the correct counties.
The Department of Health declined to provide any official to discuss the data error in detail or answer further questions.
