     ‘Men’ Review: Putting the ‘Male’ in Malevolent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A resident of London, she arrives in the Cotswolds fresh from a horrific experience that will be expanded in periodic flashbacks.
The gist is clear enough right away: After an argument during which he bloodied her nose, Harper’s husband, James (Paapa Essiedu), died, apparently by suicide.
But “Men,” for all its attention to her state of mind — and in spite of Buckley’s exquisitely sensitive performance — isn’t really a psychological thriller.
It’s committed to the literal reality and symbolic meaning of events that occur in an uncanny zone between the ordinary and the supernatural.
Harper is alarmed by this intrusion, but seems not to notice that all the men she encounters share the same face.

     Alex Garland explains how Attack on Titan shaped his horror movie Men
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a Q&amp;A after the world premiere of the startling new horror movie Men, writer-director Alex Garland (Annihilation, Ex Machina) caused a minor social media sensation when he said he’d taken some inspiration from the anime series Attack on Titan, which he was still in the process of watching.
After the film’s premiere, Polygon spoke with Garland about how he came to watch Attack on Titan and what it’s meant to him.
I was just really, really impressed.
“The truth is that any time you see something really good, it encourages you to just try harder, think harder, do better,” he says.
“You know, it’s difficult — when you see other people’s stuff and it’s really good, you’ve sort of got two choices,” he says.

     ‘Men’: There’s more than one message in horror film’s disturbing, inventive imagery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rated R (for disturbing and violent content, graphic nudity, grisly images and language).
What we know for sure is, the messaging about spirituality and organized religions and gender-based mythology and mental illness and toxic masculinity runs deep.
Through the wonders of makeup and prosthetics and, in at least one case, CGI, Rory Kinnear plays all of the aforementioned male characters (and a few more).
Each represents a threat to Harper on one level or another, as she finds herself intimidated, harassed and perhaps in mortal danger.
It’s going to take every ounce of her resolve to outlast these beastly men.

There are a lot of men like him in “Men,” and I again mean that literally.
(Watch the windows in “Men” carefully, both for the frightening visions they reveal and the equally eerie images they reflect back.)
Rory Kinnear in the movie “Men.” (Kevin Baker)Harper is thus both empowered and disempowered; she’s a fighter, a survivor and sometimes a passive observer.
While “Men” shares plenty of thematic DNA with its predecessors, its gender politics are both more overt and more opaque.

If you have come looking for answers to what on Earth that whole ending was about, you’re in the right place.
Seriously, this is your final warning as I am going to spoil everything that occurs at the end of the film.
The reason Harper is here is that her abusive ex-husband James (Paapa Essiedu) died after she tried to divorce him.

“Why Black men?

     Grotesque Interviews With Hideous ‘Men’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Men starts with the end of a relationship, and it’s a breakup with a body count.
There’s more than a little bit of Annihiliation’s sinister lyricism in Men, which also takes place against a possibly enchanted pastoral backdrop, and which actually surpasses its predecessor on the level of grotesque special effects.
In Men, Harper is alone by choice and the woods around the estate are unambiguously beautiful—a verdant symphony of greens—but in time, the same fraught gender dynamics emerge.
It’s not really a spoiler to say that Kinnear plays multiple roles in Men: The trailer contains images of the actor in a half-dozen different guises.
If the ending of Men is meant to be funny, that mission is accomplished well enough.
