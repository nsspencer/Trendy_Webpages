     Quavo Dodges Questions About Offset, Migos Break-Up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Play video content BACKGRIDQuavo and Offset are on the outs again, and this time it means Migos is done as a group -- at least that's the online buzz, and Quavo isn't doing anything to put out that fire.
All the talk about Migos' demise stems from 2 things: Quavo's new Offset-less project and a bunch of social media UNfollows.
The new duo's taking the name Unc &amp; Phew, due to their family ties ‚Äî but Quavo deftly dodged the topic of Offset.
Offset and Cardi B stopped following Quavo and Takeoff on Instagram, and Quavo stopped unfollowed Offset and Cardi.
Quavo isn't saying, which makes us lean toward this being a skillful marketing scheme for Unc &amp; Phew.
