     Summary: That was in February, when LeBron was passive-aggressively putting pressure on the Lakers from every direction.
But his intention to play with Bronny?
God willing 🙏🏾🤞🏾 — LeBron James (@KingJames) May 17, 2022There’s approximately a 1-in-30 chance the Lakers land Bronny.
But other teams also have desire to get Bronny and lure LeBron.
In all likelihood, LeBron will have to choose between playing for the Lakers and playing with Bronny.
