     Cannes: James Gray, Anne Hathaway Moved to Tears During ‘Armageddon Time’ Premiere
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anne Hathaway, Director James Gray, Jeremy Strong, Jaylin Webb and Michael Banks Repeta attend the screening of "Armageddon Time" during the 75th annual Cannes film festival at Palais des Festivals on May 19, 2022 in Cannes, France.
James Gray brought his deeply personal and intimate family story Armageddon Time — a film set in the 1980s and featuring Trump family members as characters — to the Cannes Film Festival Thursday night where it received a warm six-minute standing ovation.
By the end of the applause, Gray and several stars of the film including Anne Hathaway were in tears.
It contained a trenchant critique of the conservative politics of the era, with actors playing members of Donald Trump’s family, including Fred Trump Sr., Donald’s father, and Mary Anne Trump, Donald’s sister.
In one scene, Mary Anne, played by Jessica Chastain, delivers a pointed speech inside a private school auditorium about self-reliance.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

Hathaway and Strong play solid a Jewish couple with dreams of upward mobility.

     “Armageddon Time,” Reviewed: A New York Childhood in the Crucible of American History
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The film is James Gray’s “Armageddon Time,” which is of local and national interest, and which makes the connection between the local and the national its very subject.
But Paul’s main emotional connection is with his grandfather, Aaron (Anthony Hopkins), a British-Jewish immigrant whose mother was born in Ukraine.
It’s clear that Aaron is the only member of the family who gets the idiosyncratic, dreamy, and impulsive child.
They become fast friends, and Paul also becomes aware of the gross inequality in their financial and family circumstances.
For all the film’s roiling action, its inner life is in little grace notes that open enormous vistas of time.
