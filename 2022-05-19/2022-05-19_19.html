     ‘Men’ Review: Putting the ‘Male’ in Malevolent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A resident of London, she arrives in the Cotswolds fresh from a horrific experience that will be expanded in periodic flashbacks.
The gist is clear enough right away: After an argument during which he bloodied her nose, Harper’s husband, James (Paapa Essiedu), died, apparently by suicide.
But “Men,” for all its attention to her state of mind — and in spite of Buckley’s exquisitely sensitive performance — isn’t really a psychological thriller.
It’s committed to the literal reality and symbolic meaning of events that occur in an uncanny zone between the ordinary and the supernatural.
Harper is alarmed by this intrusion, but seems not to notice that all the men she encounters share the same face.

     Men Is an Excellent Movie and I Have No Idea Who It’s For
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Men seems doomed to suffer a similar fate.
The movie begins as Harper (Jessie Buckley) arrives in a picturesque cottage town, hoping to emotionally recover following the death of her ex-husband.
Many women already know, all too viscerally, the “sense of horror” Garland recreates onscreen.
The film feels designed to head off arguments from those who would be dismissive of what it has to say.
(If you were confused by the ending of Annihilation, this movie will do you only slightly more favors.)

     ‘Men’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alex Garland has a way of crafting intricate, off-the-wall films whose impressive atmospheric tensions tend to outweigh what's actually taking place in them.
If "Annihilation" is the most egregious version of his tendency toward drifting into narrative esoterica, "Men" makes more of an attempt to use his style as a cudgel.
She goes to the local pub, runs into Geoffrey, who insists on buying her a drink from the barkeep (Rory Kinnear), as the constable (Rory Kinnear) walks in and casually informs her the naked stalker (Rory Kinnear) whom she had to deal with earlier, was just let free.
The film may have an abundance of interpersonal political venom about the imbalanced power dynamic between men and women -- along with its abundance of body-horror imagery and biblical allusions to Eve, the apple, and the slithering deceiver who convinces her to go against her nature -- but its hiss is worse than its bite.

     Estrogen may play a role in making Covid less deadly for women than men
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's one of the pandemic's prolonged mysteries: Why have men died of Covid at higher rates than women?
Wilcox added that "a number of studies have shown that higher estrogen levels seem to be associated with lower severity from infectious diseases in general."
The new research also aligns with a 2020 study that found that hormone replacement therapy cut the Covid fatality risk in half among women over 50.
Hormone replacement therapy comes with risks of its own, since long-term use may increase the chances of stroke, blood clots or heart attack.
At the least, Wilcox said, his study suggests that there is no need to for women who get Covid to discontinue their hormone replacement therapy.

     Summary: Calling your movie “Men” might qualify as one such mind game, especially in the context of a story where men are total slime — quite literally, in the movie’s spectacularly gooey third act.
There are a lot of men like him in “Men,” and I again mean that literally.
(Watch the windows in “Men” carefully, both for the frightening visions they reveal and the equally eerie images they reflect back.)
Rory Kinnear in the movie “Men.” (Kevin Baker)Harper is thus both empowered and disempowered; she’s a fighter, a survivor and sometimes a passive observer.
While “Men” shares plenty of thematic DNA with its predecessors, its gender politics are both more overt and more opaque.

     Summary: There is also the new A24 film Men from writer-director Alex Garland, known for Ex Machina and Annihilation, that is similarly being unleashed upon the world.
If you have come looking for answers to what on Earth that whole ending was about, you’re in the right place.
Seriously, this is your final warning as I am going to spoil everything that occurs at the end of the film.
The reason Harper is here is that her abusive ex-husband James (Paapa Essiedu) died after she tried to divorce him.
This is a film whose ending clearly is wanting to say something to us beyond a twist ending.

He said he is honored to work with so many “amazing” and “inspiring” Black men.
