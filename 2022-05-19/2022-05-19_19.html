     Riverdale’s Upcoming Seventh Season Will Be Its Last
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After more than 100 episodes filled with sex, cults, speakeasys, and wildly inappropriate high school cheerleading routines, Riverdale is coming to an end.
The CW announced on Thursday that the show’s seventh season, which will air in a midseason slot, shall be its last.
“It was an iconic pop culture star, and we want to make sure it goes out the right way,” he added.
In recent months, some of the show’s stars have hinted that season 7 would be their last without confirming that the show itself was about to end.
As Riverdale has increasingly abandoned logic and embraced its inherent weirdness, here’s to a Jingle Jangle-fueled final season.
