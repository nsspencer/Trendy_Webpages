     ‘Men’ Review: Putting the ‘Male’ in Malevolent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A resident of London, she arrives in the Cotswolds fresh from a horrific experience that will be expanded in periodic flashbacks.
The gist is clear enough right away: After an argument during which he bloodied her nose, Harper’s husband, James (Paapa Essiedu), died, apparently by suicide.
But “Men,” for all its attention to her state of mind — and in spite of Buckley’s exquisitely sensitive performance — isn’t really a psychological thriller.
It’s committed to the literal reality and symbolic meaning of events that occur in an uncanny zone between the ordinary and the supernatural.
Harper is alarmed by this intrusion, but seems not to notice that all the men she encounters share the same face.

     FIFA Picks First Female Officials for Men’s World Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Qatar World Cup was always going to be full of firsts: the first time it will be played in the Middle East; the first time it will be played in November and December.
Now, it may also be the first men’s World Cup tournament in which a game is refereed by a woman.
The most likely candidate among the three to get a starring role is Stéphanie Frappart of France, who has broken a number of barriers in European soccer.
Frappart, who made the list alongside female referees from Rwanda and Japan, has a stellar reputation in European soccer as the first woman to referee men in the Champions League, France’s top division and World Cup qualification games.
This month, she refereed the final of the men’s French Cup.

     ‘Men’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alex Garland has a way of crafting intricate, off-the-wall films whose impressive atmospheric tensions tend to outweigh what's actually taking place in them.
If "Annihilation" is the most egregious version of his tendency toward drifting into narrative esoterica, "Men" makes more of an attempt to use his style as a cudgel.
She goes to the local pub, runs into Geoffrey, who insists on buying her a drink from the barkeep (Rory Kinnear), as the constable (Rory Kinnear) walks in and casually informs her the naked stalker (Rory Kinnear) whom she had to deal with earlier, was just let free.
The film may have an abundance of interpersonal political venom about the imbalanced power dynamic between men and women -- along with its abundance of body-horror imagery and biblical allusions to Eve, the apple, and the slithering deceiver who convinces her to go against her nature -- but its hiss is worse than its bite.

     Review: Alex Garland’s latest freakout delves into the evil that ‘Men’ do
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Calling your movie “Men” might qualify as one such mind game, especially in the context of a story where men are total slime — quite literally, in the movie’s spectacularly gooey third act.
There are a lot of men like him in “Men,” and I again mean that literally.
(Watch the windows in “Men” carefully, both for the frightening visions they reveal and the equally eerie images they reflect back.)
Rory Kinnear in the movie “Men.” (Kevin Baker)Harper is thus both empowered and disempowered; she’s a fighter, a survivor and sometimes a passive observer.
While “Men” shares plenty of thematic DNA with its predecessors, its gender politics are both more overt and more opaque.

If you have come looking for answers to what on Earth that whole ending was about, you’re in the right place.
Seriously, this is your final warning as I am going to spoil everything that occurs at the end of the film.
The reason Harper is here is that her abusive ex-husband James (Paapa Essiedu) died after she tried to divorce him.
This is a film whose ending clearly is wanting to say something to us beyond a twist ending.

     Grotesque Interviews With Hideous ‘Men’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Men starts with the end of a relationship, and it’s a breakup with a body count.
There’s more than a little bit of Annihiliation’s sinister lyricism in Men, which also takes place against a possibly enchanted pastoral backdrop, and which actually surpasses its predecessor on the level of grotesque special effects.
In Men, Harper is alone by choice and the woods around the estate are unambiguously beautiful—a verdant symphony of greens—but in time, the same fraught gender dynamics emerge.
It’s not really a spoiler to say that Kinnear plays multiple roles in Men: The trailer contains images of the actor in a half-dozen different guises.
If the ending of Men is meant to be funny, that mission is accomplished well enough.
