     Fortnite is Available For All GeForce Now Members
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After months of closed beta testing, Fortnite has officially exited beta testing on GeForce Now.
This means all members of Nvidia's cloud gaming service can now stream the popular free-to-play Battle Royale on iOS and Android devices, previously it was available on PC via the native GeForce Now app.
However, Android users opting to play via Xbox Cloud Gaming can only stream Fortnite through a web browser, rather than a dedicated app.
GeForce Now subscribers with an Android device, on the other hand, can play Fortnite on the GeForce Now Android app.
In January, Nvidia made Fortnite available on GeForce Now as a closed beta.

     Now Everyone Can Play Fortnite on iOS With Geforce Now
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a test period that began in January, Nvidia now allows everyone to play Fortnite on mobile with touch controls via GeForce Now -- in other words, it works on the iPhone as well as Android phones.
This follows Microsoft's rollout of free cloud-based Fortnite via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at the beginning of May.
You can play it for free without a GeForce Now subscription, but you're still constrained by the time limits of the free plan -- one hour at a time.
To thank the beta testers, Nvidia's giving them three days of Priority membership.
Existing testers and subscribers can tack the three days onto their existing balance: Just go to Nvidia's redemption site and sign in to your account.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After four months in closed beta, a touchscreen-optimized version of Fortnite is now available to stream via Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service on iOS and Android.
On iOS, GeForce Now is available via the browser, while Android owners can access it via an app.
Like GeForce Now, Xbox Cloud Gaming is only available on iOS via web browsers because of Apple’s restrictions around game streaming services.
Nvidia boasts that its cloud gaming service now includes a library of 1,300 games that are available via a combination of Steam and the Epic Games Store.
Update May 19th, 9:58AM ET: Updated to note that Fortnite’s PC version was previously available to stream via GeForce Now.
