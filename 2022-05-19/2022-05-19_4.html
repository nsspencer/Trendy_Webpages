     George W. Bush condemns ‘unjustified and brutal’ invasion of Iraq in speech mix-up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former President George W. Bush slipped up during a speech on Wednesday about Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, condemning instead the “unjustified and brutal” invasion of Iraq.
“The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq,” Bush said in Dallas.
“I mean, of Ukraine,” he said, before adding, “Iraq, too.
Anyway—”The former president shrugged off his gaffe by making a joke about his age.
Bush’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003 in pursuit of weapons of mass destruction has been widely condemned over the years by critics for being an unjustified invasion.

     ‘I mean Ukraine’: Former President George Bush calls Iraq invasion ‘unjustified’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Former President George W. Bush mistakenly described the invasion of Iraq as “brutal” and “unjustified” before correcting himself to say he meant to refer to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Bush made the comments in a speech during an event in Dallas on Wednesday, while he was criticizing Russia’s political system.
“The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia, and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq,” Bush said, before correcting himself and shaking his head.
In 2003, when Bush was president, the United States led an invasion of Iraq over weapons of mass destruction that were never found.
The former president also compared Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Britain’s wartime leader Winston Churchill, while condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin for launching the invasion of Ukraine in February.

     Trying to condemn the war in Ukraine, Bush inadvertently calls Iraq war unjustified
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trying to condemn the war in Ukraine, Bush inadvertently calls Iraq war unjustifiedFormer President George W. Bush was criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday when his old nemesis, the verbal slip, struck again.
Bush eventually condemned Putin's invasion of Ukraine — but not before he condemned "a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq."
Bush was drawing a parallel between how countries conduct elections and their stance toward other nations when his tongue went rogue.
"The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia, and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq — I mean of Ukraine," Bush said.
In Thursday's speech, Bush was comparing the free and fair election of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Putin's suppression of his political opponents.

The fight: A slowly regenerating Russian army is making incremental gains in eastern Ukraine against valiant but underequipped Ukrainian forces.
The United States and its allies are racing to deliver the enormous quantities of weaponry the Ukrainians urgently need if they are to hold the Russians at bay.
The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies.
Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

     George W. Bush Flubs, Equates Putin's Invasion of Ukraine to His Invasion of Iraq
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Play video contentIt's maybe the most incredible gaffe of the year -- and that's saying something -- former President George W. Bush tried to take aim at Vladimir Putin, and it boomeranged right back on him.
W. was speaking at SMU's George W. Bush Institute when he groused about Putin's invasion of Ukraine ... he was trying to say the war was the brainchild of a tyrant who brazenly invaded a neighboring country without any justification.
The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq."
Now check this out ... if you listen closely, after Bush corrects himself, he says, "Iraq too."
That's an incredible statement, because that puts him in the seat of the aggressor without justification.
