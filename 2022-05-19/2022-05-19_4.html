     NHL Playoffs 2022: Flames set record with fastest two goals to begin playoff game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Flames were able to record the fastest two goals ever to open a playoff game when they lit the lamp twice in the opening 51 seconds of the first period for an early advantage.
In addition, the two opening goals were just 25 seconds apart, which is the sixth-fastest time that two playoff goals were scored in Flames history.
That record is 14 seconds, which was set by Backlund and Matthew Tkachuk in Game 1 of the First Round back in 2019.
Only two teams in NHL history have registered two goals to start any playoff period in fewer than 51 seconds.
Tkachuk became the first Flames player since Theo Fleury in 1995 to record a playoff hat trick.

     Summary: Game 1 had everything we were looking for in the Battle of Alberta and more.
The Calgary Flames beat the Edmonton Oilers 9-6 after giving up a 3-0 lead.
Old school hockey fans loved it.
It was fitting that Tkachuk finished with a hat-trick, given how much the Oilers clearly hate him.
But Game 1 of the Battle of Alberta was everything hockey fans were hoping for, and, hopefully, we get six more wars before it's all said and done.

     Summary: File Photo by Bill Greenblatt/UPI | License PhotoMay 19 (UPI) -- Left wing Matthew Tkachuk scored three goals to help the Calgary Flames beat the Edmonton Oilers 9-6 in Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinal series.

Flames right wing Brett Ritchie pushed the lead to three goals with another score 6:05 into the first period.
Defenseman Evan Bouchard scored a minute later, but Tkachuk answered with a power-play goal 74 seconds after the Oilers' second score.
The Flames will host the Oilers in Game 2 at 10:30 p.m. EDT Friday in Calgary.

Final Edmonton Oilers 6 Calgary Flames 9If you watched this game you probably don’t want to relive this game because it was a terrible effort by the Edmonton Oilers.
The Edmonton Oilers in my opinion were lucky to even have a chance to win this game.
Jacob MarkstromI think the Edmonton Oilers missed a chance to win a game when Markstrom plays a bad game.
If the Edmonton Oilers would have converted on any of their 4 powerplays that actually could have won this game.

     Flames prospect update: Stockton advances and the T-Birds pull off a shocker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since the last time we checked in with the fresh-faced prospects of the Calgary Flames organization, two pretty impressive things happened.
First, the Stockton Heat got out the brooms and swept the Bakersfield Condors in the Calder Cup playoffs.
Connor Mackey, Adam Ruzicka and Adam Werner are with the Flames as extra depth players for the playoffs.
We’re expecting some, but likely not all, of the Flames’ prospects that were eliminated from the junior playoffs to join the Heat on amateur try-outs.
In that next round, they’re currently down 2-0 to the Charlottetown Islanders and have been out-scored 9-2 so far.
