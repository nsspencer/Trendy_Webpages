     Summary: The Southeastern Conference issued public reprimands to Jimbo Fisher and Nick Saban Thursday in light of recent comments from both coaches criticizing their respective programs.
The statement, obtained by The Athletic’s Nicole Auerbach, includes remarks from SEC commissioner Greg Sankey addressing the board’s disapproval of Fisher and Saban’s actions.
Public criticism of any kind does not resolve issues and creates a distraction from seeking solutions for the issues facing college athletics today."
“There is tremendous frustration concerning the absence of consistent rules from state to state related to name, image and likeness.
We need to work together to find solutions and that will be our focus at the upcoming SEC Spring Meetings.”More Saban/Fisher Coverage:• Forde: Jimbo Fisher and Nick Saban’s Jaw-Dropping Public Spat Is an SEC Shock Wave• Lane Kiffin Reacts to Fisher Blasting Saban• Fisher on Saban: ‘Maybe Somebody Should Have Slapped Him’• CFB Twitter Reacts to Fisher, Saban Drama

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In this case, the sausage is recruiting, which is greasy enough without attaching a breakfast analogy to it.
You can talk smack about a man's record, playcalling or coaching staff quality, but you better not go there with recruiting.
The NCAA concluded in 2019 that there was "an unconstrained culture of booster involvement in football recruiting."
One man's cheating is another man's recruiting.
What's different is NIL revealed a black market economy that is now more or less allowed and above board.

     Summary: Former Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders and Alabama football coach Nick Saban appear together in TV commercials where they play up Prime Time’s penchant for expensive bling.
Saban stirred up a hornet’s nest recently when he railed against what he sees as widespread misuse of the Name, Image, and Likeness deals that are becoming an increasingly larger part of college football.
(Aggies coach Jimbo Fisher went scorched-earth on Saban with comments made Thursday, retorting, “Some people think they’re God.
Go dig into how God did his deal.”)But Saban also named tiny Jackson State in his remarks.
“You best believe I will address that LIE Coach SABAN told tomorrow,” Sanders tweeted in the wee hours Thursday morning.

     Summary: Alabama coach Nick Saban and Texas A&amp;M coach Jimbo Fisher made the business of college football recruiting too personal.
Remember when the kickoff time for Alabama-Texas on Sept. 10 was the hottest debate in college football this week?
Every gripe by Saban induces moans and eye rolls, because he's running the greatest college football dynasty of all time.
Alabama has won six national championships and had the top recruiting class in college football eight times since 2012.
"We build him up to be the czar of football," Fisher said of Saban, who was his boss at LSU.
