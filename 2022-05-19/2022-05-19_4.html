     Summary: "I should’ve never really singled anyone out," Saban said during an appearance on Sirius XM College.
Fisher labeled Saban’s comments “despicable,” called him a “narcissist” and, in one of the most remarkable broadsides levied between two high-profile coaches, suggested that “somebody should have slapped” Saban as a child.
"There is tremendous frustration concerning the absence of consistent rules from state to state related to name, image and likeness.
Saban suggests it could, writes Chase GoodbreadSaban clarified in his radio appearance that he wasn't accusing A&amp;M or Fisher of violating any NCAA or state rules related to NIL.
"I really wasn’t saying that anyone was doing anything illegal in using name, image and likeness.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Southeastern Conference issued public reprimands to Jimbo Fisher and Nick Saban Thursday in light of recent comments from both coaches criticizing their respective programs.
The statement, obtained by The Athletic’s Nicole Auerbach, includes remarks from SEC commissioner Greg Sankey addressing the board’s disapproval of Fisher and Saban’s actions.
Public criticism of any kind does not resolve issues and creates a distraction from seeking solutions for the issues facing college athletics today."
“There is tremendous frustration concerning the absence of consistent rules from state to state related to name, image and likeness.
We need to work together to find solutions and that will be our focus at the upcoming SEC Spring Meetings.”More Saban/Fisher Coverage:• Forde: Jimbo Fisher and Nick Saban’s Jaw-Dropping Public Spat Is an SEC Shock Wave• Lane Kiffin Reacts to Fisher Blasting Saban• Fisher on Saban: ‘Maybe Somebody Should Have Slapped Him’• CFB Twitter Reacts to Fisher, Saban Drama

     Nick Saban a ‘Liar’: Falcons Legend Deion Sanders Rips Alabama Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Despicable.”College football is suddenly revealing its seedy underbelly..Alabama Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban has opted to address the new NIL trend by starting a game of feces-throwing.
"You best believe I will address that lie coach Saban told,'' said Sanders, who now coaches at Jackson State.
And Texas A&amp;M Aggies coach Jimbo Fisher's response to similar accusations?
1 Tide in College Station last season seemed particularly angry with his former pupil, Aggies coach Jimbo Fisher, and the way the Aggies conduct their business.
That’s what it’s become and that’s the problem in college athletics right now.”It is inarguably a problem.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In this case, the sausage is recruiting, which is greasy enough without attaching a breakfast analogy to it.
You can talk smack about a man's record, playcalling or coaching staff quality, but you better not go there with recruiting.
The NCAA concluded in 2019 that there was "an unconstrained culture of booster involvement in football recruiting."
One man's cheating is another man's recruiting.
What's different is NIL revealed a black market economy that is now more or less allowed and above board.
