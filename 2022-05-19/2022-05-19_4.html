     Nick Saban apologizes for comments levied at Jimbo Fisher and Texas A&amp;M football program

     Summary: "I should’ve never really singled anyone out," Saban said during an appearance on Sirius XM College.
Fisher labeled Saban’s comments “despicable,” called him a “narcissist” and, in one of the most remarkable broadsides levied between two high-profile coaches, suggested that “somebody should have slapped” Saban as a child.
"There is tremendous frustration concerning the absence of consistent rules from state to state related to name, image and likeness.
Saban suggests it could, writes Chase GoodbreadSaban clarified in his radio appearance that he wasn't accusing A&amp;M or Fisher of violating any NCAA or state rules related to NIL.
"I really wasn’t saying that anyone was doing anything illegal in using name, image and likeness.

     Nick Saban sounds scared in NIL rant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “You best believe I will address that LIE Coach SABAN told tomorrow,” Sanders said to the late-night Twitter crowd.
The topic set off Saban like we’ve never heard him rant before … or maybe any football coach ever.
Texas A&amp;M was using those third-party NIL collectives to pay players (allegedly) because Texas law allows for that to happen.
There is always an agenda, and that agenda is being able to recruit the best football players to the University of Alabama.
There are truth bombs, and then there are Saban rants and the two should never be confused for one another.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saban said he's not apologizing for speaking out and understands he's going to be criticized.
"A lot of people are silent on this, and some of it has been people lumping NIL in with using NIL to pay players to go to school," Saban said.
I don't," Saban said.
Saban thinks there are three categories of schools capitalizing right now on the lack of structure surrounding NIL.
"That way, nobody feels that one player is getting a bunch of money to come here and another player feels like he's not getting anything," Saban explained.

     Summary: Former Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders and Alabama football coach Nick Saban appear together in TV commercials where they play up Prime Time’s penchant for expensive bling.
Saban stirred up a hornet’s nest recently when he railed against what he sees as widespread misuse of the Name, Image, and Likeness deals that are becoming an increasingly larger part of college football.
(Aggies coach Jimbo Fisher went scorched-earth on Saban with comments made Thursday, retorting, “Some people think they’re God.
Go dig into how God did his deal.”)But Saban also named tiny Jackson State in his remarks.
“You best believe I will address that LIE Coach SABAN told tomorrow,” Sanders tweeted in the wee hours Thursday morning.

But I don't know if we're going to be able to sustain that in the future because more and more people are doing it."
Fisher, a former Saban assistant, fired back Thursday at the notion that NIL played a role in his program's recruiting success.
Unless we got something that protect them from litigation, I don't know what we're going to do about it."
I don't know how you manage a locker room -- and I don't know if this is a sustainable model.

     Summary: In a jaw-dropping span of less than 14 hours, Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban launched an attack on Aggies coach Jimbo Fisher, saying A&amp;M “bought every player on their team,” and Fisher responded with scorched-earth fury.
Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advertiser/USA TODAY NetworkI’ve been covering college football for 32 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this.
Make up your own mind on that one, but understand that the underground economy was humming for decades in college football before paying players went NCAA-legal last July 1.
“[Saban] is showing you who he is.”In an eye-popping flurry, Nick Saban and Jimbo Fisher showed everyone what the SEC is—a buck-wild, bare-knuckles conference that is becoming a caricature of itself.
