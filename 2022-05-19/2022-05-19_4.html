     Summary: Texas A&amp;M coach Jimbo Fisher said Thursday he ignored a phone call from Nick Saban after the Alabama coach made national headlines Wednesday night by saying the Aggies “bought every player” in their top-ranked 2022 recruiting class.

Last October, Fisher became the first of Saban’s former assistants to beat him when Texas A&amp;M upset then-top ranked Alabama in College Station.
After the win, Fisher said of Saban, “He’s been a great friend.
There’s a reason I ain’t went back and worked for him [Nick Saban], with opportunities.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Good on Fisher for exposing Saban as an ego-maniac who whines when he doesn’t get his way.
Saban has been put on a pedestal by the college football media.
For far too long, Saban has got away with being the self-appointed czar of college football.
He should be treated no differently than any other college football coach because ultimately that’s all he is — a football coach.
It’s time for the biggest narcissist in college football to go away.

     Former Cowboys CB Deion Sanders called out by Alabama's Nick Saban over NIL deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders and Alabama football coach Nick Saban appear together in TV commercials where they play up Prime Time’s penchant for expensive bling.
Saban stirred up a hornet’s nest recently when he railed against what he sees as widespread misuse of the Name, Image, and Likeness deals that are becoming an increasingly larger part of college football.
(Aggies coach Jimbo Fisher went scorched-earth on Saban with comments made Thursday, retorting, “Some people think they’re God.
Go dig into how God did his deal.”)But Saban also named tiny Jackson State in his remarks.
“You best believe I will address that LIE Coach SABAN told tomorrow,” Sanders tweeted in the wee hours Thursday morning.

     Summary: Speaking at a 50-day countdown event for the World Games, Saban touched on the ways name, image and likeness (NIL) has impacted the game.
But I don't know if we're going to be able to sustain that in the future because more and more people are doing it."
Fisher, a former Saban assistant, fired back Thursday at the notion that NIL played a role in his program's recruiting success.
Unless we got something that protect them from litigation, I don't know what we're going to do about it."
I don't know how you manage a locker room -- and I don't know if this is a sustainable model.

     Summary: In a jaw-dropping span of less than 14 hours, Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban launched an attack on Aggies coach Jimbo Fisher, saying A&amp;M “bought every player on their team,” and Fisher responded with scorched-earth fury.
Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advertiser/USA TODAY NetworkI’ve been covering college football for 32 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this.
Make up your own mind on that one, but understand that the underground economy was humming for decades in college football before paying players went NCAA-legal last July 1.
“[Saban] is showing you who he is.”In an eye-popping flurry, Nick Saban and Jimbo Fisher showed everyone what the SEC is—a buck-wild, bare-knuckles conference that is becoming a caricature of itself.
