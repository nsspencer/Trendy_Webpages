     Nick Saban comes out swinging: Texas oil money threatens Alabama, Georgia recruiting dominance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama coach Nick Saban officially called out Texas A&amp;M and took a swipe at Jackson State for paying student-athletes to come to their schools to play football.
Saban -- who claims the Tide didn’t pay any of its recruits -- was very much intentional in his remarks, which are sobering:“We were second in recruiting last year.
“Jackson State paid a guy a million dollars last year that was a really good Division I player to come to school.
I don’t think that would be the NCAA’s intention,” Saban said the day before the CFP Championship Game.
“You’re going to have the haves and have-nots and the separations that’s already there is going to grow larger,” Smart said.

Fisher labeled Saban’s comments “despicable,” called him a “narcissist” and, in one of the most remarkable broadsides levied between two high-profile coaches, suggested that “somebody should have slapped” Saban as a child.
"There is tremendous frustration concerning the absence of consistent rules from state to state related to name, image and likeness.
Saban suggests it could, writes Chase GoodbreadSaban clarified in his radio appearance that he wasn't accusing A&amp;M or Fisher of violating any NCAA or state rules related to NIL.
"I really wasn’t saying that anyone was doing anything illegal in using name, image and likeness.

     SEC Publicly Reprimands Jimbo Fisher, Nick Saban Following Public Feud
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Southeastern Conference issued public reprimands to Jimbo Fisher and Nick Saban Thursday in light of recent comments from both coaches criticizing their respective programs.
The statement, obtained by The Athletic’s Nicole Auerbach, includes remarks from SEC commissioner Greg Sankey addressing the board’s disapproval of Fisher and Saban’s actions.
Public criticism of any kind does not resolve issues and creates a distraction from seeking solutions for the issues facing college athletics today."
“There is tremendous frustration concerning the absence of consistent rules from state to state related to name, image and likeness.
We need to work together to find solutions and that will be our focus at the upcoming SEC Spring Meetings.”More Saban/Fisher Coverage:• Forde: Jimbo Fisher and Nick Saban’s Jaw-Dropping Public Spat Is an SEC Shock Wave• Lane Kiffin Reacts to Fisher Blasting Saban• Fisher on Saban: ‘Maybe Somebody Should Have Slapped Him’• CFB Twitter Reacts to Fisher, Saban Drama

     Summary: SEC commissioner Greg Sankey reprimanded both Texas A&amp;M coach Jimbo Fisher and Alabama coach Nick Saban after the two ignited a fiery feud this week.
“The membership of the Southeastern Conference has established expectations for conduct and sportsmanship that were not met last night nor today,” Sankey said.
“A hallmark of the SEC is intense competition within an environment of collaboration.
I apologize for that,” said Saban, who also explicitly referenced Deion Sanders’ Jackson State program and Miami basketball.
"Because I learned that when I was a kid, if you did, the old man slapped me upside the head.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In this case, the sausage is recruiting, which is greasy enough without attaching a breakfast analogy to it.
You can talk smack about a man's record, playcalling or coaching staff quality, but you better not go there with recruiting.
The NCAA concluded in 2019 that there was "an unconstrained culture of booster involvement in football recruiting."
One man's cheating is another man's recruiting.
What's different is NIL revealed a black market economy that is now more or less allowed and above board.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The verbal haymakers exchanged by Alabama's Nick Saban and Texas A&amp;M's Jimbo Fisher the past 24 hours can best be summed up as the most appropriate possible soundtrack for 2022.
His old assistant, Fisher, held nothing back in response, including suggesting that "somebody should have slapped" Saban.
As Finebaum himself noted during his SEC Network show on Thursday, Fisher used the word "despicable" 15 times in his rant.
Don't expect too many smiles the next time Jimbo Fisher and Nick Saban get together.
It will echo on through the fall and well beyond, until there's definitive rules and folks in charge competent enough to enforce them.
