     Nick Saban is an ego-maniac who is bad for college football and it’s about time someone called him out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Good on Fisher for exposing Saban as an ego-maniac who whines when he doesn’t get his way.
Saban has been put on a pedestal by the college football media.
For far too long, Saban has got away with being the self-appointed czar of college football.
He should be treated no differently than any other college football coach because ultimately that’s all he is — a football coach.
It’s time for the biggest narcissist in college football to go away.

    </h2>

     Summary: A&amp;M bought every player on their team.
“Jackson State paid a guy a million dollars last year that was a really good Division I player to come to school.
Saban also referenced Miami donor John Ruiz, a billionaire who has funded NIL deals for numerous Hurricanes athletes.
“Those guys from Miami that are going to play basketball there for $400,000, that’s in the newspaper,” Saban said.
The Aggies are a Southeastern Conference rival in the West Division and coached by former Saban assistant Jimbo Fisher.

     Jimbo Fisher went scorched earth with Nick Saban. Here are the 6 most damning things he said
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Jimbo Fisher declared his Texas A&amp;M football team would beat Alabama and Nick Saban's butts last summer, his remarks were viewed as bold.
Here are the most damning things Fisher said about Saban in the news conference in which the gloves flew off, words were not minced and attack after attack rocketed out of Fisher's mouth.
Fisher said it's despicable that Saban would say those things about Texas A&amp;M when he doesn't get his way.
Maybe someone should have slapped (Saban)."
"Listen, you coach with people like Bobby Bowden (at Florida State) and learn how to do things," Fisher said.

     Nick Saban sounds scared in NIL rant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “You best believe I will address that LIE Coach SABAN told tomorrow,” Sanders said to the late-night Twitter crowd.
The topic set off Saban like we’ve never heard him rant before … or maybe any football coach ever.
Texas A&amp;M was using those third-party NIL collectives to pay players (allegedly) because Texas law allows for that to happen.
There is always an agenda, and that agenda is being able to recruit the best football players to the University of Alabama.
There are truth bombs, and then there are Saban rants and the two should never be confused for one another.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Speaking at a 50-day countdown event for the World Games, Saban touched on the ways name, image and likeness (NIL) has impacted the game.
But I don't know if we're going to be able to sustain that in the future because more and more people are doing it."
Fisher, a former Saban assistant, fired back Thursday at the notion that NIL played a role in his program's recruiting success.
Unless we got something that protect them from litigation, I don't know what we're going to do about it."
I don't know how you manage a locker room -- and I don't know if this is a sustainable model.

     Summary: In a jaw-dropping span of less than 14 hours, Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban launched an attack on Aggies coach Jimbo Fisher, saying A&amp;M “bought every player on their team,” and Fisher responded with scorched-earth fury.
Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advertiser/USA TODAY NetworkI’ve been covering college football for 32 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this.
Make up your own mind on that one, but understand that the underground economy was humming for decades in college football before paying players went NCAA-legal last July 1.
“[Saban] is showing you who he is.”In an eye-popping flurry, Nick Saban and Jimbo Fisher showed everyone what the SEC is—a buck-wild, bare-knuckles conference that is becoming a caricature of itself.
