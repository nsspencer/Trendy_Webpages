     Nick Saban, Jimbo Fisher reprimanded by SEC commissioner Greg Sankey for public criticism of another school
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Late Thursday afternoon, SEC commissioner Greg Sankey publicly reprimanded the two coaches for their violation of SEC bylaws related to "Ethical Conduct for derogatory comments and public criticism" of another institution's athletics program and staff.
Public criticism of any kind does not resolve issues and creates a distraction from seeking solutions for the issues facing college athletics today.
We need to work together to find solutions and that will be our focus at the upcoming SEC Spring Meetings."
Bjork said he has already had discussions with Sankey over the matter, but Fisher doesn't think a public reprimand will do all that much.
This isn't the first time that the commissioner of the SEC has had to step in while high-profile coaches sparred through the media.

     Summary: “You best believe I will address that LIE Coach SABAN told tomorrow,” Sanders said to the late-night Twitter crowd.
The topic set off Saban like we’ve never heard him rant before … or maybe any football coach ever.
Texas A&amp;M was using those third-party NIL collectives to pay players (allegedly) because Texas law allows for that to happen.
There is always an agenda, and that agenda is being able to recruit the best football players to the University of Alabama.
There are truth bombs, and then there are Saban rants and the two should never be confused for one another.

     Summary: It has helped us all better understand which college football coaches hate each other.
AdvertisementThursday morning, Texas A&amp;M Coach Jimbo Fisher sprinted to the nearest news conference and pulled out a grenade launcher.
Having outperformed even its typically high recruiting rankings, Texas A&amp;M immediately took fire for how it used NIL.
The parity in college football he’s been talking about, go to talk to coaches who coach for him.
NIL rules have moved it somewhat above board now, though, and so coaches feel emboldened to criticize their brethren in public.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saban said he's not apologizing for speaking out and understands he's going to be criticized.
"A lot of people are silent on this, and some of it has been people lumping NIL in with using NIL to pay players to go to school," Saban said.
I don't," Saban said.
Saban thinks there are three categories of schools capitalizing right now on the lack of structure surrounding NIL.
"That way, nobody feels that one player is getting a bunch of money to come here and another player feels like he's not getting anything," Saban explained.

     Summary: Former Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders and Alabama football coach Nick Saban appear together in TV commercials where they play up Prime Time’s penchant for expensive bling.
Saban stirred up a hornet’s nest recently when he railed against what he sees as widespread misuse of the Name, Image, and Likeness deals that are becoming an increasingly larger part of college football.
(Aggies coach Jimbo Fisher went scorched-earth on Saban with comments made Thursday, retorting, “Some people think they’re God.
Go dig into how God did his deal.”)But Saban also named tiny Jackson State in his remarks.
“You best believe I will address that LIE Coach SABAN told tomorrow,” Sanders tweeted in the wee hours Thursday morning.

Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advertiser/USA TODAY NetworkI’ve been covering college football for 32 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this.
Make up your own mind on that one, but understand that the underground economy was humming for decades in college football before paying players went NCAA-legal last July 1.
“[Saban] is showing you who he is.”In an eye-popping flurry, Nick Saban and Jimbo Fisher showed everyone what the SEC is—a buck-wild, bare-knuckles conference that is becoming a caricature of itself.
