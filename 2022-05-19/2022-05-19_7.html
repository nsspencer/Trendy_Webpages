     Vangelis, the Greek ‘Chariots of Fire’ composer, dies at 79
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Vangelis, the Greek electronic composer who wrote the unforgettable Academy Award-winning score for the film “Chariots of Fire” and music for dozens of other movies, documentaries and TV series, has died at 79.
Greek media reported that Vangelis — born Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou — died in a French hospital late Tuesday.
The 1981 British film made Vangelis, but his initial encounter with success came with his first Greek pop band in the 1960s.
He was fascinated by space exploration and wrote music for celestial bodies, but said he never sought stardom himself.
Vangelis later wrote music scores for Ridley Scott’s “Blade Runner” (1982) and “1492: Conquest of Paradise” (1992), as well as for “Missing” (1982) and “Antarctica” (1983), among others.

     Vangelis, composer of Chariots of Fire and Blade Runner soundtracks, dies aged 79
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vangelis, the Greek composer and musician whose synth-driven work brought huge drama to film soundtracks including Blade Runner and Chariots of Fire, has died aged 79.
Born Evángelos Odysséas Papathanassíou in 1943, Vangelis won an Oscar for his 1981 Chariots of Fire soundtrack.
Mostly self-taught in music, Vangelis grew up in Athens and formed his first band in 1963, called the Forminx, playing the pop music of the time: uptempo rock’n’roll, sweeping ballads and Beatles cover versions, with Vangelis supplying organ lines.
“It has turned out to be a very prophetic film – we’re living in a kind of Blade Runner world now,” he said in 2005.
Among those paying tribute to Vangelis was Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who hailed “a pioneer of electronic sound”.

     Vangelis Dies: ‘Chariots Of Fire’, ‘Blade Runner’ Composer Was 79
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the mid-’70s, Vangelis relocated to London, launching a recording studio and landing a recording deal with RCA Records.
Some of Vangelis’ work from the era was used in Carl Sagan’s 1980 TV series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, providing an even larger audience for the composer’s work.
Vangelis followed up that success with a memorable collaboration with Ridley Scott for 1982’s Blade Runner, nominated for both BAFTA and Golden Globe awards.
Subsequent Vangelis film and TV scores include Roman Polanski’s Bitter Moon (1992) and Oliver Stone’s Alexander (2004).
In addition to his film work, Vangelis recorded numerous albums, both solo and in collaborations with other artists.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Its theme remains one of the most recognizable — and parodied — in film music history.
“Vangelis is the master of the sweeping, melodic statement,” Paul Haslinger, onetime member of Tangerine Dream, told NPR in 2016.
Outside of film, Vangelis wrote two scores for the London Royal Ballet in the mid-1980s, and he continued making solo albums through the 1990s and 2000s.
Advertisement“For me, music is science more than art,” Vangelis told NPR.
His father was “in property,” he told the Los Angeles Times, and was “a great lover of music.” Vangelis began playing the piano at 4 but received little formal training.
