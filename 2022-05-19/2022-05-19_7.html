     Edmonton Oilers Vs Calgary Flames- Game 1 Morning After

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Edmonton Oilers got crushed by the Calgary Flames last night down in Calgary.
Final Edmonton Oilers 6 Calgary Flames 9If you watched this game you probably don’t want to relive this game because it was a terrible effort by the Edmonton Oilers.
The Edmonton Oilers in my opinion were lucky to even have a chance to win this game.
Jacob MarkstromI think the Edmonton Oilers missed a chance to win a game when Markstrom plays a bad game.
If the Edmonton Oilers would have converted on any of their 4 powerplays that actually could have won this game.

     The Calgary Flames Aren't Messing Around Here
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But despite blowing a lead, the Calgary Flames showed they're a tough cookie to crack, and if their stars keep moving, stopping them will be a challenge.
Sergei Belski-USA TODAY SportsIn the 2021-22 regular season, the Calgary Flames had the NHL’s sixth-best offense (averaging 3.55 goals-for-per-game) and the third-best defense (averaging 2.51 goals-against per game).
The rest of the season, the Flames scored at least five goals in 21 of their wins.
And then, once the post-season began, they underscored their defensive prowess in a seven-game series win over the Dallas Stars.
As it stands, Calgary has the better goalie in Markstrom – and they’ve got the offense to back him up when he has an off night.

     Summary: In doing so, Lindholm and Mangiapane combined to break the record for the fastest two goals ever scored to start off a playoff game.
His quick pair also made Calgary just the fourth club in NHL history to score three opening-minute goals in any playoff game.
All told, the winger’s got four to his name through eight playoff games as an Oiler.
The unforgettable series opener was the first 15-goal playoff game the NHL has seen in nearly three decades.
A 9-6 win by the Los Angeles Kings over none other than the Calgary Flames back in Game 6 of the ’93 Division Semifinals.
