     Melvin Capital to shut after heavy losses on meme stocks, market slump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Melvin Capital, once one of Wall Street's most successful hedge funds which then lost billions in the meme stock saga, will shut down after it was hit again by this year's market slump.
Gabe Plotkin, widely regarded as one of the industry's best traders after posting years of double digit returns, told investors that the last 17 months have been "an incredibly trying time."
"The appropriate next step is to wind down the Funds by fully liquidating the Funds' assets and accounts and returning cash to all investors," Plotkin wrote in a letter reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday.
Melvin Capital had $7.8 billion in assets at the end of April.
The fund lost 23% in the first four months of 2022, a person familiar with the fund's finances said.

"I now recognize that I need to step away from managing external capital," Plotkin wrote to investors.
AdvertisementGabe Plotkin's Melvin Capital hedge fund plans to return money to its investors and shut down later this year, Bloomberg first reported on Wednesday.
If a hedge fund loses 10% for its investors in a given year, the investor wouldn't pay performance fees until the hedge fund returns to breakeven.
With Melvin Capital shutting down, it needs to sell all of its holdings if it hasn't already (though it probably has).

     Plotkin Shuts Melvin Hedge Fund Reeling From Redditor Attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Bloomberg) -- More than a year after Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital Management was grievously injured in a short squeeze by amateur traders who organized on Reddit, the $7.8 billion hedge fund is giving up and shutting down.
Plotkin, who’d made the mistake of betting against shares in a way that was publicly disclosed, lost billions in the so-called short squeeze, leading his hedge fund to post a 55% loss that month.
Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Ken Griffin’s Citadel funds, as well as partners of his Chicago-based firm, provided a $2.75 billion infusion to Melvin.
Plotkin’s hedge fund tumbled more than 23% through April this year.
Plotkin joined Cohen’s firm, then called SAC in 2006, where he invested in mostly consumer stocks, ultimately running more than $1 billion.
