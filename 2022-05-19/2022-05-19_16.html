     Summary: The Edmonton Oilers got crushed by the Calgary Flames last night down in Calgary.
Final Edmonton Oilers 6 Calgary Flames 9If you watched this game you probably don’t want to relive this game because it was a terrible effort by the Edmonton Oilers.
The Edmonton Oilers in my opinion were lucky to even have a chance to win this game.
Jacob MarkstromI think the Edmonton Oilers missed a chance to win a game when Markstrom plays a bad game.
If the Edmonton Oilers would have converted on any of their 4 powerplays that actually could have won this game.

     The Calgary Flames Aren't Messing Around Here
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But despite blowing a lead, the Calgary Flames showed they're a tough cookie to crack, and if their stars keep moving, stopping them will be a challenge.
Sergei Belski-USA TODAY SportsIn the 2021-22 regular season, the Calgary Flames had the NHL’s sixth-best offense (averaging 3.55 goals-for-per-game) and the third-best defense (averaging 2.51 goals-against per game).
The rest of the season, the Flames scored at least five goals in 21 of their wins.
And then, once the post-season began, they underscored their defensive prowess in a seven-game series win over the Dallas Stars.
As it stands, Calgary has the better goalie in Markstrom – and they’ve got the offense to back him up when he has an off night.

     Five takeaways from the Calgary Flames’ Game 1 win over the Edmonton Oilers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowA game of mistakesThe Flames were good at possessing the puck, but after the game Flames blueliner Rasmus Andersson remarked that all six Edmonton goals can be tied to Flames miscues.
Here are Edmonton’s six goals:1: The two teams battle for the puck below the Flames goal line.
2: The Flames turn over the puck inside the Oilers blueline and the Oilers rush back the other way.
3: The Flames turn over the puck inside the Oilers blueline and the Oilers rush back the other way.
(You could argue that the first Hyman goal was on the goaltender, but the other five were team breakdowns.)

     Summary: In doing so, Lindholm and Mangiapane combined to break the record for the fastest two goals ever scored to start off a playoff game.
His quick pair also made Calgary just the fourth club in NHL history to score three opening-minute goals in any playoff game.
All told, the winger’s got four to his name through eight playoff games as an Oiler.
The unforgettable series opener was the first 15-goal playoff game the NHL has seen in nearly three decades.
A 9-6 win by the Los Angeles Kings over none other than the Calgary Flames back in Game 6 of the ’93 Division Semifinals.
