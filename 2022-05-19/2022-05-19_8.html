     NHL Playoffs 2022: Flames set record with fastest two goals to begin playoff game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Flames were able to record the fastest two goals ever to open a playoff game when they lit the lamp twice in the opening 51 seconds of the first period for an early advantage.
In addition, the two opening goals were just 25 seconds apart, which is the sixth-fastest time that two playoff goals were scored in Flames history.
That record is 14 seconds, which was set by Backlund and Matthew Tkachuk in Game 1 of the First Round back in 2019.
Only two teams in NHL history have registered two goals to start any playoff period in fewer than 51 seconds.
Tkachuk became the first Flames player since Theo Fleury in 1995 to record a playoff hat trick.

     Summary: The Edmonton Oilers got crushed by the Calgary Flames last night down in Calgary.
Final Edmonton Oilers 6 Calgary Flames 9If you watched this game you probably don’t want to relive this game because it was a terrible effort by the Edmonton Oilers.
The Edmonton Oilers in my opinion were lucky to even have a chance to win this game.
Jacob MarkstromI think the Edmonton Oilers missed a chance to win a game when Markstrom plays a bad game.
If the Edmonton Oilers would have converted on any of their 4 powerplays that actually could have won this game.

     The Calgary Flames Aren't Messing Around Here
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But despite blowing a lead, the Calgary Flames showed they're a tough cookie to crack, and if their stars keep moving, stopping them will be a challenge.
Sergei Belski-USA TODAY SportsIn the 2021-22 regular season, the Calgary Flames had the NHL’s sixth-best offense (averaging 3.55 goals-for-per-game) and the third-best defense (averaging 2.51 goals-against per game).
The rest of the season, the Flames scored at least five goals in 21 of their wins.
And then, once the post-season began, they underscored their defensive prowess in a seven-game series win over the Dallas Stars.
As it stands, Calgary has the better goalie in Markstrom – and they’ve got the offense to back him up when he has an off night.

    </h2>

     Summary: Flames' goal is to survive the McDavid minutes The Flames have depth, but the Oilers have star power.
The Connor McDavid line was as lethal as usual.
That brings us to the McDavid line.
Calgary’s path to victory means slowing the McDavid line down, as much as practically possible.
If that regresses even marginally, it’s going to mean more offensive-zone pressure from the McDavid line.
