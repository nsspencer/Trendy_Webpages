     Everton guaranteed Premier League survival as fans storm field to celebrate comeback win over Crystal Palace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Goodison Park delivered one of the biggest moments of the Premier League season on Thursday when Everton fans stormed the field to celebrate an come-from-behind 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace to guarantee three points Premier League safety ahead of the final matchday of the season.
Only needing a victory to escape the relegation zone, Dominic Calvert-Lewin capped a second half that saw the Toffees rattle off three unanswered goals to storm back into Premier League survival in improbable fashion.
You could see how much that goal meant to the Everton fans as they stormed the field in the 85th minute -- before the game even ended -- to celebrate the go-ahead goal.
It would have been a massive disappointment to see a club as proud as Everton to fall out of the Premier League for the first time in 68 years.
And he didn't only talk the talk, but also made an important tactical change to start the second half.
