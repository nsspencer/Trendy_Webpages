     Summary: The Edmonton Oilers got crushed by the Calgary Flames last night down in Calgary.
Final Edmonton Oilers 6 Calgary Flames 9If you watched this game you probably don’t want to relive this game because it was a terrible effort by the Edmonton Oilers.
The Edmonton Oilers in my opinion were lucky to even have a chance to win this game.
Jacob MarkstromI think the Edmonton Oilers missed a chance to win a game when Markstrom plays a bad game.
If the Edmonton Oilers would have converted on any of their 4 powerplays that actually could have won this game.

     Summary: In doing so, Lindholm and Mangiapane combined to break the record for the fastest two goals ever scored to start off a playoff game.
His quick pair also made Calgary just the fourth club in NHL history to score three opening-minute goals in any playoff game.
All told, the winger’s got four to his name through eight playoff games as an Oiler.
The unforgettable series opener was the first 15-goal playoff game the NHL has seen in nearly three decades.
A 9-6 win by the Los Angeles Kings over none other than the Calgary Flames back in Game 6 of the ’93 Division Semifinals.
