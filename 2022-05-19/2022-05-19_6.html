     MultiVersus is a shameless mashup of Space Jam and Smash Bros. — and it works
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Let’s just get this out of the way: there’s very little that’s original about MultiVersus, an upcoming free-to-play fighting game.
Bros., only with Warner Bros. characters in place of those from Nintendo and other classic video games.
From what I’ve played, MultiVersus has the core gameplay down, at least well enough for an amateur like me.
In the alpha, there were 15 characters available, which feels small when you’re used to the more than 80 in Smash Bros.
The important part won’t just be rolling out new fighters regularly but also making those rollouts feel like an exciting event, which is something Smash Bros. mastermind Masahiro Sakurai has perfected.

     MultiVersus is a shockingly good fighting game with tanks, supports, and counters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MultiVersus, which is a clever and haunting title for a mash-up free-to-play fighting game, recognizes this.
Wonder Woman, who I played the most, is a tank that thrives off of shielding damage and knocking enemies back.
MultiVersus is interested in the intricate dance of an expertly made fighting game made for people who aren't already obsessed with fighting games.
MultiVersus isn't a mindblowing idea for a game—on its face, it's very similar to the recent and kind of terrible Nickelodeon fighting game from last year.
MultiVersus deploys its unmistakable characters as a trojan horse for a game that's actually more interested in the intricate dance of an expertly made fighting game made for people who aren't already obsessed with fighting games.

     ‘Ultra Instinct’ Shaggy was an early, obvious pick for WB’s MultiVersus, creators say

     Summary: But Shaggy, specifically the heavily memed “Ultra Instinct” version of the Scooby-Doo slacker, was an obvious and early choice for MultiVersus, its creators say.
It was very community driven — to see Shaggy in a fighting game.”White noted the origins of Ultra Instinct Shaggy, which derived from the 2011 animated movie Scooby-Doo!
More than 380,000 Change.org petitioners later lobbied Warner Bros. and Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm Studios to put Ultra Instinct Shaggy in Mortal Kombat 11.
“What does the game need in its next character?
But we definitely look at what’s the community looking for.

     Summary: Shaggy in MultiVersus Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentMultiVersus is a new platform fighter from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Player First Games.
This is Warner Bros’ spin on the likes of Super Smash Bros.
I think there’s going to be a bit of a learning curve as players learn each of the characters’ moves and how they can combine.
Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentI am not, by any stretch of the imagination, a fighting game expert.
Harley Quinn in MultiVersus Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentThere’s a deep, deep well of IP for the developers to pull from to build out the roster.

     MultiVersus Preview: Engaging, Complex, Surprisingly Delightful
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Instead, in less than a week, MultiVersus has made me want to get more into fighting games.
MultiVersus gameplay: Familiar, but freshThe core gameplay of MultiVersus will feel familiar to anyone who's played Super Smash Bros. before.
But matches of MultiVersus feel distinct from other platform fighters.
It adds layers to the longtime fighting game strategy of "What is my matchup against this character and how do I need to play as a result?"
"We believe that brings a whole new element to the fighting game genre of learning your ally, learning how to use synergistic moves with your allies," which adds an additional layer of strategy to fighting game mechanics.

     Multiversus (for PC) Preview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Multiversus takes those beloved characters—from brands like DC Comics, Game of Thrones, and Looney Toons—and throws them into a chaotic, free PC game.
Like the modern Mortal Kombat games, Multiversus' characters adjust their lines to directly call out specific opponents, like Velma calling Shaggy by his government name, "Norville."
I also played on my Xbox Series S. Like any competitive fighting game, Multiversus needs a locked frame rate to be playable.
Multiversus of MadnessIf all you want to see is a powered-up Shaggy throwing a sandwich at Batman, then Multiversus is already a success.
