When it came to transforming into the billboard queen, Rossum told E!
Her physical transformation was certainly a team effort, as Rossum told E!

     'Angelyne' review: Emmy Rossum stars in Peacock's two-dimensional look at the 'billboard queen'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) "Angelyne" approximates its subject in the wrong ways: It's big, attention-getting and has all the depth of a billboard.
Emmy Rossum stars and produced this limited series, which doesn't profess to be truth but rather a facsimile of it.
In a year that's already given the world the superior "Pam &amp; Tommy," consider this evidence that impressive makeup alone isn't enough.
The main problem is that the opening episodes do little to inspire the patience to stick around to find out.
Rossum speaks in a honeyed voice as she disappears into the role, mastering an attention-commanding strut even before the character acquires her oversized cleavage.

     ‘Angelyne’ Star Emmy Rossum on Advice She Received from the Real-Life Billboard Queen

     Summary: There was also a sit-down meeting with the woman herself, who had some early involvement in the series but was out by the time production began.
“She understood the power of her image and the fierce control and preservation that that living, breathing performance art needs to survive.
“It’s so weird because I had a meeting with Emmy before we started shooting, and that was the last time I saw Emmy until we wrapped,” he said.
“She kept up that attitude even off camera and it was sort of intimidating, as my character and as myself, to interact with her.
She has this presence as Angelyne the billboard queen.”Angelyne is now streaming on Peacock.

     Summary: "She's the original influencer," says Emmy Rossum, who portrays her in the Peacock original series Angelyne (May 19).
They would say, "Well, that's Angelyne."
So this is a really, really long time coming and a dream of mine since I was 13.
Well, only Angelyne can know why she really became Angelyne, but I think we offer a lot of possibilities.
Directing is completely all encompassing, so it would have to be something that I really, really responded to and loved.
