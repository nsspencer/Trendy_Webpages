     Rihanna Gives Birth to a Baby Boy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rihanna and A$AP Rocky are officially parents!
TMZ reports that the couple have welcomed their baby boy into the world.
While baby Ri's name isn't known to the public yet, TMZ shared that he was born on May 13 in Los Angeles.
Knowing Rihanna, she's probably planning something special — and stylish — to reveal her son's name in the near future.
Rihanna and A$AP Rocky first announced that they were expecting back in January 2022, when the singer-songwriter's pregnant belly was documented by celebrity photographer Miles Diggs.

     Rihanna Gives Birth to Baby Boy, First Child with A$AP Rocky
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rihanna and A$AP Rocky are officially parents ... welcoming a baby boy to the world.
The last time we saw Rihanna was on May 9 in Los Angeles for Mother's Day weekend when she and Rocky grabbed dinner at Giorgio Baldi.
While Rihanna looked stunning throughout her pregnancy ... wearing designer looks and proudly showing off her baby bump, there was also some drama that went down.
As we reported, A$AP was arrested just last month in a surprise bust as the couple's private plane touched down at LAX.
Nonetheless, Rihanna continued to support A$AP, even attending one of his shows, cheering for him backstage just a week after the arrest.
