     Summary: Harry Styles has taken over Rockefeller Plaza!
In honor of his third studio album, "Harry's House" which will be released tomorrow, the "Watermelon Sugar" singer headed to the plaza stage for Citi Concert Series on TODAY on Thursday.
The call-out for Styles’ performance broke records at TODAY, with approximately 50,000 people requested Fan Passes to see him perform.

He told TODAY that “Harry’s House” is his “most diverse” album to date since it was influenced by different people in his life.

     5 Takeaways from Harry Styles’ New Album, Harry’s House
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In March, Styles announced his forthcoming third album, Harry’s House.
Harry’s House favors a poppier sound with plenty of synthy ’80s moments and some indie pop touches.
After some self-reflection, he “realized that that home feeling isn’t something that you get from a house; it’s more of an internal thing.” That said, much of the action on Harry’s House revolves around physical spaces.
Guess who’s staying at Harry’s HouseHarry’s House reunites Styles with Kid Harpoon and Tyler Johnson, his main production team since his 2017 debut.
That’s a voice memo from Styles’ goddaughter Ruby Winston, the child of Ben Winston, an executive producer on Styles’ buddy James Corden’s The Late Late Show.

     Fans Camp Out Overnight to See Harry Styles Perform in the Rain on ‘Today’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harry Styles drew a horde of fans to Rockefeller Plaza on a gray, drizzly Thursday morning, May 19, for a special performance and interview on Today.
To that end, Styles called the LP his “most diverse” sounding, as it draws on many of his biggest influences.
As for his performances, Styles played the lead single form Harry’s House, “As It Was,” as well as “Watermelon Sugar,” the big hit from 2019’s Fine Line.
He also performed “Boyfriends,” another Harry’s House track that hasn’t been officially released yet, though he did perform it at Coachella.
Of the latter track, Styles said, “’Boyfriends,’ I wrote kind of towards the end of the recording of the last album.

     Harry Styles, Our Most Likable Pop Star, Keeps Evolving on ‘Harry’s House’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a celebrity, Harry Styles has a clearly defined and universally recognizable identity.
But now, with the release of his third album, Harry’s House, on Friday, Styles finally seems eager to establish who he is as a musician.
If that’s true, then we are pleased to report that Harry Styles, the musician, is just as refreshing and palatable as Harry Styles, the celebrity.
Harry’s House sounds markedly different from Styles’ previous works, trading pop-rock for head-bobbing ’70s-style funk and airy synth riffs.
Going into Harry’s House, Styles appeared conscious of the critique that his music has occasionally suffered from being too referential.
