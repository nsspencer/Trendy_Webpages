     Tiger Woods: My Leg Feels OK, as Long as I Don’t Play Golf
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TULSA, Okla. — Tiger Woods has a good sense of humor, though it is rare for him to use it in a public setting.
What was once unthinkable for him — playfully mocking his poor play on the golf course — is one of his new, winsome tools.
On Thursday, six weeks after his stirring comeback at the Masters Tournament, Woods returned to competitive golf in the first round of the P.G.A.
A couple of holes later, Woods was limping a lot, even sometimes using a golf club like a cane to ascend or descend hills.
Woods added that he could not put weight on his right leg in his backswing — known as loading — and he also struggled to push off his leg on the downswing, too.

     Tiger Woods struggles at PGA Championship: ‘Walking hurts and twisting hurts … It’s just golf’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —On the ninth hole of the first round, Tiger Woods slammed his golf club into the ground in frustration.
“My leg is not feeling as good as I would like it to be,” Woods told the media afterwards.
The PGA Championship marks Woods' second major tournament since his injury after he made a surprise appearance at The Masters last month.
Loading hurts, pressing off it hurts, walking hurts and twisting hurts.
While McIlroy averaged 331 yards off the tee, Woods averaged just 293.4 yards – the 136th shortest distance in a field of 156.

     Tiger Woods Hobbles to 74 in Opening Round at PGA Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Woods made five bogeys in his final nine holes of the first round and he'll have to battle to make the 36-hole cut on Friday.
Tiger Woods shot a 4-over 74 in Round 1 at the PGA Championship.
Playing alongside top-10 players Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, Woods acknowledged that he was in pain afterward.
While he hit 10 if 14 fairways, Woods hit just 7 of 18 greens and got up and down just 4 of 11 times.
From there, he flew the green, hit a flop shot that came up short, and needed to make a 4-footer for bogey.

     Summary: (0:23)TULSA, Okla. -- Rory McIlroy won't have to worry about back-dooring a top-5 finish at a major championship after he grabbed the first-round lead at the 104th PGA Championship at Southern Hills Country Club on Friday.
It's the first time McIlroy has led after the first round of a major since his last victory in one, the 2014 PGA Championship at Valhalla.
He made 150 feet of putts, his most in any PGA Tour round, and made four putts longer than 20 feet.
There have been two familiar sights at the PGA Championship over the past few years: John Daly riding in a cart drinking Diet Cokes and Brooks Koepka's name somewhere in the top five on the leaderboard.
Stream on ESPN+Koepka, who won the event in 2018 and 2019, was in the top five at the end of 14 of the past 16 rounds at the PGA Championship.

     2022 PGA Championship scores, takeaways: Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas impress with strong bookend efforts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TULSA, Okla. -- Rory McIlroy shot the round of the day with his 65 to open the 2022 PGA Championship, but Justin Thomas followed him with an effort that was nearly as impressive.
Somewhat incredibly, both Phil Mickelson (51, not attending this PGA) and Tiger Woods (46, barely barely walking around Southern Hills) have won majors more recently than Thomas and McIlroy.
This is the first time he's led or co-led a major round since 2014 (coincidentally, the last time he won, which was also the PGA).
And although Zalatoris has the confidence and the game to do so, it would still be mildly surprising if he held off McIlroy, Thomas and others for the first win of his career.
