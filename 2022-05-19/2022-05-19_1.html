     Tiger Woods Struggles at the P.G.A. Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tiger Woods returned to a major championship on Thursday, and after a good start, things started to go awry.
Playing in a star-studded group with Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy, Woods finished at four over par at the P.G.A.
Championship.
Championship, Woods at first showed few obvious signs of the severe leg injuries he sustained in a car crash in February 2021.
Toward the end of his first nine holes, he appeared to start limping a little more.

     Summary: 1:53 p.m.: It's not a birdie-birdie-birdie finish yet, but Spieth is on the right track.

Woods finds the greenside bunker and gets up and down for par, keeping him at two over.
McIlroy makes par and stays at five under, which is now only one shot clear of Tom Hoge, who birdies the 15th to climb to four under.
Up ahead at the long par-3 eighth, Will Zalatoris pulls off a wild up-and-down par save from well over the green to keep it at three under.

     Rory McIlroy sets early pace at 2022 PGA Championship with blistering opening round as Tiger Woods struggles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Rory McIlroy ended April's Masters with a bang, and he maintained his blistering form at the 2022 PGA Championship on Thursday.
In an up-and-down 18 holes at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a run of four consecutive birdies for McIlroy on his opening nine holes helped propel him to the top of the leaderboard.
But after showing why he's a four-time major winner, the 33-year-old had his struggles on the back-nine, two bogeys on his 15th and 17th holes dragged him back to the pack and tied at the top of the leaderboard with Will Zalatoris and Tom Hoge.
McIlroy reacts to a putt on the 17th green during the first round of the 2022 PGA Championship.
However, like at the Masters, McIlroy's round ended in a flourish.

     Tiger Woods Hobbles to 74 in Opening Round at PGA Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Woods made five bogeys in his final nine holes of the first round and he'll have to battle to make the 36-hole cut on Friday.
Tiger Woods shot a 4-over 74 in Round 1 at the PGA Championship.
Playing alongside top-10 players Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, Woods acknowledged that he was in pain afterward.
While he hit 10 if 14 fairways, Woods hit just 7 of 18 greens and got up and down just 4 of 11 times.
From there, he flew the green, hit a flop shot that came up short, and needed to make a 4-footer for bogey.
