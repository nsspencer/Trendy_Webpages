     PGA Championship 2022 live updates: Rory McIlroy leads, Tiger Woods off to solid start at Southern Hills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 12:42 p.m.: Tiger makes a much-needed bounce back birdie at No.
With the wind already picking up and possibly whipping even harder this afternoon, even par could look like a pretty good score by day's end.
No doubt that's the number on Woods' mind now with six holes remaining in his first round.
Speaking of bounce backs, Will Zalatoris has also bounced back after that short miss at the 18th.
McIlroy is still your leader at five under, and no one else has even reached four under yet.
