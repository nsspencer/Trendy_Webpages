    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you can’t watch Tiger Woods and his star-studded group on Thursday morning at the 2022 PGA Championship, don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.
The 15-time major champion is back at the home of his 2007 PGA win at Southern Hill Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and is playing alongside fellow stars Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth.
The last time we saw Woods was when he miraculously made the cut at the Masters in his return to competitive golf following a single-car accident that nearly cost him his leg.
Take a scroll through Woods opening round with shot-by-shot updates from Thursday at Southern Hills.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 10:16 a.m.: Turns out, Spieth and Rory were fine in that front bunker, but it was Woods who wound up with the toughest shot of all after air-mailing the green from 88 yards into the back bunker.
From an awkward lie, though, Tiger cozied one up to three feet to save par and remain at one under.
Spieth missed his birdie effort from 10 feet and Rory converted his birdie after a nice bunker shot to get to two under.
He's one behind Max Homa and Will Zalatoris.
And can you imagine Golf Twitter if all of its favorite sons keep this up?
