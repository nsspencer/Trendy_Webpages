     Tiger Woods: My Leg Feels OK, as Long as I Don’t Play Golf
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TULSA, Okla. — Tiger Woods has a good sense of humor, though it is rare for him to use it in a public setting.
What was once unthinkable for him — playfully mocking his poor play on the golf course — is one of his new, winsome tools.
On Thursday, six weeks after his stirring comeback at the Masters Tournament, Woods returned to competitive golf in the first round of the P.G.A.
A couple of holes later, Woods was limping a lot, even sometimes using a golf club like a cane to ascend or descend hills.
Woods added that he could not put weight on his right leg in his backswing — known as loading — and he also struggled to push off his leg on the downswing, too.

He may not draw the fans of the Tiger/Rory/Spieth pairing, but that doesn’t mean that the 39-year-old from Scottsdale, Ariz., can’t make some noise of his own.

     Summary: Shaggy John Daly produced yet another wild ride around a PGA Championship.
At the 2021 PGA Championship on Kiawah Island, Daly needed fans to help him get out of some sand when he got stuck.
Daly was disqualified from the PGA Tour Champions Regions Tradition last week after failing to do that after the second round.
The PGA championship is his fifth career tour event and second major.
“On top of that, it’s the toughest green on the golf course,” he said of the 18th.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Woods made five bogeys in his final nine holes of the first round and he'll have to battle to make the 36-hole cut on Friday.
Tiger Woods shot a 4-over 74 in Round 1 at the PGA Championship.
Playing alongside top-10 players Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, Woods acknowledged that he was in pain afterward.
While he hit 10 if 14 fairways, Woods hit just 7 of 18 greens and got up and down just 4 of 11 times.
From there, he flew the green, hit a flop shot that came up short, and needed to make a 4-footer for bogey.

A year ago, then-50-year-old Phil Mickelson dazzled the sports world by winning the PGA and becoming the oldest player to win a major.
Phil Mickelson was talking to a writer about the LIV Golf Series - that's L-I-V - LIV Golf Series - backed by Saudi Arabia.
Because" he said, "it's an opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates."
I mean, Phil Mickelson has been a very popular champion, right?

As a club pro at GCU Golf Course, Mueller’s days are filled with administrative tasks and teaching.
And shortly after he poked the ball down the fairway on the par-4 10th hole in his first PGA Championship start, Mueller had a moment better than anyone else’s on Day 1.
“What a start to my first ever PGA Championship,” Mueller said.
The reigning PGA Club Pro champion added a birdie at the 17th — sandwiched by two bogeys — to turn in one-under 34.

     2022 PGA Championship scores, takeaways: Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas impress with strong bookend efforts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TULSA, Okla. -- Rory McIlroy shot the round of the day with his 65 to open the 2022 PGA Championship, but Justin Thomas followed him with an effort that was nearly as impressive.
Somewhat incredibly, both Phil Mickelson (51, not attending this PGA) and Tiger Woods (46, barely barely walking around Southern Hills) have won majors more recently than Thomas and McIlroy.
This is the first time he's led or co-led a major round since 2014 (coincidentally, the last time he won, which was also the PGA).
And although Zalatoris has the confidence and the game to do so, it would still be mildly surprising if he held off McIlroy, Thomas and others for the first win of his career.
2) and Tiger Woods (Tiger Woods!)
