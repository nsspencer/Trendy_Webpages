     Summary: File Photo by Bill Greenblatt/UPI | License PhotoMay 19 (UPI) -- Left wing Matthew Tkachuk scored three goals to help the Calgary Flames beat the Edmonton Oilers 9-6 in Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinal series.
Advertisement"That was probably our worst game of the playoffs so far," Tkachuk told reporters.
Flames right wing Brett Ritchie pushed the lead to three goals with another score 6:05 into the first period.
Defenseman Evan Bouchard scored a minute later, but Tkachuk answered with a power-play goal 74 seconds after the Oilers' second score.
The Flames will host the Oilers in Game 2 at 10:30 p.m. EDT Friday in Calgary.

     Summary: Game 1 had everything we were looking for in the Battle of Alberta and more.
The Calgary Flames beat the Edmonton Oilers 9-6 after giving up a 3-0 lead.
Old school hockey fans loved it.
It was fitting that Tkachuk finished with a hat-trick, given how much the Oilers clearly hate him.
But Game 1 of the Battle of Alberta was everything hockey fans were hoping for, and, hopefully, we get six more wars before it's all said and done.

Final Edmonton Oilers 6 Calgary Flames 9If you watched this game you probably don’t want to relive this game because it was a terrible effort by the Edmonton Oilers.
The Edmonton Oilers in my opinion were lucky to even have a chance to win this game.
Jacob MarkstromI think the Edmonton Oilers missed a chance to win a game when Markstrom plays a bad game.
If the Edmonton Oilers would have converted on any of their 4 powerplays that actually could have won this game.

     Summary: It’s safe to say nobody expected what happened in Calgary on Wednesday night in game one between the Flames and Edmonton Oilers.
Things were far from perfect for the Calgary Flames, but even worse for the Edmonton Oilers who had an all-too-familiar feeling walking out with a 9-6 loss.
“We gave up a goal at the start of the second period as well.
There were really no good Oilers last night, but the Josh Archibald – Ryan Nugent-Hopkins duo got exposed.
Well, that wasn’t an issue in Game 1 of their series with the Edmonton Oilers.
