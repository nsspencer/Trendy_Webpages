Woods finds the greenside bunker and gets up and down for par, keeping him at two over.
McIlroy makes par and stays at five under, which is now only one shot clear of Tom Hoge, who birdies the 15th to climb to four under.
Up ahead at the long par-3 eighth, Will Zalatoris pulls off a wild up-and-down par save from well over the green to keep it at three under.
