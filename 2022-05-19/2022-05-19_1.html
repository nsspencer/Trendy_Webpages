     Tiger Woods Struggles at the P.G.A. Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tiger Woods returned to a major championship on Thursday, and after a good start, things started to go awry.
Playing in a star-studded group with Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy, Woods finished at four over par at the P.G.A.
Championship.
Championship, Woods at first showed few obvious signs of the severe leg injuries he sustained in a car crash in February 2021.
Toward the end of his first nine holes, he appeared to start limping a little more.

     PGA Championship 2022: An on-fire McIlroy, an out-of-sorts Spieth and nine other surprises from Thursday at Southern Hills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There was a time when Koepka seemed to own this event, but that time is definitively past.
His titles in 2018 and 2019 felt like a distant memory on Thursday, when he started poorly with a bogey at the first and only got worse, stumbling to a front-nine 40.
A late look at his strokes-gained stats is close to agonizing; he was 144th in the field off the tee, 137th tee to green and 141st around the green.
It took him four holes to hit a fairway, and though he also managed a green in regulation on the fourth, he three-putted for his third bogey of the day.
If you happened to put any money on him this week, The Loop's tweet says it all:

     Tiger Woods Hobbles to 74 in Opening Round at PGA Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Woods made five bogeys in his final nine holes of the first round and he'll have to battle to make the 36-hole cut on Friday.
Tiger Woods shot a 4-over 74 in Round 1 at the PGA Championship.
Playing alongside top-10 players Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, Woods acknowledged that he was in pain afterward.
While he hit 10 if 14 fairways, Woods hit just 7 of 18 greens and got up and down just 4 of 11 times.
From there, he flew the green, hit a flop shot that came up short, and needed to make a 4-footer for bogey.
