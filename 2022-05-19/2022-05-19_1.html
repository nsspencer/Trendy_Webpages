He may not draw the fans of the Tiger/Rory/Spieth pairing, but that doesn’t mean that the 39-year-old from Scottsdale, Ariz., can’t make some noise of his own.

     Tiger Woods: My Leg Feels OK, as Long as I Don’t Play Golf
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TULSA, Okla. — Tiger Woods has a good sense of humor, though it is rare for him to use it in a public setting.
What was once unthinkable for him — playfully mocking his poor play on the golf course — is one of his new, winsome tools.
On Thursday, six weeks after his stirring comeback at the Masters Tournament, Woods returned to competitive golf in the first round of the P.G.A.
A couple of holes later, Woods was limping a lot, even sometimes using a golf club like a cane to ascend or descend hills.
Woods added that he could not put weight on his right leg in his backswing — known as loading — and he also struggled to push off his leg on the downswing, too.

     Tiger Woods Hobbles to 74 in Opening Round at PGA Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Woods made five bogeys in his final nine holes of the first round and he'll have to battle to make the 36-hole cut on Friday.
Tiger Woods shot a 4-over 74 in Round 1 at the PGA Championship.
Playing alongside top-10 players Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, Woods acknowledged that he was in pain afterward.
While he hit 10 if 14 fairways, Woods hit just 7 of 18 greens and got up and down just 4 of 11 times.
From there, he flew the green, hit a flop shot that came up short, and needed to make a 4-footer for bogey.

     Summary: (0:23)TULSA, Okla. -- Rory McIlroy won't have to worry about back-dooring a top-5 finish at a major championship after he grabbed the first-round lead at the 104th PGA Championship at Southern Hills Country Club on Friday.
It's the first time McIlroy has led after the first round of a major since his last victory in one, the 2014 PGA Championship at Valhalla.
He made 150 feet of putts, his most in any PGA Tour round, and made four putts longer than 20 feet.
