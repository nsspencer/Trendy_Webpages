     Tiger Woods: My Leg Feels OK, as Long as I Don’t Play Golf
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TULSA, Okla. — Tiger Woods has a good sense of humor, though it is rare for him to use it in a public setting.
What was once unthinkable for him — playfully mocking his poor play on the golf course — is one of his new, winsome tools.
On Thursday, six weeks after his stirring comeback at the Masters Tournament, Woods returned to competitive golf in the first round of the P.G.A.
A couple of holes later, Woods was limping a lot, even sometimes using a golf club like a cane to ascend or descend hills.
Woods added that he could not put weight on his right leg in his backswing — known as loading — and he also struggled to push off his leg on the downswing, too.

     Tiger Woods Hobbles to 74 in Opening Round at PGA Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Woods made five bogeys in his final nine holes of the first round and he'll have to battle to make the 36-hole cut on Friday.
Tiger Woods shot a 4-over 74 in Round 1 at the PGA Championship.
Playing alongside top-10 players Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, Woods acknowledged that he was in pain afterward.
While he hit 10 if 14 fairways, Woods hit just 7 of 18 greens and got up and down just 4 of 11 times.
From there, he flew the green, hit a flop shot that came up short, and needed to make a 4-footer for bogey.
