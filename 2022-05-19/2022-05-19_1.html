     Tiger Woods Is Struggling at the P.G.A. Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tiger Woods returned to a major championship on Thursday, and after a good start things started to go awryPlaying in a star-studded group with Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy, Woods was at two over through 13 holes of the P.G.A.
Championship.
Playing at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Okla., where he won the 2007 P.G.A.
Championship, Woods at first showed few obvious signs of the severe leg injuries he sustained in a car accident in February 2021.
Woods returned to the majors at the Masters last month after missing more than 500 days of top-flight golf following the accident.

     PGA Championship 2022 live updates: Rory McIlroy leads, Tiger Woods off to solid start at Southern Hills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 12:42 p.m.: Tiger makes a much-needed bounce back birdie at No.
With the wind already picking up and possibly whipping even harder this afternoon, even par could look like a pretty good score by day's end.
No doubt that's the number on Woods' mind now with six holes remaining in his first round.
Speaking of bounce backs, Will Zalatoris has also bounced back after that short miss at the 18th.
McIlroy is still your leader at five under, and no one else has even reached four under yet.
