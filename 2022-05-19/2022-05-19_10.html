     Chelsea v Leicester: Expected XI for final away game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leicester City take on Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the penultimate game of the season for the two clubs.
The Foxes enter the game full of confidence after a resounding 5-1 victory over Watford at Vicarage Road.
Kasper Schmeichel will return in the net after Danny Ward was given his first Premier League start for LCFC against the Hornets last time out.
Vardy also celebrated 10 years at the club earlier this week, after he joined Leicester City from Fleetwood Town in 2012.
However, with the East Midlands side facing the difficult task of travelling to Stamford Bridge for their final away game of the season, Lookman would be the better option to start at right wing.

     Summary: Welcome to the penultimate game of the season, on the 10th Anniversary of our historic first Champions League triumph.
It’s a day to celebrate and reminisce, and also hopefully take in some football fun.
We do technically need one more point to guarantee a third place finish, but that’s academic at this point.
Tuchel talked about looking for players who are fit and still hungry to play, so we have just a couple changes from the FA Cup final, with Ziyech and Kanté coming in.
Here we go!

     Summary: Todd Boehly has been spotted in attendance at Stamford Bridge again as his Chelsea Football Club takeover nears its completion.
The American businessman is leading a consortium who have agreed to a deal to take over at Chelsea, and he is in attendance for this evening's clash with Leicester City.
Boehly was also present for the Blues' last home game against Wolves, where the side threw away a two-goal lead late on at the Bridge.
Now, the American was once again spotted in attendance for the penultimate match of the Premier League season.
"This includes investments in Stamford Bridge, the Academy, the Women's Team and Kingsmeadow and continued funding for the Chelsea Foundation.

     Summary: Marcos Alonso's goal against Leicester all but ensures Chelsea will finish third in the Premier League this season.
Getty ImagesChelsea defender Marco Alonso scored a glorious equaliser to earn a 1-1 home draw with Leicester City on Thursday and effectively seal third place in the Premier League ahead of the final round of fixtures.
The draw lifted Chelsea to 71 points, 19 behind leaders Manchester City and three ahead of Tottenham Hotspur in fourth, but Chelsea's far superior goal difference means Spurs have no realistic chance of overtaking them.
"We created enough to win, didn't allow transition and chances for Leicester, so I am fine with the performance.
Chelsea round off their league campaign at home to relegated Watford on Sunday when Leicester, who are in ninth place on 49 points, host Southampton.

     Summary: But I’m sure he, like everyone else associated with the club, will be happy to put this season in the rearview mirror.
Here is the gambling guide for the match between Chelsea and Leicester CityWhile Chelsea supporters will certainly be feeling fatigued after the rollercoaster that was 2021/22, fans of the Foxes are likely carrying a similar sentiment.
Leicester City is one of the strangest sides in the Premier League this season.
Both teams to find the back of the net at -135 odds is a pretty strong play, in my opinion.
I’m really not seeing either side go all-out with nothing left to play for, though, so I like the under at -170.
