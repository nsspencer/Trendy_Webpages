     Everton vs Crystal Palace LIVE: Premier League result and score as fans invade pitch after Dominic Calvert-Lewin goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Getty Images)Follow live reaction as Everton came from two goals down at half-time to beat Crystal Palace and secure their Premier League safety at a raucous Goodison Park.
Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s 85th minute winner rescued Frank Lampard’s side and sparked a pitch invasion from the home supporters, after goals from Michael Keane and Richarlison pulled them level.
At half-time, and with Burnley leading Aston Villa, Everton were facing the possibility of needing to go to Arsenal on the final day of the season and getting a result.
Michael Keane got one back after half-time to spark the comeback, and Richarlison equalised with 15 minutes of normal time remaining with a scrambled finish.
But Calvert-Lewin’s header was greeted by wild scenes - which continued at full-time as the Toffees celebrated staying in the Premier League.
