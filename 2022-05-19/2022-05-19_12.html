     Fans Are Worried That the Migos May Have Broken up for Good
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It looks like the Migos may have some “Straightenin'” to do — pun intended!
Ever since the hip-hop music trio stepped on the scene in 2008, fans have been in awe with their artistry.
The group is known for creating trap music with a dose of mumble rap that has shifted the genre and influenced their ever-growing fanbase.
Thanks to the Migos' hit songs that include “Versace,” “Bad and Boujee,” “Stir Fry,” and more, the group has been a mainstay in hip-hop for more than a decade.
However, it appears that trouble may be looming within the group.

     Did Migos Breakup? Offset Unfollows Quavo and Takeoff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Migos are sparking breakup rumors after some of the rappers have recently unfollowed each other on Instagram.
Why else would Offset unfollow Quavo and Takeoff,” a concerned fan tweeted on Wednesday, May 18.
Offset, who is married to Cardi B, recently unfollowed both Takeoff and Quavo on Instagram.
Takeoff still follows Offset, but Quavo returned the favor and unfollowed his cousin.
Getty ImagesHowever, the potential breakup may have stemmed from tensions as Quavo and Takeoff are releasing a new project “Hotel Lobby” on Friday, May 20.

     ‘Unc and Phew’: Migos’ Quavo and Takeoff Announce Single ‘Hotel Lobby’ Sans Offset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two-thirds of Migos have a new single on the way.
On Wednesday, Quavo and Takeoff (but they’re going as Unc &amp; Phew for this one) announced the release of a new single titled “Hotel Lobby” — and it doesn’t include the third member of their rap group, Offset.
“Unc And Phew Presents The Hotel Lobby Friday!” Quavo wrote on Instagram, posting the cover art which shows the two men looking back at the camera from the front seats of a convertible.
The single news was also shared on Migos’ Instagram page as commenters asked “where is Offset?” Some also noticed that both Offset and his wife Cardi B had unfollowed Quavo and Takeoff on the social media platform.
The release of Quavo and Takeoff’s new single comes nearly a year after Migos released Culture III last June.

     Migos May No Longer Be Amigos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Jon Kopaloff/Getty ImagesReal heads, to the extent that there are Migos-heads, know that “Migos” is short for amigos.
On May 18, Quavo announced a new single with his bandmate Takeoff, under the duo name Unc and Phew (since, as Migos-heads know, Quavo is Takeoff’s uncle).
What’s more, as Stereogum noted, Quavo had previously teased a tour around Migos’ 2021 album Culture III, but those shows were never announced.
Think Migos is short for “Enemigos” now?

     Quavo Dodges Questions About Offset, Migos Break-Up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Play video content BACKGRIDQuavo and Offset are on the outs again, and this time it means Migos is done as a group -- at least that's the online buzz, and Quavo isn't doing anything to put out that fire.
All the talk about Migos' demise stems from 2 things: Quavo's new Offset-less project and a bunch of social media UNfollows.
The new duo's taking the name Unc &amp; Phew, due to their family ties — but Quavo deftly dodged the topic of Offset.
Offset and Cardi B stopped following Quavo and Takeoff on Instagram, and Quavo stopped unfollowed Offset and Cardi.
Quavo isn't saying, which makes us lean toward this being a skillful marketing scheme for Unc &amp; Phew.
