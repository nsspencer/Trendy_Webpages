     Report: Wells Fargo staged 'fake' job interviews for Black, female candidates according to former Jacksonville exec
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Times reports that diverse candidates would regularly be interviewed for sham jobs that were already filled or promised to somebody else.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Management level employees at Wells Fargo allegedly held "fake interviews" with people of color and women in order to falsify diversity efforts, the New York Times reported Thursday.
Bruno is reportedly one of at least seven current and former Wells Fargo employees who have made similar claims against the company, The Times reports.
The Times reports that Wells Fargo adopted a formal policy that requires management to bring in and interview a profile of candidates that were diverse for available jobs paying more than $100,000 annually.
In an interview with The Times, he tells Emily Flitter that Wells Fargo retaliated against him for blowing the whistle on a practice that was “inappropriate, morally wrong, ethically wrong.”Wells Fargo told The Times that he was fired for retaliating against a fellow employee.

     Former Wells Fargo exec says company held fake job interviews for minorities
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today (May 19), news broke that Wells Fargo allegedly held fake job interviews with people of color even though hiring managers had no intentions of offering them a position.
Bruno told The New York Times that he was fired after bringing up the situation to his bosses.
According to the outlet, the former executive told his superiors that the “fake interviews” were “inappropriate, morally wrong, ethically wrong.”Sources say that Wells Fargo employees were instructed to recruit “diverse” candidates, but these applicants never actually had a shot.
Mayor Adams also said the city would no longer open accounts with the bank due to their alleged discriminatory practices.
“In light of this persisting track record of discrimination, New York City will not be opening any new depository accounts with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

     At Wells Fargo, a Quest to Increase Diversity Leads to Fake Job Interviews
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The rule was devised after researchers demonstrated to league officials that Black coaches were being shut out of job opportunities.
Mr. Bruno joined Wells Fargo in 2000 and worked his way up to market leader for Wells Fargo Advisors in Jacksonville, Fla.
Mr. Bruno was mainly responsible for filling two categories of jobs — financial advisers and financial consultants, who work alongside advisers.
In most such cases, Wells had no intention of hiring those people because either he or his superiors had already picked someone for the job, Mr. Bruno said.
Mr. Bruno said he eventually refused to conduct the interviews.

     Summary: Wells Fargo employees conducted "fake interviews" with diverse job candidates, The NY Times reports.
Three current Wells Fargo employees told The Times that the fake interviews had been conducted as recently as this year.
He said he was dismissed in retaliation for raising his concerns, while Wells Fargo told The Times he was let go because he retaliated against a colleague.
A Wells Fargo spokesperson told Insider in a statement that the company investigated The Times' claims and "could not corroborate the claims as factual."
His comments, which he reiterated during a Zoom meeting with employees that summer, angered some employees, and Scharf issued an apology.

     Did Wells Fargo Really Schedule Fake Interviews to Dodge Diversity?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What Is Going On With Wells Fargo?
Financial giant Wells Fargo (WFC.PRN) is now being heavily scrutinized for its alleged attempts to fake diversity efforts.
Former executive Joe Bruno claims that he was fired in August 2021 after telling superiors that the "fake interviews" he was instructed to hold were "inappropriate, morally wrong, ethically wrong."
Another former Wells Fargo manager, Tony Thorpe, said that he did not conduct fake interviews.
But Wells Fargo also has good reasons for wanting to appear like it's making an effort since the bank has several diversity-related scandals in its past.

     Wells Fargo accused of scheduling FAKE job interviews with black applicants to boost diversity stats
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A former employee has accused Wells Fargo of scheduling fake interviews with black and female candidates for roles that were already filled in order to boost the bank's diversity statistics.
Bruno says that he was instructed to conduct interviews with black candidates for the lower-paying financial adviser and financial consultant positions, despite the fact that he or his superiors had already picked someone for that job.
Five other people also came forward and said they were aware of the practice, or took part in arranging the interviews, the Times reported.
According to the employees, some of which remained anonymous out of fear of losing their jobs, the interviews were a ploy to boost the bank's diversity efforts in anticipation of possible regulatory audits instead of actually diversifying the bank's workforce.
The claims come two years after CEO Charles W. Scharafter pledged to increase diversity following the murder of George Floyd in June 2020.
