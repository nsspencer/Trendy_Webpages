     Trying to condemn the war in Ukraine, Bush inadvertently calls Iraq war unjustified
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trying to condemn the war in Ukraine, Bush inadvertently calls Iraq war unjustifiedFormer President George W. Bush was criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday when his old nemesis, the verbal slip, struck again.
Bush eventually condemned Putin's invasion of Ukraine — but not before he condemned "a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq."
Bush was drawing a parallel between how countries conduct elections and their stance toward other nations when his tongue went rogue.
"The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia, and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq — I mean of Ukraine," Bush said.
In Thursday's speech, Bush was comparing the free and fair election of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Putin's suppression of his political opponents.

     Summary: War in Ukraine: What you need to knowThe latest: Ukrainian fighters have ended their weeks-long defense of a besieged steel plant in the strategic port city of Mariupol.
The fight: A slowly regenerating Russian army is making incremental gains in eastern Ukraine against valiant but underequipped Ukrainian forces.
The United States and its allies are racing to deliver the enormous quantities of weaponry the Ukrainians urgently need if they are to hold the Russians at bay.
The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies.
Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

     George W Bush accidentally admits Iraq war was ‘unjustified and brutal’ in gaffe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sigmund Freud was unavailable for comment, but George W Bush saying Iraq instead of Ukraine when condemning “a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion” certainly suggests he still has a lot on his unconscious mind.
Bush has already told us that the fiasco of Iraq’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction still troubles him.
It broke Iraq and set off a sectarian civil war in which hundreds of thousands of people died.
Putin has cynically copied from the Iraq playbook the Bush administration left behind, with spurious claims of Ukrainian WMD.
Wednesday’s Bushism was a reminder that for all the former president’s aw shucks self-deprecatory jokes about Iraq, it was never really funny.

     George W. Bush Calls Iraq Invasion Unjustified in Gaffe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bush noted that Zelenskyy, whom he described as a “cool little guy,” and “the Churchill of the 21st century” was empowered by electoral legitimacy before leading the defense of his country against the Russian invasion.
But during his 10-minute speech, Bush also made a verbal faux pas while referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Bush noted has brutally stifled popular dissent and had political opponents imprisoned.
“The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia, and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq,” Bush said, before wincing and correcting himself.
Then, Bush shrugged and said under his breath: “Iraq, too.”The crowd erupted in laughter after Bush blamed the mistake on his age — 75.
Bush oversaw the 2003 preemptive invasion of Iraq, which critics have called both brutal and unjustified.

     George W. Bush Iraq-Ukraine Gaffe: 4 Unanswerable Questions

     Summary: Photo: @michaeldamianw/TwitterToday in things I wish I could go back and tell my 2003 self, George W. Bush accidentally condemned “the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq” during a speech in Dallas.
My response to George W. Bush's bizarre Freudian slip, confusing Ukraine &amp; Iraq, while hosting #MSNBCPrime tonight:pic.twitter.com/tijp5QVvWY — Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) May 19, 2022On the other hand, come on.
The former president was speaking at an event titled “Elections — A More Perfect Union,” which was hosted by the George W. Bush Institute.
What is the George W. Bush Institute, anyway?
As amazing as that clip is, I feel like we’re not commenting enough on the fact that there is something called the “George W. Bush Institute” and that its logo is a US flag in book form.
