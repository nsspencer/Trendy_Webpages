     Harry Styles’ ‘Today’ show outfit compared to candy canes, caterpillars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He wore the striped ensemble to perform on the "Today" show.
The “As It Was” singer, 28, performed on the “Today” show Thursday in a striped JW Anderson jumpsuit that — as with most things he wears — quickly sparked memes.
“Why is Harry Styles looking like [a] candy cane,” one fan tweeted, sharing side-by-side photos of the former One Direction member’s look and a similarly striped sweet.
Styles explained his outfit choice during the show, saying, “Well, it’s early, so I wanted to be comfortable.
And I thought I could soak up some of the rain with this.”Fans of the star camped out in the downpour to see Styles perform at the “Today” Plaza.

     Harry Styles: Harry’s House
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Five years ago, in the run-up to his debut album, Harry Styles got that quintessential rock’n’roll treatment: A sprawling 6,000 words by the celebrated journalist and filmmaker Cameron Crowe.
Styles’ appearance in the June issue of that publication—which runs articles about organic fertilizer and Meyer lemons and rarely profiles musicians at all, much less those of Styles’ stature—brushes off the music press and cleverly promotes Harry’s House, his third album.
On TikTok, Harry’s House single “As It Was” is a go-to soundtrack for supercuts of curated domesticity.
On Harry’s House, pleasure is the aesthetic proposition.

     Review: Harry Styles takes it to the bedroom on ‘Harry’s House’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s called “Harry’s House,” but the much-anticipated new album by the hottest male pop star on the planet — that would be, duh, Harry Styles — plays more like “Harry’s Boudoir.”Indeed, the sexy intimacy on Styles’ third solo album makes you feel like you’re peeking through the bedroom door as the former One Direction heartthrob is putting it down with his current flame, actress Olivia Wilde.
And whatever’s on the menu, you’ll just be like, “I’ll have what he’s having.”The cover of Harry Styles’ third solo album, “Harry’s House.” Sony MusicAnd Styles is having his way with you — and whoever you happen to be getting down with in any corner of your house — on his sexiest album to date.

When the album ends with “Love of My Life” — which couldn’t possibly be about anyone other than Wilde — Styles sounds positively smitten.

You’ll find Styles’s girlfriend, Olivia Wilde, throughout Harry’s House, with some of the most clear references to their relationship on “Cinema”: “I guess we’re in time / If you’re getting yourself wet for me,” he sings.
“I guess you’re all mine / When you’re sleeping in this bed with me.” Ahem, and now we know how comfortable the primary bedroom is!
Styles previously said he moved into his House while still promoting Fine Line, his second album.
Ever the homemaker, Styles even appeared on the cover of Better Homes &amp; Gardens to chat about Harry’s House.

     Harry Styles Moves Smoothly Into His Next Era With the Intimate ‘Harry’s House’: Album Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just over five years ago, Harry Styles dropped a solo debut that absolutely no one saw coming, especially from a guy who had closed the door on his role as lead heartthrob in pop juggernaut One Direction only 18 months earlier.
“Harry Styles” was a timeless, oddly genre-less album that sounded vaguely like a pop collection from the early 1970s, and like nothing else released that year.
Which isn’t to say it’s more of the same: “Harry’s House” is a bit more intimate and less stadium-sized than its predecessor.
The songs are largely about romance and sex, but turn darker when seemingly addressed to specific people or situations.
And at 28, no longer so young, he’s built himself an enviable solo career that “Harry’s House” goes a long way toward furthering.
