     Harry Styles is ready to invite you inside Harry's House
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And so it came to pass: Harry’s House, the third solo studio album from former One Direction star Harry Styles, has arrived on all the places albums go these days—music streaming services, YouTube bootlegs, and, presumably, physical media somewhere on the globe.
The release of the 13-track Harry’s House comes a few weeks after the unleashing of its first single, “As It Was ,” which has already accrued more than 472 million listens on Spotify alone.
Listening to Harry’s House, it’s definitely of a piece with “As It Was ”: Heavy on synths, a little dreamy, and very catchy.
We’ll leave it to the Styles scholars (and our own reviewers) to track the themes Styles is tackling here, but it’s certainly a breezy listen on a spring evening.
AdvertisementThe release of Harry’s House punctuates a busy period for Styles, who continues to occasionally bulk out his acting career in addition to being one of the most successful musicians on the planet.

In honor of his third studio album, "Harry's House," which will be released tomorrow, the "Watermelon Sugar" singer headed to the plaza stage for Citi Concert Series on TODAY on Thursday.
The callout for Styles’ performance broke records at TODAY, with approximately 50,000 people requesting Fan Passes to see him perform.
In February 2020, he was the last singer to take the stage at TODAY’s Citi Summer Concert Series before New York City went into lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
He told TODAY that “Harry’s House” is his “most diverse” album to date since it was influenced by different people in his life.

     Harry Styles: Harry’s House
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Five years ago, in the run-up to his debut album, Harry Styles got that quintessential rock’n’roll treatment: A sprawling 6,000 words by the celebrated journalist and filmmaker Cameron Crowe.
Styles’ appearance in the June issue of that publication—which runs articles about organic fertilizer and Meyer lemons and rarely profiles musicians at all, much less those of Styles’ stature—brushes off the music press and cleverly promotes Harry’s House, his third album.
On TikTok, Harry’s House single “As It Was” is a go-to soundtrack for supercuts of curated domesticity.
On Harry’s House, pleasure is the aesthetic proposition.

     Review: Harry Styles takes it to the bedroom on ‘Harry’s House’

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s called “Harry’s House,” but the much-anticipated new album by the hottest male pop star on the planet — that would be, duh, Harry Styles — plays more like “Harry’s Boudoir.”Indeed, the sexy intimacy on Styles’ third solo album makes you feel like you’re peeking through the bedroom door as the former One Direction heartthrob is putting it down with his current flame, actress Olivia Wilde.
And whatever’s on the menu, you’ll just be like, “I’ll have what he’s having.”The cover of Harry Styles’ third solo album, “Harry’s House.” Sony MusicAnd Styles is having his way with you — and whoever you happen to be getting down with in any corner of your house — on his sexiest album to date.

When the album ends with “Love of My Life” — which couldn’t possibly be about anyone other than Wilde — Styles sounds positively smitten.

     Harry Styles Moves Smoothly Into His Next Era With the Intimate ‘Harry’s House’: Album Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just over five years ago, Harry Styles dropped a solo debut that absolutely no one saw coming, especially from a guy who had closed the door on his role as lead heartthrob in pop juggernaut One Direction only 18 months earlier.
“Harry Styles” was a timeless, oddly genre-less album that sounded vaguely like a pop collection from the early 1970s, and like nothing else released that year.
Which isn’t to say it’s more of the same: “Harry’s House” is a bit more intimate and less stadium-sized than its predecessor.
The songs are largely about romance and sex, but turn darker when seemingly addressed to specific people or situations.
And at 28, no longer so young, he’s built himself an enviable solo career that “Harry’s House” goes a long way toward furthering.
