     Review: Harry Styles is fully at home in 'Harry's House'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If the 13 tracks of Harry Styles’ third LP are the walls in which he lives, “Harry’s House” is a place of self-expression, happiness and healingHarry Styles, “Harry's House” (Columbia Records)If the 13 tracks of Harry Styles’ third LP are the walls in which he lives, “Harry’s House” is a place of self-expression, happiness and healing.
From the jubilant, funky “Cinema,” to the meandering cruiser “Keep Driving,” Styles shows a breadth of style that matches the album’s emotional range.
It’s a single that teases Styles’ comfort with vulnerability — something that he displays countless times on the record.
In “Harry’s House,” Styles proves his talent for storytelling — whether it's his own stories of pain or joy or putting himself in the shoes of another.
“Harry’s House” finds him at his best — free, observant and content.

     Summary: He wore the striped ensemble to perform on the "Today" show.

“Why is Harry Styles looking like [a] candy cane,” one fan tweeted, sharing side-by-side photos of the former One Direction member’s look and a similarly striped sweet.
Styles explained his outfit choice during the show, saying, “Well, it’s early, so I wanted to be comfortable.
And I thought I could soak up some of the rain with this.”Fans of the star camped out in the downpour to see Styles perform at the “Today” Plaza.

     5 Takeaways from Harry Styles’ New Album, Harry’s House
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In March, Styles announced his forthcoming third album, Harry’s House.
Harry’s House favors a poppier sound with plenty of synthy ’80s moments and some indie pop touches.
After some self-reflection, he “realized that that home feeling isn’t something that you get from a house; it’s more of an internal thing.” That said, much of the action on Harry’s House revolves around physical spaces.
Guess who’s staying at Harry’s HouseHarry’s House reunites Styles with Kid Harpoon and Tyler Johnson, his main production team since his 2017 debut.
That’s a voice memo from Styles’ goddaughter Ruby Winston, the child of Ben Winston, an executive producer on Styles’ buddy James Corden’s The Late Late Show.

     Summary: On “Boyfriends” — a lovely, Laurel Canyon-ish acoustic ballad from his new album, “Harry’s House” — Harry Styles runs down some of the many reasons such figures are to be avoided.
“They take you for granted,” he sings, close harmonizing with himself like a one-man Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.
And indeed, the rest of “Harry’s House,” due Friday, is filled with tender assurances of his emotional availability (not to mention his erotic ingenuity).

The album’s most moving moment comes at the end of what Styles delineates in the liner notes as Side A.
