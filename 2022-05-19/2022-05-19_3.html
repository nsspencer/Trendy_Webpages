     Harry Styles takes over the TODAY plaza with unforgettable performances
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harry Styles has taken over Rockefeller Plaza!
In honor of his third studio album, "Harry's House," which will be released tomorrow, the "Watermelon Sugar" singer headed to the plaza stage for Citi Concert Series on TODAY on Thursday.
The callout for Styles’ performance broke records at TODAY, with approximately 50,000 people requesting Fan Passes to see him perform.
In February 2020, he was the last singer to take the stage at TODAY’s Citi Summer Concert Series before New York City went into lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
He told TODAY that “Harry’s House” is his “most diverse” album to date since it was influenced by different people in his life.

     Harry Styles’ ‘Today’ show outfit compared to candy canes, caterpillars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He wore the striped ensemble to perform on the "Today" show.
The “As It Was” singer, 28, performed on the “Today” show Thursday in a striped JW Anderson jumpsuit that — as with most things he wears — quickly sparked memes.
“Why is Harry Styles looking like [a] candy cane,” one fan tweeted, sharing side-by-side photos of the former One Direction member’s look and a similarly striped sweet.
Styles explained his outfit choice during the show, saying, “Well, it’s early, so I wanted to be comfortable.
And I thought I could soak up some of the rain with this.”Fans of the star camped out in the downpour to see Styles perform at the “Today” Plaza.

     Harry Styles Has a New Album—and Even More Wild Style
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And while Harry Styles has long embraced a sort of nouveau glam-rock style, the release of Harry's House, his album out tomorrow, brings with it a same-but-different spin on his deeply confident personal style.
And while, for this rollout, he’s still wearing playful outfits that nod to old and new trends in genderless dressing, he's also changing things up a bit.
(On the Harry’s House album cover, he wears a casual, Laurel Canyon-y outfit complete with ballet flats by the British designer Molly Goddard, who is typically known for her frothy dresses.)
And this particular jumpsuit, as the diligent Instagram fan account Harry Styles Fashion Archive observed, is also quite similar to another custom JW Anderson piece Styles wore in a recent promo shoot.
Here in the proverbial House of Harry, comfort—or at least an iteration of it fit for an arena pop star—seems to be a throughline.

     Summary: If the 13 tracks of Harry Styles’ third LP are the walls in which he lives, “Harry’s House” is a place of self-expression, happiness and healingHarry Styles, “Harry's House” (Columbia Records)If the 13 tracks of Harry Styles’ third LP are the walls in which he lives, “Harry’s House” is a place of self-expression, happiness and healing.
From the jubilant, funky “Cinema,” to the meandering cruiser “Keep Driving,” Styles shows a breadth of style that matches the album’s emotional range.
It’s a single that teases Styles’ comfort with vulnerability — something that he displays countless times on the record.
In “Harry’s House,” Styles proves his talent for storytelling — whether it's his own stories of pain or joy or putting himself in the shoes of another.
“Harry’s House” finds him at his best — free, observant and content.

     Harry Styles Says Olivia Wilde Was ‘Very Helpful’ on Set
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As I’m sure you’re well aware, Styles is currently dating Olivia Wilde.
They met on the set of Don’t Worry Darling, the forthcoming psychological thriller starring Styles and Florence Pugh and directed by Wilde.
Anyway, Stern tried, unsuccessfully, to get Styles to confirm whether the song is about Wilde.
Stern, always the subtle interviewer, asked Styles point blank, “You fell in love on a movie set?” To which Styles said, “I had a wonderful experience being directed by Olivia.” Styles continued playing coy, adding, “Acting is kind of uncomfortable at times; you have to trust a lot.
It meant for a really nice experience working on Don’t Worry Darling.”So there you have it: Harry Styles trusts Olivia Wilde and found her “very helpful” on set.

     Sexed up and sensitive, Harry Styles stakes his claim as the perfect boyfriend and pop star
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On “Boyfriends” — a lovely, Laurel Canyon-ish acoustic ballad from his new album, “Harry’s House” — Harry Styles runs down some of the many reasons such figures are to be avoided.
“They take you for granted,” he sings, close harmonizing with himself like a one-man Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.
And indeed, the rest of “Harry’s House,” due Friday, is filled with tender assurances of his emotional availability (not to mention his erotic ingenuity).
Harry Styles’ new album, “Harry’s House.” (Sony Music)If Styles’ production choices have moved him closer to the Top 40 mainstream — “As It Was” entered Billboard’s Hot 100 at No.
The album’s most moving moment comes at the end of what Styles delineates in the liner notes as Side A.
