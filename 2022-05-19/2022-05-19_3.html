    </h2>

     Summary: If the 13 tracks of Harry Styles’ third LP are the walls in which he lives, “Harry’s House” is a place of self-expression, happiness and healingHarry Styles, “Harry's House” (Columbia Records)If the 13 tracks of Harry Styles’ third LP are the walls in which he lives, “Harry’s House” is a place of self-expression, happiness and healing.
From the jubilant, funky “Cinema,” to the meandering cruiser “Keep Driving,” Styles shows a breadth of style that matches the album’s emotional range.
It’s a single that teases Styles’ comfort with vulnerability — something that he displays countless times on the record.
In “Harry’s House,” Styles proves his talent for storytelling — whether it's his own stories of pain or joy or putting himself in the shoes of another.
“Harry’s House” finds him at his best — free, observant and content.

     Harry Styles’ ‘Today’ show outfit compared to candy canes, caterpillars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He wore the striped ensemble to perform on the "Today" show.
The “As It Was” singer, 28, performed on the “Today” show Thursday in a striped JW Anderson jumpsuit that — as with most things he wears — quickly sparked memes.
“Why is Harry Styles looking like [a] candy cane,” one fan tweeted, sharing side-by-side photos of the former One Direction member’s look and a similarly striped sweet.
Styles explained his outfit choice during the show, saying, “Well, it’s early, so I wanted to be comfortable.
And I thought I could soak up some of the rain with this.”Fans of the star camped out in the downpour to see Styles perform at the “Today” Plaza.

     Harry Styles: Harry’s House
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Five years ago, in the run-up to his debut album, Harry Styles got that quintessential rock’n’roll treatment: A sprawling 6,000 words by the celebrated journalist and filmmaker Cameron Crowe.
Styles’ appearance in the June issue of that publication—which runs articles about organic fertilizer and Meyer lemons and rarely profiles musicians at all, much less those of Styles’ stature—brushes off the music press and cleverly promotes Harry’s House, his third album.
On TikTok, Harry’s House single “As It Was” is a go-to soundtrack for supercuts of curated domesticity.
On Harry’s House, pleasure is the aesthetic proposition.
“I could cook an egg on you”: Harry Styles lyric or Denny’s tweet?

     Harry Styles Moves Smoothly Into His Next Era With the Intimate ‘Harry’s House’: Album Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just over five years ago, Harry Styles dropped a solo debut that absolutely no one saw coming, especially from a guy who had closed the door on his role as lead heartthrob in pop juggernaut One Direction only 18 months earlier.
“Harry Styles” was a timeless, oddly genre-less album that sounded vaguely like a pop collection from the early 1970s, and like nothing else released that year.
Which isn’t to say it’s more of the same: “Harry’s House” is a bit more intimate and less stadium-sized than its predecessor.
The songs are largely about romance and sex, but turn darker when seemingly addressed to specific people or situations.
And at 28, no longer so young, he’s built himself an enviable solo career that “Harry’s House” goes a long way toward furthering.

     Sexed up and sensitive, Harry Styles stakes his claim as the perfect boyfriend and pop star
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On “Boyfriends” — a lovely, Laurel Canyon-ish acoustic ballad from his new album, “Harry’s House” — Harry Styles runs down some of the many reasons such figures are to be avoided.
“They take you for granted,” he sings, close harmonizing with himself like a one-man Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.
And indeed, the rest of “Harry’s House,” due Friday, is filled with tender assurances of his emotional availability (not to mention his erotic ingenuity).
Harry Styles’ new album, “Harry’s House.” (Sony Music)If Styles’ production choices have moved him closer to the Top 40 mainstream — “As It Was” entered Billboard’s Hot 100 at No.
The album’s most moving moment comes at the end of what Styles delineates in the liner notes as Side A.
