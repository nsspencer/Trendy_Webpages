     Summary: But, what exactly is Boxing Day?
Boxing Day originsBoxing Day is a centuries-old gift-giving day that originated in Britain.
Boxing Day in IrelandAccording to Almanac.com, Boxing Day in Ireland is also known as St. Stephen's Day after the saint who was a missionary in Sweden and had a fondness for animals -- in particular horses.
Boxing Day todayBy the 21st century, Boxing Day closely resembles "Black Friday" since the day has now become associated with shopping and sporting events, namely those involving horses (see above for 'Boxing Day in Ireland'), according to Almanac.com.
Charity and giving to those in need is still a big part of Boxing Day.
