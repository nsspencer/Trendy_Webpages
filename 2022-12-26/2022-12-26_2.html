     Summary: Ahead of Gameweek 17, Mitrovic was a doubt for Fulham's trip to Crystal Palace with a foot problem, and was ditched from 957,000+ teams.
Meanwhile, a knee injury for Gabriel Jesus (¬£8.0m) meant the Arsenal forward became the most-sold player ahead of Gameweek 17, shipped out by more than 2.2million managers.
The No 1 transfer target ahead of Gameweek 17, Toney followed up his brace against Manchester City in Gameweek 16 with a goal at home to Tottenham Hotspur.
It could make Salah a big Gameweek 17 differential after he got a goal and an assist in Liverpool's 3-1 win at Aston Villa.
De Bruyne, meanwhile, heads to Leeds having produced 16 points in his last encounter with them.
