     U.S. to examine Southwest Airlines cancellations, calls 'unacceptable'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dec 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department (USDOT) said late on Monday it would examine the large number of Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) cancelled and delayed flights in recent days to determine if they were in the airline's control, calling them "unacceptable."
"USDOT is concerned by Southwest Airlines’ disproportionate and unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays as well as the failure to properly support customers experiencing a cancellation or delay," the department said.
It said it would "closely examine whether cancellations were controllable and whether Southwest is complying with its customer service plan as well as all other pertinent DOT rules."
Southwest delayed 48% of flights on Sunday and 16% on Monday.
Other major U.S. airlines suffered significant cancellations in recent days but not nearly at as high rates as Southwest and they have now largely recovered.

     Airlines cancel thousands of flights amid winter storm chaos, with Southwest nixing 70%
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Most major airlines have canceled or delayed thousands of flights, with Southwest Airlines canceling at least 70% of its flights Monday -- more than 2,600 -- due to a reported system meltdown.
On Christmas Day, 42% of Southwest's flights were canceled and 48% were delayed, according to data from FlightAware.
Jay McVay with Southwest Airlines said Monday night that "the sheer size of the storm" nationwide affected all major airports.
Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said in a statement earlier Monday that the ordeal has "been catastrophic."
"As soon as I entered the line, they were just like, 'your flights canceled.

     Southwest Airlines Creates Chaos Across America: Travel Meltdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Litvak was just one of hundreds of thousands of Americans whose travel plans have been destroyed during a meltdown of epic proportions as Southwest Airlines has canceled thousands of flights across the country.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA - DECEMBER 26: Passengers lined up by the Southwest Airlines counter at San ... [+] Francisco International Airport (SFO) in San Francisco, California, United States on December 26, 2022 as Southwest cancels more than 2,800 U.S. flights on Monday amid fierce winter storms.
Southwest Airlines’ woes began after extreme winter weather paralyzed much of the United States starting late last week, stranding holiday travelers and creating a ripple effect of chaos at airports across the country.
Other airlines have also had issues, but Southwest’s problems have been cataclysmic—with the airline canceling 10 times as many flights as other carriers.
“The way Southwest Airlines has treated its flight crews can only be termed ‘despicable,’” Lyn Montgomery, the president of Southwest’s flight attendant union, told CNN.

     Southwest cancels more than 2,800 flights in a 'full-blown meltdown'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Southwest canceled more than 2,870 flights by 8:25 p.m.
The number of canceled flights for Southwest is more than 10 times higher than for Delta, which had the second-most cancelations by a U.S. airline with 265 flights called off.
But with many areas seeing clear skies on Monday, the airline would seem to have few obvious reasons to cancel so many flights.
"This is really as bad as it gets for an airline," Potter said.
To have extensive cancellations continue on Monday, Potter said, "is a clear, clear sign something has gone horribly wrong."
