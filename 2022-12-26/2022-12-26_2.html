     Cameroon Uses ‘Boxing Day’ to Aid Children Displaced by Separatist Conflict
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cameroon is marking Boxing Day, the day after Christmas when gifts are traditionally given to the poor, with a nationwide gift drive for internally displaced children.
Cameroon's government, churches and aid groups are working together to provide food, books, and school fees to tens of thousands of children displaced by the country's separatist conflict.
More than 300 children displaced by Cameroon’s separatist conflict gathered Monday at the Bandjoun Community Hall in the capital Yaounde to receive Boxing Day gifts.
While many churches and aid groups on Boxing Day support IDP children with gifts, including one time by first lady Chantal Biya, this year’s was the first to be coordinated nationwide.
Authorities say the Boxing Day gift drive aims to ease suffering for tens of thousands of children displaced by the separatist conflict, now in its fifth year.
