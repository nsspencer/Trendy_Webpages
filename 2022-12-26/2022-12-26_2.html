While the Colts have lost four in a row and seven of their last eight games, the Chargers can clinch a playoff berth with a win.
The Colts don’t have much to play for outside of playing spoiler, and the main focus now has shifted to their potential to be a team with a top-five pick.
With the Chargers as favorites in this game in the eyes of Vegas and the experts around the league, here’s how the Colts Wire staff sees this game shaking out:

     Chargers safety Derwin James Jr. ejected after brutal hit on Colts WR
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It didn't take long before everyone knew that Los Angeles Chargers safety Derwin James Jr. might be ejected for vicious a hit on Indianapolis Colts receiver Ashton Dulin.
James came in with the crown of his helmet and hit Dulin in the head and neck area after Dulin made a short catch.
"We've watched a lot of football, I don't know if I've seen a hit quite like that," ESPN analyst Troy Aikman said.
"That was as big of a collision as I've seen in a long, long time," Aikman said.
Dulin went back to the locker room shortly after the hit, and was later ruled out with a concussion.

     Chargers' Derwin James Jr. ejected after dangerous hit vs. Colts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Chargers star safety and defensive captain Derwin James Jr. was ejected after throwing a dangerous hit on Indianapolis Colts defenseless receiver Ashton Dulin.
As Dulin caught a pass from Colts quarterback Nick Foles, James was right there to meet him before the first-down marker.
While Dulin was sent into the Colts' locker room to check for a head injury, James also seemed a bit woozy when he tried to get up after the hit.
CHARGERS' JC JACKSON ARRESTED IN MASSACHUSETTS FOR ‘NON-VIOLENT FAMILY ISSUE,’ POLICE SAYJust two plays prior to the hit, James gave the Colts another 15 yards after ripping the facemask of receiver Michael Pittman Jr. off during a tackle.
The NFL has been making it a priority in recent seasons to crack down on these hits to the head among other unnecessary tackles in their eyes, especially roughing the passer calls.

     Chargers' Derwin James ejected for illegal hit vs. Colts' Ashton Dulin on 'Monday Night Football'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chargers got Derwin James back on Monday night, welcoming their star safety to the secondary after a two-game absence due to injury.
James' return was short-lived, however, after the veteran defensive back was ejected for leading with his helmet on a hard second-quarter hit in Week 16's matchup with the Colts.
James, meanwhile, visited the Chargers' blue medical tent after getting flagged for unnecessary roughness; officials quickly announced he'd also been disqualified for the hit.
The hit, which came two plays after James was penalized for a face mask on Michael Pittman Jr., appeared to affect the Chargers safety even more than Dulin, at least immediately afterward.
James missed the Chargers' previous two games with a quad injury.

"A lot of food gets thrown down," linebacker Kyle Van Noy said.
The dinners for defensive players started in September.
There's Mack and Joey Bosa, who has attended despite being on injured reserve since undergoing groin surgery following Week 3.
Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Khalil Mack (52) and defensive tackle Sebastian Joseph-Day (69) are among those breaking bread on Friday nights.
