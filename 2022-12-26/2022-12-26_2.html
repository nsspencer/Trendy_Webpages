     U.S. to examine Southwest Airlines cancellations, calls 'unacceptable'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dec 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department (USDOT) said late on Monday it would examine the large number of Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) cancelled and delayed flights in recent days to determine if they were in the airline's control, calling them "unacceptable."
"USDOT is concerned by Southwest Airlines’ disproportionate and unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays as well as the failure to properly support customers experiencing a cancellation or delay," the department said.
It said it would "closely examine whether cancellations were controllable and whether Southwest is complying with its customer service plan as well as all other pertinent DOT rules."
Southwest delayed 48% of flights on Sunday and 16% on Monday.
Other major U.S. airlines suffered significant cancellations in recent days but not nearly at as high rates as Southwest and they have now largely recovered.

     Summary: Southwest cancels more than 2,800 flights in a 'full-blown meltdown'Enlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesA historic winter storm has tangled holiday travel and brought dangerous conditions to a big chunk of the United States, but no airline has struggled more to navigate the Christmas holiday rush than Southwest Airlines.
Southwest canceled more than 2,870 flights by 8:25 p.m.
The number of canceled flights for Southwest is more than 10 times higher than for Delta, which had the second-most cancelations by a U.S. airline with 265 flights called off.
"This is really as bad as it gets for an airline," Potter said.
To have extensive cancellations continue on Monday, Potter said, "is a clear, clear sign something has gone horribly wrong."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Most major airlines have canceled or delayed thousands of flights, with Southwest Airlines canceling at least 70% of its flights Monday -- more than 2,600 -- due to a reported system meltdown.
On Christmas Day, 42% of Southwest's flights were canceled and 48% were delayed, according to data from FlightAware.
Jay McVay with Southwest Airlines said Monday night that "the sheer size of the storm" nationwide affected all major airports.
Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said in a statement earlier Monday that the ordeal has "been catastrophic."
"As soon as I entered the line, they were just like, 'your flights canceled.

     Flight attendants' union says Southwest Airlines failed workers: 'This impacts lives and threatens safety for all'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Southwest Airlines canceled more than 50% of its traffic through Denver International Airport according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking service.
McManus was among thousands of travelers with changed or spoiled plans thanks to cancellations and delays, a large majority of which were with Southwest Airlines.
Southwest representatives said the airline was fully staffed heading into the holiday weekend, but on Monday, the union representing some Southwest flight attendants criticized the airline for failing its employees.
"The way Southwest Airlines has treated its flight crews can only be termed 'despicable,'" said Lyn Montgomery, president of TWU Local 556.
But at this point, the many years of failure by management, despite many unions' demands to modernize, has left flight attendants fatigued, stranded, hungry and cold – on Christmas!

     Summary: Southwest Airlines canceled more than 70% of its flights on Monday, and warned mass disruptions will continue this week, drawing concern from the U.S. Department of Transportation, as other airlines recovered from severe winter weather.
Southwest Airlines had outsize struggles.
Delta Air Lines , American Airlines , United Airlines , JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines were among the carriers affected by the weather.
More than half of U.S.-based airlines' flights arrived late from Thursday through Saturday, with delays averaging 81 minutes, according to FlightAware.
JetBlue, meantime, offered flight attendants triple pay to pick up trips on Christmas Eve due to staffing shortages.
