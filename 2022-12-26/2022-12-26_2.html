    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Indianapolis Colts (4-9-1) will host the Los Angeles Chargers (8-6) on Monday night at Lucas Oil Stadium for their final prime-time game of the season.
While the Colts have lost four in a row and seven of their last eight games, the Chargers can clinch a playoff berth with a win.
The Colts donâ€™t have much to play for outside of playing spoiler, and the main focus now has shifted to their potential to be a team with a top-five pick.
With the Chargers as favorites in this game in the eyes of Vegas and the experts around the league, hereâ€™s how the Colts Wire staff sees this game shaking out:

     Chargers-Colts Game Day Updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Derwin James, Jr., Keenan Allen and Sebastian Joseph-Day were the Chargers captains.
The Chargers won the toss and elected to defer.
The Bolts began on defense and started hot by forcing a three-and-out to open the game, and DeAndre Carter's 16-yard punt return set the offense up at the 34-yard line.
But the offense also went three-and-out as the run game was stuffed on a 3rd-and-1 attempt to force a punt.
James, who missed the past two games, nabbed an interception of his own with an acrobatic leaping grab to make it three straight possessions with a turnover.
