     Liverpool Cody Gakpo transfer: Netherlands and PSV winger set to join Jurgen Klopp's attacking corps
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cody Gakpo was one of the stars of the World Cup scoring three goals for the Netherlands and he could be closing in on a move to Liverpool.
The Athletic adds that the initial fee could be around $44.6 million with there likely being add-ons in the deal as well.
They also add that Liverpool are confident in reaching an agreement with PSV.
Gakpo won't be able to be registered until the transfer window opens on January 1 if a deal goes through now.
But, with talks slated to begin between the two sides later this month according to CBS Sports soccer insider Fabrizio Romano, it looks like Liverpool have swooped in ahead of their rivals.

     What Liverpool can expect from Cody Gakpo: ‘He has always loved scoring or making assists’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been updated to reflect Cody Gakpo’s performances for the Netherlands at the World Cup and that Liverpool have reached an agreement to sign him.
In Qatar, Gakpo became the first Dutch player to score in all three group stage matches at a World Cup.
Manchester United had Gakpo on their list of possibilities during the summer and Leeds United and Southampton tried hard to make him theirs late on.
Those looking for a comparison may find his current style is somewhere between the Jadon Sancho who dazzled at Borussia Dortmund and Marcus Rashford during his best spells for Manchester United.
