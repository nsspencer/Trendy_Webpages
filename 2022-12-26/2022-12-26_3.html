     Summary: Southwest cancels more than 2,800 flights in a 'full-blown meltdown'Enlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesA historic winter storm has tangled holiday travel and brought dangerous conditions to a big chunk of the United States, but no airline has struggled more to navigate the Christmas holiday rush than Southwest Airlines.
Southwest canceled more than 2,870 flights by 8:25 p.m.
The number of canceled flights for Southwest is more than 10 times higher than for Delta, which had the second-most cancelations by a U.S. airline with 265 flights called off.
"This is really as bad as it gets for an airline," Potter said.
To have extensive cancellations continue on Monday, Potter said, "is a clear, clear sign something has gone horribly wrong."

     Southwest Airlines Creates Chaos Across America: Travel Meltdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Litvak was just one of hundreds of thousands of Americans whose travel plans have been destroyed during a meltdown of epic proportions as Southwest Airlines has canceled thousands of flights across the country.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA - DECEMBER 26: Passengers lined up by the Southwest Airlines counter at San ... [+] Francisco International Airport (SFO) in San Francisco, California, United States on December 26, 2022 as Southwest cancels more than 2,800 U.S. flights on Monday amid fierce winter storms.
Southwest Airlines’ woes began after extreme winter weather paralyzed much of the United States starting late last week, stranding holiday travelers and creating a ripple effect of chaos at airports across the country.
Other airlines have also had issues, but Southwest’s problems have been cataclysmic—with the airline canceling 10 times as many flights as other carriers.
“The way Southwest Airlines has treated its flight crews can only be termed ‘despicable,’” Lyn Montgomery, the president of Southwest’s flight attendant union, told CNN.

     Summary: Southwest Airlines had outsize struggles.
Delta Air Lines , American Airlines , United Airlines , JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines were among the carriers affected by the weather.
Some pilots and flight attendants were forced to sleep at airports because they were unable to find hotel rooms, their unions said.
More than half of U.S.-based airlines' flights arrived late from Thursday through Saturday, with delays averaging 81 minutes, according to FlightAware.
JetBlue, meantime, offered flight attendants triple pay to pick up trips on Christmas Eve due to staffing shortages.
