     Arsenal comeback opens up seven-point Premier League lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eddie Nketiah scored as Arsenal opened up a seven-point lead at the top of the Premier LeagueLondon (AFP) – Arsenal opened up a seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League after coming from behind to beat West Ham 3-1 at the Emirates on Monday.
Advertising Read moreBukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli turned the game around in the space of five second half minutes before Eddie Nketiah stepped up in the absence of Gabriel Jesus to seal all three points.
Arsenal's momentum towards a first league title since 2004 could have been halted by a six-week break for the World Cup.
But Nketiah grabbed his opportunity on his first Premier League start of the season with a brilliant spin and low finish into the far corner from Odegaard's pass 21 minutes from time.
However, another show of resilience from Arsenal showed the fight that lies ahead of the defending champions if they are to retain the title once more in the second half of the season.

     Premier League leaders Arsenal face West Ham as EPL resumes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta faces a challenge that dwarfs the achievement of the club’s surge to the top of the Premier League table in the pre-World Cup portion of the campaign: How to keep the improbable run going?
The Gunners are hoping to pick up their league season where they left off six weeks ago when they welcome West Ham in the late Boxing Day fixture that will conclude a program of seven matches on Monday.
The Gunners are set to play six matches over the next 28 days and have a similarly busy schedule in February.
The Premier League resumes just eight days after Spurs duo Hugo Lloris and Cristian Romero battled it out in Qatar for the World Cup.
“It is a strange situation and honestly to play so quickly - only one week after the World Cup - I am not really happy,” he said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ahead of Gameweek 17, Mitrovic was a doubt for Fulham's trip to Crystal Palace with a foot problem, and was ditched from 957,000+ teams.
The Eagles talisman was dumped by over 795,000 following his second penalty miss of the campaign in Gameweek 16, and Zaha blanked in the defeat to Fulham.
Meanwhile, a knee injury for Gabriel Jesus (£8.0m) meant the Arsenal forward became the most-sold player ahead of Gameweek 17, shipped out by more than 2.2million managers.
The No 1 transfer target ahead of Gameweek 17, Toney followed up his brace against Manchester City in Gameweek 16 with a goal at home to Tottenham Hotspur.
It could make Salah a big Gameweek 17 differential after he got a goal and an assist in Liverpool's 3-1 win at Aston Villa.
