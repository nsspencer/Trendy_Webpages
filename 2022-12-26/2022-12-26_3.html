     Day after giving up 50 points to Rams, Broncos fire coach Nathaniel Hackett
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos have fired first-year head coach Nathaniel Hackett with two games left in the season.
Firing Hackett with two games left in a lost season allows Penner to begin his search for a replacement immediately.
AdvertisementThe Walton-Penner group purchased the Broncos for $4.65 billion last summer, a global record for a professional sports franchise.
On Sunday, the Broncos (4-11) were blown out by the equally downtrodden Rams 51-14 when Russell Wilson had three passes intercepted and was sacked six times.
The Broncos have missed the playoffs seven consecutive seasons and extended their string of losing records to six.

Despite Hackett’s experience as an offensive coordinator, he was ineffective at jumpstarting the Broncos offense.
In his lone season in Denver, Hackett had some clock management and game management issues as well as an underperforming offense.
In August, the Broncos organization formally introduced their new ownership group led by Rob Walton and the Walton-Penner Family.

     Summary: ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- The Denver Broncos fired first-year head coach Nathaniel Hackett on Monday.
Hackett's dismissal puts an abrupt end to the shortest tenure of any noninterim head coach in franchise history.
"This change was made now out of respect for everyone involved and allows us to immediately begin the search for a new head coach.
Hackett, 42, was hired in January as the franchise's 18th head coach after serving three seasons as the Green Bay Packers' offensive coordinator under Matt LaFleur.
The disconnect between Hackett, Wilson and the offense persisted, however.
