     Steam Replay gives you an overview of your 2022 gaming habits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steam Replay is Valve's new highlight page going over a bunch of fun stats about your gaming year, something made popular by the likes of Spotify Wrapped and similar events from numerous other places.
It's actually quite a fun bit of info and you can set your own page public to send it to others too.
Steam Replay takes data between January 1st and December 14th 2022, and does not include any offline mode play, which explains why some of mine are a lot lower than I expected.
I put myself in offline mode a lot, otherwise I end up getting spammed with messages a bit too much about new games.
You even get a nice collage of all the games you played too.
