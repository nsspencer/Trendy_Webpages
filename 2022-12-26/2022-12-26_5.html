     Southwest Airlines Releases Statement as Flight Cancellations Pile Up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Southwest Airlines blamed the "lingering effects" of a winter storm and scheduling problems for the reason hundreds of customers' flights were canceled during the post-holiday travel rush.
Southwest said it anticipates "additional changes with an already reduced level of flights as we approach the coming New Year holiday travel period."
Dozens of other cancellations were also reported at O'Hare International Airport, making for more than 200 flights canceled across Chicago during the post-holiday rush.
The cancellations come after a winter storm wreaked havoc on holiday travel plans last week.
The deep freeze from a deadly winter storm that walloped much of the United States continued in parts of the Northeast Monday.
