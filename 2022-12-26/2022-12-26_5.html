     Nuggets' Aaron Gordon drops jokes after Dunk of the Year vs. Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Rexwell Villas · 2 min readAaron Gordon submitted a late but strong entry for Dunk of the Year 2022 Sunday night when he put Landry Shamet on a poster.
DUNK OF THE YEAR pic.twitter.com/dUml31nzOf — Denver Nuggets (@nuggets) December 26, 2022Apparently, after all the work he did in the game, Gordon still got enough energy to muster a joke following the Nuggets’ 128-125 home win over Chris Paul and company, per T.J. McBride of Denver Stiffs.
Gordon’s dunk deserved more than a 50 if you ask Nuggets fans.
With that basket, Gordon managed to expand Denver’s breathing room on the scoreboard late in overtime, but not before the dunk getting reviewed by the game officials.
Against the Suns, Jokic recorded 41 points, 15 rebounds, and 15 assists in 44 minutes.

     Aaron Gordon dunk: Watch Nuggets forward unleash season's best slam in crucial moment during Christmas win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here's a fun fact: Aaron Gordon wears the number 50 because of the many, many times he's achieved that score in the Slam Dunk Contest.
Here's a less fun fact: he's never actually won the Slam Dunk Contest despite racking up the most 50-point dunks in its history (eight).
Here's the most fun fact of the night: on Sunday, Gordon unleashed a dunk more fearsome than anything ever scored by the judges.
Let's set the scene: it's overtime in a critical Western Conference showdown between the Denver Nuggets and Phoenix Suns on Christmas night.
Gordon may never get the Slam Dunk Contest trophy he craves, but this dunk alone more than justifies his uniform number.

     Aaron Gordon had perhaps the best dunk of the season during the Nuggets' overtime win on Christmas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gordon has thrown down 85 dunks so far this season, which ranks as the second-best in the NBA behind only Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo.
That was the second-highest total of his career and tied for the most on record in an NBA game played on Christmas.
Gordon sprinted the ball up the court in transition before he eventually took off from an impossibly far distance.
The officials originally called a charge on Gordon but reversed the call and Denver increased its one-point lead to three.
Gordon, meanwhile, is enjoying what is arguably the best campaign of his professional career thus far.

     Nuggets’ Nikola Jokic on Aaron Gordon: “He’s the soul of the team.”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jamal Murray deemed it the “dunk of the year.”Outside of Gordon, Nikola Jokic had the best vantage point for the thunderous, soul-snatching jam over Landry Shamet late Sunday night.
Up 124-123 with 24 seconds left, Gordon corralled his 12th rebound of the night and picked up steam on the opposite side of the floor.
The soaring dunk, Gordon’s seventh of the night, elicited a roar from Ball Arena that rivaled the decibels of a playoff game.
“He’s the soul of this team, if that makes any sense,” said Jokic, the two-time reigning MVP.
Late Sunday night, as Gordon was in the middle of addressing reporters, Jokic walked into the postgame news conference and told him his time was up.

     Watch Aaron Gordon throw down Dunk of the Year over Shamet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown combined to score 70 and a Celtics team that had looked a little bored the past couple of weeks came in focused and dominated.
Even without Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia went into Madison Square Garden and beat the red-hot Knicks in the early game on Christmas, 119-112.
pic.twitter.com/fvnXByBpPw — NBA (@NBA) December 25, 2022Philly has won eight in a row and maybe they can make it a big three in the East by the time we get to the playoffs.
Or maybe the team to beat in the West is the team that closed Christmas Day with a dramatic win….
And the biggest highlight was Aaron Gordon throwing down the hammer on the Suns’ Landry Shamet in overtime.
