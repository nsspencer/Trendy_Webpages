“I need to help get the team in a better rhythm with some of the play calls,” offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said.
“At times, you’re looking for a big play — and maybe too aggressive at times, maybe not aggressive other times.
The Colts have had difficulty stopping opponents in the red zone, their 32.5% success rate ranking 30th.
The Chargers have struggled at times in the red zone but were two for two last weekend against Tennessee, running the ball on all eight plays they had inside the 20-yard line.

     Colts Team Owner Jim Irsay Issues GM Chris Ballard a Vote of Confidence for 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The franchise had an offseason change at starting quarterback and the additions of other key veterans—which was expected to bring much needed consistency and leadership.
Further, this roster is more than a high level quarterback away right now (although some improvements at a few key positions would certainly help right the ship in otherwise stormy waters).
It’s an offense that has struggled to consistently score points in the high teens, which has caused them to lose a lot of games.
It’s the second time that Irsay has issued a vote of confidence to Ballard during this rocky season—which has seen changes at head coach and offensive coordinator already.
If Ballard can make some adjustments to his arguably archaic approach, he has the chance to return to being regarded as one of the league’s best general managers again.

When the season began, the Giants were lightly regarded by the football public and media.
