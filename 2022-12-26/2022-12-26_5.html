     Summary: “We have a newer generation that doesn’t know much about Kwanzaa,” Jackson said as she hurried to get ready for her guests.
“I think you see people will post something on social media — ‘Happy Kwanzaa,’” Jackson said.
Last year, her partner told her he “didn’t know anything about Kwanzaa,” Jackson said.
Eight friends came, but Jackson realized African American community members knew little about the event because of a lack of meaningful celebrations.
The next year, she decided to hold a community event on the first day of Kwanzaa.

     San Diego celebrates the beginning of Kwanzaa

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The middle candle represents Umoja, or unity, and is traditionally lit on the first night of Kwanzaa, as it was Monday at the WorldBeat Cultural Center in Balboa Park.
Founded in 1966 by California State University Long Beach professor Maulana Karenga, Kwanzaa began as an African American cultural celebration.
Kwanzaa is not a religious holiday, but rather a cultural one — not unlike St. Patrick’s Day, explained Starla Lewis, professor emeritus at San Diego Mesa College.
The first day of Kwanzaa celebrates Umoja, or unity.
“This year’s Kwanzaa theme self-consciously focuses on the foundational right and practice of freedom,” Karenga wrote.
