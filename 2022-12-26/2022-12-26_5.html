     Southwest Air Faces Gridlock With Over 80% of Flights Scrapped or Late
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Southwest Airlines Co. canceled almost 3,000 flights and had hundreds of others run late, disrupting more than 80% of its schedule as operational woes mushroomed in the wake of the massive winter storm that pummeled the US.
The trips wiped off the books Monday meant that Southwest was responsible for almost three-fourths of cancellations in the US.
That made the biggest discount carrier an unhappy outlier in the US industry, where recovery was the watchword after a holiday weekend of travel tie-ups.

     Southwest cancels 60% of flights while air travel disruptions ease elsewhere after storms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Southwest Airlines canceled more than 60% of its flights on Monday, while flight disruptions stemming from severe winter weather eased at other carriers.
Southwest Airlines had outsize struggles.
Delta Air Lines , American Airlines , United Airlines , JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines were among the carriers affected by the weather.
More than half of U.S.-based airlines' flights arrived late from Thursday through Saturday, with delays averaging 81 minutes, according to FlightAware.
JetBlue, meantime, offered flight attendants triple pay to pick up trips on Christmas Eve due to staffing shortages.

     Southwest Airlines Releases Statement as Flight Cancellations Pile Up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Southwest Airlines blamed the "lingering effects" of a winter storm and scheduling problems for the reason hundreds of customers' flights were canceled during the post-holiday travel rush.
Southwest said it anticipates "additional changes with an already reduced level of flights as we approach the coming New Year holiday travel period."
Dozens of other cancellations were also reported at O'Hare International Airport, making for more than 200 flights canceled across Chicago during the post-holiday rush.
The cancellations come after a winter storm wreaked havoc on holiday travel plans last week.
The deep freeze from a deadly winter storm that walloped much of the United States continued in parts of the Northeast Monday.

     Southwest cancels more than 2,800 flights in a 'full-blown meltdown'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A historic winter storm has tangled holiday travel and brought dangerous conditions to a big chunk of the United States, but no airline has struggled more to navigate the Christmas holiday rush than Southwest Airlines.
Southwest canceled more than 2,800 flights by 6:55 p.m.
The number of canceled flights for Southwest is more than 10 times higher than for Delta, which had the second-most cancelations by a U.S. airline with 265 flights called off.
"This is really as bad as it gets for an airline," Potter said.
To have extensive cancellations continue on Monday, Potter said, "is a clear, clear sign something has gone horribly wrong."
