     What is Boxing Day and How Did the Holiday Get Its Name?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But, what exactly is Boxing Day?
Boxing Day originsBoxing Day is a centuries-old gift-giving day that originated in Britain.
Boxing Day in IrelandAccording to Almanac.com, Boxing Day in Ireland is also known as St. Stephen's Day after the saint who was a missionary in Sweden and had a fondness for animals -- in particular horses.
Boxing Day todayBy the 21st century, Boxing Day closely resembles "Black Friday" since the day has now become associated with shopping and sporting events, namely those involving horses (see above for 'Boxing Day in Ireland'), according to Almanac.com.
Charity and giving to those in need is still a big part of Boxing Day.

     UK retailers see 50% rise in Boxing Day shoppers over last year’s figures
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The number of shoppers hitting the Boxing Day sales has bounced back after last year’s Covid-hit Christmas – but remained well below levels seen before the pandemic.
The shopper tracking agency Springboard said there had been a 50% rise in shopper numbers out on Monday compared with Boxing Day last year, when the Omicron variant of Covid-19 prompted many to stay at home.
She said that the bounceback from last year was likely to have been assisted by Boxing Day falling on a Monday compared with a Sunday last year, when a number of large chains chose to remain closed while others reduced trading hours.
“Footfall has undoubtedly been helped by the calm and sunny weather, which will have encouraged consumers to make trips out.
The expected fall in Boxing Day trade compared with last year continues a long decline in popularity of the annual shopping tradition, as the rise of the US-inspired November discount day Black Friday and the move towards starting end-of-year sales before Christmas Day have combined to steal its thunder.

     Cameroon Uses ‘Boxing Day’ to Aid Children Displaced by Separatist Conflict
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cameroon is marking Boxing Day, the day after Christmas when gifts are traditionally given to the poor, with a nationwide gift drive for internally displaced children.
Cameroon's government, churches and aid groups are working together to provide food, books, and school fees to tens of thousands of children displaced by the country's separatist conflict.
More than 300 children displaced by Cameroon’s separatist conflict gathered Monday at the Bandjoun Community Hall in the capital Yaounde to receive Boxing Day gifts.
While many churches and aid groups on Boxing Day support IDP children with gifts, including one time by first lady Chantal Biya, this year’s was the first to be coordinated nationwide.
Authorities say the Boxing Day gift drive aims to ease suffering for tens of thousands of children displaced by the separatist conflict, now in its fifth year.
