     Summary: Ahead of Gameweek 17, Mitrovic was a doubt for Fulham's trip to Crystal Palace with a foot problem, and was ditched from 957,000+ teams.
Meanwhile, a knee injury for Gabriel Jesus (£8.0m) meant the Arsenal forward became the most-sold player ahead of Gameweek 17, shipped out by more than 2.2million managers.
The No 1 transfer target ahead of Gameweek 17, Toney followed up his brace against Manchester City in Gameweek 16 with a goal at home to Tottenham Hotspur.

     Premier League leaders Arsenal face West Ham as EPL resumes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta faces a challenge that dwarfs the achievement of the club’s surge to the top of the Premier League table in the pre-World Cup portion of the campaign: How to keep the improbable run going?
The Gunners are hoping to pick up their league season where they left off six weeks ago when they welcome West Ham in the late Boxing Day fixture that will conclude a program of seven matches on Monday.
The Gunners are set to play six matches over the next 28 days and have a similarly busy schedule in February.
The Premier League resumes just eight days after Spurs duo Hugo Lloris and Cristian Romero battled it out in Qatar for the World Cup.
“It is a strange situation and honestly to play so quickly - only one week after the World Cup - I am not really happy,” he said.

     Soccer-Arsenal stretch lead to seven points as Premier League returns, Newcastle go second
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Richard MartinLONDON, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Arsenal came from a goal down to beat West Ham United 3-1 and extend their Premier League lead to seven points as the top-flight season resumed on Monday.
Earlier in the Boxing Day programme Newcastle United stormed into second placeby outclassing Leicester City 3-0 away for their sixth successive Premier League win.
After a 44-day interruption caused by the World Cup, the Premier League resumed with many players back from international duty and Arsenal continued exactly where they had left off.
They have 40 points from 15 games, seven clear of Newcastle who have played a game more.
Defender van Dijk bagged Liverpool's second in the 37th minute with a superb left-footed shot after being set up by Salah.
