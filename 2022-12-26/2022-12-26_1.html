     Premier League leaders Arsenal face West Ham as EPL resumes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta faces a challenge that dwarfs the achievement of the club’s surge to the top of the Premier League table in the pre-World Cup portion of the campaign: How to keep the improbable run going?
The Gunners are hoping to pick up their league season where they left off six weeks ago when they welcome West Ham in the late Boxing Day fixture that will conclude a program of seven matches on Monday.
The Gunners are set to play six matches over the next 28 days and have a similarly busy schedule in February.
The Premier League resumes just eight days after Spurs duo Hugo Lloris and Cristian Romero battled it out in Qatar for the World Cup.
“It is a strange situation and honestly to play so quickly - only one week after the World Cup - I am not really happy,” he said.

     Arsenal rally to beat West Ham as Wenger watches on

     Summary: Benrahma sent Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale the wrong way from the spot to put West Ham in front in the 27th minute after a foul by William Saliba on Jarrod Bowen.
Saka equalised from close range in the 53rd minute while Martinelli smashed the ball inside the near post six minutes later to put Arsenal in front.
The Norwegian split the visiting defence with a low pass to the feet of Saka, who had time to calmly pick his spot and beat former Arsenal 'keeper Lukasz Fabianski.
Now level, Arsenal did not take long to take the lead, Granit Xhaka slipping a pass towards Martinelli, whose powerful strike flummoxed Fabianski.
We didn't start to play the game they wanted to play, we kept pushing, believing and deserved the win."

     Liverpool close gap on Premier League top four with win at Aston Villa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool secured a big win (David Davies/PA) (PA Wire)Liverpool held off Aston Villa’s plucky challenge to close the gap on the Premier League’s top four.
Victory moved them five points adrift of the Champions League spots, remaining sixth, ahead of Friday’s visit of Leicester.
If the stoppage unsettled Villa, it failed to deter the visitors who took the lead once play resumed on five minutes.
Liverpool hardly looked secure at the back and Leon Bailey miscued from 12 yards as Villa Park’s usual frustration raised its head early.
Liverpool, though, should have killed the game after 50 minutes when Salah broke quickly from a Villa free-kick only for Olsen to deny him.
