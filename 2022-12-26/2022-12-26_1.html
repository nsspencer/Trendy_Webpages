"For far too long people have talked about the talent of this football team and the organization and that's ultimately not what gets you where you want to go.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Chargers defense has transformed from a liability to an advantage as Brandon Staley's team clinched a playoff berth with a stifling 20-3 victory over the Indianapolis Colts Monday night.
The Chargers allowed a Nick Foles-led Colts offense to generate a measly 173 total yards, 10 first downs, and held Indy to 0-10 on third down and 1-4 on fourth down while earning three interceptions.
The Chargers' defense sacked Foles seven times -- most in a game since Week 16, 2016 -- and picked the QB off three times.
The last time the Chargers allowed three or fewer points and under 200 total yards was Week 5, 2014, versus the New York Jets (0 points and 151 total yards allowed).
The Chargers have allowed 11.3 points per game and 225.3 total yards per game since Week 14, both tops in the NFL during that span.

    </h2>

     Summary: The Chargers got Derwin James back on Monday night, welcoming their star safety to the secondary after a two-game absence due to injury.
James' return was short-lived, however, after the veteran defensive back was ejected for leading with his helmet on a hard second-quarter hit in Week 16's matchup with the Colts.
James, meanwhile, visited the Chargers' blue medical tent after getting flagged for unnecessary roughness; officials quickly announced he'd also been disqualified for the hit.
The hit, which came two plays after James was penalized for a face mask on Michael Pittman Jr., appeared to affect the Chargers safety even more than Dulin, at least immediately afterward.
James missed the Chargers' previous two games with a quad injury.
