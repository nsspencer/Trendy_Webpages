     Premier League leaders Arsenal face West Ham as EPL resumes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta faces a challenge that dwarfs the achievement of the club’s surge to the top of the Premier League table in the pre-World Cup portion of the campaign: How to keep the improbable run going?
The Gunners are hoping to pick up their league season where they left off six weeks ago when they welcome West Ham in the late Boxing Day fixture that will conclude a program of seven matches on Monday.
The Gunners are set to play six matches over the next 28 days and have a similarly busy schedule in February.
The Premier League resumes just eight days after Spurs duo Hugo Lloris and Cristian Romero battled it out in Qatar for the World Cup.
“It is a strange situation and honestly to play so quickly - only one week after the World Cup - I am not really happy,” he said.

     Liverpool close gap on Premier League top four with win at Aston Villa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool secured a big win (David Davies/PA) (PA Wire)Liverpool held off Aston Villa’s plucky challenge to close the gap on the Premier League’s top four.
Victory moved them five points adrift of the Champions League spots, remaining sixth, ahead of Friday’s visit of Leicester.
If the stoppage unsettled Villa, it failed to deter the visitors who took the lead once play resumed on five minutes.
Liverpool hardly looked secure at the back and Leon Bailey miscued from 12 yards as Villa Park’s usual frustration raised its head early.
Liverpool, though, should have killed the game after 50 minutes when Salah broke quickly from a Villa free-kick only for Olsen to deny him.

     Conte hails Spurs 'character' as Premier League returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Antonio Conte hailed Tottenham's "big character" as they staged a thrilling fightback to draw 2-2 at Brentford as the Premier League returned in style on Monday after the World Cup break.
In the first Premier League fixture since mid-November, Conte's side were in danger of a damaging defeat after Vitaly Janelt and Ivan Toney put Brentford in command at the Community Stadium.
Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris was rested following France's World Cup final loss, so Fraser Forster started in goal.
Forster's Tottenham league debut got off to a rocky start as he weakly pushed Mathias Jensen's volley straight to German midfielder Janelt, who bundled home from close-range.
It was Kane's 196th Premier League goal but his first against Brentford which means he has now scored against all 32 teams he has played against in the league.
