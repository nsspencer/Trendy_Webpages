     Premier League leaders Arsenal face West Ham as EPL resumes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta faces a challenge that dwarfs the achievement of the club’s surge to the top of the Premier League table in the pre-World Cup portion of the campaign: How to keep the improbable run going?
The Gunners are hoping to pick up their league season where they left off six weeks ago when they welcome West Ham in the late Boxing Day fixture that will conclude a program of seven matches on Monday.
The Gunners are set to play six matches over the next 28 days and have a similarly busy schedule in February.
The Premier League resumes just eight days after Spurs duo Hugo Lloris and Cristian Romero battled it out in Qatar for the World Cup.
“It is a strange situation and honestly to play so quickly - only one week after the World Cup - I am not really happy,” he said.

     Conte hails Spurs 'character' as Premier League returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Antonio Conte hailed Tottenham's "big character" as they staged a thrilling fightback to draw 2-2 at Brentford as the Premier League returned in style on Monday after the World Cup break.
In the first Premier League fixture since mid-November, Conte's side were in danger of a damaging defeat after Vitaly Janelt and Ivan Toney put Brentford in command at the Community Stadium.
Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris was rested following France's World Cup final loss, so Fraser Forster started in goal.
Forster's Tottenham league debut got off to a rocky start as he weakly pushed Mathias Jensen's volley straight to German midfielder Janelt, who bundled home from close-range.
It was Kane's 196th Premier League goal but his first against Brentford which means he has now scored against all 32 teams he has played against in the league.

     Newcastle brush Leicester aside to move second with sixth straight Premier League win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joelinton celebrates scoring Newcastle’s third goal at Leicester (Getty Images)Newcastle United showed they can be part of the Premier League title race, moving second in the table with a 3-0 win at Leicester.
It may be 45 days since their last one, but this was a sixth Premier League win in a row - their best run since 2012 - as Howe’s side proved that an outstanding first half of the season was not a flash in the pan.
Brendan Rodgers would have not envisaged his side being two down after only seven minutes, with Newcastle electric from the start.
After being set free down the right by Kieran Tripper, he cut inside, played a delightful one-two with Bruno Guimaraes and coolly slotted past Danny Ward for his eighth goal in nine Premier League games.
The work had been done, though, meaning Newcastle have suffered just one defeat in their opening 16 games.
