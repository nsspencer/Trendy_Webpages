     Aaron Gordon had perhaps the best dunk of the season during the Nuggets' overtime win on Christmas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gordon has thrown down 85 dunks so far this season, which ranks as the second-best in the NBA behind only Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo.
That was the second-highest total of his career and tied for the most on record in an NBA game played on Christmas.
Gordon sprinted the ball up the court in transition before he eventually took off from an impossibly far distance.
The officials originally called a charge on Gordon but reversed the call and Denver increased its one-point lead to three.
Gordon, meanwhile, is enjoying what is arguably the best campaign of his professional career thus far.

     Aaron Gordon dunk: Watch Nuggets forward unleash season's best slam in crucial moment during Christmas win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here's a fun fact: Aaron Gordon wears the number 50 because of the many, many times he's achieved that score in the NBA's Slam Dunk Contest.
Here's a less fun fact: he's never actually won the Slam Dunk Contest despite racking up the most 50-point dunks in its history (eight).
Here's the most fun fact of the night: on Sunday, Gordon unleashed a dunk more fearsome than anything ever scored by the judges.
Let's set the scene: it's overtime in a critical Western Conference showdown between the Denver Nuggets and Phoenix Suns on Christmas night.
Gordon may never get the Slam Dunk Contest trophy he craves, but this dunk alone more than justifies his uniform number.

     True Basketball Crime: Aaron Gordon hit-and-run dunk over Landry Shamet shattered the Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christmas Day 2022 will always be remembered for how we nearly lost Landry Shamet to a senseless posterization.
However, before Shamet arrived at his fateful encounter, the Suns led 113-111 with 15 seconds remaining and needed a stop.
AdvertisementHowever, Murray’s dunk wasn’t nearly as injurious to Phoenix as the detonation Aaron Gordon activated in the atmosphere above the tin.
AdvertisementWe won’t know how much of Shamet spiritually or physically was left on Denver’s Ball Arena floor until the Suns step on it again on Tuesday.
Jokić had a 41-point triple-double blotted out by Gordon’s slam over Shamet, but he appears to be en route to his third-consecutive MVP trophy.

EVERY ANGLE OF AARON GORDON'S RIDICULOUS DUNK OF THE YEAR CANDIDATE 🎬🤯 pic.twitter.com/bFEzWMvRHD — NBA (@NBA) December 26, 2022That's when Gordon, the Denver forward, grabbed the rebound and sped down the court.
He kept sailing forward, even as he made contact with Shamet, and shoved the basketball into the net.
Gordon says it's the best in-game dunk he's ever had "because of the time and score."

     Nuggets’ Nikola Jokic on Aaron Gordon: “He’s the soul of the team.”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The soaring dunk, Gordon’s seventh of the night, elicited a roar from Ball Arena that rivaled the decibels of a playoff game.
According to Jokic, arguably the smartest player in the NBA right now, he has.
“He’s the soul of this team, if that makes any sense,” said Jokic, the two-time reigning MVP.
Late Sunday night, as Gordon was in the middle of addressing reporters, Jokic walked into the postgame news conference and told him his time was up.
Everything Gordon needed to say, about his dunk, his dominance, and Denver’s burgeoning championship potential, had already been said.
