     Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan admit the Chicago Bulls underestimated the Houston Rockets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Instead of extending their win streak to four games, the Bulls fell to one of the worst teams in the NBA.
Just as it seemed that the Chicago Bulls found some consistency, they fell to the worst-seeded team in the Western Conference.
However, the Houston Rockets' huge third-quarter run secured them a 133-118 win that snapped Chicago's three-game winning streak and dropped their record to 14-19.
“That’s unacceptable,” DeMar DeRozan said of the Bulls' slow start to the game.
It's also something that, according to LaVine and DeRozan, cost them the win last night.

     Bulls lose sense of urgency, 3-game win streak in defensive collapse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You know it’s a bad night when the one constant you could count on in this most inconsistent of Bulls’ seasons goes by the wayside.
The Chicago Bulls entered Monday’s home game against the Houston Rockets with an 8-0 record in games they had led at halftime.
"We can’t just expect to win because it’s the Rockets and it’s a bunch of young guys over there," he said.
Coach Billy Donovan hinted pregame at his defensive concerns, saying that the Bulls can’t be a team that excels on one side of the ball.
Now, that script has flipped, which seems fitting for such an inconsistent team.

     Summary: CHICAGO — No longer should the Bulls’ trio of stars be referred to as a “Big Three.”DeMar DeRozan, Zach LaVine and Nikola Vučević have proved to be wholly unworthy.
The Timberwolves took it to the Bulls, scoring an opponent’s season-high 150 points while playing without stars Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert.
Chicago fell to 3-8 against teams below .500, the Bulls once again putting on display their season-long penchant for inexplicable inconsistency.
“At this point, I don’t think it’s surprising,” Bulls forward Patrick Williams said.
They cut and passed with precision, generated fouls when Bulls defenders couldn’t contain them and splashed in cold-blooded shots.

     Summary: Unfortunately for the Bulls, it was the Rockets who were enjoying themselves, and they continued to have fun for four quarters.
The Bulls struggled to keep up.
“We have to find ways to sustain, have the stamina to do it night after night after night,” Donovan said.
The Rockets have the worst field-goal percentage in the league at 44.3% but shot 55.6% against the Bulls.
The lowly Rockets made a mockery of the Bulls on their home court, dropping them to 14-19 on the season.
