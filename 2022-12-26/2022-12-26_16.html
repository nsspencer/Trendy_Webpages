     LA Clippers vs Detroit Pistons Injury Report Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The LA Clippers are looking to have a much-needed bounceback win against the Detroit Pistons, but they'll need to do it without the help of Kawhi Leonard.
Meaning, he'll likely play tomorrow against the Toronto Raptors instead.
The other players on the injury report are all in the G League: Brandon Boston (assignment), Moussa Diabate (two-way), and Jason Preston (assignment).
Cade Cunningham is out with a left tibia stress fracture, Isaiah Livers is out with a right shoulder sprain, Key Braxton is out on a G League two-way, and Buddy Boeheim is out on a G League two-way.
The very next game has the Toronto Raptors lined up, so it's imperative to take advantage of the easier games for LA.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Pistons face the Los Angeles Clippers for the second time this season, and Detroit is hoping for a better result than the first matchup.
The Pistons were able to hold the Clippers to under 100 points, something that has only happened one other time this season.
However, an all-too-familiar third-quarter collapse with the Clippers besting the Pistons 26-17 led to a 96-91 defeat.
One player missing for Detroit in that game, Isaiah Stewart, will be available tonight, and rebounding was a particular pain point in the first game.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Clippers bench came back to tie the game, and then the Clippers starters finished the job.
Nothing more than a young team going through a rebuild.
If there is one silver lining, the Pistons did not choke the game in the third quarter this time.
If the Pistons won this game, I would be writing about how balanced the scoring attack was with eight players scoring in double digits.
It is clear that the Pistons young players are getting more comfortable game by game.

     Summary: The Clippers have had a few days off, and now get a bad Pistons team on the road before the end of December schedule gets very tough.
Still, the Pistons’ awful defense is a good game for the Clippers to boost their stats a bit.
NotesNo Kawhi, Yes Wall: John Wall is back after a game off, while Kawhi Leonard is out for tonight on the first of a back-to-back.
The Clippers clearly (and rightly) hope that they can beat the Pistons without Kawhi’s services, but will need him against the wing-heavy Raptors.
Nico Scorching: The Clippers’ offense has been buoyed by some renewed offense from superstar role player Nic Batum.

The Clippers led by five at the half and expanded the margin to 88-73 midway through the third quarter.

     Clippers vs. Pistons Recap: The Worst Win of the Year • 213hoops.com
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Clippers beat the Pistons 142-131 in overtime on the road to secure a win in one of the worst and most embarrassing basketball games I’ve ever seen.
Unfortunately, in a first-half theme, the Clippers were unable to get any separation because the Pistons kept making threes.
The Pistons cut into the lead, and then, somehow, took the lead during a four-minute Clippers’ scoring drought.
On a completely broken play, Terance made a midrange jumper to tie it up with five seconds left.
When the Clippers play three of these guys together, much less four, they’re asking for defensive breakdowns, no rim protection, and poor rebounding.
