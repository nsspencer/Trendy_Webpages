     Kevin Durant admits that even he does not understand the NBA's new transition take foul rule
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NBA’s rulebook is constantly evolving, and one of the biggest changes this season is the addition of a rule against the transition take foul.
Transition scoring is up from 112.3 points per 100 possessions last season to 113.5 points per 100 possessions this season, per Cleaning the Glass.
That means each team may get called for a transition take foul around 8 times per season.
The take foul still confuses me — Kevin Durant (@KDTrey5) December 26, 2022Brooklyn’s Kevin Durant has not yet committed a transition take foul — but he has drawn one.
He tweeted that the foul rule is still confusing to him, too, even though he is a two-time NBA Finals MVP.
