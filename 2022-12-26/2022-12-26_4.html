     Everton vs Wolverhampton Wanderers LIVE: Premier League result, final score and reaction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Getty Images)Rayan Ait Nouri grabbed the winner five minutes into stoppage-time as Wolverhampton Wanderers moved off the foot of the table with a 2-1 victory over Everton in manager Julen Lopetegui’s first Premier League game in charge on Monday.
Wolves climbed two places to 18th with 13 points from 16 games, one place and one point behind Everton, who are now in freefall following a six-week break in the Premier League season for the World Cup.
Everton hit the front inside seven minutes with their first goal from a corner all season.
Dwight McNeil swung in the set-piece and an unmarked Yerry Mina headed in his first Premier League goal for two years.
Ait Nouri’s late winner came against the run of play as the home side pushed for victory, but Wolves host Manchester United and Everton travel to Manchester City in their next games on Saturday.

     The Opposition View: Everton vs Wolves | Blues look to unwrap three points on Boxing Day return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The team will need better offensive cohesion and efficacy, because if goals remain at a premium for this side, the wins will also not come often.
RBM: What has gone awry for this club this season, as well as in recent seasons?
RBM: When Wolves are at their best and worst, how are they playing on the pitch?
At our worst we’ve looked lightweight at the back and toothless in attack.
Daniel Podence can be incredibly frustrating but he has quality and has hurt Everton in the past.
