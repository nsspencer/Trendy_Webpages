     Opinion: Kwanzaa is more than a holiday. It’s a reminder of who we are and what we’ve overcome.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mayasa, Ed.D., is chair of the Black Studies Department at San Diego Mesa College and lives in San Diego.
Kwanzaa — meaning “first fruits” in Kiswahili — is an African American and Pan-African holiday that is celebrated by millions of people throughout the African diaspora (Africans throughout the world).
It’s important to note that Kwanzaa is not a replacement for Christmas or a religious holiday.
As a celebration of family, community and culture, the spirit of Kwanzaa also represents a celebration of freedom and liberating consciousness.
It’s a reminder to African people of the diaspora of who we are and of what we’ve endured and overcome.
