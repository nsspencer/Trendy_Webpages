     Summary: Whoopi Goldberg is facing fresh scrutiny for remarks about the Holocaust after she previously drew backlash for claiming the genocide was not “about race.”In an interview with the Sunday Times published Saturday, “The View” co-host told the London-based newspaper that the Holocaust “wasn’t originally” based on race.
When Turner reiterated that “Nazis saw Jews as a race,” Goldberg replied: “Yes, but that’s the killer, isn’t it?
“Whoopi Goldberg – 1 million Jews were murdered in Auschwitz alone, so take a lesson from @AuschwitzMuseum,” Boundless Israel co-founder Aviva Klompas wrote on Twitter.
Goldberg, an Academy Award winner, was previously suspended by “The View” earlier this year after making similar comments about race and the Holocaust.
Goldberg said in apologizing earlier this year that her support for Jewish people would “never waiver.”“I’m sorry for the hurt I have caused,” Goldberg wrote then.
