     Jesus' replacement, January signings and tying down key players: Six questions Arsenal must answer after the World Cup break
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is the big question facing Arsenal as the Premier League returns.
Jesus may have only scored five goals for the Gunners before the break for the World Cup, but the overall impact he had on his new club was huge.
From his pressing ability to his clever movement in and around the penalty, Jesus completely transformed the way Mikel Arteta’s side attacked.
It looks certain that Arteta will initially turn to Eddie Nketiah to fill the void left by Jesus.
Those are all questions that all need to be answered positively if Arsenal are to continue setting the pace once the Premier League returns.

     Summary: Sign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inboxArsenal defender Oleksandr Zinchenko may have hinted at his involvement in the team ahead of his side's clash with West Ham on Boxing Day.
It would mark a huge boost to Mikel Arteta in his options available in the squad as they return to Premier League action after six-weeks away.
Unfortunately for Arteta, he has a few issues in his team coming back from the break, with a few injury issues throughout.
Arteta didn't explicitly say whether he would be involved though, telling reporters: "Alex is progressing well."
However, Zinchenko may have hinted at his involvement in the clash by dropping a team news hint on social media ahead of the game.

9’Arsenal in for winger Credit: AlamyArsenal are reportedly not too interested in signing a replacement for Gabriel Jesus as they are instead focused on signing a replacement for Nicolas Pepe.
Arsenal could be forgiven for panicking in January as Jesus’ injury leaves them with Eddie Nketiah as their only natural striker.
The report adds that the stumbling block in the way of Arsenal signing Mudryk is Shakhtar stating publicly that they ‘expect to receive £88m for his services’.
