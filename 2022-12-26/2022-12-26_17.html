     Summary: The Clippers rally late in regulation, then take the momentum in to overtime to grab a 142-131 win in overtime.
Bojan Bogdanovic led Detroit with 23 points, including the Pistons' only field goal of the last eight minutes.
"We were down 15 points in the third quarter, fought our way back, got the lead and had a comfortable lead with three minutes left," Pistons coach Dwane Casey said.
After a Clippers miss, Bogdanovic's short jumper put the Pistons up by nine and forced Lue to call timeout.
"I thought our defense is what changed the game," Lue said.

     Clippers vs. Pistons Recap: The Worst Win of the Year • 213hoops.com
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Clippers beat the Pistons 142-131 in overtime on the road to secure a win in one of the worst and most embarrassing basketball games I’ve ever seen.
Unfortunately, in a first-half theme, the Clippers were unable to get any separation because the Pistons kept making threes.
The Pistons cut into the lead, and then, somehow, took the lead during a four-minute Clippers’ scoring drought.
On a completely broken play, Terance made a midrange jumper to tie it up with five seconds left.
When the Clippers play three of these guys together, much less four, they’re asking for defensive breakdowns, no rim protection, and poor rebounding.

     Summary: DETROIT, MI - DECEMBER 26: Hamidou Diallo #6 of the Detroit Pistons shoots the ball during the game against the LA Clippers on December 26, 2022 at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, Michigan.
But the Clippers outscored the Pistons 16-2 in the last three minutes of regulation and never trailed in overtime to hand the Pistons a searing loss, their sixth straight.
Paul George then re-entered the game and had a chance to tie at the foul line with 22 seconds left but missed the first shot.
Killian Hayes also split a pair with 20 seconds left to keep it a two-point lead and Terrance Mann tied it on a short jump shot with five seconds left.
Jaden Ivey, like Stewart, began the second quarter with Alec Burks, Kevin Knox and Saddiq Bey.
