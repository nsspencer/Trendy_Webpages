     LA Clippers vs Detroit Pistons Injury Report Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The LA Clippers are looking to have a much-needed bounceback win against the Detroit Pistons, but they'll need to do it without the help of Kawhi Leonard.
Meaning, he'll likely play tomorrow against the Toronto Raptors instead.
The other players on the injury report are all in the G League: Brandon Boston (assignment), Moussa Diabate (two-way), and Jason Preston (assignment).
Cade Cunningham is out with a left tibia stress fracture, Isaiah Livers is out with a right shoulder sprain, Key Braxton is out on a G League two-way, and Buddy Boeheim is out on a G League two-way.
The very next game has the Toronto Raptors lined up, so it's imperative to take advantage of the easier games for LA.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Clippers bench came back to tie the game, and then the Clippers starters finished the job.
Nothing more than a young team going through a rebuild.
If there is one silver lining, the Pistons did not choke the game in the third quarter this time.
If the Pistons won this game, I would be writing about how balanced the scoring attack was with eight players scoring in double digits.
It is clear that the Pistons young players are getting more comfortable game by game.

     Summary: Solutions to being the worst team in the NBA, solutions to recent third-quarter blowouts, and solutions to losing eight of is past nine games.
But Dwane Casey is exploring changing up the lineups — either a new starting crew outright or switching things up in the third quarter.
ETWhere: Little Caesars Arena, Detroit, MichiganWatch: Ball Sports DetroitOdds: Pistons +6AnalysisThe Pistons are bad and routinely give up more than 120 points per game.
The Clippers aren’t playing great, though Kawhi Leonard is the forever wild card with that team.
Their offense is another story, but if I’m pitting LA’s putrid offense against Detroit’s awful defense, then I’m taking LA’s offense every time.

     Summary: DETROIT, MI - DECEMBER 26: Hamidou Diallo #6 of the Detroit Pistons shoots the ball during the game against the LA Clippers on December 26, 2022 at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, Michigan.
But the Clippers outscored the Pistons 16-2 in the last three minutes of regulation and never trailed in overtime to hand the Pistons a searing loss, their sixth straight.
Paul George then re-entered the game and had a chance to tie at the foul line with 22 seconds left but missed the first shot.
Killian Hayes also split a pair with 20 seconds left to keep it a two-point lead and Terrance Mann tied it on a short jump shot with five seconds left.
Jaden Ivey, like Stewart, began the second quarter with Alec Burks, Kevin Knox and Saddiq Bey.

     Clippers vs. Pistons Recap: The Worst Win of the Year • 213hoops.com
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Clippers beat the Pistons 142-131 in overtime on the road to secure a win in one of the worst and most embarrassing basketball games I’ve ever seen.
Unfortunately, in a first-half theme, the Clippers were unable to get any separation because the Pistons kept making threes.
The Pistons cut into the lead, and then, somehow, took the lead during a four-minute Clippers’ scoring drought.
On a completely broken play, Terance made a midrange jumper to tie it up with five seconds left.
When the Clippers play three of these guys together, much less four, they’re asking for defensive breakdowns, no rim protection, and poor rebounding.
