     Pistons Lose A Heartbreaker to the Clippers 142-131
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Clippers bench came back to tie the game, and then the Clippers starters finished the job.
Nothing more than a young team going through a rebuild.
If there is one silver lining, the Pistons did not choke the game in the third quarter this time.
If the Pistons won this game, I would be writing about how balanced the scoring attack was with eight players scoring in double digits.
It is clear that the Pistons young players are getting more comfortable game by game.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Clippers have had a few days off, and now get a bad Pistons team on the road before the end of December schedule gets very tough.
Still, the Pistons’ awful defense is a good game for the Clippers to boost their stats a bit.
NotesNo Kawhi, Yes Wall: John Wall is back after a game off, while Kawhi Leonard is out for tonight on the first of a back-to-back.
The Clippers clearly (and rightly) hope that they can beat the Pistons without Kawhi’s services, but will need him against the wing-heavy Raptors.
Nico Scorching: The Clippers’ offense has been buoyed by some renewed offense from superstar role player Nic Batum.

     Summary: The Clippers rally late in regulation, then take the momentum in to overtime to grab a 142-131 win in overtime.
Bojan Bogdanovic led Detroit with 23 points, including the Pistons' only field goal of the last eight minutes.
"We were down 15 points in the third quarter, fought our way back, got the lead and had a comfortable lead with three minutes left," Pistons coach Dwane Casey said.

     Clippers vs. Pistons Recap: The Worst Win of the Year • 213hoops.com
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Clippers beat the Pistons 142-131 in overtime on the road to secure a win in one of the worst and most embarrassing basketball games I’ve ever seen.
Unfortunately, in a first-half theme, the Clippers were unable to get any separation because the Pistons kept making threes.
The Pistons cut into the lead, and then, somehow, took the lead during a four-minute Clippers’ scoring drought.
On a completely broken play, Terance made a midrange jumper to tie it up with five seconds left.
When the Clippers play three of these guys together, much less four, they’re asking for defensive breakdowns, no rim protection, and poor rebounding.

     Summary: DETROIT — With 3:34 left in regulation Monday night, the Pistons led the Los Angeles Clippers by 14 points.
The Pistons thought the game was over as well, which, as time would tell, would be their death sentence.
“Those are guys who are professionals,” Pistons head coach Dwane Casey said of the Clippers bench unit that led the comeback win.
I don’t say that because the Pistons blew a lead or because they got manhandled when the game got tight.
