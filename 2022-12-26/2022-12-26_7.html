     UK retailers see 50% rise in Boxing Day shoppers over last year’s figures
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The number of shoppers hitting the Boxing Day sales has bounced back after last year’s Covid-hit Christmas – but remained well below levels seen before the pandemic.
The shopper tracking agency Springboard said there had been a 50% rise in shopper numbers out on Monday compared with Boxing Day last year, when the Omicron variant of Covid-19 prompted many to stay at home.
She said that the bounceback from last year was likely to have been assisted by Boxing Day falling on a Monday compared with a Sunday last year, when a number of large chains chose to remain closed while others reduced trading hours.
“Footfall has undoubtedly been helped by the calm and sunny weather, which will have encouraged consumers to make trips out.
The expected fall in Boxing Day trade compared with last year continues a long decline in popularity of the annual shopping tradition, as the rise of the US-inspired November discount day Black Friday and the move towards starting end-of-year sales before Christmas Day have combined to steal its thunder.
