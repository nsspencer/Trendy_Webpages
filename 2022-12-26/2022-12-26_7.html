     Playoff-bound Justin Herbert sends NFL Twitter into frenzy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa · 2 min readLos Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert is playing postseason football for the first time in his career, and unsurprisingly, the whole NFL Twitter is hyped up for him and his latest personal milestone.
The Chargers secured their spot in the playoffs after taking down the Indianapolis Colts in their Week 16 Monday Night Football game, 20-3.
He is one of the best young QBs in the league and certainly deserves to experience playoff football.
Former NFL player Robert Griffin III was ecstatic for Justin Herbert, saying, “The Chargers have done it!!!
JUSTIN HERBERT IS PLAYOFF BOUND FOR THE 1ST TIME.

That wasn't enough for Acho, though, who has held an agenda against the Los Angeles quarterback for much of this year.
Justin Herbert is a social media Quarterback.
SoCiAL mEdiA qUaRtErbAcK pic.twitter.com/lgCrRcJ7QL — Los Angeles Chargers (@chargers) November 23, 2022It seems Acho views Herbert's game as one that is more conducive to glitzy highlight tapes shared on social media than that of a productive quarterback.

     Column: Thanks to NFL changes, Herbert’s Super Bowl odds seem better than Philip Rivers’ were
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prolific passer Philip Rivers went to seven postseasons but never a Super Bowl, raising this question: why should his Chargers successor, Justin Herbert, be any different in his trophy pursuit?
It’s too soon to know if Herbert is more capable than Rivers, relative to their respective contemporaries.
What we do know is this: The NFL loves profits and will make even more money if its entertaining quarterbacks, like Herbert, appear in Super Bowl tournaments.
So, if he’s able to match or exceed Rivers’ longevity — 14 seasons as a starter — Herbert stands to get more bites at the apple.
4 seeds played in the recent Super Bowl, and a fifth seed, the Bucs, won the previous Super Bowl.

     Justin Herbert Masks Unfixable Issues for Playoff-Bound Los Angeles Chargers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The previous statement will be true no matter how well Los Angeles performs in the postseason after clinching a playoff berth with Monday's 20-3 victory over the dreadful and dysfunctional Indianapolis Colts.
Thankfully, Herbert orchestrated a game-winning drive with the remaining time before Cameron Dicker converted a 43-yard field goal.
Against the Colts, Herbert faced a single-game career high in pressure rate yet still completed plus-10.2% of his passes over expected, according to NFL Next Gen Stats.
It should also come as no surprise with a rebuilt front that Los Angeles ranks among the league's worst rushing attacks.
In the Chargers case, Herbert can be their sharpshooter, but the team is still firing blanks from the trenches.
