     Summary: The Reds are set to beat Manchester United to the £44m signing of the PSV Eindhoven and Netherlands forwardLiverpool’s January shopping looks to be well and truly underway.
Having celebrated Christmas with a 3-1 win at Aston Villa, there was more good news for Reds fans as it emerged that they had agreed a deal with PSV Eindhoven to sign the Dutch international forward Cody Gakpo.
The deal is expected to cost an initial £37 million (€42m/$45m), rising to around £44m (€50m/$53m) when add-ons are factored in.
Gakpo had initially been a target for the summer, but Liverpool moved swiftly to land the versatile forward, once it became clear PSV were open to selling in January.

     Summary: Bajcetic became the second youngest Spanish scorer in the Premier League after Cesc Fabregas for Arsenal in 2004.
The Scottish defender's pass for Salah's opener took him past Leighton Baines with the most assists of any defender in Premier League history, 54.
But when you do stuff like that and you're in the Premier League against some unbelievable defenders, it's always nice to put yourself at the top," Robertson said.
Liverpool are on 25 points, one behind old rivals Manchester United in fifth but a daunting 12 behind Premier League leaders Arsenal, who were playing later on Monday.
Villa were left to rue missed chances, including two scuffed shots from Leon Bailey and a fluffed close-range header from Watkins prior to his goal.

Liverpool’s third straight victory moved the club five points adrift of the Champions League spots, with Juergen Klopp’s side remaining sixth.
Liverpool rode its luck against midtable Villa, which put up a fight but missed chances and lacked the quality when it mattered most.
Liverpool’s Darwin Nunez dummied Andy Robertson’s cross, leading to Villa ‘keeper Robin Olsen and Tyrone Mings colliding and the defender needing treatment.
Liverpool took the sting out of Villa and eventually ended its hopes with nine minutes left when Bajcetic showed impressive composure in his first senior goal for Liverpool.

     What Cody Gakpo Transfer Means For Liverpool Now And In The Future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite the apparent swift nature of this deal, Liverpool will not have suddenly become interested in Gakpo during the World Cup, made a bid on Christmas Day and completed the deal on Boxing Day.
This is why Liverpool will have moved so quickly to get the deal done, but it does raise a few questions.
The real-life transfer market is not a simple case of a club deciding they want a player and signing them.
And even once those other attacking players return, Gakpo could still operate alongside them in the Liverpool team.
For Gakpo and Liverpool, everything fell into place at just the right time.

     Liverpool's signing of Cody Gakpo piles the pressure on Nunez
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gakpo will be the third significant attacking signing in 12 months by Liverpool, with Diaz arriving from Porto last January and Nunez completing a club-record transfer worth up to £85m in June.
Darwin Nunez will get extra competition for his place following the arrival of Cody Gakpo.
The answer, or much of it at least, is about Nunez and his hit-and-miss start to life at Liverpool.
Mohamed Farag/Getty ImagesNunez has expected goals (xG) of 5.9 in the Premier League this season, which places him in eighth position overall, between Newcastle's Callum Wilson and Leeds United's Rodrigo.
One such pass led to Salah scoring in the 3-2 defeat at the Etihad, but there were other instances at Villa when shooting at goal would have been the better course of action.
