     Knock At The Cabin Trailer: M. Night Shyamalan Presents An Apocalyptic Thriller (With A Twist)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leave it to M. Night Shyamalan to pull the rug out from under everyone's feet and surprise-drop the final trailer for his next thriller, "Knock at the Cabin," amidst the ongoing winter holiday festivities.
"I've never worked so hard on a film," tweeted Shyamalan.
Don't let the glimpses of CGI-heavy sequences in the final trailer mislead you, either; "Knock at the Cabin" will primarily be a tense, low-budget drama.
It was even shot with a 1990s-era camera lens to give it more of an "old school thriller look," as Shyamalan put it.
Joining Ben Aldridge, Jonathan Groff, Kristen Cui, and Dave Bautista in the "Knock at the Cabin" cast are Shyamalan's "Servant" star Rupert Grint and "Old" alum Nikki Amuka-Bird, along with Abby Quinn ("Mad About You").

     Knock at the Cabin Trailer 2 Sees the Fate of the World Resting on a Choice
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new trailer for M. Night Shyamalan’s Knock at the Cabin dropped on Christmas Day, bringing a new look at the director’s upcoming apocalyptic feature.
Knock at the Cabin is very much typical Shyamalan territory, with some big mysterious and terrifying event happening over the course of the movie that has a potentially supernatural twist.
Signs would have had that title prior to Knock at the Cabin.
He previously said:“I was really taken by what Denis [Villeneuve] and Dave [Bautista] did in that scene in Blade Runner [2049].
There’s a type of stillness where you’re not doing nothing; you’re doing everything and you’re still.
