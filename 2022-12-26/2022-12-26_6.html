     Whoopi Goldberg Repeats Holocaust Slur That Got Her Suspended From ‘The View’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actress Whoopi Goldberg has once again stated that the Holocaust was not related to race less than a year after she was suspended from ABC’s daytime talk show The View for making similar remarks.
Commenting on her Jewish-sounding stage name, Goldberg said in 2011 that she personally identifies with Judaism and feels Jewish.
When the interviewer, Janice Turner, pushed back by telling Goldberg, “Nazis saw Jews as a race,” the actress responded: “Yes, but that’s the killer, isn’t it?
Goldberg was suspended for two weeks from The View in January when she said on-air that the Holocaust “was not about race,” but rather about “man’s inhumanity to man,” during a discussion with her co-hosts.
Someone get this ignorant fool off the air!”Ari Ingel, director of the entertainment industry non-profit organization Creative Community for Peace, said, “Antisemitism deeply ingrained in Whoopi Goldberg.
