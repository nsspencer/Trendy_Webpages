     Whoopi Goldberg Doubles Down on Controversial Holocaust Views
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: *Whoopi Goldberg is once again sharing her views about the Holocaust, despite being briefly suspended from ABC’s “The View” earlier this year over her controversial remarks.
She also notes that Black people were targeted during the Holocaust but unlike the Jews, they could not easily blend in among White people while hiding from the Nazis.
Goldberg told Times columnist Janice Turner, “My best friend said, ‘Not for nothing is there no box on the census for the Jewish race.
So that leads me to believe that we’re probably not a race.’”READ MORE: Whoopi Goldberg Suspended From ‘The View’ for Controversial Holocaust RemarksTurner writes in the column that she informed Goldberg that “Nazis saw Jews as a race.” Whoopi replied, “Yes, but that’s the killer, isn’t it?
Why believe what they’re saying?”Turner pushed back with, “But since the Nazis devised racial laws aimed specifically at Jews, wasn’t the Holocaust about race?”“It wasn’t originally,” Whoopi responds.
