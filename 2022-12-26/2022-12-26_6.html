     Summary: The Reds are set to beat Manchester United to the £44m signing of the PSV Eindhoven and Netherlands forwardLiverpool’s January shopping looks to be well and truly underway.
Having celebrated Christmas with a 3-1 win at Aston Villa, there was more good news for Reds fans as it emerged that they had agreed a deal with PSV Eindhoven to sign the Dutch international forward Cody Gakpo.
The deal is expected to cost an initial £37 million (€42m/$45m), rising to around £44m (€50m/$53m) when add-ons are factored in.
Gakpo had initially been a target for the summer, but Liverpool moved swiftly to land the versatile forward, once it became clear PSV were open to selling in January.
Here, GOAL looks at where he could fit in at Anfield…

     Summary: Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareMANCHESTER, England — He was one of the standout performers at the World Cup and now PSV Eindhoven forward Cody Gakpo appears set to kick off the January transfer window with a move to Liverpool.
PSV announced on Monday that it had agreed an undisclosed fee for the Netherlands international.
Marcel Brands, PSV’s general manager, described the deal as a “record transfer” for the club.
“Things can change, but Cody has everything it takes to become a star,” said Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal.
However, injuries to Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota convinced Liverpool to move quickly for Gakpo.

     Summary: Bajcetic became the second youngest Spanish scorer in the Premier League after Cesc Fabregas for Arsenal in 2004.
The Scottish defender's pass for Salah's opener took him past Leighton Baines with the most assists of any defender in Premier League history, 54.
But when you do stuff like that and you're in the Premier League against some unbelievable defenders, it's always nice to put yourself at the top," Robertson said.
Liverpool are on 25 points, one behind old rivals Manchester United in fifth but a daunting 12 behind Premier League leaders Arsenal, who were playing later on Monday.
Villa were left to rue missed chances, including two scuffed shots from Leon Bailey and a fluffed close-range header from Watkins prior to his goal.

     Liverpool's signing of Cody Gakpo piles the pressure on Nunez
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gakpo will be the third significant attacking signing in 12 months by Liverpool, with Diaz arriving from Porto last January and Nunez completing a club-record transfer worth up to £85m in June.
Darwin Nunez will get extra competition for his place following the arrival of Cody Gakpo.
The answer, or much of it at least, is about Nunez and his hit-and-miss start to life at Liverpool.
Mohamed Farag/Getty ImagesNunez has expected goals (xG) of 5.9 in the Premier League this season, which places him in eighth position overall, between Newcastle's Callum Wilson and Leeds United's Rodrigo.
One such pass led to Salah scoring in the 3-2 defeat at the Etihad, but there were other instances at Villa when shooting at goal would have been the better course of action.

     Summary: Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk struck in the first half at Villa Park before Stefan Bajcetic scored near the end of the second.
Liverpool’s third straight victory moved the club five points adrift of the Champions League spots, with Juergen Klopp’s side remaining sixth.
Liverpool rode its luck against midtable Villa, which put up a fight but missed chances and lacked the quality when it mattered most.
Liverpool’s Darwin Nunez dummied Andy Robertson’s cross, leading to Villa ‘keeper Robin Olsen and Tyrone Mings colliding and the defender needing treatment.
Liverpool took the sting out of Villa and eventually ended its hopes with nine minutes left when Bajcetic showed impressive composure in his first senior goal for Liverpool.

     What Cody Gakpo Transfer Means For Liverpool Now And In The Future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite the apparent swift nature of this deal, Liverpool will not have suddenly become interested in Gakpo during the World Cup, made a bid on Christmas Day and completed the deal on Boxing Day.
This is why Liverpool will have moved so quickly to get the deal done, but it does raise a few questions.
The real-life transfer market is not a simple case of a club deciding they want a player and signing them.
And even once those other attacking players return, Gakpo could still operate alongside them in the Liverpool team.
For Gakpo and Liverpool, everything fell into place at just the right time.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No wonder PSV Eindhoven forward Cody Gakpo, who is set to cost an initial fee of £37million ($44.8m), is keen to move to Anfield.
A spare part for Gareth Southgate at the World Cup, the Liverpool right-back’s importance to Jurgen Klopp remains vast.
Like Liverpool, Alexander-Arnold faded after the interval.
Naby Keita, in Premier League action for the first time this season, and Harvey Elliott, playing out of position wide on the left, helped retain possession and wrestle back control.
He is the second youngest Spaniard to score in the Premier League behind Cesc Fabregas in 2004 (17 years 113 days).
