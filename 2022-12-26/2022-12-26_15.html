     Chargers' Derwin James ejected for illegal hit vs. Colts' Ashton Dulin on 'Monday Night Football'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chargers got Derwin James back on Monday night, welcoming their star safety to the secondary after a two-game absence due to injury.
James' return was short-lived, however, after the veteran defensive back was ejected for leading with his helmet on a hard second-quarter hit in Week 16's matchup with the Colts.
James, meanwhile, visited the Chargers' blue medical tent after getting flagged for unnecessary roughness; officials quickly announced he'd also been disqualified for the hit.
The hit, which came two plays after James was penalized for a face mask on Michael Pittman Jr., appeared to affect the Chargers safety even more than Dulin, at least immediately afterward.
James missed the Chargers' previous two games with a quad injury.

     Summary: Los Angeles Chargers All-Pro safety Derwin James was disqualified in the second quarter of Monday night's win over the Indianapolis Colts for a vicious, helmet-to-helmet hit on wide receiver Ashton Dulin.
In the immediate aftermath of the hit, James was flagged, then taken into the blue medical tent before walking to the locker room.
Dulin also went to the locker room, walking under his own power, and was subsequently ruled out with a concussion.
"I thought that he tried to lead with the shoulder," Staley said of James' intent on the play.
The play occurred with 5:19 remaining in the second quarter when Colts quarterback Nick Foles threw an incomplete pass into the flats to Dulin.
