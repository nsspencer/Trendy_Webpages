     Porter’s 36 points lead Rockets past Bulls 133-118
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CHICAGO (AP) — Kevin Porter Jr. scored a season-high 36 points and the Houston Rockets used a 17-1 run in the third quarter to beat the Chicago Bulls 133-118 on Monday night, snapping a five-game losing streak.
Alperan Sengun added 25 points and Jalen Green had 24 for Houston, which scored the first 10 points of the game but blew an 18-point lead before its third-quarter spurt.
The Rockets made 50 of 90 shots, scored 60 points in the paint and outrebounded the Bulls 56-43.
AdvertisingThe Rockets scored the first 10 points, and Sengun sparked Houston to a 23-5 lead thanks to his 4-for-4 shooting and 11 points less than five minutes into the game.
Houston guard Eric Gordon returned after missing five games because of a bruised left thumb and scored 12 points.

(Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images) Getty ImagesThe Chicago Bulls haven't met expectations this season, for a variety of reasons.
However, the Bulls are winners of three straight games, during which their three best players - Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, and Nikola Vučević - have all played up to par.
Caruso does offer elite perimeter defense, but his 5.3 points per game isn't exactly complementary to what the Bulls need.
If he doesn't break out of his seemingly perpetual nine points per game average, the Bulls aren't going anywhere.

     Summary: Unfortunately for the Bulls, it was the Rockets who were enjoying themselves, and they continued to have fun for four quarters.
The Bulls struggled to keep up.
“We have to find ways to sustain, have the stamina to do it night after night after night,” Donovan said.
The Rockets have the worst field-goal percentage in the league at 44.3% but shot 55.6% against the Bulls.
The lowly Rockets made a mockery of the Bulls on their home court, dropping them to 14-19 on the season.

     Summary: The Chicago Bulls fell directly into the jaws of a trap game at the United Center Monday night, falling 133-118 to the Western Conference-worst Houston Rockets.
The loss snapped a season-long three game win streak for the Bulls, dropping them to 14-19 on the season — and a harrowing 3-8 against teams below .500.
But ultimately, the Bulls' team defense markedly regressed from a three-game win streak that featured long strides in the competitiveness department.
The Bulls could not even take advantage of their propensity for giveaways, forcing just 13 turnovers (while the Rockets scored 15 points off eight Bulls cough-ups).
This Rockets team also entered tied for the fewest road wins in the league, 3-13, while the Bulls were 7-7 at home.

     Summary: LaVine's finishing kick is returning to form for Bulls originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoDon’t look now, but Zach LaVine’s finishing kick is returning to norm.
Long an elite finisher, LaVine’s shooting percentages in the restricted area and on drives hovered well below his career averages.
This is a reflection not only of LaVine’s jumpshooting ability — he’s at 37 percent on 7.5 3-point attempts per game — but also the Bulls’ lack of outside shooting.
Perhaps this is why LaVine’s free-throw attempts sit at just four per game, a number he and the Bulls would like to see climb.
I feel like I’ve been driving the ball well and getting to the line the last couple games,” LaVine said.

     Zach LaVine is finding his shooting form from both close and long range: ‘I felt like myself,’ the Chicago Bulls guard says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At the start of the season, Chicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine just wanted to get comfortable around the basket again.
But after offseason knee surgery and recovery, LaVine struggled to find the same confidence to start the season.
As the Bulls now near the midway point of the season, LaVine finally feels he has shaken the inconsistency — and gotten back to his signature style of play.
Most promising is a return to form around the basket, where LaVine is shooting 66.9% in the restricted area.
As the stingiest long-range shooting team in the league (28.9 3-point attempts per game entering Monday), the Bulls know they need to take more 3s.
