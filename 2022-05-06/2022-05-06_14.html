     Rafael Nadal says injuries leave him in pain 'every single day'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) An interaction with a reporter laid bare the toll a 21-year career has taken on Rafael Nadal's body, as the Spanish tennis star said he endures pain "every single day."
If you see me every single day, you wouldn't be worried.
I always have pain in my foot, especially after playing a three-hour match or a long training.
That's part of my life, and that's the downside of not being able to finish the match earlier.
In the short term, I think I am fine, physically speaking, but also, speaking about my feet, it has to adapt to competition.

     Rafael Nadal Upset in Madrid Open by 19-Year-Old Carlos Alcaraz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rafael Nadal suffered just his second loss of 2022 on Friday to no one other than his fellow Spaniard superstar Carlos Alcaraz.
The 19-year-old beat the 21-time grand slam winner 6–2, 1–6, 6–3 in the quarterfinals of the Madrid Open.
Since Roger Federer won his first grand slam at Wimbledon in 2003, he, Nadal or Djokovic have won 61 of the 74 grand slam tournaments.
That grand slam win solidified him as the all-time men’s leader in grand slams ahead of Djokovic and Roger Federer, who sit at 20 each.
It was unknown if he’d be back for clay season and the French Open, the grand slam tournament which he’s won 13 times.

     Carlos Alcaraz overpowers idol Rafael Nadal at Madrid Open
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MADRID -- In a clash of generations, Spanish teenage sensation Carlos Alcaraz overcame an injury to defeat his idol Rafael Nadal 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 in the Madrid Open quarterfinals on Friday.
Still far from his best form after a six-week injury layoff, Nadal predicted a hard time keeping up with the energy of Alcaraz.
Nadal's run was hampered by a rib stress fracture suffered in his semifinal win against Alcaraz in Indian Wells.
His other win against the ninth-ranked Alcaraz came in Madrid last year, when the youngster was just starting to attract everyone's attention.
Djokovic is trying to regain his best form after not being allowed to play in the Australian Open because he was not vaccinated.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alcaraz withstood a trademark Nadal fightback and a nasty second-set fall on the Madrid clay to prevail in an absorbing two-hour, 29-minute encounter.

Despite his opponent’s strong start, there was no panic from 36-time Masters 1000 champion Nadal, whose return game began to fire as he sensed a drop in Alcaraz’s level.
Even as Nadal tried to hit back there was no let-up from Alcaraz, who also won 61 per cent of points from defensive positions in the set.
It was the key.”The win takes Alcaraz to his third Masters 1000 semi-final and extends his winning streak against Top 10 opponents to five.
