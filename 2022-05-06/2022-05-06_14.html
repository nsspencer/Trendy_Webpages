     Fred Savage Fired As ‘The Wonder Years’ EP/Director Following Investigation Into Inappropriate Conduct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EXCLUSIVE: Disney is severing ties with Fred Savage following multiple complaints of misconduct in his role as executive producer and director on the freshman ABC comedy series The Wonder Years, produced by 20th Television, part of Disney Television Studios.
The Wonder Years, a reboot of the beloved 1988 series, which starred Savage, has not been renewed for a second season yet but remains in contention.
“Recently, we were made aware of allegations of inappropriate conduct by Fred Savage, and as is policy, an investigation was launched.
Details about the nature of the allegations are unclear, but I hear they included verbal outbursts and inappropriate behavior.
At the time, Savage called the allegations “completely without merit and absolutely untrue,” while 20th Television, which produced the show, said that, after an investigation into the claims, it found no evidence of wrongdoing by Savage.

     Fred Savage Fired from ‘The Wonder Years’ Over ‘Multiple’ Misconduct Claims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fred Savage has been fired from his role as executive producer and director of ABC’s The Wonder Years following an investigation into allegations of inappropriate conduct, according to a report.
Savage, who played the lead role of suburban teen Kevin Arnold in the original 1980s series, directed eight episodes of the reboot — including the pilot.
In a statement, Savage called Hwang’s claims “absolutely untrue,” while Fox said it “found no evidence of wrongdoing” after conducting an investigation.
In 1993, Savage, then 16, and his Wonder Years co-star Jason Hervey were accused of sexual harassment in a lawsuit filed by the show’s former costume designer.
Actress Alley Mills, who played Arnold family matriarch Norma on the show, called those allegations against Savage “completely ridiculous” in a 2018 interview with Yahoo!
