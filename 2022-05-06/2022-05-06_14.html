     Here’s What ‘The Wilds’ Season 2 Got Right (&amp; One Thing It Got Wrong)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: *Warning: Spoilers ahead*I'm a sucker for coming-of-age shows that explore feminist themes, so when I first heard about The Wilds, I just couldn't resist checking it out.
With such a compelling premise and honest portrayals of the female experience, it was virtually impossible to not devour each episode of season one.
The Prime Video series, which feels like a cross between Yellowjackets and Lord of the Flies, is equal parts bizarre and thought-provoking.
But now, in season two, which premieres May 6, the show follows a second control group of teenage boys who suffer the same fate.
Judging by the first episode, which jumps ahead seven days after the finale in season one, there's plenty more drama to come.

     Prime Video’s Entertaining The Wilds Gets a Little Lost in Second Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The girls who survived the crash had been placed there and monitored by the kooky head of the Dawn of Eve program, Gretchen Klein (Rachel Griffiths).
That’s where we meet young men like the charismatic Raf (Zack Calderon), alpha male Kirin (Charles Alexander), and outgoing Josh (Nicholas Coombe).
Largely through no fault of the young cast, the male characters in season two just aren't as richly drawn as the female ones in the first season.
Part of it could because of the crowded plotting with two less episodes and twice the characters.
That’s not the case here, but there are a few stand-outs: Miles Gutierrez-Riley and Alex Fitzalan feel like future stars.

     'The Wilds' Season 2: Breaking Down the "I Love You" Scene with Mia Healey &amp; Erana James
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [Editor's note: The following contains spoilers for The Wilds, Season 2, Episode 6, “46/26.”]There were many elements of The Wilds Season 1 that I was eager to see progress in the second season, but one of the things at the top of that list was the relationship between Erana James’ Toni and Mia Healey’s Shelby.
In Season 1, initial tensions between the two give way to the show’s fan-favorite romance.
Their relationship continues to grow stronger and stronger in Season 2 until some game-changing words are said.
Healey began:“At the beginning of Season 2 we see Shelby as the happiest we’ve ever seen her.
James offered up some insight into her approach to crafting that specific reaction:“It’s so heartbreaking I think.
