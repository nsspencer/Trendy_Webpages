     NBC Demotes Chuck Todd — Again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NBC is moving Chuck Todd‘s program Meet the Press Daily from MSNBC to the streaming service NBC News NOW, the network announced Friday.
Todd previously hosted Meet the Press Daily at 5 pm, a slot that draws much higher viewership numbers.
NBC and MSNBC viewers have turned on Todd because he’s not as loyal and progressive as the other hosts in the media.
Is @chucktodd a useful idiot for Republicans, spreading Republican propaganda because they play him, or does he willfully spread Republican propaganda for money &amp; access?
Chuck Todd isn’t left-wing enough for NBC News anymore, and he’s certainly not kooky enough for a daily program on MSNBC.

     Chuck Todd’s Daily ‘Meet the Press’ Show to Become Streaming-Only Offering
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meet the Press Daily, the MSNBC program based on the Sunday public affairs show, will go streaming-only beginning next month.
The show, which is anchored by Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd and runs at 1 pm weekdays, will be renamed Meet the Press Now, and will stream at 4 pm weekdays.
The 1 pm hour on MSNBC will be rebranded as MSNBC Reports, with veteran anchor and correspondent Chris Jansing set to lead the hour.
Moving Meet the Press‘ daily show to streaming is part of a larger push into streaming by NBC News, with the company continuing to invest in its NBC News Now streaming platform.

     MSNBC’s ‘Meet the Press Daily’ will move to streaming channel NBC News NOW
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In what may be the most significant commitment of a big name talent to a streaming news service, Chuck Todd’s MSNBC program “Meet the Press Daily” is moving to NBC News NOW.
“Meet the Press,” the flagship Sunday roundtable program that has aired on NBC’s broadcast network since 1947, is not affected by the move.
Todd, who is political director of NBC News, has been moderator of “Meet the Press” since 2014.
With the shutdown of CNN+ — which had signed former Fox News star Chris Wallace — Todd will be the most high-profile TV news talent to have a daily program on a streaming service.
Todd, 50, has embraced streaming through longform programs he has done on NBC’s platforms, including “Meet the Press Reports” for four seasons.

     Chuck Todd’s ‘Meet The Press Daily’ Jumps From MSNBC to Streaming
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: People who want to “Meet The Press” with Chuck Todd Monday through Friday will have to do so via their broadband connection, not their set-top box.
Todd’s streaming program will be called “Meet The Press Now.” Chris Jansing, the NBC News veteran, will take over his 1 p.m. hour on MSNBC.
Todd has embraced digital opportunities for several years now, including co-anchoring newscasts about recent midterm elections for NBC News’ streaming outlets.
And the switch of venues for “Meet The Press Daily” shows NBCUniversal’s growing ambitions in the world of streaming.
This is the second move of “Meet The Press Daily” in two years.
