     Claude Giroux a perfect fit with the Florida Panthers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE — When Claude Giroux was traded to the Florida Panthers, the assumption was he would play up on the top line with Sasha Barkov and that would be that.
On Thursday, the Panthers lined up for Game 2 against the Washington Capitals with Giroux — a certain future Hall of Famer — on their third line.
Giroux joined the Panthers in March, acquired in a blockbuster deal with the Philadelphia Flyers.
General manager Bill Zito said that the Panthers were certain Giroux was going to be a fit with his close-knit team before pulling the trigger on the deal.
In his final 18 regular season games with the Panthers, Giroux scored three goals with 23 points.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Advertisement“[Bobrovsky] was really good, really solid, gave us a chance to get our game,” Panthers coach Andrew Brunette said.
The night, maybe the season, didn’t splinter because Bobrovsky didn’t.
Due to that past and his position’s importance, Bobrovsky was the prime Panthers player with a spotlight on him these playoffs.
Washington star Alex Ovechkin, a fellow Russian, made a point to talk at Bobrovsky during Thursday’s game, needling him in some form.
Washington didn’t score as Bobrovsky had a couple of key saves.

Vanecek, who made 30 saves in Washington’s Game 1 win Tuesday, could very well be the starter Saturday, despite being pulled in Game 2.
1 goalie in the postseason, could go back to Vanecek for Game 3, though.
His solid third period Thursday could help put him in the right head space for a possible Game 3 start.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — The bounce-back game that the Florida Panthers needed started, perhaps fittingly, with a puck that took a fortuitous bounce.
Aleksander Barkov and Carter Verhaeghe each had a goal and an assist and the Panthers beat the Washington Capitals 5-1 on Thursday night to even the Eastern Conference first-round series at a game apiece.
The series shifts to Washington, with Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday night.
“The first period, I thought we did just about everything right and we’re down 2-0,” Capitals coach Peter Laviolette said.
… Florida made one change from Game 1 to Game 2, putting Noel Acciari in the lineup for Ryan Lomberg.

     Stanley Cup Playoffs Takeaways: Panthers’ daunting depth on full display
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Panthers began dominating after killing off a four-minute power play in the second period when the score was 2-1.
Panthers netminder Sergei Bobrovsky, who notoriously struggles in the playoffs, let in a soft goal from a bad angle early in the second period.
It was a New York Rangers franchise record and the second-most saves ever recorded in a single NHL game.
The superstar centre tied Steve Yzerman for 18th-most playoff goals in NHL history when he beat Shesterkin late in the second.
He and Ovechkin are the only active players with at least 70 playoff goals.
