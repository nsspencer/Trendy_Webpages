     What to Watch For in the 2022 Kentucky Derby
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Bob Baffert is absent from Churchill Downs, and his Barn 33, once the epicenter of the backside during Derby week, is oddly silent, but as the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby draws closer, the two-time Triple Crown-winning trainer is hardly forgotten.
The colts he trained until the end of March, Messier and Taiba, will be front of mind among casual fans and horseplayers on Saturday and very likely at the front of the pack after the gates of America’s most famous race open.
Baffert is serving a 90-day suspension handed down by Kentucky regulators after Medina Spirit, the apparent winner of last year’s Derby, failed a drug test and was disqualified.
The ongoing horse opera now has a new leading man: Tim Yakteen.
He is a former assistant and longtime friend of Baffert and knows the Hall of Famer’s system well.

There is noted turf trainer Chad Brown with another favorite trying to win his first Kentucky Derby.
With these four you have the Santa Anita Derby one-two in Taiba and Messier, the Blue Grass winner in Zandon and the Louisiana Derby winner in Epicenter.
That in itself makes this year’s running of the Derby different.”Epicenter is also coming out of the Louisiana Derby, which is becoming a new springboard to Kentucky Derby success.
“Asking Taiba to try and win the Kentucky Derby with only two races under his belt certainly is audacious.

     Summary: Medina Spirit crosses the finish line first during the 147th running of the Kentucky Derby.
Ones to watchDespite Baffert being banned from the race, two of his former horses have a good chance of success.
However, Epicenter and Zandon look to be the two standout picks heading into the race with both horses boasting great potential.
Epicenter’s trainer Steve Asmussen is the most successful in North American horse racing history but has failed to win the Derby in all of his 23 attempts.
Zandon, meanwhile, is coming off the back of an impressive performance last time out which has established it as the race favorite.
