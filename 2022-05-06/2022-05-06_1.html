     Summary: Trying to find a winner in this year’s 148th running of the Kentucky Derby is about as easy as getting through the week here without wet weather.
There is noted turf trainer Chad Brown with another favorite trying to win his first Kentucky Derby.
With these four you have the Santa Anita Derby one-two in Taiba and Messier, the Blue Grass winner in Zandon and the Louisiana Derby winner in Epicenter.
That in itself makes this year’s running of the Derby different.”Epicenter is also coming out of the Louisiana Derby, which is becoming a new springboard to Kentucky Derby success.
“Asking Taiba to try and win the Kentucky Derby with only two races under his belt certainly is audacious.

    </h2>

     Summary: Medina Spirit crosses the finish line first during the 147th running of the Kentucky Derby.
Ones to watchDespite Baffert being banned from the race, two of his former horses have a good chance of success.
However, Epicenter and Zandon look to be the two standout picks heading into the race with both horses boasting great potential.
Epicenter’s trainer Steve Asmussen is the most successful in North American horse racing history but has failed to win the Derby in all of his 23 attempts.
Zandon, meanwhile, is coming off the back of an impressive performance last time out which has established it as the race favorite.
