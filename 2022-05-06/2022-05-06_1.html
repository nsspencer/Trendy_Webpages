     Bad Bunny: Un Verano Sin Ti review – this is why he is the world’s biggest pop star
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the US, he is huge on a historic scale: the first artist to top the Billboard charts with an entirely Spanish-language album, El Último Tour Del Mundo.
Un Verano Sin Ti contains 23 tracks and goes on for the best part of an hour and a half.
Not everything here is as great as that – like most 23-track albums, Un Verano Sin Ti could have used a nip and a tuck.
But when it hits its heights, it leaves you puzzled at Britain’s lack of interest in Bad Bunny.
Perhaps Un Verano Sin Ti will change people’s minds – though if it doesn’t, you doubt Bad Bunny will be losing much sleep.

     Five Things We Learned From Bad Bunny’s ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He finally dropped Un Verano Sin Ti last night.
Still, Un Verano Sin Ti spans, and fully commits to, more genres than any of Bad Bunny’s previous work, probably because it’s his longest album and 23 songs gives him room to do a ton.
Bad Bunny often enlists collaborators who reflect the sharpest OGs and the brightest newcomers in reggaeton.
On every Bad Bunny album, there’s always a song that feels like a centerpiece.
But Bad Bunny also brings in under-the-radar producers, such as the low-key hitmaker La Paciencia and the emerging wunderkind Elikai.
