     What to Watch For in the 2022 Kentucky Derby
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Bob Baffert is absent from Churchill Downs, and his Barn 33, once the epicenter of the backside during Derby week, is oddly silent, but as the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby draws closer, the two-time Triple Crown-winning trainer is hardly forgotten.
The colts he trained until the end of March, Messier and Taiba, will be front of mind among casual fans and horseplayers on Saturday and very likely at the front of the pack after the gates of America’s most famous race open.
Baffert is serving a 90-day suspension handed down by Kentucky regulators after Medina Spirit, the apparent winner of last year’s Derby, failed a drug test and was disqualified.
The ongoing horse opera now has a new leading man: Tim Yakteen.
He is a former assistant and longtime friend of Baffert and knows the Hall of Famer’s system well.

     Summary: (CNN) The 148th edition of the Kentucky Derby is set to take place on Saturday as the iconic race looks to move on from last year's controversy.
The horse's trainer, Bob Baffert , was subsequently banned for two years from Churchill Downs and initial runner-up Mandaloun was announced the race winner.
Baffert later provided a lengthy statement claiming an ointment used to treat dermatitis may have caused the positive test.
Medina Spirit crosses the finish line first during the 147th running of the Kentucky Derby.
Ones to watchDespite Baffert being banned from the race, two of his former horses have a good chance of success.

Bluegrass Wise Man ™: Calm down, dammit.
Bluegrass Wise Man ™: It’s possible to worry about Big Money Mike, or his horse, without changing every bet you make.
In some form or fashion I’m going to bet Mo Donegal, Epicenter, Zandon, Crown Pride, Tawny Port and Cyberknife.
Bluegrass Wise Man ™: I see Epicenter being close enough that he will not have excuses if he gets away cleanly.
