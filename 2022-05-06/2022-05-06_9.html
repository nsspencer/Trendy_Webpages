     FDA Puts Strict Limits On Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID Vaccine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “We recognize that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine still has a role in the current pandemic response in the United States and across the global community.
The FDA says it has determined that the benefits of the J&amp;J vaccine outweigh the risks for certain people.
Both the CDC and the FDA previously recommended a pause in the use of this vaccine over reports of TTS.
The agency’s updated analysis of the vaccine includes cases reported to its Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database through March 18.
Overall, the risk of TTS is extremely rare: about three cases for every million doses of vaccine administered.

     Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine Restricted Due to Clotting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The reason, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA﻿) noted in its announcement, is due to a rare but potentially life-threatening complication called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, which was first linked to the J&amp;J vaccine in the spring of 2021.
About 3.23 cases of TTS have been reported per 1 million J&amp;J doses; some have been fatal.
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are made using the mRNA technology, which is different from the J&amp;J product.
TTS is a rare but ongoing issueWhen cases of TTS first surfaced last spring, health officials paused the use of the J&amp;J vaccine to review its safety, eventually determining that its benefits outweighed any risks.
The vast majority of vaccinated Americans have been inoculated with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which studies show are more effective against COVID-19 and have not been linked to TTS.

     FDA restricts Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine due to blood clot risk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. regulators on Thursday strictly limited who can receive Johnson &amp; Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine due to the ongoing risk of rare but serious blood clots.
U.S. authorities for months have recommended that Americans starting their COVID-19 vaccinations use the Pfizer or Moderna shots instead.
FDA officials said in a statement that they decided to restrict J&amp;J's vaccine after taking another look at data on the risk of life-threatening blood clots within two weeks of vaccination.
That amounts to one blood clot case per 3.23 million J&amp;J shots administered, the FDA said Thursday.
Additionally, regulators added warnings about the blood clots and a rare neurological reaction called Guillain-Barré syndrome.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Jersey on Friday reported eight COVID-19 deaths and 3,387 new confirmed positive tests as the FDA puts a stop to the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine in fear of possible blood clots.
There were at least 131 people discharged in that same 24-hour period ending Thursday night, according to state data.
For the week ending April 16, BA.2 accounted for 97.2% of the positive tests sampled (up from 88.9% the previous week), while the omicron variant accounted for 2% of positive tests sampled.
And there are numerous cases that have likely never been counted, including at-home positive tests that are not included in the state’s numbers.
GLOBAL NUMBERSAs of Friday, there have been more than 516 million COVID-19 cases reported across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University, with more than 6.2 million people having died due to the virus.
