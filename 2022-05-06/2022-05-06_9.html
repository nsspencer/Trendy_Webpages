     TRENDING: Phil Mickelson Allegedly had $40 Million in Gambling Losses from 2010 to 2014
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Author Alan Shipnuck released another part of his upcoming unauthorized biography on Phil Mickelson on Thursday, revealing that the golfer totaled $40 million in gambling losses in five years from 2010-14.
In February, Shipnuck posted comments from Mickelson where he criticized the Saudi Arabian government but said it was worth getting involved with the LIV Tour (that the Saudis are backing financially) in order to give him and other golfers some leverage against the PGA Tour.
Mickelson hasn’t played since, he lost several sponsors, and Greg Norman, the CEO of the LIV Tour, said that several golfers backed out of their commitment to the tour and even returned appearance money after Mickelson’s comments were made public.
Mickelson is trying to play in the LIV Tour opener in London next month.
Published reports state that he is getting a $30 million appearance fee to play in the tour’s eight events this year, and that’s not counting any prize money he can earn in the tournaments.

     ‘Brazen’ Phil Mickelson once made 50 bets in 20 minutes in front of stunned reporter

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phil Mickelson’s alleged gambling adrenaline reached ominous levels in front of a reporter that was admittedly uncomfortable about what he had witnessed.
“Over 20 minutes he must’ve made 50 bets,” Hawkins says, according to the book.
Phil Mickelson in February 2022 Getty Images“I’ve wondered about Phil’s motivation in being so brazen in front of me,” says Hawkins.
Mickelson suffered a staggering $40 million gambling loss between 2010 and 2014, according to his biographer.
“Throw in all the other expenses of a big life — like an actual T. Rex skull for a birthday present — and that leaves, what, $10 million?” Shipnuck writes.

     Phil Mickelson reportedly lost $40 million gambling from 2010-’14
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY SportsThe upcoming Phil Mickelson biography Phil: The Rip-Roaring (and Unauthorized) Biography of Golf’s Most Colorful Superstar already resulted in the Saudi Arabia scandal that ostracized Mickelson from the PGA and his peers.
One such detail from an excerpt shared by FirePitCollective.com shows how Mickelson’s PGA victories at times had to make up for his gambling losses.
Phil Mickelson net worth: $400 millionAccording to Shipnuck, an investigation into Phil’s financial records by government auditors as part of an inquiry into insider trading found that he lost more than $40 million gambling from 2010-’14.
It came at a time when many estimates put Mickelson’s salary at around $40 million per year, not including taxes.
In February, ESPN’s Mark Schlabach obtained an excerpt from the upcoming book and posted Mickelson’s comments about using the Saudis as leverage against the PGA Tour.
