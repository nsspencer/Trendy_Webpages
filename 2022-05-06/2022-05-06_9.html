     Summary: Phil Mickelson’s alleged gambling adrenaline reached ominous levels in front of a reporter that was admittedly uncomfortable about what he had witnessed.
“Over 20 minutes he must’ve made 50 bets,” Hawkins says, according to the book.
Phil Mickelson in February 2022 Getty Images“I’ve wondered about Phil’s motivation in being so brazen in front of me,” says Hawkins.
Mickelson suffered a staggering $40 million gambling loss between 2010 and 2014, according to his biographer.
“Throw in all the other expenses of a big life — like an actual T. Rex skull for a birthday present — and that leaves, what, $10 million?” Shipnuck writes.

     Phil Mickelson reportedly lost $40 million gambling from 2010-’14
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY SportsThe upcoming Phil Mickelson biography Phil: The Rip-Roaring (and Unauthorized) Biography of Golf’s Most Colorful Superstar already resulted in the Saudi Arabia scandal that ostracized Mickelson from the PGA and his peers.
One such detail from an excerpt shared by FirePitCollective.com shows how Mickelson’s PGA victories at times had to make up for his gambling losses.
Phil Mickelson net worth: $400 millionAccording to Shipnuck, an investigation into Phil’s financial records by government auditors as part of an inquiry into insider trading found that he lost more than $40 million gambling from 2010-’14.
It came at a time when many estimates put Mickelson’s salary at around $40 million per year, not including taxes.
In February, ESPN’s Mark Schlabach obtained an excerpt from the upcoming book and posted Mickelson’s comments about using the Saudis as leverage against the PGA Tour.

And Mickelson’s income dropped considerably during his winless years from 2014 to ’17.”I’ve always thought of Phil as a real life Shooter McGavin.
