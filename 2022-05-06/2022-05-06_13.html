     Oettinger Makes 29 Saves, Lift Stars Over Flames 2-0
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jake Oettinger made 29 saves and got his first postseason shutout in his second career playoff start to lift the Dallas Stars over the Calgary Flames 2-0 on Thursday night to even their first-round series at a game each.
Joe Pavelski scored and Michael Raffl added an empty-net goal for the Stars.
The best-of-seven conference quarterfinal series heads to Dallas for Saturday’s Game 3 and Monday’s Game 4 at American Airlines Arena.
The Flames were denied by Oettinger, however, and didn’t get their sticks on the few rebounds the goaltender allowed.
The Flames went 0 for 3 on Thursday and scored one power-play goal on eight chances through the first two games.
