     Summary: Listen to this articleThe main area of concern is Turn 17, the left-hand hairpin before the final corners that lead on to the start/finish straight.
There was also an issue with Turn 7, the tightening left hander located adjacent to the now infamous fake marina.
The problematic areas are believed to be localised, and there are no concerns about the rest of the track.

     Summary: Until the Formula One season stops being a two-man race, oddsmakers aren’t going to open themselves to value wagering.
The inaugural Miami Grand Prix on Sunday is the fifth race of the season — following stops in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Italy.
Defending F1 champion Verstappen is the -105 favorite, while Leclerc is the +140 second choice, according to Tipico Sportsbook.
F1 legend Lewis Hamilton struggled this season in his Mercedes and is seventh in the points standings with one podium finish.
McLaren’s US CEO Zak Brown would be extremely happy with a second consecutive podium for Norris and it’s within his reach."

     Summary: Nate Saunders and Laurence Edmondson join Nicole Briscoe to wonder if home team Haas can shine in Miami.
In Miami, the FIA banned jewellery under a scrutineering declaration form distributed to all teams and has clarified which clothing drivers must wear underneath their overalls for safety reasons.
Lewis Hamilton joked during Friday's press conference he could not have worn any more jewellery.
"I've been in the sport for 16 years and I've been wearing jewellery for 16 years.
I do feel like its personal, we should have the freedom to do what we feel is right for us.

     Summary: IMAGO / Icon SMIMIAMI—Lewis Hamilton made a strong statement against the FIA’s jewelry ban on Friday in more ways than one.
Ahead of the Miami Grand Prix, race director Niels Wittich reminded drivers they could not wear jewelry in the car per the governing body’s International Sporting Code.
“It has never been a safety issue in the past,” Hamilton said.

     Summary: Hamilton turned up to Friday's FIA press conference wearing three watches, eight rings, bracelets and a necklace, and claimed it was "unnecessary" for officials to be focusing on "such a small thing".
"It's almost like a step backwards," Hamilton said.
Hamilton's view was supported by a number of drivers, including Sebastian Vettel, who felt the moves clamping down on jewellery were "targeting" Hamilton.
Motorsport.com has learned that Hamilton met with officials from the FIA's medical commission following the press conference to discuss the matter.
As well as clamping down on jewellery, drivers have also been reminded about wearing the correct underwear while in the car, again on safety grounds.

     Summary: Really, you’d be hard pressed to find a more postcard-perfect venue for an F1 race.
“This is environmental racism,” Ferguson declared, “pure and simple.”Last May a recall election was sought to remove council members who voted to bring the race to Miami Gardens.
What’s more, Miami Gardens residents are locked into this deal for a decade, with F1 president Stefano Domenicali promising to leave “a positive and lasting contribution for the people in the local community”.
It’s an undercurrent of controversy that puts Miami squarely in league with Sochi, Saudi Arabia and other dubious F1 crash pads.
So it figures that a Grand Prix would finally wind up here.

     Lewis Hamilton unhappy with F1 ban on jewelry, but removes earrings despite threats to sit out

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hamilton will now remove his ear piercings for this weekend hours after indicating he was willing to sit out the Miami Grand Prix in defiance of F1's rules.
I've been in the sport for 16 years, I've been wearing jewelry for 16 years.
In the car I only ever have my earrings on and my nose ring, of which I can't even remove.
Hamilton's being at-odds with FIA officials over the jewelry ban presents an off-track distraction from what has been a terrible start to the 2022 season for the seven-time world champion.
Hamilton enters Miami seventh in the championship standings, a full 58 points back of Charles Leclerc.

     Hamilton: FIA clampdown on F1 drivers wearing jewellery "a step backwards"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New F1 race director Niels Wittich reminded drivers prior to the Australian Grand Prix in April that the FIA International Sporting Code prohibits drivers wearing jewellery in the car.
In the drivers’ briefing at the event, it was also reaffirmed that underwear, gloves, socks and balaclavas must be FIA homologated.
But seven-time world champion Hamilton, who joked he could not fit any more jewellery on, said the renewed focus was “a step backwards” and could provoke an “unnecessary spat”.
But Hamilton had the support of his fellow drivers, with AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly saying “there are bigger things to focus on” and that wearing jewellery should be a personal choice.
We should have the freedom to do what feels right.”Hamilton closed by saying he would readily sign a waiver that allowed him to continue wearing jewellery in the car and therefore ease the safety responsibility felt by the FIA.
