     Summary: National Nurses Day at MemorialToday is National Nurses Day and Memorial Hospital honored its frontline workers with gift baskets.
The job can be tough and sometimes even thankless, but these nurses at Memorial have a passion for their duties and have stuck with it through COVID.
Doctors and surgeons might get a lot of recognition, but it’s the nurses who run the floor.
Memorial Director of Business Development Ashley Comstock said, “With everything they’ve just been through, it’s more important now than ever for us to show appreciation for the work they do, all of the time they put into it.
They go above and beyond, it’s not just the medicinal part of it, they also serve as therapists, best friends, and caregivers and someone these patients can talk to when they don’t have a family member with them.”National Nursing Week lasts through next Thursday.
