     Soccer-Martinez fires Inter to top of Serie A with comeback win over Empoli
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Reuters) -Two goals from Argentine striker Lautaro Martinez helped Inter Milan secure a nervy 4-2 home win over Empoli on Friday as Simone Inzaghi’s side kept their Serie A title hopes alive and provisionally went top of the table.
Inter struggled considerably in the first half against an Empoli side who have won just once in their last 20 games in all competitions and soon found themselves 2-0 down.
The 22-year-old, who recently netted against AC Milan, Roma and twice against Napoli, did not celebrate scoring on Friday as he is on loan from Inter.
Empoli scored again five minutes later through Szymon Zurkowski but the goal was disallowed by VAR due to an offside but they doubled their lead in the 28th minute.
While Inter must wait to discover their fate in the title race, they will have a chance to win a trophy on Wednesday when they face Juventus in the Coppa Italia final.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Serie A heads into Matchday 36 this weekend with just a few matches left to play as the title race heats up.
AC Milan currently holds the lead with 77 points, but last year’s champions Inter Milan are hot on their trail, sitting just two points behind at 75.
According to DraftKings Sportsbook, AC Milan is favored to win the league with odds at -150.
Inter Milan is close behind with their odds at +110.
They’ll look to jump out of the relegation zone as they face off against 17th-place Cagliari this weekend, who sits just two points above them.

     Inter fight back to go top of Serie A as Genoa dramatically boost survival hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But an own goal by Simone Romagnoli gave the hosts hope and Martinez pulled them level at 2-2 on the stroke of half-time.
Struggling Genoa boosted their survival hopes in dramatic fashion as they scored twice in the last three minutes to sink fourth-placed Juventus 2-1.
It lifts Genoa level with third-bottom Cagliari and one point off safety with two games of their season remaining.
A last-gasp penalty also gave Levante hope of avoiding the drop from LaLiga as they beat Real Sociedad 2-1.
They would be relegated on Sunday if Stuttgart win, though that game is away at champions Bayern Munich.

Empoli: The team coached by Aurelio Andreazzoli is now mathematically safe and will play again Serie A soccer next season.
PredictionInter Milan need to win the match in order to put more pressure on their rivals and considering that Empoli are arithmetically safe they shouldn't have so many issues at San Siro this time.

     European round-up: Inter Milan return to top of Serie A after Empoli scare while Juventus lose to Genoa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inter Milan nearly threw away their Serie A title chances but came from 2-0 at home to Empoli to win 4-2 - and return to the top of the Italian top flight for 48 hours at least.
Simone Romagnoli's own goal clawed one back for Inter, before Lautaro Martinez equalised five minutes later leaving Inzaghi's side level at the break.
Meanwhile, Juventus chucked away three points by conceding two late goals in their 2-1 loss at Genoa, to mathematically rule themselves out of an unlikely Serie A title challenge.
Genoa equalised through substitute Albert Gudmundsson with three minutes of normal time remaining - but the drama wasn't done yet.
Marseille, who began the weekend in second, can reclaim their spot on Sunday if they beat Lorient.
