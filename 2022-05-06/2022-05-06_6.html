     Lewis Hamilton unhappy with F1 ban on jewelry, but removes earrings despite threats to sit out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hamilton will now remove his ear piercings for this weekend hours after indicating he was willing to sit out the Miami Grand Prix in defiance of F1's rules.
I've been in the sport for 16 years, I've been wearing jewelry for 16 years.
In the car I only ever have my earrings on and my nose ring, of which I can't even remove.
Hamilton's being at-odds with FIA officials over the jewelry ban presents an off-track distraction from what has been a terrible start to the 2022 season for the seven-time world champion.
Hamilton enters Miami seventh in the championship standings, a full 58 points back of Charles Leclerc.

     Summary: Nate Saunders and Laurence Edmondson join Nicole Briscoe to wonder if home team Haas can shine in Miami.
In Miami, the FIA banned jewellery under a scrutineering declaration form distributed to all teams and has clarified which clothing drivers must wear underneath their overalls for safety reasons.
Lewis Hamilton joked during Friday's press conference he could not have worn any more jewellery.
"I've been in the sport for 16 years and I've been wearing jewellery for 16 years.
I do feel like its personal, we should have the freedom to do what we feel is right for us.

     Summary: Hamilton turned up to Friday's FIA press conference wearing three watches, eight rings, bracelets and a necklace, and claimed it was "unnecessary" for officials to be focusing on "such a small thing".
"It's almost like a step backwards," Hamilton said.
Hamilton's view was supported by a number of drivers, including Sebastian Vettel, who felt the moves clamping down on jewellery were "targeting" Hamilton.
Motorsport.com has learned that Hamilton met with officials from the FIA's medical commission following the press conference to discuss the matter.
As well as clamping down on jewellery, drivers have also been reminded about wearing the correct underwear while in the car, again on safety grounds.

     F1 touches down in US for Miami GP amid undercurrent of controversy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Really, you’d be hard pressed to find a more postcard-perfect venue for an F1 race.
“This is environmental racism,” Ferguson declared, “pure and simple.”Last May a recall election was sought to remove council members who voted to bring the race to Miami Gardens.
What’s more, Miami Gardens residents are locked into this deal for a decade, with F1 president Stefano Domenicali promising to leave “a positive and lasting contribution for the people in the local community”.
It’s an undercurrent of controversy that puts Miami squarely in league with Sochi, Saudi Arabia and other dubious F1 crash pads.
So it figures that a Grand Prix would finally wind up here.

     Summary: On the eve of the Miami Grand Prix the groundbreaking, black American driver is typically effusive in his admiration for Lewis Hamilton, who he believes has fundamentally changed Formula One.
“Now Lewis Hamilton in this country is a huge name with African-Americans and people of colour.
“I thought of myself as a race driver not as a driver of any particular colour.
Ribbs believes Hamilton is doing similarly inspiring work in ensuring F1 has an audience for the future in the US but of course has a singularly Willy T take on it.
“I see Lewis as the best ambassador for diversity and inclusion and I see Willy T Ribbs as the second-best ambassador.

     Summary: Fernando Alonso surged ahead a few minutes later on a 1m32.094s, also on the yellow-walled rubber, before Sainz moved back in front on a 1m31.463s.
Alonso looked set to use his softs to forge ahead of Sainz's medium-tyre benchmark, but he came across Verstappen going slowly at the chicane and had to back out.
The Red Bull driver had only just left the pits for the first time after Red Bull had replaced his gearbox after encountering overheating issues in FP1.
Behind the leaders, the top 10 was completed by Alonso, Lando Norris, Pierre Gasly, Zhou, Ocon and Magnussen.
Bottas also did not set a time as his car could not be repaired in time following his FP1-ending shunt.

"The German landscape is for sure a very interesting landscape," he said in a call with Wall Street analysts.
However, former world champion Sebastian Vettel remains doubtful that one of the German venues can afford to hold a grand prix.
"We'll see what will happen in the next years, but it would be great if Germany was back on the calendar."
"So as I said, that is really our strategic thinking with regard to our future calendar."
