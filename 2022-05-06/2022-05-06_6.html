     Summary: FDA Restricts Use Of J&amp;J Covid VaccineAfter review of rare cases of blood clots, the FDA limits the parameters for who can get Johnson &amp; Johnson's one-dose shot to adults who cannot get either of the approved mRNA covid vaccines.
Politico: FDA Dramatically Narrows Use Of Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 VaccineThe Food and Drug Administration has restricted the use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine to adults who are unable or unwilling to get the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA shots.
(Branswell, 5/5)AP: FDA Restricts J&amp;J's COVID-19 Vaccine Due To Blood Clot RiskThe Food and Drug Administration said the shot should only be given to adults who cannot receive a different vaccine or specifically request J&amp;J’s vaccine.
U.S. authorities for months have recommended that Americans get Pfizer or Moderna shots instead of J&amp;J’s vaccine.
FDA’s vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said the agency decided to restrict the vaccine after taking another look at the data on the risks of life-threatening blood clots and concluding that they are limited to J&amp;J’s vaccine.

     Summary: “We recognize that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine still has a role in the current pandemic response in the United States and across the global community.
The FDA says it has determined that the benefits of the J&amp;J vaccine outweigh the risks for certain people.
Both the CDC and the FDA previously recommended a pause in the use of this vaccine over reports of TTS.
The agency’s updated analysis of the vaccine includes cases reported to its Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database through March 18.
Overall, the risk of TTS is extremely rare: about three cases for every million doses of vaccine administered.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. regulators on Thursday strictly limited who can receive Johnson &amp; Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine due to the ongoing risk of rare but serious blood clots.
U.S. authorities for months have recommended that Americans starting their COVID-19 vaccinations use the Pfizer or Moderna shots instead.
FDA officials said in a statement that they decided to restrict J&amp;J's vaccine after taking another look at data on the risk of life-threatening blood clots within two weeks of vaccination.
That amounts to one blood clot case per 3.23 million J&amp;J shots administered, the FDA said Thursday.
Additionally, regulators added warnings about the blood clots and a rare neurological reaction called Guillain-Barré syndrome.

     Summary: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is limiting the use of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 vaccine as a last resort for adults who cannot accept a shot from another manufacturer.
Though the potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, the FDA said Thursday that it is restricting the use of the Janssen vaccine.
This leads to rare but potentially life-threatening blood clots, the FDA said, one to two weeks after receiving the shot.
In the release, the FDA said, "The factors that put an individual at risk for TTS following administration of Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine remain unknown."
The Janssen vaccine rollout was first paused last spring after six cases of the rare blood clots were reported.
