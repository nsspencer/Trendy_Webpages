     Lewis Hamilton unhappy with F1 ban on jewelry, but removes earrings despite threats to sit out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hamilton will now remove his ear piercings for this weekend hours after indicating he was willing to sit out the Miami Grand Prix in defiance of F1's rules.
I've been in the sport for 16 years, I've been wearing jewelry for 16 years.
In the car I only ever have my earrings on and my nose ring, of which I can't even remove.
Hamilton's being at-odds with FIA officials over the jewelry ban presents an off-track distraction from what has been a terrible start to the 2022 season for the seven-time world champion.
Hamilton enters Miami seventh in the championship standings, a full 58 points back of Charles Leclerc.

     Summary: Nate Saunders and Laurence Edmondson join Nicole Briscoe to wonder if home team Haas can shine in Miami.
In Miami, the FIA banned jewellery under a scrutineering declaration form distributed to all teams and has clarified which clothing drivers must wear underneath their overalls for safety reasons.
Lewis Hamilton joked during Friday's press conference he could not have worn any more jewellery.
"I've been in the sport for 16 years and I've been wearing jewellery for 16 years.
I do feel like its personal, we should have the freedom to do what we feel is right for us.

     How Mercedes F1 hopes to gain from its extreme front wing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Listen to this articleWhile at the back of the car, Mercedes has played things pretty conventional with its low drag rear wing, at the front it has taken things to the extreme with its endplate, which offers a hint at how it intends to push forward with the W13.
Having been plagued by the ill effects of porpoising since the campaign got underway, Mercedes has a clear intention of better managing the way the car behaves so it can run it lower to the ground.
However, it’s the outer corner of the front wing that the team seems to have placed the highest priority on overhauling.
The flaps have been swept forward very aggressively in the outer section, so the rear lower edge of the endplate is completely detached from the flaps.

     Summary: Asked about the possibility of a race in Germany, Domencali made a clear reference to the VW Group's entry.
"The German landscape is for sure a very interesting landscape," he said in a call with Wall Street analysts.
However, former world champion Sebastian Vettel remains doubtful that one of the German venues can afford to hold a grand prix.
"We'll see what will happen in the next years, but it would be great if Germany was back on the calendar."
"So as I said, that is really our strategic thinking with regard to our future calendar."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Really, you’d be hard pressed to find a more postcard-perfect venue for an F1 race.
“This is environmental racism,” Ferguson declared, “pure and simple.”Last May a recall election was sought to remove council members who voted to bring the race to Miami Gardens.
What’s more, Miami Gardens residents are locked into this deal for a decade, with F1 president Stefano Domenicali promising to leave “a positive and lasting contribution for the people in the local community”.
It’s an undercurrent of controversy that puts Miami squarely in league with Sochi, Saudi Arabia and other dubious F1 crash pads.
So it figures that a Grand Prix would finally wind up here.

     From Vice to F1: The story of Miami's other grands prix

     Summary: “It’s been a great motorsport city mainly because of the late Ralph Sanchez.
We shot the scenes at the track right on Biscayne Boulevard.
Racing returned to Miami’s streets when Formula E ran a one-off event on a downtown track in 2015, using the Miami Heat stadium’s infrastructure.
The layout looped around the arena, before heading north on Biscayne Boulevard and turning left to loop around to NE 2nd Ave underneath the elevated MacArthur Causeway and then back past Museum Park.
Ahead of the planned F1 downtown race for 2019, an official ‘F1 Festival’ event was held on Biscayne Boulevard in October 2018 – with Emmo Fittipaldi starring in a McLaren M23 along with demonstration F1 cars from Red Bull and Renault.
