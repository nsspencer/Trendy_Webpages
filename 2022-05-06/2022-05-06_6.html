     Summary: Nate Saunders and Laurence Edmondson join Nicole Briscoe to wonder if home team Haas can shine in Miami.
In Miami, the FIA banned jewellery under a scrutineering declaration form distributed to all teams and has clarified which clothing drivers must wear underneath their overalls for safety reasons.
Lewis Hamilton joked during Friday's press conference he could not have worn any more jewellery.
"I've been in the sport for 16 years and I've been wearing jewellery for 16 years.
I do feel like its personal, we should have the freedom to do what we feel is right for us.

     Lewis Hamilton unhappy with F1 ban on jewelry, but removes earrings despite threats to sit out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hamilton will now remove his ear piercings for this weekend hours after indicating he was willing to sit out the Miami Grand Prix in defiance of F1's rules.
I've been in the sport for 16 years, I've been wearing jewelry for 16 years.
In the car I only ever have my earrings on and my nose ring, of which I can't even remove.
Hamilton's being at-odds with FIA officials over the jewelry ban presents an off-track distraction from what has been a terrible start to the 2022 season for the seven-time world champion.
Hamilton enters Miami seventh in the championship standings, a full 58 points back of Charles Leclerc.

     Summary: IMAGO / Icon SMIMIAMI—Lewis Hamilton made a strong statement against the FIA’s jewelry ban on Friday in more ways than one.
Ahead of the Miami Grand Prix, race director Niels Wittich reminded drivers they could not wear jewelry in the car per the governing body’s International Sporting Code.
“It has never been a safety issue in the past,” Hamilton said.

     Summary: Listen to this articleThe main area of concern is Turn 17, the left-hand hairpin before the final corners that lead on to the start/finish straight.
There was also an issue with Turn 7, the tightening left hander located adjacent to the now infamous fake marina.
The problematic areas are believed to be localised, and there are no concerns about the rest of the track.

     F1 touches down in US for Miami GP amid undercurrent of controversy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Really, you’d be hard pressed to find a more postcard-perfect venue for an F1 race.
“This is environmental racism,” Ferguson declared, “pure and simple.”Last May a recall election was sought to remove council members who voted to bring the race to Miami Gardens.
What’s more, Miami Gardens residents are locked into this deal for a decade, with F1 president Stefano Domenicali promising to leave “a positive and lasting contribution for the people in the local community”.
It’s an undercurrent of controversy that puts Miami squarely in league with Sochi, Saudi Arabia and other dubious F1 crash pads.
So it figures that a Grand Prix would finally wind up here.

Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Erik Junius"These past couple of weeks and months since day one really have been vital into understanding the problem and developing the tools to be able to find solutions.
Asked if he expected the upgrades in time for Miami to close the pace to the leading Ferrari F1-75 (adapted rear wing for Miami) and Red Bull RB18 (no new parts), Hamilton replied: "I don't anticipate much change in that sense."
"We've got a new rear wing, for example.

However, former world champion Sebastian Vettel remains doubtful that one of the German venues can afford to hold a grand prix.
"We'll see what will happen in the next years, but it would be great if Germany was back on the calendar."

Defending F1 champion Verstappen is the -105 favorite, while Leclerc is the +140 second choice, according to Tipico Sportsbook.

     How Mercedes F1 hopes to gain from its extreme front wing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Listen to this articleWhile at the back of the car, Mercedes has played things pretty conventional with its low drag rear wing, at the front it has taken things to the extreme with its endplate, which offers a hint at how it intends to push forward with the W13.
Having been plagued by the ill effects of porpoising since the campaign got underway, Mercedes has a clear intention of better managing the way the car behaves so it can run it lower to the ground.
However, it’s the outer corner of the front wing that the team seems to have placed the highest priority on overhauling.
The flaps have been swept forward very aggressively in the outer section, so the rear lower edge of the endplate is completely detached from the flaps.
