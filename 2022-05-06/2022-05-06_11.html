     Summary: May 6 is National Nurses DayToday is National Nurses Day which means it’s time to show nurses how much you care about them.
Today actually kicks off National Nurses Week.
National Nurses Week ends on May 12, which is the birthday of Florence Nightingale: the founder of modern nursing.
A resolution was sent through the House of Representatives in 1972 to make “National Registered Nurse Day,” but that ended up falling through too.
It wasn’t until February 1974 when the White House and President Richard Nixon issued a proclamation to designate an official National Nuse Week.
