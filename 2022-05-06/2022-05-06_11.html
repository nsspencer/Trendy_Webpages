     Carlos Alcaraz overpowers idol Rafael Nadal at Madrid Open
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MADRID -- In a clash of generations, Spanish teenage sensation Carlos Alcaraz overcame an injury to defeat his idol Rafael Nadal 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 in the Madrid Open quarterfinals on Friday.
But Alcaraz lost momentum after needing medical attention for the ankle, losing 20 of the next 22 points as Nadal cruised through the second set.
The match also was interrupted in the second set after a fan became ill in the stands of the Caja Mágica center court.
Nadal's run was hampered by a rib stress fracture suffered in his semifinal win against Alcaraz in Indian Wells.
His other win against the ninth-ranked Alcaraz came in Madrid last year, when the youngster was just starting to attract everyone's attention.

     Rafael Nadal says injuries leave him in pain ‘every single day’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you see me every single day, you wouldn’t be worried.
I always have pain in my foot, especially after playing a three-hour match or a long training.
That’s part of my life, and that’s the downside of not being able to finish the match earlier.
In the short term, I think I am fine, physically speaking, but also, speaking about my feet, it has to adapt to competition.
Last year alone, Nadal suffered from a back injury at the start of the season and was then forced to miss the second half of 2021 with a foot injury.
