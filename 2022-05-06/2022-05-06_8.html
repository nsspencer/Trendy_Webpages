     Summary: This game will be made up as part of a split-admission doubleheader on August 20, which is the next and final time the Mets come back to Philadelphia this season.
Game 1 will occur at 1:05 p.m., while the originally scheduled contest is still set for 7:15 p.m.
The Mets and Phillies will hope to get tomorrow's game in since Philadelphia is traveling to Seattle following Sunday afternoon's series finale.
This would make a potential Mother's Day doubleheader extremely tricky from a logistical standpoint.
The Mets are 5-2 against the Phillies this season, and have the most wins in the major leagues with 19.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It could be worse.
After all, the Mets’ trade for Robinson Cano was — at its heart — Edwin Diaz for Jarred Kelenic.
And at this moment Diaz has never pitched better for the Mets while Kelenic is arguably the worst hitter to this point of a career in major league history (corroborating stat to come).
If Diaz closes out, say, a National League title this year before entering free agency, that would make the expense and embarrassment of having taken on Cano more worthwhile, and if Kelenic never blossoms into the touted star he was expected to be, then there will not be lingering Nolan Ryan sensations.
Here is what can never be fully known from the Mets’ perspective:
