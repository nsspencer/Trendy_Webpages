     Summary: I have been told that I am a pretty good cook, and the reason is mom.
Many an evening I laid on my stomach on the kitchen floor scanning baseball box scores in the newspaper while mom prepped supper.
Now at 67, I remember how important it was as a child just knowing mom was nearby.
That was 45 years ago, and mom tells me she still misses me.
Happy Mother’s Day, mom!

     Looking Back: Happy Mother’s Day!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Beginning in its first year of publication, Mother’s Day was a celebrated holiday in the Detroit Jewish Chronicle.
The current American Mother’s Day is credited to Anna Jarvis of West Virginia, who declared such a day in 1908.
Ironically, Jarvis later tried to remove Mother’s Day from the calendar because she thought it had become too commercial.
The first advertisement that promoted gifts for Mother’s Day was in the May 12, 1916, Chronicle.
Albert E. Sleeper’s Mother’s Day proclamation was published on the front page of that same issue.

     How Foster and Adoptive Families Observe Mother’s Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And some mothers are often overlooked—particularly birth mothers who aren’t actively parenting and foster mothers whose children are only temporarily in their care.
But Mother’s Day can also be a day of joy for adoptive and foster parents, birth parents, and adoptees, many of whose families were forged against all odds.
Here are a few reflections on Mother’s Day, as told by a birth mother, a foster mother, an adoptive mother, and an adoptee.
People will tell me “happy Mother’s Day,” and my husband and I might go out and do an activity for the day.
I don’t observe Birth Mother’s Day, which is the day before Mother’s Day.
