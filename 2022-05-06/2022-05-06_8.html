     Summary: MORE CORONAVIRUS COVID-19 COVERAGENEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- There are growing concerns as new data shows hospitalizations and deaths from COVID are tracking higher for the first time in months.
Limits now placed on Johnson &amp; Johnson are seen as good news for companies like Pfizer and Moderna.The FDA said Thursday that the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine should only be given to those who either don't have access to the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines or request only the J &amp; J shot.The recommendation was made after reports of rarely occurring but life-threatening blood clots that have appeared in the days or weeks after some have received the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot.Just days after New York City moved up to the medium COVID alert level , the health commissioner says the city is not ruling out the return of indoor mask mandates.
"Right now is the time, as we've moved into medium risk, where we're really encouraging New Yorkers to take more additional steps and use the myriad of tools that we have to manage their own risks, and also to manage the risk of those around them," said Dr. Ashwin Vasan, NYC Health Commissioner.
"We're also looking at our policies and seeing when we may want to bring back citywide policies, but now is not that time.
"The area is seeing some of its highest COVID rates in months.Right now, New Jersey has an alarming 13.41 positivity rate, as rates climb across the Tri-State.New York topped more than 10,000 cases a day for the first time in months, but that does not include the many who are testing positive at home.

     Summary: FDA Restricts Use Of J&amp;J Covid VaccineAfter review of rare cases of blood clots, the FDA limits the parameters for who can get Johnson &amp; Johnson's one-dose shot to adults who cannot get either of the approved mRNA covid vaccines.
Politico: FDA Dramatically Narrows Use Of Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 VaccineThe Food and Drug Administration has restricted the use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine to adults who are unable or unwilling to get the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA shots.
(Branswell, 5/5)AP: FDA Restricts J&amp;J's COVID-19 Vaccine Due To Blood Clot RiskThe Food and Drug Administration said the shot should only be given to adults who cannot receive a different vaccine or specifically request J&amp;J’s vaccine.
U.S. authorities for months have recommended that Americans get Pfizer or Moderna shots instead of J&amp;J’s vaccine.
FDA’s vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said the agency decided to restrict the vaccine after taking another look at the data on the risks of life-threatening blood clots and concluding that they are limited to J&amp;J’s vaccine.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. regulators on Thursday strictly limited who can receive Johnson &amp; Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine due to the ongoing risk of rare but serious blood clots.
U.S. authorities for months have recommended that Americans starting their COVID-19 vaccinations use the Pfizer or Moderna shots instead.
FDA officials said in a statement that they decided to restrict J&amp;J's vaccine after taking another look at data on the risk of life-threatening blood clots within two weeks of vaccination.
That amounts to one blood clot case per 3.23 million J&amp;J shots administered, the FDA said Thursday.
Additionally, regulators added warnings about the blood clots and a rare neurological reaction called Guillain-Barré syndrome.

     Summary: “We recognize that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine still has a role in the current pandemic response in the United States and across the global community.
The FDA says it has determined that the benefits of the J&amp;J vaccine outweigh the risks for certain people.
Both the CDC and the FDA previously recommended a pause in the use of this vaccine over reports of TTS.
The agency’s updated analysis of the vaccine includes cases reported to its Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database through March 18.
Overall, the risk of TTS is extremely rare: about three cases for every million doses of vaccine administered.

     Summary: SaveFDA restricts use of Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccineThe FDA has restricted the use of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine based on an updated analysis of the risk for a rare but potentially deadly blood-clotting syndrome.
The vaccine will be available only to people aged 18 years or older “for whom other authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate” or “who elect to receive the [vaccine] because they would otherwise not receive a COVID-19 vaccine,” the FDA said.
The CDC and FDA paused the rollout of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine last year over six cases of TTS that occurred out of the first 6.8 million doses of the vaccine administered in the United States.
The FDA’s most recent analysis of cases found that TTS occurs at a rate of 3.23 per million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine administered.
However, only around 3.2% of the more than 577 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered as of May 5 were the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot, which was developed by the company’s subsidiary, Janssen.

     Summary: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is limiting the use of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 vaccine as a last resort for adults who cannot accept a shot from another manufacturer.
Though the potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, the FDA said Thursday that it is restricting the use of the Janssen vaccine.
This leads to rare but potentially life-threatening blood clots, the FDA said, one to two weeks after receiving the shot.
In the release, the FDA said, "The factors that put an individual at risk for TTS following administration of Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine remain unknown."
The Janssen vaccine rollout was first paused last spring after six cases of the rare blood clots were reported.
