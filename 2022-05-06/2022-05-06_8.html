     Mixing Ibuprofen, Blood Pressure Meds May Damage Kidneys: Study
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: May 6, 2022 -- A study using computer-simulated drug trials found that people taking certain blood pressure medications along with painkillers such as ibuprofen may be risking kidney damage.
A research team at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, conducted computer-simulated drug trials to study the interactions of diuretics and RAS (renin-angiotensin system) inhibitors, which are often prescribed for people with high blood pressure, with ibuprofen, according to the study published in Mathematical Biosciences.
Ibuprofen is sold over the counter as a pain reliever.
In some cases, the combination of the three drugs “significantly” increased the risk of acute kidney injury -- what the study called a “triple whammy.” Using the three drugs was associated with a 31% increase in acute kidney damage compared to patients treated with two blood pressure drugs only, the study said.
“But the research shows it’s enough of a problem that you should exercise caution.”

     Research Reveals Why You Shouldn't Take Ibuprofen With Blood Pressure Meds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are new warnings being raised about combining ibuprofen with certain types of blood pressure medications.
A new report from The University of Waterloo suggests that combining ibuprofen with a diuretic and a renin-angiotensin system (RSA) inhibitor for high blood pressure could place people at risk for kidney disease.
But, she said the drug combination could be enough of a problem that people should exercise caution.
If you happen to be on these hypertension drugs and need a painkiller, consider acetaminophen instead.”Ibuprofen has been known to negatively impact other blood pressure medications, particularly ace inhibitors such as Vasotec or Lotensin, or beta-blockers like Lopressor.
The combination of ibuprofen with these drugs has been known to cause heartburn, upset stomach and even ulcers.

Image for illustration purposesMega Doctor NewsBy University of WaterlooNewswise — Anyone who is taking a diuretic and a renin-angiotensin system (RSA) inhibitor for high blood pressure should be cautious about also taking ibuprofen, according to new research.
Painkillers such as ibuprofen are available over-the-counter in most pharmacies and stores in popular brands.
They found that in people with certain medical profiles, the combination can cause acute kidney injury, which in some cases can be permanent.
“Being dehydrated is a major factor in acute kidney injury, and then the RAS inhibitor and ibuprofen hit the kidney with this triple whammy.
