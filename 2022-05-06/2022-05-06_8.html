     Claude Giroux a perfect fit with the Florida Panthers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE — When Claude Giroux was traded to the Florida Panthers, the assumption was he would play up on the top line with Sasha Barkov and that would be that.
On Thursday, the Panthers lined up for Game 2 against the Washington Capitals with Giroux — a certain future Hall of Famer — on their third line.
Giroux joined the Panthers in March, acquired in a blockbuster deal with the Philadelphia Flyers.
General manager Bill Zito said that the Panthers were certain Giroux was going to be a fit with his close-knit team before pulling the trigger on the deal.
In his final 18 regular season games with the Panthers, Giroux scored three goals with 23 points.

     Gary Bettman: Florida Panthers are growing hockey in South Florida
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE — NHL commissioner Gary Bettman gets booed just about every time he is publicly introduced at a hockey function.
Florida Panthers fans should consider ending that tradition, at least temporarily, next season when the NHL All-Star Weekend is held at whatever the arena in Sunrise will be named by then.
If not for Bettman, the Panthers may have packed up and left town long ago.
When asked if he felt like a “proud uncle” for how the Panthers have moved up in the marketplace, Bettman smiled.
Quenneville, Bettman said, would have to reach out if he wanted to meet.

Vanecek, who made 30 saves in Washington’s Game 1 win Tuesday, could very well be the starter Saturday, despite being pulled in Game 2.
1 goalie in the postseason, could go back to Vanecek for Game 3, though.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s getting spicy between the Florida Panthers and Washington Capitals in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
Florida struggled in Game 1 of the series, with goals from Sam Bennett and deadline acquisition Claude Giroux unable to lift them to victory.
Washington opened the postseason with an incredible road performance, scoring thrice in the final period to stun the Panthers in Game 1.
“We did just about everything right (to start the game) and we were down 2-0,” Laviolette said after Game 2.
Then they got a third and a fourth, and our game unravelled from there.”The timing and type of goals Vanecek conceded on Thursday night are concerning for Washington.

     Summary: SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — The bounce-back game that the Florida Panthers needed started, perhaps fittingly, with a puck that took a fortuitous bounce.
Aleksander Barkov and Carter Verhaeghe each had a goal and an assist and the Panthers beat the Washington Capitals 5-1 on Thursday night to even the Eastern Conference first-round series at a game apiece.
The series shifts to Washington, with Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday night.
“The first period, I thought we did just about everything right and we’re down 2-0,” Capitals coach Peter Laviolette said.
… Florida made one change from Game 1 to Game 2, putting Noel Acciari in the lineup for Ryan Lomberg.

     Summary: SUNRISE, Fla. — If three-time Stanley Cup winner Joel Quenneville is looking to return to coaching next season, he hasn’t told NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman of that plan.
And Bettman would certainly be in the loop on that news.
Part of the NHL-imposed conditions surrounding any plan Quenneville has to return to the league, if he chooses to do so, will be approval from Bettman.
“There’s nothing currently happening with Joel,” Bettman said.
Quenneville is the second-winningest coach in NHL history, his 969 victories trailing only the 1,244 amassed by Scotty Bowman.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Panthers began dominating after killing off a four-minute power play in the second period when the score was 2-1.
Panthers netminder Sergei Bobrovsky, who notoriously struggles in the playoffs, let in a soft goal from a bad angle early in the second period.
It was a New York Rangers franchise record and the second-most saves ever recorded in a single NHL game.
The superstar centre tied Steve Yzerman for 18th-most playoff goals in NHL history when he beat Shesterkin late in the second.
He and Ovechkin are the only active players with at least 70 playoff goals.
