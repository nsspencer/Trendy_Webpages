     Penguins’ Casey DeSmith done for Rangers series after surgery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rangers are expected to see more of Louis Domingue as their first-round playoff series shifts to Pittsburgh for Game 3 on Saturday.
Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said goalie Casey DeSmith will miss the remainder of the postseason after undergoing core muscle surgery Friday morning.
DeSmith departed the Penguins’ triple-overtime victory in Game 1 during the second extra session.
With regular-season starter Tristan Jarry sidelined with a broken foot, Domingue relieved DeSmith and made 17 saves in the series opener before Evgeni Malkin netted the game-winner in triple overtime.
The 30-year-old Domingue allowed five goals on 40 shots in the Rangers’ 5-2 victory in Game 2 at the Garden.

     Mark Madden: Goaltending leaves Penguins at grave disadvantage vs. Rangers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He’s not why the Penguins lost Game 2 at New York on Thursday.
• The Penguins need to get offense from somebody besides the line of Crosby, Jake Guentzel and Bryan Rust.
That line has four of the Penguins’ five even-strength goals on the series and provides most of their sustained pressure.
Letang and Matheson were not nearly as good in Game 2 as they were in Game 1.
But the sad fact remains: The goaltending matchup likely makes it impossible for the Penguins to win this series.

     Summary: The Texas Rangers will have to wait another day to try and extend their four-game winning streak.

     Summary: The Pittsburgh Penguins fell 5-2 to the New York Rangers in Game 2 of the first round, evening the series 1-1.
The Penguins have been lucky to get great performances from Brian Boyle and Jeff Carter for stretches of this season.
However, in this series, Boyle seems to be a step behind the quick-footed New York Rangers.
While Carter hasn't directly been costing the Penguins goals, his lack of production is stalling his linemates in this series.
Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan has always been loyal to his players, and that may continue with Boyle and Carter.

     Offense and Igor Shesterkin outweigh defensive issues as Rangers even series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are a few reasons to think the Rangers won’t be able to tighten up the way Gallant wants the rest of this series.
The Rangers had no answers for Crosby for a second straight game.
With Ryan Lindgren (lower body) a late scratch, the Rangers were trying to defend Pittsburgh’s top forwards with essentially three defensemen.
The Rangers still were a bit stubborn with the puck for stretches of Game 2, and Gallant seemed most frustrated by that.
The coach won’t like it and Shesterkin may need a few days on his couch when it’s over, but the Rangers can win this series without needing their best defensive effort.
