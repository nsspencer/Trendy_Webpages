    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Through two games in the Mavericks second round series with the Phoenix Suns, one of the major talking points was Luka Doncic and the Mavericks offense.
If there was any adjustment to make going into Game 3, it was the Mavericks defense, which had carried them for long stretches of this season, finding a pulse.
So in the biggest game of the season, to keep the season alive, the Mavericks defense came through.
Phoenix scored 94 points in the Mavericks Game 3 win, the lowest point total for the Suns so far this postseason.
In those previous two games, the Suns shot a staggering 57 percent (45-of-79) on those very same shots.
