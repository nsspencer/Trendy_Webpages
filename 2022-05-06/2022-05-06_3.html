     Summary: Cale Makar and the Colorado Avalanche go up two-nil in the series against the Nashville Predators.
The Avalanche came into the game firing on all cylinders, but the Predators were ready for it this time.
The rookie Connor Ingram had a spectacular game and kept Nashville in it all night.
At the end of the night, Cale Makar’s talent was too much to overcome and he went five-hole on Ingram to give the Avalanche the OT win.

     Smashville is toast. Cale Makar is the jam. If Avalanche "keep working," Predators will need help from hockey gods to prevent sweep.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And, eventually, most of the time, the hockey gods are going to reward you for that hard work.”Most of the time.
But if there was ever a game to steal, a chance to make this series interesting, it was Thursday night.
And the stingier Ingram got, the more Avs shots that went for naught, the more ripe this one looked for petty thievery.
“He was definitely ready to go,” Colorado goalie Darcy Kuemper, who turned away 25 of 26 Preds shots, said of his counterpart, “(and) made it tough on our shooters.
These days, whenever Makar gets rolling, even the hockey gods stop and doff their caps.

     Summary: If the Avalanche win the Stanley Cup, it will continue a tradition of Colorado’s best teams learning from their losses.
Instead, the Broncos lost in the divisional round to second year franchise, the Jacksonville Jaguars.
This time led by Peyton Manning, the Broncos lost to the Ravens in heartbreaking fashion.
The above-mentioned Avalanche and Broncos teams featured great players whose legacies were made in those Stanley Cup and Super Bowl seasons.
The way the Avalanche lost will always leave a bad taste in the mouth of players and fans.

     Ingram makes 49 saves, gives Predators chance in Game 2 loss to Avalanche
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Video: NSH@COL: Ingram makes 49 saves in Game 2 lossNot long ago, Ingram was unsure he would get a chance to play again, let alone in a situation like this.
But he started three games for the Predators, going 1-2-0 with a 3.71 GAA and .879 save percentage.
Each goal Ingram allowed went in off a teammate.
"He made a nice play," Ingram said.
I think that's part of maturing with age is just being able to move on and kind of reset and go from there.
