     Charles Oliveira Stripped Of UFC Title After Missing Weight By Half A Pound
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charles Oliveira was set to defend his UFC lightweight title against Justin Gaethje this weekend in Phoenix, and while the two men will still fight, only Gaethje will be eligible to win the belt.
Oliveira lost his title after he missed weight by half a pound, first at the official weigh-ins, then again by the same margin one hour later.
This is now the fourth time Oliveira has missed weight in his professional MMA career; the previous three instances were at featherweight, so this is the first time he failed to make 155 pounds.
Oliveira’s coach Diego Lima posted Thursday night that his fighter was already on weight, and indeed, Oliveira seemed shocked to have missed weight on the first go-round.
UFC weigh-in rules allow fighters in non-championship fights to exceed their division’s weight limit by one pound, while championship fighters must come in at or under their division’s limit.

     ‘This is a disgrace’: MMA world reacts to Charles Oliveira missing weight, being stripped of UFC title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charles Oliveira is no longer the UFC lightweight champion after losing the battle with the scale.
Shortly after his second attempt, it was announced that the lightweight title is vacated and only Gaethje is eligible to win it Saturday.
This is not the first time that Oliveira has had difficulty at the scale, though his previous misses came when he was competing as a featherweight.
1 fighter at 155 pounds in MMA Fighting’s Global Rankings — has won 10 straight fights at lightweight, capturing the UFC title with a TKO win over Michael Chandler at UFC 262 and then successfully defending it against Dustin Poirier at UFC 269.
But thinking you’re on weight, then missing weight, just to have to go lose more weight after you’ve lost your initial sweat is a living nightmare both physically and mentally.
