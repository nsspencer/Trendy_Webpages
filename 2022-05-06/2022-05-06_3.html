Social media is the variable that makes our perception different.
It intensifies things that previously would not have been so intensified.
Chris Rock is belted at the Oscars by Will Smith after a joke at the expense of Smith’s wife.
Then this week, Dave Chappelle is tackled on stage during his "Netflix is a Joke" show at the Hollywood Bowl.

     Will Smith’s Next Awards Contender Will Reportedly Be Pushed to 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More than a month after the slap that got him banned from the Oscars for a decade, Will Smith is still considered persona non grata in Hollywood.
After he assaulted Chris Rock because of an ill-advised joke made against his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, many of Smith’s future projects appeared to be in flux.
Now, the film that was set to be his awards-season follow-up is reportedly being pushed to next year.
Directed by Antoine Fuqua, the film was expected to be a repeat awards contender for both Smith, who won best actor for King Richard, and distributor Apple, hot off its best-picture win for CODA.
However, Smith’s interview was reportedly filmed prior to the Oscars.

     Apple TV+ film Emancipation reportedly moving to 2023 release after Will Smith slap incident
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Heading into 2022, Apple TV+ was preparing to fill its original film slate with a major blockbuster original film, ‘Emancipation’, directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Will Smith.
Although Apple has never officially given a release timeframe to Emancipation before, it was widely expected to be one of Apple’s awards darlings for the upcoming circuit, with a release in the fall.
This follows Apple Original Film’s achievement of getting Best Picture recognition within its first two years of eligibility, making Apple TV+ the first streaming service ever to pick up the Oscar’s highest accolade.
As soon as that happened, the awards prospects for Emancipation — particularly whilst the incident remains in recent memory — evaporated.
Variety says that post-production on the film is still ongoing, which is another possible factor as to the schedule pushback.

     Will Smith-Led 'Emancipation' Delayed to 2023 on Apple TV+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reported exclusively by Variety, the Smith-led Apple film Emancipation has been delayed until 2023, making it the latest Smith film to be affected by that night.
Apple has not confirmed a date or the news, but one of Variety’s sources said that “it’s the unspoken truth” that the thriller would not hit Apple TV+ later this year.
The film originally delayed its production to move shooting locations from Georgia to Louisiana to protest the voting restriction laws in the state.
Then the film was delayed again due to the destruction caused by Hurricane Ida and COVID cases in August 2021.
Emancipation has so much talent both behind and in front of the camera, so hopefully the film can release sooner rather than later.
