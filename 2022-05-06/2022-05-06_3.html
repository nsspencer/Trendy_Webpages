     UFC Champion Fails To Make Weight, Stripped Ot Title Ahead Of PPV Fight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UFC lightweight champion Charles Oliveira was stripped of his title after failing to make weight for his main event title defense against Justin Gaethje at UFC 274.
Oliveira weighed in at 155.5 lbs during Friday's (May 6) weigh-in, a half-pound over the limit for a lightweight title bout, vacating the title, ESPN reports.
He was then allowed an additional hour to cut weight, but once again missed the mark upon returning.
Gaethje came in at 155 lbs during Friday's weigh-in.
Norma Dumont also missed weight on Friday by half a pound, which will levy a 30% fine of her purse in her fight against Macy Chiasson during the pay-per-view's undercard on Saturday night.

     UFC Champion Stripped Of Title Belt: Fans React
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The UFC stripped Charles Oliveira of his lightweight title on Friday because he missed weight.
Some UFC fans are frustrated that Oliveira was stripped of his title in this fashion.
"I think it is such BS to completely strip him of his title when he earned it over .5 pounds," a UFC fan tweeted.
If Oliveira wins on Saturday, he'll become the No.
On the flip side, if Gaethje wins, he'll leave UFC 274 as the champion.

     UFC 274: Charles Oliveira misses weight, vacates lightweight title ahead of Justin Gaethje fight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One day before he was set to defend his lightweight championship against Justin Gaethje, Charles Oliveira missed weight by half a pound twice and vacated his title ahead of UFC 274.
Oliveira weighed in at 155 1/2 pounds on two tries an hour apart on Friday.
Gaethje, who weighed in at 155 pounds, can still win the now-vacant title by defeating Oliveira on Saturday.
Oliveira, 32, had held the lightweight championship since beating Michael Chandler in May 2021 at UFC 262.
Gaethje, 33, is fighting for a title for the first time since he lost to Khabib Nurmagomedov by technical submission in October 2020 at UFC 254.
