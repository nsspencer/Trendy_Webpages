     Will Smith’s Next Awards Contender Will Reportedly Be Pushed to 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More than a month after the slap that got him banned from the Oscars for a decade, Will Smith is still considered persona non grata in Hollywood.
After he assaulted Chris Rock because of an ill-advised joke made against his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, many of Smith’s future projects appeared to be in flux.
Now, the film that was set to be his awards-season follow-up is reportedly being pushed to next year.
Directed by Antoine Fuqua, the film was expected to be a repeat awards contender for both Smith, who won best actor for King Richard, and distributor Apple, hot off its best-picture win for CODA.
However, Smith’s interview was reportedly filmed prior to the Oscars.

     Apple TV+ film Emancipation reportedly moving to 2023 release after Will Smith slap incident
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Heading into 2022, Apple TV+ was preparing to fill its original film slate with a major blockbuster original film, ‘Emancipation’, directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Will Smith.
Although Apple has never officially given a release timeframe to Emancipation before, it was widely expected to be one of Apple’s awards darlings for the upcoming circuit, with a release in the fall.
This follows Apple Original Film’s achievement of getting Best Picture recognition within its first two years of eligibility, making Apple TV+ the first streaming service ever to pick up the Oscar’s highest accolade.
As soon as that happened, the awards prospects for Emancipation — particularly whilst the incident remains in recent memory — evaporated.
Variety says that post-production on the film is still ongoing, which is another possible factor as to the schedule pushback.

     Will Smith-Led 'Emancipation' Delayed to 2023 on Apple TV+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reported exclusively by Variety, the Smith-led Apple film Emancipation has been delayed until 2023, making it the latest Smith film to be affected by that night.
Apple has not confirmed a date or the news, but one of Variety’s sources said that “it’s the unspoken truth” that the thriller would not hit Apple TV+ later this year.
The film originally delayed its production to move shooting locations from Georgia to Louisiana to protest the voting restriction laws in the state.
Then the film was delayed again due to the destruction caused by Hurricane Ida and COVID cases in August 2021.
Emancipation has so much talent both behind and in front of the camera, so hopefully the film can release sooner rather than later.

     Will Smith Movie Emancipation Gets Shifted to 2023 at Apple TV+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While many Will Smith films have been shelved, Emancipation at Apple TV+ will still be coming out, just a bit later than expected.
He's set to star in the upcoming Apple TV+ movie Emancipation, and while that film was originally set to arrive this fall, it has been pushed back to 2023 with an exact date yet to be announced, per Variety.
Emancipation getting delayed is better news than for the film's release to be outright canceled.
The Netflix movie Fast and Loose is another Smith film that's said to be on pause indefinitely.
Meanwhile, Smith's next on-screen appearance will be for David Letterman's Netflix talk show, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman.

     Will Smith’s ‘Emancipation’ Shifting to 2023, Apple Eyes New Date After Slap (EXCLUSIVE)

     Summary: Don’t expect an “Emancipation” for Oscar winner Will Smith in 2022.
Directed by Antoine Fuqua (“Training Day”), the movie would have been the first release for Smith following his assault on comedian Chris Rock during the 94th Oscars.
As a result, he was banned from attending the Oscars and other Academy-related events for 10 years.
In addition, Apple has several undated films expected, notably Martin Scorsese’s “The Killers of the Flower Moon” with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jesse Plemons.
Apple Original Films had no comment.

     Will Smith film Emancipation pushed to 2023 by Apple in the wake of Slapgate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple is delaying the release of Will Smith's next film, Emancipation, in the wake of his now infamous slapping of Chris Rock during the Oscars, it was revealed on Friday.
The Antoine Fuqua directed movie was already getting awards buzz prior to this year's Oscars but Smith's on-camera assaulting of Chris Rock sent the studio into damage control.
The 53-year-old's performance was expected to earn him an Oscar nod - but that was prior to the 2022 ceremony where he slapped Chris Rock on stage.
Apple bought the rights to the movie for $105million after Smith and Fuqua had signed on.
Regrettably, we feel compelled to move our film production work from Georgia to another state,' the pair said.
