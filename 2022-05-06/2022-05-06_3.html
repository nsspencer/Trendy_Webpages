     No, dating nonbinary rapper G Flip does not make Selling Sunset’s Chrishell Stause a lesbian. Here’s why
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since many people struggle to understand non-binary gender identities, it can be helpful to see the term as an “anti-label.” This is who I am not, it announces.
While G Flip theirself hasn’t gone into a lot of detail about how they do experience gender, they have dropped some clues.
“If strawberries were girls and blueberries were boys and you put them in a blender, you’d get a gender smoothie.
I am a gender smoothie,” G Flip elaborated last week, seeming to indicate that their gender experience is multifaceted and complex, encompassing elements of masculinity, femininity, and possibly even neutrality.
Non-binary people struggle with widespread misunderstanding of their gender experiences and expressions, and G Flip taps seamlessly into the resulting exasperation.
