     Prime Video’s Entertaining The Wilds Gets a Little Lost in Second Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The girls who survived the crash had been placed there and monitored by the kooky head of the Dawn of Eve program, Gretchen Klein (Rachel Griffiths).
That’s where we meet young men like the charismatic Raf (Zack Calderon), alpha male Kirin (Charles Alexander), and outgoing Josh (Nicholas Coombe).
Largely through no fault of the young cast, the male characters in season two just aren't as richly drawn as the female ones in the first season.
Part of it could because of the crowded plotting with two less episodes and twice the characters.
That’s not the case here, but there are a few stand-outs: Miles Gutierrez-Riley and Alex Fitzalan feel like future stars.

     The Wilds Has A Major Cliffhanger To Resolve In A Potential Season 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After introducing a new all-male crew of teen castaways in Season 2, The Wilds ended on a major cliffhanger involving their stranded female counterparts.
As “Phase 3” had just officially begun on screen — and a shocking mole was revealed — it only seems natural that The Wilds Season 3 would follow as well.
The Wilds Season 3 Premiere DateThe inaugural season of The Wilds debuted about a year and a half after Amazon gave the series a 10-episode order in May 2019.
If production continues to follow the same pattern, viewers can likely expect The Wilds Season 3 to premiere in late 2023.
“I mean, she lost her hand.”This post will be updated as more details about The Wilds Season 3 become available.

     'The Wilds' Season 2: Breaking Down the "I Love You" Scene with Mia Healey &amp; Erana James
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [Editor's note: The following contains spoilers for The Wilds, Season 2, Episode 6, “46/26.”]There were many elements of The Wilds Season 1 that I was eager to see progress in the second season, but one of the things at the top of that list was the relationship between Erana James’ Toni and Mia Healey’s Shelby.
In Season 1, initial tensions between the two give way to the show’s fan-favorite romance.
Their relationship continues to grow stronger and stronger in Season 2 until some game-changing words are said.
Healey began:“At the beginning of Season 2 we see Shelby as the happiest we’ve ever seen her.
James offered up some insight into her approach to crafting that specific reaction:“It’s so heartbreaking I think.

She tried a girls' island, she tried a boys' island.
And in terms of the moles, look, I think Gretchen tries to convince Leah to her side.
I think as season 2 was starting to develop, we started to be like, "Oh, that's where we're going."
