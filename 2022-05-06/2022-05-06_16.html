     Avalanche vs. Nashville Predators Game 3: Three keys to victory for Colorado
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The third game of the Colorado Avalanche’s first-round playoff series against the Nashville Predators turns to Music City.
The Predators will play before a large party in Nashville, one of the toughest buildings in the league for visiting opponents.
Nashville blocked an incredible 34 shots in Game 2.
Colorado doesn’t want Ingram to gain any more confidence that he can steal a game — as he nearly did in Game 2.
Forsberg plays on a stellar line with center Mikail Granlund and Matt Duchene, and Granlund had two assists on Duchene’s goals in Game 1.

     Summary: And, eventually, most of the time, the hockey gods are going to reward you for that hard work.”Most of the time.
But if there was ever a game to steal, a chance to make this series interesting, it was Thursday night.
And the stingier Ingram got, the more Avs shots that went for naught, the more ripe this one looked for petty thievery.
“He was definitely ready to go,” Colorado goalie Darcy Kuemper, who turned away 25 of 26 Preds shots, said of his counterpart, “(and) made it tough on our shooters.
These days, whenever Makar gets rolling, even the hockey gods stop and doff their caps.

“For us, we were able to get a lucky one in overtime.”The series moves to Nashville for Game 3 on Saturday.
He allowed MacKinnon's goal on the first shot of the game and turned back everything until Makar's goal.
The 25-year-old Ingram relieved David Rittich in the first game after the Avalanche scored five first-period goals.
The best scoring chance was Makar on a breakaway, only to have his shot land in the glove of Ingram.

     Summary: I wanted to wait and see which Nashville Predators team came out of the locker room to start the game.
The question was whether or not the team that came out to start the first period followed that game plan.
My biggest complaint was that the Predators didn’t seem to ever get set up on either of the power plays.
Oh, and Connor Ingram got the start in net and looked cool, calm, and collected.

It’s not even close.” – Greg Carvel after UMass advanced to the Frozen FourThe 2018-19 UMass hockey season was something alumni like me could have only dreamed of.
Scoring or assisting on goals in big moments moved from a surprise to the expectation, as it became clear that the Avs new star was a rookie in name only.
