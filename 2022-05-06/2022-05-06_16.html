     FDA Restricts Who Can Receive Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration placed limits Thursday on who can receive Johnson &amp; Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine, saying only certain adults should get the shot because of the potential for rare blood clots.
The agency said only adults who cannot or will not get the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines should receive the J&amp;J shot, citing new data showing a risk of ‘life-threatening blood clots.’Though some Americans sought out the J&amp;J vaccine because it only required one dose, there has been an ongoing conversation about the shot’s efficacy and risks.
The FDA’s announcement follows a December recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control that Americans get the Pfizer or Moderna shots instead of J&amp;J’s vaccine.

     Summary: CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WVIR) -The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has put a limit on the use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.
You can only get the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID vaccine if you are 18 or older and unable to get Pfizer or Moderna’s mRNA shots.
One UVA Health doctor says the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot is still a useful tool to have.
The Blue Ridge Health District no longer offers the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot.
According to UVA Health’s website it is still currently offering the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.

     Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine Restricted Due to Clotting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The reason, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA﻿) noted in its announcement, is due to a rare but potentially life-threatening complication called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, which was first linked to the J&amp;J vaccine in the spring of 2021.
About 3.23 cases of TTS have been reported per 1 million J&amp;J doses; some have been fatal.
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are made using the mRNA technology, which is different from the J&amp;J product.
TTS is a rare but ongoing issueWhen cases of TTS first surfaced last spring, health officials paused the use of the J&amp;J vaccine to review its safety, eventually determining that its benefits outweighed any risks.
The vast majority of vaccinated Americans have been inoculated with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which studies show are more effective against COVID-19 and have not been linked to TTS.

     Summary: COLORADO SPRINGS — The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has limited the authorized use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine due to rare blood clots.
After evaluating reported cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS), the FDA has warned against the use of Johnson &amp; Johnson for certain individuals.
Providers in Colorado have administered over 317,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine since Feb. 2021.
Coloradans who received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, are encouraged to receive a dose of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) two months or more after they first got vaccinated, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health &amp; Environment (CDPHE).
If individuals got the Johnson &amp; Johnson for their first and second doses, CDPHE says they can receive a third dose (second booster) of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) four months after.

     Summary: Federal regulators are limiting the use of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine to cases where mRNA vaccines aren’t an option.
An exception will be made if an adult elects to receive the J&amp;J shot and would otherwise not receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
After further review by the CDC’s advisory committee, and time for physicians to learn how to treat the condition, regulators allowed use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to resume.
Among them, 393,366 residents received a Johnson &amp; Johnson shot, including only 10,221 since Jan. 1.
