     Smashville is toast. Cale Makar is the jam. If Avalanche "keep working," Predators will need help from hockey gods to prevent sweep.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And, eventually, most of the time, the hockey gods are going to reward you for that hard work.”Most of the time.
But if there was ever a game to steal, a chance to make this series interesting, it was Thursday night.
And the stingier Ingram got, the more Avs shots that went for naught, the more ripe this one looked for petty thievery.
“He was definitely ready to go,” Colorado goalie Darcy Kuemper, who turned away 25 of 26 Preds shots, said of his counterpart, “(and) made it tough on our shooters.
These days, whenever Makar gets rolling, even the hockey gods stop and doff their caps.

     Summary: Video: NSH@COL: Ingram makes 49 saves in Game 2 lossNot long ago, Ingram was unsure he would get a chance to play again, let alone in a situation like this.
But he started three games for the Predators, going 1-2-0 with a 3.71 GAA and .879 save percentage.
Each goal Ingram allowed went in off a teammate.
"He made a nice play," Ingram said.
I think that's part of maturing with age is just being able to move on and kind of reset and go from there.
