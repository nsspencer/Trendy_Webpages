     Lewis Hamilton unhappy with F1 ban on jewelry, but removes earrings despite threats to sit out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hamilton will now remove his ear piercings for this weekend hours after indicating he was willing to sit out the Miami Grand Prix in defiance of F1's rules.
I've been in the sport for 16 years, I've been wearing jewelry for 16 years.
In the car I only ever have my earrings on and my nose ring, of which I can't even remove.
Hamilton's being at-odds with FIA officials over the jewelry ban presents an off-track distraction from what has been a terrible start to the 2022 season for the seven-time world champion.
Hamilton enters Miami seventh in the championship standings, a full 58 points back of Charles Leclerc.

     Summary: Lewis Hamilton speaks about Formula One's ban on piercings and jewellery for drivers.
In Miami, the FIA banned jewellery under a scrutineering declaration form distributed to all teams and has clarified which clothing drivers must wear underneath their overalls for safety reasons.
Lewis Hamilton joked during Friday's press conference he could not have worn any more jewellery.
"I've been in the sport for 16 years and I've been wearing jewellery for 16 years.
I do feel like its personal, we should have the freedom to do what we feel is right for us.

     Summary: If one could only use one word to describe the Miami Grand Prix racetrack, it’s hot.
In F1 news today, the fake marina at the Miami Grand Prix track now has fake water added.
“It was a tricky one I found,” said Williams F1 driver Alex Albon prior to practice.
There is a big difference between Friday and Saturday in an F1 weekend, but the big thing Mercedes hasn’t had this year has been raw speed.
The Miami Grand Prix will be held at 3:30 p.m.

     Summary: “It reminds me of being in a B&amp;Q car park when I was six years old/seven years old, in a go kart, going in between cars.
“There were frigging big, big, big bumps and so many places where the track like joins up with somewhere else.
It meant that if drivers did stray off the racing line then they were almost guaranteed to spin.
“It’s a shame, because I think the racing will be bad due to that.
“It is not an easy track for sure,” he told Motorsport.com.

     Russell ‘doesn’t really understand’ Mercedes’ improved F1 pace
    </h2>

     Summary: Mercedes brought a raft of updates for its car to Miami, including a low-drag rear wing and a revised front wing endplate design.
While Russell warned the updates would provide no “silver bullet” to cure Mercedes’ struggles, he managed to finish second in FP1 before setting the fastest time of the day in FP2.
But Russell warned it was “absolutely” too early for people to get ahead of themselves about Mercedes’ pace, admitting he was unsure why he had been so quick out of the blocks.
“I don’t really understand it, to be honest, why we hit the ground running,” Russell said.
“When I got out of FP1, I was straight into the stewards’ office because of the pitlane incident with [Esteban] Ocon,” Russell said.

     F1 touches down in US for Miami GP amid undercurrent of controversy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Really, you’d be hard pressed to find a more postcard-perfect venue for an F1 race.
“This is environmental racism,” Ferguson declared, “pure and simple.”Last May a recall election was sought to remove council members who voted to bring the race to Miami Gardens.
What’s more, Miami Gardens residents are locked into this deal for a decade, with F1 president Stefano Domenicali promising to leave “a positive and lasting contribution for the people in the local community”.
It’s an undercurrent of controversy that puts Miami squarely in league with Sochi, Saudi Arabia and other dubious F1 crash pads.
So it figures that a Grand Prix would finally wind up here.

Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Erik JuniusHamilton has said the W13 “is not far off” the 2009 McLaren - the machine in which he won twice to end his first title defence in fifth - as the worst F1 car he has driven over a season.
