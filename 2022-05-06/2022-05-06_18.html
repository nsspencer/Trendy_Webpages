     Todd Boehly-Led Group Has Signed Contract to Buy Chelsea From Abramovich, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the club has seen weeks of tumult following the ousting of longtime owner Roman Abramovich, Chelsea F.C.
A group led by Todd Boehly, a part-owner of MLB’s Dodgers, has reportedly signed a contract to purchase the club, according to multiple reports.
Mark Walter, the Dodgers’ principal owner, is also part of the group.
He owns stakes in the Dodgers, Lakers and Sparks, and had previously tried to buy Chelsea in 2019.
Chelsea was up for bid after the Premier League disqualified Roman Abramovich as owner of the club for his ties to Vladimir Putin after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

     Who is Todd Boehly? Dodgers co-owner behind record purchase of Chelsea FC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dodgers owners Robert Patton, left, Stan Kasten, Mark Walter, Magic Johnson, Peter Guber and Todd Boehly at Dodger Stadium on May 2, 2012.
Mark Walter, the Dodgers principal owner (who also reportedly joined Boehly’s bid for Chelsea), was the company’s chief executive.
Together, they provided significant financial backing to an ownership group that also included Magic Johnson and several other businessmen.
Walter and Boehly each put up $100 million personally to buy the team, while $1.213 billion came from Guggenheim Partners insurance companies controlled by Walter.
“There is only one Dodgers,” Boehly said after the purchase of the team.

     Todd Boehly-led group agrees deal to buy Chelsea Football Club
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Chelsea Football Club announced Friday that terms have been agreed for a new ownership group, led by Todd Boehly, to buy the club in a deal worth more than $5 billion.
Boehly owns stakes in the MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers, the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers and the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks.
UK government approval would be required for the proceeds to be transferred from the frozen UK bank account, the club added.
It said the proposed new owners would also "commit 1.75 billion pounds ($2.16 billion) in further investment for the benefit of the club".
The announcement of the Boehly deal comes with just over three weeks remaining on the club's current operating licence, which expires on May 31.

     Chelsea: Todd Boehly consortium signs £4.25bn agreement to buy club
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea have confirmed Todd Boehly’s consortium has agreed terms to buy the Premier League club from Roman Abramovich in a £4.25 billion takeover.
Abramovich put the club up for sale in March and was then sanctioned by the UK government following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The club added: “The sale is expected to be complete in late May subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.
And the sale of the club is still subject to the Premier League's owners’ and directors’ test.
The agreement means Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner Boehly, who is expected to attend Chelsea’s match against Wolves at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, has won an exceptionally dramatic and public race to buy the Premier League club.
