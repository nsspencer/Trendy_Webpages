     Claude Giroux a perfect fit with the Florida Panthers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE — When Claude Giroux was traded to the Florida Panthers, the assumption was he would play up on the top line with Sasha Barkov and that would be that.
On Thursday, the Panthers lined up for Game 2 against the Washington Capitals with Giroux — a certain future Hall of Famer — on their third line.
Giroux joined the Panthers in March, acquired in a blockbuster deal with the Philadelphia Flyers.
General manager Bill Zito said that the Panthers were certain Giroux was going to be a fit with his close-knit team before pulling the trigger on the deal.
In his final 18 regular season games with the Panthers, Giroux scored three goals with 23 points.

     Dave Hyde: Sergei Bobrovsky quiets concerns to carry Florida Panthers in pivotal Game 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Advertisement“[Bobrovsky] was really good, really solid, gave us a chance to get our game,” Panthers coach Andrew Brunette said.
The night, maybe the season, didn’t splinter because Bobrovsky didn’t.
Due to that past and his position’s importance, Bobrovsky was the prime Panthers player with a spotlight on him these playoffs.
Washington star Alex Ovechkin, a fellow Russian, made a point to talk at Bobrovsky during Thursday’s game, needling him in some form.
Washington didn’t score as Bobrovsky had a couple of key saves.

Mason Marchment with a response goal for the Florida Panthers pic.twitter.com/BrNWllGtRq — Shayna (@hayyyshayyy) May 6, 2022“That was kind of tough, actually, mentally,” Backstrom said of Florida’s third goal.
Laviolette said Friday morning that Washington will have to “evaluate everything” from Game 2, including a possible change in net.
Vanecek, who made 30 saves in Washington’s Game 1 win Tuesday, could very well be the starter Saturday, despite being pulled in Game 2.
His solid third period Thursday could help put him in the right head space for a possible Game 3 start.

     Giroux proves good fit with Panthers, could be key to winning Stanley Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE, Fla. -- One significant difference in Claude Giroux's new hockey life with the Florida Panthers was demonstrated in a recent text to former Philadelphia Flyers teammate Scott Laughton.
For Giroux, it was about having the chance to play in the Stanley Cup Playoffs and win the Cup for the first time in his 15-season NHL career.
Giroux has been chasing the Stanley Cup long enough to know each playoff experience should be cherished.
Giroux scored two points (one goal, one assist) in his first two playoff games with the Panthers.
Though Giroux was unable to win the Stanley Cup in Philadelphia, he left behind an indisputable legacy.
