     Fortnite becomes first free-to-play title on Xbox Cloud Gaming
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The videogame Fortnite has become the free-to-play title to be made available on Xbox Cloud Gaming, meaning it can be played on a PC or phone web browser.
The launch, in partnership with videogame publisher Epic, represents a significant milestone in Microsoft’s investment in cloud gaming.
In a post on the Xbox website, Catherine Gluckstein, vice president and head of product for Xbox Cloud Gaming, explains: “As we look to make gaming more accessible to even more people, and reach the three billion players globally, we’ve invested heavily in the cloud – both for players so they can play the way they want, and for creators so they engage new, larger audiences and build, run and manage their games using best-in-class cloud tools and services.
We’ve built this in partnership with Azure, which reaches more people than any other cloud provider.”Gluckstein adds that since launching in 2020, more than 10 million people have streamed games through the service, and “players across all 26 countries have played on more than 6,000 types of devices, from various flavours of Android phones to a range of PCs and iPhones from all generations”.
