     Charles Oliveira misses weight for UFC 274, will vacate lightweight title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a stunning turn of events Friday, Oliveira missed weight on his first and second attempts.
As a result, he was forced to vacate the title entering his UFC 274 headliner against Justin Gaethje.
Oliveira, who missed weight multiple times while competing as a featherweight, hadn't missed weight since returning to lightweight in April 2017.
Just minutes before UFC 274 weigh-ins began, Oliveira tweeted that he was already on weight.
UFC 274, which takes place Saturday at Footprint Center, has a main card airing on pay-per-view following prelims on ESPN and ESPN+.

     Charles Oliveira Stripped of Title After Weigh-in for UFC 274
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saturday night’s UFC 274 lightweight title fight just got a whole lot more interesting (or less interesting, depending on what side you’re on).
The fight will still take place, but only one fighter, Gaethje, will be eligible for the title after Oliveira missed weight on Friday afternoon.
In a stunning turn of events, only Gaethje can win the lightweight title in a match that will still go on as scheduled on Saturday night.
This is an unprecedented moment in UFC history on the men’s side, as this is the first time in the UFC’s existence that a belt-holder has missed weight ahead of a title fight.
Montaño was stripped of the title after the fight was cancelled.

     UFC 274: Charles Oliveira swallows bitter pill as weight-cutting issues resurface
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What is strange is that Oliveira didn’t make every last-ditch effort he could to make it.
It’s an extraordinarily difficult task to drop more weight after you’ve stopped sweating, but Oliveira didn’t shave his head, for instance.
Rest assured, Oliveira didn’t have bacon and eggs with rye toast for breakfast on Friday before the weigh-in.
If he doesn’t get another title fight, that’s going to cost him countless dollars.
UFC fighters have their greatest earning potential A) As champions and B) as challengers in title fights.
