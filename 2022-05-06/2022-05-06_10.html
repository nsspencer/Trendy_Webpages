     Goaltender Connor Ingram in line to start Game 3 as Nashville Predators rule Juuse Saros out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Predators coach John Hynes has ruled goaltender Juuse Saros out for Game 3 of Nashville's series with the Colorado Avalanche.
Ingram stopped 49 of 51 shots in Game 2, after the Avalanche lit up David Rittich for five goals on 13 shots in the series opener.
Saros exited a 5-4 loss to the Calgary Flames in the third period with an apparent left foot injury.
Nashville's trainer looked at Saros' injured ankle, and the goalie left the ice without putting any weight on his left foot.
He finished 38-25-3 in 67 starts, the most for any goalie in the league, and played in his first All-Star Game.

     Boulding: Singular Focus is Avalanche Key to Success

     Summary: #Preds Head Coach John Hynes says goaltender Juuse Saros (lower-body) “will not be in” for Game 3.
#StanleyCup — Brooks Bratten (@brooksbratten) May 6, 2022The Avalanche are focused on the singular purpose of winning the Stanley Cup, and very little can get in the way of that.
“We’ve already gone over Rittich, and we’ve gone over Ingram,” head coach Jared Bednar said Friday of preparations for Game 3.
I can safely say, in my years with and around the franchise, I’ve never seen an Avalanche team so dedicated to that end.
But it’s the bond that forms from shared goals, grouped beliefs, unified trust, and the unforgettable sting of unmet expectations and falling short that informs Colorado’s singular focus.
