    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stanley Cup Playoff crowds are notorious for being more raucous than the NHL's regular-season audiences.
The TD Garden crowd brought that notion to life during Game 3 of the Boston Bruins' first-round playoff series against the Carolina Hurricanes on Friday, leading to a scary injury.
The panel hit timeout coordinator Joe Foley in the head, causing him to collapse.
The NHL discourages fans from banging on the glass because it could cause dangerous situations like the one Foley found himself in Friday.
