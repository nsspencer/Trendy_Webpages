     Selling Sunset Reunion: Chrishell Reveals Her New Romance After Jason Split
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The buzzy interoffice relationship between Chrishell Stause and Jason Oppenheim was at the forefront of Selling Sunset season 5.
But the show’s reunion special, out Friday, revealed that Chrishell is moving on with a new romance.
Their name is G Flip.
They’re non-binary, so they go by ‘they/them,’” Chrishell told host Tan France of her current dating life.
The Selling Sunset star’s desire to have a commitment and start a family was heavily featured last season, which became a deal breaker for her and Jason.

     Selling Sunset Reunion: Chrishell Stause Flaunts New Romance As Ex Jason Oppenheim Tears Up Over Her, And Awkward Much?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After five seasons of coworker drama and show-stopping L.A. real estate, Netflix finally went ahead with a Selling Sunset cast reunion special.
But it got even juicier (and slightly more awkward) on set because Chrishell Stause flaunted a new romance to France not long after her ex Jason Oppenheim had teared up over her.
To the surprise of viewers and some of her castmates, the former Days of Our Lives star-turned-real estate agent was candid at the Selling Sunset reunion that she was no longer single.
To make matters even more complicated, Tan France had questioned whether Chrishell Stause would take Jason Oppenheim back if he changed his mind on kids.
So, all in all, maybe the dynamic between Chrishell Stause and Jason Oppenheim is not really so awkward as it felt as a viewer to watch play out on-screen.
