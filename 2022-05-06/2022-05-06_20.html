     Summary: Russian Frigate Admiral Makarov Reportedly On Fire – Unconfirmed reports from Ukraine state that Russia’s Black Sea Fleet may have suffered – or could suffer soon – another catastrophic loss during the war with Ukraine.
The Russian frigate Admiral Makarov was supposedly hit by Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles and set on fire while sailing close to the now-famous Snake Island early on Friday morning.
A Forbes article listed the frigate Admiral Makarov as possibly the “juiciest target” for the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Black Sea.
