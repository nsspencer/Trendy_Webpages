     Goodwill Sold a Bust for $34.99. It’s an Ancient Roman Relic.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Laura Young was browsing through a Goodwill store in Austin, Texas, in 2018 when she found a bust for sale.
It was resting on the floor, under a table, and had a yellow price tag slapped on its cheek: $34.99.
It was an actual Roman bust from the late 1st century B.C.
or early 1st century A.D., which had been part of a Bavarian king’s art collection from the 19th century until it was looted during World War II.
But the most likely path suggests it was taken by an American soldier after the Bavarian king’s villa in Germany was bombed by Allied forces.

     Goodwill find in Texas turns out to be ancient Roman bust
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN ANTONIO (AP) — A marble bust that a Texas woman bought for about $35 from a Goodwill store is temporarily on display at a San Antonio museum after experts determined it was a centuries-old sculpture missing from Germany since World War II.
The ancient Roman bust dates to the first century B.C.
Young said there were a few months of “intense excitement” after learning the history behind the piece, which she found on the floor beneath a table at a Goodwill in Austin, Texas.
Young reached a deal to return the bust to Germany with the help of an attorney who specializes in international art law, Austin radio station KUT reported.
“But it was bittersweet since I knew I couldn’t keep or sell the (bust),” she said.

     Ancient Roman Sculpture Likely Looted During WWII Turns Up at Texas Goodwill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Young first noticed a marble bust under a table at an Austin Goodwill store, she was captivated by its aesthetic.
At $34.99, which Young notes is “a pretty high price for Goodwill,” she decided it was worthwhile for such an unusual find.
“It’s a portrait of an outlaw, a sort of enemy of the state,” Lynley McAlpine, a postdoctoral curatorial fellow at the San Antonio Museum of Art, tells the Express-News.
Records show that the marble statue was once housed at the Pompeiianum, a reproduced Roman villa in Aschaffenburg, Germany.
“We know that many of the objects were either destroyed in the Allied bombing campaign or looted afterward,” Mulder tells KUT.
