     Avalanche fans pepper Duchene with boos and chants, and rightfully so
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nashville Predators center Matt Duchene heard loud boos and nasty chants from Avalanche fans in Games 1 and 2.
Avalanche fans haven’t forgotten how it ended or his antics when he played in Colorado.
Regardless, Duchene experienced very little team success with the Avalanche, despite posting a lot of big individual numbers.
Duchene has played for the Senators, Blue Jackets and now Predators since he left — the Avalanche just keep getting better without him.
Boo away, Avs fans.

The Predators turned to Hynes in 2019 and the team has since made three consecutive playoff appearances.

     Boulding: Singular Focus is Avalanche Key to Success
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: #Preds Head Coach John Hynes says goaltender Juuse Saros (lower-body) “will not be in” for Game 3.
#StanleyCup — Brooks Bratten (@brooksbratten) May 6, 2022The Avalanche are focused on the singular purpose of winning the Stanley Cup, and very little can get in the way of that.
“We’ve already gone over Rittich, and we’ve gone over Ingram,” head coach Jared Bednar said Friday of preparations for Game 3.
I can safely say, in my years with and around the franchise, I’ve never seen an Avalanche team so dedicated to that end.
But it’s the bond that forms from shared goals, grouped beliefs, unified trust, and the unforgettable sting of unmet expectations and falling short that informs Colorado’s singular focus.

It’s not even close.” – Greg Carvel after UMass advanced to the Frozen FourThe 2018-19 UMass hockey season was something alumni like me could have only dreamed of.
Scoring or assisting on goals in big moments moved from a surprise to the expectation, as it became clear that the Avs new star was a rookie in name only.

     Summary: I wanted to wait and see which Nashville Predators team came out of the locker room to start the game.
The question was whether or not the team that came out to start the first period followed that game plan.
My biggest complaint was that the Predators didn’t seem to ever get set up on either of the power plays.
Oh, and Connor Ingram got the start in net and looked cool, calm, and collected.
