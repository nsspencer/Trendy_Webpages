     Was Game 2 the turning point for the Panthers’ playoff hopes? It’s probably not so simple
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even after a 5-1 rout of the Washington Capitals in Game 2, the Florida Panthers don’t quite feel like themselves yet.
Even if its third period probably can’t be totally replicated across a full game, Florida still found positive building blocks from the way it finished up the two games in Sunrise.
“We played a pretty tight-checking game,” Brunette said.
When it went up 2-0 in the first period Thursday, Florida forced Washington to come out of its shell.
David Santiago dsantiago@miamiherald.comTime set for Game 5The Panthers’ win Thursday guaranteed the first-round series will come back to Florida for at least one more game.

Laviolette said Friday morning that Washington will have to “evaluate everything” from Game 2, including a possible change in net.
Vanecek, who made 30 saves in Washington’s Game 1 win Tuesday, could very well be the starter Saturday despite being pulled in Game 2.
It would have been great if we could have just moved from Game 1 to Game 2 and had the same lineup, but that opportunity wasn’t there.

     Closing Shot: The Year Of The Rat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Florida Panthers look to exterminate a pesky playoff mark, we look back at how their last successful postseason run launched a ‘rat trick’ tradition.
The drought dates to 1996, known in team lore as the Year of the Rat.
The company provided the team’s on-ice cleanup crew with Orkin-branded hard hats and overalls, and the Orkin Rat Patrol was born.
Opposing teams lobbied for delay-of-game penalties, but Jordan credited NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman for understanding the “rat trick” was too good to exterminate.
“I’d love for people to never have to say again, ‘Well, the last playoff series they won, in 1996 …”
