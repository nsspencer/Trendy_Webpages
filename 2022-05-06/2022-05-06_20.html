     Xbox Network experiencing major outage affecting cloud gaming, launching games, and more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Xbox Network is the infrastructure that powers most of the Xbox gaming experience, and outages affecting that network can drastically reduce the capabilities of the entire Xbox ecosystem.
We're aware that some users are unable to purchase games, launch games or start Cloud Gaming sessions.
The Xbox Network team is currently investigating the outage and potential solutions, but the situation hasn't improved, yet.
At least for now, the Xbox Network outage isn't affecting anything related to Xbox Accounts, multiplayer gaming, social features, or other connected services and features.
Hopefully, the Xbox Network outage won't last long, and players will quickly be able to return to their favorite Xbox games without any issues.
