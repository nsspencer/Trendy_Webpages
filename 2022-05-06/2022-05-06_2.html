     Rangers show the mettle to make a deep run by squashing the Penguins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fatigue could not be found — just the resilience of a team with the makeup to make a memorable postseason run.
Returning to Madison Square Garden after a painful triple-overtime Game 1 loss to the Penguins, the Rangers bounced back to even their first-round series with last night’s 5-2 win.
Igor Shesterkin followed up his remarkable 79-save effort in the opener to stop 39 shots, preventing the Rangers from giving away another multi-goal lead.
The memory of the disheartening marathon loss quickly evaporated as Andrew Copp scored his second goal of the playoffs less than seven minutes into the game.
Igor Shesterkin stops Sidney Crosby on the doorstep in the Rangers’ Game 2 victory.

     Summary: The club’s series opener against the Rangers on Friday in The Bronx has been postponed by rain.
The second game will start about 30 minutes after the conclusion of the first.
The first game will be broadcast by Prime Video — which was supposed to air Friday’s game — with the second game on YES Network.
Friday’s Yankees game will be made up as part of a Sunday doubleheader.
Saturday’s forecast also calls for rain, though both the Yankees and Rangers have an off day on Monday if it is needed for another makeup.

     Miller leads Rangers to win over Phillies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Brad Miller hit a two-run single in the 10th inning to give the Texas Rangers a 2-1 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday night.
Marcus Semien doubled and had two hits for the Rangers, who have won a season-high four in a row after sweeping the two-game series with the Phillies.
Pinch-hitter Nick Solak struck out before Miller lined a 1-0 slider from Brad Hand (1-1) to right to score Garcia and White.
“He’s so gritty and gutty you know you were going to get something out of him there,” Rangers manager Chris Woodward said of Miller.
It looked like the Phillies had gotten on the board in the sixth when Castellanos lined Perez’s first pitch to right.

     Mark Madden: Goaltending leaves Penguins at grave disadvantage vs. Rangers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He’s not why the Penguins lost Game 2 at New York on Thursday.
• The Penguins need to get offense from somebody besides the line of Crosby, Jake Guentzel and Bryan Rust.
That line has four of the Penguins’ five even-strength goals on the series and provides most of their sustained pressure.
Letang and Matheson were not nearly as good in Game 2 as they were in Game 1.
But the sad fact remains: The goaltending matchup likely makes it impossible for the Penguins to win this series.

     Offense and Igor Shesterkin outweigh defensive issues as Rangers even series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are a few reasons to think the Rangers won’t be able to tighten up the way Gallant wants the rest of this series.
The Rangers had no answers for Crosby for a second straight game.
With Ryan Lindgren (lower body) a late scratch, the Rangers were trying to defend Pittsburgh’s top forwards with essentially three defensemen.
The Rangers still were a bit stubborn with the puck for stretches of Game 2, and Gallant seemed most frustrated by that.
The coach won’t like it and Shesterkin may need a few days on his couch when it’s over, but the Rangers can win this series without needing their best defensive effort.
