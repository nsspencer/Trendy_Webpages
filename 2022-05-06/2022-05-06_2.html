As of this moment, Charles Oliveira remains the UFC Lightweight Champion, but upon the start of the Main Event Headliner tomorrow night he will vacate the 155-pound title.
The fight will proceed as scheduled, but the championship will only be on the line for Gaethje.
If Oliveira wins, he will be the number one contender for the vacant Lightweight Championship and will fight the next challenger for the undisputed title belt at a time and place to be determined.

     Charles Oliveira Stripped Of UFC Title After Missing Weight By Half A Pound
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charles Oliveira was set to defend his UFC lightweight title against Justin Gaethje this weekend in Phoenix, and while the two men will still fight, only Gaethje will be eligible to win the belt.
Oliveira lost his title after he missed weight by half a pound, first at the official weigh-ins, then again by the same margin one hour later.
This is now the fourth time Oliveira has missed weight in his professional MMA career; the previous three instances were at featherweight, so this is the first time he failed to make 155 pounds.
Oliveira’s coach Diego Lima posted Thursday night that his fighter was already on weight, and indeed, Oliveira seemed shocked to have missed weight on the first go-round.
UFC weigh-in rules allow fighters in non-championship fights to exceed their division’s weight limit by one pound, while championship fighters must come in at or under their division’s limit.
