    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fatigue could not be found — just the resilience of a team with the makeup to make a memorable postseason run.
Returning to Madison Square Garden after a painful triple-overtime Game 1 loss to the Penguins, the Rangers bounced back to even their first-round series with last night’s 5-2 win.
Igor Shesterkin followed up his remarkable 79-save effort in the opener to stop 39 shots, preventing the Rangers from giving away another multi-goal lead.
The memory of the disheartening marathon loss quickly evaporated as Andrew Copp scored his second goal of the playoffs less than seven minutes into the game.
Igor Shesterkin stops Sidney Crosby on the doorstep in the Rangers’ Game 2 victory.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — Reports of the New York Rangers’ demise have been greatly exaggerated.
Two nights after losing a triple overtime thriller, the Blueshirts came back with an at-times-dominant performance in a 5-2 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference First Round series at Madison Square Garden on Thursday.
If Igor Shesterkin can keep this up, however, the Rangers might have a chance to advance when it comes back to Manhattan on Wednesday night.
“He made three or four real good saves in the third for sure, early on when it was (3-2), so that was huge for us,” Rangers head coach Gerard Gallant said.
That kept us in it,” Penguins center Sidney Crosby, who scored one of Pittsburgh’s two goals on the night, said of Domingue’s effort.

     Mark Madden: Goaltending leaves Penguins at grave disadvantage vs. Rangers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He’s not why the Penguins lost Game 2 at New York on Thursday.
• The Penguins need to get offense from somebody besides the line of Crosby, Jake Guentzel and Bryan Rust.
That line has four of the Penguins’ five even-strength goals on the series and provides most of their sustained pressure.
Letang and Matheson were not nearly as good in Game 2 as they were in Game 1.
But the sad fact remains: The goaltending matchup likely makes it impossible for the Penguins to win this series.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Brad Miller hit a two-run single in the 10th inning to give the Texas Rangers a 2-1 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday night.
Marcus Semien doubled and had two hits for the Rangers, who have won a season-high four in a row after sweeping the two-game series with the Phillies.
Pinch-hitter Nick Solak struck out before Miller lined a 1-0 slider from Brad Hand (1-1) to right to score Garcia and White.
“He’s so gritty and gutty you know you were going to get something out of him there,” Rangers manager Chris Woodward said of Miller.
It looked like the Phillies had gotten on the board in the sixth when Castellanos lined Perez’s first pitch to right.

But while the result was not in doubt in the waning moments, the Rangers still got a gargantuan scare.
Star goalie Igor Shesterkin was shaken up after the Penguins’ Jeff Carter collided with him with under three minutes to go.
“I wasn’t too happy obviously in a game like that,” head coach Gerard Gallant told reporters after the game.
“I feel great,” Shesterkin told reporters through a interpreter.
