     Summary: Academy Award-winner Will Smith will be one of the guests on the popular Netflix series, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction.

According to the report, Smith is one of several luminary guests in the new season.

     Apple TV+ film Emancipation reportedly moving to 2023 release after Will Smith slap incident
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Heading into 2022, Apple TV+ was preparing to fill its original film slate with a major blockbuster original film, ‘Emancipation’, directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Will Smith.
Although Apple has never officially given a release timeframe to Emancipation before, it was widely expected to be one of Apple’s awards darlings for the upcoming circuit, with a release in the fall.
This follows Apple Original Film’s achievement of getting Best Picture recognition within its first two years of eligibility, making Apple TV+ the first streaming service ever to pick up the Oscar’s highest accolade.
As soon as that happened, the awards prospects for Emancipation — particularly whilst the incident remains in recent memory — evaporated.
Variety says that post-production on the film is still ongoing, which is another possible factor as to the schedule pushback.
