     UFC Champion Stripped Of Title Belt: Fans React
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The UFC stripped Charles Oliveira of his lightweight title on Friday because he missed weight.
Some UFC fans are frustrated that Oliveira was stripped of his title in this fashion.
"I think it is such BS to completely strip him of his title when he earned it over .5 pounds," a UFC fan tweeted.
If Oliveira wins on Saturday, he'll become the No.
On the flip side, if Gaethje wins, he'll leave UFC 274 as the champion.

     Charles Oliveira Stripped Of UFC Title After Missing Weight By Half A Pound
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charles Oliveira was set to defend his UFC lightweight title against Justin Gaethje this weekend in Phoenix, and while the two men will still fight, only Gaethje will be eligible to win the belt.
Oliveira lost his title after he missed weight by half a pound, first at the official weigh-ins, then again by the same margin one hour later.
This is now the fourth time Oliveira has missed weight in his professional MMA career; the previous three instances were at featherweight, so this is the first time he failed to make 155 pounds.
Oliveira’s coach Diego Lima posted Thursday night that his fighter was already on weight, and indeed, Oliveira seemed shocked to have missed weight on the first go-round.
UFC weigh-in rules allow fighters in non-championship fights to exceed their division’s weight limit by one pound, while championship fighters must come in at or under their division’s limit.
