     Will the New Disney+ Series Redeem the ‘Percy Jackson’ Franchise?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eventually, on Jan. 25, it was announced that a television show based on the five Percy Jackson books would soon come to the streaming service.
The book introduces Percy Jackson as he finds out his father is the Greek god Poseidon, who left him and his mother before he was born.
Additionally, the choice to adapt “Percy Jackson” into a television show rather than a reboot film series may be precisely what is needed for such a long story.
Known for his charismatic and witty role alongside Ryan Reynolds in “The Adam Project,” Walker Scobell was reported to have been cast as Percy Jackson.
So, could they redeem Percy Jackson?
