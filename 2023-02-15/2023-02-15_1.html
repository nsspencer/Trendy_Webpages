     Summary: Jesse Marsch will not become the new manager of Premier League club Southampton, according to a report from The Telegraph’s Jeremy Wilson.
It was believed he could be in charge this weekend for their trip to Chelsea on Saturday (watch live, 10am ET on Peacock Premium).
Is this the right job at the right time for Marsch?
Just a week after being fired by Leeds, this is a great chance for Marsch to stay in the Premier League.
If he able to do that this season, there is a real chance he could have found the right club at the right time in his career.
