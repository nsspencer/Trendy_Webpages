     Lana Del Rey, 'A&amp;W'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lana Del Rey, 'A&amp;W' Lana Del Rey rapsPolydor YouTubeThe most rewarding experience of being a careerlong Lana Del Rey fan is that of watching the scaffolding upholding the American pop archetypes, the same she has lovingly inhabited, slowly crumble.
In the very beginning it was, for many, all too much — the summahtime sadness and Pepsi Cola-flavored p****, daddy issues collected like trading cards.
But with every release the American flag flapping at the edges of her discography has inched closer and closer to a permanent half-mast.
"A&amp;W," the second single from her forthcoming album Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd., is Lana further, gloriously unspooled.
This is Lana walking the tightrope between her plasticky pop roots and her contemporary folk minimalism — vulnerable, but not enough to give up on a good time.

I mean, look at me, look at the length of my hair, my face, the shape of my body.

     Here’s The NSFW Double Meaning Behind Lana’s “A&amp;W” Lyrics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sure, that sounds like a dark rom-com; however, there’s so much appeal behind Lana’s lyrics that you’re intrigued to hear about these characters’ stories.
Enter “A&amp;W,” a moody tune about how women struggle with societal pressure.
“A&amp;W” is the latest single from her upcoming album, Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd.
With ghastly vocals, Lana opens the seven-minute track by comparing her younger self to the woman she’s now become.
“A&amp;W” is a quintessential Lana record, bubbling with chaotic intrigue, absurdly long yet expressive lyrics, and Americana symbolism.
