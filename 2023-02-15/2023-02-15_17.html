     Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon resigns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made the unexpected announcement Wednesday that she would be resigning from government after eight years in the role.
Why it matters: Sturgeon has been a champion of the Scottish independence movement.
The departure makes her the second high-profile female leader in the world to announce a resignation in recent weeks.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said last month that she would be stepping down as leader on Feb. 7, citing burnout as one of the impetuses for the decision.
State of play: Sturgeon said she has directed the Scottish National Party's national secretary to commence the process of picking a new party leader and that she will remain in the role until her successor is chosen.

     Summary: Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon, supporter of independence and trans rights, will resignEnlarge this image toggle caption JANE BARLOW/Pool/AFP via Getty Images JANE BARLOW/Pool/AFP via Getty ImagesScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced her intention to resign after more than eight years as head of the country's government.
Sturgeon's departure is likely to complicate an issue her party long championed: the Scottish independence movement.
It was Scotland's unsuccessful referendum vote in 2014 that led Sturgeon's predecessor, Alex Salmond, to resign.
Sturgeon, now 52, was the first woman to lead the country's Scottish National Party (SNP) and serve as first minister.
As for the independence movement, Sturgeon said on Wednesday that the U.K.'s next election would serve as "a de facto vote" on the feasibility of Scottish independence.

     Nicola Sturgeon Was the Tories’ Best Foil. Now She’s Gone.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But there is no question that, as with Ardern, Sturgeon was facing sagging polls and growing doubts about her leadership and the direction of her party.
Support for Scottish independence has fallen to 47% from 53% since December.
How would Scotland manage without the enormous transfers from Westminster that Sturgeon conveniently ignored when blaming London for various problems?
Sturgeon argued that Brexit posed a “material change in circumstances” that should give Scots another independence vote — in what became called Indyref2.
But Sturgeon made clear that while she’s stepped down from the leadership, she’ll remain a lawmaker and champion of the issues closest to her, including independence.

     Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to leave post after 8 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the referendum was billed as a once-in-a-generation decision on independence, Sturgeon and her Scottish National Party have pushed for a new vote, arguing that Britain’s departure from the European Union had changed the ground rules.
The first female leader of Scotland’s devolved government, Sturgeon said she planned to remain in office until the SNP elects a new leader.
Sturgeon came under pressure in recent weeks after she pushed the gender recognition bill through the Scottish parliament over the objections of some members of her own party.
Sturgeon led Scotland through the coronavirus pandemic and guided her party during three U.K.-wide elections and two Scottish elections.
Sturgeon had vowed to take the British government to court, arguing that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s administration had made a “profound mistake” by vetoing the legislation.
