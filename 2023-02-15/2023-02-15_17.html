     Scotland’s Nicola Sturgeon quits

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nicola Sturgeon speaks during a press conference at Bute House in Edinburgh where she announced she will stand down as Scotland's first minister | Pool photo by Jane Barlow/AFP via Getty ImagesNicola Sturgeon is resigning as Scotland’s first minister in a move that stunned her pro-independence party and fired the starting pistol on the race to succeed her.
Citing the personal toll of the job and a desire to “free” her party to pick its own Scottish independence strategy, Sturgeon, 52, said it had been a “privilege beyond measure” to serve as first minister.
Sturgeon will, she said, “remain in office until my successor is elected,” but made clear she believed it was now the “right time” to move on.
Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond as first minister in 2014 after the SNP failed in its first referendum bid to take Scotland out of the United Kingdom.
The pair later fell out spectacularly as Salmond faced sexual assault charges, of which he was cleared after a two-week trial.

     Summary: Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon, supporter of independence and trans rights, will resignEnlarge this image toggle caption JANE BARLOW/Pool/AFP via Getty Images JANE BARLOW/Pool/AFP via Getty ImagesScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced her intention to resign after more than eight years as head of the country's government.
Sturgeon's departure is likely to complicate an issue her party long championed: the Scottish independence movement.
It was Scotland's unsuccessful referendum vote in 2014 that led Sturgeon's predecessor, Alex Salmond, to resign.
Sturgeon, now 52, was the first woman to lead the country's Scottish National Party (SNP) and serve as first minister.
As for the independence movement, Sturgeon said on Wednesday that the U.K.'s next election would serve as "a de facto vote" on the feasibility of Scottish independence.

     Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to leave post after 8 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the referendum was billed as a once-in-a-generation decision on independence, Sturgeon and her Scottish National Party have pushed for a new vote, arguing that Britain’s departure from the European Union had changed the ground rules.
The first female leader of Scotland’s devolved government, Sturgeon said she planned to remain in office until the SNP elects a new leader.
Sturgeon came under pressure in recent weeks after she pushed the gender recognition bill through the Scottish parliament over the objections of some members of her own party.
Sturgeon led Scotland through the coronavirus pandemic and guided her party during three U.K.-wide elections and two Scottish elections.
Sturgeon had vowed to take the British government to court, arguing that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s administration had made a “profound mistake” by vetoing the legislation.
