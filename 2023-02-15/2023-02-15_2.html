     Tiger Woods' stunning rally with 3 straight birdies caps 'great round' at Riviera in return to tour
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For those looking for encouragement from this outing, beyond the closing birdie barrage, Woods’ gait looked better than it did when he played, riding in a cart, in The Match in December and then again at the PNC Championship with son, Charlie.
But he still slightly dragged his right leg due to the ankle that was damaged in his car accident two years ago, as well as the plantar fasciitis that he’s contended with more recently.

     Summary: Tiger Woods’ former caddie is making a comeback this week, tooShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailAdam Scott and Steve Williams will be teaming up on occasion in 2023.
Getty ImagesPACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. — It would be easy to say that Tiger Woods is the most intriguing person at the Genesis Invitational this week.
For over a decade, Williams was the most famous caddie in the world, serving on Tiger Woods’ bag for 13 major championship victories.
He was eager to return this week — but his caddie almost didn’t make it.
Earlier in the week, when asked why Williams’ presence is so important, Scott cited his caddie’s intensity.

     Summary: Tiger Woods finishes strong as he birdies his last three holes to finish the day at 2-under par.
Tiger Woods shot a 2-under 69 in the first round of the Genesis Invitational and is five shots off the lead.
Woods told reporters Tuesday that hitting shots was not a problem.
A few times in the round, Woods removed his right shoe and adjusted his ankle brace and sock.
Woods said so much of what made the round enjoyable was playing alongside Thomas and McIlroy, two of his closest friends.

     Genesis Invitational: Tiger Woods’ late birdie rally saves opening round at Riviera
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

That brought Woods to even par on the day, and stopped what was becoming a tough stretch of golf.
