     Report: Bulls have had conversations with Patrick Beverley’s camp
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though the Chicago Bulls were one of just two teams who didn’t make a trade prior to last Thursday’s deadline, they plan to be active in the buyout market.
Johnson of NBCS Chicago, the Bulls have had conversations with not just Russell Westbrook, but another fellow former Laker guard, as well.
“The Bulls’ interest in Russell Westbrook should the veteran point guard reach a buyout from the Utah Jazz is legitimate.
If the Bulls strike out on their pursuit of Westbrook, look for Beverley to become a real target for Chicago.

     Bulls’ Billy Donovan on Russell Westbrook: ‘He was always ready to play’

     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS — Billy Donovan can’t talk about a potential reunion with Russell Westbrook.
Advertisement“I really can’t talk about him with him under contract with a different team,” Donovan said.
I asked Zach LaVine about the Bulls potentially adding Russell Westbrook: “Russ is a future Hall of Famer, man.
Donovan would touch only on what he appreciates about Westbrook as a player from the standpoint of their time together.
What’s the urgency to try to inject or bring somebody in that could help?”(Photo of Billy Donovan and Russell Westbrook with Oklahoma City in 2017: Sue Ogrocki / Associated Press)

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Staring down the barrel of a season where the Chicago Bulls miss the postseason entirely, some franchise-altering decisions are set to be made.
One of the most significant will be what happens with the recently signed Zach LaVine.
According to @thekapman on @ESPN1000, Zach LaVine's relationship with head coach Billy Donovan "has sailed" and everyone else in the Chicago Bulls locker room is on Donovan's side.
Zach LaVine on getting benched down the stretch: “That’s Billy’s decision, he got to lay with it.
Nevertheless, this season, LaVine’s points, assists, and three-point percentage are all lower than ever since his first year in Chicago.

     Billy Donovan cites lost composure as Bulls blow 24-point lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What Karnišovas saw Wednesday night was a Chicago Bulls team that lost composure---again---and lost for a season-high fifth straight time, blowing a 24-point lead in a 117-113 meltdown to the Indiana Pacers.
Lost composure is what coach Billy Donovan cited as the main reason the Bulls lost on a night they snapped out of their long-distance shooting slump with 15 3-pointers and a monster game from Zach LaVine.
He finished with 35 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists on a night the Bulls played without DeMar DeRozan.
The loss ties for the second-largest blown lead of the NBA season and also marks the fifth time the Bulls have lost at least a 16-point lead this season.

     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS — The Bulls came into Gainbridge Fieldhouse attempting to end a four-game skid.
“We compete pretty hard but what happens is the game gets ratcheted up, physically, mentally and emotionally,” coach Billy Donovan said.
But in the final seconds when the Bulls needed a clutch bucket from their max player, he came up short.
The Pacers outscored the Bulls 40-28 in the third as the urgency the Bulls have been so desperately searching for once again eluded them.
The Bulls forced 19 Pacers turnovers and converted them into 23 points.

     Jazz Grant Russell Westbrook Permission to Talk to Bulls
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jazz give Westbrook permission to speak with Bulls originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoThe Utah Jazz have granted Russell Westbrook permission to speak with prospective teams on the buyout market, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
Wojnarowski, who said last week that the Bulls are "a front-runner" to land the the point guard, reported Wednesday that Westbrook and his agent have already talked to the Bulls, Clippers, Wizards and Heat.
The Bulls are in the mix to add a player via the buyout market, currently targeting veteran point guards.
Westbrook currently is planning to take some time to decide whether he’ll stay with the Utah Jazz or enter the buyout market, which is keeping the Bulls and other teams in a holding pattern.
If the Bulls don’t add Westbrook, John Wall and Patrick Beverley are names to monitor.

     Four observations: Pacers rally back from down 24 to stun Bulls
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS -- The Pacers rallied back from 24 points down to beat the Bulls 117-113 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Wednesday night, snapping a five-game losing streak.
Turner said there was a difference in attitude, but that the Pacers also purposefully became more unpredictable.
It was the second time this season the Pacers have come back to beat the Bulls after falling behind by at least 20.
Offensively, they had fewer field goals (five) than turnovers (seven), shooting 5 of 18 from the field while the Bulls were 15 of 24.
The Pacers made 13 of their first 14 field-goal attempts and finished 15 of 20 in the period, outscoring the Bulls 40-28.

     Russell Westbrook would be punishment for the Bulls’ sin of underperforming
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I’ve been racking my brain for days trying to understand why the Bulls would have an interest in signing the fractious Russell Westbrook.
Westbrook as a Bull doesn’t make sense in any concrete way, but it does make sense as a cosmic judgment.
He’d be punishment for Bulls players who talk about how much they enjoy playing with each other but can’t win with each other.
This would be punishment for Bulls vice president Arturas Karnisovas, too, which might seem odd, given that he’d be the one signing Westbrook.
Westbrook doesn’t help teams.
