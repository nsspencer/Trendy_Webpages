This week, we lift your spirits with the playlist heard on the set of our March 2023 cover shoot with Lana Del Rey, crafted with love by the shoot’s lighting technician David López Osuna.
In the kitchen while I’m making breakfast for my wife and very hungry dachshund.
I saw a tribute band perform The Door’s “Light My Fire” at the Orange County Fair when I was twelve.

     Lana Del Rey, 'A&amp;W'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lana Del Rey, 'A&amp;W' Lana Del Rey rapsPolydor YouTubeThe most rewarding experience of being a careerlong Lana Del Rey fan is that of watching the scaffolding upholding the American pop archetypes, the same she has lovingly inhabited, slowly crumble.
In the very beginning it was, for many, all too much — the summahtime sadness and Pepsi Cola-flavored p****, daddy issues collected like trading cards.
But with every release the American flag flapping at the edges of her discography has inched closer and closer to a permanent half-mast.
"A&amp;W," the second single from her forthcoming album Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd., is Lana further, gloriously unspooled.
This is Lana walking the tightrope between her plasticky pop roots and her contemporary folk minimalism — vulnerable, but not enough to give up on a good time.

So, what does "A&amp;W" mean?
“A&amp;W” stands for “American Wh-re,” which is a title Lana gives herself in the song.
I mean, look at me, look at the length of my hair, my face, the shape of my body.
In "A&amp;W," Lana is inferring that she's inviting men to her hotel room to have meaningless sex.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lana Del Rey and Billie Eilish recently sat down for an Interview conversation that was published yesterday (February 14).
During that chat, Del Rey spoke about why she decided to shift away from an NSFW cover for Did You Know That There’s A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd.
In other news regarding early plans for the album, she also revealed that it almost had an even longer title: Did You Know That There’s A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd Pearl Watch Me On Ring A Bell Psycho Lifeguard.
It’s going to now be called ‘Did You Know That There’s A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd Pearl Watch Me On Ring A Bell Psycho Lifeguard.” He was like, ‘What the f*ck?’ I was like, ‘I’m not telling anyone.
Then he was like, ‘This is reminding me of a format that I’ve always wanted to play with.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sure, that sounds like a dark rom-com; however, there’s so much appeal behind Lana’s lyrics that you’re intrigued to hear about these characters’ stories.
Enter “A&amp;W,” a moody tune about how women struggle with societal pressure.
“A&amp;W” is the latest single from her upcoming album, Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd.
With ghastly vocals, Lana opens the seven-minute track by comparing her younger self to the woman she’s now become.
“A&amp;W” is a quintessential Lana record, bubbling with chaotic intrigue, absurdly long yet expressive lyrics, and Americana symbolism.

When things shift radically in your life you have to almost want to have a radical perspective shift.
I know that the process I went through is not the process a lot of people went through.
Now, you hear a lot of singer-songwriters and rappers talking about how things really are in their lives, and a lot of it is super messy.
