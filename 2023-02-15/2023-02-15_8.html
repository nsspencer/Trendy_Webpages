     Mikal Bridges puts up 45 in Nets win over Heat to head into all-star break
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BROOKLYN — The new-look Nets got their first win of the post-Kevin Durant era and Brooklyn gets to head into the NBA All-Star break with a win.
The Nets picked up a gritty 116-105 win over the Miami Heat on Wednesday night at Barclays Center as Mikal Bridges hit a new career high in points with 45 and Cam Thomas added 19.
Bridges recorded the third 30-plus point game of his career and his second as a member of the Nets.
CLAIM OFFERThe win was the Nets’ second in their last six games and it prevented them from going into the break on a three-game skid.
Bridges scored 17 of his 45 points in the final 12 minutes of the game as the Nets pulled away from the Heat.

     Mikal Bridges’ career night offers Nets ray of hope in win over Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mikal Bridges of the Brooklyn Nets reacts after making a three-point basket.
Bridges took over midway through the period, scoring 15 straight Nets points.
In a game that featured Heat stars Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, Bridges was the best player on the court.
Bridges scored from all levels, seemingly at will, and emerged as the Nets’ go-to scorer after playing a more complementary role with the Suns.
“Defense comes first before anything.”Nets guard Cam Thomas (24) dribbles against Miami Heat guard Max Strus.

     Mikal Bridges’ career night carries Nets past Heat as Brooklyn begins to jell
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Nets shot 39 3s, one off Vaughn’s target number, and they hit 43 percent of them.
Going into the fourth quarter, the score had been tied 11 times with 10 lead changes, and the Nets led by three.
Bridges’ 17 fourth-quarter points made the game a non-factor in the final minutes as the Nets expanded their advantage to double digits.
Nic Claxton’s biggest observation Wednesday was that the Nets’ pace, which Vaughn said will be another key, was mediocre.
After having a career night on offense, Bridges was more interested in talking about his defense.
