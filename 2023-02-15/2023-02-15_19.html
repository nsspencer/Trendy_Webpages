     Why Louis Vuitton’s Choice Of Pharrell Williams As Men’s Creative Director Is So Inspired
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: o Pharrell is not entirely an outsider either: If Williams is not a fashion-insider, neither is he really an outsider.
o Williams is a neo-generalist, T-shaped connector: Vogue has referred to Pharrell Williams as a “multi-hyphenate musician and entrepreneur” and that “multi-hyphenate” tells it all.
o Williams is an experimenter: So much of what is happening today involves navigating the unknown, and that inevitably calls for experimentation; experimentation has been at the heart of many of Williams’ success.
His best-known musical hit is the song “Happy,” which he wrote for the movie Despicable Me 2.
In addition, and not to be under-estimated, is that Pharrell Williams lives his craft as a creative catalyst, in everything he does; innovation is his life-style.
