    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you decided to suddenly ‚Äî and perhaps finally ‚Äî undo your learning of how calendars and seasons work, you could‚Äôve easily envisioned Tuesday‚Äôs showdown between the Bruins and Stars as being worth more than two points.
Maybe even, say, a 35-pound drinking cup with an oversized handle full of players and coaches from the past?
In what was a showdown of the East‚Äôs best and the West‚Äôs best, the Bruins and Stars did not disappoint, as the sides traded saves, punches, and goals for over 63 minutes of play before David Pastrnak sent the crowd up to their feet and towards the exits with a bomb that put him on his pants.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Beyond the usual black-and-gold contingent filling the stands of away arenas, the Bruins had some extra support in the building for Tuesday‚Äôs road matchup against the Stars.
The B‚Äôs bloodlines had plenty to cheer about in Dallas, especially Pavel Zacha‚Äôs sister, Leona.
With his two-point showing against the Stars, Zacha has now hit a new career high with 37 points through 53 games this season.
Pastrnak‚Äôs game-winner was a much-needed result for the Bruins, who entered Tuesday‚Äôs matchup stuck in a 1-3-1 rut.
And as expected, the whole Bruins roster was greeted by their raucous brothers and sisters following the dramatic victory.

It didn‚Äôt look so great for the Bruins at the beginning, but just as we‚Äôve seen so many times this season, a strong third period made all the difference.
Here are five takeaways from the Bruins‚Äô win.
He never quite reached his ceiling while in New Jersey, but Zacha has been a seamless fit as a member of the Bruins.

88 THE GREAT üö® pic.twitter.com/UphZTkb6m6 ‚Äî Boston Bruins (@NHLBruins) February 15, 2023The Bruins didn‚Äôt make it easy on themselves.
Another penalty kill stood in Boston‚Äôs path to victory, this time with Marchand in the box for interference.
Brandon Carlo and Derek Forbort put together an iron man penalty kill, absorbing as much rubber as possible during the 4-on-3 situation.
As good as their penalty kill performed Tuesday night, the struggling power play was anything but efficient.

     Summary: David Pastrnak scored with 1:16 remaining in overtime, and the Boston Bruins rallied for a 3-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on Tuesday night.
DALLAS ‚Äî David Pastrnak scored with 1:16 remaining in overtime, and the Boston Bruins rallied for a 3-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on Tuesday night in a matchup of the top team in each conference.
The Stars couldn't convert on 57 seconds of a 5-on-3 power play in the second period and a two-minute 4-on-3 session in the extra period.
With the Stars struggling early, Oettinger had two remarkable saves to keep Dallas in it.
Stars: At Minnesota on Friday before two more home games, starting with Columbus on a back-to-back.

     Summary: Which could mean general manager Don Sweeney decides to stand pat leading up to the March 3 trade deadline.
Sweeney has been an active deadline deal-maker ever since taking over the front office in 2015.
Adding Hampus Lindholm last March, along with signing him to an eight-year contract extension, one day could stand as the best move of Sweeney‚Äôs tenure.
But so was landing Lindholm, a today/tomorrow move Sweeney pulled off again without paring current roster assets.
O‚ÄôReilly, essential to the Blues‚Äô win over the Bruins in the ‚Äò19 Final, last week celebrated his 32nd birthday.

That‚Äôs one reason why the Avs join Boston and Carolina as the only teams that currently sport single-digit Stanley Cup odds.
On the flip side, several clubs have seen their Stanley Cup odds rise significantly in the last two months.

If you‚Äôre expecting someone to come in and shake up the defensive core (more on this later) Schenn isn‚Äôt your guy.
Barbashev, along with line mates Oskar Sundqvist and Alexander Steen, tormented the Bergeron line throughout the series and life a nightmare for the Bruins top line.
Nick SeelerSeeler is exactly the kind of under-the-radar trade acquisition Don Sweeney likes to make at the trade deadline (Mike Reilly, Marcus Johansson).
All that considered, it would be nice to have his name and pedigree on the Bruins‚Äô second line in the years ahead.
