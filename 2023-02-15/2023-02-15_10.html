     Duke basketball sneaks by horrid Notre Dame in front of Mike Krzyzewski
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Notre Dame vs. Duke prediction and odds for Tuesday, February 14 by Josh YourishThe Duke basketball team did not put an inspiring performance together against Notre Dame.
Mike Krzyzewski made his return to Cameron Indoor Stadium for the first time since his retirement and the Duke basketball team made sure his Valentine’s Day was stressful.
Duke, riding a two game losing streak, ended the first half with a flurry to take an eight point lead, 31-23, against lowly Notre Dame into halftime.
It looked like the rout would be on in Durham as the Blue Devils would cruise to victory but Mike Brey would have different ideas.
Tyrese Proctor would finish off the game at the free throw line as Duke (18-8, 9-6 ACC) escaped with the victory, 68-64.

     DBR Podcast #489 - Any Win Is A Goodwin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jason, Sam, and Donald are having way too much fun on the latest episode of the Duke Basketball Report Podcast.
Before they can even get to their recap of what worked and what didn’t against Notre Dame, they talk about what it was like having Coach K back in Cameron.
Was his seat in the right place and what did he think of watching two of his assistant coaches go at it on opposite benches?
After dispelling with that, the podcast crew breaks down Duke’s closer than expected victory over the Fighting Irish (and an unconscious Dane Goodwin), including that clutch 3 by Mark Mitchell.
And, before the guys leave, they have a challenge for all of you... they will soon need a (slightly) new name for the DBR Podcast.

     Summary: Fortunately, we have a solution for that: Blue Healer auctions are back and the tickets for Louisville’s visit to Cameron are still available!
You might think this won’t be a great game and certainly Louisville has had a tough year.
So you should bid on Louisville tickets right now!
If you don’t know, Dr. Mike Lee has run Blue Healers for several years and we’ve been happy to help promote it.
It’s a great way to see a game in Cameron in this historic season and to support Jon Scheyer as he builds his program.

     Kyle Filipowski embodied the resiliency Duke basketball needs to collect wins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just 14 seconds into the team’s home game against Notre Dame on Tuesday night, Filipowski scored on a layup.
“He looked great to start the game,” Duke coach Jon Scheyer said.
That continued against a Notre Dame team that in no way resembles the accomplished Cavaliers.
Another freshman, Mark Mitchell, hit a 3-pointer with 10 seconds to play when Notre Dame focused its defensive attention elsewhere.
Graduate student Jacob Grandison, whose 3-pointer tied the Virginia game at 58 before the Filipowski play, tallied four assists against Notre Dame.

     Summary: After each Duke men's basketball game this season, check back here for the Player of the Game and more.
Against Notre Dame Tuesday night, with former Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski on the baseline, the freshman center wrote a different story.
Filipowski, being the only Duke player to score in double figures, played a large role in the Blue Devils' victory.
His risk was rewarded with a perfect corner three that put the Blue Devils up four.
If there was any question that the Blue Devils this season are homebodies, their current 13-0 record in Durham can provide the answer.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We’re pretty sure that people are going to look at the Duke-Notre Dame game Tuesday night and focus on the wrong thing.
Duke didn’t find a counter for Dane Goodwin, who took his defenders - didn't matter who - in the lane and bullied them.
Duke let Notre Dame come back late and nearly steal the game.
That means it’s a lot harder to clog the lane as Notre Dame did.
And against Notre Dame, Filipowski was again hit in the throat.

     Duke, North Carolina and the most precarious of college basketball transitions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two reporters had pulled him aside, hoping for his perspective on what North Carolina — what coach Hubert Davis — had just done.
Then North Carolina turned it around, discovered itself, strung together long stretches of good basketball, toppled Duke at Duke on Mike Krzyzewski’s final home game, and stormed into the NCAA Tournament as a talented No.
“I wanted somebody to take my place that loved the university and the basketball program the way Roy Williams did,” he said.
Williams had pushed hard for Davis’s hire, but Cunningham had made the ultimate call, and the sustained health of the men’s basketball program is any North Carolina athletic director’s top responsibility.
And if Duke and North Carolina can’t stay in power forever and ever, what does the ACC look like?

     LOOK: Mike Krzyzewski made major move to support Duke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike Krzyzewski decided to attend Tuesday night’s game between Duke and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, marking his first time at a Blue Devils basketball game since retiring last spring.
While Krzyzewski might not have wanted to be a distraction this year, it’s clear that his return was very much welcomed by the Duke community.
“For him to be here tonight, you know it’s special for me,” Scheyer said after the game, according to Fox News.
I don’t know how he felt sitting over there instead of on the bench.
I just wanted to make sure we got the win while he was here.”We’ll have to see if he will attend more Duke games in the future – especially if his appearances lead to wins.
