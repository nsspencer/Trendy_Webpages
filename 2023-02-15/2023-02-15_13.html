     Summary: Bruce Springsteen is the artist everyone wants to see in 2023.
Months later, concerts are sold out and ticket prices remain extremely high on the secondary market ... in most cases, at least.
That’s what makes Springsteen’s concert on Feb. 21 in Tulsa, Oklahoma so out of the ordinary.
StubHub and Vivid Seats each have tickets for sale in various sections for that price.

     Bruce Springsteen launches his Telecaster across the stage – and accidentally hits his guitar tech in the head
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruce Springsteen, one of music’s most accomplished livemen, was given a harsh reminder of that reality when he attempted to pull off a cool guitar throw mid-set, only to strike his poor guitar tech right on the head.
Instead, Springsteen launches the Tele towards an oncoming Buell, who unfortunately misjudges the six-string’s flight path and as a result gets struck on the head.
For context, footage from a Seattle show in 2016 and a Munich gig in 2009 captured the perfect example of what the end-of-song guitar throw should look like.
Luckily, it looked as though Buell wasn’t badly injured, and the guitar managed to stave off any serious damage.
Last summer, Tom Morello was accidentally wiped out by a security guard who had jumped on the stage in pursuit of a stage invader.

     Watch Bruce Springsteen Perform ‘If I Was the Priest’ For the First Time Since 1972
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hours after announcing dates for a North American Summer stadium, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band took the stage at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas.
“I wrote this song,” Springsteen said.
I still don’t have a clue what the fuck it’s about.”“If I Was The Priest” pre-dates the formation of the E Street Band.
Springsteen played it in February 1972 during an audition for managers Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos and again in May 1972 when he tried out for CBS Records.
Hopefully, by that point, the full E Street Band will be able to take the stage.

     Watch: Bruce Springsteen Accidentally Hits Guitar Tech in Head with Guitar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That might be the question Bruce Springsteen’s guitar tech Kevin Buell is asking after the live show assistant got struck in the head with Springsteen’s electric guitar at a recent show.
During a concert on February 3 at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena, Springsteen threw his sunburst Telecaster to his tech, but missed or misjudged the toss.
The electric guitar hit the tech squarely in the head.
Springsteen has plenty of time to perfect his guitar-slinging this summer when he brings his 2023 international tour back to North America.
Springsteen and The E Street Band will visit 18 cities in the U.S. and Canada, in addition to the previously announced dates.
