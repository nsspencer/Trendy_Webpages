     Bruins take down Stars in an overtime thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you decided to suddenly — and perhaps finally — undo your learning of how calendars and seasons work, you could’ve easily envisioned Tuesday’s showdown between the Bruins and Stars as being worth more than two points.
Maybe even, say, a 35-pound drinking cup with an oversized handle full of players and coaches from the past?
In what was a showdown of the East’s best and the West’s best, the Bruins and Stars did not disappoint, as the sides traded saves, punches, and goals for over 63 minutes of play before David Pastrnak sent the crowd up to their feet and towards the exits with a bomb that put him on his pants.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Beyond the usual black-and-gold contingent filling the stands of away arenas, the Bruins had some extra support in the building for Tuesday’s road matchup against the Stars.
The B’s bloodlines had plenty to cheer about in Dallas, especially Pavel Zacha’s sister, Leona.
With his two-point showing against the Stars, Zacha has now hit a new career high with 37 points through 53 games this season.
Pastrnak’s game-winner was a much-needed result for the Bruins, who entered Tuesday’s matchup stuck in a 1-3-1 rut.
And as expected, the whole Bruins roster was greeted by their raucous brothers and sisters following the dramatic victory.

Another penalty kill stood in Boston’s path to victory, this time with Marchand in the box for interference.
Brandon Carlo and Derek Forbort put together an iron man penalty kill, absorbing as much rubber as possible during the 4-on-3 situation.
As good as their penalty kill performed Tuesday night, the struggling power play was anything but efficient.

With less than two months remaining in the regular season, here’s an updated look at NHL Stanley Cup odds and betting action.
The good news for the Avs (and the many bettors who have backed Colorado in the NHL Stanley Cup futures market)?
That’s one reason why the Avs join Boston and Carolina as the only teams that currently sport single-digit Stanley Cup odds.
On the flip side, several clubs have seen their Stanley Cup odds rise significantly in the last two months.
