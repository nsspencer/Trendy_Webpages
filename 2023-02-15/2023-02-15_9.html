     Buffalo shooter gets life sentence shortly after man charges at him during emotional hearing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "There can be no mercy for you, no understanding, no second chances," said Judge Susan Eagan while delivering the sentence in court.
The gunman, now 19, had initially pleaded not guilty to the state charges as well as federal charges announced several months after the shooting.
The shooter's guilty plea on state charges may reduce the likelihood of capital punishment.
Payton Gendron is led into the courtroom for a hearing at Erie County Court in Buffalo, New York, on May 19, 2022.
A statement from Gendron was also read aloud in court toward the end of Wednesday's hearing.

     Summary: The Buffalo Tops shooter has been sentenced to life in prison without paroleEnlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesThe 19-year-old white gunman who killed 10 Black people and injured three others at a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y., last year has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
Barbara Massey Mapps berated Gendron and shared memories of her sister, Kat, who was also shot and killed at Tops.
He originally pleaded not guilty to the federal charges, but according to his attorneys, the gunman was willing to plead guilty to the federal charges if prosecutors agreed to spare him the death penalty, CNN reported in December.
Life without parole is New York's highest sentenceErie County District Attorney John Flynn said the judge will be required to sentence Gendron to life without parole for pleading guilty to the domestic terrorism charge.
Also in November, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown told reporters it was emotional to be among those in the courtroom and hearing the pleas.

     Buffalo Shooter Who Sought to ‘Kill as Many Blacks as Possible’ Gets Life in Prison Without Parole
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Relatives struggled through tears as they remembered their lost spouses, children, parents, aunts, cousins, and grandparents who were murdered in the shooting.
Wayne Jones, the only child of Celestine Chaney, addressed Gendron as “bro,” and said that as a father, he felt for Gendron’s mother.
Prosecutors have argued Gendron’s attack at Tops Friendly Markets was motivated by his racism towards Black people.
At one point, he aimed his rifle at a white store employee who had been shot in the leg during the hail of gunfire.
“The war on White people is VERY REAL.”Gendron also faces federal hate crimes charges related to the racist motivation for his attack.

     Buffalo grocery store mass shooter apologizes for racist attack and receives sentence of life in prison
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A number of victims’ family members spoke emotionally Wednesday about how the mass shooting had changed their lives.
At one point, Gendron took off his glasses and began crying during the testimony from the victims’ families.
Speaking after court, several Buffalo officials and families said they did not believe Gendron’s apology was genuine.
He should be able to feel what those families felt that day when he pointed that gun in their faces.
Using an illegally modified semi-automatic rifle, the gunman shot four people outside the grocery store – three of whom died.
