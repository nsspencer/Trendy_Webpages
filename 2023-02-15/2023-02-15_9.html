     Summary: The Daytona 500 has produced kings, kicked off championship dynasties, cemented legacies and lifted relative unknowns into the biggest spotlight.
The "Great American Race" has been held 64 times, with the patriarch of the Petty family, Lee Petty, taking the first Daytona 500 checkered flag in 1959.
His son, Richard "The King" Petty, holds the record for most Daytona 500 victories, winning the first of his seven Harley J. Earl trophies in 1964.
Meanwhile, the most recent drivers to triumph in the Daytona 500 — Michael McDowell (2021) and Austin Cindric (2022) — also scored their very first victories in the Cup Series.

     Summary: He cruised to his fourth win of the year and his second NASCAR Cup Championship, beating Ross Chastain, Christopher Bell and Chase Elliot.
Nick Hensley was his gas man while Coleman Pressley served as Logano’s spotter.
He joined NASCAR when a Craftsman Truck Series team asked him to be their jackman.
Team Penske offered him a job to be a mechanic, and he eventually became a gasman for its NASCAR Xfinity Series team and worked his way up to the Cup series.
Pressley, an Enka alumnus, is the son of former Cup series driver Robert Pressley and the grandson of former Western North Carolina short-track racer Bob Pressley.

Renowned gangster Al Capone frequented the hotspot in its heyday along with moonshiners who were among NASCAR’s first generation of racers.
The hotel generates much of its income during Speedweeks, Bike Week and Spring Break — all staples of the tourism industry in Daytona.
And for me to change that stigma and reputation was another feat in its own.”___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — NASCAR’s next 75 years almost certainly will include at least a partially electric vehicle turning laps at Daytona International Speedway.
Those adjustments led to some of the most memorable winged cars in NASCAR history: the Dodge Charger Daytona and the Plymouth Superbird.
“We did it all for the sake of being more relative to what the fan drives as a passenger car," McReynolds said.
Following concussions to Busch and Alex Bowman, NASCAR adjusted the car in hopes of reducing the amount of force delivered to drivers amid rear-impact crashes.
"We'll probably see more of a hybrid-type engine,” McReynolds said.
