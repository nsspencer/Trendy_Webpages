     Hield helps Pacers rally from 24 down to beat Bulls 117-113
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Buddy Hield made six 3-pointers in the second half and finished with 27 points, helping the Indiana Pacers rally from a 24-point deficit after the first quarter and defeat the Chicago Bulls 117-113 on Wednesday night.
Hield broke Reggie Miller’s single-season franchise record for 3-pointers on his final 3 — his 230th — with 22 games remaining.
You shoot 3s and I shoot 3s at a high level,” said Hield, the NBA leader.
“The pattern in a lot of NBA games is you get hit in the face and then you fight back,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said.
“You’ve got to play your way through.”TIP-INSBulls: Had beaten the Pacers in four of five meetings.

     Bulls blow 24-point lead against Pacers, extending skid to five games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS — The Bulls came into Gainbridge Fieldhouse attempting to end a four-game skid.
“We compete pretty hard but what happens is the game gets ratcheted up, physically, mentally and emotionally,” coach Billy Donovan said.
But in the final seconds when the Bulls needed a clutch bucket from their max player, he came up short.
The Pacers outscored the Bulls 40-28 in the third as the urgency the Bulls have been so desperately searching for once again eluded them.
The Bulls forced 19 Pacers turnovers and converted them into 23 points.

     Are Zach LaVine’s Days In A Chicago Bulls’ Uniform Numbered?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Staring down the barrel of a season where the Chicago Bulls miss the postseason entirely, some franchise-altering decisions are set to be made.
One of the most significant will be what happens with the recently signed Zach LaVine.
According to @thekapman on @ESPN1000, Zach LaVine's relationship with head coach Billy Donovan "has sailed" and everyone else in the Chicago Bulls locker room is on Donovan's side.
Zach LaVine on getting benched down the stretch: “That’s Billy’s decision, he got to lay with it.
Nevertheless, this season, LaVine’s points, assists, and three-point percentage are all lower than ever since his first year in Chicago.

     Billy Donovan cites lost composure as Bulls blow 24-point lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What Karnišovas saw Wednesday night was a Chicago Bulls team that lost composure---again---and lost for a season-high fifth straight time, blowing a 24-point lead in a 117-113 meltdown to the Indiana Pacers.
Lost composure is what coach Billy Donovan cited as the main reason the Bulls lost on a night they snapped out of their long-distance shooting slump with 15 3-pointers and a monster game from Zach LaVine.
He finished with 35 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists on a night the Bulls played without DeMar DeRozan.
The loss ties for the second-largest blown lead of the NBA season and also marks the fifth time the Bulls have lost at least a 16-point lead this season.

     Four observations: Pacers rally back from down 24 to stun Bulls
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS -- The Pacers rallied back from 24 points down to beat the Bulls 117-113 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Wednesday night, snapping a five-game losing streak.
Turner said there was a difference in attitude, but that the Pacers also purposefully became more unpredictable.
It was the second time this season the Pacers have come back to beat the Bulls after falling behind by at least 20.
Offensively, they had fewer field goals (five) than turnovers (seven), shooting 5 of 18 from the field while the Bulls were 15 of 24.
The Pacers made 13 of their first 14 field-goal attempts and finished 15 of 20 in the period, outscoring the Bulls 40-28.
