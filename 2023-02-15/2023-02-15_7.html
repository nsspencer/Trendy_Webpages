     Tennessee loss reminds again Alabama basketball isn't invincible. Can Tide learn from it?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nonetheless, there was reason for Crimson Tide fans to celebrate it this past week when Alabama basketball finally landed back in the top spot for the first time since 2002.
It was indeed a feather in coach Nate Oats’ cap as he continues to build the Crimson Tide into a national basketball brand.
But there are moments, like in Knoxville and Norman, Oklahoma, where the Crimson Tide (22-4, 12-1 SEC) has shown it is not invincible.
“Houston’s physicality and pressure bothered us early, but I thought we settled in and did a better job late,” Oats said.
Whether it will be able to win a similar game in the postseason will depend on whether the Crimson Tide can truly learn from the Tennessee loss and get better.

     Summary: Nate Oats and the Alabama men’s basketball team dropped its first SEC game of the season on Wednesday night with a 68-59 loss to the Tennessee Volunteers.
It isn’t surprising that Alabama’s perfect run in the SEC came to an end against a Tennessee team who was in desperate need of a win after back-to-back losses on buzzer-beaters.
Even with the loss, Alabama is in firm control of first place in the SEC with five games remaining in the regular season.
Turnovers played a massive part in Alabama’s loss in Knoxville.
Let’s take a look at Alabama’s stat leaders from Wednesday night’s loss.
