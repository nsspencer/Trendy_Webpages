     Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey First Reactions Surface for "Absurdly Entertaining" Movie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a whirlwind press tour, Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey has entered cinemas for an incredibly limited theatrical run.
Now that fans have had a chance to see it, they've begun to review the film across social media.
Surprising most, it seems the early reactions are generally positive with some even hoping to see the project turn into a franchise.
"We have been overwhelmed with the enthusiastic response from the public," executive producer Stuart Alson previously said in a statement regarding the film's press cycle.
"From top media companies ranging from Rolling Stone magazine to USA Today to TMZ to individual comments on Reddit and YouTube—the world is craving Blood and Honey, and we're thrilled to be teaming up with Fathom to deliver Winnie-The-Pooh as never seen before."

     How the Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey Horror Movie Even Exists
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I think everybody does.” Indeed, most people would agree with that statement about the guileless toy bear who embarked on imaginary adventures with his fellow plush animals and human pal Christopher Robin.
But then again, not everybody is making their feature film debut with Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey.
Of course everyone has the same question when they hear about Frake-Waterfield’s movie: How can you get away with this?!
However, the character himself was created in 1926 in the children’s book, Winnie-the-Pooh, which is in the public domain as of Jan. 1, 2022.
A. Milne and illustrated by E.H. Shepherd, Winnie-the-Pooh introduced the world to the Hundred Acre Wood where young Christopher Robin sees his stuffed toys come to life.

     The Gory ‘Winnie-the-Pooh’ Slasher Movie Wants to Traumatize You
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey’s central gimmick is that it features author A.A. Milne’s beloved children’s characters as rampaging murderers.
Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey, which is now in theaters, only exists because Milne’s original 1926 book, Winnie-the-Pooh, entered the public domain last year.
Thus, to avoid copyright-infringement violations, Frake-Waterfield’s Pooh doesn’t utter any of his famous exclamations (“Oh, bother!”), nor does he hang out with springy Tigger.
It takes mere moments to comprehend why Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey’s distributors didn’t screen it for critics in advance of its theatrical debut.
Such absurdity is emblematic of Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey, as Frake-Waterfield’s script boasts neither general nor internal logic.

     ‘Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey’ Review: An Un-Bear-Able Horror Cheapie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first (and, let’s hope, worst) consequence of that development is “Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,” a rock-bottom joint that fails to meet even the most basic expectations set up by its conceptual gimmick.
Indeed, a narrator starts off explaining that young Christopher Robin befriended a group of “crossbreeds, abominations” (as opposed to nursery toys) as a wee lad, keeping them tame and well-fed from the family larder.
This backstory is accompanied by some very simple line-drawing animation, which is underwhelming but turns out to be the best thing “Blood and Honey” has to offer.
Then we’ve got grown-up, live-action Christopher Robin (Nikolai Leon) returning to the forest to introduce his old pals to his wife (Paula Coiz).
It’s bad enough that the film doesn’t have the smarts to actually satirize its inspirational source.

     Summary: Acquired by Fathom Events, the anticipated slasher horror twist on A.A. Milne’s beloved bear hits theaters nationwide February 15th.
In advance of the event cinema release, Boxoffice Pro spoke with director, writer, and producer Rhys Frake-Waterfield about the film’s theatrical release and his plans for further twisted tales.
It piques people’s interest, because when you hear, ‘I’ve made a Winnie-the-Pooh horror film’, straight away people are like, ‘What?’ They become really curious.
We’ll try and make a really good Winnie-the-Pooh horror film.’ They said yes, so we both put 50/50 in and then kind of ran with the idea.
We had a discussion with them, but we thought, ‘No, we’ll try and do a theatrical release, because we think there’s the interest there.

     Summary: As elitist as the studio heads could be about horror films, they could not argue with the bottom line.
In lesser hands, Gogol would be a caricature, but Peter Lorre navigates the subtleties of the performance in ways that only a master actor could.
Also, Dr. Gogol has an organ in his house which he plays as though he were a particularly deranged Phantom of the Opera.
Mad Love itself stands as one of the great body horror films of the 1930s.
Though these ideas are generally dismissed, it did draw attention to the all-but-forgotten Mad Love and in the early 70s, it began to develop a cult following.

     Summary: But in “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey,” a new microbudget R-rated horror film, Pooh wades into far darker territory than even Eeyore could have ever imagined.
Countless cherished characters have passed into public domain before, but perhaps never so abruptly and savagely as Pooh.
But “Winnie Pooh: Blood and Honey” may just be a taste of what’s in store.
“When Superman and Batman fall into the public domain, there’s going to be some wild films, I’m sure of it,” says “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey” writer, director and co-producer Rhys Waterfield.
To her, “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey” may not be the most glorious example of the effects of public domain, but it’s part of a process that human creativity depends upon and thrives on.
