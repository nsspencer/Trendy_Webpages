     La Liga's Barcelona Downplays Payments for Refereeing Reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barcelona denied a possible conflict of interest on Wednesday for having made payments for technical reports on referees to a company that belonged to the vice president of the refereeing committee in Spain.
The payments for information on how referees officiate were made from 2016-18 and totaled 1.4 million euros ($1.5 million), according to radio station SER Catalunya.
The station said the company hired by Barcelona belonged to former referee José María Enríquez Negreira, who was a part of the Spanish soccer federation’s refereeing committee from 1994-2018.
“The refereeing committee regrets behavior that could be considered unethical,” the federation said in a statement.
Barcelona president Joan Laporta said the news about the payments was released now to try to destabilize the team’s good run.

     FC Barcelona May Face La Liga Relegation Following $1.5 Million Referee Payment Allegations, Denies Wrongdoing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FC Barcelona have been accused of paying $1.5 million to a refereeing committee vice president ... [+] during the rule of ex-president Josep Bartomeu.
From 2016 to 2018, the Barcelona Prosecutor's Office alleges, Barca paid the amount to a company he owned named DASNIL 95.
When testifying before the prosecutor's office, Negreira and his son have denied that Barca ever received any preferential treatment as per refereeing decisions.
Thus far, however, Negreira has reportedly been unable to produce any document that proves he provided these types of services for FC Barcelona.
As raised by El Confidencial journalist Albert Ortega, however, it is interesting that Barca weren't awarded a single penalty for 78 consecutive La Liga matches during the period being investigated by the Prosecutor's Office.

     Summary: Barcelona could be hit with severe punishments after a report claimed they paid £1.2 million to a referee chief’s company between 2016 and 2018.
Image: AlamyThe Athletic reports payments were made through a company called DASNIL 95, which was set up by Enriquez Negreira and saw his son involved in the day-to-day running.
When testifying as part of an investigation into corruption, the pair denied any wrongdoing and say payments made were in relation to expert advice being given on behaviours towards different referees.
They also fumed over the timing of the news, which comes as they sit 11 points clear at the top of La Liga.
If Barca were to be found guilty, they would be at risk of relegation or having points docked.
