     Bruins take down Stars in an overtime thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you decided to suddenly — and perhaps finally — undo your learning of how calendars and seasons work, you could’ve easily envisioned Tuesday’s showdown between the Bruins and Stars as being worth more than two points.
Maybe even, say, a 35-pound drinking cup with an oversized handle full of players and coaches from the past?
In what was a showdown of the East’s best and the West’s best, the Bruins and Stars did not disappoint, as the sides traded saves, punches, and goals for over 63 minutes of play before David Pastrnak sent the crowd up to their feet and towards the exits with a bomb that put him on his pants.

DALLAS — David Pastrnak scored with 1:16 remaining in overtime, and the Boston Bruins rallied for a 3-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on Tuesday night in a matchup of the top team in each conference.
The Stars couldn't convert on 57 seconds of a 5-on-3 power play in the second period and a two-minute 4-on-3 session in the extra period.

     Summary: Which could mean general manager Don Sweeney decides to stand pat leading up to the March 3 trade deadline.
Sweeney has been an active deadline deal-maker ever since taking over the front office in 2015.
Adding Hampus Lindholm last March, along with signing him to an eight-year contract extension, one day could stand as the best move of Sweeney’s tenure.
But so was landing Lindholm, a today/tomorrow move Sweeney pulled off again without paring current roster assets.
O’Reilly, essential to the Blues’ win over the Bruins in the ‘19 Final, last week celebrated his 32nd birthday.

Here are five takeaways from the Bruins’ win.
He never quite reached his ceiling while in New Jersey, but Zacha has been a seamless fit as a member of the Bruins.

88 THE GREAT 🚨 pic.twitter.com/UphZTkb6m6 — Boston Bruins (@NHLBruins) February 15, 2023The Bruins didn’t make it easy on themselves.
Another penalty kill stood in Boston’s path to victory, this time with Marchand in the box for interference.
Brandon Carlo and Derek Forbort put together an iron man penalty kill, absorbing as much rubber as possible during the 4-on-3 situation.
As good as their penalty kill performed Tuesday night, the struggling power play was anything but efficient.

The B’s bloodlines had plenty to cheer about in Dallas, especially Pavel Zacha’s sister, Leona.
With his two-point showing against the Stars, Zacha has now hit a new career high with 37 points through 53 games this season.
Pastrnak’s game-winner was a much-needed result for the Bruins, who entered Tuesday’s matchup stuck in a 1-3-1 rut.
And as expected, the whole Bruins roster was greeted by their raucous brothers and sisters following the dramatic victory.

The good news for the Avs (and the many bettors who have backed Colorado in the NHL Stanley Cup futures market)?
That’s one reason why the Avs join Boston and Carolina as the only teams that currently sport single-digit Stanley Cup odds.
On the flip side, several clubs have seen their Stanley Cup odds rise significantly in the last two months.
