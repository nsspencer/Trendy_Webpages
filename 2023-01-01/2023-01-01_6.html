     Hundreds of Pasadena Company’s Discrete Barriers Create Protective ‘Steel Line’ Along Rose Parade Route – Pasadena Now
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meridian Rapid Defense Group’s Archer 1200 Barriers will be installed on every cross street of the five-and-a-half-mile Rose Parade route to ensure the safety of tens of thousands of spectators joining the iconic New Year’s Day tradition.
According to Peter Whitford, CEO of Pasadena-based Meridian, the nearly 600 barriers will be deployed by Sunday night before the parade.
Interim Police Chief Jason Clawson said the parade route will feature heavy security.
In 2018 and 2019, the Police Department utilized Archer Barriers to secure the Rose Bowl Parade route and the Rose Bowl Game after concluding the security being provided by water-filled barriers was inadequate.
In the same year, the City Council passed a renewed five-year contract with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) costing $1.9 million per year for supplemental law enforcement services for the Rose Parade and the Rose Bowl.
