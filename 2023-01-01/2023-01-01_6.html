     Summary: All they have to do is beat the New Orleans Saints in their Week 17 matchup.
And even though they’re 6-9, the Saints aren’t eliminated yet.
We don’t have the official inactives report yet as it is released an hour and a half before kickoff, but we know which players are definitely not playing.
After missing last week’s game, he’s listed as doubtful this week, though there was some talk that he had an outside chance of playing this week.
The Saints will be without safety Marcus Maye (shoulder), guard Andrus Peat (ankle), running back Dwayne Washington (illness).

     Summary: The New Orleans Saints are getting some much-needed reinforcements for Week 17’s climactic game with the Philadelphia Eagles.
A loss on Sunday eliminates the Saints from playoff contention — so it’s good to see cornerback Marshon Lattimore and wide receiver Chris Olave up for this game.
Starting linebacker Pete Werner is also available after a hamstring injury sidelined him.
Lattimore hasn’t played since exiting Week 5’s game with an abdominal injury that included a lacerated kidney and two broken ribs.
