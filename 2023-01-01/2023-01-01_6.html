    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the Seahawks to make the playoffs, they need to beat the Rams at home next weekend, and they also need a Lions win over the Packers or a tie between those two teams.
In the event of a Lions win and a Seahawks win, the Seahawks would hold the tiebreaker by virtue of their head-to-head victory, whereas if the Packers and Seahawks both finish 9-8, Green Bay would advance due to a better conference record.

     Seahawks keep playoff hopes alive with win, eliminate Jets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Smith threw two first-half touchdowns, Kenneth Walker III rushed for 133 yards and the Seahawks kept alive their postseason hopes with a 23-6 win Sunday that eliminated the New York Jets from playoff contention.
The Seahawks must win and hope for a loss or tie by Green Bay against Detroit to reach the postseason.
Smith also completed a three-game sweep of his former employers this season with previous wins over the Chargers and Giants.
Mike White returned at quarterback for the Jets after missing two games with fractured ribs, but offensive success was fleeting for the Jets.
White was sacked four times and the Jets failed to run an offensive play inside Seattle's 20 the entire game.

     Takeaways from Seahawks 23-6 win over Jets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here are the takeaways from the Seahawks' win over the Jets:â€“ Defense plays well outside of some continued tackling issues.
It's also the first game this season the Seahawks' offense didn't turn the ball over at least once.
Taylor was a frequent presence in the Jets' backfield and gave former Seahawks tackles Duane Brown and George Fant problems.
And then there's a lot of counter stuff that happens from there but he's really getting on the edge really well and doing a great job."
The Seahawks beat the Los Angeles Chargers 37-23, the New York Giants 27-13 and the Jets 23-6.
