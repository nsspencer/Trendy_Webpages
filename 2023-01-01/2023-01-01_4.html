     Nottingham Forest vs Chelsea: Lineups and LIVE updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea will hope to revive their Premier League campaign with a win against 19th-placed Nottingham Forest.
Chelsea's season has been in tatters so far, languishing in 9th place in the Premier League table.
The Blues have collected just 4 points in the last 5 games.
To think of it, Nottingham Forest have managed to collect 7 points in their last 5 games.
Injuries to key players has forced new Chelsea manager Graham Potter to tinker with his tactics and formations, which has backfired more often than not.

     Nottingham Forest vs Chelsea lineups
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cesar Azpilicueta returns to the side in place of Reece James for a record-breaking appearance.
Nottingham Forest vs Chelsea lineupsGraham Potter has made one change to the side which beat Bournemouth 2-0 in our final match of last year as we begin 2023 away at Nottingham Forest.
It will be the Spaniard’s 495th game for Chelsea, putting him clear of Petr Cech’s total as our highest overseas appearance maker of all time.
The defence is otherwise unchanged, meaning Marc Cucurella continues on the left while Thiago Silva and Kalidou Koulibaly are in the middle, ahead of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.
There are no changes in attack either, where Christian Pulisic, Raheem Sterling and Kai Havertz remain.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Welcome to 2023!
Chelsea mark New Year’s Day with our first trip to the City Ground in the 21st century, with a fixture not seen in over 23 years.
Nottingham Forest’s return to the Premier League has not been without struggle however, and they sit just one above the very bottom of the table.
But their recent form has been better than ours, although they did lose their last game whereas we finally won one.
Potter sticks with the same team as on Tuesday, with the one enforced (and quite significant) change of Azpilicueta deputizing for the injured Reece James.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Goodnight from the City GroundA new year, but the same old problems for Chelsea.
The Blues have now won just one of their last seven Premier League games, and once again looked short of ideas up front in this draw at the City Ground.
Yet there is hope to bring in 2023 for Nottingham Forest, who exposed Chelsea's soft centre in the second half.
There's a chance for both clubs to prove themselves immediately with a full round of Premier League games scheduled for midweek.
The fixtures start tomorrow with Brentford hosting Liverpool, and the best place to follow the action is with us here at SunSport.
