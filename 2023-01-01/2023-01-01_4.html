     Mavericks' Luka Doncic: Shines with 51-point game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doncic logged 51 points (18-29 FG, 6-10 3Pt, 9-15 FT), six rebounds, nine assists, one block and four steals across 37 minutes during Saturday's 126-125 victory over the Spurs.
Doncic had one of the best weeks of any player in league history, topping the 30-point mark in each of those contests and reaching the 50-point mark twice in that span.
In fact, he's now posted 50 or more points in three of his last five contests, racking up two triple-doubles and one double-double in that span.
It's getting harder and harder to mention adjectives for Doncic's recent performances, and he's making a statement right now that he may be the best player in the entire Association.
