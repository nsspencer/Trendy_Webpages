     Summary: The Washington Commanders have unveiled a new mascot and, as the team tweeted, "he's kind of a pig deal."
Connecting with a historic part of the team's past, the mascot is a hog wearing a Commanders uniform.

Several members of The Hogs attended the Commanders' game Sunday against the Cleveland Browns -- the same day Major Tuddy was introduced.

     Commanders eliminated from playoff contention
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Washington Commanders' 2022 campaign will end next week at home against Dallas.
Following Sunday's loss to the Cleveland Browns and victories by the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers, the Commanders were officially eliminated from postseason contention for a second straight season.
Washington (7-8-1) entered Week 17 in control of its own playoff destiny: win the next two games and the No.
The Commanders' chaotic 2022 season can best be described in three parts.
With the Commanders officially out of postseason contention, the team could turn to rookie Sam Howell at quarterback for the regular season finale against Dallas.

     Ron Rivera considering another Commanders QB change? 'We'll see'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Commanders head coach Ron Rivera was seeking to jumpstart his offense when he reinserted Carson Wentz into the starting lineup this week, but no such spark materialized in Washington's 24-10 loss to the Cleveland Browns on Sunday.
It was the Commanders' lowest point total over the last nine games, with Taylor Heinicke starting the previous nine contests.
Rivera was thinking of another quarterback change in Week 18 after the disappointing loss.
"Well, we'll see," Rivera said of the Commanders' QB situation.
And you know Heinicke gets the ball out fast.

     Summary: Washington went from one of the worst teams in the league, to one that took down the undefeated Philadelphia Eagles in their house on Monday Night Football.
With Taylor Heinicke under center, Washington went 5-1 before they got to the Giants-bye week-Giants set of games, and then it all fell apart.
If the season would end today, Washington would have the 15th overall pick, and likely the 47th overall pick(2nd round).
Washington will end up sending their 3rd round pick to the Indianapolis Colts to finish their trade for him.
