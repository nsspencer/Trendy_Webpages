     Steelers complete comeback to beat Ravens: How Pittsburgh preserved its playoff hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Steelers beat the Ravens 16-13 on Sunday night to preserve their playoff hopes.
Per Austin Mock’s model, the Steelers’ playoff odds jumped from 2.3 percent entering Week 17 to 18.1 percent after beating the Ravens.
— ZrebiecRun defense deserves brunt of blameOne of the few constants in this Ravens season has been their run defense.
The Ravens entered Sunday with the league’s third-best run defense, holding the opposition to 87.5 yards per game on the ground.
Pickett made some great throws late, but it was the Steelers’ run game that controlled the game.

     Kenny Pickett leads another Steelers comeback to keep playoffs in sight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kenny Pickett scrambles to his left and connects with Najee Harris for a go-ahead touchdown late in the fourth quarter.
Pickett was 3-of-4 -- including the touchdown -- on throws traveling at least 10 yards downfield on that final drive.
With a complementary run game that racked up 198 rushing yards, Pickett finished the night having completed 15 of 27 attempts for 168 yards with one touchdown.
Still, the Steelers had no doubt they were going to score when they took the field for their final drive.
The Steelers' offense believed in Pickett from the minute he took over as quarterback, even when the team was 2-6 at the bye.

     Summary: Fans exit the stadium and beat writers finish tweets before heading to the elevators toward their respective post-game press conferences.
11:35 — Media start to notice Washington cycle between him placing his head in his hands or the 1,000-yard stare he has when looking forward.
He looks to his left where veteran defensive end Calais Campbell, who missed tonight’s game due to a knee injury, signals to the young player with his hands to settle himself down.
He does it each time during post-practice pressers, and he’s still noble enough to do so after a painful loss.
11:45 — Another nod to himself and Washington stands up and meets a trainer to help strip off the sweat-soaked jersey.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: QUARTERBACK:The Pittsburgh Steelers are clinging on to playoff hopes as they travel to take on the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday Night Football, giving us a DFS showdown slate.
Huntley won’t be asked to do much, as he’s only averaged 132 yards passing per game.
The Steelers have not won four of their last five games because of Kenny Pickett, but his ceiling won’t be too special.
He’s prime for the showdown, too, as he’s found the endzone in four of his last six games.
Pat Freiermuth has taken the leap this year and has developed a strong connection with Pickett that Steelers fans should be excited about.
