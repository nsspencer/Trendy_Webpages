     Mavericks' Luka Doncic: Shines with 51-point game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doncic logged 51 points (18-29 FG, 6-10 3Pt, 9-15 FT), six rebounds, nine assists, one block and four steals across 37 minutes during Saturday's 126-125 victory over the Spurs.
Doncic had one of the best weeks of any player in league history, topping the 30-point mark in each of those contests and reaching the 50-point mark twice in that span.
In fact, he's now posted 50 or more points in three of his last five contests, racking up two triple-doubles and one double-double in that span.
It's getting harder and harder to mention adjectives for Doncic's recent performances, and he's making a statement right now that he may be the best player in the entire Association.

     Summary: On New Year’s Eve, Minnesota got handled by a Detroit team leaning into its bench, 116-104 — that’s six straight losses and 9-of-12 for the Timberwolves, and they are 6-10 since Towns went out injured.
That led to several things, including a players-only meeting after the game.
Chris Finch on what he can do as a coach to improve the effort: “Just try to be honest with them, as honest as possible.
All that said, this is a decent team when KAT has played, injuries are part of it.
The Timberwolves front office didn’t send out that massive haul of picks and players to Utah last summer to be decent when everyone is healthy.
