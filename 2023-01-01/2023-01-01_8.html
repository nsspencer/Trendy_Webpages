     Chelsea sign Benoit Badiashile in deal for French defender
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea have reached an agreement with AS Monaco to sign young French defender Benoit Badiashile for an estimated fee worth £32.7 million ($39 million).
Chelsea had lost Antonio Rudiger, Marcos Alonso and Andreas Christensen in the summer who left to ply their trade in Spain.
And now after a stellar World Cup, Gvardiol’s asking price is expected to skyrocket for any potential suitors.
Chelsea sign Benoit Badiashile after competition from fellow clubsBadiashile had attracted interest from Manchester United last season and most recently Newcastle United who were also ready to meet Monaco’s asking price for the player.
Chelsea are looking at signing Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernandez who was the young player of the tournament in the recently concluded World Cup in Qatar.

     Chelsea Frustrated In Damaging Draw At Lowly Forest
    </h2>

     Summary: But Ivory Coast defender Serge Aurier levelled after the break and Chelsea were fortunate to escape without an embarrassing defeat after Forest dominated for long spells in the second half.
Chelsea are languishing in eighth place after failing to win for the sixth time in their last seven league games.
"We need to have a very good second half of the season if we want to play in the Champions League next season."
Forest are third bottom having won just three games all season, but boss Steve Cooper will take heart from the way his team rattled Chelsea in the second half.
With Chelsea strangely subdued in the second half, Forest's pressure paid off in the 63rd minute.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NOTTINGHAM, England, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Chelsea dropped more points in their quest to climb back up the Premier League standings as Serge Aurier earned Nottingham Forest a 1-1 draw with Graham Potter's side on Sunday.
Forest improved after the break and were desperately unlucky not to equalise early in the second half as Morgan Gibbs-White's drilled half volley hit the underside of the crossbar but bounced on the goal line and away.
They could not complete the turnaround, however, with Chelsea hanging on for a point that leaves them eighth in the standings, seven points behind Manchester United in fourth.
The hosts remain in the relegation zone but climbed to 18th, level on 14 points with West Ham United above them.
The second half we didn't control it well enough."

DF Kalidou Koulibaly, 4 -- Moved the ball impressively in the first half, setting up chances for Mason Mount and Christian Pulisic.
Kalidou Koulibaly, left, found it difficult when Nottingham Forest began to pull the Chelsea centre-back into wider areas.

     Fernandez, Felix &amp; eight players Chelsea could sign in the January transfer window
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the anomaly of a mid-season 'pre-season', new Blues boss Graham Potter can now shape the squad in his image with some new facesHaving already had the unusual benefit of a six-week period to work closely with those players who were not involved in the World Cup in Qatar, away from scrutiny and the public eye, recently-appointed Chelsea manager Graham Potter now has an opportune transfer window to fine tune his squad.
However, a sharp downturn in form before the World Cup break means Potter and new owner Todd Boehly probably have more work on their hands than they bargained for - especially after the lavish summer outlay on the likes of Raheem Sterling, Kalidou Koulibaly, Marc Cucurella and Wesley Fofana.
The question those in charge will need to ask themselves is whether cosmetic changes in the new year will be enough, or whether a complete overhaul is required for a squad that has stagnated in certain areas - one that will likely have to wait until the summer.
Molde forward David Datro Fofana has already been brought in, but he is unlikely to be the last new fact at Stamford Bridge over the winter.
So if Chelsea do decide to enter the market again in January, GOAL runs through eight players they could consider to improve their fortunes...
