     Summary: Chelsea have reached an agreement with AS Monaco to sign young French defender Benoit Badiashile for an estimated fee worth £32.7 million ($39 million).
Chelsea had lost Antonio Rudiger, Marcos Alonso and Andreas Christensen in the summer who left to ply their trade in Spain.
And now after a stellar World Cup, Gvardiol’s asking price is expected to skyrocket for any potential suitors.
Chelsea sign Benoit Badiashile after competition from fellow clubsBadiashile had attracted interest from Manchester United last season and most recently Newcastle United who were also ready to meet Monaco’s asking price for the player.
Chelsea are looking at signing Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernandez who was the young player of the tournament in the recently concluded World Cup in Qatar.

     Summary: Nottingham (United Kingdom) (AFP) – Chelsea's spluttering Premier League campaign took a turn for the worse as Serge Aurier's equaliser gave lowly Nottingham Forest a 1-1 draw on Sunday.
Advertising Read moreRaheem Sterling put Chelsea ahead at the City Ground in the first half of their opening game in 2023.
But Ivory Coast right-back Aurier levelled after the break and Chelsea were fortunate to escape without an embarrassing defeat after Forest dominated for long spells in the second half.
With Chelsea strangely subdued in the second half, Forest's pressure paid off in the 63rd minute.
Aurier's first goal for Forest since his September move from Villarreal left Chelsea reeling.

Chelsea have agreed personal terms with Badiashile on long-term contract and his medical is in process of being scheduled.

They had agreed personal terms with Josko Gvardiol but were unable to strike a deal with RB Leipzig over a transfer fee for the 20-year-old.

     Summary: Nottingham Forest gave its Premier League survival hopes a boost with a 1-1 draw against Chelsea, whose troubles on the road continued Sunday.
The hosts put in a good second-half display which was rewarded with Serge Aurier’s equalizer just after the hour mark.
Forest said in a statement shortly after fulltime: “The club are aware of reports concerning chants aimed at Chelsea supporters from a minority of fans this evening and do not condone any type of discriminatory or offensive behaviour.
Sterling was waiting eagerly to fire home the rebound for his first Premier League goal since August.
Chelsea failed to clear a corner and the former Tottenham defender controlled Boly’s header with his chest and then lashed home.

     Summary: NOTTINGHAM, England, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Chelsea dropped more points in their quest to climb back up the Premier League standings as Serge Aurier earned Nottingham Forest a 1-1 draw with Graham Potter's side on Sunday.
Forest improved after the break and were desperately unlucky not to equalise early in the second half as Morgan Gibbs-White's drilled half volley hit the underside of the crossbar but bounced on the goal line and away.
They could not complete the turnaround, however, with Chelsea hanging on for a point that leaves them eighth in the standings, seven points behind Manchester United in fourth.
The hosts remain in the relegation zone but climbed to 18th, level on 14 points with West Ham United above them.
