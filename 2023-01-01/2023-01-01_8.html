     Summary: The Kansas City Chiefs moved to 13-3 with their win on New Year’s Day over the Denver Broncos, but here are some resolutions to make them even better.
The Kansas City Chiefs won another frustrating game on Sunday when they beat the Denver Broncos 27-24.
Just two weeks ago I wrote that this Chiefs team is simultaneously both great and a mess and I think we saw this once again on Sunday.
I thought I’d come up with a top ten list of New Year’s resolutions for the Kansas City Chiefs.
If Toney can do whatever it takes to stay healthy he provides the Chiefs with a much-needed offensive weapon.

     Four Takeaways From the Chiefs' 27-24 Win Over the Broncos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Entering Week 17, the Kansas City Chiefs were still very much alive in the hunt for the AFC's top playoff seed.
While it remains to be seen whether the Cincinnati Bengals can help them out on Monday, Kansas City held up their end of the bargain on Sunday by defeating the visiting Denver Broncos by a final score of 27-24.
For good measure, he added another one later on that broke the franchise record for touchdown catches by a Chiefs running back in a single season.
Allowing just 13 points, Wilson wasn't gashing Kansas City through the air and punter Corliss Waitman was getting plenty of work.
The Chiefs' defense seems to be improving a bit, but there are still things to figure out as the playoffs approach.
