     Raiders' Jarrett Stidham finds Davante Adams for 60-yard TD
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LAS VEGAS -- Quarterback Jarrett Stidham, making his first career start, looked like a nine-year veteran in throwing a 60-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams early in the third quarter Sunday.
The score gave the Las Vegas Raiders a 24-14 lead over the San Francisco 49ers.
Stidham was hit hard on the play by Talanoa Hufanga and Samson Ebukam while waiting for Adams to break free downfield.
He replaced quarterback Derek Carr, who has left the team in the wake of his Wednesday benching in a mutual decision.
After the big play, Stidham was 3-for-3 for 108 yards and two touchdowns on passes thrown 20 or more air yards downfield.

     49ers report card: Grading offense, defense in Week 17 win vs. Raiders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LAS VEGAS — The 49ers’ defense played a very un-49ers-defense-like game on New Year's Day.
The 49ers might have underestimated Las Vegas Raiders starting quarterback Jarrett Stidham, as defensive end Nick Bosa said.
But, ultimately, the defense came through with the play of the game in the 49ers’ 37-34 overtime victory at Allegiant Stadium on Sunday.
Grade: ARushing defenseThis was not like the 49ers’ defense to get pushed around like this.
The other big play from the defense was Drake Jackson’s interception off a pass that Kerry Hyder deflected.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Las Vegas Raiders are re-evaluating the quarterback position and are on the doorstep of a seismic shift under center this offseason.
In the 37-34 overtime loss to San Francisco, Stidham played well, throwing for 365 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.
Those three passing touchdowns are tied for the most by a quarterback making his first NFL start in Raiders history.
While his play helped force overtime, Stidham didn't have enough magic left in the tank to fully pull off the upset.
He spent the first three seasons of his career in New England before being traded to Las Vegas this offseason as the two clubs swapped Day 3 draft picks.

     Summary: Playing in front of a raucous pro-49ers crowd as visitors in Las Vegas, San Francisco was pushed like it seldom has been during what's now a nine-game winning streak.
San Francisco also has a shot at the No.
San Francisco overcame a rare off day from what was the league's top-ranked defense entering the game.
“I didn't feel like I had really any nerves at all this week,” Stidham said.
But Purdy was even better, throwing two touchdown passes to put San Francisco ahead 14-10 early in the second quarter.

     Summary: Here are the winners and losers for the week after Las Vegas officially dropped out of the playoff race with a 6-9 record.
That’s a win for the Raiders, too, as there’s clearly life in Las Vegas after Carr — Adams’ college friend — was benched.
But he’s still on the roster, and as a result of Stidham’s quality game, he’s on the Loser list.
But after being dumped as Las Vegas’ franchise QB, the Raiders didn’t miss him at all.
Second, he allowed 49ers DE Nick Bosa to bull rush him into Stidham on Stidham’s overtime interception, sealing Las Vegas’ fate.
