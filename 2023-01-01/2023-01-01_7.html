     Chiefs Injury Updates on Skyy Moore and Others Following Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The team accumulated multiple injuries throughout the game, with some of them being of different severities than others.
Following a fourth-quarter interception, cornerback L'Jarius Sneed took a hard hit on the return and left the game briefly with a hip injury before later coming back in.
Rookie wide receiver Skyy Moore left for the locker room in the second half and was quickly ruled out with a hand injury, leaving the Chiefs a bit shorthanded at the receiver spot.
After the game, head coach Andy Reid took the podium and immediately addressed his team's injury situation.
All things considered, especially when looking at the alternatives, the Chiefs managed to avoid letting disaster strike.

     After Chiefs win, all eyes turn to Bills at Bengals on Monday Night Football
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KANSAS CITY, Mo.
The Buffalo Bills (12-3) entered the week atop of the conference standings, but they need a win Monday at Cincinnati to keep pace after the Kansas City Chiefs improved to 13-3 with a 27-24 win Sunday against Denver .
The Chiefs lost to both the Bills and Bengals earlier in the season, so they don’t hold tiebreakers against either team.
“It’s going to be a great football game with two great teams — and teams you’re probably going to see in the playoffs.
It’s great quarterbacks, great defenses, great players.
