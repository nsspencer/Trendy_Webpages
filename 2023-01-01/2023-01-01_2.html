     Summary: Cesar Azpilicueta returns to the side in place of Reece James for a record-breaking appearance.
Nottingham Forest vs Chelsea lineupsGraham Potter has made one change to the side which beat Bournemouth 2-0 in our final match of last year as we begin 2023 away at Nottingham Forest.
It will be the Spaniard’s 495th game for Chelsea, putting him clear of Petr Cech’s total as our highest overseas appearance maker of all time.
The defence is otherwise unchanged, meaning Marc Cucurella continues on the left while Thiago Silva and Kalidou Koulibaly are in the middle, ahead of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.
There are no changes in attack either, where Christian Pulisic, Raheem Sterling and Kai Havertz remain.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea lost further ground in their battle to make the Premier League top four as they were held to a 1-1 draw by a stubborn Nottingham Forest side.
Raheem Sterling put Chelsea ahead at Forest's City Ground in the 16th minute, before Serge Aurier drew the teams level with an acrobatic finish in the 63rd minute.
But Chelsea took the lead when Sterling took full advantage after a bizarre attempted clearance from Willy Boly bounced off the bar.
Forest finally found the breakthrough when Aurier steered a volley past Kepa after Chelsea failed to clear a corner, with the right-back celebrating the equaliser wildly.
Aubameyang then failed to connect with a fizzing Hakim Ziyech cross as Chelsea searched for a second goal, but Potter's side fell short.
