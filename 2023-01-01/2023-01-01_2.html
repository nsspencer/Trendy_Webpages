     Anita Pointer of The Pointer Sisters Dead at 74
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anita Pointer, the preacher’s daughter who gained fame as a member of the Pointer Sisters with hits like “I’m So Excited” and “Jump (For My Love),” died at her Beverly Hills home at the age of 74.
A spokesman said the cause of death was cancer and that the three-time Grammy winner was surrounded by loved ones.
She and her sisters sharpened their talent in the church choir before Bonnie and June formed a duet that became a trio when Anita joined it.
Sister Ruth eventually came on board The Pointer Sisters, which was at times a quartet and other times a trio.
She was supposed to appear on The Masked Singer with sister Ruth in 2021—as a cupcake—but she had to bow out because of illness.
