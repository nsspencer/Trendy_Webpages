     Robert Griffin III’s Wife ‘Still Pregnant’ After Fiesta Bowl False Alarm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Robert Griffin III showed that he still has some serious wheels when he hooked it off-camera during the Fiesta Bowl because his wife was going into labor.
At least for the time being, because Mrs. Griffin III is still pregnant.
Grete Griffin explained in the photo that their baby girl tried to make a grand entrance a bit early.
“First off let’s start by saying that even though baby girl tried to make a dramatic entrance last night into 2023, she decided it wasn’t time yet,” she wrote.
Smart guy, that Robert Griffin III.
