     6 biggest takeaways from the Vikings loss vs. Packers in Week 17
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Vikings got beaten down by the Green Bay Packer in Week 17 and there was a lot to learn from the New Year’s Day contest in Wisconsin.
Heading into Week 17, the Minnesota Vikings had an opportunity to close the gap on the top-seed Philadelphia Eagles and stay ahead of the San Francisco 49ers but they couldn’t beat the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.
It was seriously that disappointing of a game from the Vikings’ perspective.
Despite the disaster of the Minnesota Vikings in Week 17, they still have at least two more games to play before looking ahead to the offseason and can take what they learned to prepare for those games.
Here are six takeaways from the game at Green Bay.

     Vikings demolished by surging Packers, fall to No. 3 seed with 49ers win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not only did they suffer an embarrassing loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday, but the Minnesota Vikings also fell to the No.
From the second they stepped onto the slippery grass inside Lambeau Field on Sunday, the Minnesota Vikings clearly were not prepared to leave the stadium with a victory over the Green Bay Packers.
Minnesota ended up losing by a final score of 41-17 to Green Bay, a result that not even the Vikings’ biggest doubters likely expected.
1 seed in the NFC is no longer attainable for the Vikings after Sunday’s loss, but they can still finish as the No.
2 seed in the conference if they beat the Chicago Bears and the 49ers lose to the Arizona Cardinals next weekend.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa · 2 min readThe Minnesota Vikings may be 12-4 on the season, but that only looks good on the surface.
Justin Jefferson admitted as much after he was made aware that they have a negative scoring differential this campaign.
Minnesota has scored a total of 395 points, but opponents have dropped 419 on them for a point differential of -24.
“That’s crazy to think about, and that just goes to all the times that we lose and we lose by 30.
The Vikings’ ugly scoring differential is a huge proof of their defensive struggles this 2022.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Green Bay Packers’ season once seemed dead in the water, with no postseason hopes at all.
With two games left, the Packers need to win out and get some help across the league to qualify for the playoffs.
But a victory against the Minnesota Vikings this weekend at Lambeau would make a shot at the postseason exponentially more likely.
The Vikings need a win to maintain control of the No.
The Packers will rely on LaFleur’s experience to guide them to a win and pressure this Vikings team early.

     Summary: An injury that keeps O'Neill out long term is worst-case scenario for the Vikings.
If O'Neill is out long term and Bradbury doesn't get back to full health, four-fifths of the starting line will have major questions.
O'Neill's injury is especially concerning since the Vikings will likely face strong defensive lines and edge rushes in the playoffs.
The Vikings have entered the danger zone and there's no getting out of it if O'Neill's injury is long term.

The prolific QB threw three interceptions and lost a fumble as the Packers scored 41 straight points after the Vikings took an early 3-0 lead.
Without much help from star receiver Justin Jefferson and running back Dalvin Cook, Cousins couldn't carry the Vikings.
Jefferson opened the season by catching nine passes for 184 yards and two touchdowns against the Packers.
That set them behind the 8-ball for sure.”The Vikings remain confident their offense can bounce back in time for the postseason.

     Vikings at Packers Game Observations: Slip Ups on Field Mean No. 1 Seed Slides Away
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Packers next six possessions ended with the following ways: field goal, touchdown, field goal that bounced off the crossbar and through, punt, touchdown and touchdown.
The combined lack of success by Minnesota's offense and an inability to get stops on defense led to Green Bay scoring 41 consecutive points.
Alexander jammed Jefferson at the line multiple times and played with some physicality with the ball in the air.
Two plays after Minnesota stopped Green Bay with a sack by Dalvin Tomlinson on fourth-and-1, Alexander made contact on Jefferson multiple times with the ball in flight.
Alexander hit Jefferson's "The Griddy" dance to taunt him after the play.
