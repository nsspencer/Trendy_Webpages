    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LAS VEGAS — The 49ers' 37-34 overtime win over the Raiders on Sunday was a roller-coaster of emotions, but Brock Purdy appeared incredibly calm even with the pressure on his shoulders.
Keep things simple like that.”As far as his 49ers teammates can tell, Purdy is a cool customer.
San Francisco trailed late in a game for the first time since Purdy took over for an injured Jimmy Garoppolo in Week 13.
"Yeah, I think that was great for him," 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said when asked if Purdy fighting through adversity was a development point.
Even if someone else messes up, too.”Added Shanahan: "First of all, no one's ever not missed some things.

    </h2>

     Summary: LAS VEGAS — The 49ers’ defense played a very un-49ers-defense-like game on New Year's Day.
The 49ers might have underestimated Las Vegas Raiders starting quarterback Jarrett Stidham, as defensive end Nick Bosa said.
But, ultimately, the defense came through with the play of the game in the 49ers’ 37-34 overtime victory at Allegiant Stadium on Sunday.
Grade: ARushing defenseThis was not like the 49ers’ defense to get pushed around like this.
The other big play from the defense was Drake Jackson’s interception off a pass that Kerry Hyder deflected.

     Brock Purdy earns high marks for leading 49ers from behind
    </h2>

     Summary: LAS VEGAS -- Since taking over for Jimmy Garoppolo, rookie Brock Purdy has faced and passed a number of tests for the San Francisco 49ers.
But as he's done with all the other tests, Purdy earned more high marks as the 49ers won a wild 37-34 shootout against the Raiders.
It was San Francisco's ninth straight win, its longest such streak since an 11-game surge in 1997.
Purdy became the first rookie quarterback to win four straight starts since Ben Roethlisberger went 13-0 in 2004.
It was his fifth straight game with multiple touchdown passes, tied for the second-longest streak by a rookie since the 1970 merger (the Chargers' Justin Herbert did it seven straight games in 2020).
