    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saints upset Eagles, but still get eliminated from NFC playoff race Published 7:21 pm Sunday, January 1, 2023PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Cameron Jordan waved his arms in ferocious pursuit and went on another QB hunt.
The Saints won’t get a chance at the playoffs after Green Bay knocked off Minnesota and eliminated them from an NFC wild-card spot.
The Saints beat the Eagles 20-10 but were eliminated from the NFC South title race when Tampa Bay rallied to beat Carolina.
He jumped from one sack as a rookie to eight, and then to 12 1/2 in 2013.
Minshew’s interception, however, was returned 12 yards by Marshon Lattimore for a game-clinching interception with 5:27 left in the fourth quarter.

The Minnesota Vikings no long have a shot at the NFC’s top playoff seed after getting blown out by the Green Bay Packers.
If the Eagles, 49ers, and Cowboys end the season in a three-way tie at 13-4, the top NFL playoff seed would go to the team with the best conference record, which would be San Francisco.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA (WVUE) - The Saints pulled off a stunning upset of the NFC’s top team Sunday (Jan. 1), but not even a 20-10 road victory over the Eagles kept them from being eliminated from playoff contention.
The Saints’ shocker over the Eagles kept open a narrow path to an NFC wild-card bid, but only for about 3 1/2 more hours, as it turned out.
Green Bay’s 41-17 rout of the Minnesota Vikings mathematically eliminated the Saints (7-9) from playoff contention just before 6:30 p.m.
New Orleans was run out of the NFL’s playoff picture at a time when the team was finally hitting its stride.
The Saints’ victory Sunday was their season-high third in a row, coming after they forced a lackluster performance by Eagles quarterback Gardner Minshew, who was starting in place of injured MVP candidate Jalen Hurts.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All that stood between the Philadelphia Eagles and the NFC East title was a win Sunday in their home matchup against the below-.500 New Orleans Saints.
But an offense without injured Pro Bowl quarterback Jalen Hurts (shoulder) and right tackle Lane Johnson (abdominal tear) instead combusted spectacularly.
That could compel Philadelphia to rest Hurts one week longer, maintaining a recovery period that would span five weeks if the Eagles also clinch a bye.
“He made a great adjustment and made the play.”The Eagles dropped a second straight game in as many tries without Hurts.
The Eagles' loss to the Saints on Sunday might alter the timeline for Jalen Hurts' injury return.
