     Netflix Kicks Off Year with Gimmicky, Silly Kaleidoscope
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His closest ally is Ava Mercer (Paz Vega), the heist participant with the most public face as a high-profile attorney.
Like so many Netflix shows, “Kaleidoscope” struggles with mid-season sag even without a traditional season.
So many of the ideas in “Kaleidoscope” are paper-thin because it kind of requires linear storytelling to get thick.
“Kaleidoscope” is admittedly fun at times, playfully bursting into action in ways that aren’t always predictable.
There’s a strong energy between the heist crew members that made me wish that “Kaleidoscope” had unfolded in the right order.

     Summary: Episodes "Violet" and "Green" are the best way to enter the story if you want to get the backstory out of the way.
Giancarlo Esposito plays the lead Leo Pap.
Courtesy of NetflixEach episode of "Kaleidoscope" is set at a certain time in relation to the heist whether that is during the heist, before it, or after it.
Both episodes set up the motivations for the main character and mastermind of the eventual heist Leo Pap (Giancarlo Esposito).
The episode "Green" follows Leo during his prison days and his brilliant plan of escape.

     'Kaleidoscope' review: Giancarlo Esposito stars in a bland heist story with a you-pick-the-order gimmick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —The puzzle-like gimmick at the heart of “Kaleidoscope” – watch the episodes in any order that you want – can’t conceal how otherwise uninspired this “Ocean’s Eleven”-esque heist series actually is.
Chalk that up in part to stiffly written characters, familiar situations and drawn-out logistical sequences.
Color plays a prominent role in this limited series, since each of the eight episodes corresponds with a color – red, orange, white, etc.
Details thus unfold differently depending on when they’re consumed, which in theory personalizes the viewing experience.
While the meticulous planning of the heist adds zest to something like the aforementioned “Ocean’s” series, those intricacies yield less satisfying results when spread out as they inevitably are in this more expansive series format.

     Summary: There’s a new Netflix series that’s doing something really interesting—the show is non-linear, which means its eight episodes can be watched in any order.
That’s cool and all, but you might wonder how to watch Kaleidoscope in chronological order if you’re wanting a more traditional viewing experience.
Here’s how to watch the Kaleidoscope episodes in chronological order, culminating with the “White” episode.
How to watch Kaleidoscope episodes in chronological orderTo watch Kaleidoscope episodes in chronological order, it’s worth knowing in which order the episodes appear on Netflix to begin with and where they fall on the timeline.
“It’s loosely based on something that might have happened,” Garcia told Tudum.

     Kaleidoscope’s random-episode gimmick can’t save a Netflix heist show gone wrong
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At least, that’s the hope behind Netflix’s new heist series Kaleidoscope, which gives each viewer a randomized episode order.
While this format is almost interesting at first blush, its problems become clear with a little more thought: There’s nothing fundamentally interesting about learning things in a random order.
Just like a great heist, a great heist movie requires perfect timing, giving out character reveals at just the right moment, knowing when the story needs a new complication, and throwing shocking twists in at exactly the right moment for maximum audience impact.
Kaleidoscope’s pacing feels nonsensical, which might seem like it’s the obvious fault of the random order.
But, given that’s true for each of the show’s eight individual episodes, maybe that isn’t the result of the random order, but the show it’s pasted onto.

     Summary: So, let’s look at why Ray Vernon wanted to risk his life and commit a robbery and whether or not he was successful.
RJ Acosta was not a hardened criminal like Bob, but Ray knew that he would need him when the time came.
SLS made use of some high-level technology, and to break into the vault, Ray needed to know exactly how the system worked and what its weaknesses were.
Ray wanted to remind Salas of that time he had betrayed him and also leave something that would bring his dubious past to light.
Unlike Salas, Ray was imprisoned for life, and in the process, he lost almost everything he treasured.

Rule-breakers who throw the finale into the mix have a mind-boggling 40,320 ways to watch Kaleidoscope.
Watching Kaleidoscope chronologically is probably the clearest path through its story but not necessarily the most satisfying.
Viewing order: “Pink,” “Red,” “Blue,” “Orange,” “Yellow,” “Green,” “Violet,” “White”This might be an even more radical way to watch Kaleidoscope.
Then watch “Red” and “Pink,” two episodes set in the aftermath of the heist.
