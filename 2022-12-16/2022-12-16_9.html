     Summary: Ja Morant © Allison Farrand-USA TODAY SportsThe Memphis Grizzlies have quietly emerged as the top team in the Western Conference, boasting a 19-9 record after throttling the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday night.
Ja continues to improve his game for the GrizzliesOf course, at the center of everything good for the Grizzlies is Ja Morant.
Those statlines have become increasingly regular, as Morant seems more interested in getting his teammates involved rather than scoring 40 points a night.
- Charles Barkley, Inside The NBAAfter the game, Morant seemed to allude to Barkley's comments when responding to a tweet from Kendrick Perkins.
As Morant continues to improve, the Grizzlies' ceiling continues to riseBarkley's comment on Morant was made about a month ago, and the contrast in Morant's play since then has been notable.

     NBA Scores: Ja Morant’s triple-double powers the Grizzlies over a top team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ja nabs another triple-double, Grizzlies trounce Bucks, 142-101Memphis is terrifying.
This was a complete bloodbath from the jump, one in which Ja Morant recorded yet another triple-double (going for 25 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists this time).
He scored 35 points, drained nine of 17 triples, and hit the game-winner in Miami’s tight win over the Thunder on Wednesday.
On Thursday, he stepped up and then some, shooting the lights out for Miami as they eked out a win against this increasingly-plucky Houston team.
Herro continues to solidify himself as an integral starter, not merely a gimmick sixth man who actually plays starter’s minutes.
