     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. – In a bit of a role reversal, it wasn’t Tiger Woods’ health he was immediately asked about following his pro-am round Friday at the PNC Championship.
It was his son’s health that drew reporters’ attention.
Charlie Woods appeared to be favoring his left ankle and was seen limping throughout the round.
Asked after the round about his son’s condition, Tiger said, “He is [fine].
“You've got to be able to do that when [you’re] playing tournament golf.

     Charlie Woods rolled his ankle warming up for Friday's round at the PNC Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tough start to the week for Charlie Woods, and it had nothing to do with his golf game.
While warming up for Friday’s pro-am at the 2022 PNC Championship at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Charlie rolled his ankle and is hurting a bit.
During his round, Charlie had a bit of a limp and looks uncomfortable after hitting some of his shots.
Cameras showing Friday’s pro-am round captured Charlie and father Tiger Woods walking away from the 11th green, and they both had a noticeable limp.
Team Woods goes off with Team Thomas, with Justin playing with father Mike, at 12:02 p.m.

     Tiger Woods says playing with son trumps letting foot heal
    </h2>

     Summary: Woods and his son, Charlie, were both noticeably limping during Friday's pro-am at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club.
Tiger Woods, who is still recovering from injuries suffered in a car wreck outside Los Angeles in February 2021, will be able to use a cart in the 36-hole scramble.
"Any time I get a chance to spend time with my son, it's always special," Tiger said.
Because of the plantar fasciitis, Tiger said he wasn't ready to commit to a schedule for 2023.
He was forced to pull out of the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas earlier this month because of plantar fasciitis.
