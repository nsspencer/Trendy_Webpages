     Summary: Dino Danelli, the drummer who brought a jazzman's virtuosity to the rock 'n' roll sound of The Rascals, passed away Thursday in New York City, according to his Facebook page and confirmed by his bandmates.
"It is with a broken heart that I must tell you of the passing of Dino Danelli," said Rascals guitarist Gene Cornish on social media.

Van Zandt did the honors that night.
