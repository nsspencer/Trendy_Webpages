    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon announced today that it signed a deal with Games Workshop (GAW), giving it IP rights to the “Warhammer 40,000” universe, a massively popular tabletop miniature wargame.

     Forget The Witcher and Superman: Henry Cavill to lead Warhammer 40K dream project
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warhammer 40K has been one of the most popular properties among gamers and others for almost 40 years.
Cavill posted a brief teaser to Instagram to announce his involvement:For 30 years I have dreamt of seeing a Warhammer universe in live action.
To all of you Warhammer fans out there, I promise to respect this IP that we love.
But Cavill's involvement could help alleviate fans' concerns, given that Cavill is a dedicated Warhammer 40K geek who has often talked about painting figures and other Warhammer-related activities in interviews.
Warhammer 40K is set in the very distant future (the 40K roughly refers to the years when it takes place) that is analogous in some ways to what historians used to refer to as Europe's Dark Ages.

     Henry Cavill to Star in and Executive Produce ‘Warhammer 40,000’ – Rolling Stone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After bidding goodbye to his roles in DC’s Superman and Netflix’s The Witcher, Henry Cavill is out of temporary retirement and is set to star and executive produce an adaptation of the popular tabletop game Warhammer 40,000.
Amazon Prime Video officially acquired the global rights to the IP from Games Workshop (GAW), according to the Hollywood Reporter, which also includes the Warhammer 40,000 rights across film, TV and more.
This marks the first major acquisition of its kind for Amazon Studios.
“I couldn’t be more grateful for all the hard work put in by Vertigo, Amazon and Games Workshop to make this happen.
“In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman’s life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill.
