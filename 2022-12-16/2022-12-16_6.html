     Summary: Eyeing China, Japan lifts longtime restrictions to allow major defense buildupEnlarge this image toggle caption Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty ImagesTOKYO — Japan has made a significant policy change to allow it to get the ability to strike other nations, a move widely seen as a major step toward rearming the nation more than seven decades since it demilitarized after World War II.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, meanwhile, accused Tokyo of "hyping up the 'China threat' to find an excuse for its military buildup."
It's the biggest shift in Japan's defense policy since its cabinet reinterpreted the constitution in 2014 to allow the military to fight in support of an ally under attack.
The government insists that Japan's defense policies will remain strictly defensive, and the country will neither threaten other nations, nor carry out preemptive strikes, in violation of international law.
The security documents name China, its military buildup and tensions with Taiwan, as primary threats.

     EXPLAINER: Why Japan is boosting its arms capability, budget
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here is a look at Japan's new security and defense strategies and how they will change the country's defense posture.
___COUNTERSTRIKE CAPABILITYThe biggest change in the National Security Strategy is possession of “counterstrike capability” that Japan calls “indispensable."
Japan says missile attacks against it have become "a palpable threat" and its current interceptor-reliant missile defense system is insufficient.
Kishida said his government will need an extra 4 trillion yen ($30 billion) annually and proposed tax increases to fund a quarter of it.
Japan will spend 8 trillion yen ($58 billion) over the next five years on cross-domain defense including cybersecurity and space.

     Summary: On Wednesday, the budget committee of the German parliament voted to approve the purchase of nuclear-capable F35 aircraft from the United States.
As in Japan, there is broad popular opposition in Germany to military rearmament as a result of the horrendous crimes of German imperialism in the Second World War.
Now, too, both Germany and Japan are making preparations for wars that risk consequences for their populations as devastating as those of the Second World War.
The United States, Germany, Japan and other imperialist powers are preparing for a new imperialist world war.
Are the governments in Tokyo and Berlin willing to risk a repeat of the horrors of the Second World War?

     As regional threats rise, Japan shifts away from defense-only strategy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With China, North Korea and Russia directly to its west and north, Japan “faces the severest and most complicated national security environment since the end of the war,” the strategy said, referring to World War II.
Under the strategy, Japan’s defense spending through 2027 will increase to about 2% of Japan’s GDP to total some 43 trillion yen ($320 billion), 1.6-times that of the current five-year total.
Japan’s defense buildup has long been considered a sensitive issue at home and in the region, especially for Asian victims of Japanese wartime atrocities.
Rapid advancement of missiles have become “realistic threats” in the region, making interception by existing missile defense systems more difficult, the strategy said.
Last month, Japan and the United States held a major joint military exercise in southern Japan to step up the allies’ readiness.

     ‘A turning point’: What Japan’s defense boost means

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‘A turning point’: What Japan’s defense boost meansPrime Minister Kishida Fumio's Friday announcement that Japan will double its investment in military power is a sign of how a nation can quickly adapt to changing times.
The announcement is a milestone in the yearslong political effort by the prime minister's party to grow Japan’s military muscle.
Former Prime Minister ABE SHINZO got the ball rolling, seeking to field an aircraft carrier, acquire advanced warplanes and boost defense spending.
“But fundamentally, there is a strong consensus that Japan needs to invest more in defense, and that is unlikely to change,” he said.
The Pentagon has already pushed defense firms to begin replenishing artillery and rockets, including Javelin anti-tank missiles used on the battlefield in Ukraine.
