     Summary: Eyeing China, Japan lifts longtime restrictions to allow major defense buildupEnlarge this image toggle caption Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty ImagesTOKYO — Japan has made a significant policy change to allow it to get the ability to strike other nations, a move widely seen as a major step toward rearming the nation more than seven decades since it demilitarized after World War II.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, meanwhile, accused Tokyo of "hyping up the 'China threat' to find an excuse for its military buildup."
It's the biggest shift in Japan's defense policy since its cabinet reinterpreted the constitution in 2014 to allow the military to fight in support of an ally under attack.
The government insists that Japan's defense policies will remain strictly defensive, and the country will neither threaten other nations, nor carry out preemptive strikes, in violation of international law.
The security documents name China, its military buildup and tensions with Taiwan, as primary threats.

     Pacifist Japan to double defense spending, buy counterstrike missiles as China and North Korea fuel anxiety
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The country is sharply boosting defense spending and will gain a preemptive counterstrike capability for the first time since the last world war.
The changes will give Japan options to hit targets in North Korea or China.
Sharing borders with Russia, China and North Korea, Japan faces "the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II," Japan's National Security Strategy now declares, after getting its first update.
Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said the move had heralded "a new era in the defense of democracy."
PM Kishida’s new national security strategy makes a clear, unambiguous strategic statement &amp; puts a capital “D” next to Japan’s deterrence.

     As regional threats rise, Japan shifts away from defense-only strategy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With China, North Korea and Russia directly to its west and north, Japan “faces the severest and most complicated national security environment since the end of the war,” the strategy said, referring to World War II.
Under the strategy, Japan’s defense spending through 2027 will increase to about 2% of Japan’s GDP to total some 43 trillion yen ($320 billion), 1.6-times that of the current five-year total.
Japan’s defense buildup has long been considered a sensitive issue at home and in the region, especially for Asian victims of Japanese wartime atrocities.
Rapid advancement of missiles have become “realistic threats” in the region, making interception by existing missile defense systems more difficult, the strategy said.
Last month, Japan and the United States held a major joint military exercise in southern Japan to step up the allies’ readiness.

     ‘A turning point’: What Japan’s defense boost means
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‘A turning point’: What Japan’s defense boost meansPrime Minister Kishida Fumio's Friday announcement that Japan will double its investment in military power is a sign of how a nation can quickly adapt to changing times.
The announcement is a milestone in the yearslong political effort by the prime minister's party to grow Japan’s military muscle.
Former Prime Minister ABE SHINZO got the ball rolling, seeking to field an aircraft carrier, acquire advanced warplanes and boost defense spending.
“But fundamentally, there is a strong consensus that Japan needs to invest more in defense, and that is unlikely to change,” he said.
The Pentagon has already pushed defense firms to begin replenishing artillery and rockets, including Javelin anti-tank missiles used on the battlefield in Ukraine.
