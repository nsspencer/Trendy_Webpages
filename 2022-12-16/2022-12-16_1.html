     Where is ‘Black Adam’ streaming?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That seems to put a lot of Johnson’s hope to see Black Adam and Superman on the big screen to bed.
If this is true, it’s odd, given that Shazam and Black Adam are direct rivals in the comics.
Black Adam is on the lower end of Rotten Tomatoes critics' ratings with 39%, but seems to be a hit with audiences at 89%.
Where I felt Black Adam falls is the incessant nature of reminding the audience that Johnson’s character is not a hero.
Black Adam is a good character for DC – however, introducing him within Shazam content may have done him better.

     ‘Black Adam’ arrives on HBO Max following box office bust
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Black Adam” is now streaming on HBO Max, giving more fans a chance to watch the DC antihero movie starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.
“Black Adam” premiered in theaters on October 21.
However, Johnson disputed claims that “Black Adam” would lose between $50 million and $100 million.
In a tweet, Johnson cited financiers, saying “Black Adam” would net between $52 million and $72 million.
There’s still hope for “Black Adam” to do well now that it’s streaming on HBO Max for its millions of subscribers.

     Black Adam's HBO Max Release Timing Couldn't Be Worse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Black Adam releases on HBO Max on December 16, 2022, but the timing of its streaming debut now feels anticlimactic.
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYNow Black Adam will release on HBO Max just two months after its theatrical premiere following a global box office haul of less than $400 million.
With Black Adam performing below expectations, however, the chance of a Black Adam sequel is looking slim.
But watching Black Adam for that specific scene now doesn’t have the same attraction – the tease of a Black Adam versus Superman confrontation is now unlikely to lead anywhere.
Black Adam’s HBO Max release now feels underwhelming, a consolation prize marking the slow end of an era.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His death symbolizes the death of the future, of possibility, of a different, more hopeful path for Black Adam.
Legendary writer Christopher Priest has leaned into the dual nature of Black Adam, with Adam’s mortal persona of “Theo” being his Bruce Wayne, while “Black Adam” is his Batman mode.
He’s a doctor-in-training who it also turns out is a long distant descendant of Black Adam.
He’s the young hero by whom Black Adam hopes to cleanse his sins.
Malik is Black Adam’s second (and final) chance, after having fallen to tragedy up until this point.

     Bones and All, Black Adam, and every other movie you can stream from home this weekend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This week Bones and All, the latest romantic horror road movie from Call Me by Your Name director Luca Guadagnino starring Taylor Russell and Timothée Chalamet, is available to stream on VOD.
Black Adam, the latest installment in the soon-to-be-retconned DC cinematic universe starring Dwayne Johnson, finally three-point lands onto HBO Max.
The critically acclaimed psychological horror film Nanny arrives this week on Prime Video, while the Christmas-themed horror movie The Apology starring Anna Gunn (Breaking Bad) premieres on Shudder.
From our review:The best criticism of Black Adam might have been made by Johnson himself, well before the movie came out, in the post-credits sequence for DC League of Super-Pets.
As Black Adam’s canine companion Anubis, Johnson notes that being an antihero is “basically exactly like a regular hero, except way cooler.
