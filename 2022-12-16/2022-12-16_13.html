     Summary: Dino Danelli, drummer with blue-eyed soul pioneers the Rascals in all their incarnations, has died at age 78.

Watch the Young Rascals Perform ‘Good Lovin”Along the way, Danelli came to accept the fact that they'd always be known as a “blue-eyed soul” band.
How do you describe guys that sing like black guys, are influenced by R&amp;B music, and play that way?” Danelli said in 1998.
… So, you put all that stuff on a record and what do you get?”Some assumptions followed, but Danelli just saw it all as good music.

     Summary: Dino Danelli, the drummer who brought a jazzman's virtuosity to the rock 'n' roll sound of The Rascals, passed away Thursday in New York City, according to his Facebook page and confirmed by his bandmates.
"It is with a broken heart that I must tell you of the passing of Dino Danelli," said Rascals guitarist Gene Cornish on social media.
“They were absolutely amazing, and it was one of the most inspiring performances of my life,” said Van Zandt to the Asbury Park Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, in 2013.
On stage with the Rascals, he brought his maniacal jazz chops that helped define the unique rock sound of the band, and his stick twirls helped define the look of the Rascals, too.
Van Zandt did the honors that night.
