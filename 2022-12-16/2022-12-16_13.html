     Seahawks’ Tyler Lockett to have hand surgery, could return in coming weeks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Seahawks wide receiver Tyler Lockett will have surgery to repair and stabilize a fracture in his hand, Seattle head coach Pete Carroll said Friday.
What they’re sayingSeahawks quarterback called Metcalf “a leader on this team, leader on this offense.”“And he’s a guy that we rely on, that I rely on,” quarterback Geno Smith said.
“So, we have guys that are willing to step up.
I look forward to seeing those guys step up in their new roles, but you can never replace a guy like Tyler.
I’m just pulling for him to get back as soon as possible.”Required reading(Photo: Gary A. Vasquez / USA Today)

     Tyler Lockett injury update: Seahawks WR's season in question after broken finger
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During Seattle's final drive, wide receiver Tyler Lockett broke a bone in his index finger, coach Pete Carroll said after the game.
Tyler Lockett injury updateWith only three weeks remaining, there is a legitimate concern that Lockett's finger injury could keep him out for the remainder of the season, though the team is holding out hope.
#Seahawks WR Tyler Lockett is expected to have surgery to repair and stabilize his fractured finger, source said.
Before Thursday's game, Lockett had taken 244 snaps in the slot and 408 snaps out wide.

     Seahawks Entering Uncharted Waters Without Tyler Lockett
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the NFL's most durable receivers, the Seattle Seahawks have never had to worry about playing multiple games without Tyler Lockett.
RENTON, Wash. - Since coming into the league as an unheralded third round pick out of Kansas State in 2015, Tyler Lockett has been a pillar of excellence and reliability for the Seahawks on and off the field.
Maybe [Lockett] can pull off something that would surprise us a little bit here, so we'll see.
Put simply, the Seahawks have never had to worry about playing an extended stretch without Lockett and when he has been out, his absence has been felt.
Already reeling with four losses in the past five games, Carroll knows Seattle can't replace the production of a dynamic playmaker of Lockett's caliber with one player and the timing couldn't be much worse.
