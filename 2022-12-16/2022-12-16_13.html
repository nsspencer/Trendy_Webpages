     Summary: Cameron JourdanUSA TODAY SportsTough start to the week for Charlie Woods, and it had nothing to do with his golf game.
While warming up for Friday's pro-am at the 2022 PNC Championship at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Charlie rolled his ankle and is hurting a bit.
During his round, Charlie had a bit of a limp and looks uncomfortable after hitting some of his shots.
Cameras showing Friday's pro-am round captured Charlie and father Tiger Woods walking away from the 11th green, and they both had a noticeable limp.
Team Woods goes off with Team Thomas, with Justin playing with father Mike, at 12:02 p.m.

     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. – In a bit of a role reversal, it wasn’t Tiger Woods’ health he was immediately asked about following his pro-am round Friday at the PNC Championship.
It was his son’s health that drew reporters’ attention.
Charlie Woods appeared to be favoring his left ankle and was seen limping throughout the round.
Asked after the round about his son’s condition, Tiger said, “He is [fine].
“You've got to be able to do that when [you’re] playing tournament golf.
