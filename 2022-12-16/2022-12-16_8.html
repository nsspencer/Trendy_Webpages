     Does Janet Jackson's Son Eissa Know His Mom Is Famous? She Says...
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch : What Janet Jackson Wears to Feel Most ConfidentTo most of the world Janet Jackson is a superstar but to her son, she is just: momBut not for long, it seems.
The "Rhythm Nation" singer, who is gearing up for her upcoming Together Again tour, recent shared that her son, Eissa Al Mana, 5, is becoming more aware just how famous his mother is.
"I think his friends are starting to put it together for him," Janet told Today on Dec. 16.
"I've kept him away from it all."
And in Spring 2023, when the Together Again tour kicks off, Eissa—whom Janet shares with ex Wissam El Mana—will get a front row seat at what's made his mother a household name.
