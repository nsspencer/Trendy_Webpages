     Netflix’s Dull CIA Series The Recruit is More Like Paperwork
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Noah Centineo (fresh off of a super supporting role in "Black Adam," expanding his on-screen prowess from the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" movies) stars in the series as Owen Hendricks, a new recruit to the CIA.
He's just a lawyer when the series starts, working in an office space that's bleaker than Initech, and learning through one loss after the next about how things are done in Langley.
And because he's so green, Owen is hazed by two new and unamused co-workers, Lester (Colton Dunn) and Violet (Aarti Mann).
As part of his hazing, Owen is given stacks of "graymail," written letters by people who threaten to release government secrets.
She is threatening to release secrets unless she is set free.

     'The Recruit' drafts Noah Centineo as he graduates from teen heartthrob to spy lawyer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Centineo plays Owen Hendricks, a just-starting-out CIA lawyer who somewhat inexplicably gets drawn into a complex international espionage plot that sends him bouncing around the globe and puts him in considerable danger.
Either more senior agents/lawyers had the day off, or the CIA really wants to reach a younger demographic.
Granted, good spies and reliable attorneys can be hard to find, especially when trying to wrap both vocations into one.
But as “The Recruit” inadvertently reminds us, good TV series are too.
“The Recruit” premieres December 16 on Netflix.

     The Recruit: Season 1 Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Recruit premieres globally on Netflix on Dec. 16.
The most original thing going for Netflix’s new spy/thriller, The Recruit, is its passion for gleefully thrashing its lead character, Owen Hendricks (Noah Centineo).
It’s also over-packed with ops upon ops upon ops which exist to put Hendricks in escalating situations of dire personal threat.
If you love spy shows, The Recruit isn’t pulling any punches so it will scratch the thriller itch.
And Centineo’s Hendricks is so unlike most spy leads we see today that it does keep you watching.

Centineo excels at loveable, and while Owen is also charming, he's also more nuanced.

     Noah Centineo’s ‘The Recruit’ Is a Semi-Clever Thriller Without Punch: TV Review

     Summary: Which makes him a fit for a show with a lot of incident but no real center.
“The Recruit,” a new Netflix drama created by Alexi Hawley, thrusts Centineo’s character Owen Hendricks into the midst of international spyjinks, throughout which he runs the emotional gamut from benignly interested to mildly nervous.
There are moments of spark here, as when Owen attempts to coach Max through tricking a polygraph test.
(This viewer learned somewhat startling information about the biological metrics a test like that might use!)
The action, bombastic and violent, begins to run together, used as it is to juice interest somewhat at random.

     Summary: It’s an intriguing premise, and things only get more interesting up to and throughout the show’s cliffhanger-filled ending.
In the season 1 finale of The Recruit, Owen and Max go to Prague together for what is supposed to be a final mission.
Max meets with an unknown group of Russians, and Max and Owen ultimately find themselves in a shootout.
Owen ultimately freaks out over the realization that he killed a man, and ultimately threatens to leave the CIA.
For now, all fans of the first season can do is speculate about what might come next in a potential second season.
