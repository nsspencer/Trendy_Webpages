     The Barbie Trailer Is Full of Fashion Easter Eggs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After months of anticipation, the first trailer for Greta Grewig’s Barbie film hit the internet on Friday, and it’s a technicolored visual treat.
In it, Margot Robbie, who stars as the historic doll, stands as tall as a skyscraper on a sandy landscape amidst young girls playing with baby dolls.
A bit of fashion history: Robbie wears the same shoulderless black-and-white striped bikini as the very first Barbie doll, released in 1959.
Ryan Gosling, who plays Ken, wears a fringe leather vest paired with fingerless leather gloves.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And by “summer camp,” we mean sitting down for the most anticipated (and campiest) 2023 theatrical release next July: Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.
The titular and tentpole Mattel doll has had over 200 careers, but no role on her résumé has ever been “live-action movie star” ... until now.
The official logline for Barbie, which is being co-produced by Mattel Films, Heyday Films, and LuckyChap Entertainment (Robbie’s banner), is: “Barbie lives in Barbie Land and then a story happens.”Oookay.
That doesn’t tell us anything at all about the plot of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie!
But, some rumors, based on Robbie’s own Letterboxd account, have been swirling since this past June when first-look images were released.

     Greta Gerwig’s Barbie movie trailer puts Margot Robbie in the middle of A Space Odyssey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first teaser trailer for the Barbie movie has arrived to change toys, and maybe history, forever.
The teaser also gives us out first look at Margot Robbie as Barbie herself, as well as Ryan Gosling’s Ken.
While there’s still no telling what exactly Barbie is about, this trailer certainly sets a specific and pretty hilarious tone.
The trailer, which is playing in front of the epically sized Avatar: The Way of Water, opens with a 2001: A Space Odyssey parody that includes children destroying their baby dolls after seeing the majesty of a 30-foot tall Margot Robbie Barbie doll — all narrated by Helen Mirren.
Joining Gerwig as a co-writer on the movie is her partner Noah Baumbach (Marriage Story).

     Helen Mirren Confirms That Was Her in the Barbie Trailer—And There’s More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Since the beginning of time, since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls,” Mirren says in the preview, an unexpected homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Barbie lowers her sunglasses and winks once to nearby girls playing with their baby dolls, who immediately drop or violently smash their toys.
Mirren admits that the film “was a bit of a disaster, really,” but her relationship with Gerwig thankfully survived the movie’s memory.
Two years later, she earned a follow-up Oscar nomination for writing 2019’s Little Women, which Gerwig also directed.
In a cover story for Vanity Fair, Robbie spoke about adapting the iconic Mattel product through her production company LuckyChap Entertainment.
