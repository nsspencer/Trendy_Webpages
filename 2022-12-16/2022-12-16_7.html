     Summary: A massive aquarium holding 1,500 tropical fish bursts in BerlinEnlarge this image toggle caption John MacDougall/AFP via Getty Images John MacDougall/AFP via Getty ImagesThe enormous cylindrical aquarium was a wonder, the centerpiece of a popular Berlin hotel.
But in the early hours of Friday morning, it burst — and soon afterward, Berlin Mayor Franziska Giffey said all of the roughly 1,500 fish the aquarium had contained were believed to be dead.
The AquaDom aquarium was touted as the largest freestanding cylindrical aquarium in the world.
People who were staying in the hotel report being awoken by a loud crash or rumbling noise, only to realize that the immense fish tank was suddenly gone.
The large aquarium and hotel are part of the DomAquaree building, a complex that sits near the Berlin Cathedral.

     Huge Berlin aquarium bursts, spilling 1,500 fish onto road
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: watch nowA huge aquarium in Berlin burst early on Friday, spilling 1 million litres (264,172 gallons) of water, around 1,500 exotic fish and debris onto a major road in the busy Mitte district, emergency services said.
"The whole aquarium burst and what's left is total devastation.
A spokesperson for the fire brigade told Reuters it was still unclear what had caused the AquaDom aquarium to burst.
Radisson told its Radisson Rewards loyalty club members in an e-mail that the Radisson Collection Hotel Berlin was closed until further notice.
The company, which had offered glass elevator rides through the AquaDom aquarium, said it would also remain closed until further notice.

     Giant Berlin aquarium bursts, sending 1,500 fish to their deaths
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 1-million-liter aquarium that housed over 1,000 tropical fish burst in a hotel lobby in Berlin on Dec. 16.
Videos posted to social media from guests inside the hotel show significant damage and cascades of water all over — except in the empty tank.
More than 80 types of fish lived inside the aquarium, including blue tang and clownfish popularized by the animated movie “Finding Nemo.”Advertisement“Unfortunately, none of the 1,500 fish could be saved,” Giffey told reporters.
Two hotel guests, Karin Wicki and Sandra Hoffmann, recounted how the Radisson is now unrecognizable after the aquarium burst.
“The fish tank of my hotel just exploded in the middle of the night,” one guest said.
