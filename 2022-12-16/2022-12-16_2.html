     Summary: A massive aquarium holding 1,500 tropical fish bursts in BerlinEnlarge this image toggle caption John MacDougall/AFP via Getty Images John MacDougall/AFP via Getty ImagesThe enormous cylindrical aquarium was a wonder, the centerpiece of a popular Berlin hotel.
But in the early hours of Friday morning, it burst — and soon afterward, Berlin Mayor Franziska Giffey said all of the roughly 1,500 fish the aquarium had contained were believed to be dead.
The AquaDom aquarium was touted as the largest freestanding cylindrical aquarium in the world.
People who were staying in the hotel report being awoken by a loud crash or rumbling noise, only to realize that the immense fish tank was suddenly gone.
The large aquarium and hotel are part of the DomAquaree building, a complex that sits near the Berlin Cathedral.

     Huge Berlin aquarium bursts, spilling 1,500 fish onto road
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: watch nowA huge aquarium in Berlin burst early on Friday, spilling 1 million litres (264,172 gallons) of water, around 1,500 exotic fish and debris onto a major road in the busy Mitte district, emergency services said.
"The whole aquarium burst and what's left is total devastation.
A spokesperson for the fire brigade told Reuters it was still unclear what had caused the AquaDom aquarium to burst.
Radisson told its Radisson Rewards loyalty club members in an e-mail that the Radisson Collection Hotel Berlin was closed until further notice.
The company, which had offered glass elevator rides through the AquaDom aquarium, said it would also remain closed until further notice.

     US company to send team to look into Berlin aquarium rupture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BERLIN — (AP) — A U.S. company that helped build a huge aquarium in Berlin says it is sending a team to investigate the rupture of the tank, which sent a wave of debris, water and tropical fish crashing through the hotel lobby it was located in and onto the street outside.
Berlin's top security official, Iris Spranger, told German news agency dpa on Friday that "first indications point to material fatigue."
About 400 to 500 mostly small fish from a separate set of aquariums housed under the hotel lobby were evacuated to other tanks in a neighboring aquarium that was unaffected.
The AquaDom aquarium opened in December 2003 and was modernized in 2020.
It said that “we are also deeply saddened by the animals and aquatic life lost.”Copyright 2022 The Associated Press.

     Huge Berlin Aquarium Bursts, Unleashing Flood of Devastation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A huge aquarium in Berlin burst, spilling debris, water and hundreds of tropical fish out of the AquaDom tourist attraction in the heart of the German capital early Friday.
They were evacuated to other tanks in the neighboring Sea Life aquarium that were unaffected.
Sea Life Berlin is located in the same building and visitors can tour it and the AquaDom on a single ticket.
Animal rights group PETA tweeted Friday that the aquarium became a “death trap” for the fish housed in it.
The aquarium, which was last modernized in 2020, is a major tourist magnet in Berlin.
