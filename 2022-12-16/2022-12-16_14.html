     NOTEBOOK: QB Zach Wilson named Jets' starter for Sunday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "We kind of had an idea," Campbell said.
"So, we're ready.
He (Wilson) is a competitor like most of players in this league.
He's certainly talented and they will have a good game plan designed for him where he can succeed and get it to their weapons.
They are going to try to take the pressure off him as much as possible and just let him be him and use his talents and skills."

     Jets QB Mike White not cleared to play; Zach Wilson to start vs. Lions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zach Wilson will get a shot at rewriting the narrative after his midseason benching.
New York Jets coach Robert Saleh announced Wilson would start Sunday against the Detroit Lions after Mike White was not cleared for contact due to a rib injury.
White was optimistic he could play this week after taking multiple shots and exiting twice in Sunday's loss in Buffalo, but doctors ultimately wouldn't clear the Gang Green starter.
"This is going to be a great opportunity for Zach," Saleh said.
The Lions have allowed 199.4 receiving yards per game to receivers in 2022, second-most in the NFL, so there should be opportunities for plays if Zach Wilson plays within the offense.

     Zach Wilson to start for Jets as Mike White not cleared for contact

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen A. Smith reacts to Zach Wilson being named the starter after Mike White was not cleared to play.
(1:15)FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- The New York Jets made an unexpected quarterback change Friday, announcing that Mike White is out Sunday and that former starter Zach Wilson is back in the lineup to face the Detroit Lions.
White, who told reporters Friday that he suffered fractures to his ribs, wasn't cleared for contact by team doctors, coach Robert Saleh said.
White went to the locker room for an X-ray and was cleared by team doctors to return.
Saleh had said as recently as Wednesday that the Jets (7-6) were "still working as if he's playing this week," never mentioning that White still had to be cleared for contact.

     QB Zach Wilson Will Start vs. the Lions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: QB Zach Wilson, who was elevated to the Jets' backup spot on Monday, will start Sunday when the Green &amp; White host the Detroit Lions at MetLife Stadium.
There is a chance White could play next Thursday against the Jaguars, but the short week will make it more difficult.
2 overall pick in 2021, started seven games this season before he was moved to the No.
Saleh stressed that Wilson needed a "reset" and also said he intended for the second-year QB to play again this season.
In seven starts, Wilson has completed 55.6% of his throws for 1,279 yards with 4 TDs and 5 INTs.

     Zach Wilson now has chance to validate Jets’ decision on career-defining stage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If this all works out, Wilson returns behind center as a humbled, more mature player than he was three weeks ago.
If this all works out, Wilson will turn out to be the franchise quarterback the Jets believed him to be when they used that precious first-round draft pick on him.
And right now, Wilson is back as the Jets starting quarterback until further notice.
Zach Wilson is once again the Jets’ starting quarterback.
But after having numerous conversations with Wilson’s teammates in the aftermath of his benching, the consensus among them was that this was a 22-year-old kid in the spotlight who made a mistake.

     Jets turn back to QB Zach Wilson with Mike White not medically cleared for contact
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Jets quarterback Zach Wilson will start Sunday against the Detroit Lions, head coach Robert Saleh announced Friday.
Mike White wanted to play and has practiced but was unable to get medically cleared for game contact.
"He's exhausted every measure he possibly can because he wants to be out there for his teammates," Saleh said.
The news comes after Wilson was benched for White prior to the team's Week 12 game against the Chicago Bears.
He's been holding himself accountable with regard to how he wants to attack practice, how he's been performing in practice.
