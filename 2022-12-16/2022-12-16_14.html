     Charlie Woods rolled his ankle warming up for Friday's round at the PNC Championship

     Summary: Cameron JourdanUSA TODAY SportsTough start to the week for Charlie Woods, and it had nothing to do with his golf game.
While warming up for Friday's pro-am at the 2022 PNC Championship at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Charlie rolled his ankle and is hurting a bit.
During his round, Charlie had a bit of a limp and looks uncomfortable after hitting some of his shots.
Cameras showing Friday's pro-am round captured Charlie and father Tiger Woods walking away from the 11th green, and they both had a noticeable limp.
Team Woods goes off with Team Thomas, with Justin playing with father Mike, at 12:02 p.m.
