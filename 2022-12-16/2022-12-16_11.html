The Atlas Lions may have been regarded by many as underdogs but you do not get to a World Cup semifinal with just luck.
“Perhaps Morocco’s performance at this World Cup will be enough to persuade FIFA delegates to finally award the tournament itself to Morocco after several failed bids in the past.
They were only recognised by FIFA in 1992 and yet ended their first-ever World Cup campaign with a third-place finish just six years later.
“This World Cup has been about ‘the last dance’ for so many of Modric’s contemporaries,” he said.

     Summary: December 17, 2022 at 3:10 AM ESTFor 2018 runners-up Croatia, reaching a second consecutive final looked unlikely when they won just one group game.
"Still, we will give everything we've got on Saturday and try to win the bronze medal."
Semi-final defeat represented an opportunity missed to crown a golden generation of players, with coach Zlatko Dalic confirming most of them — headed by Luka Modric — will not play in the next World Cup.
"There is no blame on our guys, I congratulate them for everything they've done at this World Cup.
Now we have to get up, dust ourselves off and try to win the bronze medal.”(Photo: Getty Images)
