     Ohio train derailment prompts water utility across state lines to take precautions as health concerns mount
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The water utility is also going to install a secondary intake on the Guyandotte River in case there is a need to switch to an alternate water source.
The utility noted that there has not been any change in raw water at its Ohio River intake.
So the water system in the actual village of East Palestine is 100% safe," the mayor said.
The move was meant to get rid of highly flammable, toxic chemicals in a controlled environment and created a dark plume of smoke.
A town hall is scheduled for Wednesday at the East Palestine High School’s auditorium to respond to residents' concerns.
