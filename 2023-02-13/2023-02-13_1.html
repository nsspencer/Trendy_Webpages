     Valentine’s Day spending projected to increase 8% from last year as inflation lingers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For many people, Valentine's Day presents an opportunity to express love to that special person in your life, oftentimes through gifts.
Whether your sweetheart prefers flowers, jewelry, or a home-cooked meal, inflation will factor into the cost of just about everything this Valentine's Day.
The dollar amount is up from $175.41 in 2022, and the second-highest figure since NRF began tracking Valentine’s Day spending in 2004.
Similar to recent years, the top shopping destination to purchase Valentine’s Day gifts is online (35%), closely followed by department stores (34%), discount stores (31%) and specialty stores (18%).
The shop will be open from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Valentine's Day.

     Fighting HIV Stigma With Valentine’s Day Cards

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A portion of the pop-up exhibition for LOVE POSITIVE WOMEN at MoMA PS1 (all photos Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic)Since 2015, the arts nonprofit Visual AIDS has celebrated Valentine’s Day with women living with HIV through LOVE POSITIVE WOMEN (LPW), a grassroots initiative that uses the holiday as a backdrop for activism and advocacy through community kinship and artistry.
With the help of Brooklyn-based paper-making mill Dieu Donné, LPW has invited artists, activists, and community members to design hand-crafted Valentine’s Day cards to distribute internationally to women living with HIV.
Since last year, MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, New York has become the location for Visual AIDS’s annual pop-up exhibition.
“Why not do something nice for the women most forgotten about?,” LPW founder Jessica Whitbread asks in a text for the project.

VALENTINE'S DAY QUIZ!
This legend claims St. Valentine sent the jailer’s daughter a final note before his execution, where he signed off as, "Your Valentine."
Over time, the Feast of Saint Valentine became a day when people celebrated love, and eventually, it evolved into what is now known as Valentine’s Day.
Heart motifs and varying shades of red are common design elements on Valentine's Day products.

     Summary: CNN —Valentine’s Day is almost here, and yet there seems to be more stress and viral particles in the air than love.
This Valentine’s Day, take permission to forgo the red hearts pomp and circumstance and do whatever your grumpy heart desires.
The charm and romanticism associated with Valentine's Day appear to have withered some this year.
“There’s no right or wrong way to spend Valentine’s Day,” said Dr. Jennifer Guttman, a New York-based clinical psychologist.
Rather than setting expectations around Valentine’s Day or other big holidays, Luster recommends focusing on acknowledging that all days can contain good and bad, so just make it your day.
