     Sil Caggiano, a hazardous materials specialist, discusses more chemicals found on East Palestine, Ohio train derailment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (WKBN) — Three more chemicals have been found on the Norfolk Southern train that derailed in Ohio just over a week ago, and they are being described as dangerous.
“We basically nuked a town with chemicals so we could get a railroad open,” said Sil Caggiano, a hazardous materials specialist.
The freight train derailment on Feb. 3 in East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania state line left a mangled and charred mass of boxcars and flames as authorities launched a federal investigation and monitored air quality from the various hazardous chemicals in the train.
Caggiano recommends that anyone in the East Palestine area should get a health check-up so there is documentation in the event of any effects possibly related to the train derailment.
About 50 cars, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed in a fiery crash on Feb. 3.
