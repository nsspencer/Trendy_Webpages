     Summary: Rozman said it was too early to know a motive and whether the man had some type of affiliation with the university.
“There’s a lot that we don’t know at this point,” Rozman said.
Two people were killed at Berkey and another was killed at the MSU Union, he said.
Before the gunman was found dead, WDIV-TV meteorologist Kim Adams, whose daughter attends Michigan State, told viewers that students were worn down by the hours-long saga.
“And then I have all these people texting me wondering if I’m OK, which is overwhelming.”Michigan State has about 50,000 students.
