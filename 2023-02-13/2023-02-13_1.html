     Super Bowl Ads: Most-Viewed Spots on YouTube
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrities once again ran up the score for Super Bowl advertisers.
The most-watched Super Bowl LVII ad on YouTube on Sunday was Melissa McCarthy’s Booking.com spot, in which the actor and comedian is whisked away on a whirlwind musical tour of gorgeous vacation getaways.
While many Super Bowl advertisers release their big-game spots days or even weeks ahead of the event itself, YouTube’s analysis of SB ads is designed to measure buzz on gameday.
Meanwhile, Google also released search trends for the game — revealing that “is Rihanna pregnant” was the top Google search in the U.S. during the halftime show.
The most-searched celebrity overall during the Super Bowl was rapper A$AP Rocky, Rihanna’s partner, according to Google.
