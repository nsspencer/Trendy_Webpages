     Jessica Biel is Unnerving as Hell in the First Trailer for Candy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jessica Biel appears once every five years, wielding a knife or some other weapon (say, an axe), just to remind you, I am a serious actress, dammit!
But with the release of the new trailer for Hulu's upcoming true crime series, Candy, I'm sensing a pattern is all I'm saying.
(With source material this wild, perhaps it's not shocking that Candy is the first of two Candy Montgomery TV series coming out this year.
After befriending school teacher Betty Gore (played by Melanie Lynskey), Montgomery allegedly accused Gore of pursuing an affair with her husband.
She confronted the teacher and, as Candy testified, Gore picked up an axe and swung at Montgomery and then Montgomery retaliated.

     Jessica Biel is your friendly neighborhood axe murderer in teaser for Hulu's Candy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She then took on podcasts, adapting the popular Limetown into a limited series, and now she is joining the true crime wave with a new series for Hulu called Candy, in which she plays accused murderer Candy Montgomery.
This story has everything: an affair, a gruesome murder, Texas housewives, the 1980s, a sensational trial, it’s easy to understand why there are TWO television shows about Candy Montgomery coming out this year.
Candy is debuting first, with Biel starring as Montgomery and Melanie Lynskey playing Betty Gore (Timothy Simons and Pablo Schreiber star as their respective husbands).
Later this year, HBO Max will have a limited series called Love and Death in which Elizabeth Olsen stars as Candy Montgomery and Lily Rabe plays Betty Gore.
Candy looks pretty good, especially Biel as Candy Montgomery.
