     Alabama Basketball: Five keys to beating Notre Dame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Check out five keys for an Alabama Basketball win over Notre Dame.
Actually, there would be six keys, but one is so obvious – no Crimson Tide turnover explosion – that no elaboration is required.
The Notre Dame bigs are not leapers and Charles Bediako should cause them trouble near the basket.
Alabama can wear down Notre Dame with its pace, but the effect may not be seen until late in the game.
Alabama’s tempo and depth should prevail, but it is a mistake to think Notre Dame is not a formidable foe.

     In-N-Out: Alabama Basketball's NCAA Tournament Road Ended Early by Notre Dame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN DIEGO — Alabama basketball coach Nate Oats stressed three important things that his Crimson Tide needed to improve on heading into the NCAA Tournament.
It was a slow start for both Alabama and Notre Dame to start the game.
At just under three-and-a-half minutes into the game, Crimson Tide junior guard Jahvon Quinerly injured his left knee while driving to the basket.
Ryan finished the game with a team-leading 29 points for Notre Dame, including seven made 3-pointers out of nine shots.
Meanwhile, Notre Dame will advance to take on 3-seed Texas Tech on Sunday in the Second Round.

     Nate Oats: Maturity, experience were issues for Alabama, but still ‘successful’ season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “It was a successful season by a lot of standards,” Oats said.
“Just the understanding of what it takes to win at this level -- again, they talk about trying to get old, stay old -- we had a lot of young inexperienced guys,” Oats said.
“I thought maybe we handled adversity a little -- not quite as well,” Oats said of the season as a whole.
It’s a neat group that way.”That sort of leadership never sufficiently emerged for Alabama this season, something Oats made clear after multiple losses this season.
“Overall, I’d say we had a successful season just a little disappointed, a little inconsistent, to be honest with you,” Oats said.
