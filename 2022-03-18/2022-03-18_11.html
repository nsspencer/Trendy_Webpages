     Alabama Basketball: Tide and Irish seeds should have been reversed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Crimson Tide fans who watched the Tide flourish early in the season and whither late, the end was not surprising.
The Crimson Tide went 8-11 the rest of the way, stumbling to a 19-win season, with a closing, four-game losing streak.
Against Notre Dame, the Tide played more like the 11-seed rather than the Fighting Irish.
Ryan didn’t need much scoring help from his teammates, but as a team, the Irish shot 53.7% to 40.6% for the Crimson Tide.
Giving that stat some perspective – Alabama took 64 shots to produce 60 points; Notre Dame took 54 shots to produce 68 points.

     Summary: The Alabama basketball team was defeated 78-64 by a Norte Dame team that had to win a play-in game that went two overtimes on Wednesday followed by an all-night, cross-country flight.
Coach Nate Oats started Jaden Shackelford, Jahvon Quinerly, Charles Bediako, Keon Ellis, and Noah Gurley in the Friday afternoon game.
Shackelford and Ellis hit three point shots to give the Tide a 22-21 lead with seven minutes left in the period.
Alabama had 28 rebounds, 16 assists, nine steals, four blocks, and 14 turnovers.
