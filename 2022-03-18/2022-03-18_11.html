     Bad things came in 3s for Blue Hens vs. Villanova, which was part of lesson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I enjoyed every minute of it,” fifth-year senior guard Ryan Allen said after his final Delaware game, despite Villanova’s late dominance and the outcome.
And they should also serve as brick in whatever foundation the Blue Hens build for their future, which looks quite promising.
And with 13 teams in the league next season because of expansion, more schools will have to play an extra tournament game, making finishing higher even more critical.
So while it can never become Villanova, Delaware is certainly on the right track in emulating its approach.
If it’s something Delaware can start doing better, it would hasten the Hens return to the NCAA Tournament.

     2022 NCAA Tournament: Villanova heats up in 80-60 opening round win over Delaware
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After an NCAA Tournament opening day slate highlighted by a few massive upsets and dramatic overtime finishes, Delaware hoped to do the same against Villanova on Friday.
The Blue Hens rumbled with the Wildcats for the first 12 minutes, but then Villanova heated up from long range, before pulling away for a 80-60 NCAA Tournament opening round win.
“It took us some time to adjust to their speed and their intelligence, as we tried to figure out what they were doing,” Villanova coach Jay Wright said.
Once it got going, Villanova never slowed down.
“I think we played great team defense, and it’s just going to prepare us for Sunday,” Villanova guard Collin Gillespie said.

     Summary: 20 (Sun) / 2:40 P.M. vs. Ohio State UniversityPITTSBURGH, Pa. – Over the course of the game's opening minutes, Villanova searched for an offensive flow in its NCAA Tournament First Round matchup Friday at PPG Paints Arena against Delaware.
"Delaware (22-13 overall) built an early 9-4 advantage five minutes into the period as the Wildcats connected on just 2-of-8 from the field to open the contest.
"Another burst – this one a 7-0 surge – gave the Wildcats a 27-23 lead with 3:10 on the first half clock.
Daniels led the way with eight points while Dixon added seven points.
"Samuels was asked by a media member if he had considered simply letting the ball go out of bounds given the large lead the Wildcats had at the time.

     Summary: Villanova overwhelmed the Blue Hens under a barrage of 3-pointers to begin the school's quest for a third national title in seven seasons.
Jyare Davis led Delaware with 17 points but over the course of 40 minutes, Villanova exposed the considerable gulf between schools that are bitter rivals in several sports, just not basketball.
Graduate forward Dylan Painter, who began his career at Villanova, gave Delaware an early 15-8 lead, easing any anxiety that the stage would be too big.
“That’s not what we do here at Villanova,” Samuels said.
Go Blue Hens!"
