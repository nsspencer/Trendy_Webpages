     Panthers failure with Deshaun Watson reveals obvious truth to Buccaneers
    </h2>

     Summary: The NFC South always has the potential to be a very dangerous division.
The Panthers have been the laughing stock of the NFC South for the past few years, especially during the Matt Rhule era.
The Panthers are poorly run and poorly coached, and the entire NFL world can see that in how they handled the Deshaun Watson process.
Thread: The Panthers were in contact with Watson's reps on Thursday, a league sources tells @BookofEllis and I.
The bad news for the Bucs is the Panthers were likely the best team to waste Watson’s talents if he comes to the NFC South.
