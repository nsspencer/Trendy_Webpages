     Duke basketball: Blue Devils need changes to win March Madness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Keels and Banchero will play a huge role in determining how far the Blue Devils go.
But the Blue Devils have to have a better collective presence, first and foremost, and that starts with simple, fixable things.
This may not magically transform into an elite defensive unit, which means the Blue Devils are going to have to find a way to maximize their firepower.
To get into transition, the Blue Devils have to get stops, and it can’t just be those two guys driving it.
Still, assuming all other constants, it’s Banchero who will ultimately have the most say over whether the Blue Devils make the Final Four.

     Summary: Sometime between today and never, Duke Blue Devils men’s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski will lose one more NCAA tournament game.
Despising Duke and Krzyzewski has been the default among healthy sports fans for generations now, but I didn’t always hate them.
I was fond of the first Duke teams I can remember, from watching Atlantic Coast Conference games on black-and-white TV on fuzzy over-the-air feeds.
I felt bad when Duke lost the 1986 national championship game to a seven-loss Louisville team.
