     Instant takeaways: LSU exits NCAA Tournament with loss to Iowa State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LSU’s roller coaster of a season came to a roller coaster of an end on Friday night as the Tigers were eliminated from the NCAA Tournament at the hands of Iowa State in the first round in Milwaukee.
LSU did not get off to a hot start, with Iowa State controlling the first half.
In the first 20 minutes, the Tigers’ offense couldn’t drum up much as it couldn’t finish near the rim or establish any consistent three-point shooting.
LSU found some spark in the second half, but it wasn’t enough as Iowa State was able to hit the clutch shots that the Tigers could not.
With this team’s season now over, here are five takeaways from the loss to the Cyclones.
