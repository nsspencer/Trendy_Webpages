     Champions League quarter-final draw in full: Chelsea drawn against Real Madrid, Man City vs Atletico Madrid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: C helsea will face Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of the Champions League next month.
The two sides were drawn together at this morning’s draw and the Blues also learned that they will face either Atletico Madrid or Manchester City if they make it to the semi-finals.
Chelsea also have a headache over getting to Real Madrid as they are capped at spending £20,000 on travelling to away games.
The ties, however, could be reversed due to the fact Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid cannot play at home on the same day.
A reunion with Chelsea throws up a number of intriguing plot lines for the Blues, with their former manager Carlo Ancelotti now in charge of Real Madrid.

     Summary: Manchester City will face Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter finals as they learned their potential path to the final in Paris.
City beat Sporting in the last-16 thanks to a 5-0 first leg victory in Lisbon followed by a professional 0-0 draw at the Etihad.
Now attention turns to the quarter finals, with big clubs like Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus exiting in the last round.
