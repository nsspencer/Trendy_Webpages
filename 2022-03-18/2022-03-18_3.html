     Report: Deshaun Watson new deal with Browns worth $230 million guaranteed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deshaun Watson is making big money with the Cleveland BrownsDeshaun Watson is not only getting traded to the Cleveland Browns per reports, but his new deal with Cleveland is being reported all all guaranteed, making NFL history.
That obviously didn’t happen for either of those franchises, but with Deshaun Watson joining the Browns the entire AFC North has changed.
This surprise move by the Browns — and Watson — is big news and does change the landscape of the entire AFC.
The best thing is both the Texans and Watson seem to have got what they wanted as the Texans would have not paid Deshaun Watson the type of money he’s receiving.
Now it is time to wait to see what happens next, but for Deshaun Watson he’s made history with his new team before even taking the field.
