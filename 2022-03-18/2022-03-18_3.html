     'Deep Water' is a disjointed take on an unhappy couple's open marriage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lyne's comeback after a 20-year absence is one of the selling points of Deep Water, his new adaptation of a 1957 Patricia Highsmith novel.
And so — like Eyes Wide Shut with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, or By the Sea with Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt — Deep Water offers the titillating spectacle of a real-life ill-fated couple playing a fictional ill-fated couple.
At times, Deep Water seems to move as slowly as those snails.
This movie slyly inverts that setup, partly by making the Van Allens' marriage so unhappy to begin with.
I can't call Deep Water a good movie, exactly, but I can't deny that there's something good about having Adrian Lyne back.

     Deep Water movie review &amp; film summary (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We meet Vic Van Allen (Affleck) and his wife Melinda (Ana de Armas) deep in the misery of a failed partnership.
They have stuck together, seemingly for their daughter Trixie (Grace Jenkins), but there seems to be little love that remains between the couple.
In a moment alone together, Vic tells the new beau that he killed Melinda’s last lover, who's now missing.
There’s a fascinating thematic undercurrent in “Deep Water” about two people who may seem very different but are both users—Melinda uses men for pleasure and to provoke her husband.
Lyne knows exactly how to use their physical beauty and sexual chemistry on-screen, reminding viewers how rarely we see this kind of thing between major movie stars.

Claire Folger/20th Century Studios“Deep Water,” the new movie streaming on Hulu starring onetime couple Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas, is a throwback to a bygone era.
Ana de Armas in “Deep Water.” – 20th Century StudiosThe Bad“Deep Water” is very much a hit-or-miss movie, with entire scenes in which characters act in a manner that defies expectation.
If you can’t cut loose and let the inconsistencies go, however, “Deep Water” will be a certified belly flop.

     Why Did Deep Water End like That?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A lot of fuss has been made over Adrian Lyne’s film adaptation of Deep Water, based on the novel by The Talented Mr. Ripley scribe Patricia Highsmith.
While Deep Water doesn't quite reach those heights—it currently holds a 42% on Rotten Tomatoes—the ending, at least, will certainly leave you scratching your head, even if you're familiar with Highsmith's novel.
At the end of the movie, Vic keeps his pants on while Melinda says, “I saw Tony,” then proceeds to burn Tony's wallet and identification.
Obviously there are “reasons" for why the Deep Water screenplay, written by Zach Helm and Euphoria auteur Sam Levinson, went in a different direction from its source material.
In rare moments, Deep Water felt like a modern, psychosexual take on Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, with its unending focus on a couple that clearly hates each other.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementWhether you find Deep Water deliciously preposterous or just … preposterous may depend on how much you miss that kind of movie.
From Deep Water’s first scene, it’s clear Vic Van Allen (Ben Affleck) and his wife Melinda (Ana de Armas) share a kink so weird it puts bunny-boiling to shame.
The absence of explanatory back story for either of these two sickos is one refreshing element of Deep Water.
Ben Affleck sniffing his snails: that is what you are in for if you commit to watching Deep Water.
AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThe last third or so of Deep Water takes a swerve even farther from verisimilitude than the already not-that-believable storyline that preceded it.

     Explaining the Snails in Patricia Highsmith Movie Deep Water
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Courtesy of 20th Century StudioSpoilers follow for the film Deep Water, streaming on Hulu as of March 18.
In Deep Water, the Patricia Highsmith adaptation from iconic erotic-thriller director Adrian Lyne and screenwriters Zach Helm and Sam Levinson, Ben Affleck’s Vic is a weird guy.
Over and over, Deep Water suggests that these snails are both Vic’s primary passion and a reflection of his oddness.
The film adaptation of Deep Water doesn’t lift all these details, but the ones Helm and Levinson do choose are effectively used to honor Highsmith’s original intent for the character.
In spending time with and even sleeping in the same room as the snails, Vic finds intimacy and tranquility that remind him of what he and Melinda once had.
