     Spanish Clubs, Surprises Meet Their Match After Balanced Champions League Draw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was something of a surprise that three Spanish clubs made it through to the last eight of the Champions League.
Chelsea beat Real Madrid more comfortably in last season’s semifinal than the 3–1 aggregate score may suggest.
But the biggest question, of course, concerns Guardiola and his tendency in big Champions League games suddenly to switch tactics.
Of the other four, one was a scoreless draw in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semifinal before Liverpool went on to win the tie.
The only defeat was 1–0 to Inter having already won the first leg 2–0, which leaves a 2–2 league draw against European champion Chelsea.
