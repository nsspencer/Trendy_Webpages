     3 Perfect teams for the Atlanta Falcons to send Matt Ryan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Atlanta Falcons have found a way to create new off-season drama for themselves after making the highly questionable decision to chase Deshaun Watson.
Atlanta can hardly go crawling back to Ryan after attempting to land Watson.
However, it seems more likely Ryan is going to demand a trade and look to win a ring he won’t have a shot at with the Atlanta Falcons.
Leaving Atlanta wondering where could Ryan land and what could they get in return?
Now it is Ryan deciding what his future will look like, where is the perfect landing spot for Matt?

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So much that the Falcons and Matt Ryan agreed to push the $7.5 million roster bonus back so they can work out a trade.
Atlanta will turn their attention to making Matt Ryan feel wanted while he considers his options.
The value of Matt Ryan in a tradeIndianapolis should not be investing a ton into getting Matt at this point.
Don’t get me wrong here, Matt Ryan could be a really good player with a lot to prove in the AFC.
But he is not the future of the Indianapolis Colts.

     The Colts-Matt Ryan Rumblings Are Starting To Grow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Colts enter the weekend with still no idea who will be their starting quarterback when the 2022 regular season kicks off in September, one name keeps getting mentioned across NFL circles and that name is Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan.
The soon-to-be 37-year old figures to be on the trading block if the Falcons acquire Deshaun Watson from the Houston Texans.
Ryan carries a massive cap hit, one Atlanta will have to eat the majority of, but if it means they acquire Watson I’m sure it will be a pill they’d be happy to swallow.
Falcons now have pushed back the $7.5 million roster bonus due Friday to QB Matt Ryan to Tuesday, giving Atlanta four extra days to hear the Deshaun Watson decision and be able to trade Ryan if necessary, per league sources.
If that happens, expect the Matt Ryan domino to fall quickly as the Falcons don’t want to be on the hook for the additional $7.5 million.

     Matt Ryan trade rumors: Seahawks and Colts best possible landing spots for Falcons QB if he gets dealt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 14 seasons in Atlanta, Matt Ryan could finally be on the move.
If the Falcons want to do what's best for Ryan, then they'll do everything they can to make sure he ends up in Indianapolis.
The Colts feel like a team that's one good quarterback away from being a Super Bowl contender and Ryan definitely qualifies as a good quarterback.
In 2016, Shanahan was the offensive coordinator for the Falcons in a season where Ryan ended up being voted MVP.
If they can let bygones be bygones, the combination of Ryan and Shanahan might be able to rekindle their 2016 magic.

     Matt Ryan’s Contract – Not As Bad As You Think for Colts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As it stands right now, Ryan’s cap hit on the Falcons would be $36.66 million for 2022.
His $28 million cap hit in 2023 would also rank 10th among quarterbacks that season.
The Colts would be able to handle Ryan’s contract without any issues.
Ryan’s $23.75 million cap hit would still leave the Colts with $16.05 million in cap space to use on remaining free agents and draft picks.
Have thought's on what Matt Ryan's potential contract with the Colts looks like?

     What's next for Matt Ryan and Atlanta Falcons after Deshaun Watson picked Cleveland Browns?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- Over the past week, the Atlanta Falcons spent their time trying to replace aging former MVP quarterback Matt Ryan with Deshaun Watson, a quarterback in his prime who is facing 22 civil lawsuits alleging sexual assault and inappropriate conduct during massage sessions.
And now, the Falcons’ pursuit of Watson is over, as he appears to be headed to the Cleveland Browns.
Admit you went after Watson but downplay how hard the push was before committing to Ryan in a meaningful way.
In this scenario, Ryan is back in Atlanta for 2022 and perhaps beyond.
Of course, in this scenario, it’s also possible Atlanta has decided it doesn’t want him to return regardless of whether it wanted Watson.
