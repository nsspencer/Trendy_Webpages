     A 13 Year Old Was Behind The Wheel Of A Truck That Caused A Crash That Killed Nine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A car crash in West Texas has resulted in the death of nine people, including an entire college golf team and a child.
NBC News reports that the accident was the result of a child behind the wheel of a truck that was equipped with the wrong tire.
That spare tire seemed to have failed, causing the truck to swerve in front of the van.
Along with the child that was behind the wheel of the truck, a 38-year-old passenger was also killed.
Investigators say that it looks as if several of the golf team members didn’t have their seatbelts on.

     Texas crash latest tragedy for family of young driver, dad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's the latest tragedy for the family of the father and son, of Seminole, Texas.
After the crash, Agatha Siemens shared family photos on social media, saying her husband was the love of her life and that she missed her son.
It's not unusual for young teens to drive in that region and other more rural parts of the United States.
The NTSB sent an investigative team to the crash site in Texas’ Andrews County, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of the New Mexico state line.
University of the Southwest spokeswoman Maria Duarte declined to comment on the NTSB’s announcement about the young driver, citing the ongoing investigation.

     Summary: He’d drive the two-track roads across his family’s ranch in western South Dakota to repair barbed-wire fences or for other tasks.
“Under no circumstances would I be out on a public road without my learner’s permit,” he said.
“Certainly in rural areas there's a general trend of lower minimum driving ages,” Van Tassel said.
Victor Taylor said it would be illegal for a 13-year-old to drive on public roads.
“This is a worst case scenario, on top of a worst case scenario, on top of a worst case scenario,” Chase said.

     NTSB: 13-year-old was driving truck in deadly Texas crash

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The truck’s left front tire, which was a spare tire, also blew out before impact, said NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg.
Although it was unclear how fast the two vehicles were traveling, “this was clearly a high-speed collision,” Landsberg said.
But the news that a 13-year-old was behind the wheel in the Texas crash put a renewed focus on the practice.
The NTSB sent an investigative team to the crash site in Texas’ Andrews County, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of the New Mexico state line.
Also killed were Henrich Siemens, 38, of Seminole County, Texas, and the unidentified 13-year-old boy who were in the 2007 Dodge 2500 pickup.
