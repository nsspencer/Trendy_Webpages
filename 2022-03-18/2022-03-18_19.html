     ‘Windfall’ Review: Money Talks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you can remain awake until the final moments of “Windfall,” then yes, something exciting actually happens.
But that’s a very long wait in Charlie McDowell’s oppressive Netflix drama, a gabby hostage movie with a single, covetable location and three unappealing characters.
A frozen opening shot of the exterior of a luxury California home forewarns of the tedium to come.
A scruffy thief (played by Jason Segel at his most gormless) is poking languidly around the property, as if trying it on for size.
More, they even encourage him to up his asking price.

     Windfall movie review &amp; film summary (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A man (Jason Segel) who will never be named—and neither will the other two major characters—wanders around a nice vacation home in the desert.
Segel downplays his natural optimistic charisma in "Windfall" in a way that doesn’t completely work.
Plemons brings such a fascinating energy to his character that he really holds the film together.
So much so that when he disappears for a long nighttime conversation between Collins and Segel, the film starts to sag.
Part of the problem is that “Windfall” never achieves the slow burn it needs for the conclusion to be earned.

     Summary: 'Windfall' is a satisfying, well-acted thriller that lives up to its clever premiseEnlarge this image toggle caption Netflix © 2022 Netflix © 2022Windfall is not shy about its aspirations to be a throwback.
They are credited as Nobody (Segel), CEO (Jesse Plemons) and Wife (Lily Collins).
Nobody has broken into CEO and Wife's vacation house, and he's about to get away when they unexpectedly arrive.
But he isn't willing to get caught, either, so he can't let CEO and Wife leave or call the police.
McDowell makes good use of a wide variety of backdrops both luscious and spare, as these three people grow to feel more and more trapped in this luxurious place.

     Windfall review: Netflix’s old-school thriller puts Mark Zuckerberg on trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They weren’t supposed to meet — at the start of the film, the thief is alone in the couple’s empty villa.
Filmed with wide shots and long takes, Windfall feels like a play, even though it doesn’t ditch the pleasures of cinema.
Plemons is a delight as “the CEO,” a man who, for much of the film’s runtime, cannot believe he’s being robbed.
As the thief, Segel is a separate highlight: skittish and gaunt, displaying a bit of a mean streak rarely seen in his acting work.
Hold those lies to account, and the real person underneath starts looking a lot less exceptional than they did before.

     Netflix’s Windfall Is a Perfect Class-Rage Noir
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix’s new movie Windfall opens with a long, lingering shot of a mansion’s poolside patio furniture, straight out of an Architectural Digest spread.
Its rooms are as posh as the grounds, with Spanish tile, pristine plaster walls, and abstract pottery everywhere.
And although this man is a total amateur, he piles crime on top of crime, taking the well-heeled couple hostage.
Despite its gleaming setting, Windfall strikes the tone of a noir, its story suffused with a cynicism as sweeping as the vistas its mansion overlooks.
The burglar’s ineptitude fuels some funny moments, like when he’s demanding more money and asks for $150,000 in cash.

     ‘Windfall’ Review: Jesse Plemons, Lily Collins, and Jason Segel Play Against Type in Basic but Enjoyable Thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Whereas mumblecore films mostly starred lesser-known talents, Windfall, however, stars Jason Segel, Lily Collins, and Jesse Plemons, each taking on characters that feel completely different from the roles they’re used to playing.
Segel is known as Nobody, while Plemons is simply called CEO, and Collins is credited as Wife.

Segel, Plemons, and Collins are solid enough to make this waiting around worthwhile, but just barely.
Like McDowell’s last film, The Discovery, Windfall is an intriguing concept that doesn’t dig too far beyond the original concept.
