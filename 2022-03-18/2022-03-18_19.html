    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Take a look at some of Luke Voit's best home runs as he gets traded from the Yankees to the Padres.
(2:00)Luke Voit had a feeling his time with the Yankees was coming to an end once New York brought back Anthony Rizzo.
"Really excited," said Voit as he left Bradenton, where the Yankees played their exhibition opener against Pittsburgh.
"It's a good thing for my career, kind of a fresh start with a new team,'' Voit said.
New York acquired Rizzo from the Chicago Cubs ahead of the trade deadline, seeking a left-handed-hitting first baseman.

     Yankees trade Luke Voit to San Diego Padres, but they'll miss him more than they know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BRADENTON, Fla. – As currently constructed, there wasn’t any room for Luke Voit on these New York Yankees.
Just before the Yankees’ exhibition opener against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Voit – scheduled to bat cleanup and play first base – was traded to the San Diego Padres.
“Honestly, I was getting chills getting ready to play baseball again,’’ Voit said after the extra-long winter.
With Voit's trade, Cashman might be freer to navigate other trade and free-agent opportunities, especially on the starting pitching front.
Voit had blossomed quickly after his 2018 trade from St. Louis, where he was blocked in the Cardinals' system.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The dismissal of Sanchez, Urshela and Voit in the last week was the most overt act away from who the Yankees have been in recent seasons.
Charles Wenzelberg / New York PostSince the 2021 trade deadline, however, the Yankees have steadily changed the complexion of the positional group.
It was heightened in the last week as Sanchez, Urshela and now Voit went out the door.
That assemblage went far, but kept hitting the same wall.
It went far, but not far enough.

     Yankees Trade Luke Voit To Padres
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Yankees and Padres agreed to a trade sending the slugging first baseman to San Diego in exchange for minor league right-hander Justin Lange, according to announcements from both clubs.
The Padres moved right-hander Michel Baez to the 60-day injured list in order to open a spot on the 40-man roster Voit.
Largely blocked from regular playing time in St. Louis, Voit immediately proved to be a hidden gem unearthed by the Yankees.
Productive as he’s been at the plate throughout his Yankees tenure, Voit is a below-average defender at first base.
Voit now heads to the Padres not only for the 2022 season but perhaps all the way through 2024.

     Summary: “I think he's in a good place; I think he's healthy and knows he can go out and be productive.
Last season, Voit played in only 68 games, hitting the injured list on three separate occasions.
Ironically, it was Rizzo’s return this week that ultimately spelled the end for Voit in New York.
“It's partially my fault; last year, I only played \\[68\\] games,” Voit said.
“I can't wait; it’s 75 every day and I don’t have to do New York in April, now,” Voit said with a smile.
