    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster could become a top target of the Green Bay Packers, after the Pack traded star wide receiver Davante Adams on Thursday.
Things have been quiet with the Steelers’ free agent wide receiver through four days of contact with NFL teams.
The team that Smith-Schuster was most connected to before the start of free agency, the Philadelphia Eagles, has backed off.
This is the second time in as many seasons Smith-Schuster has tested free agency without finding an immediate fit.
Ray-Ray McCloud has reportedly agreed to a contract with the San Francisco 49ers, while Smith-Schuster and James Washington remain on the marker.

     JuJu Smith-Schuster agrees to 1-year contract with Chiefs, leaves Steelers after 5 seasons

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Smith-Schuster is getting a one-year, $10.75 million deal from the Chiefs, who courted him last year in free agency.
Smith-Schuster was unable to set himself up for a big free agency contract because he was limited to five games by a shoulder injury.
The Steelers took Smith-Schuster, an underclassman from USC in the second round of the 2017 draft.
Smith-Schuster becomes the second free agent in as many days to leave the Steelers.
Diontae Johnson, entering his fourth season, and Chase Claypool, heading into the third, are the Steelers’ most experienced receivers.

     Summary: How will the offensive line be formulated?
These sorts of uncertainties are what I will look to address in our Buy or Sell series.
Topic Statement: It’s time for JuJu Smith-Schuster and the Steelers to move on.
One can argue that Chase Claypool is (or at least can be) the number two even if Smith-Schuster is on the roster.
Mitch Trubisky is no savior, but he can move around in the pocket, and the offensive line is in the process of being upgraded.

     JuJu Smith-Schuster tweets out he's leaving the Steelers for the Chiefs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last offseason wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster had a chance to go play for the Kansas City Chiefs Smith-Schuster chose to return to the Pittsburgh Steelers on a one-year contract and Ben Roethlisberger’s final season.
However, with Roethlisberger gone, the Chiefs came knocking again and based on this tweet from Smith-Schuster, he will be playing in Kansas City next season.
For his career, Smith-Schuster has 323 career receptions for 3,855 yards.
Twice in his career, Smith-Schuster has caught at least 97 passes.
The move gives a loaded Chiefs offense one more weapon and makes wide receiver a top offseason priority for the Steelers.
