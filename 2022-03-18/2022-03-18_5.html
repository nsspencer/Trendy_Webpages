    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: #3 seed Purdue got the message from Thursday, it doesn’t matter what seed you’re playing, you gotta bring your best.
After a day of upsets, including the #2 seed Kentucky Wildcats losing to St. Peters, the East Region’s Friday started with a bit more normalcy as Purdue dominated the #14 seed Yale Bulldogs, 78-56.
Early in the first half, Yale was attempting to inbound the ball from their own baseline.
But it was true freshman Caleb Furst’s offensive explosion and spark that helped Purdue pull away mid way through the first half.
The only thing Purdue failed to do in the first half was to get struggling sharp shooter Sasha Stefanovic going.

     Summary: The Boilermakers made easy work of the Yale Bulldogs in their 78-56 victory to advance to the Round of 32.
The Hokies were hoping to use their ACC tournament momentum to advance in the NCAA Tournament, but they ran into a high-scoring Longhorns squad that had five different players in double-figures.
