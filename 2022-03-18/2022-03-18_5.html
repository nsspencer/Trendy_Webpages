     Holi photos: Celebrations around the world mark spring’s advent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Observers around the world on Friday celebrated Holi, the springtime Festival of Colors with Hindu origins, which marks the season’s arrival and good’s triumph over evil.
Holi is named after Holika, the demoness aunt of a king’s disloyal son in one of the festival’s source myths, according to holifestival.org.
In that story, King Hiranyakshyap grows frustrated and jealous enough at his son’s worship of Lord Naarayana that the king asks his sister Holika to sit in a fire with his son, Prahlad, in her lap.
Holika does so and burns to death while Prahlad — who chants the name of Lord Naarayana — emerges unharmed as Naarayana’s reward for his unyielding devotion.
Nowadays, friends, lovers, neighbors and relatives splash each other to express their affection.
