     Wisconsin men’s basketball: UW survives Colgate, moves on to round of 32
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UW took control of the game late and escaped a first round scare from the Patriot League champs, winning this one 67-60.
Although the offense struggled, the defense stepped up as they’ve done all year, holding Colgate scoreless for minutes at a time.
Following the Badgers’ run, Colgate went on an 11-4 run of their own to regain control.
Colgate’s shooting display in the first nine minutes of the second half was unlike anything I’ve ever seen.
In a game that was largely a back and forth affair, this was the stretch that won the Badgers the game.

Can Johnny Davis Cook?
It’s impossible to ignore the elephant in the room: Johnny Davis is not healthy.
When the Badger bench isn’t supplementing the starters’ production, especially with Johnny Davis not at 100% they struggle.
