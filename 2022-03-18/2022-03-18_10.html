    </h2>

     Summary: Joey Hauser had a night and MSU showed some resolve lateGREENVILLE, S.C. – That’ll forever be remembered as the Joey Hauser game.
Instead, MSU had just enough for a 74-73 win — with Hauser’s 27 points, on 9-for-12 shooting, and eight rebounds.
He knew how to find the openings on the perimeter and understood that, unlike most Big Ten teams, Davidson didn’t have an answer for him defensively in the post.
MSU didn’t have a lot of good answers for Davidson’s big men, either.
The game didn’t change much — Brooks entered with MSU trailing 27-26 after a Davidson free throw.

     Summary: GREENSVILLE, S.C. — Every time Michigan State basketball needed a basket, Joey Hauser seemed to hit it.
MSU committed just seven turnovers, but one of those came with 37.7 seconds left and the Wildcats applying full-court pressure.
After Hauser hit two more free throws, Brajkovic drained a 3-pointer, and Davidson called timeout with 37.7 left down four.
Then Loyer nearly turned the ball over on the ensuing drive, forcing Davidson to burn its final timeout with 17.6 seconds left.
He also drilled a 3-pointer with 4.6 seconds left, but the Spartans squelched the Wildcats’ hopes after that.
