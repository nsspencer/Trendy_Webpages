     Villanova wears out Delaware and takes NCAA first-rounder, 80-60
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 15 Delaware, 80-60, advancing to face Ohio State Sunday in the second round after the Buckeyes shut off Loyola.
The first players to get to it were from Villanova, setting up an acrobatic layup by Villanova big man Eric Dixon.
The Blue Hens finish their season with a Colonial Athletic Association title and a 22-13 record, while Villanova improved to 27-7.
After the Blue Hens committed just four first-half turnovers, fatigue had to be impacting Delaware’s decision-making.
A late first-half cold stretchThat stretch came at a tough time for the Blue Hens, making one of their last ten shots in the first half.

     Delaware looks to upset Villanova in a Mid-Atlantic NCAA Tournament showdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: pic.twitter.com/4vPC9WmHHn — Nick Lorensen (@nlorensensports) March 9, 2022They got their s*** together and won three straight en route to the Blue Hens’ first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2014.
The Blue Hens have more than just shooters though as Andrew Carr showed that in both the semifinals and finals of the CAA Tournament.
Carr is one of a couple of Blue Hens with Philly ties, which includes Ingelsby, who grew up a Wildcat fan.
PredictionJay Wright is a machine in the first round of the NCAA Tournament and has won his last seven matchups.
I think they roll through the Blue Hens, winning yet another first-round game, this time by a score of 80-56.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After an NCAA Tournament opening day slate highlighted by a few massive upsets and dramatic overtime finishes, Delaware hoped to do the same against Villanova on Friday.
The Blue Hens rumbled with the Wildcats for the first 12 minutes, but then Villanova heated up from long range, before pulling away for a 80-60 NCAA Tournament opening round win.
“It took us some time to adjust to their speed and their intelligence, as we tried to figure out what they were doing,” Villanova coach Jay Wright said.
Once it got going, Villanova never slowed down.
“I think we played great team defense, and it’s just going to prepare us for Sunday,” Villanova guard Collin Gillespie said.

     Summary: 20 (Sun) / TBD vs. Ohio State UniversityPITTSBURGH, Pa. – Over the course of the game's opening minutes, Villanova searched for an offensive flow in its NCAA Tournament First Round matchup Friday at PPG Paints Arena against Delaware.
"Delaware (22-13 overall) built an early 9-4 advantage five minutes into the period as the Wildcats connected on just 2-of-8 from the field to open the contest.
"Another burst – this one a 7-0 surge – gave the Wildcats a 27-23 lead with 3:10 on the first half clock.
Daniels led the way with eight points while Dixon added seven points.
"Samuels was asked by a media member if he had considered simply letting the ball go out of bounds given the large lead the Wildcats had at the time.
