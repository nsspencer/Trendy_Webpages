     Family of driver, 13, in Texas crash 'lost everything' in fire last year, pastor says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The family of the 13-year-old who was driving a pickup truck in a Texas crash that killed nine, including New Mexico college golfers, “lost everything” in a fire late last year, according to a local pastor.
Mennonite Evangelical Church Seminole Pastor Jake Fehr told NBC News on Friday that Siemens was the father of the boy.
Fehr knew Siemens growing up, and the father and son’s funerals will be held at Mennonite Evangelical Church Seminole, even though they attended South Seminole Baptist Church.
Fehr said the Siemens’ house burned down late last year.
“The whole house burned down, they lost everything in that home,” he said, adding that the 13-year-old had siblings.

     Summary: He’d drive the two-track roads across his family’s ranch in western South Dakota to repair barbed-wire fences or for other tasks.
“Under no circumstances would I be out on a public road without my learner’s permit,” he said.
“Certainly in rural areas there's a general trend of lower minimum driving ages,” Van Tassel said.
Victor Taylor said it would be illegal for a 13-year-old to drive on public roads.
“This is a worst case scenario, on top of a worst case scenario, on top of a worst case scenario,” Chase said.

University of the Southwest spokeswoman Maria Duarte declined to comment on the NTSB’s announcement about the young driver, citing the ongoing investigation.
