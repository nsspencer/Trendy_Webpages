     Summary: 11 seed Virginia Tech Hokies in Milwaukee on Friday, the first win in the Big Dance since 2014.
“This will be a confidence builder as the tournament goes on, because I think we just beat one of the best teams in the tournament,” Beard said.
“They were taking away easy catches on the top of the key,” said Virginia Tech guard Hunter Cattoor, who only hit one three after scoring 31 points against Duke in the ACC Tournament title game.
When the Hokies were pressing late in the game, the Horns struggled with some turnovers, but finished with only nine for the game, leading to only 11 points for Virginia Tech.
Against an average offensive rebounding team, Texas limited Virginia Tech to four offensive rebounds and five second-chance points.
