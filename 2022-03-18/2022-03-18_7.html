     Phillies look to go all in with free agent Nick Castellanos – but Marlins remain in the mix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yet their biggest roadblock to a deal with Castellanos may come from an unlikely division foe – the Miami Marlins.
If so, that would put the Phillies well over the newly-established $230 million luxury tax ceiling.
Wednesday, they signed Schwarber to a four-year, $79 million deal that added his big left handed bat to a lineup centered on reigning MVP Bryce Harper.
The Marlins made their largest free agent outlay in owner Bruce Sherman’s tenure in guaranteeing outfielder Avisail Garcia $53 million.
Sherman said earlier this week he anticipated more additions and Castellanos would give the Marlins a South Florida native to build around.

     Nick Castellanos Rumors: Phillies 'In Serious Pursuit' of Outfielder in Free Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dylan Buell/Getty ImagesHaving already made one big splash in free agency, the Philadelphia Phillies might not be done adding to their roster.
Per The Athletic's Jayson Stark, the Phillies are in "serious pursuit" of Nick Castellanos.
The Phillies agreed to a deal with Kyle Schwarber on Tuesday, per Jim Salisbury of NBC Sports Philadelphia.
The plan is for Schwarber to play left field, but Stark noted he could end up at designated hitter if Castellanos signs with the Phillies.

     Phillies making push for Castellanos (sources)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phils and Kyle Schwarber agreed to terms on Wednesday on a four-year, $79 million contract, and one source said afterward that the Phillies were finished with their heavy lifting.
Well, Castellanos’ deal could exceed $100 million, if it is a long-term deal.
Even if it is a short-term contract, it would push Philadelphia well past the Competitive Balance Tax threshold for the first time in franchise history, although managing partner John Middleton has said multiple times over the years that ownership will exceed the threshold for the right player.
The Phillies would also need to surrender a second-round pick in the 2022 MLB Draft, too, because the Reds made Castellanos a qualifying offer.

Credit to @jaysonst for reporting on the Phillies' "serious pursuit" of Castellanos earlier this morning.
So I wouldn’t be surprised if they were serious about Castellanos (especially after reports of their recent connection to Jorge Soler and Luke Voit).

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This morning it was reported by Jayson Stark of The Athletic that the Philadelphia Phillies were going after free agent outfielder Nick Castellanos.
To say that adding Nick Castellanos back would be a difference maker would be an understatement.
The Cincinnati Reds outfield, no matter how you slice it, is a bit of a mess right now.
Nick Castellanos could be that guy as we’ve all seen over the years – including last season when he hit .309/362/.576 with 34 home runs and 100 RBI for Cincinnati.
He’s not going to come cheap, but hey – The Reds have been shedding payroll over the last week and have plenty of money to spend if they choose to do it.

     Summary: Nick Castellanos hit .309 with 34 home runs and 100 RBIs with the Reds last season.
Read moreCLEARWATER, Fla. — A few days after reaching an agreement with Kyle Schwarber, the Phillies are considering a free-agent slugger double-down with Nick Castellanos.
Indications from a major league source Friday morning were that the Phillies are in talks to sign Castellanos, which would confirm an MLB Network report from one day earlier.
The Phillies’ luxury-tax payroll stands at roughly $220 million, $10 million below the 2022 threshold under the new collective bargaining agreement.
Upon reporting to spring training this week, the reigning NL MVP expressed his hope that the Phillies would sign a top slugger and lobbied specifically for Schwarber, Castellanos, and Kris Bryant.

The Phillies are “in serious pursuit” of signing the free-agent slugger, according to a Friday report by The Athletic‘s Jayson Stark.
This followed a report from MLB Network‘s Jon Morosi on Thursday signaling the Phillies’ interest, even after signing Kyle Schwarber.
As Stark noted, inking Castellanos would take the Phillies over the luxury tax threshold for the first time in franchise history.
But according to Stark, the Phillies seem to believe Castellanos provides enough value to warrant additional spending.

     Phillies In “Serious” Pursuit Of Nick Castellanos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jim Salisbury of NBC Sports Philadelphia tweets that the Phillies are indeed “on” Castellanos.
9:45am: One day after agreeing to a four-year deal with Kyle Schwarber, the Phillies are in “serious” pursuit of fellow slugger Nick Castellanos, reports Jayson Stark of The Athletic.
MLB.com’s Jon Morosi tweeted last night that the Phils still had some interest in Castellanos even after adding Schwarber.
The Reds made Castellanos a qualifying offer, which he naturally rejected, meaning he’d cost the Phillies their second-highest pick and $500K from their international bonus pool.
Bringing Castellanos into the mix won’t fix that longstanding organizational flaw, but it’d nevertheless transform an already deepened Phillies lineup into one of the more formidable units in the entire National League.
