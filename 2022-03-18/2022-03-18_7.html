     Sasha Stefanovic breaks out of shooting slump vs. Yale. That's a good sign for Purdue.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The trey forced a Yale timeout, and Stefanovic did not hide his emotion after putting an exclamation point on an 11-0 run.
The Crown Point sharpshooter celebrated during the break as if he finally exorcised a week-long 3-of-20 shooting slump.
"Obviously I've been in a little bit of a slump lately with my shooting, but yeah, I'm going to continue to shoot.
Having Stefanovic play with confidence will be key if Purdue wants to make a deep tournament run.
On the following possession, Trevion Williams grabbed an offense rebound and kicked out to an open Stefanovic.

     NCAA 2022 East Region: #3 Purdue 78 vs #14 Yale 56- Ivey League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: #3 seed Purdue got the message from Thursday, it doesn’t matter what seed you’re playing, you gotta bring your best.
After a day of upsets, including the #2 seed Kentucky Wildcats losing to St. Peters, the East Region’s Friday started with a bit more normalcy as Purdue dominated the #14 seed Yale Bulldogs, 78-56.
Early in the first half, Yale was attempting to inbound the ball from their own baseline.
But it was true freshman Caleb Furst’s offensive explosion and spark that helped Purdue pull away mid way through the first half.
The only thing Purdue failed to do in the first half was to get struggling sharp shooter Sasha Stefanovic going.

     Summary: It is still a critically important victory, should it come, because the program has been building to this moment, right now, for months, if not years.
Since the moment North Texas finished its upset of Purdue in last year’s NCAA Tournament we have been waiting for right now.
Purdue is the higher seed, but that PTSD (Purdue Tournament Stress Disorder) kicked in the moment I saw their name appear as a potential second round opponent.
There was always going to be at least one moment of, “I don’t know if we can do this,” for Purdue.
There are 120 minutes to go before the Final Four though, and we reach the first moment of true doubt.
