     Luke Voit’s Yankees tenure comes to a close with trade to Padres
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Yankees aren’t done making moves just yet.
After re-signing Anthony Rizzo, the Yankees traded Luke Voit to the Padres for pitching prospect Justin Lange on Friday, the team announced.
That clears the way for Rizzo to play first base without any questions about whether Voit or Giancarlo Stanton should DH.
Luke Voit was made expendable with the Yankees’ signing of Anthony Rizzo this week.
Voit slashed .239/.328/.437 over 68 games for the Yankees and could DH for the Padres — who have Eric Hosmer at first base — with the National League now allowing the designated hitter.

     REPORT: Yankees Trade 1B Luke Voit to the Padres (UPDATE)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With three new additions (Josh Donaldson, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, and Anthony Rizzo) to an infield that already featured Luke Voit, Gleyber Torres, and D.J.
LeMahieu, you knew it was just a matter of time before the Yankees traded away one of their position players.
And with Rizzo in the fold at first, Luke Voit was the obvious choice.
Breaking: Luke Voit traded to Padres — Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) March 18, 2022The big asterisk, however, is that Voit isn’t going to be particularly expensive this season ($5.4M projected via arbitration), which means the Padres shouldn’t need to shed salary quite as immediately.
Someone is going to be traded and the Cubs have been tied up in these rumors since the last trade deadline.

     Yankees trade Luke Voit to San Diego Padres, but they'll miss him more than they know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BRADENTON, Fla. – As currently constructed, there wasn’t any room for Luke Voit on these New York Yankees.
Just before the Yankees’ exhibition opener against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Voit – scheduled to bat cleanup and play first base – was traded to the San Diego Padres.
“Honestly, I was getting chills getting ready to play baseball again,’’ Voit said after the extra-long winter.
With Voit's trade, Cashman might be freer to navigate other trade and free-agent opportunities, especially on the starting pitching front.
Voit had blossomed quickly after his 2018 trade from St. Louis, where he was blocked in the Cardinals' system.

He arrived at Yankees camp notably lighter and is a full year removed from knee surgery.
