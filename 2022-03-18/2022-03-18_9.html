     Summary: 1 seed Kansas will look to punch its ticket to the Sweet 16 on Saturday with a game against No.
Creighton, on the other hand, trailed for most of the game but battled back from a double-digit deficit to force overtime against San Diego State.
KU will be looking to make the Sweet 16 for the eighth time in nine tries as a No.
Of course, the two programs previously faced off last season in Allen Fieldhouse, a game KU won 73-72.
