Jyare Davis led Delaware with 17 points but over the course of 40 minutes, Villanova exposed the considerable gulf between schools that are bitter rivals in several sports, just not basketball.
Graduate forward Dylan Painter, who began his career at Villanova, gave Delaware an early 15-8 lead, easing any anxiety that the stage would be too big.
Villanova's momentum carried over to the second half.
“That’s not what we do here at Villanova,” Samuels said.

It will take a near perfect performance for the Blue Hens to hang around in this one.

Moreover, we’re getting a Delaware team that can post-up efficiently and cut off of those sets.

     Summary: After an NCAA Tournament opening day slate highlighted by a few massive upsets and dramatic overtime finishes, Delaware hoped to do the same against Villanova on Friday.
The Blue Hens rumbled with the Wildcats for the first 12 minutes, but then Villanova heated up from long range, before pulling away for a 80-60 NCAA Tournament opening round win.
“It took us some time to adjust to their speed and their intelligence, as we tried to figure out what they were doing,” Villanova coach Jay Wright said.
Once it got going, Villanova never slowed down.
“I think we played great team defense, and it’s just going to prepare us for Sunday,” Villanova guard Collin Gillespie said.
