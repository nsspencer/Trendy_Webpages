    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now that Watson is heading to Cleveland, what should Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan do?
Or maybe he squeezed the Falcons for a commitment to let him move on, whatever Watson did.
It‚Äôs unclear where he‚Äôd go, but there are teams that are currently doing a lot worse at quarterback than Matt Ryan.
Whatever the case, Ryan was about to find out the hard way that football is a cold, calculating, ruthless business.
And the Falcons were trying very hard to be done with Matt Ryan.

     3 Perfect teams for the Atlanta Falcons to send Matt Ryan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Atlanta Falcons have found a way to create new off-season drama for themselves after making the highly questionable decision to chase Deshaun Watson.
Atlanta can hardly go crawling back to Ryan after attempting to land Watson.
However, it seems more likely Ryan is going to demand a trade and look to win a ring he won‚Äôt have a shot at with the Atlanta Falcons.
Leaving Atlanta wondering where could Ryan land and what could they get in return?
Now it is Ryan deciding what his future will look like, where is the perfect landing spot for Matt?

     Potential trade destinations for Matt Ryan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While at some point fans will say goodbye to Matt Ryan, right now one of the (many) questions is where will Ryan end up?
Adam Schefter reported that the Falcons and Ryan agreed to push the effective date of a $7.5 million guarantee back four days to ‚Äúvet his trade options.‚ÄùWhether Ryan holds a no-trade clause or if the Falcons are doing right by its veteran quarterback, Ryan will apparently have input on his eventual destination.
The market for a veteran quarterback was obviously hotter just a few weeks back, however, there are still a handful of realistic landing spots.
If Ryan is looking for a team ready to compete in 2022, then the Steelers would be a great landing spot.
For Ryan, the Colts would be the most talented team he has played on in five or more years.

     The Colts-Matt Ryan Rumblings Are Starting To Grow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Colts enter the weekend with still no idea who will be their starting quarterback when the 2022 regular season kicks off in September, one name keeps getting mentioned across NFL circles and that name is Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan.
The soon-to-be 37-year old figures to be on the trading block if the Falcons acquire Deshaun Watson from the Houston Texans.
Ryan carries a massive cap hit, one Atlanta will have to eat the majority of, but if it means they acquire Watson I‚Äôm sure it will be a pill they‚Äôd be happy to swallow.
Falcons now have pushed back the $7.5 million roster bonus due Friday to QB Matt Ryan to Tuesday, giving Atlanta four extra days to hear the Deshaun Watson decision and be able to trade Ryan if necessary, per league sources.
If that happens, expect the Matt Ryan domino to fall quickly as the Falcons don‚Äôt want to be on the hook for the additional $7.5 million.

     Summary: Everyone is waiting on Deshaun Watson to choose his trade destination and with that going on, veteran quarterback Matt Ryan has emerged as a potential option for the Indianapolis Colts.
Should the Falcons be the ones to land Watson in a trade, Atlanta would be looking to move on from Ryan.

If he sides with Atlanta ‚Äî his hometown team ‚Äî Matt Ryan will be looking for a new team.

     Matt Ryan trade rumors: Seahawks and Colts best possible landing spots for Falcons QB if he gets dealt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 14 seasons in Atlanta, Matt Ryan could finally be on the move.
If the Falcons want to do what's best for Ryan, then they'll do everything they can to make sure he ends up in Indianapolis.
The Colts feel like a team that's one good quarterback away from being a Super Bowl contender and Ryan definitely qualifies as a good quarterback.
In 2016, Shanahan was the offensive coordinator for the Falcons in a season where Ryan ended up being voted MVP.
If they can let bygones be bygones, the combination of Ryan and Shanahan might be able to rekindle their 2016 magic.

     Matt Ryan‚Äôs Contract ‚Äì Not As Bad As You Think for Colts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As it stands right now, Ryan‚Äôs cap hit on the Falcons would be $36.66 million for 2022.
His $28 million cap hit in 2023 would also rank 10th among quarterbacks that season.
The Colts would be able to handle Ryan‚Äôs contract without any issues.
Ryan‚Äôs $23.75 million cap hit would still leave the Colts with $16.05 million in cap space to use on remaining free agents and draft picks.
Have thought's on what Matt Ryan's potential contract with the Colts looks like?
