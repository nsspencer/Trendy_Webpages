     Kansas City Chiefs, JuJu Smith-Schuster reach one-year deal, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeremy Fowler explains JuJu Smith-Schuster's decision to leave the Steelers and sign a one-year deal with the Chiefs.
(0:42)The Kansas City Chiefs and former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster have agreed to a one-year, $10.75 million deal, a source told ESPN's Field Yates and Jeremy Fowler on Friday.
2 wide receiver Sammy Watkins in free agency last year, struggled uncharacteristically at times on offense, lacking a consistent receiving threat other than Kelce and Hill.
The Chiefs lost last season's third-leading wide receiver, Byron Pringle, as a free agent to the Chicago Bears.
Smith-Schuster, 25, opted to return to the Steelers last season on a one-year deal after hitting free agency, turning down more lucrative offers.
