“I mean, Duke is a very, very talented, athletic group,” Fullerton’s Damari Milstead said when asked to give advice to Duke’s second-round opponent coming Sunday.
“If there’s some way in the future they could change that,” Krzyzewski said in this last of his 36 NCAA tournaments.
“Then that damn floor was slippery, I mean, on both ends,” Krzyzewski said, soon joking, “I know it wasn’t the shoe.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Keels and Banchero will play a huge role in determining how far the Blue Devils go.
But the Blue Devils have to have a better collective presence, first and foremost, and that starts with simple, fixable things.
This may not magically transform into an elite defensive unit, which means the Blue Devils are going to have to find a way to maximize their firepower.
To get into transition, the Blue Devils have to get stops, and it can’t just be those two guys driving it.
Still, assuming all other constants, it’s Banchero who will ultimately have the most say over whether the Blue Devils make the Final Four.
