    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Alabama basketball team was defeated 78-64 by a Norte Dame team that had to win a play-in game that went two overtimes on Wednesday followed by an all-night, cross-country flight.
Coach Nate Oats started Jaden Shackelford, Jahvon Quinerly, Charles Bediako, Keon Ellis, and Noah Gurley in the Friday afternoon game.
Shackelford and Ellis hit three point shots to give the Tide a 22-21 lead with seven minutes left in the period.
Alabama had 28 rebounds, 16 assists, nine steals, four blocks, and 14 turnovers.
The transfer portal needs to be worked hard for some hard nose basketball players that play the game the right way.
