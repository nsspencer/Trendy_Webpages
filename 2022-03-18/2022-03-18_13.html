     NHL rumors: Claude Giroux nixed potential Bruins trade before deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia Flyers captain Claude Giroux is perhaps the best player rumored to be available with Monday's 3 p.m.
Anthony SanFilippo of Crossing Broad reported Thursday night that the Flyers were looking over offers for Giroux from the Colorado Avalanche, Florida Panthers, New York Rangers and Boston Bruins.
It is believed that Giroux nixed offers to New York and Boston.
The last time a high-profile player said no to the Bruins before the trade deadline came in 2013.
With Giroux seemingly off the table for the Bruins, they could turn their attention to one of the top defensemen available.

     Flyers captain Claude Giroux reportedly nixes trade to Bruins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA, PA - JANUARY 25: Claude Giroux #28 of the Philadelphia Flyers looks on against the Boston Bruins during the first period at Wells Fargo Center on January 25, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
(Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images)The Bruins will not win the Claude Giroux sweepstakes.
The Flyers were considering offers from four teams - Florida, Colorado, Boston and the New York Rangers.
It is believed that Giroux nixed offers to New York and Boston.
Passing on the Bruins (and Rangers), but being open to teams like the Panthers and Avalanche would only confirm that.

     Flyers expected to trade Claude Giroux to Panthers amid Ottawa trip
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia Flyers captain Claude Giroux is more than likely headed to the Florida Panthers.
Rumors and reports of the trade are becoming more frequent, and his emotional 1,000th game did everything but sign the deal.
A deal is not yet final, but I'm told it's going to be with the Florida Panthers.
— Anthony SanFilippo (@AntSanPhilly) March 18, 2022Although the deal has not been finalized, all signs point to Giroux joining the Panthers.
Expect the blockbuster trade between the Panthers and the Flyers to take place anytime before the 2022 NHL trade deadline on Monday, March 21.

     Flyers' Claude Giroux plays 1,000th game, doesn't travel on road trip as trade rumors swirl: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia Flyers forward Claude Giroux played in his 1,000th game in Thursday's 5-4 win over the Nashville Predators.
Giroux became the second Flyers player, along with franchise icon Bobby Clarke, to reach the mark with the team.
Later on Thursday night, Giroux did not travel to Ottawa with the Flyers for Friday's game against the Senators amid trade rumors.
He won't play Friday or in Sunday's home game against the New York Islanders ahead of the NHL's trade deadline on Monday, sources tell The Athletic.
Before Thursday's home game, Giroux was honored with a ceremony by the Flyers.

     Summary: AdvertisementClaude Giroux passed that mark last night in Philly, and it will likely be his last game with the Flyers.
But it wasn’t quite enough, as the Hawks’ best was better than the Flyers’ best above Giroux.
Giroux was there for other contending teams, some teams were simply awful, and all the other kinds in between.
Giroux is yet another Flyers linchpin who couldn’t quite get there.
The Flyers couldn’t surround him with enough.

     Claude Giroux trade rumors: Four potential destinations for the Flyers captain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If there is one name to watch for at the trade deadline, it's Claude Giroux.
MORE: 2022 NHL trade deadline: Biggest expiring contracts that could be movedPotential trade destinations for Claude GirouxColorado AvalancheNo team has been mentioned more often in connection to Giroux than the Avalanche.
Philadelphia's brass was at a recent AHL game between the Lehigh Valley Phantoms and Charlotte Checkers to scout the young Panthers forward.
Giroux played under Capitals coach Peter Laviolette during his time in Philadelphia, so like with Berube in St. Louis, there is familiarity there with a possible reunion in D.C. between the two.
Perhaps Flyers backup Martin Jones could be included in the deal with Giroux, killing two birds with one stone for the Caps.
