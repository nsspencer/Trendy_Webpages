    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) — Duke began retiring Hall of Famer Mike Krzyzewski's final NCAA Tournament with minimal stress, beating Cal State Fullerton 78-61 on Friday night.
Freshman Paolo Banchero scored 17 points to lead the Blue Devils (29-6), who jumped to a double-digit lead in the first 4 1/2 minutes and remained in control throughout.
The Blue Devils haven't looked quite the same of late, potentially weighed down by the enormity of playing through a legend's final games in a 47-year career.
BIG PICTURECal State Fullerton: The Titans won the Big West Tournament to earn their fourth bid to the NCAAs and first since 2018 under Dedrique Taylor.
Duke: Moore had said the team used days leading up to the tournament to work on recovering its defensive edge.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Keels and Banchero will play a huge role in determining how far the Blue Devils go.
But the Blue Devils have to have a better collective presence, first and foremost, and that starts with simple, fixable things.
This may not magically transform into an elite defensive unit, which means the Blue Devils are going to have to find a way to maximize their firepower.
To get into transition, the Blue Devils have to get stops, and it can’t just be those two guys driving it.
Still, assuming all other constants, it’s Banchero who will ultimately have the most say over whether the Blue Devils make the Final Four.

But the Blue Devils gave the Titans a bit of hope.
After Fullerton had hit just 3 of its first 17 shots, the Blue Devils turned the ball over on three consecutive possessions.
A Roach 3-pointer from the left corner with 6:25 to play pushed Duke’s lead to 31-17, it’s largest of the first half.
Most of them were live-ball turnovers as Fullerton recorded five steals, which helped the Titans cut into Duke’s lead.
