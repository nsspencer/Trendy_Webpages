     Ohio State basketball uses stifling defense to beat Loyola Chicago
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY SportsAfter everyone counted out the Ohio State basketball team, they used stifling defense to advance to the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
We have talked at length about how bad the Ohio State basketball team’s perimeter defense has been down the stretch.
He was big in the second half after struggling a bit early.
Ohio State will now play the winner of Villanova-Delaware.
Ohio State has a favorable matchup against them too.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a very up and down season (mostly down to end the year), the Ohio State basketball team starts what it hopes will be a run in the NCAA Tournament on Friday.
It’s not the best of matchups you’d hope for trying to break the seal on all the March madness, but it’s the hand that Ohio State has been dealt largely because of a shuffling of the deck that was its own doing.
We’re still waiting to see how healthy and rested this team is, how the game plan unfolds, and what Buckeye squad will show up.
No matter how you look at it though, it’s the NCAA Tournament, so we know you’ll be watching.
We’ve got everything you need to know to find the game and root for OSU to make a little noise and create a little mayhem.

     Ohio State men’s basketball vs Loyola-Chicago: Game preview and prediction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the fourth-straight season and every season under current head coach Chris Holtmann (not including the 2020 season when the tournament was canceled due to COVID-19), the Ohio State Buckeyes (19-11) are dancing.
10 seed Loyola-Chicago Ramblers (25-7) and the legend of Sister Jean in Pittsburgh in the first game on Friday for their first-round matchup.
The Ramblers won the Missouri Valley Conference championship to clinch their spot in the big dance.
Loyola-Chicago is one of the more efficient teams on both ends of the ball, and they can beat you down physically.
As mentioned, the Ramblers are not big and their tallest starter is 6-foot-7, so Kyle Young and Zed Key will play a huge role.

     Basketball Preview: Ohio State Puts Season On the Line Against Loyola in First Round of NCAA Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 7 seed Ohio State and No.
Beyond being the team’s third-leading scorer and rebounder, he gives Ohio State a level of toughness and physicality it doesn't have otherwise.
Young’s intangibles have made him a fan favorite for Ohio State, and without him last season, the Buckeyes were upset in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament.
But if Young and Key can both go, which still seems like a big if, Ohio State should beat a Loyola team that lacks size and has only beaten one NCAA Tournament team all season (San Francisco).
Prediction: Ohio State 76, Loyola 71
