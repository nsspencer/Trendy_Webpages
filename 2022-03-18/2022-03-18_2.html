     Nancy Pelosi reads Bono poem comparing Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to St. Patrick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Simultaneously celebrating St. Patricks Day and addressing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Nancy Pelosi read a new poem written by Bono on Thursday at the annual Friends of Ireland luncheon.
“Bono has been a very Irish part of our lives,” the Speaker of the House said before launching into the poem, which contains the line, “Ireland’s sorrow and pain / Is now the Ukraine / And Saint Patrick’s name now Zelenskyy.”The U2 frontman’s poem compared the legend of St. Patrick, who drove all the snakes of Ireland into the sea, to the war in Ukraine.
In Bono’s metaphor, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is St. Patrick, and Russian President Vladimir Putin represents the snakes.
The poem reads in part, “Oh St. Patrick, he drove out the snakes / With his prayers, but that’s not all it takes / For the snake symbolizes / An evil that rises / And hides in your heart / As it breaks / And the evil has risen my friends.”President Joe Biden, among others on Capitol Hill, were in attendance.

     Bono’s poem about Ukraine read by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at St. Patrick’s Day luncheon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the White House’s annual Friends of Ireland luncheon – celebrated each year to commemorate St. Patrick’s Day (March 17) – US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivered a poem by U2 frontman Bono.
Bono noted in a tweet that he typically sends Pelosi a humorous limerick to read at the luncheon, however opted to offer an “irregular” one that was “not funny at all” for this year’s event.
The speech elicited laughs nonetheless, as Pelosi read aloud the singer and multi-instrumentalist’s rumination on the current war between Russia and Ukraine.

     Summary: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was roasted on social media after she recited what many users said was a "cringe" poem written by U2's Bono.
Pelosi read the poem during the Friends of Ireland luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday as an apparent tribute to Ukraine's fight against Russian invaders.
“Oh St. Patrick, he drove out the snakes with his prayers, but that’s not all it takes,” Pelosi began.
Billy Gribbin, communications director for Rep. Yvette Herrell (R-N.M.), wrote, "This is a Saint Patrick’s day hate crime."
Liam Stack, reporter for the New York Times, responded, "Nancy Pelosi introducing this poem: 'Bono has been a very Irish part of our lives.'

Ireland's sorrow and pain is now the Ukraine, and St. Patrick's name now Zelenskyy."
The invasion, ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, has drawn condemnation around the world and severe economic sanctions against Russia.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for peace talks — so far unsuccessful — while urging his country to fight back.
Putin, 69, insists Ukraine has historic ties to Russia and he is acting in the best security interests of his country.

The 61-year-old rock superstar's poem was unveiled by Pelosi at the White House’s annual 'Friends of Ireland' luncheon yesterday.
Another online wit quipped: 'BREAKING Reports that Russian troops are surrendering en masse after being read a translation of Bono's poem.'
One joked Bono had written a poem that read: 'The war is so sad/ It's making me mad/ But I hope that Vlad/ Gets killed really bad.'
'Isn’t it enough that the eejit BONO goes and hobnobs with the oligarchs at DAVOS every year without getting the eejit Nancy Pelosi to foist his s****y poem on us?'
