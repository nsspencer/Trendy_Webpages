    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a very up and down season (mostly down to end the year), the Ohio State basketball team starts what it hopes will be a run in the NCAA Tournament on Friday.
It’s not the best of matchups you’d hope for trying to break the seal on all the March madness, but it’s the hand that Ohio State has been dealt largely because of a shuffling of the deck that was its own doing.
We’re still waiting to see how healthy and rested this team is, how the game plan unfolds, and what Buckeye squad will show up.
No matter how you look at it though, it’s the NCAA Tournament, so we know you’ll be watching.
We’ve got everything you need to know to find the game and root for OSU to make a little noise and create a little mayhem.
