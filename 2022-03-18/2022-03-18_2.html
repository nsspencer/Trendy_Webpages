     Deep Water Ending Explained and Differences From the Book
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Horrendously dysfunctional married couple Vic and Melina have an arrangement.
Instead it would appear that the couple stays together essentially because he is very rich and she is very pretty.
We understand Malcolm is one of his wife’s former lovers, and Vic tells Joel, his wife’s latest squeeze, that he killed Malcolm with a hammer.
Though we don’t actually find out who killed Malcolm in the film, certainly in the book Vic isn’t Malcolm’s murderer, though the film diverges on other plot points.
Deep Water appears to have a bizarrely boring opener for an erotic thriller.

     Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas bring unhappily married heat to 'Deep Water'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Seeing exes Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas on screen together will be an undeniable attraction (if not of the "Fatal" variety) for "Deep Water," but that shouldn't obscure the simple pleasures of this erotic thriller directed by Adrian Lyne, a crafty veteran of that genre.
While the movie falls apart toward the end, the mystery -- and crackling central performances -- cruises along at a low boil much of the way.
As for Vic, he acts unperturbed by his wife's infidelity, but there's the little matter of Melinda's one-time "friend" who has gone missing, and lingering suspicions as to whether he had anything to do with that.
Vic doesn't seek to quell those rumblings, underscoring the mind games that the couple plays not only with each other, but those around them.
When a pulp writer (Tracy Letts) who is new to the community observes that Vic's "a weird guy," Vic merely smiles at his wife having said much the same to him and responds, "So I've been told."

     'Deep Water' is a disjointed take on an unhappy couple's open marriage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lyne's comeback after a 20-year absence is one of the selling points of Deep Water, his new adaptation of a 1957 Patricia Highsmith novel.
And so — like Eyes Wide Shut with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, or By the Sea with Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt — Deep Water offers the titillating spectacle of a real-life ill-fated couple playing a fictional ill-fated couple.
At times, Deep Water seems to move as slowly as those snails.
This movie slyly inverts that setup, partly by making the Van Allens' marriage so unhappy to begin with.
I can't call Deep Water a good movie, exactly, but I can't deny that there's something good about having Adrian Lyne back.

     ‘Deep Water’ Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lyne’s Deep Water is a real throwback.
Because, Vic tells Joel, Vic killed him.
Deep Water’s biggest flaw is that, for an erotic thriller, emphasis on the thriller, it’s all kind of obvious.
The lighting, for starters, has a very basic quality to it; there’s little play with smoke or shadows, everything’s too bright.
They were literally steamy films; Deep Water just feels kind of flat, overlit.

     The long journey of ‘Deep Water,’ the movie Ben Affleck might like to forget
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (“We should be hip-deep in the promotion cycle for this film, but it is CRICKETS out here,” LaineyGossip wrote last week.)
“But when I saw her work with Ben, I could see straightaway that the chemistry was good.
A few months later, Affleck was photographed spending time with Lopez, and social media lost its collective mind.
In the background of all of this, “Deep Water” got delayed, and delayed, and delayed again; its original theatrical release — Nov. 13, 2020 — kept getting postponed as the pandemic dragged on.
Many critics concede “Deep Water” is watchable, but some were disappointed by the movie’s lackluster tone.

     Explaining the Snails in Patricia Highsmith Movie Deep Water
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Courtesy of 20th Century StudioSpoilers follow for the film Deep Water, streaming on Hulu as of March 18.
In Deep Water, the Patricia Highsmith adaptation from iconic erotic-thriller director Adrian Lyne and screenwriters Zach Helm and Sam Levinson, Ben Affleck’s Vic is a weird guy.
Over and over, Deep Water suggests that these snails are both Vic’s primary passion and a reflection of his oddness.
The film adaptation of Deep Water doesn’t lift all these details, but the ones Helm and Levinson do choose are effectively used to honor Highsmith’s original intent for the character.
In spending time with and even sleeping in the same room as the snails, Vic finds intimacy and tranquility that remind him of what he and Melinda once had.
