     NCAA Tournament Midwest Regional— No. 6 LSU vs. No. 11 Iowa State: How To Watch, Preview, and Gamethread
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Up first for LSU is a trip to Milwaukee where they’ll play Iowa State in the Midwestern Region’s 6-11 game.
Heck Iowa State had a more impressive showing in non-conference play beating three Tournament teams: Iowa, Creighton, and Memphis.
Poseur alluded to it yesterday but it’s eerie how similar LSU and Iowa State are statistically.
LSU shoots 44 percent from the floor, Iowa State shoots 43.9 percent; both teams barely cracked 30 percent shooting from three (32.1 for Iowa State, 31.9. for LSU).
Guard play is paramount in the tournament and Iowa State’s got a pretty good one in Izaiah Brockington.
