He is not part of the Browns’ trade package but is expected to be moved to another team.

     Panthers failure with Deshaun Watson reveals obvious truth to Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NFC South always has the potential to be a very dangerous division.
The Panthers have been the laughing stock of the NFC South for the past few years, especially during the Matt Rhule era.
The Panthers are poorly run and poorly coached, and the entire NFL world can see that in how they handled the Deshaun Watson process.
Thread: The Panthers were in contact with Watson's reps on Thursday, a league sources tells @BookofEllis and I.
The bad news for the Bucs is the Panthers were likely the best team to waste Watson’s talents if he comes to the NFC South.

     Report: Deshaun Watson new deal with Browns worth $230 million guaranteed
    </h2>

     Summary: Deshaun Watson is making big money with the Cleveland BrownsDeshaun Watson is not only getting traded to the Cleveland Browns per reports, but his new deal with Cleveland is being reported all all guaranteed, making NFL history.
That obviously didn’t happen for either of those franchises, but with Deshaun Watson joining the Browns the entire AFC North has changed.
This surprise move by the Browns — and Watson — is big news and does change the landscape of the entire AFC.
The best thing is both the Texans and Watson seem to have got what they wanted as the Texans would have not paid Deshaun Watson the type of money he’s receiving.
Now it is time to wait to see what happens next, but for Deshaun Watson he’s made history with his new team before even taking the field.
