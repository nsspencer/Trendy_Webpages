    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a very up and down season (mostly down to end the year), the Ohio State basketball team starts what it hopes will be a run in the NCAA Tournament on Friday.
It’s not the best of matchups you’d hope for trying to break the seal on all the March madness, but it’s the hand that Ohio State has been dealt largely because of a shuffling of the deck that was its own doing.
We’re still waiting to see how healthy and rested this team is, how the game plan unfolds, and what Buckeye squad will show up.
No matter how you look at it though, it’s the NCAA Tournament, so we know you’ll be watching.
We’ve got everything you need to know to find the game and root for OSU to make a little noise and create a little mayhem.

     Ohio State men’s basketball vs Loyola-Chicago: Game preview and prediction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the fourth-straight season and every season under current head coach Chris Holtmann (not including the 2020 season when the tournament was canceled due to COVID-19), the Ohio State Buckeyes (19-11) are dancing.
10 seed Loyola-Chicago Ramblers (25-7) and the legend of Sister Jean in Pittsburgh in the first game on Friday for their first-round matchup.
The Ramblers won the Missouri Valley Conference championship to clinch their spot in the big dance.
Loyola-Chicago is one of the more efficient teams on both ends of the ball, and they can beat you down physically.
As mentioned, the Ramblers are not big and their tallest starter is 6-foot-7, so Kyle Young and Zed Key will play a huge role.
