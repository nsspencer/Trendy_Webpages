     Ohio State men’s basketball vs Loyola-Chicago: Game preview and prediction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the fourth-straight season and every season under current head coach Chris Holtmann (not including the 2020 season when the tournament was canceled due to COVID-19), the Ohio State Buckeyes (19-11) are dancing.
10 seed Loyola-Chicago Ramblers (25-7) and the legend of Sister Jean in Pittsburgh in the first game on Friday for their first-round matchup.
The Ramblers won the Missouri Valley Conference championship to clinch their spot in the big dance.
Loyola-Chicago is one of the more efficient teams on both ends of the ball, and they can beat you down physically.
As mentioned, the Ramblers are not big and their tallest starter is 6-foot-7, so Kyle Young and Zed Key will play a huge role.

     Basketball Preview: Ohio State Puts Season On the Line Against Loyola in First Round of NCAA Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 7 seed Ohio State and No.
Beyond being the team’s third-leading scorer and rebounder, he gives Ohio State a level of toughness and physicality it doesn't have otherwise.
Young’s intangibles have made him a fan favorite for Ohio State, and without him last season, the Buckeyes were upset in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament.
But if Young and Key can both go, which still seems like a big if, Ohio State should beat a Loyola team that lacks size and has only beaten one NCAA Tournament team all season (San Francisco).
Prediction: Ohio State 76, Loyola 71
