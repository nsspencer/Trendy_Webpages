     Here’s What Happened To WeWork Co-Founder Miguel McKelvey After The Company’s Downfall
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But there was a third party involved in the creation of the real estate co-working start-up: co-founder Miguel McKelvey, who was the design expert of the operation.
The two founded WeWork together in 2010, with McKelvey serving as the chief culture officer in addition to directing construction, architecture, and web design.
As the company grew, Neumann gravitated toward the spotlight while McKelvey worked behind the scenes.
“As Miguel focused on more culture things, Adam focused on, frankly, the things that were driving headlines,” a former executive who asked to remain anonymous told Forbes.
Employees alleged that he frequently hotboxed WeWork’s company jet, showed up to meetings high or hungover, and made generally bizarre statements about expanding WeWork to other planets.

     Summary: Looking out over his legion of WeWork employees in the third episode of AppleTV+’s WeCrashed, founder and CEO Adam Neumann (played by Jared Leto) leads his team in a call and response chant: We!
With a valuation of $47 billion in January of 2019, Adam Neumann set out to take the company public.
In September of 2019, after the company decided to delay its IPO, the board of WeWork forced Neumann to step down as CEO.

     Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway’s ‘WeCrashed,’ about WeWork’s fall, is as essential as a WeWork in a pandemic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “WeCrashed,” the new eight-part miniseries starring Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway as the pair of narcissists who oversaw the breathtaking rise of WeWork and practically engineered its fall, never really figures out how to answer that question satisfyingly.
“WeCrashed” never lets us — or failed actress Rebekah — forget she is a cousin of Gwyneth’s.
As previewed in the pilot, Adam will become in just a few years the company’s most toxic asset.
“WeCrashed” is the umpteenth series to stretch out to four or eight or 12 hours what movies used to do in two.
Much of that sense of inconsequentiality stems from the minimal stakes of WeWork’s decline.

     ‘WeCrashed’ review: Leto and Hathaway wear insufferable well in WeWork drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four minutes into Apple TV+'s WeCrashed, it's clear that Adam Neumann (Jared Leto) and his wife Rebekah (Anne Hathaway) are living in their own world.
If you're already familiar with the damning details of WeWork's rise and fall and are hungry for fresh company revelations, WeCrashed might not be worth the watch.
But if you're looking to be entertained — to watch Leto and Hathaway wholly channel the startups' misguided maverick and muse — then WeCrashed delivers.
Throughout the series, Hathaway brilliantly captures Rebekah's gnawing insecurities and a desperate desire to achieve something of her own.
But Leto and Hathaway wear insufferable well in WeCrashed, and though Adam and Rebekah's cringy behavior and antics grow tiresome, the performances remain amusing throughout.
