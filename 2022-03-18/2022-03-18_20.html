     Lakers vs. Raptors: Lineups, injury reports and broadcast info for Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers play the Toronto Raptors on Friday, and if you’re wondering how you can watch the action live, you’ve come to the right place.
One of those games was against the Raptors at Crypto.com Arena in Southern California, during which they got off to a farcical 21-2 start and never allowed the Lakers to make it a competitive contest.
The Lakers are 2-9 since the All-Star break and have won just eight games since Jan. 7.
Toronto is 18-9 since they were 21-21 in mid-January and is streaking towards a potential playoff spot.
The team is currently in seventh place in the Eastern Conference but is tied with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who are in the sixth spot.

     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers and Toronto Raptors square off once again after meeting Monday this week, but this contest will take place north of the border.
The Raptors won the previous contest 114-103 and will look to keep a five-game winning streak going.
Toronto is a 9-point favorite per DraftKings Sportsbook, with the total set at 224.5Lakers vs. Raptors, 7:30 p.m.
The Raptors should still win this game with their recent form, but look for the Lakers to cover this spread.
Over/Under: Over 224.5These teams just went under this total but as mentioned above, the Lakers shot uncharacteristically poorly from the floor the entire game.

     Lakers Vs. Raptors Game Preview &amp; TV Info: Talen Horton-Tucker, Carmelo Anthony &amp; Wayne Ellington Out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just a few days ago, the Toronto Raptors added to the Los Angeles Lakers’ woes by dominating them at the Crypto.com Arena one night after the Lakers were embarrassed by the Phoenix Suns.
In order to do so, the Lakers are going to have to figure out a way to stop this trend of awful starts.
To put it simply, the Lakers are out of the game before it really begins.
Unfortunately, the Lakers will be short-handed as Talen Horton-Tucker has been ruled out with an ankle issue while Carmelo Anthony and Wayne Ellington are out due to non-COVID illnesses.
The Lakers will also have to do a better job limiting the Raptors frontcourt duo of Pascal Siakam and Scottie Barnes.

     Summary: All night long the Lakers (30-40) took it to the host Toronto Raptors.
With a gutsy full team effort on display, the Lake Show came away with the 128-123 overtime win, ending the 11-game road losing streak.
LeBron and Russell Westbrook would each miss a three-point attempt and it looked as though the Lakers were on their way to a 12th consecutive road loss.
In the extra frame, the Lakers would get some effective shooting in crunch time from Avery Bradley (14 points, three rebounds).
The Lakers will be back in action in our nation’s capital tomorrow night, when they take on the Washington Wizards.
