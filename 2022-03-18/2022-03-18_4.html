     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY SportsAfter beating Loyola Chicago in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the Ohio State basketball team knows who their next opponent will be.
It wasn’t pretty, but the Ohio State basketball team was able to get their first win of this NCAA Tournament.
As far as 2-seeds go, it could be worse for Ohio State.
He just coached his best Tournament game as a Buckeye coach today.
The Ohio State basketball team is looking for some stronger offense to go along with that stellar defense though.

     Summary: After a very up and down season (mostly down to end the year), the Ohio State basketball team starts what it hopes will be a run in the NCAA Tournament on Friday.
It’s not the best of matchups you’d hope for when trying to break the seal on all the March madness, but it’s the hand that Ohio State has been dealt largely because of a shuffling of the deck that was its own doing.
We’re still waiting to see how healthy and rested this team is, how the game plan unfolds, and what Buckeye squad will show up.
No matter how you look at it though, it’s the NCAA Tournament, so we know you’ll be watching.
We’ve got everything you need to know to find the game and root for OSU to make a little noise and create a little mayhem.

     Summary: PITTSBURGH -- — No extended March stay for Loyola Chicago and Sister Jean this time.
Not with Ohio State taking away every inch of open space.
Loyola's 41 points were a season low and the program's fewest since scoring 39 against Indiana State in 2020.
Ohio State came in having lost four of five games, including a baffling setback to lowly Penn State in the Big Ten tournament last week.
A year ago, Ohio State came in as a two seed only to get ambushed by 15th-seeded Oral Roberts in the opening round.
