Known as "The Professor," Clayton was a much-respected and beloved figure in the NFL media world who passed away after a brief illness, the Seahawks announced.
"He was kind to everyone and from the minute I started covering the NFL, he made me feel welcome and offered tips on who to get to know," NFL Media's Judy Battista said.
Loved hitting every training camp while the rest of us were on fumes ‚Äî he did two camps per day a lot.
But mostly I am thinking about his devotion to his wife Pat, and how he cared for her during her own health issues.
