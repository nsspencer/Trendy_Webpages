     Flyers captain Claude Giroux reportedly nixes trade to Bruins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA, PA - JANUARY 25: Claude Giroux #28 of the Philadelphia Flyers looks on against the Boston Bruins during the first period at Wells Fargo Center on January 25, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
(Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images)The Bruins will not win the Claude Giroux sweepstakes.
The Flyers were considering offers from four teams - Florida, Colorado, Boston and the New York Rangers.
It is believed that Giroux nixed offers to New York and Boston.
Passing on the Bruins (and Rangers), but being open to teams like the Panthers and Avalanche would only confirm that.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementClaude Giroux passed that mark last night in Philly, and it will likely be his last game with the Flyers.
But it wasn’t quite enough, as the Hawks’ best was better than the Flyers’ best above Giroux.
Giroux was there for other contending teams, some teams were simply awful, and all the other kinds in between.
Giroux is yet another Flyers linchpin who couldn’t quite get there.
The Flyers couldn’t surround him with enough.

Thursday night made for one more, as the team celebrated their captain's 1,000th NHL game.
By Monday, Claude Giroux will no longer be a Philadelphia Flyer.
"During the game I was trying to keep it together," the 34-year old said of the emotions that hit Thursday night.
"It's tough because we're season ticket holders, so we come to every game, well almost every game, and not to see G anymore...it's tough, he's our favorite player."

     Claude Giroux to be scratched for Flyers' last two games before trade deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia Flyers captain Claude Giroux will not be in the lineup for the team's final two games before Monday's NHL trade deadline, Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman reports.
Giroux was feted by the Flyers faithful Thursday night, when he skated in his 1,000th — and likely final game — with the team.
The Flyers play at Ottawa Friday night and host the New York Islanders Sunday afternoon.
The night began with the team presenting Giroux with a silver stick, a Rolex from his teammates and a crystal from the NHL ahead of his 1,000th game.
After Joel Farabee scored the game-winner, the Flyers players mobbed Giroux in celebration and he took a solo lap around the rink to a standing ovation from the crowd.

     Flyers' Claude Giroux plays 1,000th game, doesn't travel on road trip as trade rumors swirl: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia Flyers forward Claude Giroux played in his 1,000th game in Thursday's 5-4 win over the Nashville Predators.
Giroux became the second Flyers player, along with franchise icon Bobby Clarke, to reach the mark with the team.
Later on Thursday night, Giroux did not travel to Ottawa with the Flyers for Friday's game against the Senators amid trade rumors.
He won't play Friday or in Sunday's home game against the New York Islanders ahead of the NHL's trade deadline on Monday, sources tell The Athletic.
Before Thursday's home game, Giroux was honored with a ceremony by the Flyers.
