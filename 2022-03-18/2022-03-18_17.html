     Hulu's Life &amp; Beth Premiere: Grade the Amy Schumer Comedy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With a tongue-in-cheek title like Life &amp; Beth, it’s no surprise that Amy Schumer’s new Hulu comedy has a melancholy feel between its punchlines.
Despite that, Beth is being considered for a promotion to East Coast Sales Manager, which comes with a $100,000 salary, no health insurance (!)
Then mom lays into Beth, questioning her life choices and her job.
(Beth says she’s not, but when she returns home, it arrives.)
Talking to her sister (For the People‘s Susannah Flood), Beth shares her suspicions that their mom is dating another married guy.

     Jonathan Groff appears on Amy Schumer's new series, 'Life &amp; Beth,' streaming on Hulu starting today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jonathan Groff, the Broadway, film and TV actor who's also a Lancaster County native, appears in the new Hulu series "Life &amp; Beth," starring actor, comedian — and soon to be Academy Awards co-host — Amy Schumer.
All 10 episodes of the show are set to premiere on the streaming service today, March 18.
But on her way to that possible relationship, Beth dates a self-centered trainer played by Groff.
Despite having a limited role in the show — he's in episode 4 of the series, titled "Pancakes" — Groff's work on "Life &amp; Beth" is getting noticed by the critics.
It was recently announced that Groff has been cast in a new M. Night Shyamalan film called "Knock at the Cabin."

     Life and Beth is Amy Schumer at her most endearing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amy Schumer is unquestionably a pioneer of female comedy.
Hulu’s Life and Beth, a mumblecore-esque show, is perhaps Schumer at both her most self-aware, and most endearing — a worthy comeback just ahead of her Oscar-hosting gig later this month.
For how formative Inside Amy Schumer was, its title was almost a prophecy.
She and Amy are similar in tone, but the character isn’t just a vehicle for Schumer’s problematic feminism and vanity.
Regardless, Life and Beth shows that Amy Schumer isn’t letting that narrative define her — and the more intentional she is in that journey, the better.

     'Life &amp; Beth' star Amy Schumer on 'therapeutic benefits' of writing about childhood trauma
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amy Schumer has performed standup in front of sold-out crowds, produced her own sketch show, directed comedy specials and starred in films.
The result is Hulu's comedy "Life &amp; Beth" (now streaming all 10 episodes), which Schumer stars in, writes, executive produces and sometimes directs.
Beth is Schumer's middle name, and like Schumer, the character has a younger sister and divorced parents.
A big event in the series premiere acts as the catalyst for Beth to reexamine her life.
There is no mention of John having autism in "Life &amp; Beth," but Schumer says "he's most likely on the spectrum."

     Amy Schumer’s ‘Life &amp; Beth’ Shifts the Comedian Into a More Passive, Introspective Gear: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Life &amp; Beth,” Amy Schumer’s new show for Hulu, unfolds in three distinct acts.
It takes too long for “Life &amp; Beth” to nudge its lead into the next phase of her life that actually drives the show.
These more affecting moments of “Life &amp; Beth” come in no small part thanks to the actors embodying them, especially Young, Cera, and Savannah Flood as Beth’s straightforward younger sister, Ann.
His forthright, abbreviated way of talking immediately clashes with the winding, self-deprecating style Schumer’s Beth adopts, but in a way that somehow complements it.
“Life &amp; Beth” premieres Friday, March 18 on Hulu.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But first, on March 18, she’ll unveil Life &amp; Beth, a Hulu dramedy that she created, stars in, and helped write and direct.
Fast approaching 40, Schumer’s Beth has managed to create a pretty nice life for herself.
Schumer tells these stories through extensive flashbacks, drawing parallels between young Beth’s (Violet Young) humiliations and grownup Beth’s suppressed emotions.
Amy Schumer, left, and Violet Young in 'Life &amp; Beth' Marcus Price/HuluLife &amp; Beth isn’t a catastrophe.
Life &amp; Beth’s tone lurches from realistic to absurd and back; relatively normal characters suddenly devolve into off-the-wall caricatures.

     Amy Schumer’s Life &amp; Beth Feels Like a Prestige-Comedy Hallmark Movie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is part of what’s so fascinating about Life &amp; Beth, the new Hulu series created by and starring Amy Schumer.
In Life &amp; Beth, Schumer’s life is not Beth’s life, but there are obvious parallels, most especially in Cera’s character, John.
There are two different conceptions of what makes a woman’s story worth taking seriously at play in Life &amp; Beth.
At times, Life &amp; Beth does not manage to fully integrate all the pieces it’s trying to pull together.
Nevertheless, Life &amp; Beth hits the spot more often than not, and it’s fun to watch Schumer in passion-project mode.
