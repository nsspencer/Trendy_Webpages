     Who Is Candy Montgomery in Hulu’s Upcoming True Crime Miniseries 'Candy'?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a true crime nerd, it’s always exciting to see an adaptation of a crime you have heard/read a lot about.
Plus, true crime is more popular than ever and there are only so many failed tech start-ups we can adapt at one time.
And yes, this is true crime, so Biel’s Candy Montgomery is based on a real person, as is the rest of the story.
Both adaptations will tell the real-life story of Wylie, Texas housewife Candy Montgomery, who brutally murdered her “friend” Betty Gore with an axe in 1980.
Love and Death has Elizabeth Olsen (WandaVision) as Candy Montgomery and Lily Rabe (American Horror Story) as Betty Gore.

     Where Is Candy Montgomery Today? The Story Of The Murderer Includes A Not Guilty Verdict
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Her latest role as Candy Montgomery, an idyllic Southern housewife who turns murderous, might be her most transformative yet.
Their families quickly became close — so close that Montgomery started a year-long affair with Gore’s husband, Allan, after a church volleyball game.
Later, Allan reportedly ended the affair, leaving Montgomery feeling rejected.
A book written about the case, which includes exclusive interviews from both families, revealed Gore confronted Montgomery about the affair that morning while Allan was away on business.
Shortly thereafter, Montgomery left Texas and never returned.
