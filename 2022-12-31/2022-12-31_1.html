     NBA Twitter goes berserk as Jordan Poole, Klay Thompson torch Blazers in comeback Warriors win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jordan Poole, Klay Thompson, and the Dubs entered their Friday night home game against the Portland Trail Blazers owners of the league’s best home record, at 15-2.
But Jordan Poole and Klay Thompson were having none of it.
After Lillard made a layup to put the Blazers up by eight, 110-102, with five minutes left, Jordan Poole and Klay Thompson figured that it was time for the Warriors to stop messing around.
Poole, Thompson, and the unheralded Jonathan Kuminga spurred a 16-2 run that proved to be decisive after Donte DiVincenzo’s dagger three.
While the Warriors as a team stepped up when it mattered, it was Jordan Poole and Klay Thompson who carried them all night long.

While Portland was going 4:08 without a point, Kuminga dunked again to give Golden State a lead it never relinquished.

Thompson finished with 31 points after hitting seven 3-pointers for Golden State, while won its fourth straight at home over the past six days.
