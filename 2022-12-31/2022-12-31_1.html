It’s New Year’s Eve and the city of Atlanta is ready to ring in the New Year with a College Football Playoff party between Ohio State and Georgia in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three decades ago, a quaint era before playoffs and RPOs and NIL, Georgia beat Ohio State in a bowl game that meant little more than bragging rights.
Ohio State coach Ryan Day, left and Georgia coach Kirby Smart stand with the trophy Friday during a news conference ahead of Saturday's Peach Bowl in Atlanta.
“It’s football, and you have to play physical,” Ohio State coach Ryan Day said.
Ohio State counters with Cade Stover, who has 35 catches for 399 yards and five scores.
That will be a key against Stroud and Ohio State, which features a pair of 1,000-yard receivers — Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka Egbuka.
