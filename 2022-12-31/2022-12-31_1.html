    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Dignitaries and religious leaders have been paying tribute to Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, who died Saturday in a monastery in the Vatican at the age of 95.
The funeral of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI will be held on Thursday in St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican City at 9:30 a.m. local time, Bruni said.
The former pope, pictured on September 9, 2007, was known to be more conservative than his successor, Pope Francis.
“In 2013 Pope Benedict took the courageous and humble step to resign the papacy, the first Pope to do so since the fifteenth century.
“I am saddened to learn of the death of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI,” Sunak tweeted Saturday.

     Pope Benedict: Eight years as pope capped long ministry as teacher of faith
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pope Benedict was the first pope to meet with victims of clerical sexual abuse.
Pope Benedict moved to the papal summer villa at Castel Gandolfo Feb. 28, 2013, the day his resignation took effect.
The unusual situation of having a pope and a retired pope both living at the Vatican was working out very well, Pope Francis said.
Having the retired pope nearby to consult with, or ask questions of, Pope Francis said, was "like having a grandfather at home -- a very wise grandfather."
Pope Benedict had said he planned to live a "hidden life" in retirement -- and to a large extent he did.
