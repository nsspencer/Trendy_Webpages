     Ryan Seacrest Recalls New Year’s Eve Jacket Snafu With Taylor Swift And How It Included A Funny Response From The Singer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, back in 2015, Seacrest had a funny jacket snafu, and it involved Taylor Swift of all people.
On top of not being able to communicate with the production team, Swift also offered a surprising and funny response to Seacrest giving her his coat.
Seacrest simply offered Swift, who was in her 1989 era at the time, his jacket since it was a frigid night in New York City.
He got stuck in an elevator, he’s had to deal with celebrities not being ready to perform, and unpredictable weather conditions.
However, Seacrest and YouTube sensation Liza Koshy will be in Times Square with a myriad of performers to welcome 2023.
