     Summary: By Colin Gallant · 2 min readNorth Carolina State radio broadcaster Gary Hahn has been suspended indefinitely after making a reference to “illegal aliens” in El Paso, Texas during the Wolfpack’s loss to Maryland in the Duke’s Mayo Bowl on Friday night.
“Learfield has suspended Wolfpack Sports Network play-by-play announcer Gary Hahn from his agreement indefinitely following comments made during today’s Duke’s Mayo Bowl radio broadcast,” Wolfpack Sports Properties general manager Kyle Winchester said in a statement relayed by the school.
The Sun Bowl canceled its annual fan festival last week because the city’s convention center is being used to house migrants awaiting immigration decisions.
Gary Hahn was the North Carolina Sportscaster of the Year in 2011 and 2020, and has been the voice of N.C. State football and men’s basketball since 1991.
He has previously worked on various sports radio networks covering the University of Louisville, Ohio State University, and the University of Alabama.

     Summary: Nearly a full day since Learfield suspended North Carolina State announcer Gary Hahn, the communications company has failed to further address the ridiculous suspension.
As OutKick’s Ian Miller previously relayed, Hahn was suspended for saying the following during the NC State-Maryland Mayo Bowl: “…Down among all the illegal aliens in El Paso it’s UCLA fourteen and Pittsburgh six.”Here's what got NCSU announcer Gary Hahn immediately and indefinitely suspended after today's broadcast: pic.twitter.com/4qkyQ1jzT2 — Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) December 30, 2022 Gary Hahn was suspended after Friday’s game.
Yet, Learfield not only suspended Hahn, they refrained from stating why they deemed his comment to be worthy of a suspension.
Learfield has gone quiet since suspending Gary Hahn.
