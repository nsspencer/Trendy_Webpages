     Media outlets continue to overlook the LA Clippers’ superstar duo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since joining the LA Clippers, winning has been the name of the game for superstars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.
In Leonard’s case, he has found his rhythm as he has been the Clippers’ most valuable player.
This is one of the main motives to the LA Clippers having one of the top defenses in the league.
The LA Clippers have the best two-way duo in the world with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.
Regardless of their injuries, the LA Clippers’ star duo of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George should be ranked in any top 15 player’s list.

     LA Clippers vs. Indiana Pacers Injury Report Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The LA Clippers are taking on the Indiana Pacers this afternoon in their final game of 2022.
Both Jackson and Batum are being listed as questionable by the Clippers, as Jackson is dealing with Achilles soreness, and Batum is dealing with an ankle sprain.
For the Pacers, they will also be close to full health in this game, as their only absences are G-League players and Daniel Theis.
They will look to defend home court against a Clippers team that defeated them in LA earlier this season.
The Clippers will travel back home after this game to face the Miami Heat on Monday before hitting the road again immediately after.

     Four observations: Tyrese Haliburton scores 18 in fourth to help Pacers beat Clippers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS -- The Pacers beat the Clippers 131-130 to claim their third straight game and fifth win in their last six games.
Tyrese Haliburton closed againJust a few weeks ago, Tyrese Haliburton was lamenting the Pacers' inability to close games.
He scored 18 points in the fourth to finish with 24 for the game and added 10 assists for a double-double.
"I think last game, there was a lot of noise being talked after that game," Turner said.
It was the fourth straight game George has played in Gainbridge Fieldhouse in which he has scored at least 30 points.

     Tyrese Haliburton's brilliant fourth quarter helps surprising Pacers beat Clippers for fifth win in six games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Another game, another win for the red hot Indiana Pacers, who continue to show that they have no desire to tank for Victor Wembanyama.
Myles Turner led the way for the Pacers in the scoring department with 34 points, but the main story from this game was Tyrese Haliburton's stunning fourth quarter.
Eighteen of those points came in the fourth quarter as he stepped up to duel George and hit what turned out to be the game-sealing free throw.
"Tyrese's fourth quarter was monster," Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle said.
In addition to his clutch fourth quarter in this game, he had a career-high 43 points and the game-winning 3-pointer against the Heat on Dec. 23.

     Clippers falter at finish against Pacers despite Paul George’s 45 points
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Some nights it’s great and we do it for a full 48 [minutes], some nights it’s 24 minutes, 26 minutes,” guard Norman Powell said.
En route to a season-high 45 points, George made a step-back three-pointer on the first play and pushed his finger to his lips amid boos.
On his last shot of the quarter, Leonard backed into a three-pointer after seeing not the usual two defenders but a third.
It was the second consecutive game Lue used lineups without a center for extended stretches during the second half.
“We were able to take the lead and go up six or something in the fourth quarter,” Lue said.
