     Mega Millions jackpot now 4th largest in game’s history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (NEXSTAR) – The current Mega Millions jackpot is now the fourth largest in the game’s history after yet another drawing produced no grand-prize winners.
That amount officially qualifies the jackpot as the fourth-largest in Mega Millions history, behind only three relatively recent jackpots that surpassed the billion-dollar mark.
Friday’s press release also noted that January could be a lucky month for players, seeing as one of the game’s only billion-dollar prizes was claimed in January of 2021.
“Will history repeat itself with another billion-dollar January win?” the press release asked, after explaining that the jackpot could easily continue to accumulate throughout the month.
The next Mega Millions drawing is scheduled for Tuesday, Jan. 3.
