     Former pope Benedict XVI dies aged 95
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pope Benedict XVI, who served as leader of the Catholic church from 2005 until his resignation in 2013, died on Saturday aged 95, three days after his successor, Pope Francis, warned the world that he was gravely ill.
It eases the way for his successor, Pope Francis, to consider whether to follow Benedict by retiring at some point – impossible while the outcome would have been three popes.
Earlier this week, Pope Francis announced during his weekly audience that Benedict was “very sick” and asked for people to pray for him.
Benedict, born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger in Germany in 1927, was a deeply conservative pontiff, whose tenure was overshadowed by sexual abuse scandals in the church.
During his tenure, allegations of clerical sexual abuse and its cover-up began to surface.

     Summary: Pope Francis later removed him from a top job in the Vatican.
"In the Catholic Church, symbols are important," said Father Tom Reese, a Washington-based Catholic author and commentator for Religion News Service.
Reese, a Church liberal, found agreement from an unusual source - conservative Australian Cardinal George Pell, a former Vatican treasurer and close associate of Benedict in his retirement.
Reese and others have suggested that a former pontiff be called "bishop emeritus of Rome" and be subject to the rules that cover retired bishops.
He has said he would want to be called Bishop Emeritus of Rome and live not in the Vatican but in a home for retired priests in the Italian capital "because its my diocese".

     Summary: CNN —Dignitaries and religious leaders have been paying tribute to Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, who died Saturday in a monastery in the Vatican at the age of 95.
The funeral of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI will be held on Thursday in St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican City at 9:30 a.m. local time, Bruni said.
The former pope, pictured on September 9, 2007, was known to be more conservative than his successor, Pope Francis.
“In 2013 Pope Benedict took the courageous and humble step to resign the papacy, the first Pope to do so since the fifteenth century.
“I am saddened to learn of the death of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI,” Sunak tweeted Saturday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Like his predecessor John Paul, Benedict made reaching out to Jews a hallmark of his papacy.
His first official act as pope was a letter to Rome’s Jewish community and he became the second pope in history, after John Paul, to enter a synagogue.
The Vatican under Benedict suffered notorious PR gaffes, and sometimes Benedict himself was to blame.
And once he became pope, Benedict essentially reversed his beloved predecessor, John Paul, by taking action against the 20th century’s most notorious pedophile priest, the Rev.
After spending several years teaching theology in Germany, he was appointed bishop of Munich in 1977 and elevated to cardinal three months later by Pope Paul VI.
