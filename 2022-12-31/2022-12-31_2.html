     Another Day, Another Premier League Record For Erling Haaland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Another Day, Another Premier League Record For Erling HaalandErling Haaland set another Premier League record by scoring Manchester City's opening goal against Everton on New Year's Eve.
It was Haaland's 21st Premier League goal for City, coming in only his 15th appearance in the competition.
By firing past Jordan Pickford in the 24th minute, Haaland became the first ever player to score at least 21 goals before the turn of the year in a single Premier League season.

Haaland's 21st goal of the EPL season was not enough to earn City three points against Everton.

     Summary: Haaland has now scored the most goals before the turn of the year in the Premier League (21) 💥 Breaking records again, @ErlingHaaland!
Of course, there were doubts Erling Haaland could come to the Premier League and score at the same ridiculous rate.
The youngster’s 21 tallies have come in just 15 league outings while also bagging five goals in four Champions League appearances.
Also, Haaland is just two goals away from the Premier League Golden Boot winner last season, where Mo Salah and Son Heung-min shared the award with 23 apiece.
You can’t say Erling Haaland isn’t doing his job, though.

Earlier, Demarai Gray scored a stunning equaliser as Everton ended 2022 by snatching an unexpected point against Manchester City.
Marcus Rashford climbed off the bench and the naughty step to fire Manchester United to victory at Wolves.
Fabian Schar passed up a hat-trick of chances as Newcastle's hopes of a seventh successive Premier League win were dashed by Leeds.
Southampton will begin 2023 at the foot of the Premier League after a last-gasp Joao Palhinha goal condemned them to a 2-1 defeat at Fulham.

     Summary: Arsenal’s Gabriel Martinelli (right) celebrates against Brighton (Adam Davy/PA).
(PA Wire)Premier League leaders Arsenal moved seven points clear at the top going into the new year after a glorious Gabriel Martinelli goal capped a thrilling 4-2 victory at Brighton.
Goals from Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Eddie Nketiah set the Gunners on course for a fifth consecutive top-flight success to cement their status as serious title contenders.
Kaoru Mitoma reduced Albion’s deficit 25 minutes from time before Martinelli, aided by a wonderful Odegaard assist, raced half the length of the pitch to stylishly restore the three-goal advantage.
Seagulls substitute Evan Ferguson increased the tension going into the final stages by claiming his first Premier League goal, while Mitoma thought he had set up a grandstand finish, only for his 89th-minute strike to be disallowed for offside.

     Summary: It's time to treat Arsenal like the front runners in the Premier League title race following an impressive 4-2 victory over Brighton on Saturday.
Despite 21 Premier League goals from Erling Haaland, it has been City's defense letting them down as the team have only won one of three matches where they've scored one goal this season.
It's a long season but so far when they've needed points, the Gunners l have gotten the job done.
Second in scoring behind only Manchester City, Arsenal have scored 11 more goals than any other team in the league with four players scoring five or more goals.
On a day where everything was coming up for Arsenal, Dec. 31 could pave the way to potentially and unexpectedly winning the league.

     GW18 FPL stats: Managers regret U-turn on Mitrovic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The second most-sold player over the season break, Mitrovic overcame a foot injury to score 15 points on Boxing Day, his biggest haul of the season.
But the Serb saw his stoppage-time penalty saved by Gavin Bazunu (£4.5m) and lost two points to return zero overall.
Marcus Rashford (£6.8m) gained over 525,000 new owners after his third double-figure return of the campaign in Gameweek 17.
Haaland rewarded those managers with a goal but a booking also limited the striker's return to five points.
Second in the Fantasy player standings behind Haaland, Harry Kane (£11.6m) has been backed by 402,000+ for the captaincy.

     Erling Haaland scripts unique record after scoring his 21st Premier League goal against Everton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Erling Haaland continued to shatter records as he became the first player to score the highest number of goals by a player before the turn of the year in a single Premier League season when he scored his 21st goal in the league against Everton.
Earlier in the week, against Leeds, Haaland became the fastest player to score 20 goals in the Premier League after he completed a brace at Elland Road.
He also surpassed his father Alfie Haaland’s entire Premier League goal tally (18), that too against his father’s former club, in the city Haaland was born.
In the match, the Norwegian looked to have put the defending champions on course for victory in a scrappy Premier League contest at the Etihad Stadium.
It ended a run of three straight league losses for Everton and eased some of the pressure on manager Frank Lampard.
