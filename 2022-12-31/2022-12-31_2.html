     Summary: Joe Biden - only the second Catholic to serve as US president - said Pope Benedict "will be remembered as a renowned theologian, with a lifetime of devotion to the Church, guided by his principles and faith".
Mr Biden singled out the pope's remarks during a 2008 visit to the White House in which the former pontiff said "the need for global solidarity is as urgent as ever, if all people are to live in a way worthy of their dignity".

     Why retired pope Benedict's funeral will be so unusual
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When retired Pope Benedict XVI is laid to rest on Thursday, it will be an event unprecedented in the modern history of the Catholic Church.
Not only was Benedict the first modern pope to step down, but his funeral will be highly unusual because the sitting pope will preside over the funeral of a former one.
Benedict's funeral mass is scheduled to take place on Thursday in St. Peter's Square.
A rare spectacle where a sitting pope will preside over the funeral of a former oneThe Holy See Press Office announced that Pope Francis will preside over Benedict's funeral — a notable event in the history of the Church, given that it customarily took a pope's passing for a new leader to be chosen.
On Wednesday, the Holy See Press Office said Francis visited Benedict and asked the community for prayer regarding his health.

     Former Pope Benedict XVI asks for forgiveness, thanks God in final letter before death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Former Pope Benedict XVI, who died Saturday in a monastery in the Vatican at the age of 95, asked for forgiveness for those he has “wronged” in the spiritual testament published following his death.
During the testament, which consisted of a letter containing the pope’s final words, Benedict spoke of the “many reasons” he had to be thankful for his life.
In the letter dated August 29, 2006, the former pope thanked God for guiding him “well” throughout life.
In the 2006 letter, the former pope asked “sincerely” for “forgiveness” for those he “wronged in any way,” in his letter.
There is no suggestion his request for forgiveness in his final letter relates to the Catholic Church’s handling of sexual abuse accusations against priests.

     Pope Benedict: Eight years as pope capped long ministry as teacher of faith
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pope Benedict was the first pope to meet with victims of clerical sexual abuse.
Pope Benedict moved to the papal summer villa at Castel Gandolfo Feb. 28, 2013, the day his resignation took effect.
The unusual situation of having a pope and a retired pope both living at the Vatican was working out very well, Pope Francis said.
Having the retired pope nearby to consult with, or ask questions of, Pope Francis said, was "like having a grandfather at home -- a very wise grandfather."
Pope Benedict had said he planned to live a "hidden life" in retirement -- and to a large extent he did.
