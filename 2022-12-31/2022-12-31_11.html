     Struggling Jazz come home to face Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s the last game of 2022 season for the Utah Jazz and it will be one of their most difficult home games.
It’s the third game in four nights for the Jazz and the back end of a back-to-back.
They’ll be facing a hungry Miami Heat team that is coming off a tough loss against the Denver Nuggets and are looking to turn their season around.
Were the Jazz for real to start the season, or was there a lot of fluke wins going on?
That record of 19-19 is about right for this team and, if the Jazz don’t make any changes, is likely about what the Jazz will be.
