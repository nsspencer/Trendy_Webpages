     Why Celtics’ Jayson Tatum downplayed Warriors loss in NBA Finals rematch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — The lights and stakes don’t get much higher for a regular season game in December than it did Saturday.
The Celtics and Warriors met for the first time since last season’s NBA Finals, putting a spotlight on the marquee matchup.
The Celtics looked uncomfortable as their leader, Jayson Tatum, had one of the worst games of his young season.
Yet, even after such a tough loss, Tatum was far from overreacting to a long season.
It’s frustrating to lose, Tatum said, but there are still plenty of games left in the season to flip the page.

     Summary: A Celtics win, and they'd be hearing the "changing of the guard" narrative every day until their next matchup in Boston in mid-January.
"I thought we needed a game like that," Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said after the win.
"It's not easy when you're tasked with chasing those guys, but it's what you cherish as competitors -- playing against the best of the best.
Obviously teams miss shots, but Kerr thought Golden State's defensive tenacity caused problems for Boston.
So it was a good feeling tonight to win a game like that."

     Summary: Jayson Tatum: Loss to Warriors 'not going to dictate our season' originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonJayson Tatum's struggles against the Golden State Warriors continued in Saturday night's NBA Finals rematch.
The Boston Celtics star was given a harsh reminder of last summer as the Warriors earned a 123-107 victory at Chase Center.
Tatum was limited to 18 points -- his second-lowest total of the season -- while shooting a lackluster 6-for-21 from the floor.
As great as Tatum has been all season long, the Celtics need more from the NBA MVP frontrunner in these marquee matchups.
Tatum and the Celtics will look to respond Monday when their road trip continues in Los Angeles.
