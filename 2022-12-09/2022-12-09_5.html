     The Suns and Pelicans Genuinely Hate Each Other
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Suns hate the fact that Zion Williamson threw down an acrobatic dunk in the dying seconds on Friday when the game was already over.
“Get back on defense.”One major subplot to watch here is Jose Alvarado versus Chris Paul.
A better look at the cheap shot from Chris Paul on Jose Alvarado as CP3 hit Jose in his injured ribs on a drive to the basket.
And remember, Friday’s matchup didn’t even feature Herb Jones, who also can’t stand Paul and the Suns.
The Suns and Pelicans may very well meet again in the playoffs, and not just in the first round either.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With five seconds left in Friday’s contest, Phoenix Suns guard Chris Paul missed a layup at a scoreline of 126-117 against the New Orleans Pelicans.
Larry Nance Jr. grabbed the rebound and threw it ahead to Zion Williamson, who did not decide to run the clock out and instead made a statement with a 360 windmill.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN… ZION WILLIAMSON.
pic.twitter.com/MhjV7Zpl0R — New Orleans Pelicans (@PelicansNBA) December 10, 2022Paul made his way toward the Pelicans bench to voice his displeasure with a group he has connections to, like head coach Willie Green.
Phoenix head coach Monty Williams appeared frustrated that everyone was still out on the court and directed his entire team off, grabbing Paul.

     Zion Williamson’s showboat dunk at end of Pelicans’ win angers Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zion Williamson apologized for his 360-degree, one-handed slam dunk that angered the Phoenix Suns at the end of a game the New Orleans Pelicans had all but won.
The dunk contest-style jam capped a season-high 35-point performance for Williamson, and the Pelicans beat the Suns 128-117 on Friday night in a matchup of the top two teams in the Western Conference.
“But I was in that locker room when my brothers were down because the Suns sent us home [from the playoffs] last year.
CJ McCollum had 18 points for the Pelicans, who have won six straight and 11 of 13, and afterward questioned the Suns’ reaction to Williamson’s dunk.
“They got to get back on defense if they don’t want us to dunk the ball,” McCollum said.

     In Friday win over Suns, Pelicans provided plenty more reasons for excitement to build about team's present, future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Perhaps a similar message should apply to the New Orleans fan base, and even local media members as well: Walk away.
Don’t waste energy and focus on the final 2 seconds of Friday’s matchup between elite Western Conference teams and whatever that was.
Instead, run headfirst to the previous 47:58 of action, when the Pelicans provided a laundry list of reasons for 16,000-plus attendees to be thoroughly entertained, capped by Williamson’s 360 slam.
Reasons why New Orleans (17-8, tops in the West after a 128-117 victory) once again demonstrated that the future of the franchise – and increasingly, the present as well – is so bright.
The Pelicans are 11-3 overall at home this season (only Boston, Cleveland, Golden State and Memphis have fewer home defeats).

     Summary: Let's relive the last 33.5 seconds of Friday's matchup between the Phoenix Suns and the New Orleans Pelicans.
33.5 to 25.9: With the Suns down seven, Chris Paul tries to create against Jose Alvarado.
He could dribble the ball out, but instead chucks it ahead to Larry Nance Jr. for an uncontested layup.
Payne had the most to say on the Suns' side, all in the name of ... sportsmanship.
We aren't that far removed from Williamson's commitment level — to himself, and to the Pelicans at large — being questioned.

    </h2>

     Summary: NEW ORLEANS – Zion Williamson’s dunk wasn’t the real reason behind the altercation between the New Orleans Pelicans and the Phoenix Suns on Friday night.
This is the NBA’s newest rivalry, and it’s already fantastic on a number of levels.
Yet there was one massive difference that separated these teams on Friday night: Zion Williamson.
Like Paul, Alvarado has made his name in the league by using his grit and intelligence to overcome his physical limitations.
But it’s a blessing.”(Top photo of Zion Williamson dunking: Ned Dishman / NBAE via Getty Images)
