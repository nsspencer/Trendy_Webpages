     Emancipation review – Will Smith is dragged through the mud in ugly, manipulative drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Antoine Fuqua’s thuddingly unsubtle Will Smith-starring slavery drama is an unusually ugly picture.
Smith, fresh from his Oscar-winning performance in King Richard last year, delivers a physically committed turn as a character loosely based on a real person.
Peter is a man of faith and a loving husband and father who has kept his family together and safe, although they live as slaves.
Finding himself cruelly separated from his wife and children, he escapes through the Louisiana swamps, outwitting alligators and Ben Foster’s sneering, sadistic overseer.
In a chase picture that evolves into a war movie, the storytelling is propulsive, but it’s cheapened by crude and manipulative film-making choices.

     Will Smith Isn’t the Main Reason to Avoid Emancipation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In an apology, he wrote, “I hope my actions don’t distract from the film’s message.”If only Emancipation actually had a memorable message.
The film casts Smith as Peter, a character based on the photo’s subject who, after learning of Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, runs away to find Union troops.
One character explains that Peter can “survive things most men can’t,” turning Peter’s story into, essentially, a superhero saga.
By turning Peter into a warrior, the film undermines the very figure it’s trying to honor.
But by turning Peter into an action hero, the director fails to offer new or nuanced insights into these themes.

     ‘Emancipation’ is the only movie Will Smith could do next
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While by no means a perfect film, “Emancipation” — in which Smith plays the real-life heroic Peter, an enslaved man who escapes to freedom — is certainly the perfect follow-up role for Smith, who cast himself as a villain on the Academy Awards stage in March after slapping comedian Chris Rock for making a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.
AdvertisementAt its core, “Emancipation,” which premiered Friday on Apple TV Plus after debuting in theaters last week, is a rumination on the power of love.
AdvertisementThe most interesting minutes of the film happen in the swamp, where Smith the actor is without his crutches: that famous voice and booming laugh.
Smith always wanted to be Superman, the kind of hero who could swoop in and save the damsel in distress.
“I had to humble down and realize that I’m a flawed human.”AdvertisementIn “Emancipation,” Smith gets to play both sides of that experience.
