LADIES AND GENTLEMEN… ZION WILLIAMSON.
pic.twitter.com/MhjV7Zpl0R — New Orleans Pelicans (@PelicansNBA) December 10, 2022Paul made his way toward the Pelicans bench to voice his displeasure with a group he has connections to, like head coach Willie Green.
Phoenix head coach Monty Williams appeared frustrated that everyone was still out on the court and directed his entire team off, grabbing Paul.

     Zion Williamson’s showboat dunk at end of Pelicans’ win angers Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zion Williamson apologized for his 360-degree, one-handed slam dunk that angered the Phoenix Suns at the end of a game the New Orleans Pelicans had all but won.
The dunk contest-style jam capped a season-high 35-point performance for Williamson, and the Pelicans beat the Suns 128-117 on Friday night in a matchup of the top two teams in the Western Conference.
“But I was in that locker room when my brothers were down because the Suns sent us home [from the playoffs] last year.
CJ McCollum had 18 points for the Pelicans, who have won six straight and 11 of 13, and afterward questioned the Suns’ reaction to Williamson’s dunk.
“They got to get back on defense if they don’t want us to dunk the ball,” McCollum said.

     In Friday win over Suns, Pelicans provided plenty more reasons for excitement to build about team's present, future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Perhaps a similar message should apply to the New Orleans fan base, and even local media members as well: Walk away.
Don’t waste energy and focus on the final 2 seconds of Friday’s matchup between elite Western Conference teams and whatever that was.
Instead, run headfirst to the previous 47:58 of action, when the Pelicans provided a laundry list of reasons for 16,000-plus attendees to be thoroughly entertained, capped by Williamson’s 360 slam.
Reasons why New Orleans (17-8, tops in the West after a 128-117 victory) once again demonstrated that the future of the franchise – and increasingly, the present as well – is so bright.
The Pelicans are 11-3 overall at home this season (only Boston, Cleveland, Golden State and Memphis have fewer home defeats).
