     Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Trailer Reveals Gameplay, March 17 Release Date
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the sequel to 2019's Jedi: Fallen Order, got a March 17, 2023, release date during Thursday's Game Awards, along with a new trailer giving us our first look at gameplay, some returning characters and a bunch of new faces.
Thursday's trailer was more about gameplay than narrative, but we caught glimpses of Cal's mentor Cere Junda (who's shaved her head) and new mercenary ally Bode Akuna.
On the gameplay side, the trailer showed off Cal's new traversal options like an ascension cable to and the ability to tame and ride creatures.
"I think that you'd have to be made of stone for it to not hit you in the heart."
That puts the events of Jedi: Survivor around the same time as the Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney Plus series and four years before the start of Andor.

     Star Wars Jedi: Survivor: Cameron Monaghan Interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order arrived in November 2019, Cameron Monaghan had an easy holiday gift for family and friends.
Monaghan had played the game’s protagonist, Cal Kestis, a Padawan survivor of Order 66, so it made for something of a perfect present.
As a joke, Monaghan would sit near friends, echoing the game’s dialogue or Cal’s grunts and screams as they happened on-screen.
!’”In Jedi: Fallen Order, set during the age of the Empire and Jedi-hunting Inquisitors, Cal was just looking to lay low and exist until fate intervened.
This game is really ambitious in how much it is furthering and progressing not only the gameplay elements from Jedi: Fallen Order, but also furthering the story and the characters as well,” Monaghan says.
