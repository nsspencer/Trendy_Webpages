     Miami Heat: Victor Oladipo Brings A Different Energy To Rotation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After missing nearly the whole season for the Miami Heat due to a knee recovery process, Victor Oladipo finally returned to NBA action against the Houston Rockets.
They had traded for him last year, but he only played four games for the Heat before going down last season.
The return of Oladipo could not have come for a better time for the Heat either.
While Oladipo begins his adjustment back to the NBA pace, let’s take a look at the player that the Miami Heat are adding to their already stacked roster.
Who is Victor Oladipo?
