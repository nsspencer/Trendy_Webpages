     Summary: Spotify is one of the most popular platforms to enjoy almost every genre of music, podcasts, and more.
If you continue to experience issues, the entire platform is likely down and you should check a few reliable sources for updates.
The account typically updates in real-time, so check back every few minutes for new information.
You can also mention the Spotify Cares account to talk with a representative or visit the Spotify Support page.
Spotify typically comes back after a few minutes, so try to stay calm until the problems are resolved.
