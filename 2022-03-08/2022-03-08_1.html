     Seahawks Plan to Trade Russell Wilson to the Broncos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russell Wilson, the face of the Seattle Seahawks for the past decade, is expected to head to Denver as part of a multi-player trade with the Broncos.
The deal cannot proceed until Wilson waives his no-trade clause and cannot be finalized until every player in the deal passes a physical.
No formal announcement will be made by the teams involved until the new league year begins on March 16.
Those speed bumps aside, Wilson, who was voted to nine Pro Bowls and led Seattle to its only Super Bowl title after the 2013 season, will instantly make the Broncos a contender in the already competitive A.F.C.
The Broncos finished last in the division the past two years and have not played in the postseason since the 2015 season, when they won the Super Bowl.

     Seahawks tweet joke on Russell Wilson trade, fans react
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everyone handles breakups differently but the Seahawks decided to get a little cute with the reported departure of Russell Wilson and its not going over well with NFL fans.
After it was reported that Seattle sent Wilson to Denver in a massive trade, the Broncos had some fun and Tweeted a gif of the movie Cast Away featuring the main character’s best friend, Wilson, who is a volleyball.
Teams are not allowed to say anything officially about the trade until March 16, hence the non-direct reference.
Fans didn’t care for the tweet and didn’t hold back in the mentions or quote tweets.

     What the Russell Wilson news means for the Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the emergence of the of the news that both Aaron Rogers and Russell Wilson have signed with other teams, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have all but solidified that next season will be a down year compared to the last two seasons.
To be fair, absolutely no one expected Tom Brady to sign with the Bucs before he did, so crazier things have indeed happened.
Given the options, the Bucs would be foolish not to simply cut their losses and start rebuilding with Trask at the helm.
It would be far more beneficial for the Bucs to let Trask play and see if he can handle it now rather than later.
Maybe he’s good, maybe he’s terrible, but either way, the Bucs need to give him a chance to show it.

     Seahawks Officially Enter New Era With Departure of Russell Wilson, Bobby Wagner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Back in 2012, Bobby Wagner and Russell Wilson joined the Seahawks as unheralded day two draft choices.
Less than 24 hours later, reports surfaced indicating the team had informed Wagner of his release.
When the Seahawks used second and third-round picks to select Wagner and Wilson a decade ago, nobody could have foreseen the immense success the pair would enjoy in the Pacific Northwest.
Statistically, few players in the NFL were more productive or durable at their respective positions than Wagner and Wilson during their decade starring together.
At the quarterback spot, the Seahawks did acquire former first-round pick Drew Lock as part of their blockbuster deal shipping Wilson to the Seahawks.
