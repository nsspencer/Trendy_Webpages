     Guy Reffitt: First trial of US Capitol riot ends with conviction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With their verdict, members of the jury in Reffitt's trial showed that they believe the Capitol siege was an assault on democracy.
They also made it clear that they thought that Reffitt's claim, that he was just a big talker and meant no harm, was beside the point.

     Guy Reffitt, first Jan. 6 rioter to go to trial, found guilty on all counts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — The first Jan. 6 defendant to take his case to trial was found guilty Tuesday of all charges related to his role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Jurors began deliberating Tuesday morning after a weeklong trial in which they heard testimony from Reffitt's teenage son, Jackson Reffitt, who tipped off the FBI about his father before the Jan. 6 attack.
After the jury's unanimous verdict, Reffitt sat at the defense table and fiddled with his mask as talked to his lawyer.
Over and over again — both before and after Jan. 6 — Reffitt recorded himself in various forums talking about what he planned to do and what he did.
More than 750 people have been arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, and hundreds more cases are in the works.

     The Son Who Brought Down His Insurrectionist Father
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Reffitt case was the department’s first demonstration of its strategic and tactical approach to the January 6 trials, and the result should incentivize more defendants to plead out.
As the Reffitt trial showed, however, it is far from clear how rational all of these defendants are, since Reffitt himself had no real defense to the charges against him.
Take the House!’”By far the most heavily anticipated witness was Reffitt’s son, Jackson, who provided several riveting hours of testimony.
There was no evidence Reffitt had ever abused anyone in the family or that Jackson was seriously worried about his or his sister’s physical safety.
In an ideal world, Guy Reffitt would, at some point, find a way to be very proud of his son.
