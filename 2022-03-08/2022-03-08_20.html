     Grand Jury Appears Set to Weigh Charges Against Deshaun Watson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ten women filed criminal complaints against Watson, the Houston Texans quarterback, last year, accusing him of sexual misconduct during massage sessions, according to Houston police records.
Three of the complaints allege sexual assault or attempted sexual assault, defined in Texas as nonconsensual penetration.
Prosecutors are expected to present at least some of these cases to the grand jury, which will decide if criminal charges will be brought against Watson.
Watson has denied any wrongdoing, and it is possible the grand jury will decide not to indict him for any crime.
He’s hoping that the grand jury will make a decision about Watson on Friday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A grand jury will hear evidence Friday in the case involving Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson, the same day he also will face questions for the first time in at least some of his pending civil lawsuits.
"I'm not going to let him answer questions from anybody before that grand jury has made its decision.
The New York Times first reported Tuesday that several of the women who have filed criminal complaints against Watson have been subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury Friday.
The grand jury process does not require a unanimous vote.
"Once the grand jury process is concluded we intend for him to start answering questions in depositions," Hardin said.

     Reports: Criminal Case Against Deshaun Watson to be Presented to Grand Jury Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In terms of a potential criminal case, there could be some clarity concerning Deshaun Watson's situation this week.
The New York Times reported Tuesday that the 10 women who made criminal complaints against the Houston Texans quarterback for sexual misconduct have received subpoenas to appear before a grand jury Friday.
Watson had 22 civil cases filed against him dating back to last March, but no criminal charges have officially been filed.
That could change Friday when the district attorney presents a criminal case, but Rusty Hardin, Watson's lawyer, feels like his client, who's allegedly committed the misconduct during massage sessions, will avoid charges.
If there are no criminal charges brought against him this week, it opens up the opportunity for the Texans to make a deal with another team.

Eight women who filed criminal complaints against the Texans quarterback have been subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury Friday, according to their attorney, Tony Buzbee.
Watson will also be deposed in two of the civil cases filed against him Friday, via Nicki Jhabvala of The Washington Post.
