     Jackson State coach Deion Sanders has two toes amputated after foot surgery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jackson State football coach and Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders recently had surgery on his injured foot which resulted in the amputation of two toes on his left foot.
The procedure is discussed in an episode of the SMAC Entertainment and Barstool Sports series, "Coach Prime", which detailed his three-week stay in a Mississippi hospital.
Sanders, 54, had his big toe and the second toe on his foot amputated and he lost 35 pounds during his stay.
Sanders was diagnosed with three femoral arterial blood clots, which doctors categorized as life-threatening and left the coach wheelchair bound for the latter part of Jackson State's season.
"They were first talking about the amputation of toes, then the amputation of my leg from knee down, and then they were trying to ensure that I had life," Sanders said.
