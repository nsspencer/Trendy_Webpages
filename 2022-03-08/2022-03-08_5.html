     ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill: Florida Senate passes controversial LGBTQ school measure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The measure, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by its opponents, was passed by the state House last month and now heads to Republican Gov.
“This is going to endanger the safety of our LGBTQ students and adolescents,” Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Democrat, said during Tuesday’s debate.
Supporters of the bill say it’s about allowing parents to have control over their children’s education, while opponents say it unfairly targets the LGBTQ community.
Last week, students across Florida staged school walkouts in protest against the bill, which they decried as the state’s latest measure to limit the rights of LGBTQ students.
We stand with our LGBTQ+ students in Florida and across the country, and urge Florida leaders to make sure all their students are protected and supported."

     Tension, condemnations rise as “Don’t say Gay” bill nears vote in Florida Senate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christina Pushaw tweeted Friday in support of the bill that would restrict certain conversations on LGBTQ issues in Florida’s public school classrooms.
The bill is officially called “Parental Rights in Education,” but opponents have been referring to it as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill due to its potential chilling effect in Florida classrooms regarding LGBTQ issues and students.
The LGBTQ community, for example, is worried that students could be “outed” to an unsupportive family, potentially putting LGBTQ students in harm’s way.
HB 1557 was dubbed a “hateful bill” by President Joe Biden on Twitter in early February.
Some senators have offered amendments addressing concerns about the bill, and the Senate will have the opportunity to approve or dismiss those changes.
