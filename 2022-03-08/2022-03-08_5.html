"He deserved it [the suspension], he deserved the three, he did a stupid thing," Guardiola told a news conference on Tuesday.

Yes, the more suspiciously minded could point to Mohamed Salah leaving his shooting boots in the dressing room for once.
But aside from the sheer randomness of this sport, there was little that might have taken this tie away from Liverpool.
Henderson would not try the risky pass over the top but instead ensured that possession remained with Liverpool.
That was true of Liverpool as a whole on the night and across this tie.

Salzburg can hold their heads highThe nature of this defeat should not take away from what has been a historic Champions League outing for Salzburg.
While the misses won't matter as they're off to the next round, it's something that the Reds will need to clean up because the margins only get tighter in the business end of the Champions League.

Lautaro Martinez had given Inter a slither of hope against Liverpool in their Champions League tie when his long range shot whizzed away from Virgil van Dijk and Alisson into the top corner.
Inzaghi was preserving the win and aiming to go out with heads held high.
Inter would’ve fancied their chances against the Dutch side, but Liverpool was always going to be a step too far.
But despite the elimination, Inter demonstrated that they aren’t 100 miles away from making a deep run in the competition next year.
