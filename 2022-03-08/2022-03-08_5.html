    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple’s latest product showcase on Tuesday had all the hallmarks of a typical launch for the world’s most valuable public company: vibrant colors, upbeat music, a slate of incremental product improvements and a surprise.
In a video presentation, the company unveiled a new, faster iPhone SE, the entry-level version of its flagship product, bumping the price to $429 from the older version’s $399.
Apple also introduced a speedier iPad Air tablet for $599.
And it announced the Mac Studio, a powerful desktop computer that is like an upgraded version of the Mac Mini.
Apple also said that two weekly Friday night Major League Baseball games would begin airing exclusively on Apple TV Plus, the company’s streaming service.

     Apple announces low-cost iPhone with 5G, faster chip for Macs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — Apple on Tuesday announced a new version of its low-cost iPhone SE that includes 5G connectivity, a new iPad Air and a faster chip for its desktop Mac computers.
The $429 price point is a slight increase from the previous iPhone SE model, priced at $399.
The iPhone SE comes with an A15 Bionic chip, which Apple says is the fastest among competition, a 4.7-inch retina display and a home button with touch ID.
The new iPad Air gets its first refresh in two years with a new design, 5G connectivity and a faster M1 chipset, popular in MacBooks.
The United States, Japan and Western Europe have been the top markets for iPhone SE sales in recent years, according to researcher IDC.

     Apple unveils first budget 5G iPhone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the standout product was a new budget iPhone with access to 5G networks.
Apple's new iPhone SE, only the third version since the model launched in 2017, runs on the company's faster A15 Bionic chip, the same in-house processor that drives the iPhone 13 line.
When Apple released its second version of the iPhone SE in April 2020, the budget smartphone seemed well-suited for the moment.
"Consumers were uncertain about the outlook and an affordable iPhone was ideally placed to take advantage of that," said Ben Wood, an analyst with market research firm CCS Insight.
"In 2022 things have improved but the iPhone SE franchise still fills an important role as an affordable iPhone for consumers still cautious about splashing out on a top-of-the-line iPhone or who just don't feel the need to spend more than is necessary."
