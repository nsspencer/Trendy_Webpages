     Summary: The first elimination day is upon us in the Champions League knockout stage, and at the halfway mark in three of these four ties, there still looks to be plenty to play for.
Still, as others have garnered headlines they absolutely deserve, Mane has been delivering for Liverpool under the radar.
Real Madrid vs. PSG: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯It is one of the great joys of PSG in the Champions League.
But do the same rules apply when the one absentee is the player who has been the most devastating in the Champions League?
Carlo Ancelotti, the grand old duke of European football, seemed to have been completely discombobulated by the absence of away goals from this season's Champions League.
