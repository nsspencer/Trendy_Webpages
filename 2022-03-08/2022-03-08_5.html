"He deserved it [the suspension], he deserved the three, he did a stupid thing," Guardiola told a news conference on Tuesday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But things aren't all doom and gloom for the Nerazzurri, and the team should see this first knockout fixture that they've played in more than ten years as a new beginning, rather than an abrupt ending.
This is a team that in past years struggled to get through the group stage under Luciano Spalletti and Antonio Conte.
If we look at the starting eleven that played at Anfield, the whole starting defense had never played in a Champions League knockout.
And everybody will be left to wonder what might have been if the team Inter were initially slated to play, Ajax, had been their opponent.
But Inter fans should see this elimination as the first step in their European journey, one that can be improved upon next season.

Simone Inzaghi will wonder what could have been, especially after his side had 29 minutes after the opening goal to find another breakthrough.
Salzburg can hold their heads highThe nature of this defeat should not take away from what has been a historic Champions League outing for Salzburg.
While the misses won't matter as they're off to the next round, it's something that the Reds will need to clean up because the margins only get tighter in the business end of the Champions League.
