Yes, the more suspiciously minded could point to Mohamed Salah leaving his shooting boots in the dressing room for once.
But aside from the sheer randomness of this sport, there was little that might have taken this tie away from Liverpool.
Henderson would not try the risky pass over the top but instead ensured that possession remained with Liverpool.
That was true of Liverpool as a whole on the night and across this tie.
