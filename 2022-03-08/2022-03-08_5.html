"He deserved it [the suspension], he deserved the three, he did a stupid thing," Guardiola told a news conference on Tuesday.

"We are lucky to have two great goalkeepers at PSG because I wanted to do it and the club did it.
We respect Real and their players -- it is no coincidence they have won 13 Champions League titles.
"Real will not change the way they play apart from injured or suspended players," said the PSG tactician.
"PSG and Real is always 50-50 and there are no favorites -- two strong teams.

Simone Inzaghi will wonder what could have been, especially after his side had 29 minutes after the opening goal to find another breakthrough.
Salzburg can hold their heads highThe nature of this defeat should not take away from what has been a historic Champions League outing for Salzburg.
While the misses won't matter as they're off to the next round, it's something that the Reds will need to clean up because the margins only get tighter in the business end of the Champions League.

     Summary: After all, it has been Sadio Mane of late making the big contributions in Premier League games.
Without his poacher's instinct, who knows how much more arduous Saturday's 1-0 win over West Ham might have been?
Still, as others have garnered headlines they absolutely deserve, Mane has been delivering for Liverpool under the radar.
His expected goals (xG) per 90 is 0.56, more than 20 percent higher than any of the preceding four seasons.
If so, Liverpool can be sure that Mane will put himself in position to make an impact.
