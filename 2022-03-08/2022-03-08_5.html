Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Offside via Getty ImagesManchester City boss Pep Guardiola has blasted "stupid" Kyle Walker for picking up a Champions League suspension that has left him without a right-back for the round-of-16 second-leg tie with Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday.
- Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+ (U.S. only)- Don't have ESPN?
"He deserved it [the suspension], he deserved the three, he did a stupid thing," Guardiola told a news conference on Tuesday.

     Summary: "The best way to defend a lead for a team like PSG is to attack and dominate," Pochettino said at his press conference.
"We are lucky to have two great goalkeepers at PSG because I wanted to do it and the club did it.
We respect Real and their players -- it is no coincidence they have won 13 Champions League titles.
"Real will not change the way they play apart from injured or suspended players," said the PSG tactician.
"PSG and Real is always 50-50 and there are no favorites -- two strong teams.

    </h2>

     Summary: Around this time four years ago Luka Modric was being linked with a move away from Real Madrid.
A near ever-present in the Champion League, Modric has also started 19 times in La Liga this term, only missing out due to minor injury issues and a bout of Covid in December.
“For me it's a pleasure to play alongside Kroos and Modric,” Casemiro said after the 4-1 win over Sociedad.
He knows what it takes to win the Champions League, four times in all, and knows that their opponent’s desperation could work in their favour.

     Summary: The first elimination day is upon us in the Champions League knockout stage, and at the halfway mark in three of these four ties, there still looks to be plenty to play for.
Still, as others have garnered headlines they absolutely deserve, Mane has been delivering for Liverpool under the radar.
Real Madrid vs. PSG: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯It is one of the great joys of PSG in the Champions League.
But do the same rules apply when the one absentee is the player who has been the most devastating in the Champions League?
Carlo Ancelotti, the grand old duke of European football, seemed to have been completely discombobulated by the absence of away goals from this season's Champions League.
