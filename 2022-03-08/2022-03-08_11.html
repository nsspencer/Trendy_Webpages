    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Is Ukraine getting extra fighter planes from Poland?
Its air force, though still flying, remains outnumbered by its opponent.
However, any new planes need to be ones that Ukraine’s pilots are trained to use.
But if the US is transferring the fighters to Ukraine, Russia may not want to engage the Americans directly.
If what is left of Ukraine’s air force were to sustain further losses it would soon reach the point where it is unable to defend itself from attack in the skies.

     US rejects Poland’s offer to send MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The United States has rejected Poland’s offer to send its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine via a US airbase in Germany, saying the proposal raised “serious concerns” for the entire NATO alliance.
Warsaw made the surprise offer on Tuesday amid repeated appeals from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for more warplanes to replenish his country’s air force as it defends against invading Russian forces.
The Polish scheme proposed that the Russian made MiG-29 fighter jets be delivered to a US base in Ramstein, Germany, and then be deployed to Ukraine.
Ukraine’s air force fleet consists of ageing Soviet-era MiG-29 and Sukhoi-27 jets, and heavier Sukhoi-25 jets – and these are the only planes Ukrainian pilots could fly immediately without additional training.
Russia has warned that supporting Ukraine’s air force would be seen in Moscow as participating in the conflict and open up suppliers to possible retaliation.

     Summary: ExplainedThe United States has rejected an offer by Poland to hand over its MiG-29 fighter jets as part of a plan to supply more aircraft to Ukrainian forces.
Nato member Poland offered to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to a US air base Ramstein in Germany as a way to replenish Ukraine’s air force.
The Mikoyan MiG-29 (Fulcrum) is a lightweight, twin-engine jet fighter aircraft designed in the former Soviet Union.
It was developed in the 1970s to counter US fighter jets and first entered service with the Soviet Air Force in the early 1980s.
Although, only 23 of these fighter jets are reported to be active by FlightGlobal.com.

     Poland says it’s ready to deploy all their MiG-29 fighter jets to US air base in Germany

     Summary: Poland said on Tuesday that it was ready to deploy — immediately and free of charge — all their MiG-29 fighter jets to the US Air Force’s Ramstein Air Base in Germany and place them at the disposal of Washington to provide them to Ukraine, according to a statement from the Polish foreign ministry.
“At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities.
Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,” it added.
A senior US defense official, meanwhile, told CNN that they've seen the Polish government’s announcement and "have nothing to offer at this time."
The Polish announcement comes after some Polish officials were frustrated by how forward leaning the US was on this subject over the weekend, the sources said.

“The less we can say, the more we can do.”How Would The Fighter Deal Work?
Based on the statement from Warsaw, Poland is willing to accept older F-16 models, as opposed to new planes.

     Poland to Make MiG-29 Combat Jets Available to U.S.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Giving Ukraine combat jets would mark the highest-profile step in a massive effort by NATO members and other allies to supply weapons to the embattled country as it tries to repel Russian troop advances.
Poland had emerged as the leading Western contender to provide planes to Ukraine because the country operates modernized MiG-29 fighter planes that Ukrainian pilots likely could operate.
And not every Western country feels safe or comfortable with that.
But I think actually it’s not.”The Polish air force inventory still includes just under some 30 Soviet-made MiG-29 combat jets, according to Jane’s World Air Forces.
The country also has U.S. F-16 combat jets in its fleet, made by Lockheed Martin Corp. Poland also has agreed to buy American F-35 combat planes.
