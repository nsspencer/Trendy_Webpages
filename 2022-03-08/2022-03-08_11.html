     Summary: Disney employees furious the company won't denounce Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' billEnlarge this image toggle caption Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP Chris Pizzello/Invision/APDisney employees are showing their outrage over the entertainment company's decision not to denounce Florida's so-called 'Don't Say Gay' bill, which would limit discussion of sexuality and gender in Florida schools.
The Florida Senate passed the bill Tuesday, and it now goes to Gov.
Ben Siemon, an actor and writer whose credits include Disney's DuckTales, posted an impassioned video plea calling for Disney to say the bill is wrong.
Had there been a bill like the one being considered in Florida, Siemon says, "That would've never happened to me.
Siemon implored the company to stop supporting those politicians, ending with the words, "Disney, please say gay."

     ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill passes Florida Senate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeff Greenberg / Contributor/ Getty Images(TALLAHASSEE, Fla.) — The Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by LGBTQ activists, has now been passed by both the Florida Senate and House.
The bill would limit what classrooms can teach about sexual orientation and gender identity.
Ron DeSantis has said he supports the bill, though he hasn’t explicitly said he will sign it if it crosses his desk.
In a recent interview on ABC News’ podcast “Start Here,” Florida state Rep. Joe Harding defended the bill, which he introduced.
“Families are families,” Harding said.

     Despite nationwide outcry, FL Senate pushes through “Don’t Say Gay” bill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HB 1557, the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill, passed in the Senate 22 to 17 on Tuesday, with two Republicans joining Democratic senators voting against the bill.
LGBTQ advocates exhausted every effort to kill the bill, but they couldn’t block it at the legislative level.
Equality Florida, a statewide LGBTQ advocacy group, threatened potential legal challenges in a written statement Tuesday.
“The Department of Education has made clear that all schools receiving federal funding must follow federal civil rights law, including Title IX’s protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
So you say — you can’t say that ‘it’s not’ but the bill sponsor says that ‘it is.

     Florida lawmakers pass 'Don't Say Gay' bill, send to Gov. DeSantis for signature
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: James CallCapital Bureau | USA TODAY NETWORK – FLORIDAFlorida lawmakers on Tuesday passed a bill — dubbed by critics the "Don’t Say Gay" bill — restricting speech in public school classrooms on sexual orientation and gender identity, sparked by one lawmaker's concern that children were being "trendy" in coming out as gay.
The bill, however, doesn't provide a bright line between "classroom instruction" and "classroom discussion," which the bill's supporters say it won't prevent.
Five things to know:Learn more about Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' gender discussions at schools billCritics continue to fear the measure will stigmatize LGBTQ youth and banish discussions of their lives and families from the public school classroom.
DeSantis, who has positioned himself as a culture warrior for conservatives amid a 2022 reelection campaign and a possible 2024 presidential bid, has said publicly he didn't push for the legislation but still has defended it, recently berating a reporter for using the “Don’t Say Gay” nickname.
“Does it say that in the bill?” DeSantis said Monday when asked about it by local affiliate WFLA.

     ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill: Florida Senate passes controversial LGBTQ school measure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The measure, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by its opponents, was passed by the state House last month and now heads to Republican Gov.
“This is going to endanger the safety of our LGBTQ students and adolescents,” Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Democrat, said during Tuesday’s debate.
Supporters of the bill say it’s about allowing parents to have control over their children’s education, while opponents say it unfairly targets the LGBTQ community.
Last week, students across Florida staged school walkouts in protest against the bill, which they decried as the state’s latest measure to limit the rights of LGBTQ students.
We stand with our LGBTQ+ students in Florida and across the country, and urge Florida leaders to make sure all their students are protected and supported."

     Tension, condemnations rise as “Don’t say Gay” bill nears vote in Florida Senate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christina Pushaw tweeted Friday in support of the bill that would restrict certain conversations on LGBTQ issues in Florida’s public school classrooms.
The bill is officially called “Parental Rights in Education,” but opponents have been referring to it as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill due to its potential chilling effect in Florida classrooms regarding LGBTQ issues and students.
The LGBTQ community, for example, is worried that students could be “outed” to an unsupportive family, potentially putting LGBTQ students in harm’s way.
HB 1557 was dubbed a “hateful bill” by President Joe Biden on Twitter in early February.
Some senators have offered amendments addressing concerns about the bill, and the Senate will have the opportunity to approve or dismiss those changes.
