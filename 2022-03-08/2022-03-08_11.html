    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Breeze Airways, which currently has four existing destinations, will now fly nonstop from Richmond to 10 cities.
“We’ve had 50,000 people come through this airport on Breeze Airways,” said Wayne Hazzard, Chairman of the Capital Region Airport Commission.
However, the announcement comes as fuel prices continue to increase in light of the war in Ukraine and as the COVID-19 surge dwindles.
Breeze’s Found and CEO David Neeleman said some of the routes would address the rise in jet fuel prices by using a new A220 aircraft.
“The Airbus aircraft embodies the Breeze ideal of merging kindness with technology, pairing unrivaled passenger comfort with eco-friend efficiency.
