     Elusive Wolverine Filmed in Yellowstone Park in Incredibly Rare Footage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the rarest animals in Yellowstone has been captured on camera by visitors to the national park.
The video, posted by Carl Kemp to YouTube, shows a wolverine walking across a tarmac road through the park, which is surrounded by snow-covered hills and trees.
The footage offers a rare glimpse of the wolverine, which is an extremely uncommon sight in Yellowstone.
The latest population estimate of wolverines in Yellowstone took place between 2006 and 2009.
The video showed the wolverine scampering along the road before walking up a snow-covered hill and into a bank of trees as onlookers express their amazement at the encounter.

     20th Century Fox Wanted Major Wolverine Change, Says ‘X-Men’ Writer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: X-Men writer David Hayter has revealed that 20th Century Fox demanded a major change for Wolverine.
20th Century Fox’s cinematic gamble clearly worked as the now maligned Bryan Singer launched a billion-dollar franchise.
The most notable decision made by the creative execs was roping in Australian actor Hugh Jackman to portray Wolverine.
However, there was one major change that 20th Century wanted for the X-Men which writer David Hayter (who also voiced Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid games) didn’t budge on.
Speaking with Inverse, David Hayter recounted how the studio wanted to change the X-Men character’s Canadian heritage.

     Classic Wolverine Writer Explains the Real Reason the X-Man Is So Popular
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While many X-Men fans love Wolverine for his short temper and brutal fighting style, classic Wolverine writer Larry Hama thinks there's another important and oftentimes overlooked aspect to the character that makes him so popular.
"I got to return to Wolverine recently for Wolverine: Patch and it was great," he said.

See, I'm not a story guy, I'm a character guy.
Wolverine: Patch takes place before Hama's original run on Wolverine and sees the character make a different name for himself, "Patch," while staying on the island of Madripoor.

     Yellowstone wolverine sighting astounds tourists. How common are they in Idaho?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They’re also rarely spotted in Idaho despite having a widespread year-round range, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
Still, according to Fish and Game observation reports, at least one Ada County wolverine sighting has proved accurate.
Fish and Game records all reported wolverine sightings on its website.
So far this year, only two people have reported possible wolverine sightings (neither claim has been reviewed yet, according to the agency’s website).
Phillips said Idaho considers wolverines a population of concern because of the small number of animals in Idaho and their need for specialized environments, including deep snow.
