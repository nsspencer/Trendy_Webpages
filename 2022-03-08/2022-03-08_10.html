     'Don't Say Gay' bill passes Florida Senate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The bill would ban curricula concerning LGBTQ issues in some Florida classrooms.
The Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed the "Don't Say Gay" bill by LGBTQ activists, has now been passed by both the Florida Senate and House.
The bill would limit what classrooms can teach about sexual orientation and gender identity.
Paley added, “We know that LGBTQ youth already face higher risk for bullying, depression, and suicide – and this bill will only add to the stigma that fuels these disparities."
In a recent interview on ABC News' podcast "Start Here," Republican Florida state Rep. Joe Harding defended the bill, which he introduced.

     Despite nationwide outcry, FL Senate pushes through “Don’t Say Gay” bill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HB 1557, the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill, passed in the Senate 22 to 17 on Tuesday, with two Republicans joining Democratic senators voting against the bill.
LGBTQ advocates exhausted every effort to kill the bill, but they couldn’t block it at the legislative level.
Equality Florida, a statewide LGBTQ advocacy group, threatened potential legal challenges in a written statement Tuesday.
“The Department of Education has made clear that all schools receiving federal funding must follow federal civil rights law, including Title IX’s protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
So you say — you can’t say that ‘it’s not’ but the bill sponsor says that ‘it is.

     Fla. Senate Approves ‘Don’t Say Gay’ Bill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Florida Senate, rebuffing protests from students and LGBTQ activists over the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, gave final approve to the legislation on Tuesday, sending the measure to the desk of the Gov.
The vote on the measure, titled HB 1557, was 22-17 in the Republican-controlled Senate and largely along political lines.
Yesterday while walking by…I asked a couple members from the other side of the aisle: ‘Are you really okay with this bill?’” Pizzo said.
“We have failed as a legislature if hundreds of kids stand outside screaming for their rights, and you can’t explain to fifth graders and sixth graders and eighth graders, simple definitions of your own bill,” Pizzo said.
Key portions of the “Don’t Say Gay” bill reveal the potential penalty for the slightest hint of talk about LGBTQ+ kids and families in schools.

     ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill: Florida Senate passes controversial LGBTQ school measure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The measure, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by its opponents, was passed by the state House last month and now heads to Republican Gov.
“This is going to endanger the safety of our LGBTQ students and adolescents,” Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Democrat, said during Tuesday’s debate.
Supporters of the bill say it’s about allowing parents to have control over their children’s education, while opponents say it unfairly targets the LGBTQ community.
Last week, students across Florida staged school walkouts in protest against the bill, which they decried as the state’s latest measure to limit the rights of LGBTQ students.
We stand with our LGBTQ+ students in Florida and across the country, and urge Florida leaders to make sure all their students are protected and supported."

     Tension, condemnations rise as “Don’t say Gay” bill nears vote in Florida Senate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christina Pushaw tweeted Friday in support of the bill that would restrict certain conversations on LGBTQ issues in Florida’s public school classrooms.
The bill is officially called “Parental Rights in Education,” but opponents have been referring to it as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill due to its potential chilling effect in Florida classrooms regarding LGBTQ issues and students.
The LGBTQ community, for example, is worried that students could be “outed” to an unsupportive family, potentially putting LGBTQ students in harm’s way.
HB 1557 was dubbed a “hateful bill” by President Joe Biden on Twitter in early February.
Some senators have offered amendments addressing concerns about the bill, and the Senate will have the opportunity to approve or dismiss those changes.
