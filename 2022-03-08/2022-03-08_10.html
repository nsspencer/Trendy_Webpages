     James Harden Puts in Extra Work Following Sixers' Win Over Bulls
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And instead of playing in the 2022 NBA All-Star game, Harden continued to rest.
When the Sixers returned to the court following the break, Harden finally made his debut against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
On Monday night, Harden turned in a 38-minute shift in Philadelphia’s dominant win over the Bulls.
Despite checking in for nearly 40 minutes on Monday night — Harden felt he needed to put some extra work in.
I’m trying to get some extra conditioning and extra work in.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA–The two best big men, and quite possibly two best players in the league, are Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid and Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic.
The two of them finished 1 and 2 in the MVP race in 2021, Jokic won with Embiid finishing 2nd, and the two of them have been even better in 2021-22.
He and Embiid are the top MVP candidates again in 2022 and Embiid gave his respect to Jokic.
I saw what he was able to do last night (Sunday), I was watching the game actually, I’m always watching every game, but he’s a monster.
This came on the same night where Embiid had 43 points and 14 rebounds in a win over the Chicago Bulls.

     Report: Nets' Ben Simmons expected to file grievance against Sixers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is a great deal of anticipation before Thursday’s huge matchup between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Brooklyn Nets.
For Philadelphia fans, this will be their first time seeing Simmons in the building since Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.
Simmons understands the reception he is expected to receive from Sixers fans, and he just might use that to file a grievance against Philadelphia in an attempt to regain the money the Sixers fined him.
Earlier in the season, Simmons’ agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, said the Sixers were making things worse for his client in terms of his mental health.
The fines the Sixers put on Simmons were based on disagreements between the two sides.

     Doc Rivers Believes Sixers Should Pay Tribute to Ben Simmons on Thursday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not only are the Nets one of Philadelphia’s division rivals, but they are the team that now employs Philadelphia’s former first pick, Ben Simmons.
Typically, NBA teams pay respects to their former players by announcing their return or playing a tribute video during a timeout.
Since Simmons spent five years in Philadelphia, many are curious as to whether the Sixers will pay tribute to Simmons or not.
A Sixers official couldn’t confirm whether the team would have a tribute video for Simmons on Thursday or not -- but Sixers head coach Doc Rivers believes the All-Star deserves one.
If the star guard didn’t go out on a bad note, having a tribute for Simmons would be a no-brainer.

     Summary: Harden has made everybody around him better and that includes second-year guard Tyrese Maxey who has continued to take big steps forward as a 21-year old kid.
He continues to show that he has been able to grow as a player and Bulls coach Billy Donovan was impressed with Maxey’s growth even before the game started.
“He’s gotten a lot better,” Donovan said of Maxey before the game.
He has been able to make a big jump in his second season as he has become a huge part of this Philadelphia team.
They’ve obviously put a lot of work in and he’s made a huge jump.”This post originally appeared on Sixers Wire!

“It’s just a regular matchup.
It’s a regular matchup for me, regular season game.
There is going to be no shortage of drama, but Embiid, Harden, and the rest of the Sixers appear unfazed by the storylines surrounding the game.

     Summary: Thursday evening's Sixers-Nets meeting is one of the most anticipated games in South Philly in recent memory, a spectacle with battles within battles within battles.
There's Kevin Durant vs. Joel Embiid, James Harden vs. his former teammates, and Ben Simmons vs. just about everybody.
The suggestion has been floated in league circles that Simmons showing up for Thursday's game is merely setting the stage for Simmons and Klutch Sports' argument when the grievance is filed.
The mental health claim will become a central component of the grievance for more reasons than that.
Teammates had organized a potential trip out to California to visit Simmons prior to Simmons shutting that down.

     Summary: We're just two days out from a date Sixers fans have had circled on their calendars for weeks, and a moment those same fans have been thinking about for the better part of the year.
It's time for Ben Simmons to return to the Wells Fargo Center, in front of fans, and face the music.
Simmons needs to face Sixers fans sooner rather than later, even if he's not playing.
But Thursday night will be the biggest outpouring of frustration at the former Sixers star, and it seems Simmons wants to get it over with.
But to most Sixers fans, it feels like Simmons came up small in the playoffs and then quit on the organization when he took the brunt of the blame.

     Summary: The Sixers have been playing on another level since James Harden arrived, and after Monday night's win over Chicago, they don't seem to be showing any signs of slowing down.
In the power rankings, the Sixers have mostly stayed put across most outlets in the past week, but that definitely isn't a bad thing.
Although the Sixers rank high for most, some wonder how the Sixers will hold up once the competition starts getting tougher.
From Zach Harper at The Athletic:Obviously, a lot of this has changed dramatically with the addition of James Harden.
Maxey has struggled for the Sixers, getting just a point per shot and not really scoring unless he gets to the free-throw line.
