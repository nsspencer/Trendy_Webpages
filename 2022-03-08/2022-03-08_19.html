     Jackson State Tigers football coach Deion Sanders says he had two toes amputated after medical setback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deion Sanders had two toes on his left foot amputated because of blood clots stemming from a previous surgery.
The Jackson State coach and NFL Hall of Famer revealed the severity of his foot injury in an episode of his "Coach Prime" documentary series that will air Tuesday night on Barstool Sports.
"They were talking about the amputation of toes," Sanders said.
He also had compartment syndrome, which meant his leg swelled, and doctors had to flay open his leg to drain fluid.
Sanders later had his left foot's big toe and second toe amputated.
