     Apple introduces a brand new Mac, the Mac Studio – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And the company announced a brand new desktop computer called the Mac Studio.
The M1 Ultra is an even faster variant of the M1 chip — it’s more powerful than the M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max and M1 Ultra.
The Mac Studio comes with an M1 Max or an M1 Ultra system on a chip, and Apple shared some performance charts for the Mac Studio with the M1 Ultra.
If you max out the existing Mac Pro, the M1 Ultra is supposed to be 80% faster than the fastest Mac Pro.
The Mac Studio with an M1 Ultra chip, 64GB of unified memory and 1TB of storage costs $3,999.
