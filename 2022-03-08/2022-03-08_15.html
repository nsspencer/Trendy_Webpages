     Ana De Armas' Intimate Movie Scenes With Ben Affleck Have Bennifer Fans Worried
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ana De Armas' Intimate Movie Scenes With Ben Affleck Have Bennifer Fans Worried"Deep Water," the highly-anticipated adaptation of the hit Patricia Highsmith novel of the same name, is finally due for release in March 2022.
The Hulu original movie, which was directed by Adrian Lyne, of "Fatal Attraction" fame, has gradually increased in notoriety for several reasons.
For another, Ana de Armas and Ben Affleck, who play the leads, fell in love on set and went on to date for a short while afterwards, only for Affleck to ultimately get back together with ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez.
Affleck plays Vic, the unhappy husband of philandering Melinda (de Armas), who's driven to breaking point by his wife's shocking behavior.
In May 2021, Affleck rekindled his long-dormant relationship with Lopez and the beloved celebrity couple has been going strong ever since.
