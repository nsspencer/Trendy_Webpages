    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukraine’s Zelensky expressed his frustration Wednesday after the United States all but rejected an offer from Poland to provide its MiG-29 fighter jets for use by Ukrainian pilots.
Ukraine has requested the fighter jets, saying its pilots can fly them and that they could help it defend itself against Russian planes.
U.S. and Western officials said they were not consulted before Poland made the public statement.
The Pentagon called the offer “untenable” and said that the idea of fighter jets departing from a U.S. air base in Germany bound for Ukraine would raise “serious concerns” for the NATO alliance.
We don’t have time for all this media, for all these signals.”“This isn’t ping-pong — it’s people’s lives,” implored the Ukrainian leader.

     ‘Smells of genocide’: How Putin justifies Russia’s war in Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Experts analyse the Russian president’s claims of ‘genocide’ as justification for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has been telling Russians that the objective of his war in Ukraine is the “demilitarisation and denazification” of the Ukrainian government.
Other attacks, depending on the context, could constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide,” Russian human rights lawyer Nataliya Sekretareva told Al Jazeera.
If Russia has proof of genocide taking place, why did it not formally bring its claims before the UN?
“It claims that Ukrainians are attacking ethnic Russians and Russian speakers who Russia claims to be obliged to protect,” he said.
