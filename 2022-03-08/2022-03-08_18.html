     Summary: UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace arrives to attend the government weekly cabinet meeting at Downing Street on March 8 in London, England.
(Leon Neal/Getty Images)Britain is increasing its supply of weapons systems to Ukraine in “response to further acts of aggression by Russia,” UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace said Wednesday.
Britain has now supplied 3,615 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, and will also shortly be supplying a small consignment of Javelin anti-tank missiles, he told lawmakers in parliament.
Wallace said the “initial supply was to be 2,000 New Light anti-tank weapons, small arms and ammunition,” but that has been increased and the UK will continue to deliver more.
President Putin's arrogant assumption that he would be welcomed as the Liberator has deservedly crumbled as far as his troops morale.”

     Summary: Nuclear power plant concernsUkrainian officials expressed alarm on Wednesday about a loss of power at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.
Reserve diesel generators were able to power the plant for 48 hours, Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.
The Russian military entered the site on Feb. 24 and since then, the same shift has been on duty, the IAEA has said.
Officials also raised concerns about Europe’s largest nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia, where Russian forces took control last week.
The city has been without electricity, heat, water or food for many days and Ukrainian officials have called the situation there catastrophic.

     Russia-Ukraine live updates Chernobyl in ‘extremely dangerous’ situation; Ukraine evacuation attempts resume

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meanwhile, Russia promised a new cease-fire to allow the evacuation of civilians from “a number of cities in Ukraine,” including Kyiv and Mariupol, its state media reported, citing Russian government sources.
It’s unclear whether Ukraine and Russia have agreed to each other’s routes.
According to the state-owned news agency RIA Novosti, the Russian Defense Ministry on Wednesday claimed Ukraine has approved one of its proposed routes — from the city of Sumy.
Authorities in Moscow have previously proposed evacuating civilians to Russia or its ally, Belarus, which Ukraine has said would be unacceptable.
On Wednesday, separatists in Donetsk said that Kyiv did not agree to proposed evacuation corridors from Mariupol and Volnovkha to Russia or to separatist regions.

     ‘Smells of genocide’: How Putin justifies Russia’s war in Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Experts analyse the Russian president’s claims of ‘genocide’ as justification for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has been telling Russians that the objective of his war in Ukraine is the “demilitarisation and denazification” of the Ukrainian government.
Other attacks, depending on the context, could constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide,” Russian human rights lawyer Natalia Secretareva told Al Jazeera.
If Russia has proof of genocide taking place, why did it not formally bring its claims before the UN?
“It claims that Ukrainians are attacking ethnic Russians and Russian speakers who Russia claims to be obliged to protect,” he said.
