     Russia facing setbacks in Ukraine, US intelligence officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CIA director says Russian President Putin’s assumptions about Ukraine before the invasion turned out to be ‘profoundly flawed’.
Russian forces are facing setbacks in their invasion of Ukraine, US intelligence officials have said, stressing that President Vladimir Putin’s plan to install a puppet government in Kyiv is unlikely to succeed amid fierce Ukrainian resistance.
During a congressional hearing on Tuesday, the heads of United States intelligence agencies told lawmakers that despite the issues with the invasion, Putin is likely to escalate the conflict in the coming weeks.
The Russian president did not anticipate the effects of Western sanctions or the private sector’s pullback from Russia, Haines told legislators.
The war has forced two million people to flee the country and devastated areas across Ukraine with major cities, including the capital Kyiv, facing Russian bombardment and siege.

     Summary: The number of people forced to escape Ukraine has passed a milestone of two million, as the civilian toll of the Russia-Ukraine war mounted along with international efforts to press President Vladimir Putin to halt the Russian offensive.
A Russian military convoy opened fire near a checkpoint in the besieged northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, interrupting evacuations in violation of a brokered cease-fire.
In many cities, Russia continued to obstruct civilians fleeing violence by firing in their vicinity and fighting nearby established humanitarian corridors.

     Summary: The trip comes as the Pentagon on Tuesday dismissed Poland's proposal to transfer its MiG-29 fighter jets to the United States for delivery to Ukraine.
The idea as laid out by Poland was too risky, Kirby said, as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia.
More background: The Defense Department statement was released Tuesday evening after the Polish proposal caught the Biden administration completely off guard, multiple sources told CNN.
US officials have privately weighed sending aircraft to Ukraine but have repeatedly noted the difficult logistical challenges of doing so.
Harris had been expected to discuss the fighter jet issue while in Poland, according to officials.

     Russia-Ukraine war: Biden bans US imports of Russian oil and gas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The United States is banning all imports of oil and gas from Russia, US President Joe Biden has announced, in a move that aims to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.
“We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy.
That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine,” he told reporters.
Oil and gas giant Shell said on Tuesday that it would gradually withdraw from all Russian oil and gas, beginning with an immediate stop to all “spot purchases” of Russian crude oil.
“We will commit profits from the limited, remaining amounts of Russian oil we will process to a dedicated fund.

     Live Updates: Biden Bans Russian Oil Imports and Major U.S. Brands Close Outlets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The talks with Venezuela, which has enormous proven oil reserves, assumed new urgency after President Biden announced Tuesday that the United States would ban Russian oil imports because of the invasion.
But industry experts warned that Venezuelan oil supplies would do little to tame American gas prices and inflation quickly.
Before that ban, Venezuela exported most of its oil to the United States, whose Gulf refineries were built to process the country’s heavy crude.
Their former boss, Nelson Martínez, the head of the state oil company, was detained soon after them and died in custody a year later.
The Trump administration cut off diplomatic relations with Venezuela in 2019, closing the United States Embassy in Caracas and imposing the ban on Venezuelan oil.

     Summary: Biden announces Russian oil import ban and warns gas prices could increase even moreEnlarge this image toggle caption Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on U.S. imports of Russian oil and gas — the latest move to try to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine.
Already, the cost to fuel up has spiked since the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to historic gas prices across the country.
It's going to cost us as well in the United States," Biden said.
But the move to cut off Russian oil reserves has redoubled the administration's push to wind down Western dependence on fossil fuels altogether.
Oil and gas prices have soaredOil prices hit a 14-year high on Monday ahead of the announcement, and U.S. gasoline prices have now hit a record.
