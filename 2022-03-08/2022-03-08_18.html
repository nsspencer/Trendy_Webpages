     Carrie Underwood Flies Solo To 75th ACM Awards As Career Puts Mike Fisher Marriage In Jeopardy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Carrie Underwood stunned on the red carpet at the 75th Academy of Country Music Awards, it was hard not to notice she was missing her eye candy.
The "Before He Cheats" songstress was all smiles ahead of the award show — where she and Jason Aldean won Single of the Year for "If I Didn't Love You" — while showing off her toned legs in a shimmery silver dress and strappy heels.
Posing alone, Underwood kept her long blonde locks down and matched her jaw-dropping number with a sparkling purse.

     Carrie Underwood Has Been 'Busy,' Seemingly Hints At Something In The Works
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Underwood wowed the crowd when she descended from the ceiling during her performance with Aldean, making a Vegas-worthy entrance onstage.
The 57th ACM Awards show comes as Underwood is gearing up for the next leg of REFLECTION: The Las Vegas Residency, and said Vegas has become “my home away from home” when she spoke about the stunning performance at the ACMs: “I feel like I’ve gotten a taste for Vegas showmanship, and it’s just so much fun.
We were trying to think of ways to make this performance fresh and fun… When somebody said, ‘how would she feel about descending from the ceiling,’ I was like, ‘I feel good about that.’ I was excited.
It’s something I’ve never done before, and I’m always up for trying new things (and) adding a bit of danger into performance.”

     Carrie Underwood Might Be Working on New Music: ‘My Fans Know What I Mean When I Say Soon’

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The star also recently launched her Reflection: The Las Vegas Residency, and the next step might be a new batch of music — at least, according to a cryptic teaser she gave backstage at the awards show.
"I mean, I'm always working on something," Underwood said, in response to a question from the press room about whether a new album or tour might be in the offing.
"Obviously we can't spill too many beans right now, but my fans know what I mean when I say ... soon.
Underwood remained tight-lipped on the details of what's ahead, but fans will have plenty of opportunity to see her perform in Vegas in the coming months.
That means plenty of opportunity for Underwood to debut any new songs she's got cooking.
