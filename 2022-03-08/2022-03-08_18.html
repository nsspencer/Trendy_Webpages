     Summary: The number of people forced to escape Ukraine has passed a milestone of two million, as the civilian toll of the Russia-Ukraine war mounted along with international efforts to press President Vladimir Putin to halt the Russian offensive.
A Russian military convoy opened fire near a checkpoint in the besieged northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, interrupting evacuations in violation of a brokered cease-fire.
In many cities, Russia continued to obstruct civilians fleeing violence by firing in their vicinity and fighting nearby established humanitarian corridors.

     Russia facing setbacks in Ukraine, US intelligence officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CIA director says Russian President Putin’s assumptions about Ukraine before the invasion turned out to be ‘profoundly flawed’.
Russian forces are facing setbacks in their invasion of Ukraine, US intelligence officials have said, stressing that President Vladimir Putin’s plan to install a puppet government in Kyiv is unlikely to succeed amid fierce Ukrainian resistance.
During a congressional hearing on Tuesday, the heads of United States intelligence agencies told lawmakers that despite the issues with the invasion, Putin is likely to escalate the conflict in the coming weeks.
The Russian president did not anticipate the effects of Western sanctions or the private sector’s pullback from Russia, Haines told legislators.
The war has forced two million people to flee the country and devastated areas across Ukraine with major cities, including the capital Kyiv, facing Russian bombardment and siege.

     U.S. estimates 2,000 to 4,000 Russian troops killed in Ukraine war
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. assesses with "low confidence" that between 2,000 and 4,000 Russian troops have been killed over the course of Vladimir Putin's 12-day war in Ukraine, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier testified Tuesday.
Why it matters: The estimated number of casualties is "far in excess" of what Russia anticipated or has publicly acknowledged, according to U.S. intelligence officials.
Putin has still not achieved his initial goal — seizing Kyiv within two days — and may turn to more brutal tactics in the coming days and weeks.
What to watch: Despite the setbacks, the U.S. believes Putin is unlikely to be deterred and may escalate his assault on heavily populated civilian areas.
"He's likely to double down and grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties," CIA Director Bill Burns testified, describing Putin as "angry and frustrated."

     Summary: Speaking live with CNN's Jake Tapper, Nuland noted that at this point in the conflict, the purpose of sanctions is to directly impact the Russian president.
The official said that 70% of Russian oil "is now offline" as a result of sanctions and bans like the one that Biden announced today.
"So that is the first purpose is to ensure that over the long-term, the medium-term, ideally over the short-term, that this is a strategic loss for President Putin."
Nuland offered Tapper and his viewers a glimpse into where Russia is currently at in terms of the invasion into Ukraine, a view that doesn't reflect positively on Putin.

     Summary: Biden announces Russian oil import ban and warns gas prices could increase even moreEnlarge this image toggle caption Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on U.S. imports of Russian oil and gas — the latest move to try to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine.
Already, the cost to fuel up has spiked since the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to historic gas prices across the country.
It's going to cost us as well in the United States," Biden said.
But the move to cut off Russian oil reserves has redoubled the administration's push to wind down Western dependence on fossil fuels altogether.
Oil and gas prices have soaredOil prices hit a 14-year high on Monday ahead of the announcement, and U.S. gasoline prices have now hit a record.

     Summary: The United States is banning all imports of oil and gas from Russia, US President Joe Biden has announced, in a move that aims to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.
“We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy.
That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine,” he told reporters.
Oil and gas giant Shell said on Tuesday that it would gradually withdraw from all Russian oil and gas, beginning with an immediate stop to all “spot purchases” of Russian crude oil.
“We will commit profits from the limited, remaining amounts of Russian oil we will process to a dedicated fund.
