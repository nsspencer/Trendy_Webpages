“We want more supply in the world, more oil supply.
We want it from producers that have spare capacity.
They're about 3 to 4 million barrels per day of spare capacity.
Saudi has some of that spare capacity,” Singh said during an appearance on CNN’s "New Day."

     Summary: Meanwhile, Russia promised a new cease-fire to allow the evacuation of civilians from “a number of cities in Ukraine,” including Kyiv and Mariupol, its state media reported, citing Russian government sources.
It’s unclear whether Ukraine and Russia have agreed to each other’s routes.
According to the state-owned news agency RIA Novosti, the Russian Defense Ministry on Wednesday claimed Ukraine has approved one of its proposed routes — from the city of Sumy.
Authorities in Moscow have previously proposed evacuating civilians to Russia or its ally, Belarus, which Ukraine has said would be unacceptable.
On Wednesday, separatists in Donetsk said that Kyiv did not agree to proposed evacuation corridors from Mariupol and Volnovkha to Russia or to separatist regions.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The recent trip by two top US foreign policy officials to Caracas, Venezuela, is a sign of just how much the geopolitical balance could be shifting in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Context: Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world — and historically, much of its crude oil has been exported to US refineries.
Venezuelan oil: Maduro confirmed Venezuela’s intention to increase its crude oil output on Monday, a move that comes as Russia’s oil exports are plummeting due to sanctions over its invasion in Ukraine.
So if the White House needs a short-term solution to lower the price of gasoline, it cannot come from Venezuela.
Later, Jorge Alberto Fernandez, a Cuban-US dual citizen detained in Venezuela since February 2021, was released from prison.

     Summary: In a notice posted Wednesday on its website, the central bank said the restrictions would last through Sept. 9.
Any amount above that level will be given in rubles, based on the market exchange rate on the day of the withdrawal, the central bank said.
Customers withdrawing money from foreign-currency accounts at Russian banks will be given dollars, regardless of which foreign currency the account is denominated in, it said.
The central bank said around 90% of foreign-currency bank accounts in Russia don’t hold more than $10,000, meaning that most bank-account holders won’t be affected by the changes.
The central bank’s new measure follows an order by the Kremlin late last month that forbids Russians from sending money to bank accounts abroad.

     ‘Smells of genocide’: How Putin justifies Russia’s war in Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Experts analyse the Russian president’s claims of ‘genocide’ as justification for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has been telling Russians that the objective of his war in Ukraine is the “demilitarisation and denazification” of the Ukrainian government.
Other attacks, depending on the context, could constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide,” Russian human rights lawyer Natalia Secretareva told Al Jazeera.
If Russia has proof of genocide taking place, why did it not formally bring its claims before the UN?
“It claims that Ukrainians are attacking ethnic Russians and Russian speakers who Russia claims to be obliged to protect,” he said.

     Live Updates: Costs of War Mount for Russia, and for Civilians in Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The disagreement underscored the pressures the United States and its allies are under as they seek to provide military aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia without getting pulled into a wider war.
Ukraine has been pleading for more warplanes, and American officials have raised the possibility that Poland could supply Ukraine with its older Soviet-era fighters in return for U.S. F-16s to make up for the loss.
“Any decisions on delivering offensive weapons have to be taken by the entire NATO and on a unanimous basis,” he said.
Ukraine’s president, Volodomyr Zelensky, has pleaded with the NATO allies to establish a no-fly zone over the country, but so far the alliance has rejected the proposal because it would almost certainly lead to a wider war between the allies and Russia.
More than 10,000 American soldiers are now stationed there as part Washington’s attempt to shore up the alliance’s eastern flank.
