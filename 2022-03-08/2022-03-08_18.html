     Summary: Enrique Tarrio, who led the Proud Boys, is arrested over the U.S. Capitol attackEnlarge this image toggle caption John Rudoff/AFP via Getty Images John Rudoff/AFP via Getty ImagesEnrique Tarrio, who was the chairman of the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys, was arrested and charged with conspiracy for his alleged role in planning the Jan. 6 attack, the Justice Department announced on Tuesday.
As the leader and creator of a special chapter of the Proud Boys known as the Ministry of Self Defense, the 38-year-old "led the advance planning and remained in contact with other members of the Proud Boys during their breach of the Capitol," according to prosecutors.
The Justice Department also said he claimed credit for the attack on social media and in an encrypted chat room during and after the attack.
Tarrio was arrested in Miami and is scheduled to make his initial court appearance in the Southern District of Florida.
More recently, prosecutors have filed charges against leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers — extremist groups that officials have long said were involved in the attack.

     Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio charged with conspiracy in Jan. 6 US Capitol insurrection
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tarrio, who made an initial court appearance Tuesday afternoon, was named in a superseding indictment that includes five previously charged Proud Boys defendants.
Tarrio was added as a defendant in an existing conspiracy case against five other members of the Proud Boys who allegedly attacked the Capitol that day.
Tarrio was the national leader of the Proud Boys in the months leading up to the Jan. 6 attack.
Tarrio joins 42 other Proud Boys who have been charged with crimes related to the Jan. 6 insurrection.
A public defender was appointed to represent him for a Friday detention hearing after the Proud Boys leader told a judge that he was largely indigent with "absolutely" no savings.

     Leader of Proud Boys Indicted in Federal Court for Conspiracy and Other Offenses Related to U.S. Capitol Breach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tarrio, 38, of Miami, Florida, was arrested in Miami and is to make his initial appearance today in the Southern District of Florida.
He was named in a superseding indictment returned Monday in the District of Columbia that also includes five previously charged defendants.
Although Tarrio is not accused of physically taking part in the breach of the Capitol, the indictment alleges that he led the advance planning and remained in contact with other members of the Proud Boys during their breach of the Capitol.
As a condition of his release, he was ordered by the Court to stay out of Washington.
An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

     Enrique Tarrio Gets His Chance to Fit In or Fuck Off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Enrique Tarrio was finally indicted in the Proud Boy conspiracy.
Effectively, this indictment adds Tarrio and Dominic Pezzola to the Leader conspiracy.
Among the new lines in the indictment is one describing Tarrio trying to impose discipline.
On December 27, 2020, TARRIO created another encrypted messaging group to recruit potential members of the MOSD (the “MOSD Prospect Group”).
Between December 30 and December 31, 2020, TARRIO communicated multiple times with an individual whose identity is known to the grand jury.

     Longtime Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio charged with conspiracy in Jan. 6 attack on Capitol
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prosecutors say Tarrio conspired with other Proud Boys to obstruct an official proceeding.
Tarrio’s indictment, unsealed Tuesday, accuses him of conspiring with other senior Proud Boys leaders, including Ethan Nordean and Joe Biggs, both of whom were already charged in connection with Jan. 6.
The new indictment also charges that Dominic Pezzola, 44, of Rochester, N.Y. was part of the alleged Proud Boys conspiracy.
Tarrio has described his contacts with Lamond as professional, saying the Proud Boys would give him or other police officials advance notice when the Proud Boys planned to rally or march in the District.
After one violent night of demonstrations, however, police accused the Proud Boys of roaming the city looking for and instigating fights, targeting people they identified as antifa, or antifascists.

     Proud Boys Leader Enrique Tarrio Has Been Charged With Conspiracy In The Jan. 6 Insurrection
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, the former national leader of the Proud Boys far-right extremist group, has been charged with conspiracy in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection, the US attorney’s office in Washington announced on Tuesday.
Tarrio’s codefendants include five men with various ties to the Proud Boys who had already been charged in connection with the insurrection.
Although Tarrio is now identified as the former leader of the group, on Jan. 6, 2021, he was still the national chairman.
In the latest indictment, prosecutors described how he’d posted messages that supported the lie pushed by Trump and other supporters that the election had been stolen.
On Nov. 16, 2020, he’d posed: “If Biden steals this election, [the Proud Boys] will be political prisoners.
