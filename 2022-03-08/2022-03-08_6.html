     Russell Westbrook hits back after wife receives ‘death wishes’ as Lakers struggle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nine-time NBA All-Star Russell Westbrook has spoken out after his wife, Nina, said she has received “death wishes” as the Los Angeles Lakers’ struggles continue.
The 33-year-old Westbrook, who joined his hometown Lakers in August, has become a focal point for fans’ ire as the 2020 NBA champions struggle to make the playoffs this season.
“I 100% stand behind my wife and how she’s feeling,” Westbrook said after the Lakers lost to the San Antonio Spurs on Monday, their eighth defeat in 10 games.
The 2017 NBA MVP said the insults meant his family no longer wanted to attend Lakers games in person.
If the season ended today, the Lakers would be forced into a play-in tournament to qualify for the first-round of the playoffs.

     Russell Westbrook Speaks Out About Harassment His Family Has Faced
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After his wife took to social media to detail the criticism and “death wishes” that she has received, Russell Westbrook used his postgame press conference Monday to expand upon the harassment that he and his family have faced in his first season with the Lakers.
Westbrook has been the target of derision in Los Angeles amid the team’s struggles this year.
While that criticism normally doesn’t affect him, the 14-year veteran said that he and his wife, Nina, are speaking out about the vitriol they’ve received to defend the honor of the “Westbrook” family name and to protect their children.
He tells everybody and walks around and says, ‘I’m Westbrook.’ … And I kind of sat there in shock, and it hit me, like, ‘Damn.
And it’s gotten so bad where my family don’t even want to go to home games, to any game … and it’s just super unfortunate, man.
