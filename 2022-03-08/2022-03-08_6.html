     NFL suspends Atlanta Falcons WR Calvin Ridley indefinitely for betting on games during 2021 season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced Monday in a news release that Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley has been suspended for the 2022 NFL season for betting on games.
The release stated that the 27-year-old Ridley bet on games during the 2021 season.
Ridley appeared in five games last season, before stepping away from football in November to address his mental health.
The Atlanta Falcons said in a statement: “We were first made aware of the league’s investigation on Feb. 9.
We are moving forward in the 2022 season with the decision that was made.

     A One-Year Suspension for Calvin Ridley Is Absurd
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I fully understand Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley should not have bet on NFL games.
I fully support the NFL punishing Ridley.
However, a one-year suspension, which Ridley cannot even appeal until Feb. 15, 2023, is over the top.
Here’s where common sense comes in: You know why a player betting on his own team is considered “bad”?
Calvin Ridley has an $11 million contract with the Falcons.

     Summary: The NFL’s franchise tag window was open for the past 10 days, but it has now closed.
TE David Njoku, Cleveland Browns: The Browns were the first team to officially announce using the franchise tag this offseason.
The two sides were actually working on a contract extension, but no agreement was reached before the closing of the franchise tag window.
TE Dalton Schultz, Dallas Cowboys: Despite the Cowboys being in a dire salary cap situation, they have decided to retain their number one tight end via the franchise tag.
OT Cam Robinson, Jacksonville Jaguars: After already placing the franchise tag on Robinson last offseason, the Jaguars used it again this year — for good reason.

     Summary: Adam Schefter details the trade that will send Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson to the Broncos for a plethora of picks and players.
Denver general manager George Paton initiated trade talks with Seattle for Wilson at least two weeks ago, per sources.
But in recent days, as trade talks with Seattle heated up, it became clear that Wilson was the Broncos' Plan A.
The Broncos' odds to win the Super Bowl improved from 25-1 to 12-1 Tuesday at Caesars Sportsbook.
The Seahawks, meanwhile, saw their odds to win the Super Bowl fall from 40-1 to 75-1 at Caesars.

     Summary: The league slammed Ridley in both word and deed, and then, of course, it patted itself on the back for stating the obvious: Gambling has no place in professional sports.
The National Football League acted quickly, decisively, and forcefully in lowering the boom on Calvin Ridley.
AdvertisementExcept, of course, for the fact that gambling has invaded every corner of professional sports, and nowhere as insidiously as in the NFL.
Of course Calvin Ridley should never have bet on football games, and absolutely he must pay a price, a hefty one.
Because there are going to be plenty more lambs to sacrifice at the altar of the mighty NFL.
