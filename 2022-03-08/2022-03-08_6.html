     'The Thing About Pam' dresses up Renée Zellweger for an odd 'Dateline' drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Drama meets "Dateline" in "The Thing About Pam," an NBC series that seeks to turn one of the newsmagazine's salacious stories into a limited series, complete with ghoulish narration by reporter Keith Morrison.
Featuring Renée Zellweger tromping around under the weight of prosthetic makeup, it's a true-crime experiment that clearly wants to be the next "Fargo" and doesn't get there.
But the key player in the drama turns out to be Pam Hupp (Zellweger), a friend of the dead woman who happened to be the last person to see her alive.
Pam seems a little too eager to point fingers at Russ, telling detectives working the case that he was "not nice verbally to her.
"Dateline" viewers certainly know the type, which explains in part why the prosecutor (Judy Greer) immediately focuses on the victim's husband.

     Renée Zellweger Makes The Thing About Pam Inexplicable
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Is The Thing About Pam meant to be a dark comedy about Pam Hupp’s escalating lies or a serious drama about how she destroyed a family?
Zellweger’s performance makes it hard to say.
Photo: Skip Bolen/NBC“What is Renée Zellweger doing?”That is an actual line from my notes on The Thing About Pam, the NBC miniseries premiering tonight about the 2011 murder of Betsy Faria that the network’s long-running newsmagazine Dateline has covered for years.
The two-time Oscar winner stars as Pam Hupp, a Missouri woman currently serving a life sentence for one murder, awaiting trial in another, and suspected in one more.
But The Thing About Pam isn’t a documentary because that approach has already been done for this story by NBC itself in a podcast of the same name and five Dateline episodes.
