     NFL suspends Atlanta Falcons WR Calvin Ridley indefinitely for betting on games during 2021 season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced Monday in a news release that Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley has been suspended for the 2022 NFL season for betting on games.
The release stated that the 27-year-old Ridley bet on games during the 2021 season.
Ridley appeared in five games last season, before stepping away from football in November to address his mental health.
The Atlanta Falcons said in a statement: “We were first made aware of the league’s investigation on Feb. 9.
We are moving forward in the 2022 season with the decision that was made.

     Summary: The Packers' latest offseason dance with Aaron Rodgers is finished, and it might have been their last.
Green Bay is putting its money where its mouth is, agreeing with the 38-year-old Rodgers on a four-year extension worth $200 million, including $153 million in guaranteed money, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Tuesday.
The deal makes Rodgers the highest-paid player in NFL history on an annual basis while also reducing his salary-cap number for 2022.
With Rodgers' new, lower cap number now factored in, Green Bay can place the franchise tag on Adams before Tuesday's 4 p.m.
Pat McAfee of "The Pat McAfee Show" first reported the news of Rodgers' deal.

     Summary: I fully understand Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley should not have bet on NFL games.
I fully support the NFL punishing Ridley.
However, a one-year suspension, which Ridley cannot even appeal until Feb. 15, 2023, is over the top.
Here’s where common sense comes in: You know why a player betting on his own team is considered “bad”?
Calvin Ridley has an $11 million contract with the Falcons.

The National Football League acted quickly, decisively, and forcefully in lowering the boom on Calvin Ridley.
AdvertisementExcept, of course, for the fact that gambling has invaded every corner of professional sports, and nowhere as insidiously as in the NFL.
Of course Calvin Ridley should never have bet on football games, and absolutely he must pay a price, a hefty one.
Because there are going to be plenty more lambs to sacrifice at the altar of the mighty NFL.
