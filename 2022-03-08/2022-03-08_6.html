     'The Thing About Pam' review: Renée Zellweger headlines an odd 'Dateline' drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Drama meets “Dateline” in “The Thing About Pam,” an NBC series that seeks to turn one of the newsmagazine’s salacious stories into a limited series, complete with ghoulish narration by reporter Keith Morrison.
Featuring Renée Zellweger tromping around under the weight of prosthetic makeup, it’s a true-crime experiment that clearly wants to be the next “Fargo” and doesn’t get there.
“The Thing About Pam” has already exhibited commercial potential, following its coverage on “Dateline” with Morrison’s eponymous podcast, downloaded more than 20 million times, according to NBC.
And the main thing about “Pam” in this guise, frankly, is that it’s not all that good.
“The Thing About Pam” premieres March 8 at 10 p.m.

     The Thing About Pam review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The phrase “Truth is stranger than fiction” was made for a true-crime story like the one at the core of The Thing About Pam.
Loudly touted as Oscar winner Renée Zellweger’s broadcast TV debut, The Thing About Pam does an impressive job of translating an addictive tale to the small screen.

But the series based on the crime are called The Thing About Pam, so there’s early indication that Russ might not be the killer.
Like the podcast, The Thing About Pam is narrated by Dateline correspondent Keith Morrison, which adds a strange but compelling folksy flavor to an increasingly disturbing story.

     Truth may be stranger than the ‘The Thing About Pam’ TV series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: – Pam Hupp sits in a state prison in northern Missouri serving a life sentence for murder; she’ll eventually face trial for another killing.
Beginning March 8, NBC will air the six-part series “The Truth About Pam” starring two-time Academy Award-winner Renée Zellweger as Hupp.
He was convicted in 2013 for Betsy’s murder after a Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office investigation used Hupp as a star witness.
Pam Hupp led away by police after being arrested for the muder of Louis Gumpenberger.
Five years after being exonerated, Russ Faria settled a $2 million lawsuit against Lincoln County for his wrongful prosecution.

     Renée Zellweger Makes The Thing About Pam Inexplicable
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Is The Thing About Pam meant to be a dark comedy about Pam Hupp’s escalating lies or a serious drama about how she destroyed a family?
Zellweger’s performance makes it hard to say.
Photo: Skip Bolen/NBC“What is Renée Zellweger doing?”That is an actual line from my notes on The Thing About Pam, the NBC miniseries premiering tonight about the 2011 murder of Betsy Faria that the network’s long-running newsmagazine Dateline has covered for years.
The two-time Oscar winner stars as Pam Hupp, a Missouri woman currently serving a life sentence for one murder, awaiting trial in another, and suspected in one more.
But The Thing About Pam isn’t a documentary because that approach has already been done for this story by NBC itself in a podcast of the same name and five Dateline episodes.
