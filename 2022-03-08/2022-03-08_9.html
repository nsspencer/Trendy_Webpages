    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets crushed the Charlotte Hornets 132-121 in North Carolina on Tuesday evening, and Kyrie Irving exploded for 50 points in the win.
After the game, he spoke to Michael Grady of the YES Network, and a clip of him speaking can be seen embedded below from their Twitter account.
"You just wanna really put your stamp on a game early and then be able to play the game the right way," Irving said to Grady.
The Nets snapped a four-game losing streak, and are now 33-33 on the season in 66 games, which has them as the ninth seed in the Eastern Conference.
At one point earlier this season, they had been the top seed in the conference.

     Summary: CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and Steve Nash all downplayed facing James Harden on Thursday for the first time since the latter was traded to Philadelphia.
“If that’s what James wanted then I respect his decision.
That’s just what it is,” said Irving, who scored 50 points in the Nets’ 132-121 win over the Hornets on Tuesday night.
Wish things could have been communicated better for all of us as men; but hey, no hard feelings here with me or anything else.”Rookie Cam Thomas (back) made a one-minute cameo in Tuesday’s win.
“So I don’t know if that’s flying on all cylinders, but safe to return and available.”

"It felt like a must-win night," Irving said.
But Irving, as he'd done throughout the second half, thwarted the rally by knocking down a jumper.
... Those were really big shots he made in the second half, but overall he’s just an incredible player, shot maker."
TIP INS: Nets — Durant was assessed a technical foul in the third quarter for pushing Rozier while trying to free himself up for an inbounds pass.

     Summary: This is what happens when Irving, fresh off a subjectively average game in the Nets’ loss in Boston – a game he conceded got the best of him emotionally – plays like the star he’s proven to be.
The Nets’ superstar guard scored 50 points on just 15-of-19 shooting from the field in a 132-121 win in Charlotte.
He became just the third player in NBA history to score 50 points on fewer than 20 field goal attempts and just the fifth player in league history to score 50 points on 75% shooting or better from the field.

Irving needed just 19 shots to get there, making it the most efficient 50-point game by far of his career.
"I've been saying it -- it's pure, everything he does is pure," Durant said of Irving's performance.
He led us all night, hit big shots when he needed to, and it was just an incredible, incredible performance.
