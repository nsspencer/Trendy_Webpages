     Biden, White House will use executive order to add oversight to cryptocurrency: reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is expected to assert some federal control over cryptocurrencies, injecting federal oversight into a monetary Wild West.
Biden will issue an executive order this week that directs federal agencies to address Bitcoin and other digital assets, according to reports from Politico and the Associated Press.
Two people familiar with the process said the executive order on cryptocurrency was expected to be issued this week, and it had been in the works long before the war.
In January, the Federal Reserve announced it would seek public comment on whether to issue a fully digital U.S. dollar.
And last month, the Justice Department announced its first director of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, Eun Young Choi, who will be charged with prosecuting criminal cases related to the use of cryptocurrency and digital assets.

     Biden Expected to Issue Executive Order on Cryptocurrency as a Step Toward Regulation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order on cryptocurrency this week that will mark the first step toward regulating how digital currency is traded.
Two people familiar with the process said the executive order on cryptocurrency was expected to be issued this week and it had been in the works long before the war.
The order is expected to describe what government agencies, including the Treasury Department, need to do to develop policies and regulations on digital currencies.
Implicit in the order will be that cryptocurrency will remain a part of the U.S. economy for years to come.
While U.S. officials have played down the significance of cryptocurrency to Russia’s ability to evade sanctions, it remains a concern.

     President Biden to Sign Crypto Executive Order This Week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden is gearing up to sign a much-anticipated executive order on cryptocurrencies later this week, Reuters reports, paving the way for a wave of detailed studies on the future of digital currencies.
Biden is expected to direct multiple agencies to study the viability and risks of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), which might require congressional approval.
China has already begun piloting its own CBDC, the digital yuan, which logged $14 billion in digital transactions at the end of last year.
This is a likely step toward creation of a central bank digital currency," an anonymous source told Reuters.
Despite saying she is undecided on CBDCs, Yellen has previously supported research into CBDCs and highlighted the financial inclusion offered by a digital dollar.

     Biden to sign executive order on regulating, issuing cryptocurrency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The order is likely to be signed Wednesday, according to Reuters, and would be the White House's first step toward regulating cryptocurrency.
ADVERTISEMENTThe order will ask the State Department to make sure that American cryptocurrency laws align with those of U.S. allies, the AP reported.
It will also reportedly task the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which identifies risks to the country's financial stability, to investigate any financial concerns.
The order comes amid concerns over whether Russia could use cryptocurrency to get around the crushing U.S. sanctions issued in response to its invasion of Ukraine.
"I often hear cryptocurrency mentioned and that is a channel to be watched."
