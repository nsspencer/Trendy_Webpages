     Incredibly rare footage of "the unicorn of Yellowstone" (aka a wolverine)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Saturday, a father and daughter touring Yellowstone National Park spotted an exceedingly rare wolverine walking across the highway.
It was trying to get to the other side, of course.
Apparently there are only seven or so wolverines in the entire 3,500 square-mile park.
"It was really magical to see and dad said it was like the unicorn of Yellowstone," said Maya Kemp, age 9.

     Elusive Wolverine Filmed in Yellowstone Park in Incredibly Rare Footage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the rarest animals in Yellowstone has been captured on camera by visitors to the national park.
The video, posted by Carl Kemp to YouTube, shows a wolverine walking across a tarmac road through the park, which is surrounded by snow-covered hills and trees.
The footage offers a rare glimpse of the wolverine, which is an extremely uncommon sight in Yellowstone.
The latest population estimate of wolverines in Yellowstone took place between 2006 and 2009.
The video showed the wolverine scampering along the road before walking up a snow-covered hill and into a bank of trees as onlookers express their amazement at the encounter.

Wolverines are so rare, the National Park Service only documented seven of the animals in eastern Yellowstone and adjoining national forests from 2006-2009.

     20th Century Fox Wanted Major Wolverine Change, Says ‘X-Men’ Writer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: X-Men writer David Hayter has revealed that 20th Century Fox demanded a major change for Wolverine.
20th Century Fox’s cinematic gamble clearly worked as the now maligned Bryan Singer launched a billion-dollar franchise.
The most notable decision made by the creative execs was roping in Australian actor Hugh Jackman to portray Wolverine.
However, there was one major change that 20th Century wanted for the X-Men which writer David Hayter (who also voiced Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid games) didn’t budge on.
Speaking with Inverse, David Hayter recounted how the studio wanted to change the X-Men character’s Canadian heritage.

     X-Men Writer Reveals One Big Wolverine Change From Studio That He Refused To Include
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As such, when David Hayter was tasked with writing 2000’s X-Men, he was sure to push back against a studio change he was sure wouldn’t sit well with fans: not having Wolverine be Canadian.
I told them, 'Everybody knows that Wolverine is Canadian and the fans will kill you.'
So I don’t blame David Hayter for standing his ground on this aspect of Wolverine given how deeply ingrained it was in the character’s history.
Admittedly, the X-Men movies never delved too deeply into Wolverine’s Canadian background.
Until then, there’s plenty of other articles on upcoming Marvel movies you can read here on CinemaBlend, and many of the Fox-era X-Men movies can be streamed with a Disney+ subscription.

     Summary: Classic Wolverine writer Larry Hama shares his thoughts on the real reason that fans continue to support the character after all these years.
While many X-Men fans love Wolverine for his short temper and brutal fighting style, classic Wolverine writer Larry Hama thinks there's another important and oftentimes overlooked aspect to the character that makes him so popular.
"I got to return to Wolverine recently for Wolverine: Patch and it was great," he said.
See, I'm not a story guy, I'm a character guy.

     Yellowstone wolverine sighting astounds tourists. How common are they in Idaho?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They’re also rarely spotted in Idaho despite having a widespread year-round range, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
Still, according to Fish and Game observation reports, at least one Ada County wolverine sighting has proved accurate.
Fish and Game records all reported wolverine sightings on its website.
So far this year, only two people have reported possible wolverine sightings (neither claim has been reviewed yet, according to the agency’s website).
Phillips said Idaho considers wolverines a population of concern because of the small number of animals in Idaho and their need for specialized environments, including deep snow.
