     Bitcoin up 8% as Biden announces executive order on cryptocurrencies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were higher on Wednesday after President Joe Biden announced his highly-anticipated executive order on digital assets that appeared to take a supportive stance toward the industry.
But the initial spike in prices came ahead of the executive order announcement.
ET Tuesday after the Treasury published details and a statement online in response to the upcoming executive order from the U.S. president on cryptocurrencies.
Biden's executive order attempts to address lack of a framework for the development of cryptocurrencies in the U.S., which critics say could leave the country's industry behind the rest of the world.
"The United States must maintain technological leadership in this rapidly growing space, supporting innovation while mitigating the risks for consumers, businesses, the broader financial system, and the climate," the executive order says.

     Biden to sign crypto executive order opening door for digital dollar, innovation and equity push
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is tackling cryptocurrency and blockchain with a new executive order meant to promote future innovation in the industry while minimizing the financial risks to Americans and the global financial system.
The latest executive order, developed in conversations with major industry players, is bringing in the entire administration to the effort.
The administration's executive order is the most significant intervention the federal government has taken into cryptocurrency and blockchain technology so far.

It will also reportedly task the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which identifies risks to the country's financial stability, to investigate any financial concerns.
The order comes amid concerns over whether Russia could use cryptocurrency to get around the crushing U.S. sanctions issued in response to its invasion of Ukraine.

It shares early insights into the details of President Biden’s soon-to-be-released executive order.
President Biden’s White House has been working on an executive order related to digital assets since January.
An unnamed source told Barron’s said will help “give coherency to what the government is trying to do in this space.”Looks like Yellen's comments on tomorrow's Executive Order were accidentally posted a day early (now removed).
