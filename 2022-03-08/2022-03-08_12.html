     Bitcoin up 8% as Biden announces executive order on cryptocurrencies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were higher on Wednesday after President Joe Biden announced his highly-anticipated executive order on digital assets that appeared to take a supportive stance toward the industry.
But the initial spike in prices came ahead of the executive order announcement.
ET Tuesday after the Treasury published details and a statement online in response to the upcoming executive order from the U.S. president on cryptocurrencies.
Biden's executive order attempts to address lack of a framework for the development of cryptocurrencies in the U.S., which critics say could leave the country's industry behind the rest of the world.
"The United States must maintain technological leadership in this rapidly growing space, supporting innovation while mitigating the risks for consumers, businesses, the broader financial system, and the climate," the executive order says.

     Biden to issue executive order to explore cryptocurrency-like digital dollar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Biden is signing an executive order Wednesday to explore establishing a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) — also known as a "U.S. digital dollar" — akin to a cryptocurrency, according to senior Biden administration officials.
One key difference between the digital dollar and cryptocurrency is that the former would be subject to some regulation by central banks.
So, for instance, the Federal Reserve could issue some monetary policy around issuance rates, address any inflation concerns and more.
Senior Biden administration officials note that already there are more than 100 countries that are looking into issuing their own centralized digital currencies.
The new executive order will also direct the Treasury to develop policy recommendations taking into account what kind of impact a digital dollar would have on the U.S. economy.
