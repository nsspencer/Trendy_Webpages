     Incredibly rare footage of "the unicorn of Yellowstone" (aka a wolverine)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Saturday, a father and daughter touring Yellowstone National Park spotted an exceedingly rare wolverine walking across the highway.
It was trying to get to the other side, of course.
Apparently there are only seven or so wolverines in the entire 3,500 square-mile park.
"It was really magical to see and dad said it was like the unicorn of Yellowstone," said Maya Kemp, age 9.

     Elusive Wolverine Filmed in Yellowstone Park in Incredibly Rare Footage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the rarest animals in Yellowstone has been captured on camera by visitors to the national park.
The video, posted by Carl Kemp to YouTube, shows a wolverine walking across a tarmac road through the park, which is surrounded by snow-covered hills and trees.
The footage offers a rare glimpse of the wolverine, which is an extremely uncommon sight in Yellowstone.
The latest population estimate of wolverines in Yellowstone took place between 2006 and 2009.
The video showed the wolverine scampering along the road before walking up a snow-covered hill and into a bank of trees as onlookers express their amazement at the encounter.

     Yellowstone wolverine sighting astounds tourists. How common are they in Idaho?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They’re also rarely spotted in Idaho despite having a widespread year-round range, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
Still, according to Fish and Game observation reports, at least one Ada County wolverine sighting has proved accurate.
Fish and Game records all reported wolverine sightings on its website.
So far this year, only two people have reported possible wolverine sightings (neither claim has been reviewed yet, according to the agency’s website).
Phillips said Idaho considers wolverines a population of concern because of the small number of animals in Idaho and their need for specialized environments, including deep snow.
