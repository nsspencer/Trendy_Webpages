     Magic Johnson Calls For Lakers Fans to Rally Around Star Russell Westbrook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Magic Johnson spoke in support of Lakers guard Russell Westbrook as the nine-time All-Star has dealt with criticism and been at the center of conversation involving the franchise's struggles to win this season.
“Russell [Westbrook] plays an important role on the Lakers team and will be a key component to the success of the rest of the season and the NBA Playoffs,” Magic tweeted.
“Let's do better, rally around the Westbrook family, and support them.”Westbrook and his wife have three children: 4-year-old Noah and twin 3-year-old daughters, Jordyn and Skye.
As teams continue their push for the NBA playoffs, hopefully Johnson’s public call of support for Westbrook will change the hearts of fans down the stretch.

     Summary: Our unsolicited advice: Ignore it, even when it bugs you.
We don't want to see you do a Malice at the Palace, Russell.
You're a delightful, frustrating wild card, but getting so pissed at the fans that you take a swing at them or something would be the wrong kind of volatility.
And right now, promising to confront fans and letting them know it bothers you is throwing gasoline on the fire.
There's a reason professional athletes always pretend taunting doesn't faze them, and that reason is that there's literally no better solution even when you're seething mad.

     Russell Westbrook hits back after wife receives ‘death wishes’ as Lakers struggle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nine-time NBA All-Star Russell Westbrook has spoken out after his wife, Nina, said she has received “death wishes” as the Los Angeles Lakers’ struggles continue.
The 33-year-old Westbrook, who joined his hometown Lakers in August, has become a focal point for fans’ ire as the 2020 NBA champions struggle to make the playoffs this season.
“I 100% stand behind my wife and how she’s feeling,” Westbrook said after the Lakers lost to the San Antonio Spurs on Monday, their eighth defeat in 10 games.
The 2017 NBA MVP said the insults meant his family no longer wanted to attend Lakers games in person.
If the season ended today, the Lakers would be forced into a play-in tournament to qualify for the first-round of the playoffs.

     Summary: After his wife took to social media to detail the criticism and “death wishes” that she has received, Russell Westbrook used his postgame press conference Monday to expand upon the harassment that he and his family have faced in his first season with the Lakers.
Westbrook has been the target of derision in Los Angeles amid the team’s struggles this year.
While that criticism normally doesn’t affect him, the 14-year veteran said that he and his wife, Nina, are speaking out about the vitriol they’ve received to defend the honor of the “Westbrook” family name and to protect their children.
He tells everybody and walks around and says, ‘I’m Westbrook.’ … And I kind of sat there in shock, and it hit me, like, ‘Damn.
And it’s gotten so bad where my family don’t even want to go to home games, to any game … and it’s just super unfortunate, man.
