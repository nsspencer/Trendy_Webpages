    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Our unsolicited advice: Ignore it, even when it bugs you.
We don't want to see you do a Malice at the Palace, Russell.
You're a delightful, frustrating wild card, but getting so pissed at the fans that you take a swing at them or something would be the wrong kind of volatility.
And right now, promising to confront fans and letting them know it bothers you is throwing gasoline on the fire.
There's a reason professional athletes always pretend taunting doesn't faze them, and that reason is that there's literally no better solution even when you're seething mad.

     Summary: Magic Johnson spoke in support of Lakers guard Russell Westbrook as the nine-time All-Star has dealt with criticism and been at the center of conversation involving the franchise's struggles to win this season.
“Russell [Westbrook] plays an important role on the Lakers team and will be a key component to the success of the rest of the season and the NBA Playoffs,” Magic tweeted.
“Let's do better, rally around the Westbrook family, and support them.”Westbrook and his wife have three children: 4-year-old Noah and twin 3-year-old daughters, Jordyn and Skye.
As teams continue their push for the NBA playoffs, hopefully Johnson’s public call of support for Westbrook will change the hearts of fans down the stretch.

     Summary: Defiance has been the fuel to everything Russell Westbrook has been and accomplished in his NBA career.
Los Angeles Lakers guard Russell Westbrook is clearly on the downslope of his career while playing for the marquee franchise.
Clever timing and capitalizing on Jordan Brand’s part, but it only deepened the impression of Westbrook playing on one person’s terms: his own.
And the Lakers fans who have champagne dreams and have forgotten about the days where Nick Young was the franchise ambassador want it all, all the time.
The Lakers’ overall underachievement needs a facial villain, and Westbrook has always been happy to fill the role.
