     NFL suspends Atlanta Falcons WR Calvin Ridley indefinitely for betting on games during 2021 season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced Monday in a news release that Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley has been suspended for the 2022 NFL season for betting on games.
The release stated that the 27-year-old Ridley bet on games during the 2021 season.
Ridley appeared in five games last season, before stepping away from football in November to address his mental health.
The Atlanta Falcons said in a statement: “We were first made aware of the league’s investigation on Feb. 9.
We are moving forward in the 2022 season with the decision that was made.

     Summary: Rodgers won his fourth MVP award this past season, trailing only Peyton Manning for the most in NFL history (five).
Rodgers has thrown 85 touchdown passes to nine interceptions since the start of the 2020 season with a 116.7 passer rating, all first in the NFL.
He led the NFL in touchdown percentage (7.0), interception percentage (0.8), and passer rating.

     A One-Year Suspension for Calvin Ridley Is Absurd
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I fully understand Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley should not have bet on NFL games.
I fully support the NFL punishing Ridley.
However, a one-year suspension, which Ridley cannot even appeal until Feb. 15, 2023, is over the top.
Here’s where common sense comes in: You know why a player betting on his own team is considered “bad”?
Calvin Ridley has an $11 million contract with the Falcons.

     Summary: The NFL’s franchise tag window was open for the past 10 days, but it will soon close.
For the time being, let’s use this tracker right here to find out who has already used the franchise tag — and who is reportedly expected to follow suit.
Officially franchise-taggedTE David Njoku, Cleveland Browns: The Browns were the first team to officially announce using the franchise tag this offseason.
The two sides were actually working on a contract extension, but no agreement was reached before the closing of the franchise tag window.
(via Ian Rapoport)OT Cam Robinson, Jacksonville Jaguars: After already placing the franchise tag on Robinson last offseason, the Jaguars used it again this year — for good reason.

     Summary: One of the main mile markers of any NFL offseason comes at the deadline for clubs to place the franchise tag on players.
This marks the second time in as many seasons that Godwin would be hit with the franchise tag.
By placing the franchise tag on Godwin, that means Carlton Davis -- one of the top free-agent cornerbacks -- will hit the open market.
Jaguars officially place tag on OT Cam RobinsonFor the second straight year, the Jacksonville Jaguars have placed the franchise tag on on left tackle Cam Robinson.
Dolphins officially place tag on Mike GesickiThe Dolphins will use the franchise tag on Gesicki prior to Tuesday's deadline.
