     Summary: Disney employees furious the company won't denounce Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' billEnlarge this image toggle caption Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP Chris Pizzello/Invision/APDisney employees are showing their outrage over the entertainment company's decision not to denounce Florida's so-called 'Don't Say Gay' bill, which would limit discussion of sexuality and gender in Florida schools.
The Florida Senate passed the bill Tuesday, and it now goes to Gov.
Ben Siemon, an actor and writer whose credits include Disney's DuckTales, posted an impassioned video plea calling for Disney to say the bill is wrong.
Had there been a bill like the one being considered in Florida, Siemon says, "That would've never happened to me.
Siemon implored the company to stop supporting those politicians, ending with the words, "Disney, please say gay."

     ‘Don’t say gay’ bill: Florida senate passes law marginalizing LGBTQ+ people
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The proposal, which opponents have dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, now moves to the desk of the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, who is expected to sign it into law.
I want to encourage parents across Florida to own it,” said state senator Dennis Baxley, a Republican who carried the bill in the senate.
DeSantis has chafed at calling the proposal the “Don’t Say Gay” bill because he said it would apply to instruction on any gender identity or sexual orientation.
“The US Department of Education has made clear that all schools receiving federal funding must follow federal civil rights law, including Title IX’s protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
“We stand with our LGBTQ+ students in Florida and across the country, and urge Florida leaders to make sure all their students are protected and supported.”

     Despite nationwide outcry, FL Senate pushes through “Don’t Say Gay” bill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HB 1557, the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill, passed in the Senate 22 to 17 on Tuesday, with two Republicans joining Democratic senators voting against the bill.
LGBTQ advocates exhausted every effort to kill the bill, but they couldn’t block it at the legislative level.
Equality Florida, a statewide LGBTQ advocacy group, threatened potential legal challenges in a written statement Tuesday.
“The Department of Education has made clear that all schools receiving federal funding must follow federal civil rights law, including Title IX’s protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
So you say — you can’t say that ‘it’s not’ but the bill sponsor says that ‘it is.

     ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill: Florida Senate passes controversial LGBTQ school measure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The measure, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by its opponents, was passed by the state House last month and now heads to Republican Gov.
“This is going to endanger the safety of our LGBTQ students and adolescents,” Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Democrat, said during Tuesday’s debate.
Supporters of the bill say it’s about allowing parents to have control over their children’s education, while opponents say it unfairly targets the LGBTQ community.
Last week, students across Florida staged school walkouts in protest against the bill, which they decried as the state’s latest measure to limit the rights of LGBTQ students.
We stand with our LGBTQ+ students in Florida and across the country, and urge Florida leaders to make sure all their students are protected and supported."

     Tension, condemnations rise as “Don’t say Gay” bill nears vote in Florida Senate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christina Pushaw tweeted Friday in support of the bill that would restrict certain conversations on LGBTQ issues in Florida’s public school classrooms.
The bill is officially called “Parental Rights in Education,” but opponents have been referring to it as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill due to its potential chilling effect in Florida classrooms regarding LGBTQ issues and students.
The LGBTQ community, for example, is worried that students could be “outed” to an unsupportive family, potentially putting LGBTQ students in harm’s way.
HB 1557 was dubbed a “hateful bill” by President Joe Biden on Twitter in early February.
Some senators have offered amendments addressing concerns about the bill, and the Senate will have the opportunity to approve or dismiss those changes.
