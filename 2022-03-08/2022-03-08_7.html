Tune in to see how Jess's farewell episode unfolds when FBI: Most Wanted airs on Tuesday, March 8 at 10 p.m. EST on CBS.

     Summary: [Warning: The below contains MAJOR spoilers for FBI: Most Wanted Season 3, Episode 14 “Shattered.”]That episode title is a pretty apt description for how we feel after watching Julian McMahon‘s last episode of FBI: Most Wanted.
While tracking down a man who abused his girlfriend and protecting her, Jess was killed in the line of duty.
It ends with the emotional impact of that on Sarah, and then on Byron and Sarah, as they go to tell Tali.
Did I catch a Clinton [Nathaniel Arcand, who left in Season 2] reference when Jess mentioned his brother-in-law in Florida?
Was that something you wanted to make sure to do with Jess’ last episode?
