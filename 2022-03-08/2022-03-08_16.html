     Von Miller Has Made His Intentions Clear
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Von Miller is one of the few active NFL players that has nothing to prove.
He was the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl 50 and was also a key contributor for the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI.
I kinda want that old thing back.. 5280 — Von Miller (@VonMiller) March 7, 2022Miller tweeted, “I kinda want that old thing back.. 5280.”He is clearly alluding to the elevation of Denver, Colorado, a mile up in the sky.
The Broncos have around $39 million in cap space which is big enough to absorb a contract he deserves.
Besides, why wouldn’t Miller be happy on a team that gives him a legitimate shot of winning another Super Bowl?

     Von Miller's Cryptic Denver Tweet Goes Viral After Russell Wilson Trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now that Russell Wilson is in Denver, it makes Miller’s tweets very, very interesting.
Soon-to-be free agent Von Miller is entering his 12th year in the NFL and is creating quite the buzz on social media.
The 32-year-old linebacker just won his second Super Bowl and has a few different options on the table.
Miller said that he kinda wants that old thing back and listed 5280, which is the altitude in Denver.
If Miller wanted the old thing back before, he certainly wants it back now— with a new, Pro Bowl quarterback in town.

     Could Aaron Rodgers’ contract extension alter Von Miller’s free agency fate?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams seem optimistic they can retain Von Miller when free agency begins next week, and their hopes of keeping him for next season and beyond just may have gotten better.
The Broncos were one of the favorites to land quarterback Aaron Rodgers should he want to join a team other than the Green Bay Packers next season.
But Rodgers and the Packers just agreed to a massive contract extension worth 4 years and $200M, per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network.
pic.twitter.com/Fbs3nAuAfn — Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) February 17, 2022It worked - and the veteran’s contributions played a large part in the Super Bowl run.
Was Aaron Rodgers’ contract extension with Green Bay enough to keep Miller in LA?

     3 ideal Von Miller landing spots in NFL free agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As he enters his eleventh year in the league, Von Miller is still a consistently reliable pass-rush option in the NFL.
Not only is he a notable addition to any team’s pass rush, but he is a veteran leader that was key in helping the Los Angeles Rams win Super Bowl LVI.
With that in mind, here are the three teams that would be ideal lands spots for Miller in NFL free agency.
However, the Ravens pass rush was also a notable disappointment as well.
The Jets have the money to blow other suitors out of the water, and they badly need the pass rush help.
