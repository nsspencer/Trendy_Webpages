     At Hall of Fame induction, Tiger Woods reflects on a career that changed the face of golf
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tiger who took the stage, however, was more lover than fighter.
In a reflective and nostalgic mood, Woods’ comments, which he made without notes or a teleprompter, focused largely on his modest upbringing in Southern California.
He reminisced on playing golf in the dark with his father, who would only let them stay if he found the ball, a bit of tough love that taught Tiger to feel shots without having to see them.
(He once made it through 17 holes without light, but never quite got through a full round).
And he spoke solemnly of the sacrifices his parents took to allow him to travel the country playing junior golf tournaments, where he faced discrimination as a biracial kid in a lily-white game.
