     US cannot confirm the death of Russian general, senior US defense official says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia has launched “nearly 670” missiles since the beginning of their invasion of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday.
Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, “the other half largely from inside Ukraine,” the official said.
Putin has “nearly 100 percent” of the combat power that he amassed for this invasion inside of Ukraine and Putin “still has 95 percent of the combat power that he started with,” the official added.
Most of Ukraine is covered by “some sort of Russian surface-to-air missile capability,” the official told reporters.
“It’s very contested air space, and as I’ve said before, Russians have not achieved air superiority over the whole country,” the official said.

     A second Russian general has reportedly been killed in Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two Russian generals have reportedly been killed since the country began its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Gerasimov’s death comes just days after Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, deputy commander of the same unit, was killed in the fighting in Ukraine.
The news of Gerasimov’s death is based on intercepted “expletive-ridden phone conversations” between Russian officials, according to BBC News.
In one phone call, the officials “complain that secure communication lines have been lost,” BBC reports, and in another, Russian officials reportedly said Gerasimov was killed and other Russian troops were wounded.
Additionally, U.S. defense officials “know of no familial connection” between Gerasimov and the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, General of the Army Valery Gerasimov.

     Ukrainian Intelligence Claims Senior Russian General Killed Near Kharkiv, Second In Recent Days
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In concert with Washington's move, Britain said it would also phase out Russian oil by the end of the year while the EU, which is heavily dependent on Russian energy supplies, planned to slash gas imports by two-thirds.
The U.S. ban on Russian oil imports is adding to existing concerns about the legal and financial risks of buying and trading Russian energy, says Ben Cahill, an energy analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
China "can't soak up" all of Russia's oil and gas that currently goes to the West and won't pay the same high prices Europeans historically have, Cahill said.
The evacuation came hours after Russian air strikes overnight on Sumy killed 21 people, including two children, according to the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office.
WATCH: Thousands of people are trying to flee the Ukrainian city of Irpin for the capital, Kyiv, almost 25 kilometers away.
