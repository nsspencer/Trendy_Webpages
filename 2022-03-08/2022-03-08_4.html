     Apple unveils a new iPhone, a new iPad and other devices.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple’s latest product showcase on Tuesday had all the hallmarks of a typical launch for the world’s most valuable public company: vibrant colors, upbeat music, a slate of incremental product improvements and a surprise.
In a video presentation, the company unveiled a new, faster iPhone SE, the entry-level version of its flagship product, bumping the price to $429 from the older version’s $399.
Apple also introduced a speedier iPad Air tablet for $599.
And it announced the Mac Studio, a powerful desktop computer that is like an upgraded version of the Mac Mini.
Apple also said that two weekly Friday night Major League Baseball games would begin airing exclusively on Apple TV Plus, the company’s streaming service.

     Apple's Mac Studio Is a Mightier Desktop for Creative Pros
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's safe to say the Mac Studio is like the Mac Mini on steroids, with a ton more features inside and out.
The Mac Studio looks like a taller Mac Mini.
Since this design requires less fan-spinning action to keep things chill, the Mac Studio should stay quiet even when it's handling more power-intensive tasks.
Photograph: AppleThe Mac Studio can connect to any monitor of your choosing, but Apple has also designed a display to match the desktop.
The new Studio Display is a 27-inch monitor with 5K resolution.
