    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple’s latest product showcase on Tuesday had all the hallmarks of a typical launch for the world’s most valuable public company: vibrant colors, upbeat music, a slate of incremental product improvements and a surprise.
In a video presentation, the company unveiled a new, faster iPhone SE, the entry-level version of its flagship product, bumping the price to $429 from the older version’s $399.
Apple also introduced a speedier iPad Air tablet for $599.
And it announced the Mac Studio, a powerful desktop computer that is like an upgraded version of the Mac Mini.
Apple also said that two weekly Friday night Major League Baseball games would begin airing exclusively on Apple TV Plus, the company’s streaming service.

Oh, and the nano-texture option on the glass to reduce glare will cost an additional $300 over the display’s base price.
The base model has 32GB of unified memory, with an option to pay $400 for 64GB.
Going higher than that, to 128GB, requires the M1 Ultra chip and will set you back $1200 from the base model.
(Obviously, it’s a little cheaper if you start with the M1 Ultra model.)
