     Apple’s Mac Studio is a new desktop for creative professionals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple has announced the Mac Studio, a desktop system that looks like the Mac Mini on the outside but packs a lot more power on the inside.
The Mac Studio features both Apple’s M1 Max chip and a new, even more powerful processor, the M1 Ultra.
The Studio is compatible with Apple’s Studio Display, an external monitor that was also unveiled today.
The Studio Display has a 27-inch 5K screen that can reach 600 nits of brightness and also includes a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera.
The Mac Studio with M1 Max will start at $1,999, and M1 Ultra models will start at $3,999.

     Apple unveils first budget 5G iPhone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the standout product was a new budget iPhone with access to 5G networks.
Apple's new iPhone SE, only the third version since the model launched in 2017, runs on the company's faster A15 Bionic chip, the same in-house processor that drives the iPhone 13 line.
When Apple released its second version of the iPhone SE in April 2020, the budget smartphone seemed well-suited for the moment.
"Consumers were uncertain about the outlook and an affordable iPhone was ideally placed to take advantage of that," said Ben Wood, an analyst with market research firm CCS Insight.
"In 2022 things have improved but the iPhone SE franchise still fills an important role as an affordable iPhone for consumers still cautious about splashing out on a top-of-the-line iPhone or who just don't feel the need to spend more than is necessary."
