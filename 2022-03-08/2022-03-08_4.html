The "Before He Cheats" songstress was all smiles ahead of the award show — where she and Jason Aldean won Single of the Year for "If I Didn't Love You" — while showing off her toned legs in a shimmery silver dress and strappy heels.
Posing alone, Underwood kept her long blonde locks down and matched her jaw-dropping number with a sparkling purse.
