     Apple unveils a new iPhone, a new iPad and other devices.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple’s latest product showcase on Tuesday had all the hallmarks of a typical launch for the world’s most valuable public company: vibrant colors, upbeat music, a slate of incremental product improvements and a surprise.
In a video presentation, the company unveiled a new, faster iPhone SE, the entry-level version of its flagship product, bumping the price to $429 from the older version’s $399.
Apple also introduced a speedier iPad Air tablet for $599.
And it announced the Mac Studio, a powerful desktop computer that is like an upgraded version of the Mac Mini.
Apple also said that two weekly Friday night Major League Baseball games would begin airing exclusively on Apple TV Plus, the company’s streaming service.

     Apple Continues Its Slow March Toward the MacPad Future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But next week, Apple will begin shipping a device that closely resembles a MacBook with a touchscreen.
To be clear, Apple didn’t show off a MacBook during Tuesday’s virtual product launch event.
Apple's new device is the 2022 iPad Air, the fifth generation of this product line.
And Apple has consistently rejected the idea that it would ever put a touchscreen into one of its laptops.
The company’s software chief, Craig Federighi, told WIRED in a 2018 interview that “lifting your arm up to poke a screen is a pretty fatiguing thing to do.” Message received: Touchscreen laptops are bad (despite the millions of Windows touchscreen laptops that have sold).

     Summary: If you’re looking for a quick round-up, here are the biggest announcements Apple made in its hour-long presentation.
Apple announced a new addition to its Apple Silicon lineup, with the M1 Ultra.
The M1 Ultra will be available in the Mac Studio and likely in the Mac Pro that Apple teased as an upcoming announcement.

The discontinuation of the 27-inch, Intel-based iMac wasn’t explicitly announced on stage, but they’ve disappeared from Apple’s store.

     Summary: By Dan MorenPeek Performance: A few details Apple didn’t discuss onstageAs always, the facts come fast and furious at an Apple event, so some details about its latest products fall through the cracks.
Oh, and the nano-texture option on the glass to reduce glare will cost an additional $300 over the display’s base price.
The base model has 32GB of unified memory, with an option to pay $400 for 64GB.
Going higher than that, to 128GB, requires the M1 Ultra chip and will set you back $1200 from the base model.
(Obviously, it’s a little cheaper if you start with the M1 Ultra model.)

The iPad Air and the joy of re-using hardwareTuesday’s iPad Air update was anything but surprising.
The iPad Air got 5G cellular and support for Center Stage, which the iPad mini already had.
But I don’t think it will be capable of being specced up into the equivalent of a Mac Studio.

     Summary: It's safe to say the Mac Studio is like the Mac Mini on steroids, with a ton more features inside and out.
The Mac Studio looks like a taller Mac Mini.
Since this design requires less fan-spinning action to keep things chill, the Mac Studio should stay quiet even when it's handling more power-intensive tasks.

The new Studio Display is a 27-inch monitor with 5K resolution.

     Summary: More women presented at its March 8 Apple Event than ever before, and it happened without Apple patronizingly championing the fact.
Four of the seven presenters at Apple's March 8 event, and all six developers interviewed, were women.
And when we get there, it will be in part because of people and companies using women and men for what they do and say, rather than ever because of their gender.
But Apple didn't showcase any quota, it didn't make a meal out of how it's finally using women presenters.
Most of the other women I knew in engineering teams at Apple were the only women on their teams.
