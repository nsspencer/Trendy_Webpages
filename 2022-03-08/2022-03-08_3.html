     Summary: The Packers' latest offseason dance with Aaron Rodgers is finished, and it might have been their last.
Green Bay is putting its money where its mouth is, agreeing with the 38-year-old Rodgers on a four-year extension worth $200 million, including $153 million in guaranteed money, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Tuesday.
The deal makes Rodgers the highest-paid player in NFL history on an annual basis while also reducing his salary-cap number for 2022.
With Rodgers' new, lower cap number now factored in, Green Bay can place the franchise tag on Adams before Tuesday's 4 p.m.
Pat McAfee of "The Pat McAfee Show" first reported the news of Rodgers' deal.

     Summary: Aaron Rodgers says he will remain with Packers next seasonRodgers sent out a tweet Tuesday afternoon confirming his return.
Rodgers wanted to avoid a repeat of 2021, when his status was uncertain until the start of training camp after he skipped the Packers‚Äô mandatory minicamp.
After referring to his future as a ‚Äúbeautiful mystery‚Äù late in the 2020 season, Rodgers skipped the Packers‚Äô organized team activities and mandatory minicamp in a standoff with team management.
When asked before the season whether he had been vaccinated against COVID-19, Rodgers replied, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm immunized.‚Äù But after testing positive during the season, Rodgers acknowledged he was unvaccinated and said he instead had sought alternative treatments.
Packers coach Matt LaFleur, Gutekunst and president/CEO Mark Murphy said after the season they all wanted Rodgers back in 2022.

     Summary: Stephen A. Smith is more focused on Aaron Rodgers' ability to win another championship than his new deal with the Packers.
Aaron Rodgers is not done with the Green Bay Packers just yet, and now there really is a chance the four-time NFL MVP will finish his career in the same place it started.
In fact, throughout the season, Rodgers offered unprompted praise for moves Gutekunst made, including signing of veterans like cornerback Rasul Douglas and pass-rusher Whitney Mercilus.
A day later, LaFleur said that feeling extended to Gutekunst, team president Mark Murphy and director of football operations Russ Ball.
Last season, Rodgers broke Favre's franchise record of 442 career touchdown passes, finishing the season with 449.

     Analysis: What Does Aaron Rodgers' New Deal Mean For Russell Wilson's Future With Seahawks?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, Green Bay struck a deal with Rodgers on a record-smashing four-year, $200 million extension.
But the contractual agreement between Rodgers and Green Bay will assuredly have ripple effects in regard to the future of Seattle's own quarterback Russell Wilson.
In the past, agent Mark Rodgers has built the framework of his client's prior two extensions off of benchmarks established by Aaron Rodgers' previous contracts.
In 2013, Rodgers signed a five-year, $110 million contract to become the highest-paid player in NFL history.
Like Rodgers, Wilson has been engulfed in trade speculation for the past two offseasons that he helped create on his own accord.
