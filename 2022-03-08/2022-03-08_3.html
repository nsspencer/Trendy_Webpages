     Miami Heat: Victor Oladipo Brings A Different Energy To Rotation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After missing nearly the whole season for the Miami Heat due to a knee recovery process, Victor Oladipo finally returned to NBA action against the Houston Rockets.
They had traded for him last year, but he only played four games for the Heat before going down last season.
The return of Oladipo could not have come for a better time for the Heat either.
While Oladipo begins his adjustment back to the NBA pace, let’s take a look at the player that the Miami Heat are adding to their already stacked roster.
Who is Victor Oladipo?

     Summary: “You go through all the emotions,” the former All-Star said of a day punctuated with 11 points, four assists, two 3-pointers, a rebound, but one about far more than statistics.
“Even though I’ve been playing basketball pretty much my whole life, it’s funny, I was telling Gabe [Vincent, a fellow Heat guard], before the game started, ‘Man, every first time feels like the first time.
You want to do well.
You want to play well.
You want to help the team win.’

     Rockets’ coach Stephen Silas pleased to see Victor Oladipo back despite loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Outside of watching Jalen Green score 14 of his 20 points in the first quarter, there wasn’t much for coach Stephen Silas to be happy about Monday night.
The shorthanded Houston Rockets fell to 16-49 on the season, after a 123-106 defeat to the Miami Heat inside the FTZ Arena.
The return of Victor Oladipo was a pleasing sight for Silas.
Oladipo, a two-time NBA All-Star with the Indiana Pacers, was no longer suiting up for the lowly Rockets.
During his season debut against the Rockets, Oladipo scored 11 points while shooting 57.1 percent from the field.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Victor Oladipo, a former All-Star (and a soulful singer to boot ) has been on the mend all season, recovering from surgery on his quad tendon.
Let's just say his injury-ravaged, three-team campaign during the 2020-21 season was a whirlwind for everyone involved.
Kyle Lowry, the shiny new sign-and-trade toy from the summer, has been unavailable for large swaths of the season.
His burst wasn't at 2018 levels — nor should that be the expectation — but he certainly didn't look overwhelmed.
What does Oladipo look like against stiffer defensive attention?

     ‘Hail to the Victor’: breaking down Oladipo’s return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the biggest win for Miami on Monday was the play of Victor Oladipo, who made his long-awaited return from a right quadriceps surgery.
Oladipo gets a clean look and gets his first bucket in nearly one year.
On this play, Victor pauses for half a second to observe the floor after receiving a pass in the corner from Caleb Martin.
It could have been a reason why he was interested to become a player for the Miami Heat.
“Oh, hail to the Victor,” Heat play-by-play announcer Eric Reid said after.
