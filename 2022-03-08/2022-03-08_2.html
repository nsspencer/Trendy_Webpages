     Apple set to show off new products at first big event of the year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Apple (AAPL) is about to hold its first big product event of the year.
The event comes at a time of some turbulence for Apple and the broader business community.
Apple recently announced that it would stop selling products in Russia amid the ongoing conflict with Ukraine.
Like other companies, Apple has also had to confront supply chain issues for its products in recent months, though CEO Tim Cook previously said supply chain delays over the holiday shopping season have since improved.
At last year's spring event, Apple unveiled a new iPad Pro, colorful iMacs and a purple iPhone.

     Apple Store Down Ahead of 'Peek Performance' Apple Event
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple's online storefront has gone down ahead of its "Peek Performance" virtual event taking place later today, where a handful of new products are expected to be announced.
Apple is expected to announce the next-generation version of the iPhone SE, a revamped iPad Air, and at least one Mac with an Apple silicon chip, which could be the rumored "Mac Studio" machine.
Apple is also said to be unveiling a new standalone display, which could be called "Studio Display."
The event tagline, "Peek performance," has also prompted suggestions that Apple may offer a peek at a future product, but that remains purely speculative.
MacRumors will have in-depth coverage of Apple's event, which kicks off at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, including a live blog on our website and tweets via @MacRumorsLive on Twitter.
