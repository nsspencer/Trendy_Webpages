     Seahawks Plan to Trade Russell Wilson to the Broncos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russell Wilson, the face of the Seattle Seahawks for the past decade, is expected to head to Denver as part of a multi-player trade with the Broncos.
The deal cannot proceed until Wilson waives his no-trade clause and cannot be finalized until every player in the deal passes a physical.
No formal announcement will be made by the teams involved until the new league year begins on March 16.
Those speed bumps aside, Wilson, who was voted to nine Pro Bowls and led Seattle to its only Super Bowl title after the 2013 season, will instantly make the Broncos a contender in the already competitive A.F.C.
The Broncos finished last in the division the past two years and have not played in the postseason since the 2015 season, when they won the Super Bowl.
