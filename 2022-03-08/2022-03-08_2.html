     Broncos Twitter account gets creative to celebrate Russell Wilson trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hours after the Packers reportedly brought back four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers, the Broncos stole the headlines with their reported blockbuster deal to acquire quarterback Russell Wilson from the Seahawks.
Social media, naturally, was abuzz with reactions, including from the Broncos’s own Twitter account—though with an added wink.
It’s worth considering whether the Broncos's social media team considered the fate of the famous volleyball from the 2000 film Cast Away.
Hanks (spoiler alert) does eventually get saved, so perhaps the movie’s ending represents the type of happy ending Denver is looking for.

     Broncos land QB Russell Wilson from Seahawks in blockbuster trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The deal, requires Wilson to waive his no trade clause, brings a stunning end to a stunning 10-year run for the Seahawks.
Since Peyton Manning retired after the 2015 season, the Broncos have started 12 different players at quarterback.
At last week's NFL scouting combine, Broncos general manager George Paton confirmed the Broncos would be "aggressive" in finding a quarterback.
"I think it's always a priority," Paton said of the Broncos' quarterback situation.
Wilson will get a chance to face off against his former team in 2022, as the Broncos are scheduled to play at the Seahawks.

     Broncos acquiring Seahawks QB Russell Wilson in trade including Drew Lock, multiple picks, players
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's not Aaron Rodgers, but the Denver Broncos made their splash play for a Super Bowl-winning quarterback.
NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday the Seahawks and Broncos agreed in principle on a trade sending quarterback Russell Wilson to Denver for a massive haul, including multiple first-round draft picks, plus additional picks and players, per sources informed of the decision.
The trade is pending a physical and Wilson waiving his no-trade clause, and it cannot be finalized until the new league year begins March 16.
Denver had been in quarterback purgatory since Peyton Manning's retirement following the 2015 season, cycling through signal-callers without an answer.
But he caught fire again down the stretch, indicating the issues were related more to injury than any sort of decline.
