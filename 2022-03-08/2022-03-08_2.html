     Seahawks Plan to Trade Russell Wilson to the Broncos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russell Wilson, the face of the Seattle Seahawks for the past decade, is expected to head to Denver as part of a multi-player trade with the Broncos.
The deal cannot proceed until Wilson waives his no-trade clause and cannot be finalized until every player in the deal passes a physical.
No formal announcement will be made by the teams involved until the new league year begins on March 16.
Those speed bumps aside, Wilson, who was voted to nine Pro Bowls and led Seattle to its only Super Bowl title after the 2013 season, will instantly make the Broncos a contender in the already competitive A.F.C.
The Broncos finished last in the division the past two years and have not played in the postseason since the 2015 season, when they won the Super Bowl.

     Broncos Twitter account gets creative to celebrate Russell Wilson trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hours after the Packers reportedly brought back four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers, the Broncos stole the headlines with their reported blockbuster deal to acquire quarterback Russell Wilson from the Seahawks.
Social media, naturally, was abuzz with reactions, including from the Broncos’s own Twitter account—though with an added wink.
It’s worth considering whether the Broncos's social media team considered the fate of the famous volleyball from the 2000 film Cast Away.
Hanks (spoiler alert) does eventually get saved, so perhaps the movie’s ending represents the type of happy ending Denver is looking for.

     Broncos land QB Russell Wilson from Seahawks in blockbuster trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The deal, requires Wilson to waive his no trade clause, brings a stunning end to a stunning 10-year run for the Seahawks.
Since Peyton Manning retired after the 2015 season, the Broncos have started 12 different players at quarterback.
At last week's NFL scouting combine, Broncos general manager George Paton confirmed the Broncos would be "aggressive" in finding a quarterback.
"I think it's always a priority," Paton said of the Broncos' quarterback situation.
Wilson will get a chance to face off against his former team in 2022, as the Broncos are scheduled to play at the Seahawks.

     The Russell Wilson trade seems justifiable, but the Seahawks had better be right
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Wilson trade was always a shadowy concept, lurking in the realm of possibility but seemingly too complex and too fraught with danger to actually be pulled off.
Yet Aaron Rodgers agreeing to a massive new contract with the Green Bay Packers on Tuesday, a few hours before the Wilson trade was announced, has obvious ramifications for Wilson.
Remember, when Wilson got his first extension, it was for $21.9 million annually — $100,000 less than Rodgers’ $22 million.
It’s what Carroll and Schneider effectively staked their futures on Tuesday with the trade heard ‘round the world.
And the Seahawks, specifically Carroll and Schneider, had better be right, or what happened Tuesday will be the albatross they’ll carry forever.

     Broncos acquiring Seahawks QB Russell Wilson in trade including Drew Lock, multiple picks, players
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's not Aaron Rodgers, but the Denver Broncos made their splash play for a Super Bowl-winning quarterback.
NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday the Seahawks and Broncos agreed in principle on a trade sending quarterback Russell Wilson to Denver for a massive haul, including multiple first-round draft picks, plus additional picks and players, per sources informed of the decision.
The trade is pending a physical and Wilson waiving his no-trade clause, and it cannot be finalized until the new league year begins March 16.
Denver had been in quarterback purgatory since Peyton Manning's retirement following the 2015 season, cycling through signal-callers without an answer.
But he caught fire again down the stretch, indicating the issues were related more to injury than any sort of decline.

     Summary: Adam Schefter details the trade that will send Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson to the Broncos for a plethora of picks and players.
Denver general manager George Paton initiated trade talks with Seattle for Wilson at least two weeks ago, per sources.
But in recent days, as trade talks with Seattle heated up, it became clear that Wilson was the Broncos' Plan A.
The Broncos' odds to win the Super Bowl improved from 25-1 to 12-1 Tuesday at Caesars Sportsbook.
The Seahawks, meanwhile, saw their odds to win the Super Bowl fall from 40-1 to 75-1 at Caesars.
