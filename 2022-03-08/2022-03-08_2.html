     BREAKING: Seahawks trading Russell Wilson to the Broncos in absolute stunner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Seattle Seahawks won their first (and so far only) Super Bowl in franchise history against the Denver Broncos.
These teams were former AFC rivals and in the 2013 season we saw the best defense trash the best offense, while Russell Wilson became a champion in just his second season.
Seattle is now trading Russell Wilson to Denver.
This is not an Adam Schefter fake account, this is real ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter.
Denver acquiring Russell Wilson has nothing to do with the Aaron Rodgers' decision to return to Green Bay.

     Report: Seahawks Sending Russell Wilson to Broncos in Blockbuster Trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russell Wilson is no longer the quarterback of the Seahawks.
Trade is pending a physical and approval from Wilson, who has a no-trade clause.
But every player has a price and apparently the Broncos provided a deal they simply couldn't refuse for the franchise quarterback.
A trade ultimately didn't happen and Wilson and the organization worked to smooth things over after the draft, speaking amicably about the state of their partnership.
In recent weeks, Wilson made public statements indicating he loved playing in Seattle and hoped to continue his career in the Pacific Northwest.

     Broncos acquiring Seahawks QB Russell Wilson in trade including Drew Lock, multiple picks, players
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's not Aaron Rodgers, but the Denver Broncos made their splash play for a Super Bowl-winning quarterback.
NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday the Seahawks and Broncos agreed in principle on a trade sending quarterback Russell Wilson to Denver for a massive haul, including multiple first-round draft picks, plus additional picks and players, per sources informed of the decision.
The trade is pending a physical and Wilson waiving his no-trade clause, and it cannot be finalized until the new league year begins March 16.
Denver had been in quarterback purgatory since Peyton Manning's retirement following the 2015 season, cycling through signal-callers without an answer.
But he caught fire again down the stretch, indicating the issues were related more to injury than any sort of decline.

     Seattle Seahawks agree to trade QB Russell Wilson to Denver Broncos, get three players, picks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adam Schefter details the trade that will send Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson to the Broncos for a plethora of picks and players.
Denver general manager George Paton initiated trade talks with Seattle for Wilson at least two weeks ago, per sources.
But in recent days, as trade talks with Seattle heated up, it became clear that Wilson was the Broncos' Plan A.
The Broncos' odds to win the Super Bowl improved from 25-1 to 12-1 Tuesday at Caesars Sportsbook.
The Seahawks, meanwhile, saw their odds to win the Super Bowl fall from 40-1 to 75-1 at Caesars.
