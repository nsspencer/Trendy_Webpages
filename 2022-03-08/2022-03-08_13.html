     Salzburg Made Things Easy For Bayern Munich
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To beat Bayern Munich in a Champions League knockout tie, a team has to be two things above all: It has to be talented, and it has to be disciplined.
You wouldn’t have known it watching Tuesday’s second leg, though.
A team should work exceedingly hard not to gift Bayern goals, and especially in Munich, but Salzburg did just that, conceding two penalties in the first 21 minutes of the match.
Instead, Bayern scored three more in the second 45 minutes, two from Müller and one from Leroy Sané.
There’s no shame in losing to Bayern, even badly, but it should never be quite this easy.

     Bayern Munich vs. Salzburg score: Robert Lewandowski's record hattrick crucial in Champions League rout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bayern Munich are into the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals after a 7-1 thrashing of Red Bull Salzburg completed a 8-2 aggregate success which featured a Robert Lewandowski hat-trick at Allianz Arena on Wednesday.
It was a fascinating tie overall as the first leg showed Bayern at their most vulnerable with Lewandowski frustrated in front of goal and no Manuel Neuer between the sticks.
So with the Poland international particularly purposeful from the off in leg two, Bayern ended up looking like a completely different, and frighteningly dominant team.
Granted, the visiting midfield let themselves down badly, but they were also not overrun the way the result might have suggested.
Much will depend on what the quarterfinals bring, and whether stiffer opposition can take advantage of the German giants need to be on the front foot.

     Bayern Munich Finds Its Escalation Gear
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No club turns on the relentlessness quite like Bayern, which Salzburg found out the hard way after entering their UCL last-16 second leg with hopes of a famous upset.
It’s a very modern form of superclub wobble, given that Bayern leads the Bundesliga by nine points, but the relentless attacking has not been quite so relentless recently.
And it will also be of concern to Bayern how open it had looked before the second goal.
That hints at a wider issue for Bayern, which is that its squad is not as deep as the elite clubs of the Premier League.
The question here was whether Bayern could get by Salzburg, and that it did easily—and in some style.
