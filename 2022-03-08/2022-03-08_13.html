     Kylie Jenner's Ex-BFF Tammy Hembrow Reignites Feud Over Baby Name Drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kardashians star Kylie Jenner's ex-best friend Tammy Hembrow is still holding a grudge against the makeup mogul over her reportedly stealing her baby name and using it for her new baby, Wolf Webster.
Not long after, the Kardashian-Jenners unfollowed Tammy on Instagram, and rumors spread that the model was hooking up with Kylie's ex-boyfriend, Tyga.
She later revealed she had named her son Wolf, which is the same name as Tammy's six-year-old son.
Perhaps she's still angry at the Kylie Beauty founder over their Tyga feud or birthday drama, but it's probably time she let the baby name drama go.
