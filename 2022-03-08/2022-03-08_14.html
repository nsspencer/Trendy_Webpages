     Summary: Our unsolicited advice: Ignore it, even when it bugs you.
We don't want to see you do a Malice at the Palace, Russell.
You're a delightful, frustrating wild card, but getting so pissed at the fans that you take a swing at them or something would be the wrong kind of volatility.
And right now, promising to confront fans and letting them know it bothers you is throwing gasoline on the fire.
There's a reason professional athletes always pretend taunting doesn't faze them, and that reason is that there's literally no better solution even when you're seething mad.

     Lakers: Russell Westbrook Opens Up About Harassment From Fans in Los Angeles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles has always been a very tough place to play professional sports.
Russell Westbrook is right in the middle of experiencing that for the first time in his professional career.
After a loss to the Spurs on Monday night, Russ spoke in depth about the verbal abuse he and his family have endured while in Los Angeles.
Right now, she's[his wife] reached a point and my family have reached a point where it's really weighing on them."
Russ' tone suggests that rumors he would like to leave the Lakers this offseason actually do carry some weight.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Magic Johnson spoke in support of Lakers guard Russell Westbrook as the nine-time All-Star has dealt with criticism and been at the center of conversation involving the franchise's struggles to win this season.
“Russell [Westbrook] plays an important role on the Lakers team and will be a key component to the success of the rest of the season and the NBA Playoffs,” Magic tweeted.
“Let's do better, rally around the Westbrook family, and support them.”Westbrook and his wife have three children: 4-year-old Noah and twin 3-year-old daughters, Jordyn and Skye.
As teams continue their push for the NBA playoffs, hopefully Johnson’s public call of support for Westbrook will change the hearts of fans down the stretch.

     Summary: As Russell Westbrook openly detailed what he and his family have experienced this year following the Lakers’ loss to the Spurs, one thing became crystal clear — this is a person who is not comfortable at his workplace.
The team still has games left to play, and a play-in tournament spot they must cling onto if they want to keep their postseason hopes alive.
But regardless of the decision, the conversation needs to happen, for everyone’s sake, which brings us to today’s episode.

https://t.co/no5aQaAUYN — Dejounte Murray (@DejounteMurray) March 8, 2022Murray even shared an endearing video of himself talking to Westbrook after the Spurs took on the Lakers on Tuesday.
Even Lakers icon Magic Johnson, who has been one of Russ’ staunchest critics this season, came out to show his full support for Westbrook.
Russ clearly isn’t in a very good place right now and he needs all the support he can get.

1) Russell Westbrook is legitimately hurting from personal attacks and deserves to be treated with more decency and respect.
2) Russell Westbrook is acting like a baby.
It’s tough to imagine any scenario in which Russell Westbrook returns to the Lakers next season.

Sure, Kevin Durant was called a snake by heckling fans, Anthony Davis has been called street clothes.
Lakers fans should respect Russell Westbrook’s request.
Just because a fan may not see the importance of a last name does not mean that they should ignore the fact that it does mean something to Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook deserves the respect of a human being, and quite frankly, we all could respect each other a bit more.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Defiance has been the fuel to everything Russell Westbrook has been and accomplished in his NBA career.
Los Angeles Lakers guard Russell Westbrook is clearly on the downslope of his career while playing for the marquee franchise.
Clever timing and capitalizing on Jordan Brand’s part, but it only deepened the impression of Westbrook playing on one person’s terms: his own.
And the Lakers fans who have champagne dreams and have forgotten about the days where Nick Young was the franchise ambassador want it all, all the time.
The Lakers’ overall underachievement needs a facial villain, and Westbrook has always been happy to fill the role.
