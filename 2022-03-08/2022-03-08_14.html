     Poland to Make MiG-29 Combat Jets Available to U.S.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WARSAW—Poland said it would make its Soviet-made MiG-29 combat jets available to the U.S., after days of talks about how to get such planes into the hands of Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia’s offensive, but the proposal drew a cool reaction from the Pentagon.
The Polish government on Tuesday said the planes “are ready to deploy—immediately and free of charge.” The aircraft would be flown to the American Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where they would be at the disposal of the U.S., Poland’s Foreign Ministry said.

     Why is Poland giving MiG-29 fighter jets to the US – and is it a risky move?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Is Ukraine getting extra fighter planes from Poland?
Its air force, though still flying, remains outnumbered by its opponent.
However, any new planes need to be ones that Ukraine’s pilots are trained to use.
But if the US is transferring the fighters to Ukraine, Russia may not want to engage the Americans directly.
If what is left of Ukraine’s air force were to sustain further losses it would soon reach the point where it is unable to defend itself from attack in the skies.

     U.S. all but declines Poland’s offer to give Ukraine its old warplanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Poland has sought to equip Ukraine with aircraft to fight Russia even as Moscow has warned that any country hosting Ukraine’s military aircraft would be considered a party to the ongoing armed conflict there.
AdvertisementKirby raised the prospect that Poland’s proposal could inflame tensions with Russia, which has depicted the conflict in Ukraine as one against Western aggression.
Washington has sent billions of dollars in military equipment to Ukraine in recent years.
The offer would have served Poland by bolstering Ukraine’s resistance to Russia, a mutual geopolitical foe, and enhancing its own military.
“Very little of the nation of Ukraine is not covered by some sort of Russian surface-to-air missile capability,” the defense official said.

“At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities.

A senior US defense official, meanwhile, told CNN that they've seen the Polish government’s announcement and "have nothing to offer at this time."
The Polish announcement comes after some Polish officials were frustrated by how forward leaning the US was on this subject over the weekend, the sources said.

“To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us that they plan to give these planes to us,” Nuland told Congress.
The deployment is intended to provide a layer of protection against the Ukraine conflict spilling over the country’s western border.
Poland announced its plan as US officials said the war in Ukraine had reached a pivotal moment, with Russia sustaining severe losses but with Putin determined to press on.

Poland asked the United States to “provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities,” after reports the United States has weighed replenishing Poland’s fleet with American-made F-16 fighter jets.
That’s how many one- and two-seat MiG-29 fighter jets remain in Poland’s fleet, according to Janes World Air Forces.
NBC also reported on logistical problems that could make it difficult to fly planes directly to Ukraine, and some officials told the outlet the United States doesn’t have a surplus of F-16s.
