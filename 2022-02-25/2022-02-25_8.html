     Amanda Bynes lobbies judge to end conservatorship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     GVK/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesFollowing Britney Spears being freed from her conservatorship, former Easy A star Amanda Bynes has reportedly lobbied a Los Angeles judge to end hers.
Bynes’ mother Lynn was put in charge of her affairs temporarily following a 2013 incident in which Bynes reportedly set fire to a driveway.
After the driveway incident, Bynes was placed on a psychiatric hold.
In 2014, Bynes revealed she’d been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
According to Page Six, Bynes requested this week that the Ventura County Superior Court in California terminate the conservatorship, and a hearing was scheduled for March 22 to reassess her heath records, which is a required first step.

     Amanda Bynes files petition to end conservatorship, has parents' support
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Actor Amanda Bynes is seeking to end her 9-year conservatorship, and she's doing so with her parents' approval.
Bynes filed a petition Wednesday at Ventura County Superior Court in California to terminate the conservatorship of her person and estate.
An attorney for Bynes' parents said they will not attend the virtual hearing but they support their daughter's decision and will agree to her request to end the conservatorship.
Bynes, 35, has been in a conservatorship under her parents, Lynn and Rick Bynes, since 2013 amid substance abuse issues, controversial Twitter rants, and legal troubles.
While living in the apartment community, Bynes underwent random toxicology screenings, weekly apartment checks and check-ins with her case manager.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Amanda Bynes is aiming to end her conservatorship after nearly nine years.
Bynes’s mother, Lynn Organ, was granted temporary conservatorship in 2013 after the actor allegedly set a driveway on fire and was hospitalized on an involuntary psychiatric hold.
Variety confirms that Bynes filed a petition on Feb. 23 to end her conservatorship.
Bynes’ assets are part of a separate trust overseen by her father, and are not subject to the conservatorship.
Bynes contends her condition has improved, and protection of the court is no longer necessary,” her attorney, David A. Esquibias, wrote.

     Amanda Bynes Wants to End Her Conservatorship, Too

According to “Page Six,” Bynes filed documents Wednesday asking the court to terminate the court-ordered conservatorship that has placed her under the control of her mother and legal guardian, Lynn Bynes, for almost nine years.
While Bynes regained control of her financial assets in 2017, her mother remains in charge of all personal decisions including her health care.
Bynes’s petition follows Britney Spears’s highly publicized mission to end her own restrictive conservatorship, which was finally lifted in November after 13 years.
Like Bynes, Spears had been put on a 5150 hold in 2008 before her conservatorship began.

Bynes filed court papers in Ventura County on February 22 asking the judge to end the conservatorship with the support of her mother, who is also her conservator.
“Amanda’s mother, Lynn, is so proud of her for all the hard work and progress Amanda has made, and she supports Amanda’s petition to terminate the conservatorship,” said Lynn’s attorney Tamar Arminak.
Now 35, Amanda has submitted to court her request to end it backed up by the reports and findings of professionals that the safeguard is no longer necessary and her mother agrees.
A hearing on Amanda’s request is set for March 22 in Ventura County court.
