     Miami Heat's Victor Oladipo could make season debut by second week of March
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There is optimism that Miami Heat guard Victor Oladipo could make his season debut within the next two weeks, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski on Friday.
Oladipo, ramping up after offseason quad tendon surgery, joined the Heat on their current six-game road trip and could be ready to play as soon as the second week of March, sources said.
Oladipo, who first had surgery on the quad tendon in January 2019, arrived in Miami in a March 2021 trade-deadline deal with the Houston Rockets and played four games before reinjuring the quad in April.
He has been rehabbing the injury since the second surgery was performed May 13.
Oladipo agreed to stay with the Heat in August on a one-year minimum deal.

Here's the official release from the NBA:"Miami Heat forward Jimmy Butler has been fined $25,000 for violating league rules governing media interview access and for his noncompliance with the resulting NBA investigation.
This results from Butler’s failure to comply with his media availability obligations during NBA All-Star 2022, including following the game on Sunday night."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Miami Heat are fighting for the top slot in the NBA’s Eastern Conference, only trailing the Chicago Bulls who took a half-game lead on Thursday while the Heat were dormant.
Miami Heat forward, Morris, and wing guy, Victor Oladipo, are traveling with the team.
Listen and for clarity, if he is 100 percent and the All-Star caliber player that he has been across his career, all the better for the Miami heat.
However, if he is just 65-70 percent of himself, that should be enough to help put the Miami Heat way over the top.
The Miami Heat have been rolling this season and getting these guys back should only add more steam to the engine.

     Tyler Herro Offsets Huge RJ Barrett Night In Miami Heat Win, 115-110
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Getting right to it, the Miami Heat would start the game slowly, allowing the Knicks to get out to a 10-0 run before they would score a basket.
The Miami Heat came into the Madison Square Garden on Friday for their first post-All-Star break game.
Still down 10 at the half, 65-55, and though the Miami Heat would allow them to get closer than they should have as the game churned to a finish, the Miami Heat would eventually shut the door on the struggling Knicks squad.
All in all, the massive night still wasn’t enough to help his team get the win, in Barrett’s case.
The Miami Heat started the second portion of the season off right and jumped back over Chicago in the seedings in the process.

     Kyle Lowry pops up out of nowhere to surprise Jimmy Butler in his postgame interview after the Heat's win over the Knicks.
(0:18)NEW YORK -- — Tyler Herro scored 25 points, Jimmy Butler had 23 and the Miami Heat overcame RJ Barrett's career-high 46 points to beat the New York Knicks 115-100 on Friday night.
“It makes it fun for us because everybody’s involved, we’re not depending on one person to get us 30 every night,” Adebayo said.
Knicks: Rookie Quentin Grimes left in the first quarter with right knee injury, the team saying it was a subluxation of the right patella.
Coach Tom Thibodeau said Rose was in discomfort but not pain, and there was no timetable for his return.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Miami Heat begins its post-All-Star break schedule on the road, but it will have plenty of time at home during the next few weeks.
Following Friday’s contest in New York, the Heat will play 15 of its final 22 regular-season games at FTX Arena as a well-earned reward after playing the second-most road games in the NBA (33) before the break.
Only the Orlando Magic played more road games (34) than Miami during that time.
This is good news for the Heat, which owns the fourth-best home record in the NBA this season at 19-7.
“We’ve been on the road for the first half of the season, long road road trips,” Heat guard Tyler Herro said.
