     'A Madea Homecoming' review: leaves little to celebrate about Madea’s return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tyler Perry’s latest offering for Netflix, A Madea Homecoming, brings the family together for a celebration.
For newcomers, it’s an introduction to an established ensemble in a way that doesn’t feel like it is leaving them out.
The primary storyline centers on Tim (Brandon Black) coming home to celebrate being valedictorian of his graduating class and sharing a secret with his family.
This is Perry’s lane — family secrets coming out into the open in ways where the impacted family member is ultimately surrounded by support.
Ultimately, Madea’s 12th movie outing is nothing new and raises the question of whether coming out of retirement was a good call.

     A Madea Homecoming review: Tyler Perry is back in the muumuu
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     No matter how many times Tyler Perry has tried to convince us that he’s done playing his most cherished creation—the gun-wielding, no-nonsense big momma Madea—you know you’ll see him rocking the glasses, gray wig, and floppy fat suit again.
Even though she’s a loudmouthed, foulmouthed caricature, a pistol-packing mammy, Madea has become a national treasure, and Perry knows it.
This time, it’s to celebrate the college graduation of her great-grandson, Tim (Brendan Black), who’s also the valedictorian.
Since this is a Tyler Perry movie, the resident bald-headed brotha that everyone hates is Tim’s dad (Amani Atkinson), whom Tim invited even though the family despises him for doing Laura dirty.
Davi also gets a surprise when his relatives—cousin Cathy (Jennifer Gibney) and grandma Agnes Brown (Brendan O’Carroll)—come over from Ireland to see him get his diploma.

     The ‘Mrs. Brown’s Boys’ Crossover In ‘A Madea Homecoming’ Makes Too Much Sense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Netflix’s A Madea Homecoming may be the twelfth movie in Tyler Perry‘s Madea franchise, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have something new to offer.
WHO IS MRS. BROWN IN A MADEA HOMECOMING?
Agnes Brown, aka Mrs. Brown, is a character created and played Irish comedian Brendan O’Carroll.
The crossover in Madea Homecoming couldn’t be more appropriate, considering both Madea and Agnes Brown are rude, older women played by male comedians in drag.
“He started doing Mrs. Brown and I started doing Madea and we were in different parts of the world.

     ‘A Madea Homecoming’ Review: The Fastest, Funniest Tyler Perry Movie in a While
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The first Tyler Perry movie, “Diary of a Mad Black Woman” (which included an appearance by Madea), was released 17 years ago today.
Actually, it’s the fastest, funniest “Madea” movie in quite some time.
In “A Madea Homecoming,” Madea, the pious and not-so-secretly anarchic church lady in her gray hair and gaudy flowered dresses, is still, in her old-school way, an outlaw, a pothead matriarch with a shady past who prides herself on living outside the system.
“A Madea Homecoming” is here’s-what-happened-to-the-’70s-inner-city comedy that turns into an earnest coming-out story with maybe one or two more secrets than it can bear.
But it’s a Tyler Perry movie, so you roll with it.
