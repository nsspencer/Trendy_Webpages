     Ukraine Invasion Makes Finland Ponder NATO Membership
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin said on Thursday that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would lead to a significant shift in the debate over Finland’s potential participation in NATO.
“Finland is not currently facing an immediate military threat, but it is also now clear that the debate on NATO membership in Finland will change,” Marin said, according to Finland’s YLE news outlet.
She added, however, that a potential Finnish accession to NATO would require the broad support of Finns, who have historically been skeptical of the military alliance.
Finland maintained its independent position throughout the Cold War, sometimes serving as a neutral ground between the United States and the Soviet Union.
A key Russian demand in the run-up to the conflict was for NATO to publicly commit to end its expansion and disavow future Ukrainian membership.

“I think Putin’s aggressive behavior and bullying threats will soon push Sweden and Finland to join the Alliance.
