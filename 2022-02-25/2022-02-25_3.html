     James Wiseman assigned to Santa Cruz Warriors, to practice Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Gabrielle Lurie / The ChroniclePORTLAND, Ore. — The Golden State Warriors have assigned second-year center James Wiseman to the team's G-Leage affiliate in Santa Cruz, the team announced on Friday.
Wiseman, 20, will practice with the team today in Santa Cruz.
He underwent successful surgery to repair a right meniscus tear on April 15.
He had been previously assigned to short stints in Santa Cruz this season on Nov. 28 and Dec. 11.
He required an additional arthroscopic procedure in December to relieve swelling, which delayed his highly anticipated return to action.

     Here's What Steve Kerr Said After The Warriors Beat The Trail Blazers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Golden State Warriors crushed the Portland Trail Blazers 132-95 on Thursday evening in their first game back from the All-Star break.
The win improved them to 43-17 in 60 games played on the season, and they are currently the second seed in the Western Conference.
After the game, head coach Steve Kerr spoke to reporters, and a clip of what he said can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Warriors on NBCS.
The Warriors have missed the playoffs in each of the last two seasons (Klay Thompson also missed the last two seasons to injury), but that appears likely to change this year.
They look like one of the legitimate contenders to win the NBA Championship this summer.

     Jacked Ramsays Post Game: Blazers vs Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Portland Trail Blazers’ winning streak ends at four games as they fall 132-95 to the Golden State Warriors on what figures to be an interesting final stretch to the 2021-22 NBA season.
The “Baby Blazers” group of Anfernee Simons, Josh Hart and even Justise Winslow continue to play admirably - Simons in particular put up another star level effort that won’t even register as it becomes the norm - but the loss of Jusuf Nurkic for what will likely be the season and the shortage of top end talent to fill the gaps just proved to be too much for the Warriors who put eight players into double figures and saw Steph Curry post 18 points and an eye popping 14 assists.
Hop on with Danny Marang and Brandon Sprague as they take a look at tonight’s action, the debuts of Keon Johnson, Brandon Williams and Drew Eubanks and the upcoming schedule.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Warriors' second-year center was assigned to the team's G League affiliate on Friday, where he will participate in a practice with the Santa Cruz Warriors.
There was some speculation that Wiseman will play in the Sea Dubs' G League contest Saturday against the Birmingham Squadron, but The Athletic's Anthony Slater reported that Wiseman won't play in Saturday's game.
This is for a scrimmage/practice today, not tomorrowâs Santa Cruz game https://t.co/IpkGOUz3pv — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) February 25, 2022The No.
It is expected that Wiseman will play a few games for Santa Cruz before he makes his season debut for the big club.
After Saturday, the Sea Dubs play Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday of next week.

I don't need to be out there chasing threes, and I know I can get to the free-throw line easy.

"He's a beast when you look at him on the floor, especially with the rest of our team," Steph Curry said Thursday night.
Coach Steve Kerr said Wednesday night that Wiseman looked good during the scrimmage.
"He looked good," Curry said.

Here are my three big takeaways from the game:Shapeshifting StephThe Warriors didn’t need Steph Curry to repeat his spellbinding, 50-point All-Star Game performance on Thursday night.
Curry did something we haven’t seen of him too often over the last few seasons — he was a point guard.
Yes, the competition afforded the Warriors some room to experiment, and it was interesting to see what Curry did with the space.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James Wiseman’s anticipated return to the court inched closer to reality with the team announcing that the Warriors’ 7-footer was assigned to practice with the G-League Santa Cruz Warriors on Friday.
Wiseman, 20, is expected to participate and scrimmage with the Santa Cruz team and is not expected to play Saturday’s game against the Birmingham Squadron.
Wiseman participated in a 5-on-5 scrimmage on Wednesday and the Tuesday before the All-Star break, shortly after participating in 3-on-3 contact work the week prior.
“It felt like a huge step,” Wiseman said last Wednesday, the first time he addressed media since his surgery.
He had a good All-Star break.
