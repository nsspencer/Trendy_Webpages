     Kendall Jenner Debuts Major Hair Transformation, Dyes Hair Red — See Photos

     New pics of the model and reality star reveal that she may have made a huge change to her look and gone red.
To add fuel to the fire, Kendall posted an Instagram Story snapshot of herself in the hairstylist's chair.
Her hair color?
An unmistakably different shade from what we're used to.
In the pic, Kenny's hair doesn't appear quite as bright during the Prada show, but it was definitely lighter than Kendall's go-to dark hue.

     Kendall Jenner Debuts a Dramatic New Hair Color on the Prada Runway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As if you needed more proof that copper is the hair color of the moment, today Kendall Jenner unveiled a new shocking red dye job on the Prada runway in Milan.
The 26-year-old model’s freshly dyed red lengths were worn in a sleek, sculptural chignon crafted by Guido Palau above a black plume-embellished coat and sheer gray slip skirt look.
Photo: Courtesy of Guido Palau / @guidopalauIt’s not the first time Jenner has traded in her natural glossy brunette for a transformative new shade—or catapulted it into the spotlight on the catwalk.
Being the trend-setter that she is, Jenner’s new auburn will naturally add proverbial fuel to the fire that is the current obsession with red hair.
Gird your loins for the double-process dye job accordingly.

     Kendall Jenner Walked The Prada AW22 Show With Red Hair
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This season, it seems Kendall Jenner has succumbed to the winds of change and decided to try out one of the most popular shades of the season, debuting a new copper-toned hair colour at the Prada autumn/winter 2022 show.
The 26-year-old model took to the catwalk in Milan sporting a sleek and lacquered sky-scraping chignon, a look masterminded by the runway's favoured hair stylist, Guido Palau.
Victor VIRGILE Getty ImagesPietro S. D'Aprano Getty ImagesFor those interested in trying a copper shade for yourself, it's imperative to speak to your hair stylist who can advise you on what you can realistically achieve with your current hair shade.
For a lighter red hue such as Jenner's, darker hair tones would have to first be lightened with bleach in order to get the most natural-looking finish.
Always remember to show up to your appointment prepared with image references; giving your hair stylist visuals will allow you to both understand what you want to achieve and save you from disappointment with the outcome.

     Kendall Jenner is so many things.
For her latest editorial spread, a cover feature for i-D magazine, Jenner rocked a short, shaggy hairstyle in a tone that fell somewhere between strawberry-blonde and orange.
Before sharing a throwback photo of a behind-the-scenes moment from her i-D shoot (shout out to the In-N-Out soda cup), Jenner shared another image of what appears to be her actual hair being styled by professionals.
Instagram:@kendalljennerStill, it does appear that Jenner went red for another gig as opposed to making a more personal choice.
On February 24, Jenner walked the runway for a Prada fashion show in Milan.
