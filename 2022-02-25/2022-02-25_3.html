     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced guideline changes allowing most Americans to unmask indoors, which health experts say may be the first step in shifting the U.S. to an “endemic phase” of the pandemic.
The new metrics would put more than half of U.S. counties – where more than 70% of Americans live – in areas of low or medium risk, according to the CDC data.
However, the CDC says schools are included in the public settings where masking and testing may not be necessary if the COVID-19 risk is low based on the new metrics.
Some health experts worry the new metrics could lead to a rise in cases and hospitalizations.

     CDC relaxes mask guidelines, removes recommendation for low-risk areas like NYC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxed its mask guidelines Friday — scrapping the recommendation for areas currently including New York City — as the agency acknowledged the risk of severe COVID-19 cases has gone down.
Wearing a mask is no longer recommended in indoor public spaces, including schools, in low-risk areas, currently including New York City and much of upstate, the CDC said.
Masking up is still advised in high risk communities, and people in areas of medium risk should consider wearing them, the CDC said.
Kathy Hochul also refused earlier this month to scrap indoor mask mandates in schools.

     CDC says Americans can now go unmasked in many parts of the country
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The CDC recommends continued mask use in communities where serious cases of COVID-19 are straining the health system.
"We want to give people a break from things like mask-wearing," said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky at a news briefing Friday.
Health officials emphasized that people should still wear face coverings if they wish or if they are personally at high risk.
Under the CDC's new risk metrics, an area is deemed "high" risk if it has concerning levels of COVID-19 hospital admissions and hospital capacity taken up by COVID-19 patients.
The CDC will release county-by-county risk levels weekly on its website, officials said.

About 37.3% of U.S. counties currently have high Covid levels, 39.6% have medium levels and 23% have low levels, CDC officials said.
Previously, CDC guidelines recommended masking for people over 2 who are not up to date on vaccinations or who are in areas with “substantial or high” Covid transmission.
However, many people choose cloth masks over respirator masks because cloth masks are more comfortable, a University of Virginia research team found.
TangentThe CDC’s decision to ease masking guidelines came weeks after California, New Jersey, Oregon and other states announced they would drop state mask mandates or school mask mandates.

     New CDC Covid-19 metrics drop strong mask recommendations for most of the country
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Now, the CDC's "Covid-19 community level" metrics are based on three pieces of data in a community: new Covid-19 hospitalizations, hospital capacity and new Covid-19 cases.
The CDC's website includes a list of US counties and their current Covid-19 levels.
Under the updated guidance, more than 70% of the US population is in a location with low or medium Covid-19 community levels.
In areas with "low" Covid-19 community levels, there is no recommendation for mask wearing.
"The Covid-19 community level we are releasing today will inform CDC recommendations on prevention measures, like masking, and CDC recommendations for layered prevention measures will depend on the Covid-19 level in the community," Walensky said.
