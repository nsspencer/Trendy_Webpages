     ‘Tyler Perry’s A Madea Homecoming’ Review: Tyler’s Hard Lemonade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Midway through “Tyler Perry’s A Madea Homecoming,” there’s a gag that captures the humor of Perry’s multimedia Madea franchise.
As proof, Madea brandishes a photo she took in the moment on her smartphone.
Perry, who claimed that he would retire his signature character after 2019’s “A Madea Family Funeral,” has resurrected Madea, it seems, in that same spirit: simply because he can.
This installment finds Madea hosting her great-grandson’s (Brandon Black) college graduation party.
The event is really a pretext for a dozen family members to bust each other’s chops; to cackle when Mr. Brown (David Mann) sets himself on fire.

     A Madea Homecoming review: Tyler Perry is back in the muumuu
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     No matter how many times Tyler Perry has tried to convince us that he’s done playing his most cherished creation—the gun-wielding, no-nonsense big momma Madea—you know you’ll see him rocking the glasses, gray wig, and floppy fat suit again.
Even though she’s a loudmouthed, foulmouthed caricature, a pistol-packing mammy, Madea has become a national treasure, and Perry knows it.
This time, it’s to celebrate the college graduation of her great-grandson, Tim (Brendan Black), who’s also the valedictorian.
Since this is a Tyler Perry movie, the resident bald-headed brotha that everyone hates is Tim’s dad (Amani Atkinson), whom Tim invited even though the family despises him for doing Laura dirty.
Davi also gets a surprise when his relatives—cousin Cathy (Jennifer Gibney) and grandma Agnes Brown (Brendan O’Carroll)—come over from Ireland to see him get his diploma.

     Tyler Perry’s A Madea Homecoming Reviews Are Here, See What Critics Are Saying About The Netflix Movie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After retiring the classic character in 2019, Tyler Perry has brought her back for A Madea Homecoming on Netflix.
Tyler Perry told audiences to “get ready,” as A Madea Homecoming features the extended family all coming together for the title character's great-grandson’s college graduation.
Alonso Duralde of The Wrap says Tyler Perry’s A Madea Homecoming is perhaps Perry’s best movie yet, which is helped by the fact that it’s not under PG-13 restraints.
With “A Madea Homecoming,” Perry has — probably for the first time since “Madea’s Big Happy Family” –created a vehicle that lets Madea be Madea.
A Madea Homecoming may not break the mold too much, but if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, right?

     ‘A Madea Homecoming’ Review: The Fastest, Funniest Tyler Perry Movie in a While
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The first Tyler Perry movie, “Diary of a Mad Black Woman” (which included an appearance by Madea), was released 17 years ago today.
Actually, it’s the fastest, funniest “Madea” movie in quite some time.
In “A Madea Homecoming,” Madea, the pious and not-so-secretly anarchic church lady in her gray hair and gaudy flowered dresses, is still, in her old-school way, an outlaw, a pothead matriarch with a shady past who prides herself on living outside the system.
“A Madea Homecoming” is here’s-what-happened-to-the-’70s-inner-city comedy that turns into an earnest coming-out story with maybe one or two more secrets than it can bear.
But it’s a Tyler Perry movie, so you roll with it.
