     Bill Paxton's Family Reaches $1 Million Settlement Over Wrongful Death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Terminator, Aliens, and Titanic actor Bill Paxton unexpectedly died in 2017 at just 61 years old.
His death came shortly after he underwent open-heart surgery to repair a damaged aortic valve, followed by a second emergency surgery on a damaged coronary artery.
In 2018 Paxton’s family filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the surgeon who performed the operation.
Now, Deadline is reporting that one of the defendants has settled and will pay his family $1 million.
Whether those parties will also settle remains to be seen, though this development indicates that the Paxton family’s case is solid and that they have a good chance of victory.

     American actor Bill Paxton's family will receive $1million in a partial settlement in the wrongful death/negligence suit filed following the actor's death in 2017 against an anesthesiologist medical group.
Court documents submitted to the Los Angeles Superior Courton Wednesday revealed that attorneys for co-defendants General Anesthesia Specialists Partnership are seeking approval of a settlement of $1 million between Paxton’s family and the company.
The agency was involved in Paxton’s heart surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles less than two weeks before his death on February 25, 2017, at the age of 61.
Meanwhile, the remainder of the 2018 lawsuit filed by Paxton’s widow Louise Paxton and their children, James and Lydia Paxton, is scheduled for September 19.
