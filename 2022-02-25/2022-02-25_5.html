     Lakers: Austin Reaves Expected to See Expanded Role in A Very Odd Starting Lineup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Lakers also continue to play without Kendrick Nunn, who has yet to make a debut this season.
Austin Reaves will get the first start of his NBA career and is expected to play an expanded role.
It's the way that Reaves plays the game that has drawn the adoration of the Lakers and their fans.
He always seems to end up in the right place and fully embraces the role they have for him on the court.
You can also expect to see Malik Monk with a larger role again as the Lakers lean on their shooters.

     LeBron James’s agent met with Lakers to dispel rumors of change in franchise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “I’m not saying I’m coming back and playing, I don’t know.
I don’t even know when I’m free.”James, in fact, will be a free agent in the summer of 2023.
Per Wojnarowski, changes to the roster and the future of franchise are things that will be discussed more at the conclusion of the season.
James’s recent comments—which included a rumored return to Cleveland and applauding Thunder general manager Sam Presti—stemmed from Pelinka not making any changes to the Lakers current roster at the NBA trade deadline.
Like LeBron, Wall is also a Klutch Sports client, and a trade out of Houston would have relieved Wall from an implausible situation with the team.

A very upset Lakers coach Frank Vogel called the decisions “B.S.” — his issue with a final-minute review that took the ball from the Lakers with a chance to lead and gave it to the Clippers.
It is what it is.”After two Clippers free throws, the Lakers had another chance, but James’ potential game-tying three didn’t fall.

     The Clippers also moved one game ahead of the Lakers in the loss column while clinching the season series victory in this local derby.
“When we got down five or six, we just kept our composure, kept our poise and kept playing,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said.
After two lengthy replay reviews, the Clippers committed an 8-second violation with 17.8 seconds left, but Anthony missed a 3-pointer from well behind the line with 4 seconds to play.
The first review left Lakers coach Frank Vogel steamed by the decision that James had been out of bounds on the baseline.

     Sources -- LeBron James' agent meets with Los Angeles Lakers, denies any push to shake up front office
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kendrick Perkins explains why he doesn't see the Lakers making it past the first round of the playoffs this season.
After Pelinka resisted making any deals at the trade deadline, James' own public comments -- raising the possibility of a return to Cleveland and praising Oklahoma City Thunder GM Sam Presti -- started to fuel speculation that he could leave in free agency in 2023.
Paul has privately downplayed that possibility, and told the Lakers that James is committed to playing his part in helping the Lakers become championship contenders again, sources said.
The Lakers dropped to 27-32 with Friday's loss to the Clippers, ninth in the Western Conference and playing without Davis for what sources told ESPN are likely another four to five weeks with a right mid-foot sprain.
The Lakers believe they'll have the expiring contract of guard Russell Westbrook ($47.1 million), Talen Horton-Tucker and first-round picks in 2027 and 2029 to use in trades.
