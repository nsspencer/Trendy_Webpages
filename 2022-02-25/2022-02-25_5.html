     After Ukraine, Russia threatens Finland on NATO membership

Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said during a weekly briefing that a Finnish addition to NATO could have "detrimental consequences."
Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin said on Thursday that the debate within Finland on NATO membership "will change" following the start of a war in Ukraine.

     Ukraine Invasion Makes Finland Ponder NATO Membership
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin said on Thursday that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would lead to a significant shift in the debate over Finland’s potential participation in NATO.
“Finland is not currently facing an immediate military threat, but it is also now clear that the debate on NATO membership in Finland will change,” Marin said, according to Finland’s YLE news outlet.
She added, however, that a potential Finnish accession to NATO would require the broad support of Finns, who have historically been skeptical of the military alliance.
Finland maintained its independent position throughout the Cold War, sometimes serving as a neutral ground between the United States and the Soviet Union.
A key Russian demand in the run-up to the conflict was for NATO to publicly commit to end its expansion and disavow future Ukrainian membership.

     A spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry has warned that the accession of either Finland or Sweden to the defence alliance Nato would spark a serious response from Moscow.
Maria Zakharova threatened if either Nordic country sought to join the security alliance it "would have serious military and political consequences that would require our country to take reciprocal steps", BBC reported quoting Russian news agencies.

Last month, Prime Minister Sanna Marin said it was "very unlikely" that Finland would apply for Nato membership during her term in office.

     Russia threatened “military and political consequences” against Finland and Sweden on Friday if they attempted to join NATO.
Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned against other countries attempting to join NATO after Russia started a war with Ukraine Thursday.
“Finland and Sweden should not base their security on damaging the security of other countries and their accession to NATO can have detrimental consequences and face some military and political consequences,” Zakharova said in a viral clip of a press conference.
Finland and Sweden have given significant military and humanitarian support to Ukraine since Russia invaded.
Russia and Ukraine are both sending delegations to Belarus to discuss Ukraine potentially adopting a nonaligned status with NATO.
