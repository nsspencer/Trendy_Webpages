    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s been a strong first half of the season for the Golden State Warriors.
The Golden State Warriors are going to have decisions to make this offseason, and one will be who they opt to re-sign.
Golden State has had many injuries along the way this season.
Several key injuries have been to players like James Wiseman, who has yet to play this season, forward Andre Iguodala, and four-time All-Star forward Draymond Green.
As Golden State attempts to continue their reign as a top-tier threat in the Western Conference, the Warriors will want to make sure these role players return next season.

     James Wiseman assigned to Santa Cruz Warriors, to practice Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Gabrielle Lurie / The ChroniclePORTLAND, Ore. — The Golden State Warriors have assigned second-year center James Wiseman to the team's G-Leage affiliate in Santa Cruz, the team announced on Friday.
Wiseman, 20, will practice with the team today in Santa Cruz.
He underwent successful surgery to repair a right meniscus tear on April 15.
He had been previously assigned to short stints in Santa Cruz this season on Nov. 28 and Dec. 11.
He required an additional arthroscopic procedure in December to relieve swelling, which delayed his highly anticipated return to action.

     “Jon (Kuminga) is one of the best athletes I’ve ever seen at his age,” Thompson told ClutchPoints.
Seems like he has close to a 40-inch vertical and is incredibly strong and you saw that tonight.
Usually younger players have to develop physically, but this Warriors rookie has it all physically.
Everyone knew Kuminga had the potential to be special, but not even the Warriors knew he would be ready this fast.
The Warriors improved their record to 43-17, giving them a 2.5-game lead over the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference standings.

He’s in the final stages before returning to the court and has everyone excited, including superstar Stephen Curry.
After the Warriors blew out the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday, Curry talked about how Wiseman looked in their team scrimmages.

     Warrior Steph Curry Calls Former No. 2 Pick a ‘Beast’ as Return Nears
    </h2>

     As if the long buildup to James Wiseman’s return hadn’t garnered enough anticipation already, Golden State Warriors teammate Steph Curry helped matters with a rather glowing assessment of the 20-year-old center.
Wiseman had originally been slated to return much earlier in the season, but suffered a setback that led to another surgery in December.
Now cleared for contact work and participating in scrimmages, Wiseman’s return could be just days away, and Curry gave Warriors fans a preview of what to expect when he’s back.
“He’s a beast when you look at him on the floor, especially with the rest of our team,” Curry said, via Dalton Johnson of NBC Sports Bay Area.

But now the team wants to add their 7-foot young center, with some serious bounce and high-upside to the concoction?
If everything goes right, the Warriors could be the greatest NBA team of all time, all over again.

     Curry confessed it was a “dumb read.”That’s the kind of incongruity Golden State has shown throughout the season.
In that game against the Nuggets, Curry loomed at the top of the key midway through the second quarter.
Golden State has been without former All-Stars Draymond Green and Iguodala, as well as promising young center James Wiseman.
Early in the first quarter against the Nuggets, Curry drove on a pick-and-roll with Kevon Looney.
Previously, he covered Montana State football at the Bozeman Daily Chronicle and worked at newspapers in his home state of North Dakota.

     On Jan. 23, Stephen Curry dished out six assists against one turnover in a two-point win over the Jazz.
Over his last five games, Curry has 40 assists to 14 turnovers.
When his energy is high as a passer, whether he's actually hitting shots becomes even less relevant to his impact.
Curry is a different passer with Thompson on the court, like a quarterback with his top target back from a long absence.
Over his last seven games, all in February, Thompson is shooting 46 percent from 3 on over eight attempts per game.
