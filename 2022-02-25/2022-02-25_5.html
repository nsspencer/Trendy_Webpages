     Lakers: Austin Reaves Expected to See Expanded Role in A Very Odd Starting Lineup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Lakers also continue to play without Kendrick Nunn, who has yet to make a debut this season.
Austin Reaves will get the first start of his NBA career and is expected to play an expanded role.
It's the way that Reaves plays the game that has drawn the adoration of the Lakers and their fans.
He always seems to end up in the right place and fully embraces the role they have for him on the court.
You can also expect to see Malik Monk with a larger role again as the Lakers lean on their shooters.

     LeBron James’s agent met with Lakers to dispel rumors of change in franchise

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “I’m not saying I’m coming back and playing, I don’t know.
I don’t even know when I’m free.”James, in fact, will be a free agent in the summer of 2023.
Per Wojnarowski, changes to the roster and the future of franchise are things that will be discussed more at the conclusion of the season.
James’s recent comments—which included a rumored return to Cleveland and applauding Thunder general manager Sam Presti—stemmed from Pelinka not making any changes to the Lakers current roster at the NBA trade deadline.
Like LeBron, Wall is also a Klutch Sports client, and a trade out of Houston would have relieved Wall from an implausible situation with the team.

     Lakers Rumors: Rich Paul Met With Jeanie Buss &amp; Rob Pelinka To Address LeBron James Speculation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Los Angeles Lakers enter play against the L.A. Clippers a disappointing 27-31 and in ninth place of the Western Conference.
Friday’s matchup is the Lakers’ first game out of the All-Star break, which was dominated by speculation involving LeBron James.
After voicing his admiration for Los Angeles Rams general manager Les Snead parting with draft picks in pursuit of winning in the present, James raved about Oklahoma City Thunder general manager Sam Presti.
James further fueled speculation of a rift when acknowledging he would be open to another return to his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers.
Paul previously addressed he matter publicly — albeit indirectly — by going on the record with Shams Charania to refute reports of a rift between the Lakers and James.

     Sources: LeBron James' agent meets with Los Angeles Lakers, denies any push to shake up front office
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Paul -- whose agency represents stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis -- made it clear that James' primary objective is remaining a Laker and the goal now ought to be to finish the season as strong as possible and then regroup in the offseason and work on ways to improve the team, sources said.
After Pelinka resisted making any deals at the trade deadline, James' own public comments -- raising the possibility of a return to Cleveland and praising Oklahoma City Thunder GM Sam Presti -- started to fuel speculation that he could leave in free agency in 2023.
Paul has privately downplayed that possibility, and told the Lakers that James is committed to playing his part in helping the Lakers become championship contenders again, sources said.
The Lakers dropped to 27-32 with Friday's loss to the Clippers, ninth in the Western Conference and playing without Davis for what sources told ESPN are likely another four to five weeks with a right mid-foot sprain.
The Lakers believe they'll have the expiring contract of guard Russell Westbrook ($47.1 million), Talen Horton-Tucker and first-round picks in 2027 and 2029 to use in trades.

     The Lakers (27-31) face the Clippers (30-31) on Friday evening for a Purple and Gold home game, as the players return from the All-Star break.
Avery Bradley, on the other hand, missed the last game before the break (Feb. 16 win vs. Utah) with right knee effusion (swelling), and will be out once again.
Kendrick Nunn, who has yet to play this season, will continue to be out, though he did ramp up activity in Thursday’s practice.
LAST TWO MATCHUPSThe Lakers and Clippers have met twice this season.
Both games came down to the final moments, and the Clippers found a way to win each time.

     For approximately two hours on Tuesday, the most influential people in LeBron James’ Lakers life sat inside the business offices of the team’s practice facility in El Segundo, Calif., and tried to accomplish one shared goal: Clearing the air after reports of rising tensions and power plays had dominated the NBA news cycle of late.It was his agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, Lakers owner Jeanie Buss and general manager Rob Pelinka in attendance.
And as Paul explained to The Athletic not long after ESPN first reported about the meeting on Friday, it was high time they all got in a room to figure a few things out.There had been more than two weeks of perceived strife between the two sides, from the Feb. 9 loss to Milwaukee that sparked multiple reports about player frustration with the roster to James’ interview with The Athletic at All-Star weekend in which his choice to discuss a possible return to Cleveland sparked questions about whether he was still happy in Laker Land.
In between, with the Lakers’ choice to stand pat at the trade deadline upping the decibel level on this debate, there were myriad messages coming from James that were widely seen as passive-aggressive signs of his discontent.But Paul strongly refuted the notion that there is any sort of divide between James and the Lakers, or that these were all signs of a grand exit plan that’s yet to come.
And when the meeting was all done, one in which Paul said some of the time was even spent “laughing and catching up,” he says they all found themselves in a more productive, peaceful place.“I just don’t think (communicating indirectly) is the right way of doing business,” Paul, who also represents the Lakers’ Anthony Davis, told The Athletic.
“And I don’t think that’s who we are, who LeBron is.
