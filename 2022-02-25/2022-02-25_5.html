     Art Briles Refuses To Go Away
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Six years after he was fired by Baylor University for his role in the creation of a football program that became synonymous with sexual assault, Art Briles is finally returning to a college sideline.
Grambling State announced on Thursday that Briles, who was head coach of the Baylor Bears from 2008 to 2016, has been hired as the team’s offensive coordinator.
An investigation into Baylor’s institutional failure to prevent these assaults, the full findings of which were never made public, resulted in Briles being fired.
That Briles is returning to the ranks of college coaching now, all these years later, speaks to his steadfast refusal to accept that the sport is better off without him.
The lengthy, labyrinthine path that Briles has followed back to college football is evidence of how little interest he has ever had in accepting the consequences of his own actions.

     Former Baylor coach Art Briles vowed to earn trust as Grambling State's offensive coordinator, after his de facto banishment from college football ended with him being hired Thursday.
"I’ve coached over 40 years and the word trust is thrown around a bunch," Briles told KTAL-TV.
"It’s the hardest thing to get anybody to do, regardless of the situation, regardless of the environment, regardless of the profession."
"You know, you report what you know, we did the best we felt at the time," Briles told KTAL-TV.

On Thursday, Williams told the Washington Post he's "not a fan at all" of Briles becoming the offensive coordinator at Grambling.
On Thursday, a Grambling representative confirmed Art Briles' hire with me and then confirmed that there would be "no press release," only at "KTAL exclusive interview."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (AP) — Grambling State football coach Hue Jackson has hired disgraced former Baylor coach Art Briles as offensive coordinator, the university confirmed Thursday.
Before his time at Baylor, Briles coached at Houston from 2003-2007.
At Grambling, Briles takes over for Ted White, who left to join the NFL’s Houston Texans.
Briles coached briefly in Italy and then at a Texas high school in Mount Vernon.
And then you have the opportunity to gain some trust,” Briles said in his TV interview.

     If Hue Jackson cared about HBCUs, he wouldn’t have hired Art Briles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     And now Hue Jackson — a man with an 11-44 record as an NFL head coach — has hired Art Briles, a serial rape enabler, to his staff at Grambling State University — arguably the most historic program in all of HBCU football.
“I’ve gotten to know coach Briles, and he’s a tremendous offensive-minded football coach,’’ Jackson said about Briles in 2016.
In 2019, a sorority graduate adviser who was also the executive assistant to the president at Fort Valley State University was indicted in a prostitution ring.
Nothing positive can come from this as HBCUs are trying to clean up their campuses when someone with Briles’ reputation and past gets hired.
AdvertisementWhen Hue Jackson was hired at Grambling he said he planned to stay “until they kick me out.” I hope he meant that.

     Why Grambling's hire of Art Briles is an insult of irreducible proportions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This thanks to Hue Jackson, the former NFL head coach and offensive coach who became Grambling’s 14th head coach last December.
The Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League tried to hire Briles in 2017, but withdrew the offer after considerable backlash.
In 2019, former Southern Miss head coach Jay Hopson tried to hire Briles as his offensive coordinator, but university president Rodney Bennett overruled the hire.
Briles’ offensive genius is the obvious reason why — Jackson clearly wants the best guy on his staff, and perhaps from a schematic perspective, Briles is that guy.
Doug Williams, who was Grambling’s head coach from 1998 through 2003, and from 2011 through 2013, may have put it best.
