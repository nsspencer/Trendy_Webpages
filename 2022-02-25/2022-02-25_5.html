     LeBron James’s agent met with Lakers to dispel rumors of change in franchise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “I’m not saying I’m coming back and playing, I don’t know.
I don’t even know when I’m free.”James, in fact, will be a free agent in the summer of 2023.
Per Wojnarowski, changes to the roster and the future of franchise are things that will be discussed more at the conclusion of the season.
James’s recent comments—which included a rumored return to Cleveland and applauding Thunder general manager Sam Presti—stemmed from Pelinka not making any changes to the Lakers current roster at the NBA trade deadline.
Like LeBron, Wall is also a Klutch Sports client, and a trade out of Houston would have relieved Wall from an implausible situation with the team.

     The Lakers also continue to play without Kendrick Nunn, who has yet to make a debut this season.
Austin Reaves will get the first start of his NBA career and is expected to play an expanded role.
It's the way that Reaves plays the game that has drawn the adoration of the Lakers and their fans.
He always seems to end up in the right place and fully embraces the role they have for him on the court.
You can also expect to see Malik Monk with a larger role again as the Lakers lean on their shooters.

     The Clippers also moved one game ahead of the Lakers in the loss column while clinching the season series victory in this local derby.
“When we got down five or six, we just kept our composure, kept our poise and kept playing,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said.
After two lengthy replay reviews, the Clippers committed an 8-second violation with 17.8 seconds left, but Anthony missed a 3-pointer from well behind the line with 4 seconds to play.
The first review left Lakers coach Frank Vogel steamed by the decision that James had been out of bounds on the baseline.

First, James said his comments to the Athletic were more open ended, that he could possibly retire with the Cleveland Cavaliers on some sort of ceremonial basis.
“They ask for my opinion and I voice my opinion and what I believe,” James said of the organization for which he plays.
Asked if he believed the Lakers’ front office could construct a winner around him, James offered support.

I'm here," James said after the Lakers' 105-102 loss to the LA Clippers.
James also said he wanted to make it clear that his role with the Lakers is that of a player.
Well, how is that directed at Rob and the Lakers franchise?

A very upset Lakers coach Frank Vogel called the decisions “B.S.” — his issue with a final-minute review that took the ball from the Lakers with a chance to lead and gave it to the Clippers.
It is what it is.”After two Clippers free throws, the Lakers had another chance, but James’ potential game-tying three didn’t fall.

     Inside the meeting between Rich Paul and Lakers brass to clear the air about LeBron
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For approximately two hours on Tuesday, the most influential people in LeBron James’ Lakers life sat inside the business offices of the team’s practice facility in El Segundo, Calif., and tried to accomplish one shared goal: Clearing the air after reports of rising tensions and power plays had dominated the NBA news cycle of late.It was his agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, Lakers owner Jeanie Buss and general manager Rob Pelinka in attendance.
And as Paul explained to The Athletic not long after ESPN first reported about the meeting on Friday, it was high time they all got in a room to figure a few things out.There had been more than two weeks of perceived strife between the two sides, from the Feb. 9 loss to Milwaukee that sparked multiple reports about player frustration with the roster to James’ interview with The Athletic at All-Star weekend in which his choice to discuss a possible return to Cleveland sparked questions about whether he was still happy in Laker Land.
In between, with the Lakers’ choice to stand pat at the trade deadline upping the decibel level on this debate, there were myriad messages coming from James that were widely seen as passive-aggressive signs of his discontent.But Paul strongly refuted the notion that there is any sort of divide between James and the Lakers, or that these were all signs of a grand exit plan that’s yet to come.
And when the meeting was all done, one in which Paul said some of the time was even spent “laughing and catching up,” he says they all found themselves in a more productive, peaceful place.“I just don’t think (communicating indirectly) is the right way of doing business,” Paul, who also represents the Lakers’ Anthony Davis, told The Athletic.
“And I don’t think that’s who we are, who LeBron is.

     There are teams that, to this day, have never had a player as good as LeBron James is right now.
It's easy to forget this now, but the Lakers may well have been one LeBron James away from becoming the Sacramento Kings.
Instead, James made them a viable home for Anthony Davis, whom the Lakers paid a handsome price to acquire.
The Lakers, right now, might not have either.
The Lakers have LeBron James right now.
