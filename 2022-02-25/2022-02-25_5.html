     Where’s your Steam Deck preorder email? Valve explains

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Valve’s $400-and-up portable gaming PC the Steam Deck went on sale this morning... but you didn’t get an email from Valve, I’m guessing?
And if your reservation says “After Q2 2022,” Valve says stay tuned for “news soon.” Perhaps that means they’ll stop shipping weekly at that point?
Like I explain in my Steam Deck review, it’s basically an early access game console.
Got any more questions about the Steam Deck that aren’t addressed in the reviews?
Hit me up at sean@theverge.com and I’ll try to answer in an FAQ next week.

     Here's the official Steam Deck Dock in all its rendered finery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Audio player loading…This is essentially what the official Valve Steam Deck Dock is going to look like, though probably not exactly like it.
Still, along with the Dock tech specs Valve released with the original Deck reveal, we do know a fair bit about the upcoming Deck Dock.
So, what will the Deck Dock offer that other docks can't deliver to the Steam Deck?
Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Valve) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Valve) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Valve)Aside from a handy cradle, you also get a USB Type-A Gen3.1 port, two Type-A Gen2.0 ports, an ethernet port, one DisplayPort 1.4, and one HDMI 2.0 output.
The saddest fail for me, however, has been the fact that so far my Steam Deck won't play nicely with the Eve Spectrum ES07D03 and it's built-in Type-C dock.

     Valve Steam Deck Review: Glitchy but Promising
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Since then, I've amassed a vast library of games on Steam, the platform created by Valve; it's how most people play games on their computers.
I was intrigued when Valve announced the Steam Deck last year, a handheld portable gaming console that lets you play your PC games anywhere.
It means the software needs more work, but it also shows how committed Valve is to the Steam Deck.
Bulky MachinePhotograph: ValveI received the top-end Steam Deck that retails for $649, which includes a 512-gigabyte solid-state drive.
This Steam Deck is bulky, but not as heavy as I had imagined nor as uncomfortable to hold.

     The Steam Deck is my new favorite console
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Steam Deck has the greatest launch lineup everOut of the box, the Steam Deck connects to Steam and its thousands of games, including any you may have purchased over the past decade and a half in your Steam library.
But the Steam Deck isn’t quite a portable game console — it’s a portable gaming PC.
For better and worse, the Steam Deck is a PCYes, for a moment, the Steam Deck appeared to be everything I’d dreamt of.
“Ready but waiting to go live” is sort of the theme of the Steam Deck beyond Steam itself.
Steam Deck and the freedom to make the most of timeEven in this early stage, the Steam Deck already delivers what I want from a modern portable console.

     Steam Deck Surprised Me, in Ways Both Good and Bad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dan Ackerman/CNETThe Steam Deck is the latest high-profile attempt to do the near-impossible – make a great handheld gaming PC.
The full scope of feature-enhancing tweaks and hacks (or bugs and limitations) won't be apparent until the Steam Deck gets into more hands.
The Steam Deck is made by Valve, the company behind the hugely successful Steam online game store/platform.
Like those first-gen VR headsets, the Steam Deck requires an adventurous spirit and a love for fiddly workarounds.
Steam currently lists it as "playable" on Steam Deck, and indeed it was, even more so than I expected.

     Valve’s Steam Deck is exactly that—a portable device ergonomically similar to the Nintendo Switch that is capable of playing PC games.
Gaming Gaming Valve Steam Deck Valve Steam Deck What is it?
Another trick is for the Steam Deck to transform into a full-blown Linux machine with a desktop interface.
Steam Deck software: Unfinished but rapidly evolvingValve is rushing to fix bugs, add features, and improve the performance of its software before the Steam Deck lands in customers’ hands.
Within minutes, Portal 2 running on the Steam Deck appeared on my Sony Google TV via the Steam Link app.
