     Doug Williams offers candid thoughts on Art Briles being hired at Grambling State: 'I’m not a fan at all'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     One of the more eyebrow-raising hires this offseason in college football came when Grambling State hired Art Briles to be the program’s new offensive coordinator.
Now one of the most well-known Grambling players of all-time has weighed in.
The hire is the first in college football for Briles since Baylor fired him for his handling of sexual assault allegations against his players.
I don’t know why Grambling State had to go be the one to hire him, so I’m not a fan at all.”Briles denied that he was involved in a coverup at Baylor.
“Let me be clear: I did not cover up any sexual violence,” he wrote in an open letter in 2017.

     Art Briles Refuses To Go Away
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Six years after he was fired by Baylor University for his role in the creation of a football program that became synonymous with sexual assault, Art Briles is finally returning to a college sideline.
Grambling State announced on Thursday that Briles, who was head coach of the Baylor Bears from 2008 to 2016, has been hired as the team’s offensive coordinator.
An investigation into Baylor’s institutional failure to prevent these assaults, the full findings of which were never made public, resulted in Briles being fired.
That Briles is returning to the ranks of college coaching now, all these years later, speaks to his steadfast refusal to accept that the sport is better off without him.
The lengthy, labyrinthine path that Briles has followed back to college football is evidence of how little interest he has ever had in accepting the consequences of his own actions.

"It’s the hardest thing to get anybody to do, regardless of the situation, regardless of the environment, regardless of the profession."
"You know, you report what you know, we did the best we felt at the time," Briles told KTAL-TV.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (AP) — Grambling State football coach Hue Jackson has hired disgraced former Baylor coach Art Briles as offensive coordinator, the university confirmed Thursday.
Before his time at Baylor, Briles coached at Houston from 2003-2007.
At Grambling, Briles takes over for Ted White, who left to join the NFL’s Houston Texans.
Briles coached briefly in Italy and then at a Texas high school in Mount Vernon.
And then you have the opportunity to gain some trust,” Briles said in his TV interview.

What would the legend Eddie Robinson say about hiring Art Briles?
On Thursday, Williams told the Washington Post he's "not a fan at all" of Briles becoming the offensive coordinator at Grambling.
On Thursday, a Grambling representative confirmed Art Briles' hire with me and then confirmed that there would be "no press release," only at "KTAL exclusive interview."

     WATCH: Interview with Grambling State offensive coordinator Art Briles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (KMSS/KTAL) – KTAL Sports reporter Sam Rothman sat down with new Grambling State offensive coordinator Art Briles Thursday.
The 66-year-old hasn’t coached collegiately since being fired from Baylor University in 2016 after an investigation concluded that Briles and his staff ignored reports of sexual assault by Baylor football players.
Below is a transcript of the interview along with information from the NCAA and Baylor external investigations for added context.
A (Art Briles): Well, fortunately, the NCAA didn’t find any violations and Baylor’s general counsel did completely exonerate3 me and the rest of our staff also.
You have to earn that trust and that’s certainly what I’ll do on a daily basis at Grambling University.

     Why Grambling's hire of Art Briles is an insult of irreducible proportions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This thanks to Hue Jackson, the former NFL head coach and offensive coach who became Grambling’s 14th head coach last December.
The Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League tried to hire Briles in 2017, but withdrew the offer after considerable backlash.
In 2019, former Southern Miss head coach Jay Hopson tried to hire Briles as his offensive coordinator, but university president Rodney Bennett overruled the hire.
Briles’ offensive genius is the obvious reason why — Jackson clearly wants the best guy on his staff, and perhaps from a schematic perspective, Briles is that guy.
Doug Williams, who was Grambling’s head coach from 1998 through 2003, and from 2011 through 2013, may have put it best.
