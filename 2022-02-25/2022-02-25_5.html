     How loud is the Steam Deck?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Steam Deck is loud in the same way that any gaming laptop is loud.
If you've ever experienced a gaming laptop running a demanding title at full chat you'll recognise the turbine whine coming from the top of the Steam Deck.
When we're talking about how loud the Steam Deck is it probably helps to explain what we actually mean.
(Image credit: CD Projekt Red)But volume isn't the most important thing about noise; pitch is also a key component, and when we talk about whine the Steam Deck most definitely has it.
We'd always recommend picking up the best gaming headset to pair with your new gaming laptop, and I'm going to suggest the same is true for the Steam Deck.

     Valve Steam Deck Review: Glitchy but Promising
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Since then, I've amassed a vast library of games on Steam, the platform created by Valve; it's how most people play games on their computers.
I was intrigued when Valve announced the Steam Deck last year, a handheld portable gaming console that lets you play your PC games anywhere.
It means the software needs more work, but it also shows how committed Valve is to the Steam Deck.
Bulky MachinePhotograph: ValveI received the top-end Steam Deck that retails for $649, which includes a 512-gigabyte solid-state drive.
This Steam Deck is bulky, but not as heavy as I had imagined nor as uncomfortable to hold.

     The Steam Deck has the greatest launch lineup everOut of the box, the Steam Deck connects to Steam and its thousands of games, including any you may have purchased over the past decade and a half in your Steam library.
But the Steam Deck isn’t quite a portable game console — it’s a portable gaming PC.
For better and worse, the Steam Deck is a PCYes, for a moment, the Steam Deck appeared to be everything I’d dreamt of.
“Ready but waiting to go live” is sort of the theme of the Steam Deck beyond Steam itself.
Steam Deck and the freedom to make the most of timeEven in this early stage, the Steam Deck already delivers what I want from a modern portable console.

     Steam Deck review: it’s not ready
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Both of these things are true:First, I’m having more fun with the Steam Deck than any gadget I’ve tested in years.
That’s not the Steam Deck that exists today — and not just because the Steam Deck is an absolute chonk that can practically fit a Switch between its grips.
I downloaded Chrome and Slack and Discord and worked from the Steam Deck, writing this entire post for The Verge.
But if early access isn’t your beverage of choice, you might just want to wait for a Steam Deck 2.
So far, that’s the one part of the Steam Deck that’s largely working out, and I can only hope it’ll get better.

     Steam Deck Surprised Me, in Ways Both Good and Bad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dan Ackerman/CNETThe Steam Deck is the latest high-profile attempt to do the near-impossible – make a great handheld gaming PC.
The full scope of feature-enhancing tweaks and hacks (or bugs and limitations) won't be apparent until the Steam Deck gets into more hands.
The Steam Deck is made by Valve, the company behind the hugely successful Steam online game store/platform.
Like those first-gen VR headsets, the Steam Deck requires an adventurous spirit and a love for fiddly workarounds.
Steam currently lists it as "playable" on Steam Deck, and indeed it was, even more so than I expected.

     Valve’s Steam Deck is exactly that—a portable device ergonomically similar to the Nintendo Switch that is capable of playing PC games.

Another trick is for the Steam Deck to transform into a full-blown Linux machine with a desktop interface.
Steam Deck software: Unfinished but rapidly evolvingValve is rushing to fix bugs, add features, and improve the performance of its software before the Steam Deck lands in customers’ hands.
Within minutes, Portal 2 running on the Steam Deck appeared on my Sony Google TV via the Steam Link app.
