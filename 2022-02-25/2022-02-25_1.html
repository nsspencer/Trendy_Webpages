     Here's What Steph Curry Said About His Viral Pregame Outfit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Golden State Warriors defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 132-95 in Oregon on Thursday night, which was both team's first game back since the All-Star break.
Before the game, Steph Curry wore a pregame outfit that was going viral on social media.
After the game, the two-time MVP was asked about the outfit, and his answer can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Warriors on NBCS.
The Warriors advanced to 43-17 with the win, which currently has them as the second seed in the Western Conference.
The franchise have not been to the playoffs in each of the last two seasons, but that will likely change this year.

     How Stephen Curry's passing evolution could open up the Warriors' offense down the stretch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Jan. 23, Stephen Curry dished out six assists against one turnover in a two-point win over the Jazz.
It was a nod of frustration to the endless headlines maligning Curry's season-long shooting slump.
Over his last five games, Curry has 40 assists to 14 turnovers.
Curry's smoking-gun shooting display from the All-Star Game was not as present with just a 2-for-7 night from 3, but he put on a passing clinic.
There's a joy to Curry's passing in almost the same way there is with his shooting when he really starts feeling himself as an active creator.

Here are my three big takeaways from the game:Shapeshifting StephThe Warriors didn’t need Steph Curry to repeat his spellbinding, 50-point All-Star Game performance on Thursday night.
Yes, the competition afforded the Warriors some room to experiment, and it was interesting to see what Curry did with the space.

     The loading ramp adjacent to the Warriors' team bus was simply his runway.
So it was a good way to come back from the break and establish ourselves at both ends of the floor."
Golden State had 30 assists on 45 made field goals, improving to 21-1 when doing so.
Golden State has the seventh-toughest remaining schedule, with games against the Suns, Heat, Jazz and Bucks still to play.
But if Thursday's win is as any indication, Golden State appears to be right on track.
