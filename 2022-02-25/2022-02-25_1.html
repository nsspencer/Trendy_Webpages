     James Harden impresses in 76ers debut, Joel Embiid scores 34 in win vs. Timberwolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James Harden impressed in his Philadelphia 76ers debut, nearly registering a triple-double in the team's 133-102 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.
Harden finished the game with 27 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds.
Starring alongside the new Sixer was big man Joel Embiid, who logged his own double-double with 34 points and 10 rebounds.
Harden missed his last three games with Brooklyn with hamstring tightness, while Philadelphia opted to rest him through the All-Star break following the trade.
When speaking about his trade to the Sixers in his introductory news conference, Harden said Philadelphia was a "perfect fit."

     76ers’ Harden, Embiid show they can thrive together in duo’s debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     First and foremost, it was refreshing to see Harden whip around the perimeter and come off handoffs from his big man.
A committed Harden running that play should give the Sixers open look after open look.
Harden bringing back some of those early shot clock opportunities—with or without Embiid on the floor—should help juice the offense.
Essentially, the Wolves didn’t really have the personnel to attack Harden and Embiid in pick-and-rolls.
Although the Sixers’ hopes ultimately rest on how well Embiid and Harden play together, maximizing their effectiveness will often mean one of them playing without the other.

     Stephen A. Smith breaks down why James Harden's legacy is on the line if he doesn't make an NBA Finals appearance as member of the Philadelphia 76ers.
(2:12)MINNEAPOLIS -- As the Philadelphia 76ers prepare to finally see James Harden take the court in their uniform for the first time Friday night against the Minnesota Timberwolves, 76ers star Joel Embiid said Harden has been far different than the person he heard about before his arrival.
So I'm just excited for that to continue on the court and I think that's going to help us a lot."
We're talking about James Harden" -- he said the most important thing is everyone being aligned toward the same goal.
"It's great for us as a team," Embiid said.

     Through 3 QuartersThis game looks like it will end up very different from the tight one-point margin of the Minnesota Timberwolves' win over the Philadelphia 76ers in their previous head-to-head November of last year.
After three quarters it's looking more and more like Philadelphia's high-powered offense is just too much for the Timberwolves as Philadelphia lead 94-74.

     Harden makes 76ers debut in blowout win over Timberwolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Harden had 27 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds in his 76ers debut, Joel Embiid added 34 points and 10 rebounds and Philadelphia routed the Minnesota Timberwolves 133-102 on Friday night.
“We're unselfish, we just want to win,” Harden said.
The wait proved worth it after Harden missed his first two games with the 76ers following the trade from Brooklyn with a hamstring injury.
The results were promising, particularly where Embiid and Harden thrive — at the free-throw line.
But the Timberwolves couldn’t replicate the dramatic win in Philadelphia earlier this season.
