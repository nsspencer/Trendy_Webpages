     New C.D.C. Guidelines Suggest 70 Percent of Americans Can Stop Wearing Masks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday offered a new strategy to help communities across the country live with the coronavirus and get back to some version of normal life.
The new guidelines suggest that 70 percent of Americans can now stop wearing masks, and no longer need to social distance or avoid crowded indoor spaces.
The recommendations no longer rely only on the number of cases in a community to determine the need for restrictions such as mask wearing.
Based on these three factors, counties can calculate whether the risk to their residents is low, medium or high, according to the agency, and only areas of high risk should require everyone to wear a mask.
But unvaccinated people should wear masks even in low-risk areas, the agency said.

     CDC debuts new mask guidelines
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The CDC eased indoor mask guidance Feb. 25, now relying on how COVID-19 is affecting a community's healthcare system — rather than transmission rates alone — as a guide for mask recommendations.
High: At this level, there is a high level of severe disease and high potential for a community's healthcare system to become strained.
The CDC recommends everyone in communities at this level wear a mask indoors and in schools, in addition to the precautions at the low and medium levels.
"We should all keep in mind that some people may choose to wear a mask based on personal preference," Dr. Walensky said.
The CDC officials also emphasized that people who remain at higher risk for COVID-19, such as people with immunocompromising conditions, may choose to take extra precautions, regardless of their community's COVID-19 level.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CDC says Americans can now go unmasked in many parts of the countryThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday it is relaxing its mask guidance for communities where hospitals aren't under high strain.
The CDC recommends continued mask use in communities where serious cases of COVID-19 are straining the health system.
"We want to give people a break from things like mask-wearing," said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky at a news briefing Friday.
Health officials emphasized that people should still wear face coverings if they wish or if they are personally at high risk.
The CDC will release updated county-by-county risk levels weekly on its website, officials said.

     CDC eases mask guidelines for more than 70% of Americans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The agency is still advising that people, including schoolchildren, wear masks where the risk of COVID is high.
Additionally, the CDC said masks are no longer necessary on buses or vans that are operated by public or private school systems.
The new recommendations do not change the requirement to wear masks on public transportation and indoors in airports, train stations and bus stations.
The CDC guidelines for other indoor spaces aren’t binding, meaning cities and institutions even in areas of low risk may set their own rules.
“Anybody is certainly welcome to wear a mask at any time if they feel safer wearing a mask,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a news briefing.

     New CDC Covid-19 metrics drop strong mask recommendations for most of the country
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Now, the CDC’s “Covid-19 community level” metrics are based on three pieces of data in a community: new Covid-19 hospitalizations, hospital capacity and new Covid-19 cases.
The CDC’s website includes a list of US counties and their current Covid-19 levels.
Under the updated guidance, more than 70% of the US population is in a location with low or medium Covid-19 community levels.
In areas with “low” Covid-19 community levels, there is no recommendation for mask wearing.
“The Covid-19 community level we are releasing today will inform CDC recommendations on prevention measures, like masking, and CDC recommendations for layered prevention measures will depend on the Covid-19 level in the community,” Walensky said.

     CDC’s new approach to covid means most Americans can go without masks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AdvertisementPeople in communities with high levels of disease, including schools, are still urged to wear masks in indoor public places — but there are far fewer of them.
Story continues below advertisementIn communities with low levels of disease, there is no recommendation for mask-wearing.
With omicron cases continuing to drop sharply, officials expect fewer communities to be facing high levels of covid-19 in the weeks ahead.
Although surveillance of virus levels in wastewater can be an early warning sign for covid-19, CDC’s current system does not yet cover every U.S. county.
The Trump White House delayed initial guidance on wearing masks in April 2020 to preserve enough of the higher-quality N95 masks for front-line health-care workers.
