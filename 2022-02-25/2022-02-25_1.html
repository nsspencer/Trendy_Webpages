     Warriors news: Klay Thompson showers Jonathan Kuminga with praise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Jon (Kuminga) is one of the best athletes I’ve ever seen at his age,” Thompson told ClutchPoints.
Seems like he has close to a 40-inch vertical and is incredibly strong and you saw that tonight.
Usually younger players have to develop physically, but this Warriors rookie has it all physically.
Everyone knew Kuminga had the potential to be special, but not even the Warriors knew he would be ready this fast.
The Warriors improved their record to 43-17, giving them a 2.5-game lead over the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference standings.

     Five observations: Warriors clobber Blazers to open stretch run. What went most right?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PORTLAND — Here are five observations from the Warriors ’ 132-95 blowout of the tanking Blazers on Thursday night, exiting the break with an easy win that placed them 2 1/2 games ahead of the Grizzlies for the West’s second seed.1.
Anfernee Simons , the best available player on what’s remaining of the Blazers, is driving left on Steph Curry from the right wing.
An alert defensive possession has already forced Simons into what would’ve been a bailout 8-foot running fadeaway with two Warriors in easy rebounding position.But Simons doesn’t get the shot up.
Curry, who was so great defensively the first few months this season, whacks the ball out of Simons’ hands.
The Warriors have been demanding that of Kuminga the past few months.

     And while it Warriors took a moment to adjust to Portland’s style, it wasn’t long before they did it better.
Here are my three big takeaways from the game:Shapeshifting StephThe Warriors didn’t need Steph Curry to repeat his spellbinding, 50-point All-Star Game performance on Thursday night.
Yes, the competition afforded the Warriors some room to experiment, and it was interesting to see what Curry did with the space.
