    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     DeRozan also passed Michael Jordan's 1988 mark for the second-longest streak of 35-plus points in Bulls history; Jordan still has the team record at 10 games, per NBC Sports Chicago.
The five-time All-Star led a late charge for Chicago, scoring back-to-back pull-up jumpers to give the Bulls a 110-108 lead.
DeRozan is currently on pace for the highest-scoring season of his 13-year career, averaging 28.3 points on 52.1 percent shooting from the field.
He ranks third in the NBA in points per game behind Joel Embiid and Giannis Antetokounmpo.
The Bulls (39-21) improved to first in the Eastern Conference with the win and will host the Memphis Grizzlies (41-20) Saturday.

     If the Chicago Bulls have a title-contending team, ownership will sign off on paying the luxury tax.
All you have to do is go back and look at the last number of championship teams, how many of them were in the luxury tax?
“And Zach knows how we feel about him.”The Bulls have paid the luxury tax once in franchise history.
You’re not going to see us make trades like that when we’re competing for championships,” Reinsdorf said.
“We’re going to spend the money because you have to invest in your team,” Reinsdorf said.

That being the case, they will consistently need more than the nine points it got from Kevin Huerter in the 112-108 loss to the Chicago Bulls.
Make no mistake, Trae Young’s night wasn’t much better as the Hawks superstar finished with 14 points and 10 assists.

     Perhaps that’s how the Bulls are looking at things at the moment when it comes to how their winning basketball games and the man that’s helping to make that happen.
After finishing up the first half with five straight wins led by historic DeMar DeRozan performances, the team started the second half in the same fashion on Thursday.
For DeRozan, his historic streak of at least 35 points and shooting at least 50 percent from the field was extended to eight.
DeRozan came though when the Bulls needed him most with his team down by three with under a minute to go.
“When you’re in those moment, you’ve got to take them on,” said DeRozan of situations like he faced on Thursday.

Indeed, whether it’s nailing the ice-cold dagger or dishing the dime for the go-ahead score, all DeRozan has done is make the right play at the right time.
He makes the right play all the time.

     Down three with 46.9 seconds left, DeRozan closed it to one with — of course — the mid-range jumper.
When the dust settled it was a 37-point game for DeRozan, and again done on a head-shaking efficiency of 15-for-21 from the field.
Jordan averaged 41.1 points per game in that run, hitting 15.3 shots per game and taking 32.1 per game for 48%.
DeRozan has averaged 38.4 points per game, but was averaging only 24.2 shots per game and hitting at 62% from the field.
The Bulls went 3-7 in Jordan’s shooting binge, while the Bulls were 6-2 since the DeRozan takeover began.
