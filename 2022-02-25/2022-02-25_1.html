     Jacked Ramsays Post Game: Blazers vs Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Portland Trail Blazers’ winning streak ends at four games as they fall 132-95 to the Golden State Warriors on what figures to be an interesting final stretch to the 2021-22 NBA season.
The “Baby Blazers” group of Anfernee Simons, Josh Hart and even Justise Winslow continue to play admirably - Simons in particular put up another star level effort that won’t even register as it becomes the norm - but the loss of Jusuf Nurkic for what will likely be the season and the shortage of top end talent to fill the gaps just proved to be too much for the Warriors who put eight players into double figures and saw Steph Curry post 18 points and an eye popping 14 assists.
Hop on with Danny Marang and Brandon Sprague as they take a look at tonight’s action, the debuts of Keon Johnson, Brandon Williams and Drew Eubanks and the upcoming schedule.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stephen Curry had 18 points and 14 assists and the Golden State Warriors returned from the All-Star break to rout the Portland Trail Blazers 132-95 on Thursday night.
Eight players finished in double figures — the last time Golden State had as many was in 2009.
Golden State pushed the lead to 20 points and went into the break ahead 70-57.
Added Thompson: "(Curry) has always been able to pass like this.
... Golden State also won the first two of the three-game series with the Blazers.

     How Stephen Curry's passing evolution could open up the Warriors' offense down the stretch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Jan. 23, Stephen Curry dished out six assists against one turnover in a two-point win over the Jazz.
It was a nod of frustration to the endless headlines maligning Curry's season-long shooting slump.
Over his last five games, Curry has 40 assists to 14 turnovers.
Curry's smoking-gun shooting display from the All-Star Game was not as present with just a 2-for-7 night from 3, but he put on a passing clinic.
There's a joy to Curry's passing in almost the same way there is with his shooting when he really starts feeling himself as an active creator.

     Five observations: Warriors clobber Blazers to open stretch run. What went most right?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PORTLAND — Here are five observations from the Warriors ’ 132-95 blowout of the tanking Blazers on Thursday night, exiting the break with an easy win that placed them 2 1/2 games ahead of the Grizzlies for the West’s second seed.1.
Anfernee Simons , the best available player on what’s remaining of the Blazers, is driving left on Steph Curry from the right wing.
An alert defensive possession has already forced Simons into what would’ve been a bailout 8-foot running fadeaway with two Warriors in easy rebounding position.But Simons doesn’t get the shot up.
Curry, who was so great defensively the first few months this season, whacks the ball out of Simons’ hands.
The Warriors have been demanding that of Kuminga the past few months.

     And while it Warriors took a moment to adjust to Portland’s style, it wasn’t long before they did it better.
Here are my three big takeaways from the game:Shapeshifting StephThe Warriors didn’t need Steph Curry to repeat his spellbinding, 50-point All-Star Game performance on Thursday night.
Yes, the competition afforded the Warriors some room to experiment, and it was interesting to see what Curry did with the space.
