     If the Chicago Bulls have a title-contending team, ownership will sign off on paying the luxury tax.
All you have to do is go back and look at the last number of championship teams, how many of them were in the luxury tax?
“And Zach knows how we feel about him.”The Bulls have paid the luxury tax once in franchise history.
You’re not going to see us make trades like that when we’re competing for championships,” Reinsdorf said.
“We’re going to spend the money because you have to invest in your team,” Reinsdorf said.

     Tristan Thompson’s Debut Was Everything the Bulls Were Missing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Seven minutes is all Tristan Thompson needed to show Chicago Bulls fans why he’s in town.
In those first 7 minutes of his Bulls debut, the big man was a six-foot-nine ball of energy, scoring 5 points and grabbing 4 rebounds.
From the energy to the execution, it added an entirely new dynamic to this Bulls team.
For a Bulls team that has hauled in the 4th-fewest rebounds per game, Thompson certainly felt like a calculated target by this front office.
The 2.3 offensive rebounds per game he brought to the Bulls immediately became the best mark on the team.

That being the case, they will consistently need more than the nine points it got from Kevin Huerter in the 112-108 loss to the Chicago Bulls.

     Perhaps that’s how the Bulls are looking at things at the moment when it comes to how their winning basketball games and the man that’s helping to make that happen.
After finishing up the first half with five straight wins led by historic DeMar DeRozan performances, the team started the second half in the same fashion on Thursday.
For DeRozan, his historic streak of at least 35 points and shooting at least 50 percent from the field was extended to eight.
DeRozan came though when the Bulls needed him most with his team down by three with under a minute to go.
“When you’re in those moment, you’ve got to take them on,” said DeRozan of situations like he faced on Thursday.

“Tristan’s voice on the bench, his voice on the court was really really impactful,” Donovan added.

It should surprise no one that this Bulls team has been receptive to that guidance.

Today, Bulls star DeMar DeRozan takes the spotlight.
The Bulls star has been in the MVP conversation for most of the season, but his case is becoming harder and harder to ignore.
He shot over 50 percent from the field in each of those games, the longest such streak in NBA history.
DeMar DeRozan has recorded 35+ points on 50% shooting from the field in 8 consecutive games, extending his record for the longest such streak in NBA History.
