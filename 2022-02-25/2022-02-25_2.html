     New C.D.C. Guidelines Suggest 70 Percent of Americans Can Stop Wearing Masks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday offered a new strategy to help communities across the country live with the coronavirus and get back to some version of normal life.
The new guidelines suggest that 70 percent of Americans can now stop wearing masks, and no longer need to social distance or avoid crowded indoor spaces.
The recommendations no longer rely only on the number of cases in a community to determine the need for restrictions such as mask wearing.
Based on these three factors, counties can calculate whether the risk to their residents is low, medium or high, according to the agency, and only areas of high risk should require everyone to wear a mask.
But unvaccinated people should wear masks even in low-risk areas, the agency said.

     CDC Eases Mask Guidelines, Reflecting Covid-19’s Retreat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Federal officials eased their guidelines on Covid-19 masking, including at schools, in a shift that reflects decreased risks from the Omicron variant, a steep drop in cases and mitigation efforts nationwide.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday changed the metrics it uses to assess Covid-19 risk by county across the U.S. Risk will now be assessed based on three factors, the CDC said: new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 residents in the past seven days; new Covid-19-related hospital admissions; and the percentage of hospital beds occupied by Covid-19 patients.

     CDC debuts new mask guidelines
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The CDC eased indoor mask guidance Feb. 25, now relying on how COVID-19 is affecting a community's healthcare system — rather than transmission rates alone — as a guide for mask recommendations.
High: At this level, there is a high level of severe disease and high potential for a community's healthcare system to become strained.
The CDC recommends everyone in communities at this level wear a mask indoors and in schools, in addition to the precautions at the low and medium levels.
"We should all keep in mind that some people may choose to wear a mask based on personal preference," Dr. Walensky said.
The CDC officials also emphasized that people who remain at higher risk for COVID-19, such as people with immunocompromising conditions, may choose to take extra precautions, regardless of their community's COVID-19 level.

About 37.3% of U.S. counties currently have high Covid levels, 39.6% have medium levels and 23% have low levels, CDC officials said.
Previously, CDC guidelines recommended masking for people over 2 who are not up to date on vaccinations or who are in areas with “substantial or high” Covid transmission.
However, many people choose cloth masks over respirator masks because cloth masks are more comfortable, a University of Virginia research team found.
TangentThe CDC’s decision to ease masking guidelines came weeks after California, New Jersey, Oregon and other states announced they would drop state mask mandates or school mask mandates.

     CDC says Americans can now go unmasked in many parts of the countryThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday it is relaxing its mask guidance for communities where hospitals aren't under high strain.
The CDC recommends continued mask use in communities where serious cases of COVID-19 are straining the health system.
"We want to give people a break from things like mask-wearing," said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky at a news briefing Friday.
Health officials emphasized that people should still wear face coverings if they wish or if they are personally at high risk.
The CDC will release updated county-by-county risk levels weekly on its website, officials said.

Story continues below advertisementIn communities with low levels of disease, there is no recommendation for mask-wearing.
With omicron cases continuing to drop sharply, officials expect fewer communities to be facing high levels of covid-19 in the weeks ahead.
Although surveillance of virus levels in wastewater can be an early warning sign for covid-19, CDC’s current system does not yet cover every U.S. county.
The Trump White House delayed initial guidance on wearing masks in April 2020 to preserve enough of the higher-quality N95 masks for front-line health-care workers.
