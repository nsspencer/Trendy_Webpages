     Bulls Buyout Big Man Shines with Double-Figure Night in Debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Aside from Tristan Thompson‘s debut, the Chicago Bulls win over the Atlanta Hawks was anything but a game of firsts.
His debut performance for the Chicago Bulls showed just why the front office brass vyed so hard for Tristan Thompson’s services on a barren buyout market.
When the Chicago Bulls brought in 30-year old Tristan Thompson, there was a question as to whether or not he’d be an upgrade over big man Tony Bradley.
In addition to his 11 points and six rebounds, Thompson finished the night with eight attempts at the free-throw line.
It’s unlikely that someone who’s played one game in a Chicago Bulls uniform will have an impact on jersey retirement plans.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Zach LaVine has been waiting for the Chicago Bulls’ roster around him to help him compete for a championship.
With LaVine shining and DeMar DeRozan playing out of his mind recently, the Bulls are at the top of the Eastern Conference.
LaVine explained to Jake Fischer of Bleacher Report that the Bulls are showing championship habits this season by being more vocal and honest about how to improve.
You just gotta be consistent everyday and have championship habits.
It’s not just, “Oh, we won or lost this game.” You have to have championship habits each and every day.

     Bulls' DeMar DeRozan extends historic scoring streak in win vs. Hawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     DeRozan also passed Michael Jordan's 1988 mark for the second-longest streak of 35-plus points in Bulls history; Jordan still has the team record at 10 games, per NBC Sports Chicago.
The five-time All-Star led a late charge for Chicago, scoring back-to-back pull-up jumpers to give the Bulls a 110-108 lead.
DeRozan is currently on pace for the highest-scoring season of his 13-year career, averaging 28.3 points on 52.1 percent shooting from the field.
He ranks third in the NBA in points per game behind Joel Embiid and Giannis Antetokounmpo.
The Bulls (39-21) improved to first in the Eastern Conference with the win and will host the Memphis Grizzlies (41-20) Saturday.

     Down three with 46.9 seconds left, DeRozan closed it to one with — of course — the mid-range jumper.
When the dust settled it was a 37-point game for DeRozan, and again done on a head-shaking efficiency of 15-for-21 from the field.
Jordan averaged 41.1 points per game in that run, hitting 15.3 shots per game and taking 32.1 per game for 48%.
DeRozan has averaged 38.4 points per game, but was averaging only 24.2 shots per game and hitting at 62% from the field.
The Bulls went 3-7 in Jordan’s shooting binge, while the Bulls were 6-2 since the DeRozan takeover began.

     A closer look into the resurgence of Chicago Bulls’ DeMar DeRozan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After spending the first nine seasons of his career with the Toronto Raptors, DeMar DeRozan was shipped to the San Antonio Spurs.
Should Chicago Bulls head coach Billy Donovan be praised as a better coach than Popovich for setting DeRozan up for greater success?
With San Antonio, DeRozan passed the ball when driving 45 percent of the time, resulting in more turnovers and less points.
His efficiency was around the same in San Antonio as it was in Toronto, but he attempted far fewer shots.
In DeRozan’s latter two seasons with San Antonio, DeRozan attempted the least amount of 15-to-19-foot jump shots per game since 2014.

     Michael Reinsdorf: Bulls “Absolutely” Willing To Pay Tax
    </h2>

     “All you have to do is go back and look at the last number of championship teams, how many of them were in the luxury tax?
It’s part of the nature of the NBA.”The stance is one that Reinsdorf and his father – team owner Jerry Reinsdorf – have conveyed in the past.
However, the franchise has a history of being relatively conservative in its spending, having paid the luxury tax just once.
“We’re going to spend the money because you have to invest in your team,” Reinsdorf said.
“I’m looking forward to it, because if we’re spending in the tax, that means we have a really good team.”

     And Tristan Thompson in his Bulls debut fit snugly in the rotation with 11 points and six rebounds in 13 minutes.
It certainly looked like it was when the Bulls began the game 10-0 and pretty much controlled the entire game.
The Bulls led 24-19 after one quarter with DeRozan tallying 16, his most for a quarter this season.
But DeRozan dribbling up court quickly saw what the Hawks were planning, his CPU processing the data quicker than anyone could react.
Dosunmu also got the rebound of the block and handed to DeRozan, who began dribbling up and surveying the Hawks defense.

The star swingman knocked down the go-ahead jumper while being fouled with 15.1 seconds left last night as the Bulls beat the Hawks, 112-108.

The Bulls -- despite injury after injury -- lead the Eastern Conference thanks to DeRozan's consistent excellence, writes our NBA expert Sam Quinn.
