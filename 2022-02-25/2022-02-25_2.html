     James Wiseman assigned to Santa Cruz Warriors, to practice Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Gabrielle Lurie / The ChroniclePORTLAND, Ore. — The Golden State Warriors have assigned second-year center James Wiseman to the team's G-Leage affiliate in Santa Cruz, the team announced on Friday.
Wiseman, 20, will practice with the team today in Santa Cruz.
He underwent successful surgery to repair a right meniscus tear on April 15.
He had been previously assigned to short stints in Santa Cruz this season on Nov. 28 and Dec. 11.
He required an additional arthroscopic procedure in December to relieve swelling, which delayed his highly anticipated return to action.

     Steph Curry explains his pregame outfit before win vs. Blazers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After dropping 50 points and splashing a record 16 3-pointers in the NBA All-Star Game on Sunday, it's understandable that Steph Curry entered the Warriors' post-break schedule with even more swagger than usual.
Hence his bold pregame outfit Thursday before the Warriors' 132-95 whooping of the Portland Trail Blazers at Moda Center.
Curry went out and scored 18 points in a win the Warriors needed to have before they enter a brutal eight-game stretch.
With their next eight games coming against playoff or play-in teams, beating a Blazers team without Damian Lillard, Jusuf Nurkic and the recently traded CJ McCollum was a must.
The Warriors will be back in action Sunday when they host the Dallas Mavericks at Chase Center.

     Here's What Steph Curry Said About His Viral Pregame Outfit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Golden State Warriors defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 132-95 in Oregon on Thursday night, which was both team's first game back since the All-Star break.
Before the game, Steph Curry wore a pregame outfit that was going viral on social media.
After the game, the two-time MVP was asked about the outfit, and his answer can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Warriors on NBCS.
The Warriors advanced to 43-17 with the win, which currently has them as the second seed in the Western Conference.
The franchise have not been to the playoffs in each of the last two seasons, but that will likely change this year.

Eight players finished in double figures — the last time Golden State had as many was in 2009.
Golden State pushed the lead to 20 points and went into the break ahead 70-57.
Added Thompson: "(Curry) has always been able to pass like this.
... Golden State also won the first two of the three-game series with the Blazers.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James Wiseman’s anticipated return to the court inched closer to reality with the team announcing that the Warriors’ 7-footer was assigned to practice with the G-League Santa Cruz Warriors on Friday.
Wiseman, 20, is expected to participate and scrimmage with the Santa Cruz team and is not expected to play Saturday’s game against the Birmingham Squadron.
Wiseman participated in a 5-on-5 scrimmage on Wednesday and the Tuesday before the All-Star break, shortly after participating in 3-on-3 contact work the week prior.
“It felt like a huge step,” Wiseman said last Wednesday, the first time he addressed media since his surgery.
He had a good All-Star break.

Golden State had 30 assists on 45 made field goals, improving to 21-1 when recording that many assists.
Golden State has desperately missed Green’s high basketball IQ.
Golden State has the seventh-toughest remaining schedule, with games against the Suns, Heat, Jazz and Bucks still to play.
But if Thursday’s win is as any indication, Golden State appears to be right on track.

     On Jan. 23, Stephen Curry dished out six assists against one turnover in a two-point win over the Jazz.
Over his last five games, Curry has 40 assists to 14 turnovers.
When his energy is high as a passer, whether he's actually hitting shots becomes even less relevant to his impact.
Curry is a different passer with Thompson on the court, like a quarterback with his top target back from a long absence.
Over his last seven games, all in February, Thompson is shooting 46 percent from 3 on over eight attempts per game.

     And while it Warriors took a moment to adjust to Portland’s style, it wasn’t long before they did it better.
Here are my three big takeaways from the game:Shapeshifting StephThe Warriors didn’t need Steph Curry to repeat his spellbinding, 50-point All-Star Game performance on Thursday night.
Curry did something we haven’t seen of him too often over the last few seasons — he was a point guard.
Yes, the competition afforded the Warriors some room to experiment, and it was interesting to see what Curry did with the space.
