     Reinsdorf: Bulls 'absolutely' will pay luxury tax for contender
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     If the Chicago Bulls have a title-contending team, ownership will sign off on paying the luxury tax.
All you have to do is go back and look at the last number of championship teams, how many of them were in the luxury tax?
“And Zach knows how we feel about him.”The Bulls have paid the luxury tax once in franchise history.
You’re not going to see us make trades like that when we’re competing for championships,” Reinsdorf said.
“We’re going to spend the money because you have to invest in your team,” Reinsdorf said.

     Ask Sam Mailbag: Bulls playoff rotation, MJ in today's NBA and more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Looking ahead to next month, Billy Donovan was recently quoted that Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso and Patrick Williams are expected to return.
Sam Smith:Donovan has previously said he prefers a nine-player rotation and perhaps eight and a half.
I suspect come playoff time, Donovan opts for the veterans, which reduces time or leaves out Williams and perhaps Dosunmu.
White is that bench boost offense so vital in playoff games and we've seen later with clutch shots late.
Without injuries, which of course change these things as we've seen this season, the primary playoff rotation seems like it likely would be Ball, LaVine, DeRozan, Green, Vucevic, Caruso, White and Thompson.

     Tristan Thompson’s Debut Was Everything the Bulls Were Missing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Seven minutes is all Tristan Thompson needed to show Chicago Bulls fans why he’s in town.
In those first 7 minutes of his Bulls debut, the big man was a six-foot-nine ball of energy, scoring 5 points and grabbing 4 rebounds.
From the energy to the execution, it added an entirely new dynamic to this Bulls team.
For a Bulls team that has hauled in the 4th-fewest rebounds per game, Thompson certainly felt like a calculated target by this front office.
The 2.3 offensive rebounds per game he brought to the Bulls immediately became the best mark on the team.

     Perhaps that’s how the Bulls are looking at things at the moment when it comes to how their winning basketball games and the man that’s helping to make that happen.
After finishing up the first half with five straight wins led by historic DeMar DeRozan performances, the team started the second half in the same fashion on Thursday.
For DeRozan, his historic streak of at least 35 points and shooting at least 50 percent from the field was extended to eight.
DeRozan came though when the Bulls needed him most with his team down by three with under a minute to go.
“When you’re in those moment, you’ve got to take them on,” said DeRozan of situations like he faced on Thursday.
