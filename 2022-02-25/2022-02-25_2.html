     76ers’ James Harden dazzles in Philadelphia debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In his 76ers debut, James Harden scored 27 points and added 12 assists and eight rebounds as Philadelphia crushed the Timberwolves 133–102 on Friday night in Minneapolis.
It was a much-anticipated debut for Harden, who was acquired at the trade deadline earlier this month from the Nets.
Skeptics of the trade were wondering how Harden would fit with Embiid, but their first game together yielded nothing but offensive excellence.
If the first game is any indication, Harden’s fit with the Embiid 76ers may be the extra boost Philadelphia needed in a postseason push.

     James Harden impresses in 76ers debut, Joel Embiid scores 34 in win vs. Timberwolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James Harden impressed in his Philadelphia 76ers debut, nearly registering a triple-double in the team's 133-102 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.
Harden finished the game with 27 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds.
Starring alongside the new Sixer was big man Joel Embiid, who logged his own double-double with 34 points and 10 rebounds.
Harden missed his last three games with Brooklyn with hamstring tightness, while Philadelphia opted to rest him through the All-Star break following the trade.
When speaking about his trade to the Sixers in his introductory news conference, Harden said Philadelphia was a "perfect fit."

     Through 3 QuartersThis game looks like it will end up very different from the tight one-point margin of the Minnesota Timberwolves' win over the Philadelphia 76ers in their previous head-to-head November of last year.
After three quarters it's looking more and more like Philadelphia's high-powered offense is just too much for the Timberwolves as Philadelphia lead 94-74.

     Where were you when James Harden made his NBA debut?
Georges Niang needs to shoot the lights out for the Philadelphia 76ers.
Why, you may ask, is this relevant to the Philadelphia 76ers?
Well, because Georges Niang is a shooter, but much like diner lobster, he isn’t a shooter shooter.
With James Harden and Joel Embiid, the Sixers now have two of the top-10 most double-teamed players in the NBA.

     Harden had 27 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds in his 76ers debut, Joel Embiid added 34 points and 10 rebounds and Philadelphia routed the Minnesota Timberwolves 133-102 on Friday night.
“We're unselfish, we just want to win,” Harden said.
The wait proved worth it after Harden missed his first two games with the 76ers following the trade from Brooklyn with a hamstring injury.
The results were promising, particularly where Embiid and Harden thrive — at the free-throw line.
But the Timberwolves couldn’t replicate the dramatic win in Philadelphia earlier this season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stephen A. Smith sees James Harden as having more questions to answer about his future than Ben Simmons.
pic.twitter.com/wHeMsTZvrK — Philadelphia 76ers (@sixers) February 25, 2022Harden, meanwhile, has proved -- including during his two-season, 80-game run with the Nets -- that he is not exactly energetic when he doesn't have the ball in his hands.
"They don't -- just like they didn't have enough last year," an Eastern Conference scout said, when asked if the 76ers have enough shooting.
Coach Doc Rivers has said Philadelphia needs another guard, and the 76ers have struggled when Maxey isn't on the court.
Then, it will be up to Harden, Embiid and the 76ers to find a way to make it work in time for the postseason.
