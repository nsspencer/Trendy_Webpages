     Reports: CDC Expected to Relax COVID-19 Mask Guidance Shortly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as soon as Friday will loosen its guidelines for indoor mask use, according to multiple reports.
The new recommendations will still consider coronavirus caseloads but will also take into account hospitalizations and local hospital capacity, according to the Associated Press, which first reported the change.
It’s unclear what impact the new recommendations will have on state and local COVID-19 measures, considering nearly every state has dropped or has plans to drop indoor mask mandates.
CDC Director Rochelle Walensky last week said that a guidance update would come soon.
Still, the U.S. is averaging more than 75,000 new infections and 1,600 deaths from the coronavirus each day, according to CDC data.

     CDC relaxes indoor mask guidelines as COVID cases in US drop
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The CDC relaxed its mask guidelines Friday after the agency acknowledged the risk of severe COVID-19 cases has gone down as the Biden administration moves to shift its focus on how it’ll manage the virus moving forward.
But now the CDC will also factor in hospitalization rates and infirmary capacities before issuing mask recommendations.
Under the new guidelines, most US counties no longer meet the threshold at which indoor masking in public is recommended.
Instead of looking only at confirmed COVID-19 case counts, the agency will take a more holistic view of the risk the virus poses to communities.

     New CDC Covid-19 metrics drop strong mask recommendations for most of the country
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     New CDC metrics indicate that about 28% of people in the United States live in a county where they need to wear masks indoors.
Previously, CDC pointed to levels of coronavirus transmission within communities as a key metric for restrictions and recommended that people in areas with high or substantial levels of transmission -- about 99% of the population -- should wear masks indoors.
Under the updated guidance, more than 70% of the US population is in a location with low or medium Covid-19 community levels.
For those areas, there is no recommendation for indoor masking unless you are at potential "increased risk" for Covid-19 and if so, the CDC recommends to talk to your health care provider about wearing a mask.
"We're in a better place today than we were six months ago, six weeks ago, six days ago," US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement to CNN.

     CDC says Americans can now go unmasked in many parts of the country
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The CDC recommends continued mask use in communities where serious cases of COVID-19 are straining the health system.
The move to ease masking guidance, federal officials say, reflects current conditions at this phase of the pandemic, including widespread immunity through vaccination and prior infection as well as better access to testing and treatments.
Health officials emphasized that people should still wear masks if they wish or if they are personally at high risk.
At that point, CDC said masking indoors was advised in parts of the country with "substantial or high" spread of the virus, which it defined as 50-100 or more new weekly cases per 100,000 people.
Under the CDC's new risk metrics, an area is deemed "high" risk if it has concerning levels of COVID hospital admissions and hospital capacity taken up by COVID patients.

     CDC Significantly Loosens Mask Guidelines

About 37.3% of U.S. counties currently have high Covid levels, 39.6% have medium levels and 23% have low levels, CDC officials said.
Previously, CDC guidelines recommended masking for people over 2 who are not up to date on vaccinations or who are in areas with “substantial or high” Covid transmission.
However, many people choose cloth masks over respirator masks because cloth masks are more comfortable, a University of Virginia research team found.
TangentThe CDC’s decision to ease masking guidelines came weeks after California, New Jersey, Oregon and other states announced they would drop state mask mandates or school mask mandates.
