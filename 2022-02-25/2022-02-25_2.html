     James Wiseman assigned to Santa Cruz Warriors, to practice Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Gabrielle Lurie / The ChroniclePORTLAND, Ore. — The Golden State Warriors have assigned second-year center James Wiseman to the team's G-Leage affiliate in Santa Cruz, the team announced on Friday.
Wiseman, 20, will practice with the team today in Santa Cruz.
He underwent successful surgery to repair a right meniscus tear on April 15.
He had been previously assigned to short stints in Santa Cruz this season on Nov. 28 and Dec. 11.
He required an additional arthroscopic procedure in December to relieve swelling, which delayed his highly anticipated return to action.

     Here's What Steve Kerr Said After The Warriors Beat The Trail Blazers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Golden State Warriors crushed the Portland Trail Blazers 132-95 on Thursday evening in their first game back from the All-Star break.
The win improved them to 43-17 in 60 games played on the season, and they are currently the second seed in the Western Conference.
After the game, head coach Steve Kerr spoke to reporters, and a clip of what he said can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Warriors on NBCS.
The Warriors have missed the playoffs in each of the last two seasons (Klay Thompson also missed the last two seasons to injury), but that appears likely to change this year.
They look like one of the legitimate contenders to win the NBA Championship this summer.

     The Warriors' second-year center was assigned to the team's G League affiliate on Friday, where he will participate in a practice with the Santa Cruz Warriors.
There was some speculation that Wiseman will play in the Sea Dubs' G League contest Saturday against the Birmingham Squadron, but The Athletic's Anthony Slater reported that Wiseman won't play in Saturday's game.
This is for a scrimmage/practice today, not tomorrowâs Santa Cruz game https://t.co/IpkGOUz3pv — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) February 25, 2022The No.
It is expected that Wiseman will play a few games for Santa Cruz before he makes his season debut for the big club.
After Saturday, the Sea Dubs play Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday of next week.

     Warrior Steph Curry Calls Former No. 2 Pick a ‘Beast’ as Return Nears
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As if the long buildup to James Wiseman’s return hadn’t garnered enough anticipation already, Golden State Warriors teammate Steph Curry helped matters with a rather glowing assessment of the 20-year-old center.
Wiseman had originally been slated to return much earlier in the season, but suffered a setback that led to another surgery in December.
Now cleared for contact work and participating in scrimmages, Wiseman’s return could be just days away, and Curry gave Warriors fans a preview of what to expect when he’s back.
“He’s a beast when you look at him on the floor, especially with the rest of our team,” Curry said, via Dalton Johnson of NBC Sports Bay Area.

     Five observations: Warriors clobber Blazers to open stretch run. What went most right?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PORTLAND — Here are five observations from the Warriors ’ 132-95 blowout of the tanking Blazers on Thursday night, exiting the break with an easy win that placed them 2 1/2 games ahead of the Grizzlies for the West’s second seed.1.
Anfernee Simons , the best available player on what’s remaining of the Blazers, is driving left on Steph Curry from the right wing.
An alert defensive possession has already forced Simons into what would’ve been a bailout 8-foot running fadeaway with two Warriors in easy rebounding position.But Simons doesn’t get the shot up.
Curry, who was so great defensively the first few months this season, whacks the ball out of Simons’ hands.
The Warriors have been demanding that of Kuminga the past few months.

     And while it Warriors took a moment to adjust to Portland’s style, it wasn’t long before they did it better.
Here are my three big takeaways from the game:Shapeshifting StephThe Warriors didn’t need Steph Curry to repeat his spellbinding, 50-point All-Star Game performance on Thursday night.
Curry did something we haven’t seen of him too often over the last few seasons — he was a point guard.
Yes, the competition afforded the Warriors some room to experiment, and it was interesting to see what Curry did with the space.
