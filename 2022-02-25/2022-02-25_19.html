In response to this, she was asked that while she has been open about her admiration for Kangana Ranaut, does she feel bad that it doesn't get reciprocated.
In Gangubai Kathiawadi, Alia Bhatt plays a character inspired by a real-life sex worker, who eventually became a prominent and celebrated figure in the Kamathipua red-light district of Mumbai.

     'Gangubai Kathiawadi': Alia Bhatt-starrer off to a good start at the box office
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Actor Alia Bhat's latest movie Gangubai Kathiawadi, which hit the screens on February 25, has received a good response at the domestic box office.
The film's day 1 collection will be between Rs 7 crore and Rs 10 crore, according to initial estimates.
The romantic-comedy netted merely Rs 1.65 crore earlier this month, putting up decent numbers only in select multiplexes.
Gangubai Kathiawadi will either match or outperform Alia's last 'heroine-centric' film Raazi, which premiered in theatres in 2018.
Gangubai Kathiawadi has been directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and marks his first collaboration with Alia.

More Vijay Raaz &amp; a tighter edit would have helped but… The misinformed narrative of #AliaBhatt not being capable enough to pull this off is laughable because she has hit it out of the park.”Alia Bhatt’s Gangubai Kathiawadi reviewsFor the unversed, Gangubai Kathiawadi is based on the life of Gangubai Kothewali.
Meanwhile, before its release, Gangubai Kathiawadi was premiered on February 16, 2022, at 72nd Berlin International Film Festival.

     Gangubai Kathiawadi belongs to Bhatt &amp; Bhansali
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Thus goes one of the many filmy dialogues from the film Gangubai Kathiawadi.
The question here isn’t whether the life story of Gangubai, a prostitute-turned-leader, is befitting a celluloid tale.
Alia becomes this Gangubai, who after having seen the seamier side of life, learns to call the shots.
While the spotlight is on Gangubai alone, Bhansali does manage to make us feel for them and their unenviable plight.
Well, it sure does... even the character of Jim Sarbh as journalist has inflections that accentuate our awe of this woman called Gangubai.
