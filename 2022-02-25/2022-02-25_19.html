     The IRS has issued over 22 million tax refunds. Here’s the average payment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The tax season kicked off on Jan. 24, and the IRS has issued more than 22 million tax refunds worth around $78 billion, the agency reported Friday.
As of Feb. 18, the average refund was $3,536, over $700 higher than last year's payment of $2,815, as reported through Dec. 3.
Some tax experts predict smaller refunds for families who received the advance child tax credit, borrowers who paused student loan payments or investors with sizable mutual fund payouts.
While the agency issues most refunds within 21 days, several factors may cause delays, including paper-filed returns, payments by mail, errors or returns affected by identity theft.
The IRS sent about 7.4 million "math error" notices for stimulus payment mistakes from Jan. 1 through July 15, 2021, delaying refunds, and many are still waiting for a resolution.

     Tax refunds hit average $3,536 for millions of early filers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tax refund cash keeps flowing into wallets and bank accounts with the Internal Revenue Service reporting that it has already issued more than $78 billion in federal income tax refunds.
The IRS received 35.9 million individual income tax returns through Feb. 18 and so far has processed 33.46 million income tax returns.
Getting tax refund cash early in the year is essential for millions of families who may be living paycheck to paycheck or face major bills in the winter.
The IRS data involving refunds received via direct deposit through Feb. 18 includes refunds for income tax returns received in the prior year or the current year but processed in 2022.
The average tax refund was $2,323 as of Feb. 11 — about three weeks after the Jan. 24 kickoff when the IRS began accepting and processing 2021 tax returns.

     Here's the Average Tax Refund So Far in 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     At this point, we're still pretty early on in the 2022 tax season (during which 2021 returns are being filed), but so far, the IRS has processed about 13 million tax returns.
This year's average tax refund may also end up being lower than last year's because many families with kids already received half of the Child Tax Credit in 2021.
It may be that you're getting a tax refund in line with the average so far.
Meanwhile, it'll be interesting to see what the average tax refund amounts to once the 2022 filing season is wrapped up.
But so far, it seems like the average refund recipient is in for a decent pile of cash.

     And with millions of returns from 2021 still waiting to be processed, 2022 may be worse.
Over 15 million returns and 5 million pieces of taxpayer correspondence from 2021 sit untouched – including 6 million original 1040s.
Amended 2021 returns are taking more than 20 weeks to process.
But don’t expect much more luck getting help over the phone.
It is also a good idea to keep copies of everything and not freak out if you get an IRS notice.

     Americans are worried about smaller tax refunds. They may have reason for concern.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Based on early data from the tax agency, it turns out there may be some justification for the dread.
The remaining half — either $1,500 for older children or $1,800 for younger kids — can be claimed on this year's tax returns.
That's less than the $2,000 families claimed on their returns in prior years for the CTC, which could lead to a smaller refund, tax experts say.
"We loved getting those advanced CTC payments last year, but that may mean a smaller refund as a result."
Deductions lower an individual's taxable income, which means not having the tax deduction could result in a smaller tax refund.
