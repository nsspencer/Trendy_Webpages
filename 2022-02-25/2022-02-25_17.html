     Art Briles Refuses To Go Away
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Six years after he was fired by Baylor University for his role in the creation of a football program that became synonymous with sexual assault, Art Briles is finally returning to a college sideline.
Grambling State announced on Thursday that Briles, who was head coach of the Baylor Bears from 2008 to 2016, has been hired as the team’s offensive coordinator.
An investigation into Baylor’s institutional failure to prevent these assaults, the full findings of which were never made public, resulted in Briles being fired.
That Briles is returning to the ranks of college coaching now, all these years later, speaks to his steadfast refusal to accept that the sport is better off without him.
The lengthy, labyrinthine path that Briles has followed back to college football is evidence of how little interest he has ever had in accepting the consequences of his own actions.

The hiring of Art Briles as offensive coordinator is considered a questionable move by Grambling State officials.
What would the legend Eddie Robinson say about hiring Art Briles?
On Thursday, Williams told the Washington Post he's "not a fan at all" of Briles becoming the offensive coordinator at Grambling.
On Thursday, a Grambling representative confirmed Art Briles' hire with me and then confirmed that there would be "no press release," only at "KTAL exclusive interview."

     If Hue Jackson cared about HBCUs, he wouldn’t have hired Art Briles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     And now Hue Jackson — a man with an 11-44 record as an NFL head coach — has hired Art Briles, a serial rape enabler, to his staff at Grambling State University — arguably the most historic program in all of HBCU football.
“I’ve gotten to know coach Briles, and he’s a tremendous offensive-minded football coach,’’ Jackson said about Briles in 2016.
In 2019, a sorority graduate adviser who was also the executive assistant to the president at Fort Valley State University was indicted in a prostitution ring.
Nothing positive can come from this as HBCUs are trying to clean up their campuses when someone with Briles’ reputation and past gets hired.
AdvertisementWhen Hue Jackson was hired at Grambling he said he planned to stay “until they kick me out.” I hope he meant that.

     Grambling State's hire of fired Baylor coach Art Briles is a fresh stain for college sports | Opinion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Art Briles should not be employed as a college football coach.
College football coaches are tasked with leading young men.
An investigation found Briles presided over a football program in which accusations of sexual assault and violence involving his players went unchecked.
The only explanation for Briles being a college football coach today is a belief that winning trumps all.
He was fired for his failures as the leader of a football program that victimized women, and his re-entry into college football is another stain on a sport that knows no shame.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     "I think it's tempting to dismiss what happened at Baylor now that so much time has passed," Zalkin told ESPN after Briles' hire was announced.
It made him a titan, revered and honored, with awards named for him and a museum on the Grambling campus in his honor.
"I knew the talks were out there that they were going to see if Coach Briles had interest, but I never really thought we would actually do that.
I don't have anything against Coach Briles.
In bringing Art Briles to campus, it is sending a message: If winning comes with a moral or ethical cost, so be it.

     Why Grambling's hire of Art Briles is an insult of irreducible proportions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This thanks to Hue Jackson, the former NFL head coach and offensive coach who became Grambling’s 14th head coach last December.
The Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League tried to hire Briles in 2017, but withdrew the offer after considerable backlash.
In 2019, former Southern Miss head coach Jay Hopson tried to hire Briles as his offensive coordinator, but university president Rodney Bennett overruled the hire.
Briles’ offensive genius is the obvious reason why — Jackson clearly wants the best guy on his staff, and perhaps from a schematic perspective, Briles is that guy.
Doug Williams, who was Grambling’s head coach from 1998 through 2003, and from 2011 through 2013, may have put it best.
