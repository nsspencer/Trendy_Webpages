     Kendall Jenner Debuts a Dramatic New Hair Color on the Prada Runway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As if you needed more proof that copper is the hair color of the moment, today Kendall Jenner unveiled a new shocking red dye job on the Prada runway in Milan.
The 26-year-old model’s freshly dyed red lengths were worn in a sleek, sculptural chignon crafted by Guido Palau above a black plume-embellished coat and sheer gray slip skirt look.
Photo: Courtesy of Guido Palau / @guidopalauIt’s not the first time Jenner has traded in her natural glossy brunette for a transformative new shade—or catapulted it into the spotlight on the catwalk.
Being the trend-setter that she is, Jenner’s new auburn will naturally add proverbial fuel to the fire that is the current obsession with red hair.
Gird your loins for the double-process dye job accordingly.
