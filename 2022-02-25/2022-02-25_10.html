     After Ukraine, Russia threatens Finland on NATO membership
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russia has warned neighboring Finland on Friday of "serious military and political" repercussions if the Scandinavian nation opts to join NATO following the invasion of Ukraine.
Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said during a weekly briefing that a Finnish addition to NATO could have "detrimental consequences."
Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin said on Thursday that the debate within Finland on NATO membership "will change" following the start of a war in Ukraine.

     Finland, Sweden to receive enhanced access to NATO intel over Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine extends Moscow’s military power to the borders of several NATO members, NATO partners Finland and Sweden can be part of an intensified exchange of information and NATO’s strategic communication.
NATO partners Finland, Sweden and the EU were also invited to participate.
Finland and Sweden are two of six countries known as ‘enhanced partners’, largely due to their contributions to NATO operations.
Earlier on Friday (26 February), as NATO leaders were meeting in Brussels, Russia accused NATO and the US of trying to lure Finland and Sweden into the alliance.
Together with Austria, Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta, Finland and Sweden are the only EU states that are not members of NATO.

     Russia-Ukraine crisis: Sweden, Finland firm on staying out of NATO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sweden and Finland plan to stay out of NATO despite the "shock" of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, leaders of the two countries said Thursday.
"In a situation like this it is important that Sweden's long-standing security policy stays firm.
We will use the means at our disposal, including cooperation with NATO partners," Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told a press conference.
Unlike Sweden, Finland has adopted a so-called "NATO option" provision, which means that "if Finland's security requires it, Finland has the opportunity to apply for membership", Prime Minister Sanna Marin said.
"The attack is a serious violation of international law and puts innocent people's lives at risk," Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store tweeted.

     Russia's threats to Finland "nothing new," Niinistö says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Finnish President Sauli Niinistö on Friday said Nato had offered to share up-to-date confidential information on the Ukraine crisis with Finland and Sweden.
Niinistö, however, said the invitation to share information wasn't that remarkable, as Finland as a partner country already communicated with the alliance.
Niinistö said Russian President Vladimir Putin used similar rhetoric when visiting him in Finland in 2016, while Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov made identical comments in January of this year.
Earlier on Friday Niinistö told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over the phone that Finland would be increasing its financial support to the country.
During the call with Zelensky, Niinistö reiterated that Finland strongly condemns Russia's military actions in Ukraine and supports Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.

     Marin has said Finland is “very unlikely” to seek full membership in the alliance, but she emphasized this week that Russia has no say in the matter.
WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS NOT SENDING US TROOPS TO UKRAINE“No acute discussions are currently underway about the possibility of Finland applying to NATO,” Marin told reporters.
Western officials interpreted her warning as another sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression might not stop with Ukraine.
“No illusions possible about Putin's will to dominate Europe well beyond the former borders of the Soviet Union,” Germany’s Reinhard Butikofer, a senior member of the European Parliament, wrote on Twitter.
“The Finnish Defense Forces has good readiness to fulfill the responsibilities belonging to it,” Defense Minister Antti Kaikkonen said.

“I don’t think the people of Sweden and Finland will be intimidated by Putin to forsake NATO membership,” said Jorge Benitez of the Atlantic Council.
“I think Putin’s aggressive behavior and bullying threats will soon push Sweden and Finland to join the Alliance.
“I don’t think there’s an appetite, at this point, for Finland and Sweden to change their position on NATO membership,” she said.
