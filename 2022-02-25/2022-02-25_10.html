    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Amanda Bynes is aiming to end her conservatorship after nearly nine years.
Bynes’s mother, Lynn Organ, was granted temporary conservatorship in 2013 after the actor allegedly set a driveway on fire and was hospitalized on an involuntary psychiatric hold.
Variety confirms that Bynes filed a petition on Feb. 23 to end her conservatorship.
Bynes’ assets are part of a separate trust overseen by her father, and are not subject to the conservatorship.
Bynes contends her condition has improved, and protection of the court is no longer necessary,” her attorney, David A. Esquibias, wrote.
