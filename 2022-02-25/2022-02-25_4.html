     CDC ‘significantly’ changing COVID mask guidelines, reports say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control is set to “significantly” ease mask-wearing guidelines put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19, according to published reports.
The change means most Americans will no longer be advised to wear masks in indoor public settings.
Citing sources familiar with the matter, the AP reported the CDC will move away from looking only at COVID case numbers towards a holistic approach that includes caseloads, hospitalizations and hospital capacity.
Under current guidelines, some 95% of U.S. counties are considered areas of substantial or high transmission, meaning masks are recommended.
COVID case numbers in America are plummeting after a spike due to the omicron variant, a highly transmissible strain that caused less severe illness and fewer hospitalizations.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Biden administration is expected to drop mask guidelines for most people in indoor public settings on Friday, according to Associated Press.
Currently, masks are recommended in communities with high substantial or high transmission, which is about 95% of counties in the United States.
Under these new guidelines, however, most Americans don’t currently live in areas were indoor masking in public is encouraged.
Further, the commonwealth is among the top five states and United States territories with declining COVID hospitalizations, averaging 50% fewer than two weeks ago.
She also tweeted Thursday night that the CDC has been analyzing COVID data and will shift focus on how to prevent severe outcomes and minimize healthcare strains.

     CDC To Loosen Mask Guidance To Adjust To ‘New Phase’ Of PandemicThe Biden administration is expected Friday to ease federal mask-wearing guidelines, moving away from current advice that most Americans should wear masks in indoor public settings.
The change comes weeks after numerous states, including those led by Democratic governors, announced plans to lift mandates as omicron cases drop sharply.
But states have long been pressing the agency for better guidelines to inform their decisions to ease restrictions, the officials said.
That shift will mean roughly 20 percent of the country can now pull back on mask mandates and social-distancing limits, one senior administration official said.

     Under the new guidelines, most Americans will likely no longer live in areas where indoor masking in public is advised.
The federal change comes as nearly all U.S. states are letting local mask mandates lapse as COVID-19 cases drop nationwide.
CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky has said a change on mask guidance has been in the works for some time.
The White House has been eager for the CDC to provide an update on its indoor mask recommendation, although it doesn't want to appear to be pressuring the agency, NBC News has reported.
Walensky has also said mask policies should be made at the local level, based on factors such as vaccination rates and hospitalization.

     Covid Live Updates: Over 5 Million Children Lost Caregivers to the Virus, Study Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     An earlier study, focused on the first 13 months of the pandemic, arrived at an estimate of 1.5 million affected children.
Using updated figures on Covid-related deaths, the researchers now calculate that at least 2.7 million children lost a parent or caregiver during the first 13 months.
The new study covers data through October 2021, and does not include the latest surge in cases from the Omicron variant, which have undoubtedly added to the toll.
Children of color in the United States, she added, are particularly at risk of negative consequences.
The study in The Lancet found that two out of three children orphaned are between 10 and 17, and a majority of the children who lost a parent lost their father.

     The CDC will revise mask guidelines today. Most people will not need to wear them.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will issue new COVID-19 mask guidelines today that will advise that most Americans no longer need to wear masks indoors, multiple sources involved in drafting the guidelines said.
Under the new guidelines, the vast majority of Americans will no longer live in areas where indoor masking in public is recommended, based on current data.
The new guidelines will be based less on new cases and more on tangible “meaningful consequences” of infection, including hospitalizations, emergency room visits and deaths.
It remains to be seen how the new guidelines will affect specific settings, such as health care and mass transit.
These kinds of lawsuits are unfolding across the country as policyholders try to force insurance companies to help pay for COVID-19 losses.
