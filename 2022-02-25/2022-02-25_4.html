     CDC ‘significantly’ changing COVID mask guidelines, reports say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control is set to “significantly” ease mask-wearing guidelines put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19, according to published reports.
The change means most Americans will no longer be advised to wear masks in indoor public settings.
Citing sources familiar with the matter, the AP reported the CDC will move away from looking only at COVID case numbers towards a holistic approach that includes caseloads, hospitalizations and hospital capacity.
Under current guidelines, some 95% of U.S. counties are considered areas of substantial or high transmission, meaning masks are recommended.
COVID case numbers in America are plummeting after a spike due to the omicron variant, a highly transmissible strain that caused less severe illness and fewer hospitalizations.

     Reports: CDC Expected to Relax COVID-19 Mask Guidance Shortly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as soon as Friday will loosen its guidelines for indoor mask use, according to multiple reports.
The new recommendations will still consider coronavirus caseloads but will also take into account hospitalizations and local hospital capacity, according to the Associated Press, which first reported the change.
It’s unclear what impact the new recommendations will have on state and local COVID-19 measures, considering nearly every state has dropped or has plans to drop indoor mask mandates.
CDC Director Rochelle Walensky last week said that a guidance update would come soon.
Still, the U.S. is averaging more than 75,000 new infections and 1,600 deaths from the coronavirus each day, according to CDC data.

     CDC expected to loosen mask guidelines Friday, changing approach to how it monitors COVID
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Biden administration is expected to drop mask guidelines for most people in indoor public settings on Friday, according to Associated Press.
Currently, masks are recommended in communities with high substantial or high transmission, which is about 95% of counties in the United States.
Under these new guidelines, however, most Americans don’t currently live in areas were indoor masking in public is encouraged.
Further, the commonwealth is among the top five states and United States territories with declining COVID hospitalizations, averaging 50% fewer than two weeks ago.
She also tweeted Thursday night that the CDC has been analyzing COVID data and will shift focus on how to prevent severe outcomes and minimize healthcare strains.

     Under the new guidelines, most Americans will likely no longer live in areas where indoor masking in public is advised.
The federal change comes as nearly all U.S. states are letting local mask mandates lapse as COVID-19 cases drop nationwide.
CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky has said a change on mask guidance has been in the works for some time.
The White House has been eager for the CDC to provide an update on its indoor mask recommendation, although it doesn't want to appear to be pressuring the agency, NBC News has reported.
Walensky has also said mask policies should be made at the local level, based on factors such as vaccination rates and hospitalization.

     CDC to significantly ease pandemic mask guidelines Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Biden administration will significantly loosen federal mask-wearing guidelines to protect against COVID-19 transmission on Friday, according to two people familiar with the matter, meaning most Americans will no longer be advised to wear masks in indoor public settings.
Under current guidelines, masks are recommended for people residing in communities of substantial or high transmission — roughly 95% of U.S. counties, according to the latest data.
The change comes as nearly all U.S. states that had put in place indoor mask-wearing mandates for the winter omicron surge are letting them lapse as cases have precipitously dropped nationwide.
It was not immediately clear how the new CDC guidance would affect U.S. federal mandates requiring face coverings on public transportation.
However, she declined to give a specific day when the CDC would announce a change.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will issue new COVID-19 mask guidelines today that will advise that most Americans no longer need to wear masks indoors, multiple sources involved in drafting the guidelines said.
Under the new guidelines, the vast majority of Americans will no longer live in areas where indoor masking in public is recommended, based on current data.
The new guidelines will be based less on new cases and more on tangible “meaningful consequences” of infection, including hospitalizations, emergency room visits and deaths.
It remains to be seen how the new guidelines will affect specific settings, such as health care and mass transit.
These kinds of lawsuits are unfolding across the country as policyholders try to force insurance companies to help pay for COVID-19 losses.
