     Kendall Jenner Walked The Prada AW22 Show With Red Hair
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This season, it seems Kendall Jenner has succumbed to the winds of change and decided to try out one of the most popular shades of the season, debuting a new copper-toned hair colour at the Prada autumn/winter 2022 show.
The 26-year-old model took to the catwalk in Milan sporting a sleek and lacquered sky-scraping chignon, a look masterminded by the runway's favoured hair stylist, Guido Palau.
Victor VIRGILE Getty ImagesPietro S. D'Aprano Getty ImagesFor those interested in trying a copper shade for yourself, it's imperative to speak to your hair stylist who can advise you on what you can realistically achieve with your current hair shade.
For a lighter red hue such as Jenner's, darker hair tones would have to first be lightened with bleach in order to get the most natural-looking finish.
Always remember to show up to your appointment prepared with image references; giving your hair stylist visuals will allow you to both understand what you want to achieve and save you from disappointment with the outcome.
