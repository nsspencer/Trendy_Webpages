     CDC to Ease Covid-19 Mask Rules, Reports Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could ease mask guidelines as soon as Friday, according to reports from a number of media outlets.
Current CDC guidelines, which currently recommend indoor masking nearly everywhere in the U.S., have been roundly ignored in recent weeks.
State after state has lifted indoor mask mandates.
Hawaii is currently the only state remaining with an indoor mask mandate and no announced plans to lift it.

     CDC ‘significantly’ changing COVID mask guidelines, reports say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control is set to “significantly” ease mask-wearing guidelines put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19, according to published reports.
The change means most Americans will no longer be advised to wear masks in indoor public settings.
Citing sources familiar with the matter, the AP reported the CDC will move away from looking only at COVID case numbers towards a holistic approach that includes caseloads, hospitalizations and hospital capacity.
Under current guidelines, some 95% of U.S. counties are considered areas of substantial or high transmission, meaning masks are recommended.
COVID case numbers in America are plummeting after a spike due to the omicron variant, a highly transmissible strain that caused less severe illness and fewer hospitalizations.

     Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaks during a Senate hearing of November 4, 2021.
She is expected to announce a change in mask guidance on Friday.
Currently, the CDC recommends wearing masks in public indoor spaces like movie theaters and churches in areas with substantial or high transmission of the coronavirus, defined by case counts.
Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, director of the CDC, is expected to make the announcement Friday afternoon.
In neighboring New York City, Mayor Eric Adams said he plans on easing requirements there as soon as the CDC makes its changes official.

     Reports: CDC Expected to Relax COVID-19 Mask Guidance Shortly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as soon as Friday will loosen its guidelines for indoor mask use, according to multiple reports.
The new recommendations will still consider coronavirus caseloads but will also take into account hospitalizations and local hospital capacity, according to the Associated Press, which first reported the change.
It’s unclear what impact the new recommendations will have on state and local COVID-19 measures, considering nearly every state has dropped or has plans to drop indoor mask mandates.
CDC Director Rochelle Walensky last week said that a guidance update would come soon.
Still, the U.S. is averaging more than 75,000 new infections and 1,600 deaths from the coronavirus each day, according to CDC data.

     The CDC will revise mask guidelines today. Most people will not need to wear them.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will issue new COVID-19 mask guidelines today that will advise that most Americans no longer need to wear masks indoors, multiple sources involved in drafting the guidelines said.
Under the new guidelines, the vast majority of Americans will no longer live in areas where indoor masking in public is recommended, based on current data.
The new guidelines will be based less on new cases and more on tangible “meaningful consequences” of infection, including hospitalizations, emergency room visits and deaths.
It remains to be seen how the new guidelines will affect specific settings, such as health care and mass transit.
These kinds of lawsuits are unfolding across the country as policyholders try to force insurance companies to help pay for COVID-19 losses.
