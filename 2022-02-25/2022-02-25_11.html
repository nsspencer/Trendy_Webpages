     Vergecast: reviews for the Steam Deck and Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Every Friday, The Verge publishes our flagship podcast, The Vergecast, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.
This week is a pretty gadget-heavy episode about some heavy gadgets.
Senior reports editor Sean Hollister starts the show with his review of the Steam Deck, the latest portable gaming system.
Sean explains how it was the hardest review he's done and why he decided to give it a 6.5 score, despite the amount of fun he had using it.
You can listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full discussion.

     Where’s your Steam Deck preorder email? Valve explains

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Valve’s $400-and-up portable gaming PC the Steam Deck went on sale this morning... but you didn’t get an email from Valve, I’m guessing?
And if your reservation says “After Q2 2022,” Valve says stay tuned for “news soon.” Perhaps that means they’ll stop shipping weekly at that point?
Like I explain in my Steam Deck review, it’s basically an early access game console.
Got any more questions about the Steam Deck that aren’t addressed in the reviews?
Hit me up at sean@theverge.com and I’ll try to answer in an FAQ next week.

     Portable PC gaming's moment arrives with Valve's Steam Deck
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Axios on facebook Axios on twitter Axios on linkedin Axios on emailOne of PC gaming’s top companies is making one of its biggest bets with today’s launch of the Steam Deck.
Why it matters: Valve hopes Steam Deck can make portable high-end PC gaming a lasting thing.
The details: The Steam Deck ($300-$650) is a powerful portable, a bit larger than a Nintendo Switch but similar in design: a screen flanked by the inputs of a game controller.
Its face includes a “Steam” button, signaling its capacity to smoothly launch Valve’s Steam store and any customer’s library of games.
What’s next: Steam Deck, as with most hardware launched in this pandemic, will be supply-constrained for a while.

     Valve Steam Deck Review: Glitchy but Promising
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Since then, I've amassed a vast library of games on Steam, the platform created by Valve; it's how most people play games on their computers.
I was intrigued when Valve announced the Steam Deck last year, a handheld portable gaming console that lets you play your PC games anywhere.
It means the software needs more work, but it also shows how committed Valve is to the Steam Deck.
Bulky MachinePhotograph: ValveI received the top-end Steam Deck that retails for $649, which includes a 512-gigabyte solid-state drive.
This Steam Deck is bulky, but not as heavy as I had imagined nor as uncomfortable to hold.

     Review: The real star feature of Valve’s Steam Deck is its price tag
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (Steam Deck UI screenshot)Several other games simply refused to run on my Deck, or were unplayable once they did.
Fight clubThe Steam Deck, out of the box, has Bluetooth compatibility and a single USB-C port.
(Steam Deck UI image)To some extent, this is a review in progress.
For another, I’d argue that the real marquee feature of the Steam Deck isn’t its portability, but its price point.
You may not need a Steam Deck, but you probably know a college student or newbie gamer who could use one.

     The Steam Deck is my new favorite console
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Steam Deck has the greatest launch lineup everOut of the box, the Steam Deck connects to Steam and its thousands of games, including any you may have purchased over the past decade and a half in your Steam library.
But the Steam Deck isn’t quite a portable game console — it’s a portable gaming PC.
For better and worse, the Steam Deck is a PCYes, for a moment, the Steam Deck appeared to be everything I’d dreamt of.
“Ready but waiting to go live” is sort of the theme of the Steam Deck beyond Steam itself.
Steam Deck and the freedom to make the most of timeEven in this early stage, the Steam Deck already delivers what I want from a modern portable console.

     Steam Deck Surprised Me, in Ways Both Good and Bad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dan Ackerman/CNETThe Steam Deck is the latest high-profile attempt to do the near-impossible – make a great handheld gaming PC.
The full scope of feature-enhancing tweaks and hacks (or bugs and limitations) won't be apparent until the Steam Deck gets into more hands.
The Steam Deck is made by Valve, the company behind the hugely successful Steam online game store/platform.
Like those first-gen VR headsets, the Steam Deck requires an adventurous spirit and a love for fiddly workarounds.
Steam currently lists it as "playable" on Steam Deck, and indeed it was, even more so than I expected.
