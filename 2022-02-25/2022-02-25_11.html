     Kendall Jenner Debuts a Dramatic New Hair Color on the Prada Runway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As if you needed more proof that copper is the hair color of the moment, today Kendall Jenner unveiled a new shocking red dye job on the Prada runway in Milan.
The 26-year-old model’s freshly dyed red lengths were worn in a sleek, sculptural chignon crafted by Guido Palau above a black plume-embellished coat and sheer gray slip skirt look.
Photo: Courtesy of Guido Palau / @guidopalauIt’s not the first time Jenner has traded in her natural glossy brunette for a transformative new shade—or catapulted it into the spotlight on the catwalk.
Being the trend-setter that she is, Jenner’s new auburn will naturally add proverbial fuel to the fire that is the current obsession with red hair.
Gird your loins for the double-process dye job accordingly.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It's safe to say that Kendall Jenner is one of the most private members of the Kardashian-Jenner family.
The 26-year-old model grew up on reality TV, starring on her family's show Keeping Up With the Kardashians.
But as the highest-paid supermodel in the world with brands of her own, Jenner now has reclaimed some of her power.
In the subsequent photo shoot, Jenner poses entirely nude while lying down in one shot and in several see-through tops while bra-less in others.

     Kendall Jenner Speaks On Lack of ‘Control’ During Childhood
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kendall Jenner recently opened up about being forced to give up "control" during her childhood as part of The Kardashians family empire.
Now as a maturing adult, Kendall is embracing her independence and the power to live life on her own terms.
It's because of her early introduction to TV stardom that Kendall prefers to live a more private life away from the public eye.
As Kendall grew older and became of age, fans started to see less of her on the Keeping Up With the Kardashians show.
With a new show on the way, a flourishing business and modeling career, Kendall doesn't need to rush herself with anything.

     Kendall Jenner Walked The Prada AW22 Show With Red Hair
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This season, it seems Kendall Jenner has succumbed to the winds of change and decided to try out one of the most popular shades of the season, debuting a new copper-toned hair colour at the Prada autumn/winter 2022 show.
The 26-year-old model took to the catwalk in Milan sporting a sleek and lacquered sky-scraping chignon, a look masterminded by the runway's favoured hair stylist, Guido Palau.
Victor VIRGILE Getty ImagesPietro S. D'Aprano Getty ImagesFor those interested in trying a copper shade for yourself, it's imperative to speak to your hair stylist who can advise you on what you can realistically achieve with your current hair shade.
For a lighter red hue such as Jenner's, darker hair tones would have to first be lightened with bleach in order to get the most natural-looking finish.
Always remember to show up to your appointment prepared with image references; giving your hair stylist visuals will allow you to both understand what you want to achieve and save you from disappointment with the outcome.

At 26 years old, Kendall is no longer a shy teenager melting into the couch.
It’s an arguably ordinary act to read in public, but when Kendall reads, it becomes headline news.
“It’s a sad thing to say, but sometimes you almost have to remind yourself who you are,” Kendall says.
“I think doing your own personal work is a really great way of reminding yourself, ‘Oh, no, no, no, no.
