    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NATO activated its response force on Friday amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced that the alliance is “now deploying the NATO Response Force for the first time in a collective defense context.
The response force has as many as 40,000 troops, but Stoltenberg confirmed the entire force would not be deployed at this time, though he also didn't specify how many troops will be involved.

“We have activated NATO’s defence plans to prepare ourselves to respond to a range of contingencies and secure Alliance territory, including by drawing on our response forces,” the leaders added.

     NATO to Deploy Rapid Response Force to Protect Allies Near Russia-Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NATO is deploying some of its combat-ready response force to help protect member nations near Ukraine amid the Russian invasion, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday.
We will do what it takes to protect and defend every ally and every inch of NATO territory," he said.
Stoltenberg made the announcement during a news conference, where he also said that NATO would continue to send weapons to Ukraine.
This will be the first time the organization has ever mobilized its NATO Defense Force (NRF) "in the context of collective defense," Stoltenberg said at the news conference.
He clarified that U.S. troops are not being sent to Europe to fight within Ukraine's borders but to help defend NATO.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Those plans include “drawing on our response forces,” NATO said.
The 5,000-strong unit, formally known as the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, is carved out of NATO’s larger response force of 40,000 troops.
Both the spearhead unit and other elements of the response force will deploy, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.
“We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the Alliance,” the NATO statement said.
Germany typically has been among the most reluctant of NATO allies when it comes to taking military steps that could be viewed as provocative by Moscow.

     NATO chief says alliance deploying parts of quick response force over Russian invasion - National
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Send this page to someone via emailThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will deploy elements of a quick response military force with the goal of preventing “spillover” of the violent and unprovoked war launched by Russia against Ukraine early Thursday morning.
“The Ukrainian forces are fighting bravely and are actually able to inflict damage on the invading Russian forces.
And Stoltenberg said the deployment of “elements” of both the NATO Response Force and the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) specifically is meant to make it clear that no threat to eastern European member states will be tolerated.
That’s exactly why we are now deploying the NATO Response Force for the first time in the collective defence context.”The VJTF is what Stoltenberg described as the “lead element” of the 40,000-strong NATO Response Force.
“The area that we’re deploying to, every other NATO nation is also trying to get in there,” said Day, former commander of Canada’s special forces.

     NATO Deploys Response Forces; Warns Russia ‘We Will Defend Every Inch’ of Alliance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NATO leaders agreed on Friday to immediately deploy elements of the alliance’s emergency military forces, adding troops and firepower to bolster defenses along its Eastern front.
“We have met today to discuss the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades,” NATO leaders said in a joint NATO statement.
“We are now employing elements of the NATO Response Force,” U.S. Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, NATO supreme allied commander, said in a statement.
Military leaders have warned that Russia could provoke or unintentionally spark a confrontation with NATO member forces already on high alert.
NATO leaders have frequently restated their Article V commitment to consider an attack on one member as an attack on all.
