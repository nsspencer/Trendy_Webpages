After co-host Sonny Hostin mentioned the possibility of massive Ukrainian casualties and the potential for a refugee crisis in Europe, Behar said, “I’m scared of what’s going to happen in Western Europe too.
“Joy Behar moans Russia-Ukraine war is making her vacation plans uncertain,” headlined the Post, while the Fox News website went with “Joy Behar complains Russia-Ukraine war making her European vacation plans uncertain.”Watch The View segment above and decide for yourself.

Co-host Sonny Hostin was discussing the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine before Behar whined about her long-delayed travel plans to Italy amid the coronavirus pandemic.
