     Bill Paxton’s Family Agrees to $1 Million Settlement in Lawsuit Over Actor’s 2017 Death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Bill Paxton’s family has reached a settlement with a medical group over the 2017 death of the award-winning film and TV actor.
Per NBC News, the family has reached a $1 million settlement with the General Anesthesia Specialists Partnership medical group, which had previously been added to a wrongful death lawsuit filed in 2018.
The plaintiffs in that suit—which was first filed against Cedars-Sinai—are the Apollo 13 and Twister actor’s widow Louise Paxton as well as children James and Lydia.
The Emmy-nominated Big Love actor’s death was a shock to fans and friends alike, with subsequent reports revealing he had suffered a stroke days after surgery involving a heart valve replacement and an aortic aneurysm.
The film also starred Tom Hanks and Emma Watson, with the former having previously acted alongside Paxton in the aforementioned Apollo 13.

     Bill Paxton’s Death Has Led To A Million-Dollar Settlement￼
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     By Nathan Kamal | 6 seconds agoThe family of late actor Bill Paxton has reached something of a settlement in the lawsuit they filed after his untimely death in 2017.
Now, the medical group has agreed to pay Paxton’s wife and children a $1 million dollar settlement, while also denying liability for the actor’s death.
Bill Paxton in Aliens (1986)Bill Paxton had a long and storied film career, often playing a buffoonish or overconfident figure.
While this partial settlement in the lawsuit concerning Bill Paxton’s death seems to be complete, the lawsuit against Cedars-Sinai Medical Center has still not begun.
RIP Bill Paxton.

     Bill Paxton’s Family Reaches $1M Settlement With Anesthesiologist Group Over Actor’s Death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     An anesthesiologist medical group has settled for $1 million its part in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Bill Paxton’s family over the actor’s death in 2017 following an allegedly botched heart surgery.
General Anesthesia Specialists Partnership maintained that it bears no responsibility in Paxton’s death.
The claims against General Anesthesia Specialists Partnership included wrongful death, survival action and breach of fiduciary duty.
An L.A. judge ruled in January that Paxton’s family can seek punitive damages for claims that the hospital engaged in a cover-up to conceal its negligence.
Attorneys for General Anesthesia Specialists Partnership and Paxton’s family didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
