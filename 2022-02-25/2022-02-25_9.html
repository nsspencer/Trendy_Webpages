     NATO Response Force activated for first time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) For the first time, the NATO Response Force has been activated as a defensive measure in response to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod Wolters activated the multinational force consisting of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies that can deploy quickly in support of the NATO alliance.
The activation of the response troops does not mean that any US or NATO troops will go into Ukraine, which is not a member.
"This is an historic moment and the very first time the Alliance has employed these high readiness forces in a deterrence and defense role.
It's not clear how many troops the response force will contain.

     Thousands of U.S. troops deploying for first-ever NATO Response Force activation amid Russia attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Many of the 7,000 U.S. troops activated Thursday in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will join up with multinational troops as part of the NATO Response Force’s first deployment in its history.
Those troops will head first to Germany, the Pentagon said, but could spread out as NATO determines where they’re most needed.
They will be at least partially committed to the NATO Response Force, Kirby said, but those details are still being worked out.
“And I don’t have an exact breakdown of what is going to be going as a part of this NATO Response Force package because again, we’re still working our way through that,” Kirby said.
With the activation of the NATO Response Force, the U.S. expects to start attaching more troops to that organization, as part of a deterrence effort should Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threaten NATO territory.

     NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced Friday that the alliance has activated elements of the 40,000-troop NATO Response Force (NRF) for the first time, warning at a press conference: "The Kremlin's objectives are not limited to Ukraine."
Why it matters: Stoltenberg has called Russia's invasion of Ukraine "the most serious security crisis we have faced in Europe for decades."
He also said that NATO countries would be providing additional weapons and air-defense systems to Ukraine at the request of its government.
"Russia's attack on Ukraine is more than an attack on Ukraine.
Driving the news: NATO heads of state and government met for an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss security in Ukraine.

     NATO Activates Response Force for First Time as US Readies More Troops
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The U.S. was preparing thousands of troops who could be called upon to support NATO after the alliance on Friday activated a rapid response force in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Pentagon said.
The activation by President Joe Biden and leaders of member states marks the first such use of the NATO Response Force to guard alliance territory, which does not include Ukraine.
The NATO Response Force is described by the organization as a "highly ready and technologically advanced" group of 40,000 troops from member nations.
Progress appeared to be slowing, with Russian troops facing more resistance from Ukrainian forces than anticipated.

     NATO Deploys Response Forces; Warns Russia ‘We Will Defend Every Inch’ of Alliance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NATO leaders agreed on Friday to immediately deploy elements of the alliance’s emergency military forces, adding troops and firepower to bolster defenses along its Eastern front.
“We have met today to discuss the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades,” NATO leaders said in a joint NATO statement.
“We are now employing elements of the NATO Response Force,” U.S. Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, NATO supreme allied commander, said in a statement.
Military leaders have warned that Russia could provoke or unintentionally spark a confrontation with NATO member forces already on high alert.
NATO leaders have frequently restated their Article V commitment to consider an attack on one member as an attack on all.
