     ‘Undercover Boss’ recognizes Dallas pizza manager’s work with youth sports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Anthony McDowell started getting suspicious when the production company documenting his work as a manager at Round Table Pizza near SMU wanted him to fly to Sacramento for a post-production meeting.
McDowell had made an impression on Paul Damico, Round Table’s chief executive officer at the time.
Eventually, the corporate owners had to come clean: The film crew was sent by the CBS reality series Undercover Boss.
Each year, the Round Table Pizza location in Dallas contributes money to the league and allows him time to give attention to it, Stern said.
In McDowell’s role with his youth football league, he works to grow the league, emphasizing sportsmanship, safety and learning fundamentals.
