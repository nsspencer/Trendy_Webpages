     Chelsea Handler skis topless with Canadian flag pastie for her birthday (VIDEO)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Comedian and actress Chelsea Handler took to the slopes for her 47th birthday Friday wearing nothing but her skis, a bikini bottom, and the flags of her three favourite countries.
For nipple coverage, Handler chose one Canadian flag pastie and one American flag pastie, and affixed one flag for each country to her ski helmet.
Although Handler is American, she often spends time in Canada and filmed her topless ski run last year in Whistler.
‚ÄúDoing all the things I love with the man I love,‚Äù Handler captioned her Instagram post.

     Chelsea Handler Hitting the Ski Slopes in Nothing But Her Underwear Is One Inspiring Way to Ring in 47
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Chelsea Handler sure knows how to celebrate a birthday in a way that should inspire people to do their big day however they want.
The comedian‚Äôs choices might not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but it certainly delivered some epic social media footage.
The couple first went Instagram official in September 2021 with the normally reserved Handler gushing about Koy.
That kind of stuff,‚Äù she wrote in an Instagram post.
Now, the love continues into her next year of life as she joyfully barrels down the slopes, topless and with her boyfriend by her side.
