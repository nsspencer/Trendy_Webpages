     The hacking group Anonymous is fighting the Russian government in cyberspace and is taking credit for knocking down the website for RT, the Russian-controlled news network, as the Russian military attacks Ukraine.
The Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom’s website was also inaccessible on Friday and taken offline by Anonymous hackers, according to @LiteMods on Twitter, which is affiliated with Anonymous and has more than 70,000 followers.
Accounts affiliated with the decentralized group of activist hackers shared news of their actions on Twitter and have brainstormed potential targets via the messaging platform Discord.
#Anonymous #Ukraine,” said @YourAnonOne, an Anonymous-affiliated account on Twitter with more than 700,000 followers, on Thursday.
The ransomware gang Conti on Friday said it will act in support of Russia, according to a message shared by cybersecurity professionals on Twitter.

     Anonymous hacktivists, ransomware groups get involved in Ukraine-Russia conflict
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Multiple ransomware groups and members of the hacktivist collective Anonymous announced this week that they are getting involved in the military conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
On Friday, ransomware groups Conti and CoomingProject published messages saying they supported the Russian government.
#Conti #ransomware just changed the phrasing of their statement regarding Russia's support.
Recorded Future expert Allan Liska told ZDNet the threat from ransomware groups deciding to retaliate is real and should be a concern.
But like Liska, Toth-Czifra said ransomware groups openly associating with the Russian government would be a "new and worrying development."
