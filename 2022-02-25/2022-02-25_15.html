     Album review: Avril Lavigne – Love Sux — Kerrang!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The cult of Avril Lavigne is such that people are talking about this seventh album as if the enigmatic Canadian hasn’t released one in yonks, when its predecessor, Head Above Water, only came out in 2019.
Perhaps mindful of the need to compete with her proteges and pretenders, or keen to navigate to pastures relatively new, Love Sux has enough elements to make for a refreshing listen.
Don’t panic, though: this is an Avril Lavigne album in all the ways that matter – chugging but shiny, and augmented by the kind of collaborators you expect from an album of this flavour in 2022.
Least surprising of all is the ubiquitous Machine Gun Kelly, who adds his sneering tones to the excellent Bois Lie.
This formidable act of fan service is completed by Travis Barker being the album’s co-producer – alongside John Feldmann and Mod Sun – with his blink-182 bandmate Mark Hoppus providing a low vocal counterpoint to Avril on the lovely All I Wanted.

     It instantly went viral, with more 35 million plays and almost six million likes.
Amazingly, Lavigne had never met Hawk before they filmed it, simply sliding into his DMs to ask if he'd be up for making a video together.

     Now in her 20th year as a recording artist, the Canadian star says she’s still enjoying that pop-punk life.
“Oh my God, it’s so crazy to hear that,” Avril told GMA.
They’re lovely and I love what they’re dong musically.”The first leg of Avril’s tour starts in Canada in May 3 and wraps up May 27 at the Boston Calling Festival.
In September, she’ll perform at the Firefly Festival in Delaware and in October, she’ll appear at the the all-emo and pop-punk festival When We Were Young in Las Vegas.
She gave the GMA audience a taste of her tour by performing her latest single, “Love It When You Hate Me.”Copyright © 2022, ABC Audio.

It's a really fun time in music, for sure.”And for Glamour's latest installment of 5 Songs, 5 Stories, we dive deeper with Avril Lavigne into how, exactly, that vibe has evolved over the years.
“Complicated”The debut single off her debut album, this was the song that introduced Lavigne to the world.

     Avril Lavigne’s Musical Evolution, From ‘Sk8er Boi’ to ‘Bite Me’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Avril Lavigne — the original pop-punk teen queen — is returning to her rebel roots with “Love Sux,” her seventh studio album out today via Travis Barker’s DTA Records.
In a December interview with Nylon, Lavigne described the 11-track project as the album “I’ve wanted to make for my whole career,” calling it “anthemic” and “powerful.” Indeed, the album’s two singles — “Bite Me” and “Love It When You Hate Me” — recall the in-your-face attitude of Lavigne’s earlier hits, à la “Sk8er Boi” and “Complicated,” while also presenting a more confident, independent woman and artist.
With this release, it truly seems as though Lavigne has come full circle in her 20-year career.
In celebration of “Love Sux,” Variety takes a look back at 13 music moments that showcase Avril Lavigne’s career evolution, from “Sk8er Boi” to “Bite Me.”

     Avril Lavigne Gets Back to Her Aughts Emo Bubble-Punk Roots on the Absolutely Killer ‘Love Sux’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In 2002, Avril Lavigne’s skate-punk aesthetic and emo-but-energized angst quickly made her the queen of the aughts pop-punk revival scene.
Since her third album, 2007’s The Best Damn Thing, she’s ebbed and flowed, dipping her toes in bubblegum pop and more self-serious pop rock.
Her seventh album, Love Sux, brings her back to her roots, bridging the gap between her early emo vibe with the bubblegum confidence that brought her away from it.
Conceptually, Love Sux is about exactly what the title promises: all the ways “bois” suck and lie and break hearts.
Across the board, Lavigne sounds like she’s having good, real fun for the first time in ages.
