     Nvidia confirms it is investigating a cybersecurity incident – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     U.S. chipmaker Nvidia has confirmed that it’s investigating a cyber incident that has reportedly downed the company’s developer tools and email systems.
Nvidia told TechCrunch in a statement that the nature and scope of the incident are still being evaluated, adding that the company’s commercial activities have not been impacted as a result.
“We are investigating an incident.
It’s not yet clear whether hackers obtained data on Nvidia or its customers, nor whether any of its partners were affected.
Nvidia has not yet identified the culprit, and customers say they had not been informed of any incident, according to The Telegraph’s report.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     That includes NVIDIA, which has reportedly been hit by a network intrusion that's taken some of its systems offline.
According to a report by The Telegraph, NVIDIA has suffered multiple days' worth of outages as the result of a cyberattack that's negatively affected both the company's developer tools as well as its email systems.
We don't have any additional information to share at this time," said an NVIDIA spokesperson.
NVIDIA is the maker of some of the best graphics cards on the market and is a major industry player in the chip game.
We will update our coverage in the event NVIDIA shares more information on the reported attack.

     “We are investigating an incident.
Bloomberg is now reporting it was a minor ransomware attack, citing a “person familiar with the incident.”If a US-based company like Nvidia had been targeted, though, it could provoke retaliation from the United States.
While the alleged attack reportedly knocked out Nvidia’s email, we did receive Nvidia’s statement today from an Nvidia email address.
That timing lines up with when The Telegraph reports that Nvidia’s systems were compromised.
Update, 5:47PM ET: Added that Bloomberg is now citing a source that the “incident” was a ransomware attack.

     Nvidia Investigating Potential Cyber Attack Affecting Internal Systems
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Today, we've learned that Nvidia is a potential victim of a ruthless cyber attack.
At this time, it is unclear whether the attack itself forced these internal systems offline or if Nvidia proactively terminated access to quell the threat.
According to its sources within the company, Nvidia's internal systems were "completely compromised."
Unfortunately, there are no additional concrete details on the extent of the cyber attack or whether Nvidia was the victim of ransomware.
The timing of the Nvidia cyber attack has raised a few eyebrows considering the military action carried about by Russia in Ukraine.
