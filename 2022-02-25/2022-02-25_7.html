     Here's What Steve Kerr Said After The Warriors Beat The Trail Blazers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Golden State Warriors crushed the Portland Trail Blazers 132-95 on Thursday evening in their first game back from the All-Star break.
The win improved them to 43-17 in 60 games played on the season, and they are currently the second seed in the Western Conference.
After the game, head coach Steve Kerr spoke to reporters, and a clip of what he said can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Warriors on NBCS.
The Warriors have missed the playoffs in each of the last two seasons (Klay Thompson also missed the last two seasons to injury), but that appears likely to change this year.
They look like one of the legitimate contenders to win the NBA Championship this summer.

     Jacked Ramsays Post Game: Blazers vs Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Portland Trail Blazers’ winning streak ends at four games as they fall 132-95 to the Golden State Warriors on what figures to be an interesting final stretch to the 2021-22 NBA season.
The “Baby Blazers” group of Anfernee Simons, Josh Hart and even Justise Winslow continue to play admirably - Simons in particular put up another star level effort that won’t even register as it becomes the norm - but the loss of Jusuf Nurkic for what will likely be the season and the shortage of top end talent to fill the gaps just proved to be too much for the Warriors who put eight players into double figures and saw Steph Curry post 18 points and an eye popping 14 assists.
Hop on with Danny Marang and Brandon Sprague as they take a look at tonight’s action, the debuts of Keon Johnson, Brandon Williams and Drew Eubanks and the upcoming schedule.

     Stephen Curry, Warriors return from All-Star break to rout Blazers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stephen Curry had 18 points and 14 assists and the Golden State Warriors returned from the All-Star break to rout the Portland Trail Blazers 132-95 on Thursday night.
Eight players finished in double figures — the last time Golden State had as many was in 2009.
Golden State pushed the lead to 20 points and went into the break ahead 70-57.
Added Thompson: "(Curry) has always been able to pass like this.
... Golden State also won the first two of the three-game series with the Blazers.

     One more thing Jonathan Kuminga gives the Golden State Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “​​I’m gonna keep it real,” Kuminga said Thursday after the Warriors’ win over the Blazers.
The secret sauce — something the Warriors are lacking — was 12 trips to the foul line and 10 made free throws.
Nobody but Curry — who shoots 92% on 4.8 attempts per game — averages more than 3.0 points per game at the line.
By making 10 of them — another career high — Kuminga raised his efficiency multiple percentage points to 67.2% for the season.
It’s clear, though, Kuminga has grasped the key concept of Golden State basketball.

     The loading ramp adjacent to the Warriors’ team bus was simply his runway.
Golden State had 36 assists on 45 field goals, improving to 21-1 when recording that many assists.
Golden State has desperately missed Green’s high basketball IQ.
Golden State has the seventh-toughest remaining schedule, with games against the Suns, Heat, Jazz and Bucks still to play.
But if Thursday’s win is any indication, Golden State appears to be right on track.
