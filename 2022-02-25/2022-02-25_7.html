     Amanda Bynes Has Filed A Petition To End Her Conservatorship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Amanda Bynes has filed paperwork to terminate her conservatorship after living under the court-mandated arrangement for more than eight years.
Bynes was first placed under the conservatorship in 2013 after a series of legal issues and an apparent mental health crisis.
Bynes' mother, Lynn Bynes, was ultimately named temporary conservator of the actor's finances and personal life in August 2013.
Arminak said in an email that Amanda Bynes' petition was "based on professionals’ opinion and assessment of the situation."
Last year, during Britney Spears' fight to be freed from her nearly 14-year conservatorship, Bynes' case received renewed attention.

     Amanda Bynes files petition to end conservatorship, has parents' support
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Actor Amanda Bynes is seeking to end her 9-year conservatorship, and she's doing so with her parents' approval.
Bynes filed a petition Wednesday at Ventura County Superior Court in California to terminate the conservatorship of her person and estate.
An attorney for Bynes' parents said they will not attend the virtual hearing but they support their daughter's decision and will agree to her request to end the conservatorship.
Bynes, 35, has been in a conservatorship under her parents, Lynn and Rick Bynes, since 2013 amid substance abuse issues, controversial Twitter rants, and legal troubles.
While living in the apartment community, Bynes underwent random toxicology screenings, weekly apartment checks and check-ins with her case manager.

     Amanda Bynes Wants to End Her Conservatorship, Too
    </h2>

     Photo: Lars Niki/Corbis via Getty ImagesAmanda Bynes is petitioning to end her conservatorship.
According to “Page Six,” Bynes filed documents Wednesday asking the court to terminate the court-ordered conservatorship that has placed her under the control of her mother and legal guardian, Lynn Bynes, for almost nine years.
While Bynes regained control of her financial assets in 2017, her mother remains in charge of all personal decisions including her health care.
Bynes’s petition follows Britney Spears’s highly publicized mission to end her own restrictive conservatorship, which was finally lifted in November after 13 years.
Like Bynes, Spears had been put on a 5150 hold in 2008 before her conservatorship began.
