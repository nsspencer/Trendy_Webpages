     Here's What Steve Kerr Said After The Warriors Beat The Trail Blazers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Golden State Warriors crushed the Portland Trail Blazers 132-95 on Thursday evening in their first game back from the All-Star break.
The win improved them to 43-17 in 60 games played on the season, and they are currently the second seed in the Western Conference.
After the game, head coach Steve Kerr spoke to reporters, and a clip of what he said can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Warriors on NBCS.
The Warriors have missed the playoffs in each of the last two seasons (Klay Thompson also missed the last two seasons to injury), but that appears likely to change this year.
They look like one of the legitimate contenders to win the NBA Championship this summer.

     Jacked Ramsays Post Game: Blazers vs Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Portland Trail Blazers’ winning streak ends at four games as they fall 132-95 to the Golden State Warriors on what figures to be an interesting final stretch to the 2021-22 NBA season.
The “Baby Blazers” group of Anfernee Simons, Josh Hart and even Justise Winslow continue to play admirably - Simons in particular put up another star level effort that won’t even register as it becomes the norm - but the loss of Jusuf Nurkic for what will likely be the season and the shortage of top end talent to fill the gaps just proved to be too much for the Warriors who put eight players into double figures and saw Steph Curry post 18 points and an eye popping 14 assists.
Hop on with Danny Marang and Brandon Sprague as they take a look at tonight’s action, the debuts of Keon Johnson, Brandon Williams and Drew Eubanks and the upcoming schedule.

     Warriors assign James Wiseman to Santa Cruz for practice, scrimmage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Warriors’ James Wiseman is taking another big stride toward his eventual return to the court with the postseason quickly approaching.
He was scheduled to participate in a practice and scrimmage Friday, but will not play in Santa Cruz’s home game against Birmingham on Saturday.
It comes just days after Wiseman, who has not appeared in a game this season, participated in a 12-minute full-contact scrimmage during the Warriors’ trip to Portland.
After the scrimmage, Kerr shared a promising outlook on Wiseman.
In the 39 games he played before the knee injury ended his rookie season, Wiseman averaged 11.5 points and 5.8 rebounds in 21.4 minutes per game.

     Warriors news: Stephen Curry sets PG record thanks to Klay Thompson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There’s a school of thought that doesn’t consider Stephen Curry a true point guard.
But the Golden State Warriors icon just made point guard history thanks to his co-star Klay Thompson.
Klay Thompson relocates and Steph Curry finds him for three 🔥 pic.twitter.com/KOPIT0WLAJ — ClutchPoints (@ClutchPointsApp) February 25, 2022That assist to Klay gave Steph Curry entry to a prestigious point guard milestone in NBA history.
Why does Stephen Curry get discredited as a PG just because he’s so darn good at something else?
Stephen Curry has averaged 6.5 assists per game for his Warriors career that’s spanned over a decade now.

     One more thing Jonathan Kuminga gives the Golden State Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “​​I’m gonna keep it real,” Kuminga said Thursday after the Warriors’ win over the Blazers.
The secret sauce — something the Warriors are lacking — was 12 trips to the foul line and 10 made free throws.
Nobody but Curry — who shoots 92% on 4.8 attempts per game — averages more than 3.0 points per game at the line.
By making 10 of them — another career high — Kuminga raised his efficiency multiple percentage points to 67.2% for the season.
It’s clear, though, Kuminga has grasped the key concept of Golden State basketball.

Mandatory Credit: Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY SportsBrace yourself Golden State Warriors fans, James Wiseman’s return to the floor appears to be imminent.
The Golden State Warriors are hoping James Wiseman’s road to recovery is nearly finished as the young center nears a return.
Once Draymond Green returns, Golden State will be at full strength and Wiseman can fill in as a consistent paint presence that compliments the Splash Brothers.
However, it also makes sense for the Warriors to hold on a bit longer and allow Wiseman to get his feet wet in the G-League.
