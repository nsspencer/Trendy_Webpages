    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Watch : Hayden Panettiere Returns to Instagram With a New LookAmid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Hayden Panettiere has confirmed that her daughter Kaya is out of harm's way.
The Heroes actress' 7-year-old daughter typically lives with her dad, Hayden's ex Wladimir Klitschko, in Ukraine.
When a fan shared their concern over Kaya's safety in a comment on Hayden's Instagram on Friday, Feb. 25, the actress replied, "She's safe and not in the Ukraine."
In an Instagram post on Thursday, Feb. 24, Hayden's ex stated that he was currently located in Ukraine's capital Kyiv, where he said, "European way of life is under threat, the freedom of peoples to make their own decisions is under threat and so is democracy."
In addition to showing support for Wladimir's comments by posting them onto her Instagram Story on Friday, the Nashville actress also shared her own thoughts about the Ukraine crisis on Instagram, calling Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions "an absolute disgrace."

     “I don’t have another choice,” Vitali, the 50-year-old mayor of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, said on ITV’s “Good Morning Britain.”“I have to do that.
I would fight.”Meanwhile, Wladimir, 45, enlisted in Ukraine’s reserve army in the capital earlier this month amid Russia’s escalating threats to the country.
“Nasvhille” actress Panettiere, 32, reposted comments Wladimir made about the conflict on Instagram to her own IG Story Friday.
Panettiere and the Hall of Fame boxer got engaged in 2013 and welcomed Kaya in 2014, splitting in August 2018.
A rep for the actress told us in 2019 that she “regularly” sees Kaya and spends “substantial time” with her in the United States and Ukraine.
