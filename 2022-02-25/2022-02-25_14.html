     Big Ten Basketball Preview: Iowa at Nebraska
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Iowa will look to continue its winning ways as it travels to Lincoln, Nebraska to take on Nebraska on Friday, Feb. 25.
The Hawkeyes enter this game on a two-game winning streak and have won five of their last six games.
Iowa is 19-8 on the season and 9-7 in Big Ten play while Nebraska is 7-20 and 1-15 in Big Ten play.
Iowa handled Nebraska from the jump as it cruised to a 98-75 victory on Super Bowl Sunday.
Since then, the Hawkeyes fell to Michigan at home, but Iowa took down Ohio State on the road and then Michigan State at home earlier this week.

     Red-hot Iowa basketball pulls away from Nebraska, secures 20-win season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     — For the first time in more than seven years, Fran McCaffery’s Iowa basketball team has emerged from Pinnacle Bank Arena victorious.
The Hawkeyes shook off some dubious history here, pulling away in the second half for an 88-78 win Friday night.
In the process, the Hawkeyes delivered their fourth straight 20-win season as they inched closer to an NCAA Tournament bid.
The Cornhuskers raced to a 28-21 lead, and Iowa was generous with seven first-half turnovers.
That Iowa team won its final six Big Ten games to go from 6-6 to 12-6 last year.

     February Fright: #25 Iowa 88, Nebraska 78
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It wasn’t easy, but the #25 Iowa Hawkeyes (20-8, 10-7) beat the cellar dwelling Nebraska Cornhuskers (7-21, 1-16) 88-78 behind a body swapping performance from the McCafferies and a career night for Tony Perkins.
The Hawkeyes struggled with turnovers in the first half, nearly matching their season average (8.8) with seven in the frame.
Defensively, they were a half step slow for much of the frame, including a couple whiffs on steals.
Iowa struggled to extend the lead throughout much of the second half but were buoyed throughout by extra possessions on the offensive glass.
The Hawkeye defense had its moments, but did struggle with fouls as four Alonzo Verge free throws cut the Iowa lead to nine.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The men’s basketball team has won five of its last six games.
Have we all lowered our expectations for what Iowa basketball can achieve?
I wouldn’t say Fran McCaffery has received a pass from Iowa fans about his lack of NCAA tournament success.
Iowa has won its last four NCAA tournament openers and the only first-round loss under McCaffery was in overtime.
In Big Ten play the last 10 years, Iowa, Michigan State and Wisconsin are tied for the fewest losing seasons (one).
