     Hacking Group Anonymous Declares Cyber War On Russia For Invading Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The international hacking collective Anonymous has declared a cyberwar against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.
The loosely affiliated group of hackers posted their intentions on the YourAnonNews Twitter account, saying some of its members are "currently involved in operations against the Russian Federation."
There is an inevitability that the private sector will most likely be affected too," the group tweeted.
The group has not posted information about any future attacks or if it plans to go beyond taking websites offline.
So, if you're new around here and are thinking about participating in online adventures against Russia yet don't know a damn thing about maintaining your own online privacy: Don't," they tweeted.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     First down in the internett-attack, said to be a response to the Ukraine War, was the Kremlin-backed TV channel RT.com.
The RT is considered a major propaganda channel for the Putin regime.
Since Friday afternoon, also the portal of Russia’s Defense Ministry has been down, returning the 418 HTTP error code.
Anonymous explains in its Twitter feed that it is not the Russian people that are targeted.
Saturday morning, the Russian troops are reportedly in the outskirts of Kyiv but are met with strong resistance.

I'll stay out of the politics of this as I'm just reporting the news, but Anonymous is reportedly pushing into a "full-scale" cyberattack against the Russian Federation.
It is time for the Russian people to stand together and say "NO" to Vladimir Putin's war".

     The hacking group Anonymous is fighting the Russian government in cyberspace and is taking credit for knocking down the website for RT, the Russian-controlled news network, as the Russian military attacks Ukraine.
The Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom’s website was also inaccessible on Friday and taken offline by Anonymous hackers, according to @LiteMods on Twitter, which is affiliated with Anonymous and has more than 70,000 followers.
Accounts affiliated with the decentralized group of activist hackers shared news of their actions on Twitter and have brainstormed potential targets via the messaging platform Discord.
#Anonymous #Ukraine,” said @YourAnonOne, an Anonymous-affiliated account on Twitter with more than 700,000 followers, on Thursday.
The ransomware gang Conti on Friday said it will act in support of Russia, according to a message shared by cybersecurity professionals on Twitter.

     Anonymous hacktivists, ransomware groups get involved in Ukraine-Russia conflict
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Multiple ransomware groups and members of the hacktivist collective Anonymous announced this week that they are getting involved in the military conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
On Friday, ransomware groups Conti and CoomingProject published messages saying they supported the Russian government.
#Conti #ransomware just changed the phrasing of their statement regarding Russia's support.
Recorded Future expert Allan Liska told ZDNet the threat from ransomware groups deciding to retaliate is real and should be a concern.
But like Liska, Toth-Czifra said ransomware groups openly associating with the Russian government would be a "new and worrying development."
