     Adrian Wojnarowski reports on Knicks guard Derrick Rose missing additional time after suffering a setback in his recovery from a right ankle injury.
(0:51)NEW YORK -- Derrick Rose had another procedure on his right ankle Friday, this time to address a skin infection just as it appeared he was close to returning to the New York Knicks.
The procedure Rose had on Friday was to address an infection in the area where the December surgery had been done.
Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said Rose wasn't in pain but was feeling discomfort.
The Knicks have struggled to find consistency at point guard without him.

     NEW YORK (AP) — Derrick Rose had another procedure on his right ankle Friday, this time to address a skin infection just as it appeared he was close to returning to the New York Knicks.
Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said Rose wasn’t in pain but was feeling discomfort.
“So, just one of those things.”No timetable was given for Rose’s return and Thibodeau said he had no details other than the procedure had gone well.
Derrick Rose will undergo a minor procedure on his right ankle today.
Rose helped jump-start the Knicks last season after arriving in a midseason trade, finishing third in voting for the Sixth Man Award.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The last hope to save the Knicks’ season has been dashed.
Point guard Derrick Rose is out again before he ever got back.
According to a source, Rose visited an ankle specialist after the team’s practice and more damage was found in his right ankle.
Now, the Knicks might just deviate into tank mode and start rookie Miles McBride at point guard.
Alec Burks was to start at point guard Friday with Immanuel Quickley as backup.

     Knicks’ Quentin Grimes exits with partially dislocated right patella
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     One of the Knicks’ few bright spots this season got off to an inauspicious start coming out of the All-Star break.
Emerging rookie guard Quentin Grimes suffered a subluxation of his right patella — a partially dislocated kneecap — in the first quarter of the Knicks’ 115-100 loss to the Heat on Friday night.
Grimes, the Knicks’ first-round pick in 2021, has become a Thibodeau favorite for his tough defense and sharp 3-point shooting.
“That’s tough, man,” said Julius Randle, who was one of the Knicks who tended to Grimes on the far baseline.
Hopefully it’s not too bad and hopefully he’s back on the court soon.”

The win also extended the Heat's road winning streak to six games, dating back to Feb. 3.
The Knicks opened the game on a 10-0 run, led 32-30 at the end of the first quarter and didn't trail until the Heat mounted a 22-4 run to take a 54-40 lead.
Gabe Vincent had a team-high six points during the outburst, including the 3-pointer that put Miami ahead for good at 39-38 with 9:14 left.
The Knicks were 1-for-8 from the field with three turnovers during the Heat's run before Barrett outscored Miami 15-11 over the final 4:11 to pull the hosts within 65-55.

Still, RJ Barrett gave the MSG faithful a hell of a show, scoring 30 points in the first half en route to a 46-point performance in a 115-100.
RJ Barrett joins Carl Braun as the only Knicks 21 and under to record a 40 point game.
