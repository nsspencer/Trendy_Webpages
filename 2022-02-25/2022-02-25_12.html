     As these rumors circulated, so did a miscaptioned video supposedly showing the Ghost of Kyiv in action:Ukrainian pilot who is 6-0 shoots down a Russian Su-35 with his Mig-29.
He‚Äôs been nicknamed the ghost of Kyiv, and is the first pilot since WW2 to achieve ace status!
pic.twitter.com/WsoadzLrdQ ‚Äî Olegi21 üá∫üá¶üíôüíõ (@ItsOlegi21) February 25, 2022This is not a genuine video of the Ghost of Kyiv.
The video was originally posted to YouTube by ‚ÄúComrade_Corb.‚Äù The original caption identified this clip as a simulation and noted that it was created as an homage to the Ghost of Kyiv.
While this video does not feature genuine footage, the general of the Ukrainian armed forces claimed that they had truly downed several Russian aircraft.

     Ghost of Kyiv Ukraine Video is a Fake Made Using Digital Combat Simulator Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While the war in Ukraine rages on, exploits of the "Ghost of Kyiv" are becoming famous.
While the claims seem unsubstantiated, a video has surfaced on the internet, capturing the Ghost getting a kill over Kyiv: it has now been proven to be false, filmed in the game Digital Combat Simulator.
Digital Combat Simulator is a popular combat flight simulator, the evolution of the once famed Lock On: Modern Air Combat.
The video is false, being taken from a YouTube clip filmed in the DCS flight simulator; interestingly, a video from ARMA 3 has a similar story.
Digital Combat Simulator is available for PC now.

     Moreover, the Pentagon also assesses that Russia has not achieved air superiority, and Ukraine still has significant air defense capability left.
Right now, however, the only evidence of any of this is a series of videos showing actual and purported Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29s over Kyiv and elsewhere.
Ukrainian Ministry of Defense A fully armed Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29.
For the record, it‚Äôs worth noting that the Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 fleet, in pre-invasion times, was based at Vasylkiv, in the Kyiv Oblast of central Ukraine, and at Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine.
As for Kyiv‚Äôs supposed super fighter pilot, there is nothing of that account that is credible at this moment.
