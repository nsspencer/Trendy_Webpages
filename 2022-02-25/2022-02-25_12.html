    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     U.S. chipmaker Nvidia has confirmed that it’s investigating a cyber incident that has reportedly downed the company’s developer tools and email systems.
Nvidia told TechCrunch in a statement that the nature and scope of the incident are still being evaluated, adding that the company’s commercial activities have not been impacted as a result.
“We are investigating an incident.
It’s not yet clear whether hackers obtained data on Nvidia or its customers, nor whether any of its partners were affected.
Nvidia has not yet identified the culprit, and customers say they had not been informed of any incident, according to The Telegraph’s report.

     Chipmaker Nvidia probes possible cyberattack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dive Brief:Nvidia is investigating a cybersecurity incident that reportedly impacted operations at the leading U.S. chipmaker in recent days.
The Telegraph on Friday reported that an incident may have "completely compromised" internal Nvidia systems.
"We are investigating an incident," a Nvidia spokesman told Cybersecurity Dive by email.
Last week, Nvidia reported fiscal fourth-quarter non-GAAP profits was up 71% from a year ago to $3.3 billion, while revenues increased 53% to $7.6 billion.
Nvidia was one of many suppliers hit by supply chain constraints last year driven, in part, by demand, which limited its revenue.

     “We are investigating an incident.
Bloomberg is now reporting it was a minor ransomware attack, citing a “person familiar with the incident.”If a US-based company like Nvidia had been targeted, though, it could provoke retaliation from the United States.
While the alleged attack reportedly knocked out Nvidia’s email, we did receive Nvidia’s statement today from an Nvidia email address.
That timing lines up with when The Telegraph reports that Nvidia’s systems were compromised.
Update, 5:47PM ET: Added that Bloomberg is now citing a source that the “incident” was a ransomware attack.

     Nvidia Hack ‘Completely Compromised’ Internal Systems: Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Nvidia had its internal systems “completely compromised” by a potential cyberattack that has taken parts of its business offline for two days, The Telegraph reported.
It is unclear if any data has been stolen or deleted from Nvidia or its clients, or if the attack merely disrupted the semiconductor manufacturer’s systems, The Telegraph reported.
“Security breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks continue to become more prevalent and sophisticated,” Nvidia wrote in a regulatory filing.
Nvidia brought in a third-party expert to probe the impact of the SolarWinds breach but wasn’t able to identify any adverse impact to Nvidia.
That contributed to Nvidia hitting a record $26.9 billion of sales in fiscal 2022, a 61 percent increase from the previous fiscal year.
