     Vergecast: reviews for the Steam Deck and Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Every Friday, The Verge publishes our flagship podcast, The Vergecast, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.
This week is a pretty gadget-heavy episode about some heavy gadgets.
Senior reports editor Sean Hollister starts the show with his review of the Steam Deck, the latest portable gaming system.
Sean explains how it was the hardest review he's done and why he decided to give it a 6.5 score, despite the amount of fun he had using it.
You can listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full discussion.

     Steam Deck Demand is Exceeding Valve's Expectations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After months of build-up, the Steam Deck was released today, with systems beginning to ship to customers that reserved an order.
As a result, many gamers will soon be getting their first chance to go hands-on with the portable gaming PC.
In an interview with IGN, Newell discussed the demand for the Steam Deck as well as the future for the system.
In addition, the co-founder said that the future for the Steam Deck and portable gaming was looking bright.
This is big news for those that purchased a Steam Deck as this game developed by FromSoftware is a next-gen title.

     Valve Steam Deck Review: Glitchy but Promising
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Since then, I've amassed a vast library of games on Steam, the platform created by Valve; it's how most people play games on their computers.
I was intrigued when Valve announced the Steam Deck last year, a handheld portable gaming console that lets you play your PC games anywhere.
It means the software needs more work, but it also shows how committed Valve is to the Steam Deck.
Bulky MachinePhotograph: ValveI received the top-end Steam Deck that retails for $649, which includes a 512-gigabyte solid-state drive.
This Steam Deck is bulky, but not as heavy as I had imagined nor as uncomfortable to hold.

     Review: The real star feature of Valve’s Steam Deck is its price tag
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (Steam Deck UI screenshot)Several other games simply refused to run on my Deck, or were unplayable once they did.
Fight clubThe Steam Deck, out of the box, has Bluetooth compatibility and a single USB-C port.
(Steam Deck UI image)To some extent, this is a review in progress.
For another, I’d argue that the real marquee feature of the Steam Deck isn’t its portability, but its price point.
You may not need a Steam Deck, but you probably know a college student or newbie gamer who could use one.

     The Steam Deck is my new favorite console
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Steam Deck has the greatest launch lineup everOut of the box, the Steam Deck connects to Steam and its thousands of games, including any you may have purchased over the past decade and a half in your Steam library.
But the Steam Deck isn’t quite a portable game console — it’s a portable gaming PC.
For better and worse, the Steam Deck is a PCYes, for a moment, the Steam Deck appeared to be everything I’d dreamt of.
“Ready but waiting to go live” is sort of the theme of the Steam Deck beyond Steam itself.
Steam Deck and the freedom to make the most of timeEven in this early stage, the Steam Deck already delivers what I want from a modern portable console.

     Steam Deck Surprised Me, in Ways Both Good and Bad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dan Ackerman/CNETThe Steam Deck is the latest high-profile attempt to do the near-impossible – make a great handheld gaming PC.
The full scope of feature-enhancing tweaks and hacks (or bugs and limitations) won't be apparent until the Steam Deck gets into more hands.
The Steam Deck is made by Valve, the company behind the hugely successful Steam online game store/platform.
Like those first-gen VR headsets, the Steam Deck requires an adventurous spirit and a love for fiddly workarounds.
Steam currently lists it as "playable" on Steam Deck, and indeed it was, even more so than I expected.

     Steam Deck review: it’s not ready
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Both of these things are true:First, I’m having more fun with the Steam Deck than any gadget I’ve tested in years.
That’s not the Steam Deck that exists today — and not just because the Steam Deck is an absolute chonk that can practically fit a Switch between its grips.
I downloaded Chrome and Slack and Discord and worked from the Steam Deck, writing this entire post for The Verge.
But if early access isn’t your beverage of choice, you might just want to wait for a Steam Deck 2.
So far, that’s the one part of the Steam Deck that’s largely working out, and I can only hope it’ll get better.
