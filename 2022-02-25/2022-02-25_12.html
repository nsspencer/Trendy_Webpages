     Bostin Loyd dead and obituary, RIP to a great one ‚Äì cause of death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     I‚Äôm recognized as one of the most controversial figures in the bodybuilding industry.
Competitive bodybuilding is different from when I started my career.
These tough conversations forced many to realize that steroids are a huge part of the bodybuilding world, and that protein powder and weightlifting aren‚Äôt enough to build an elite physique.
Since I put this video out, a lot of people who have been silent have finally softened up a bit.
Well, about myself, I hope everyone is connected and ready to change their outlook on life and achieve some goals!
