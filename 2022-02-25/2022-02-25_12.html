     NATO announces first-ever activation of Response Force in eastern Europe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     North Atlantic Treaty Organization leadership activated its Response Force for the first time ever to support Ukraine amid an invasion by Russia, CNN reported Friday.
But the move does not mean that any NATO troops, including U.S. troops, will be deployed into Ukraine.
Instead, they will reportedly go to strategic areas in eastern Europe, "to help bolster NATO countries nervous about Russia's aggressive actions."
The entire NATO Response Force is made up of 40,000 troops, though it is unclear how many troops will be deployed.
NATO Secretary General Jens Soltenberg said Friday the first-ever activation was a move to combat "a full fledged invasion of Ukraine," and "further strengthen our posture and to respond quickly to any contingency."

     NATO to Deploy Rapid Response Force to Protect Allies Near Russia-Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NATO is deploying some of its combat-ready response force to help protect member nations near Ukraine amid the Russian invasion, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday.
We will do what it takes to protect and defend every ally and every inch of NATO territory," he said.
Stoltenberg made the announcement during a news conference, where he also said that NATO would continue to send weapons to Ukraine.
This will be the first time the organization has ever mobilized its NATO Defense Force (NRF) "in the context of collective defense," Stoltenberg said at the news conference.
He clarified that U.S. troops are not being sent to Europe to fight within Ukraine's borders but to help defend NATO.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Those plans include “drawing on our response forces,” NATO said.
The 5,000-strong unit, formally known as the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, is carved out of NATO’s larger response force of 40,000 troops.
Both the spearhead unit and other elements of the response force will deploy, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.
“We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the Alliance,” the NATO statement said.
Germany typically has been among the most reluctant of NATO allies when it comes to taking military steps that could be viewed as provocative by Moscow.

     For the first time in history, NATO activates 'Response Force' to protect member nations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     BRUSSELS (AP) — U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts agreed Friday to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank by sending parts of the organization’s response force to help protect them following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Speaking after chairing the summit, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the leaders decided to send parts of the NATO Response Force and elements of a quickly deployed spearhead unit to member nations in Europe.
The NRF can number up to 40,000 troops, but Stoltenberg said that NATO would not be deploying the entire force.
Parts of a force known in NATO jargon as the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), which is currently led by France, will also be sent.
“We are now deploying the NATO Response Force for the first time in a collective defense context.
