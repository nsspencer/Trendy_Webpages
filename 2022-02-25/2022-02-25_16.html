     Iowa basketball: Connor McCaffery is a 'game-changer' when his shot is falling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In 2022, he's starting to take on more of a scoring role as of late and it has paid dividends.
Dating back to Iowa's win against Ohio State, McCaffery has now made six straight threes.
"He's the kind of guy that does so many things to help you win," Fran McCaffery said.
Fran McCaffery has been coach in eight of those seasons, per Daily Iowan's Robert Read.
I don't think it brings us down and (Fran McCaffery) should be in discussion (for Big Ten Coach of the Year).

     February Fright: #25 Iowa 88, Nebraska 78
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It wasn’t easy, but the #25 Iowa Hawkeyes (20-8, 10-7) beat the cellar dwelling Nebraska Cornhuskers (7-21, 1-16) 88-78 behind a body swapping performance from the McCafferies and a career night for Tony Perkins.
The Hawkeyes struggled with turnovers in the first half, nearly matching their season average (8.8) with seven in the frame.
Defensively, they were a half step slow for much of the frame, including a couple whiffs on steals.
Iowa struggled to extend the lead throughout much of the second half but were buoyed throughout by extra possessions on the offensive glass.
The Hawkeye defense had its moments, but did struggle with fouls as four Alonzo Verge free throws cut the Iowa lead to nine.

     Red-hot Iowa basketball pulls away from Nebraska, secures 20-win season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     — For the first time in more than seven years, Fran McCaffery’s Iowa basketball team has emerged from Pinnacle Bank Arena victorious.
The Hawkeyes shook off some dubious history here, pulling away in the second half for an 88-78 win Friday night.
In the process, the Hawkeyes delivered their fourth straight 20-win season as they inched closer to an NCAA Tournament bid.
“But we’re just going to keep plugging.”While Connor McCaffery provided the first-half juice for Iowa, Tony Perkins provided the second-half sauce.
That Iowa team won its final six Big Ten games to go from 6-6 to 12-6 last year.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Hawkeyes take care of Rutgers, and the regular-season finale against Michigan is for all (well, at least some) of the marblesMcKenna Warnock and the Iowa Hawkeyes will play for the Big Ten regular-season women’s basketball title in front of a sellout crowd Sunday at Carver-Hawkeye Arena against Michigan.
The University of Iowa announced Friday morning all tickets for Sunday’s Michigan-Iowa women’s basketball game have been purchased.
Thanks to Iowa’s 88-78 win over Rutgers on Thursday, Sunday’s game has massive, and yet simple, title implications.
“That’s the highest-percentage shot in all of basketball.”McKenna Warnock posted her third straight big game since returning from a broken left hand, tallying 19 points.
Seniors Tomi Taiwo and Logan Cook will be recognized after Sunday’s game.

     Have Iowa fans lowered their expectations for what the men's basketball team can achieve? Hawkeyes mailbag
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The men’s basketball team has won five of its last six games.
Have we all lowered our expectations for what Iowa basketball can achieve?
I wouldn’t say Fran McCaffery has received a pass from Iowa fans about his lack of NCAA tournament success.
Iowa has won its last four NCAA tournament openers and the only first-round loss under McCaffery was in overtime.
In Big Ten play the last 10 years, Iowa, Michigan State and Wisconsin are tied for the fewest losing seasons (one).
