     Cuba Gooding Jr. Pleads Guilty to Forcible Touching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The actor Cuba Gooding Jr., who had been accused by more than 20 women of groping or forcibly kissing them in encounters that dated back more than two decades, pleaded guilty in Manhattan on Wednesday to one count of forcible touching.
The count, a misdemeanor, charged that he had forcibly kissed a woman at a nightclub in Manhattan in 2018.
Under terms of the plea, Mr. Gooding must continue for six more months in alcohol and behavior modification treatment that he has been undergoing since 2019, and he must have no new arrests, the Manhattan district attorney’s office said.
If he fulfills the terms of the plea, he can then withdraw the plea and plead to a lesser charge of harassment, a violation, with a sentence of time served, the office said.
Also, the record of the plea will not be sealed, the office said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Actor Cuba Gooding Jr. entered a plea of guilty on Wednesday to a misdemeanor charge of forcibly touching a woman at a New York City nightclub in 2018.
Gooding admitted to kissing the woman, a waitress at the club, on her lips without consent.
Under the terms of the plea agreement, Gooding is to continue alcohol and behavior modification treatment for six months and have no new arrests.
If he successfully follows the terms and re-pleads to the lesser charge, Gooding can face a sentence to time served.
"Cuba Gooding Jr. entered into a re-pleader today whereby in six months his case will be disposed of with a violation, which is not a crime, resulting in no criminal record," Gooding's attorney, Peter Toumbekis, said in a statement to CNN.
