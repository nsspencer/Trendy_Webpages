     Derek Carr, Raiders agree to three-year, $121.5 million contract extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nearly a month after orchestrating a blockbuster trade to reunite quarterback Derek Carr with college teammate and five-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Davante Adams, the Las Vegas Raiders have taken care of their quarterback in another big way.
Carr and the team on Wednesday agreed to a three-year contract extension worth $121.5 million, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to USA TODAY Sports.
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose financial terms of the agreement.
Carr was entering the final year of his contract and set to earn $19.77 million.
In January, the Raiders hired former New England Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who has publicly professed his support for Carr.

     Raiders sign QB Derek Carr to multi-year extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HENDERSON, Nev. – The Las Vegas Raiders have signed QB Derek Carr to a multi-year contract extension, the club announced Wednesday.
"Derek Carr has been the leader of this franchise for a long time and we are thrilled to continue that relationship moving forward," said Raiders Head Coach Josh McDaniels.
It is clear how much Derek cares about this organization, his teammates and winning.
In 2021, Carr recorded a career-high and franchise-record 4,804 passing yards and was the only quarterback in the league to finish among the top five in both passing yards and completion percentage (68.4).
He tied a career-high with six 300-yard passing games and orchestrated six game-winning drives.

Carr and the Raiders have agreed to terms on a three-year contract extension worth $121.5 million, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo reported Wednesday.
Carr's extension runs through the 2025 season and includes a no-trade clause, per Rapoport and Garafolo.
Carr is set to earn an average of $40.5 million per year under his new extension, ranking fifth among all quarterbacks in average annual salary.

     Raiders finally treat Derek Carr as franchise QB with new contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jay Biggerstaff/USA TODAY SportsThe counterargument to handing Carr a fistful of money ignores how much better he’s become amid the storms.
Under McDaniels, who will theoretically borrow heavily from the Patriots’ individualistic, matchup-based offense, we could see the best of what Carr has to offer.
At least that is the hope when you treat Carr like a franchise quarterback for the first time in his adult life.
So it goes for Carr, who arrives in the short-term oasis of franchise player-dom after eight long seasons.
What happens now that he has all of the resources and stability of a top-five player at the position?

     Summary: HENDERSON, Nev. -- Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr signed a multiyear contract extension Wednesday.
The Raiders did not disclose terms of the deal, but a source confirmed to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that Carr agreed to a three-year, $121.5 million extension that includes a no-trade clause and runs through the 2025 season.
He signed a five-year, $125 million extension in 2017 that was, at the time, the richest contract in NFL history.
His new money average per year of $40.5 million (for the extension only) ranks fifth among NFL quarterbacks.
"I went through a heartbreak the last time I signed my contract -- my best friend left [Khalil Mack]," he said.
