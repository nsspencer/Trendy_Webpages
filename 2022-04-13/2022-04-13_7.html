     Alyssa Nakken Adds Yet Another First by Coaching First Base
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was an unusual scene at Oracle Park in San Francisco on Tuesday.
Hosmer clearly understood the significance of the moment: Alyssa Nakken had become the first woman to coach on the field in a Major League Baseball game.
Nakken, 31, is no stranger to firsts.
An assistant coach on Manager Gabe Kapler‚Äôs staff since 2020, she was already the first woman to have a full-time coaching role in the majors.
After Tuesday‚Äôs game, which the Giants won, 13-2, she talked about the significance of the move while also making it clear that it was well within the scope of her job duties.

     Summary: Alyssa Nakken becomes the first woman to coach on the field in MLB historyEnlarge this image toggle caption Ezra Shaw/Getty Images Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesWhile San Francisco Giants fans may have enjoyed their team's 13-2 home victory over the San Diego Padres Tuesday night, a different type of win came when Giants assistant coach Alyssa Nakken took over as first base coach, becoming the first woman to coach on the field in major league baseball history.
After Giants regular first-base coach Antoan Richardson was ejected from the game at the top of the third inning, Nakken was called in to replace him.
It became another milestone for the coach who was already the league's first full-time female coach.
Nakken became an assistant coach in 2020 after working in the team's front office.
But for the Giants' assistant coach, Tuesday night was just another day at the office.

     Who is Alyssa Nakken? Giants assistant is first woman on-field coach in MLB history

     Summary: On July 20, 2020, Nakken took her place in the Giants' first-base coaching box in the final innings of an exhibition game against the A's, becoming the first woman to coach on the field in MLB history.
Congrats, Alyssa Nakken üëè pic.twitter.com/pzW7NKHTwb ‚Äî SF Giants on NBCS (@NBCSGiants) April 13, 2022Some things are worth the wait: Nakken was named to the Giants' coaching staff in January 2020, though she wouldn't see the field officially until the Giants-Padres matchup on Tuesday night.
Nakken, hired to the Giants' coaching staff in January 2020, became the first woman to be named a coach on an MLB staff.
While her official title is assistant coach, Nakken had the opportunity to coach first base for a few innings during the Giants' final exhibition game against the Athletics on July 20, 2020.
After taking the field on Tuesday, April 12, 2022, Nakken became the first woman to coach on-field during a regular season game at the major league level.

     Giants' Alyssa Nakken becomes first woman to coach on field in regular-season MLB game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She now serves as a major league assistant coach on manager Gabe Kapler's staff.
In the past, she's worked on outfield and base-running instruction, and in January of 2020, she became the first woman to hold a full-time coaching position in MLB.
I'm so excited to be in this role for the challenge and the opportunity to make an impact for this organization that I love.
But also, I'm excited that now girls can see there is a job on the field in baseball.
Nakken previously coached first base during a "summer camp" exhibition game in July of 2020, but Tuesday marked the first time a woman has coached on the field in a regular-season game.

The San Francisco coach said Shildt used an expletive that ‚Äúreeked undertones of racism‚Äù.
That was plenty for Alex Cobb (1-0), who struck out 10 to win his San Francisco debut.
Yunior Marte made his major league debut pitching the ninth for San Francisco.

     Giants‚Äô Alyssa Nakken becomes the first woman to coach on an MLB field
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Choose your plan ArrowRight Nakken, an assistant who works with Giants players on baserunning and outfield defense, became the first woman in MLB history to coach on the field after the ejection of Antoan Richardson.
Her moment arrived when Richardson was ejected for responding to what he said was a comment with ‚Äúundertones of racism‚Äù by Padres third base coach Mike Shildt.
Per Richardson, Shildt was looking into the Giants‚Äô dugout for pitcher Alex Wood.
And that‚Äôs really unfortunate that‚Äôs what happened tonight.
Last night, Antoan Richardson said Padres coach Mike Shildt yelled at him with "undertones of racism."
