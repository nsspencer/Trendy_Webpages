     Gilbert Gottfried died after a long illness. What is myotonic dystrophy type II, the rare disease that reportedly caused his death?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Iconic comedian Gilbert Gottfried died on Tuesday after what his family said was "a long illness."
His representative said Gottfried's death was caused by a heart rhythm issue called recurrent ventricular tachycardia, which resulted from myotonic dystrophy type II.
Myotonic dystrophy type II, which Gottfried reportedly had, is inherited, NIH explains.
Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images for SiriusXMMyotonic dystrophy type II affects the muscles as well as organs like the heart, eyes and pancreas, and causes prolonged muscle tensing known as myotonia.
Ventricular tachycardia is a condition where the heart beats faster — usually 100 or more beats per minute, whereas the average is 60 or 100 beats per minute.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the early ’80s, when he was a cast member on Season 6 of Saturday Night Live, Gottfried tended to speak with a deeper, more melodic voice.
Would you like some maple syrup?” No, I’d like a hotel, if I can get one.
“How do you like your maple syrup?
Do you want a big vat of maple syrup?” No, do you have any place I could sit down?
He was important, and underneath his screech exists the voice of a comic who was hilarious, brave, and generous.

     Comic Gilbert Gottfried Dies at 67
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Ron KampeasGilbert Gottfried, the comic with a grating persona whose boundary testing got him canceled more than once, has died.
Gottfried, who affected a high nasal voice for his comic appearances, was a boundary crosser, and it got him into trouble at times.
“I’ve always said tragedy and comedy are roommates,” Gottfried told Vulture in 2019.
But Gottfried’s kindness was his own: The documentary tracks Gottfried accompanying his sister, street photographer Arlene Gottfried, to chemo sessions.
In a 2014 interview with The Guardian, Gottfried, perhaps unwittingly, revealed his own gifts in explaining why he admired his sister so much.
