     Derek Carr, Raiders agree to three-year, $121.5 million contract extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nearly a month after orchestrating a blockbuster trade to reunite quarterback Derek Carr with college teammate and five-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Davante Adams, the Las Vegas Raiders have taken care of their quarterback in another big way.
Carr and the team on Wednesday agreed to a three-year contract extension worth $121.5 million, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to USA TODAY Sports.
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose financial terms of the agreement.
Carr was entering the final year of his contract and set to earn $19.77 million.
In January, the Raiders hired former New England Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who has publicly professed his support for Carr.
