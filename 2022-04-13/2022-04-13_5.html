     Manchester City Still Standing After Taking Atlético’s Best Shots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There was a full-scale brawl, dozens and dozens of players and team staff members all streaming down to a corner of the field to make their opinions known.
There was a flurry of yellow cards, and a bright, angry red.
There was Diego Simeone, conducting his orchestra, urging the stadium to bay and to howl and to snarl until the last breath.
What there was not, the only thing missing, was much actual soccer.
For the most part, though, those endless last few minutes were a study in the art of not playing soccer.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His City faced Real Madrid in the last 16 in 2020 and won comfortably enough (4–2 on aggregate), pressing Zinedine Zidane’s side into errors.
German referee Daniel Siebert had been curiously lax throughout, allowing Atlético’s gamesmanship and intimidation, but as City largely maintained its discipline, Atlético’s antics eventually backfired.
City had roughly two-thirds of the ball and, without overcommitting, did pose a consistent threat in the first half.
Atlético went direct and pressed hard and for a time, as the atmosphere swelled, City looked rattled.
It drew 3–3 on the day for a 6–4 aggregate win to set up a semifinal against Villarreal, another England-Spain showdown.

     Atletico Madrid vs. Manchester City takeaways: Simeone's dark arts backfire as Man City suffer key injuries
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City barely scraped by with a 1-0 victory on aggregate following their 0-0 draw with Atletico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano.
It was quite the difference as the first half saw City take eight shots to Atletico's one but only producing an xG of 0.61.
The second half saw Atletico dominate with 13 shots to the tune of an xG of 0.68.
Simeone's style is effective, but dangerous his playersWe all know the Atletico Madrid way.
Without him on both ends against Real Madrid, City will be susceptible to Vinicius Junior, who can give defenses trouble even at full strength.
