     California Woman Admits Faking Her Abduction, Prosecutors Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A California woman whose disappearance in 2016 prompted an intense, weekslong search has accepted a plea bargain, admitting that she made up the story she gave the authorities about being abducted, beaten and leashed to a pole in a closet, prosecutors said.
Sherri Papini, 39, of Redding, Calif., will plead guilty to one count of making false statements to F.B.I.
agents about her disappearance and one count of mail fraud based on her account of being a kidnapping victim, Phillip A. Talbert, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California, said in a statement on Tuesday.
“I am deeply ashamed of myself for my behavior and so very sorry for the pain I’ve caused my family, my friends, all the good people who needlessly suffered because of my story and those who worked so hard to try to help me,” Ms. Papini said in a statement released through her lawyer, William J. Portanova.
She added, “I will work the rest of my life to make amends for what I have done.”The court has yet to schedule a date for Ms. Papini to enter her guilty pleas, Mr. Talbert said.

     Summary: Kidnapping Hoax Plea Deal In California(Sacramento, CA) — A Redding woman who made national headlines about a story that she was kidnapped and tortured six years ago now says the whole thing was a hoax and she feels ashamed, but she faces federal criminal charges.
It’s the story of Sherri Papini, the 39-year-old mother of two claiming two masked Hispanic women kidnapped her while out jogging that included lurid details of torture, branding and chained in a bedroom.
The Redding community welcomed her back when she reappeared.
On Tuesday, Papini signed a plea agreement of lying to Federal Agents and fraud that could put her in prison for five years and a quarter-million in fines.
It turns out in reality she was staying with a former boyfriend in Costa Mesa.

     Sherri Papini to Plead Guilty In Hoax Kidnapping, Says She's 'Deeply Ashamed'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Northern California woman whom federal investigators found had faked her own 2016 kidnapping has now admitted she did it, will plead guilty, and has issued a public apology.
A 34-year-old mother of two from the Redding area, Sherri Papini, disappeared while out jogging, and then mysteriously turned up several weeks later, showing bruises and an apparent branding mark, telling a story about being taken by two Hispanic women and held hostage.
Then the media started digging into Papini's past, and found she'd had a checkered adolescence that involved some contact with law enforcement.
"Instead of retracting her kidnapping story, Papini continued to make false statements about her purported abductors."

     Summary: Sherri Papini, the Northern California woman accused of faking her own kidnapping in 2016, has signed a plea deal and will confess she made up the entire plan, her attorney’s office confirmed to CNN.
As CNN previously reported, Papini was reported missing by her husband in November 2016 after she had gone out for a jog near her home in Shasta County.
Three weeks later, on Thanksgiving Day, she was found alone on an interstate highway 140 miles from home.
She told police she had been abducted and branded by two women who kept her chained in a closet.
“We are taking this case in an entirely new direction,” Portanova, a former federal prosecutor, told The Sacramento Bee.

     Summary: A Northern California woman's disappearance more than five years ago shocked the tight-knit community of Redding, California.
Neighbors volunteered for grid searches and law enforcement made finding Papini a top priority.
"We used to walk and my husband and I said, 'I'm not going to go walk by myself anymore,'" Redding resident Maria Flores said.
Private investigator Bill Garcia was so concerned about Papini, he volunteered his services to her family.
That's money that could have gone into other missing women investigations.

     The Mom Who Claimed She Was Held Captive And Beaten Has Admitted She Made It Up After Investigators Spent Years Seeking Answers

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The California mom who claimed she was kidnapped, then beaten and branded as she was held captive for three weeks, has admitted that she made up the whole story and will plead guilty to federal charges.
Sherri Papini, 39, was arrested and charged with lying to federal authorities and mail fraud earlier this year and had for years maintained that she was the victim of a brutal and puzzling crime.
As part of a plea agreement announced Tuesday, she will plead guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of making false statements.
Papini was facing 34 counts of mail fraud and one count of making false statements to authorities.
Many of the mail fraud charges were related to payments Papini made to a therapist that was treating her for "anxiety and PTSD from her purported 'kidnapping,'" according to the indictment.

     Summary: But in reality, Papini was never kidnapped, according to the Justice Department.
Portanova told the Bee on Tuesday that her legal team was “taking this case in an entirely new direction.”“Everything that has happened before today stops today,” he said.
Papini will pay more than $300,000 in restitution to local, state and federal agencies, according to the plea agreement.
A court date has yet to be scheduled for Papini to enter her guilty pleas, but Portanova told the Associated Press that she will probably enter them next week.
The man later told authorities that he helped Papini “run away” when she claimed her husband was abusing her, according to court documents.
