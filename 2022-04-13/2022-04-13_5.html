     Hawks vs. Hornets score: Atlanta advances to face Cleveland for No. 8 seed after dominant win over Charlotte
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Atlanta Hawks are one step closer to securing a berth in the 2022 NBA Playoffs after dominating the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday night at State Farm Arena by a score of 132-103.
The Hawks were ahead for, essentially, the entire evening before really opening the game up during the third quarter and creating a deficit that the Hornets just couldn't come close to overcoming.
While Trae Young led the charge on the offensive end for the Hawks with 24 points and 10 assists, Atlanta received contributions from up and down their roster as six players, in total, scored in double figures in the win.
LaMelo Ball finished with a team-high 24 points for the Hornets but, in a rather inefficient manner, it took him 25 shot attempts to get there.
Now, we will see which team can come out on top on Friday night when the Hawks and Cavaliers meet for the right to face the Miami Heat.
