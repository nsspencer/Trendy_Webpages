     Atlético win appeal to keep Wanda Metropolitano full for Man City UCL second leg tonight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 13 – Atlético Madrid will play their second leg Champions League quarter final against Manchester City tonight in front of a full Wanda Metropolitano stadium.
Knutsen loses appealFK Bodø/Glimt head coach, Kjetil Knutsen, has lost his appeal against his suspension from the next UEFA club competition matches.
Knutsen was provisionally suspended by UEFA along with Roma goalkeeper coach Nuno Santos following an altercation between the pair following last week’s European Conference league match.
Bodø/Glimt claimed they had video evidence of Roma’s support staff, including Santos, attacking Knutsen.
The second leg of the tie will be played in Rome on Thursday (April 14).

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It may not have been the most thrilling of first legs but Manchester City claimed control of their Champions League quarter final with a 1-0 win at the Etihad Stadium last week.
The question going into this game is whether Atletico Madrid can offer the attacking thrust on home soil needed to test Ederson.
Might the Champions League have one more upset left in these quarter finals?
Coming up against the best opponents [on Sunday] and then facing a tough test on Wednesday against Atletico Madrid where it is a little bit more tactical.
Expect Atletico to open up in pursuit of the goal they need... and to pay the price for doing so.

     Man City suffers through Atletico Madrid to make UCL semifinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His City faced Real Madrid in the last 16 in 2020 and won comfortably enough (4–2 on aggregate), pressing Zinedine Zidane’s side into errors.
German referee Daniel Siebert had been curiously lax throughout, allowing Atlético’s gamesmanship and intimidation, but as City largely maintained its discipline, Atlético’s antics eventually backfired.
City had roughly two-thirds of the ball and, without overcommitting, did pose a consistent threat in the first half.
Atlético went direct and pressed hard and for a time, as the atmosphere swelled, City looked rattled.
It drew 3–3 on the day for a 6–4 aggregate win to set up a semifinal against Villarreal, another England-Spain showdown.

     Summary: Steve Nicol feels Atletico Madrid should have played more attacking football sooner in their Champions League clash vs. Manchester City.
(1:41)Manchester City secured their place in the Champions League semifinals for the second consecutive season after a fiery goalless draw with Atletico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano on Wednesday saw them progress 1-0 on aggregate.
City, who still had to withstand some intense Atletico pressure in the second half, will now take on Real Madrid in the last four as they look to make it back to the final.
Manchester City players celebrate after their Champions League quarterfinal victory over Atletico Madrid.
But it was only in the second half that they began to seriously threaten the City goal.

     Man City see off Atletico in fiery clash to reach semi-finals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The trouble began on the pitch, as Atletico defender Felipe sparked a huge brawl in the corner after a taking a wild swipe at City's Phil Foden.
But City survived the early, physical onslaught and established control, even if Atletico looked a threat on the break, failing only with their final pass.
De Paul's first touch was to fire just past the post and City were retreating now, camped in their own half, accepting or unable to prevent the Atletico pressure.
A swarm of players, substitutes and staff rushed in and it was only a few minutes later that Felipe was sent off.
With nine minutes of added time, Gundogan should have settled it for City but Atleti survived.
