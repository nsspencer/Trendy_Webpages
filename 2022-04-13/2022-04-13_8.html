     Videos Show Police Officer Fatally Shooting Black Man in Michigan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The investigation into the officer’s actions was ongoing, officials said on Wednesday, and no charging decision had been made.
Chief Eric Winstrom of the Grand Rapids police said he was not aware of any weapons other than the officer’s gun and Taser being found at the scene.
Police body camera video shows the officer telling Mr. Lyoya that he is pulling him over because his license plates do not match his car.
Police killings of Black men have dominated national discussions about law enforcement in recent years, particularly after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020 touched off protests across the country, including in Grand Rapids.
In Grand Rapids, officials said that the police officer who fired the fatal shot joined the department in 2015.
