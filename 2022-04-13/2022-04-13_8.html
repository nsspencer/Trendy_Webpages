     Cuba Gooding Jr. Pleads Guilty to Forcible Touching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The actor Cuba Gooding Jr., who had been accused by more than 20 women of groping or forcibly kissing them in encounters that dated back more than two decades, pleaded guilty in Manhattan on Wednesday to one count of forcible touching.
The count, a misdemeanor, charged that he had forcibly kissed a woman at a nightclub in Manhattan in 2018.
Under terms of the plea, Mr. Gooding must continue for six more months in alcohol and behavior modification treatment that he has been undergoing since 2019, and he must have no new arrests, the Manhattan district attorneyâ€™s office said.
If he fulfills the terms of the plea, he can then withdraw the plea and plead to a lesser charge of harassment, a violation, with a sentence of time served, the office said.
Also, the record of the plea will not be sealed, the office said.

     Cuba Gooding Jr. pleads guilty to sex charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The actor pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in New York.
Actor Cuba Gooding Jr. pleaded guilty Wednesday to resolve his forcible touching and sex assault case in Manhattan, where prosecutors accused the actor of groping three different women.
Until now, Gooding had denied the charges, all misdemeanors, and the defense contended Gooding was unfairly tarnished in the fervor of the #MeToo era.
Gooding pleaded guilty to forcible touching, a class A misdemeanor, the top count he faced and also admitted to two other incidents of non-consensual contact in October 2018 and June 2019.
Prosecutors had wanted to call two additional women to testify about their encounters with Gooding even though their accounts did not form the basis of the criminal charges.
