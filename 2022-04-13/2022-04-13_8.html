     Summary: Kidnapping Hoax Plea Deal In California(Sacramento, CA) — A Redding woman who made national headlines about a story that she was kidnapped and tortured six years ago now says the whole thing was a hoax and she feels ashamed, but she faces federal criminal charges.
It’s the story of Sherri Papini, the 39-year-old mother of two claiming two masked Hispanic women kidnapped her while out jogging that included lurid details of torture, branding and chained in a bedroom.
The Redding community welcomed her back when she reappeared.
On Tuesday, Papini signed a plea agreement of lying to Federal Agents and fraud that could put her in prison for five years and a quarter-million in fines.
It turns out in reality she was staying with a former boyfriend in Costa Mesa.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But in reality, Papini was never kidnapped, according to the Justice Department.
Portanova told the Bee on Tuesday that her legal team was “taking this case in an entirely new direction.”“Everything that has happened before today stops today,” he said.
Papini will pay more than $300,000 in restitution to local, state and federal agencies, according to the plea agreement.
A court date has yet to be scheduled for Papini to enter her guilty pleas, but Portanova told the Associated Press that she will probably enter them next week.
The man later told authorities that he helped Papini “run away” when she claimed her husband was abusing her, according to court documents.
