     Giants' Alyssa Nakken becomes first woman to coach on field in regular-season MLB game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She now serves as a major league assistant coach on manager Gabe Kapler's staff.
In the past, she's worked on outfield and base-running instruction, and in January of 2020, she became the first woman to hold a full-time coaching position in MLB.
I'm so excited to be in this role for the challenge and the opportunity to make an impact for this organization that I love.
But also, I'm excited that now girls can see there is a job on the field in baseball.
Nakken previously coached first base during a "summer camp" exhibition game in July of 2020, but Tuesday marked the first time a woman has coached on the field in a regular-season game.

     Summary: While San Francisco Giants fans may have enjoyed their team's 13-2 home victory over the San Diego Padres Tuesday night, a different type of win came when Giants assistant coach Alyssa Nakken took over as first base coach, becoming the first woman to coach on the field in major league baseball history.
It became another milestone for the coach who was already the league's first full-time female coach.
Nakken became an assistant coach in 2020 after working in the team's front office.
But for the Giants' assistant coach, Tuesday night was just another day at the office.

     Summary: Choose your plan ArrowRight Nakken, an assistant who works with Giants players on baserunning and outfield defense, became the first woman in MLB history to coach on the field after the ejection of Antoan Richardson.
Her moment arrived when Richardson was ejected for responding to what he said was a comment with ‚Äúundertones of racism‚Äù by Padres third base coach Mike Shildt.
Per Richardson, Shildt was looking into the Giants‚Äô dugout for pitcher Alex Wood.
And that‚Äôs really unfortunate that‚Äôs what happened tonight.
Last night, Antoan Richardson said Padres coach Mike Shildt yelled at him with "undertones of racism."
