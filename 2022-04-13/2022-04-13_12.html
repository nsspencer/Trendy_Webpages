     Zion Williamson Wouldn’t Be Ready For First-Round Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pelicans won’t have Zion Williamson available if they advance to Friday’s play-in game or even a first-round series against the Suns, the team told Cassidy Hubbarth of ESPN (hat tip to Real GM).
Williamson hasn’t been ruled out for the season, but a Pelicans spokesperson informed Hubbarth that “a return to play is not imminent.”Williamson, who hasn’t played since having offseason surgery on a fracture in his right foot, raised some eyebrows with a 360 dunk during warm-ups before tonight’s game (video link).
Although he looked as explosive as ever, the Pelicans don’t believe he’s ready for game action.
1 pick in the 2019 draft has advanced to the point in rehab where he can participate in controlled scrimmages with teammates and assistant coaches.
There has been hope among Pelicans fans that he could return to boost the team’s playoff chances, but tonight’s report makes that seem unlikely unless New Orleans can somehow win a series or two.

     2 Trade Packages To Send Zion Williamson To New York Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zion Williamson to the New York Knicks has always felt preordained since before he stepped foot on an NBA court.
When the lottery order was announced in 2019, Knicks fans nearly rioted.
Unlike Williamson, he’s at least been able to stay there.
A slew of injuries has left Zion on the injury report more often than he’s been in the starting lineup.
If a formal trade demand comes, the Pelicans may be forced to oblige it.

     Zion Williamson throws down 360 windmill before Pelicans' Play-In game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zion Williamson’s recovery from a right foot injury has improved to the point where he’s been participating in controlled scrimmages with assistant coaches and players.
Williamson has not appeared in game this season and was ruled out for the Pelicans’ Play-In game against the Spurs, though he stole the show during warmups.
1 pick looked as explosive as ever while throwing down a pair of windmill dunks, including a vicious 360.
Video of Williamson’ workout quickly became a hot topic on Twitter, as well as ESPN’s halftime show during the Hawks-Hornets Play-In game.
Williamson broke the fifth metacarpal in his right foot during a preseason workout last summer.

     Summary: The Impending Divorce Of The Still Excellent Jazz by John Wilmes Utah's division of labor has worked pretty well on paper, but the human toll is increasingly seen, and the basketball ecosystem in Salt Lake City appears to be crumbling despite still functioning at a very high level.
The Sheer Lovability Of Jose Alvarado by John Wilmes Jose Alvarado's measurable impact on the floor may be only marginally positive for the Pelicans, but his presence signifies something more important, which is that good, unexpected basketball things can actually happen in New Orleans.

     Summary: In spite of the promising showing and potential that the New Orleans Pelicans can achieve for contention, franchise star Zion Williamson will remain inactive in his team’s Friday Play-In showdown against the Los Angeles Clippers and even if it manages to march into the first round of the playoffs.
While Williamson hasn’t been declared unavailable for the remainder of the season, a Pelicans staff told ESPN’s Cassidy Hubbarth that “a return to play is not imminent” for the one-time All-star.
Most comprehensive report on Zion Williamson all season.
@CassidyHubbarth during Pelicans/Spurs play-in game reports Zion will not play Friday (if Pels win tonight) or in potential playoff series with Suns.
Says goal for Zion is training camp (in September) and Zion understands.

     Stephen A. Smith on Zion Williamson's 360 slam: 'It makes me want to throw up'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Credit: USA TODAY Sports-ScanpixNBA analyst for ESPN, Stephen A. Smith, reacted to Zion Williamson throwing down a 360-windmill-dunk in the New Orleans Pelicans' pregame warmup ahead of their play-in matchup with the San Antonio Spurs.
How does that help the NBA brand to see a guy in a warm-up that you have not seen the entire damn year?
Earlier this campaign, Shams Charania of The Athletic reported that Zion Williamson is not expected to return to play this season.
The 21-year-old returned to New Orleans after rehabbing his fractured foot injury in Portland.
Williamson underwent surgery to repair his broken foot last summer and had several return targets delayed this season.
