     Pelicans vs. Spurs play-in is a sell out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Both the Pelicans and San Antonio Spurs opened the 2021-2022 campaign with dreadful starts, making this play-in appearance all the more incredible for both sides.
Both the Spurs and Pelicans opened the season dreadfully.
The Spurs started 4-13 in their first 17 games, while the Pelicans began the season with an equally ignominious 3-14 start through their first 17.
The two division rivals have met four prior times this season, with the Spurs winning three times, including both matchups in New Orleans.
The Clippers lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday night in the "7 vs. 8" leg of the play-in tournament.

Veterans of the Game Thread know how we do things around here, but for all you newbies we have a few rules.
The Spurs have had pretty good success this season against the Pelicans, winning 3 out of the 4 matchups, including both games in New Orleans.
Jaxson Hayes gives the Pelicans a lot of size in their frontcourt, so Pop might counter with Jock Landale as necessary.

     Pelicans' Keys to Defeat the Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The regular-season series with the Spurs wasn't too kind for the Pelicans as San Antonio took 3 of 4 games against the Pelicans, including 2 in New Orleans.
In the 107-103 Spurs victory last month, the Spurs had 16 offensive rebounds, leading to 22 second-chance points for San Antonio.
3 &amp; DThe Pelicans' bigs and guards make the team rebounding paramount to finishing off defensive possessions or extending offensive possessions for themselves.
The Spurs are not great 3-point shooting team themselves by any stretch, but they have had some success against the Pelicans this year.
The Pelicans are only shooting 30% from 3-point corners versus the Spurs this season, which would rank 21st in the league.

     Summary: New Orleans Pelicans: 3 keys to beating the Spurs in the Play-in by George HathawayThe Pelicans will take on the San Antonio Spurs in what will hopefully be the first game of the NBA play-in tournament for New Orleans.
If the Pels win, they will go on to face the Los Angeles Clippers, who lost to the Timberwolves.
He has logged two triple-doubles against the Pelicans this season and had 31 points and 12 assists in a Spurs’ win back in February.

     Pelicans vs. Spurs score, takeaways: CJ McCollum, Brandon Ingram lead New Orleans to showdown with Clippers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CJ McCollum finished the win with a game-high 32 points, seven assists and six rebounds while Brandon Ingram and Jonas Valanciunas both eclipsed the 20-point plateau to lead the charge on the offensive end for New Orleans.
With the win, New Orleans advances to face the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night in an elimination game for the right to be the No.
Pelicans bucket-gettersThe playoffs often come down to individual shot-making, and the Pelicans have two of the best in the biz with CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram.
On Wednesday, Ingram did a lot of his damage heading toward the rim and getting to the foul line early, then McCollum went to work, displaying a seemingly unending array of step-backs and stutter steps.
After the loss, Popovich was asked whether he'd return for his 27th season, and he answered in true Pop fashion.
