     Roberto Firmino Becomes 4th Liverpool Player To Score 20+ UCL Goals As Reds Reach Semi-Finals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Roberto Firmino Becomes 4th Liverpool Player To Score 20+ UCL Goals As Reds Reach Semi-FinalsRoberto Firmino proved yet again that he is a man who delivers on European nights.
The Brazilian is generally known more for being a team player, rather than a prolific scorer himself.
But he improved his already excellent Champions League goals record as Liverpool booked their place in the semi-finals.
That was his 20th Champions League goal.
The Portuguese side contributed to a Champions League classic with some excellent attacking play of their own.

     Liverpool in Champions League semis, quadruple dreams alive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APLIVERPOOL, England (AP) — A place in the Champions League semifinals secured.
Liverpool is in a good place entering the home straight of what could turn out to be the club’s greatest ever season.
Even conceding two late goals to draw 3-3 at home to Benfica couldn’t take the smile of Jurgen Klopp’s face.
Roberto Firmino's second-half double put Liverpool 3-1 ahead on the night and 6-2 ahead on aggregate, only for Klopp's team to ease off the pace.
The Brazilian volleyed in Tsimikas’ free kick to make it 3-1 but Liverpool let Benfica back into the match.

     Summary: Roberto Firmino celebrates after scoring a goal against Benfica in the Champions League.
PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty ImagesRoberto Firmino scored twice as Liverpool drew 3-3 with a gutsy Benfica on Wednesday to advance to the Champions League semifinals 6-4 on aggregate.
Benfica pulled one back just after the half-hour mark through Goncalo Ramos and the teams went into the break tied at 1-1 with Liverpool leading 4-2 on aggregate.
Benfica admirably stuck at the task and pulled two goals back in the latter stages to return a minor degree of tension to Anfield.
As we advanced the opponents became more difficult, but we gave a good account of ourselves," said Benfica manager Nelson Verissimo.

     Benfica shows Jürgen Klopp finally has Liverpool trait that he has never had and will not repeat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the previous night's Champions League results, there was something ominously nonchalant about Jürgen Klopp's decision to make a whopping seven changes in Liverpool's quarter-final second leg against Benfica.
After all, two-goal leads, as the common adage goes, are one of most fragile leads in the world of football.
One that Benfica capitalised on, making Liverpool sweat until the last minute of the game.
Benfica might object to the term 'cruise', but ultimately they never ate into the two-goal advantage that existed at kick-off.
With this squad, Liverpool are invincible.

     Liverpool to face Villarreal in semi-final after thrilling draw with Benfica
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Benfica salvaged pride at Anfield whereas Liverpool preserved dreams of a seventh European crown and unprecedented quadruple.
Benfica fought back from 3-1 down on the night courtesy of two late goals that were disallowed for offside before being awarded by VAR.
On the two previous occasions Liverpool defeated Benfica in the quarter-finals – 1978 and 1984 – they went on to lift the trophy.
With Mohamed Salah rested on the bench for the first time in a Champions League game this season Klopp tasked Luis Díaz with troubling Benfica from the right.
Benfica substitute Roman Yaremchuk was flagged offside after receiving Julian Weigl’s pass, rounding Alisson and rolling into an unguarded net.

     Summary: Jurgen Klopp admitted he was relieved to see Liverpool book a Champions League semi-final showdown against Villarreal as the quadruple chasers survived a late collapse in Wednesday's 3-3 draw against Benfica.
"When I'm not over the moon about qualifying for the Champions League semi-final, something is really wrong and maybe I should quit!"
The Reds will face Spanish side Villarreal in the semi-finals as they look to reach their 10th Champions League final and claim a seventh title in the competition.
"To beat Juventus and Bayern Munich, they deserve to be in the Champions League semi-finals.
