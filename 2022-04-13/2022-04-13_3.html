     Summary: On an entertaining night of Champions League action, Liverpool drew 3-3 against a resolute Benfica after two goals from Roberto Firmino and one from Ibrahima Konate.
Goncalo Ramos, Roman Yaremchuk and Darwin Nunez scored to put the visitors level on the night, but they could not overcome the 6-4 aggregate deficit.
Jurgen Klopp's side will now face Unai Emery's Villarreal in the semi-finals, with the first leg kicking off on April 27 at Anfield.
The game between Manchester City and Atletico Madrid ended goalless in Spain, but was a feisty affair which saw Felipe sent off late on.
Pep Guardiola's team progress 1-0 on aggregate and are set to face Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid in the last four in two weeks' time at the Etihad Stadium.

     Liverpool ousts Benfica, through to Champions League semis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APLIVERPOOL, England (AP) — Liverpool didn’t need its best players to secure progress to the Champions League semifinals on Wednesday.
Liverpool stayed on course to win the competition for a seventh time, and for an unprecedented quadruple of trophies this season.
The Brazil striker volleyed in Tsimikas' free kick to make it 3-1 but Liverpool eased off, and Benfica took advantage by breaking the offside trap for both of its late goals.
Playing Benfica and Villarreal, the two outsiders in the quarterfinal draw, to reach the final is pretty much a dream scenario for Liverpool, though captain Jordan Henderson was taking nothing for granted.
“It was pretty comfortable,” he said about Liverpool's display against Benfica, “but we’re disappointed with the goals we conceded.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp opted to rest stars like Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold, and saw his back-ups play out a wild 3-3 draw with Benfica in the second leg of the quarter-finals to wrap up a 6-4 aggregate win.
Villarreal await Liverpool in the last four.
“It was not exactly what we wanted but it is absolutely not important,” said Klopp.

     Summary: Benfica salvaged pride at Anfield but Liverpool preserved their dreams of a seventh European crown and unprecedented quadruple.
Jürgen Klopp’s side advanced into the Champions League semi-finals, where they will meet Villarreal, on a fluctuating night when VAR had a hand in all three Benfica goals and Liverpool were made to fight to the finish.
Ibrahima Konaté and a brace from Roberto Firmino put Liverpool on a comfortable course for the last four before VAR intervened in the form of two late Benfica goals.
On the two previous occasions Liverpool defeated Benfica in the quarter-finals – in 1978 and 1984 – they went on to lift the trophy.
The Liverpool striker scuffed his shot across goal but Firmino was on hand to convert into an empty net.

He is usually one of the best players on the pitch but had arguably his worst game for the club against Manchester City on Sunday.
On such a big pitch at Wembley, there needs to be a slight alteration in how the Reds deal with this tactual double-up on the wing-backs.
How many more pieces of silverware do you think Liverpool end up with this season?
Salah’s representatives have tried their best to get the best deal possible for the Egyptian but Liverpool have stood their ground in negotiations and called the agent's bluff.

     Summary: Sign up to receive the best LFC opinion direct to your inboxIn a title race as tight as those involving Liverpool and Manchester City, even the smallest of advantages should be cherished.
As every supporter knows, the 2019 battle between the pair ended in 11mm of goalline deciding the destination of the Premier League trophy.
Games against Manchester United, Newcastle and Tottenham are scheduled to take place before Manchester City face Brighton, Leeds and Newcastle respectively.
Only next Sunday’s Merseyside derby sees Liverpool play after Pep Guardiola’s men, for whom a seemingly straightforward clash with Watford awaits.
Interestingly, there was no such advantage on offer with seven games to go in 2019, largely because Manchester City only moved level on fixtures late in the day courtesy of victory at Old Trafford.
