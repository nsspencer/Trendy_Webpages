     Six Outs From a Perfect Game, Kershaw’s Day Was Done
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clayton Kershaw has won three National League Cy Young Awards, one N.L.
Most Valuable Player Award and a World Series.
He has thrown a no-hitter and compiled a near-certain Hall of Fame résumé.
But he has never thrown a perfect game, and his best chance at accomplishing that exceptionally rare feat may have disappeared thanks to circumstances including a manager’s decision, his age and recent injury history and, possibly even, the owner-imposed lockout that threw Major League Baseball into uncertainty this winter.
Dodgers 7, Twins 0 | Box Score | Play-by-PlayKershaw, 34, was absolutely dominant in his first start of the season, striking out 13 Minnesota Twins over seven innings and 80 pitches on a cold, 38-degree day at Target Field in Minneapolis.

     Dodgers 7, Twins 0: Absolutely Imperfect Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He was up against less than ideal circumstances between just being traded, facing a deadly Dodgers lineup, and dealing with cold weather, and he did alright.
He’s the greatest pitcher of his generation and has accomplished everything he possibly could- besides a perfect game.
I won’t listen to any defense of the decision to yank him and deprive him of trying (the way he was dominating, succeeding) for the 24th perfect game in MLB history.
Alex Vesia entered for the Dodgers, and gave up the Twins’ only two baserunners, a single by Gary Sanchez and a walk of Max Kepler.
In the bottom of the 9th, the Twins went down without a whimper, and mercifully brought an end to this two-game series.

     Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw pulled after throwing 7 perfect innings: 'It was the right decision'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dodgers left-hander Clayton Kershaw pitched seven perfect innings at Minnesota on Wednesday before exiting in eighth inning.
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts pulled the 34-year-old before the bottom of the eighth inning with Kershaw at 80 pitches.
In that game, Kershaw struck out 15 batters, but his bid for a perfect game was busted when Colorado's Corey Dickerson reached first base on a throwing error by Hanley Ramirez in the seventh inning.
Dodgers teammates Cody Bellinger, Gavin Lux and Austin Barnes hit consecutive home runs in the eighth inning off Twins reliever Dereck Rodríguez, as Kershaw looked on with a smile.
Now in his 15th season, Kershaw is on a one-year, $17 million contract with the Dodgers.

     Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw removed from perfect game bid after seven spotless innings in season debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Dodgers southpaw Clayton Kershaw was removed from a perfect game bid on Wednesday afternoon against the Minnesota Twins.
Vesia subsequently surrendered a single to Gary Sánchez, dashing any hopes Los Angeles had of making history.
"As much as I would have wanted to do it, I've thrown 75 pitches in a sim game," Kershaw told reporters.
The only perfect game in Dodgers history was thrown by Sandy Koufax in September 1965.
Major League Baseball's most recent perfect game occurred when former Seattle Mariners ace Félix Hernández hurled one on August 15, 2012 against the Tampa Bay Rays.

     Summary: Clayton Kershaw goes perfect through seven innings on 80 pitches for the Dodgers.
(0:30)MINNEAPOLIS -- Clayton Kershaw was in prime form -- call it perfect -- in his season debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers, leaving no concern about his health after facing no resistance from the Minnesota Twins.
Kershaw took a perfect game through seven innings for the Dodgers until he was pulled after 80 pitches, dominating the Twins with 13 strikeouts in 21 batters during a 7-0 victory on Wednesday.
Cody Bellinger, Gavin Lux and Austin Barnes hit back-to-back-to-back home runs in the eighth against reliever Dereck Rodriguez, who made his Twins debut.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the Dodgers’ 7-0 win over the Minnesota Twins, Kershaw pitched seven perfect innings before being removed by manager Dave Roberts with the pitch count at 80 in his first outing after a lockout-shortened spring training.
Clayton Kershaw heads back to the Dodgers dugout with a smile on his face after pitching seven perfect innings.
According to Roberts, Kershaw said he could go at least another inning, feeling comfortable to throw 80-85.
And to see a battery of him and Austin throw a perfect game or a no-hitter, I’m all in.
“It was time.”Kershaw’s one regret was not giving Barnes, his longtime friend and battery mate, the chance to catch a perfect game.
