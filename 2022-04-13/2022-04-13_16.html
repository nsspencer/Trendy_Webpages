     Blue Sky Studios Gives Scrat a Proper Sendoff in Final Farewell
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has somehow been 20 years since audiences first witnessed the adventures of Manny, Sid, Diego, and all the rest of the Ice Age crew.
Blue Sky Studios is the team behind Ice Age, but it has gone extinct thanks to the recent megamerger of Disney and 20th Century Fox.
As a brief goodbye from the artists that brought this franchise to life, Blue Sky posted a brief animation of the popular squirrel finally securing the acorn and eating it.
The description of the video is far from the tone of Blue Sky’s films, reading as a final message that wouldn’t otherwise get out.
“In the final days of Blue Sky Studios, a small team of artists came together to do one final shot.

     Summary: Following their closure by Disney, the staff at Blue Sky Studios have snuck out one final piece of work, one year later.
Disney, not really needing another animation studio, simply shut Blue Sky down after a couple of decades in operation.
Just over a year since Blue Sky Studios closed its doors for the final time, and a clip has just been posted on an unnamed YouTube account.
The unlisted clip comes with a description that reads ‘In the final days of Blue Sky Studios, a small team of artists came together to do one final shot.
Here then is the final work of the Blue Sky team in its original form…—Thank you for visiting!

     Ice Age Finally Lets Scrat Have His Acorn in Heartwarming Farewell to Blue Sky Studios
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✖When Disney completed its acquisition of 20th Century Fox, it shuttered Blue Sky Studios, the company behind the beloved Ice Age franchise.
As their final act, however, some animators at Blue Sky teamed up to deliver a farewell to the studio on their terms.
With the release of Ice Age: Scrat Tales on Disney+ Wednesday morning, the final animation from Blue Sky was also unveiled.
Earlier this year, Disney+ released a new Ice Age movie, The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild, focusing on Simon Pegg's character from the sequels.
"He's an eccentric character, he's wacky, he's joyful, he's lovable.

The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild spinoff film was released on Disney+ back in January.

     Summary: Scrat finally gets the acorn in the final short from Blue Sky Studios.
Blue Sky Studios was officially closed in February 2021, while still at work on a number of projects, including the feature animation adaptation of Nimona (which has since gone to Netflix) and a series of Scrat shorts, Ice Age: Scrat Tales.
Take a look at the video below:Ice Age: Scrat Tales just debuted on Disney+, which features six all-new shorts with Scrat, produced by the Blue Sky Studio Ice Age team, including Wedge, who once again voices the wacky squirrel.
Disney+ also recently released an Ice Age spinoff film, The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild, which brings back the key characters of the Ice Age franchise, albeit with all-new voice actors (aside from Simon Pegg as Buck) and is produced by an entirely different animation studio.
