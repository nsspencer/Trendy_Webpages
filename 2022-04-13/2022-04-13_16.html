     Summary: Carr noted that it was his family and his faith that propelled him through getting the deal done with the Raiders.
"I had to have trust and have faith that this was going to get done," said Carr.
Along with the teammates Carr has already found chemistry with, the Raiders acquired his college teammate and best friend All-Pro receiver Davante Adams.
"I was on the phone with him a lot and we were trying to figure things out and see how we can do it," Carr told Raiders.com of the Adams trade.
"At that moment I found out, I think I was at my house when finally someone told me, 'It's done.'

     Raiders finally treat Derek Carr as franchise QB with new contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jay Biggerstaff/USA TODAY SportsThe counterargument to handing Carr a fistful of money ignores how much better he’s become amid the storms.
Under McDaniels, who will theoretically borrow heavily from the Patriots’ individualistic, matchup-based offense, we could see the best of what Carr has to offer.
At least that is the hope when you treat Carr like a franchise quarterback for the first time in his adult life.
So it goes for Carr, who arrives in the short-term oasis of franchise player-dom after eight long seasons.
What happens now that he has all of the resources and stability of a top-five player at the position?

     Summary: HENDERSON, Nev. -- Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr signed a multiyear contract extension Wednesday.
The Raiders did not disclose terms of the deal, but a source confirmed to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that Carr agreed to a three-year, $121.5 million extension that includes a no-trade clause and runs through the 2025 season.
He signed a five-year, $125 million extension in 2017 that was, at the time, the richest contract in NFL history.
His new money average per year of $40.5 million (for the extension only) ranks fifth among NFL quarterbacks.
"I went through a heartbreak the last time I signed my contract -- my best friend left [Khalil Mack]," he said.

     Summary: 5:12pm: Carr’s contract contains a $65.5MM injury guarantee, according to SI.com’s Albert Breer, and the deal will give the ninth-year veteran a $5.2MM raise in 2022 (Twitter link).

Carr’s deal includes a no-trade clause (Twitter link via NFL.com’s Mike Garafolo), a rarity in the NFL enjoyed by only about a dozen players.
That’s player-friendly cashflow for Carr, who was fighting for his Raiders future just a couple of years ago.
Carr, who just turned 31, had one year to go on his old deal with a cap hit of $19.8MM.
