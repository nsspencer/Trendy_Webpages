podcast, Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield was asked if he felt the team’s acquisition of Deshaun Watson was disrespectful.
Not soon after that, Mayfield requested a trade, and the day after that the team officially traded for Watson.
The team has struggled to find a trade partner and could very well keep Mayfield on the roster for next season.

     Summary: Baker Mayfield is on his way out in Cleveland, and the quarterback is starting to speak his mind about the entire situation.
After being bumped to the trade block following the Browns’ acquisition of Deshaun Watson, Mayfield stated that he’s felt disrespected throughout the whole ordeal.
[RELATED: “No Market” For Baker Mayfield]“I feel disrespected 100% because I was told one thing and they completely did another,” Mayfield said during his appearance on the “Ya Neva Know: You Know What I Mean?” podcast (via Nate Ulrich of the Akron Beacon Journal).
Things have obviously changed following the blockbuster acquisition of Watson, and while it hasn’t been explicitly stated, there’s no way the Browns enter next season with Mayfield still on the roster.
“Um … Seattle?” Mayfield said during his podcast appearance (via Bob Condotta of the Seattle Times).

     Summary: Baker Mayfield has made it clear since before the Browns' official acquisition of quarterback Deshaun Watson that his days in Cleveland are numbered.
Mayfield confirmed Wednesday that he's lost faith in the organization and is prepared for his inevitable departure, telling the "Ya Never Know" podcast that he "100 percent" feels disrespected by the Browns.
Mayfield is referring to the Browns naming him their likely 2022 starter early this offseason, then later landing Watson in a polarizing blockbuster deal with the Texans.
As for his next team, Mayfield said multiple times he has "no clue where I'm going."
"And true Clevelanders and true Browns fans know that.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baker Mayfield says he feels "disrespected" by the Cleveland Browns after they traded for Deshaun Watson last month, effectively ending Mayfield's tenure after four seasons as the team's starting quarterback.
Though Mayfield remains on the Browns' roster, the team is actively looking to trade him.
Mayfield said the shoulder injury was especially tough because of how it affected his play both physically and mentally.
"That's when I started losing my own self-confidence and losing myself.
It sucked because I knew what I could be doing, but I physically wasn't in a state to do it."

     Summary: I got my taste of it because I've had four different head coaches in four years, a bunch of different coordinators.
Mayfield didn't take kindly to the negativity.
When the Browns landed Watson in a blockbuster deal with the Houston Texans, the bridge between the team and Mayfield had already been burned.
Mayfield didn't get much stability during his time in Cleveland, playing for four different head coaches and offensive coordinators in four seasons.
"This would've been a week-and-a-half ago, I would've said Indianapolis," Mayfield said, adding Seattle is "probably the most likely option."
