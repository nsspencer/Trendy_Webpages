     D-Backs walk off Astros 3-2 in 10 innings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On a game that went wrong in many aspects for the Astros on Wednesday afternoon, they lost it 3-2 to the Arizona Diamondbacks.
A sac fly by Ketel Marté walked them off the field in the bottom of the 10th inning to split the two-game series in the desert.
The Astros figured it out to keep things close despite the pitching disaster, but they couldn’t hit.
One early run in the second inning put the D-Backs ahead in the score until the seventh when Houston scored on a sac fly by Martín Maldonado.
Then, in the 10th inning, the Astros scored for the second time via Alex Bregman’s sacrifice fly.

     Brantley's clutch hit in 9th lifts Astros over D-backs 2-1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ryan Pressly handled the bottom of the ninth for his third save, working around a leadoff single by Seth Beer.
But that was the only big hit for Arizona's struggling offense, which is batting just .130 through five games.
Ellis had one hit in eight at-bats and struck out four times in the season-opening series against the Padres.
UP NEXTThe Astros and Diamondbacks wrap up their two-game series with a day game Wednesday.
The Diamondbacks will send RHP Merrill Kelly (0-0, 0.00 ERA) to the mound to face LHP Framber Valdez (1-0, 0.00).

     Astros insider: Ryan Pressly getting results, albeit with velocity down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX — Last month, Ryan Pressly attributed a decline in velocity to a lack of adrenaline.
After four outings with far more ample adrenaline, Pressly is still not showing the velocity to which the Astros are accustomed.
Pressly threw him two fastballs to start the plate appearance.
He averaged 95.4 mph last season and regularly touched 97 mph.
Logic suggests the Astros would not have committed two more years and $30 million to Pressly if they knew of any health concerns.

     Ketel Marte sacrifice fly in 10th boosts Diamondbacks past Astros
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It might just be the sixth game of the season but Arizona Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo says he's already "exhausted."
It managed just six hits, two more than it accounted for in Tuesday night's 2-1 loss to the same foe.
The Diamondbacks were the recipient of nine walks and three hit batters yet struggled to score, going just 1-for-13 with runners in scoring position.
"That was a grinding game," Lovullo said.
But it was a good win.

     Marte, Beer help D-backs rally past Astros 3-2 in 10 innings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Beer tied the game in the 10th inning with an RBI single, and Ketel Marte followed with a game-ending sacrifice fly to give the Diamondbacks a 3-2 win over the Houston Astros.
The game was full of missed opportunities for both teams — tied at 1-all through nine innings — until each scratched across runs in the 10th.
Beer’s sharp single through the drawn-in infield got past Houston second baseman Jose Altuve to tie the game at 2-all.
Plate umpire Jim Reynolds didn’t see the ball hit Marte but a D-backs challenge confirmed the ball glanced off Marte’s foot.
The Astros tied the game in the seventh when Martin Maldonado’s sacrifice fly brought home McCormick.
