     Zion Williamson Dunk Video Going Viral: NBA World Reacts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pelicans star Zion Williamson seems to making some solid strides in his injury recovery.
Ahead of tonight’s Play-In matchup against the San Antonio Spurs, the former No.
Take a look at the dunk here:Zion with the 360 dunk during his pregame workout.
Many are frustrated by Williamson’s seeming unwillingness to take the court despite being healthy enough to pull off this eye-popping pregame dunk.
Even if the Pelicans are able to progress in this year’s Play-In tournament, it’s unlikely Zion will return at any point this postseason.

     Summary: Zion Williamson’s recovery from a right foot injury has improved to the point where he’s been participating in controlled scrimmages with assistant coaches and players.
Williamson has not appeared in game this season and he’s been ruled out for the Pelicans’ Play-In game against the Spurs, though he stole the show during warmups.
Zion casually ripping down a 360 🆙 pic.twitter.com/JnhoU0bdjZ — NBA (@NBA) April 14, 2022The dunk was immediately a hot topic on Twitter, as well as ESPN’s halftime show during the Hawks-Hornets Play-In game.
Assuming the Pelicans advance to the playoffs, there’s no expectation he’ll take the floor — but he hasn’t been ruled out just yet.
Williamson broke the fifth metacarpal in his right foot during a preseason workout last summer.

     2 Trade Packages To Send Zion Williamson To New York Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zion Williamson to the New York Knicks has always felt preordained since before he stepped foot on an NBA court.
When the lottery order was announced in 2019, Knicks fans nearly rioted.
Unlike Williamson, he’s at least been able to stay there.
A slew of injuries has left Zion on the injury report more often than he’s been in the starting lineup.
If a formal trade demand comes, the Pelicans may be forced to oblige it.
