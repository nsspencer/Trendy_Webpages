     Summary: We’re talking about 98 Degrees fave Nick Lachey and TRL host Vanessa Minnillo—now known, of course, as Vanessa Lachey.
Nick was fresh off his divorce from Jessica “chicken-of-the-sea” Simpson when he started dating Vanessa, leading to a lot of public pressure for the couple.
Seventeen years and three kids later, Nick and Vanessa are happily married, seemingly on friendly terms with Jessica.
(Though she didn’t admit to infidelity at the time, Jessica later wrote in her 2020 memoir Open Book that she had an emotional affair with Jackass star Johnny Knoxville.)

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vanessa Lachey has revealed that she and her husband Nick only realized they wanted to get married after they broke up and dated other people.
Vanessa admitted she and Nick broke up before eventually deciding they wanted to get married, saying it took them dating other people to realize their commitment to each other.
Nick and Vanessa met when they co-starred in his 2006 music video What's Left Of Me, shortly after his split from Jessica Simpson.
The 41-year-old admitted that she and Nick, 48, decided to break up after five years of dating after she said she wanted to get married.
Elsewhere on the reality TV show, Vanessa shared her thoughts on how her husband Nick's much-publicized marriage and divorce from Jessica impacted their early relationship.
