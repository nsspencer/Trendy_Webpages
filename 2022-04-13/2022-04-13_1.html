Montrezl Harrell shared a clip (which was posted by Bleacher Report on Twitter) of the team having to walk to State Farm Arena before they played the Atlanta Hawks.

     Miles Bridges ejected from Charlotte Hornets-Atlanta Hawks play-in game, hits fan with mouthpiece while exiting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Miles Bridges offers up an apology for his reaction to being ejected from the game against the Hawks.
(0:48)Charlotte Hornets forward Miles Bridges struck a young fan with his mouthpiece after he was ejected from the team's 132-103 play-in loss to the host Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night, later calling his actions as he exited the court "unacceptable."
"I was aiming for the guy that was screaming at me and it hit a little girl," Bridges said.
"So that's definitely unacceptable on my part and I take full responsibility.

     Hornets' arrival to State Farm Arena blocked by freight train
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ATLANTA (AP) — The Charlotte Hornets were delayed getting to the arena Wednesday for their NBA Play-In game against the Atlanta Hawks.
By a freight train, of all things.
Tracks run all around State Farm Arena, a remnant of a time when the area was the site of the city’s two major passenger stations.
Both stations were torn down decades ago, but many of the tracks that remain are still frequented by freight trains running near the heart of downtown Atlanta.
“I’ve been coming to this arena for 20 years, and I’ve never seen a train stop before the game.”He seemed to imply that the Hawks had something to do with the freight train stopping at the crossing.

     Trae Young gets the best of the Hornets and LaMelo Ball as Hawks end Charlotte’s season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young (11) drives to the basket past Charlotte Hornets forward P.J.
Doomed by ineffectiveness on both sides of the ball, the 10th-seeded Hornets were run out of the building by ninth-seeded Atlanta 132-103 in their play-in tournament matchup.
It was a worse result than a year ago when the Hornets lost by 27 in Indiana.
Atlanta received too many open looks and the Hornets were constantly scrambling to chase down 3-point shooters, a common sight throughout the season.
“It’s the same defense we played when Trae scored nine points and we won the game in Charlotte,” Borrego said.

     Summary: Trae Young is defense-proofTrae Young shot 3-of-13 from the field in the first half.
They had 60 in the first half precisely because of all of the extra attention Charlotte gave to Young.
If the Hawks can give Young the right teammates, there's no reason they shouldn't be able to score like this for years to come.
LaMelo LaBustsA year ago, LaMelo Ball shot 4-of-14 in a blowout play-in loss to the Pacers.
When the Hornets stayed at home on those shooters in the second half, the Hawks got all of the layups and dunks they wanted.
