     Hornets' arrival to State Farm Arena blocked by freight train
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ATLANTA (AP) — The Charlotte Hornets were delayed getting to the arena Wednesday for their NBA Play-In game against the Atlanta Hawks.
By a freight train, of all things.
Tracks run all around State Farm Arena, a remnant of a time when the area was the site of the city’s two major passenger stations.
Both stations were torn down decades ago, but many of the tracks that remain are still frequented by freight trains running near the heart of downtown Atlanta.
“I’ve been coming to this arena for 20 years, and I’ve never seen a train stop before the game.”He seemed to imply that the Hawks had something to do with the freight train stopping at the crossing.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ATLANTA, GA - For the second straight year, the Charlotte Hornets were smacked out of the play-in round of the NBA Playoffs.
Wednesday night, the Hornets fell to the Atlanta Hawks 132-103, bringing their season to an end.
A train stopped in front of the Hornets team bus on the way to the arena pushing their arrival time 15 minutes behind schedule.
Early on, it showed as the Hornets were as flat as could be on both ends of the floor.
Washington picked up the slack offensively, leading the Hornets with 13 points in the first half.

     Young, Hunter lead Hawks to 132-103 play-in rout of Hornets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trae Young bounced back from a sluggish start to score 24 points and De’Andre Hunter led a third-quarter surge Wednesday that carried the Hawks to a 132-103 rout of the Charlotte Hornets in a play-in game.
They’ve still got to win one more play-in game just to make the playoffs, heading to Cleveland to face the Cavaliers on Friday night.
The season is over for the Hornets, who were overwhelmed in the 9-10 play-in game for the second year in a row and haven’t made the playoffs since 2016.
“I think I’m a big part of this team,” Hunter said.
The Hawks led by 13 in the first half before settling for a 60-52 advantage at the break.

     Hawks vs. Hornets score, takeaways: Atlanta advances to face Cleveland for No. 8 seed after dominant win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trae Young is defense-proofTrae Young shot 3-of-13 from the field in the first half.
They had 60 in the first half precisely because of all of the extra attention Charlotte gave to Young.
If the Hawks can give Young the right teammates, there's no reason they shouldn't be able to score like this for years to come.
LaMelo LaBustsA year ago, LaMelo Ball shot 4-of-14 in a blowout play-in loss to the Pacers.
When the Hornets stayed at home on those shooters in the second half, the Hawks got all of the layups and dunks they wanted.
