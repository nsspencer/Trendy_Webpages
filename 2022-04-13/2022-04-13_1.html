    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Charlotte Hornets had to walk to State Farm Arena, because their bus was delayed for Wednesday's game against the Atlanta Hawks.

Montrezl Harrell shared a clip (which was posted by Bleacher Report on Twitter) of the team having to walk to State Farm Arena before they played the Atlanta Hawks.
Their bus was delayed due to a train.
They ended up getting blown out by the Hawks by a score of 132-103.

     Hornets' arrival to State Farm Arena blocked by freight train
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ATLANTA (AP) — The Charlotte Hornets were delayed getting to the arena Wednesday for their NBA Play-In game against the Atlanta Hawks.
By a freight train, of all things.
Tracks run all around State Farm Arena, a remnant of a time when the area was the site of the city’s two major passenger stations.
Both stations were torn down decades ago, but many of the tracks that remain are still frequented by freight trains running near the heart of downtown Atlanta.
“I’ve been coming to this arena for 20 years, and I’ve never seen a train stop before the game.”He seemed to imply that the Hawks had something to do with the freight train stopping at the crossing.

     Recap: Hornets collapse in play-in for second straight season, lose to Hawks, 132-103
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second consecutive season, the Charlotte Hornets season ends in a blowout lost in the play-in tournament.
The Hornets went very cold from the field and missed six straight shots as the Hawks went on an 11-0 run before it was ended by a Montrezl Harrell dunk off a feed from Cody Martin.
The Hornets struggled to close out to the Hawks shooters and gave up 32 first quarter points.
At the break, the Hornets trailed by eight, with PJ Washington’s 13 point half keeping the Hornets in the game.
The Hornets fell behind by an insurmountable margin and watched their season end in disappointing fashion for the second straight year.

     Summary: As one fan appeared to wave goodbye to Bridges, he turned and fired his mouthpiece into the stands.
It ended up striking a young fan in the face.
Bridges said he intended to hit the man and not the young fan, but the act was irresponsible and unacceptable nonetheless.
That's unacceptable."
I was definitely wrong, a lot of emotions.
