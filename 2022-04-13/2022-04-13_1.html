     Hornets' arrival to State Farm Arena blocked by freight train
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ATLANTA (AP) — The Charlotte Hornets were delayed getting to the arena Wednesday for their NBA Play-In game against the Atlanta Hawks.
By a freight train, of all things.
Tracks run all around State Farm Arena, a remnant of a time when the area was the site of the city’s two major passenger stations.
Both stations were torn down decades ago, but many of the tracks that remain are still frequented by freight trains running near the heart of downtown Atlanta.
“I’ve been coming to this arena for 20 years, and I’ve never seen a train stop before the game.”He seemed to imply that the Hawks had something to do with the freight train stopping at the crossing.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trae Young is defense-proofTrae Young shot 3-of-13 from the field in the first half.
They had 60 in the first half precisely because of all of the extra attention Charlotte gave to Young.
If the Hawks can give Young the right teammates, there's no reason they shouldn't be able to score like this for years to come.
LaMelo LaBustsA year ago, LaMelo Ball shot 4-of-14 in a blowout play-in loss to the Pacers.
When the Hornets stayed at home on those shooters in the second half, the Hawks got all of the layups and dunks they wanted.
