     Hornets Bus Delayed by Train Ahead of Play-in Game vs. Hawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Hornets ran into an obstacle ahead of their play-in game on Wednesday night vs. the Hawks.
As the Hornets were nearing State Farm Arena in Atlanta, a train stopped in front of the team bus, causing the players to be late and the game to be delayed 15 minutes.
At one point, the Hornets players decided to walk the final stretch to the arena.
“I’ve been coming to this arena for 20 years, I’ve never seen the train stop before the game,” Borrego said.
Whichever team wins the first play-in game will continue onto the next play-in game, while the loser will be officially out of playoff contention.

     Recap: Hornets collapse in play-in for second straight season, lose to Hawks, 132-103
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second consecutive season, the Charlotte Hornets season ends in a blowout lost in the play-in tournament.
The Hornets went very cold from the field and missed six straight shots as the Hawks went on an 11-0 run before it was ended by a Montrezl Harrell dunk off a feed from Cody Martin.
The Hornets struggled to close out to the Hawks shooters and gave up 32 first quarter points.
At the break, the Hornets trailed by eight, with PJ Washington’s 13 point half keeping the Hornets in the game.
The Hornets fell behind by an insurmountable margin and watched their season end in disappointing fashion for the second straight year.

     The Michael Jordan factoid that makes Hornets Play-In loss sting more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As great as Michael Jordan was as a basketball player, the team owner just isn’t enough to turn things around for the Charlotte Hornets.
The Hornets are missing the playoffs once again after getting blown out in the play-in for the second straight year.
Even Jordan himself couldn’t end a playoff drought that now spans two decades, per CBS Sports.
They did show improvements this 2021-22, but for any NBA team, there isn’t anything to celebrate unless it’s the Larry O’Brien trophy.
MJ might have six rings as a player, but for now, he has to wait for a bit longer to get his first as a team owner.

     Hornets' arrival to State Farm Arena blocked by freight train
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ATLANTA (AP) — The Charlotte Hornets were delayed getting to the arena Wednesday for their NBA Play-In game against the Atlanta Hawks.
By a freight train, of all things.
Tracks run all around State Farm Arena, a remnant of a time when the area was the site of the city’s two major passenger stations.
Both stations were torn down decades ago, but many of the tracks that remain are still frequented by freight trains running near the heart of downtown Atlanta.
“I’ve been coming to this arena for 20 years, and I’ve never seen a train stop before the game.”He seemed to imply that the Hawks had something to do with the freight train stopping at the crossing.

     Atlanta Hawks keep foot on gas in play-in rout of Charlotte Hornets

     Summary: Trae Young drops 24 points and dishes out 10 assists, leading the Hawks to a big win over the Hornets in the play-in tournament.
(2:29)ATLANTA -- Atlanta Hawks coach Nate McMillan took some heat from his coaching staff -- as well as some fans on social media -- for having starters on the court with just over five minutes left in Wednesday night's 132-103 play-in victory over the Charlotte Hornets.
Atlanta will play the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, with the winner advancing to the Eastern Conference playoffs as the eighth seed against No.
Hunter had 22 points, including 16 in the third quarter when Atlanta outscored the Hornets 42-24.
Hunter in particular gave the Hawks a boost they needed with star guard Trae Young struggling from the field.

     Summary: Trae Young is defense-proofTrae Young shot 3-of-13 from the field in the first half.
They had 60 in the first half precisely because of all of the extra attention Charlotte gave to Young.
If the Hawks can give Young the right teammates, there's no reason they shouldn't be able to score like this for years to come.
LaMelo LaBustsA year ago, LaMelo Ball shot 4-of-14 in a blowout play-in loss to the Pacers.
When the Hornets stayed at home on those shooters in the second half, the Hawks got all of the layups and dunks they wanted.
