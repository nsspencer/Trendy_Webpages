     Summary: Kidnapping Hoax Plea Deal In California(Sacramento, CA) — A Redding woman who made national headlines about a story that she was kidnapped and tortured six years ago now says the whole thing was a hoax and she feels ashamed, but she faces federal criminal charges.
It’s the story of Sherri Papini, the 39-year-old mother of two claiming two masked Hispanic women kidnapped her while out jogging that included lurid details of torture, branding and chained in a bedroom.
The Redding community welcomed her back when she reappeared.
On Tuesday, Papini signed a plea agreement of lying to Federal Agents and fraud that could put her in prison for five years and a quarter-million in fines.
It turns out in reality she was staying with a former boyfriend in Costa Mesa.

     Sherri Papini, Northern California woman who faked 2016 kidnapping, signs plea deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sherri Papini, the Northern California woman accused of faking her own kidnapping in 2016, has signed a plea deal and will confess she made up the entire plan, her attorney’s office confirmed to CNN.
As CNN previously reported, Papini was reported missing by her husband in November 2016 after she had gone out for a jog near her home in Shasta County.
Three weeks later, on Thanksgiving Day, she was found alone on an interstate highway 140 miles from home.
She told police she had been abducted and branded by two women who kept her chained in a closet.
“We are taking this case in an entirely new direction,” Portanova, a former federal prosecutor, told The Sacramento Bee.

     Sherri Papini Agrees to Plead Guilty Over California Kidnapping Hoax
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A California woman who was arrested last month on charges including making false statements to federal law enforcement in connection with a kidnapping hoax has signed a plea deal.
Sherri Papini, 39, has agreed to plead guilty to making materially false statements to FBI agents and committing mail fraud “based on her being a kidnapping victim,” U.S. U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert said on Tuesday.
Under the terms of the deal, she will plead guilty to one count each of mail fraud and making false statements.
She currently faces a maximum of five years behind bars (and a fine of as much as $250,000) in connection with the making false statements charge.
The mail fraud count, meanwhile, carries a maximum of 20 years, as well as its own fine of up to $250,000.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Northern California woman's disappearance more than five years ago shocked the tight-knit community of Redding, California.
Neighbors volunteered for grid searches and law enforcement made finding Papini a top priority.
"We used to walk and my husband and I said, 'I'm not going to go walk by myself anymore,'" Redding resident Maria Flores said.
Private investigator Bill Garcia was so concerned about Papini, he volunteered his services to her family.
That's money that could have gone into other missing women investigations.

     Summary: But in reality, Papini was never kidnapped, according to the Justice Department.
Portanova told the Bee on Tuesday that her legal team was “taking this case in an entirely new direction.”“Everything that has happened before today stops today,” he said.
Papini will pay more than $300,000 in restitution to local, state and federal agencies, according to the plea agreement.
A court date has yet to be scheduled for Papini to enter her guilty pleas, but Portanova told the Associated Press that she will probably enter them next week.
The man later told authorities that he helped Papini “run away” when she claimed her husband was abusing her, according to court documents.
