     Summary: Kidnapping Hoax Plea Deal In California(Sacramento, CA) — A Redding woman who made national headlines about a story that she was kidnapped and tortured six years ago now says the whole thing was a hoax and she feels ashamed, but she faces federal criminal charges.
It’s the story of Sherri Papini, the 39-year-old mother of two claiming two masked Hispanic women kidnapped her while out jogging that included lurid details of torture, branding and chained in a bedroom.
The Redding community welcomed her back when she reappeared.
On Tuesday, Papini signed a plea agreement of lying to Federal Agents and fraud that could put her in prison for five years and a quarter-million in fines.
It turns out in reality she was staying with a former boyfriend in Costa Mesa.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Northern California woman's disappearance more than five years ago shocked the tight-knit community of Redding, California.
Neighbors volunteered for grid searches and law enforcement made finding Papini a top priority.
"We used to walk and my husband and I said, 'I'm not going to go walk by myself anymore,'" Redding resident Maria Flores said.
Private investigator Bill Garcia was so concerned about Papini, he volunteered his services to her family.
That's money that could have gone into other missing women investigations.

     Summary: Sherri Papini, the Northern California woman accused of faking her own kidnapping in 2016, has signed a plea deal and will confess she made up the entire plan, her attorney’s office confirmed to CNN.
As CNN previously reported, Papini was reported missing by her husband in November 2016 after she had gone out for a jog near her home in Shasta County.
Three weeks later, on Thanksgiving Day, she was found alone on an interstate highway 140 miles from home.
She told police she had been abducted and branded by two women who kept her chained in a closet.
“We are taking this case in an entirely new direction,” Portanova, a former federal prosecutor, told The Sacramento Bee.

     Summary: (Shasta County Sheriff's Office, Getty Images)SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California mom Sherri Papini, who faked her own kidnapping for three weeks in 2016, has signed a plea agreement in which she admits to her actions.
Papini, 39, of Redding, has agreed to plead guilty to two of the 35 federal charges against her.
Court documents show she will admit to committing mail fraud and making false statements to a federal agent.
She also committed mail fraud based on the hoax, the documents state.
The mail fraud charge stems from the more than $30,000 Papini received from the California Victim’s Compensation Board after her return.

     Summary: But in reality, Papini was never kidnapped, according to the Justice Department.
Portanova told the Bee on Tuesday that her legal team was “taking this case in an entirely new direction.”“Everything that has happened before today stops today,” he said.
Papini will pay more than $300,000 in restitution to local, state and federal agencies, according to the plea agreement.
A court date has yet to be scheduled for Papini to enter her guilty pleas, but Portanova told the Associated Press that she will probably enter them next week.
The man later told authorities that he helped Papini “run away” when she claimed her husband was abusing her, according to court documents.
