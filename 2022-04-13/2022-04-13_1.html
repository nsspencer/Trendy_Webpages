     Hornets Bus Delayed by Train Ahead of Play-in Game vs. Hawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Hornets ran into an obstacle ahead of their play-in game on Wednesday night vs. the Hawks.
As the Hornets were nearing State Farm Arena in Atlanta, a train stopped in front of the team bus, causing the players to be late and the game to be delayed 15 minutes.
At one point, the Hornets players decided to walk the final stretch to the arena.
“I’ve been coming to this arena for 20 years, I’ve never seen the train stop before the game,” Borrego said.
Whichever team wins the first play-in game will continue onto the next play-in game, while the loser will be officially out of playoff contention.

     Recap: Hornets collapse in play-in for second straight season, lose to Hawks, 132-103
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second consecutive season, the Charlotte Hornets season ends in a blowout lost in the play-in tournament.
The Hornets went very cold from the field and missed six straight shots as the Hawks went on an 11-0 run before it was ended by a Montrezl Harrell dunk off a feed from Cody Martin.
The Hornets struggled to close out to the Hawks shooters and gave up 32 first quarter points.
At the break, the Hornets trailed by eight, with PJ Washington’s 13 point half keeping the Hornets in the game.
The Hornets fell behind by an insurmountable margin and watched their season end in disappointing fashion for the second straight year.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Miles Bridges offers up an apology for his reaction to being ejected from the game against the Hawks.
(0:48)Charlotte Hornets forward Miles Bridges struck a young fan with his mouthpiece after he was ejected from the team's 132-103 play-in loss to the host Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night, later calling his actions as he exited the court "unacceptable."
"I was aiming for the guy that was screaming at me and it hit a little girl," Bridges said.
"So that's definitely unacceptable on my part and I take full responsibility.
Asked about Bridges' actions after the loss, Charlotte coach James Borrego said he wasn't aware of what happened.

     Hornets' arrival to State Farm Arena blocked by freight train
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ATLANTA (AP) — The Charlotte Hornets were delayed getting to the arena Wednesday for their NBA Play-In game against the Atlanta Hawks.
By a freight train, of all things.
Tracks run all around State Farm Arena, a remnant of a time when the area was the site of the city’s two major passenger stations.
Both stations were torn down decades ago, but many of the tracks that remain are still frequented by freight trains running near the heart of downtown Atlanta.
“I’ve been coming to this arena for 20 years, and I’ve never seen a train stop before the game.”He seemed to imply that the Hawks had something to do with the freight train stopping at the crossing.

     Summary: As one fan appeared to wave goodbye to Bridges, he turned and fired his mouthpiece into the stands.
It ended up striking a young fan in the face.
Bridges said he intended to hit the man and not the young fan, but the act was irresponsible and unacceptable nonetheless.
That's unacceptable."
I was definitely wrong, a lot of emotions.
