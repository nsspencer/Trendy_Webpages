     Atletico Madrid's Partial Stadium Closure Order Suspended Ahead Of Man City Second Leg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Atletico Madrid's Wanda Metropolitano is set to be full for the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City.
This was announced on Wednesday, hours before kick-off in the second leg.
In addition to the the partial stadium closure, Atletico were fined €5,250 and ordered to display a banner with the wording “#NoToRacism” and the UEFA logo at Wednesday's game with City.
But the Court of Arbitration for Sport granted a suspension after "considering the serious repercussions to local security if the partial stadium closure had to be enforced at this late stage".
Real beat reigning champions Chelsea 5-4 on aggregate in their quarter-final, despite losing the second leg 3-2 at home on Tuesday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His City faced Real Madrid in the last 16 in 2020 and won comfortably enough (4–2 on aggregate), pressing Zinedine Zidane’s side into errors.
German referee Daniel Siebert had been curiously lax throughout, allowing Atlético’s gamesmanship and intimidation, but as City largely maintained its discipline, Atlético’s antics eventually backfired.
City had roughly two-thirds of the ball and, without overcommitting, did pose a consistent threat in the first half.
Atlético went direct and pressed hard and for a time, as the atmosphere swelled, City looked rattled.
It drew 3–3 on the day for a 6–4 aggregate win to set up a semifinal against Villarreal, another England-Spain showdown.

     Summary: In the end, it was Pep Guardiola getting the better of Diego Simeone in the battle of contrasting styles in the Champions League.
“In the second half, they were better than us and we were lucky that we didn’t concede,” said Guardiola, who became the first coach to reach nine Champions League semifinals.
Atlético is now winless in its last seven Champions League games at home, while City is unbeaten in its last 13 away games in all competitions, with 10 wins.
Playing in its 100th Champions League game from group stage to final, City controlled possession early on and kept Atlético from creating any significant threat.
“We had our chances,” Atlético midfielder Koke Resurrección said.

     Man City see off Atletico in fiery clash to reach semi-finals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The trouble began on the pitch, as Atletico defender Felipe sparked a huge brawl in the corner after a taking a wild swipe at City's Phil Foden.
But City survived the early, physical onslaught and established control, even if Atletico looked a threat on the break, failing only with their final pass.
De Paul's first touch was to fire just past the post and City were retreating now, camped in their own half, accepting or unable to prevent the Atletico pressure.
A swarm of players, substitutes and staff rushed in and it was only a few minutes later that Felipe was sent off.
With nine minutes of added time, Gundogan should have settled it for City but Atleti survived.
