     Atletico Madrid's Partial Stadium Closure Order Suspended Ahead Of Man City Second Leg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Atletico Madrid's Wanda Metropolitano is set to be full for the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City.
This was announced on Wednesday, hours before kick-off in the second leg.
In addition to the the partial stadium closure, Atletico were fined €5,250 and ordered to display a banner with the wording “#NoToRacism” and the UEFA logo at Wednesday's game with City.
But the Court of Arbitration for Sport granted a suspension after "considering the serious repercussions to local security if the partial stadium closure had to be enforced at this late stage".
Real beat reigning champions Chelsea 5-4 on aggregate in their quarter-final, despite losing the second leg 3-2 at home on Tuesday.

     Man City and Atletico players in post-match tunnel altercation after brawl during Champions League tie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City and Atletico Madrid players were involved in an on-pitch brawl and post-game tunnel altercation in a hot-tempered Champions League quarter-final.
Felipe was shown a second yellow card by referee Daniel Siebert, while Nathan Ake and former City defender Stefan Savic were also cautioned after the incident.
Broadcast images appeared to show Savic in conversation with Jack Grealish, with the Montenegrin seemingly grabbing the City man by the hair.
BT Sport then reported police officers present in the Wanda Metropolitano tunnel after the match, with Savic again involved.
After the match, City manager Pep Guardiola said he had “nothing to say” on Atletico’s tactics or conduct, as well as a perceived targeting of Phil Foden.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His City faced Real Madrid in the last 16 in 2020 and won comfortably enough (4–2 on aggregate), pressing Zinedine Zidane’s side into errors.
German referee Daniel Siebert had been curiously lax throughout, allowing Atlético’s gamesmanship and intimidation, but as City largely maintained its discipline, Atlético’s antics eventually backfired.
City had roughly two-thirds of the ball and, without overcommitting, did pose a consistent threat in the first half.
Atlético went direct and pressed hard and for a time, as the atmosphere swelled, City looked rattled.
It drew 3–3 on the day for a 6–4 aggregate win to set up a semifinal against Villarreal, another England-Spain showdown.

     Summary: In the end, it was Pep Guardiola getting the better of Diego Simeone in the battle of contrasting styles in the Champions League.
Atlético is now winless in its last seven Champions League games at home, while City is unbeaten in its last 13 away games in all competitions, with 10 wins.
Playing in its 100th Champions League game from group stage to final, City controlled possession early on and kept Atlético from creating any significant threat.

City had one of its best chances when Ilkay Gundogan hit the post from close range in the 30th.
