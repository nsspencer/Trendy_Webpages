     Protesters call for accountability following release of Grand Rapids police shooting video

     Summary: GRAND RAPIDS – Demonstrators in Grand Rapids had a message for police during a march Wednesday: Enough is enough, and accountability is needed now.
For many who marched, Lyoya's death was a sign that the police reform and accountability pledged in 2020 in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis has been inconsequential.
"I don't think the establishment are ever gonna listen to us," said Bryan Foster, a Black man who attended demonstrations.

City of Grand Rapids salt trucks were used to cordon off certain roads to vehicles while the march took place.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grand Rapids — Amid public outcry for transparency, police in Grand Rapids released videos Wednesday that showed a White officer shoot a Black man following a struggle that ensued last week during a traffic stop.
In the released video, the officer tells Lyoya he was pulled over because his license plate didn't match his vehicle.
The struggle over the stun gun lasted about 90 seconds, Grand Rapids police Chief Eric Winstrom said.
After seeing that video, I wanted to come down here.“Cassandra Gomez, 23 of Grand Rapids, said she knows Lyoya’s girlfriend.
Cohle said his office will work with any board-certified forensic pathologist, should the Lyoya family seek an independent autopsy or assist them.
