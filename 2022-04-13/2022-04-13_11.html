     Russian Navy Confirms Severe Damage to Black Sea Cruiser Moskva, Crew Abandoned Ship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Russian Navy’s Black Sea flagship has suffered major damage and the crew has abandoned the ship, state media said late Tuesday in reports following Ukrainian claims of hitting the ship with a missile strike.
The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the mishap on RTS Moskva (121), a ship in the country’s Black Sea Fleet, according to state-run outlet TASS.
The crew of the Moskva the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet was severely damaged and the crew abandoned ship, the Russian Defense Ministry told TASS.
Ukrainian officials claimed that shore-based anti-ship guided missiles hit Moskva which had been operating from the Black Sea Fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol, Crimea.

     Russia: Major Black Sea fleet ship damaged in blast after Ukraine claimed strike
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed Wednesday that its Moskva missile cruiser was badly damaged in a fire — hours after Ukrainian forces claimed they'd struck the vessel in the Black Sea.
Why it matters: The Moskva is the most essential ship in the Russian Black Sea fleet, with cruise missiles that have a range of at least 440 miles, per Reuters.
Maksym Marchenko claimed in a Telegram post hours earlier that Ukrainian missiles "guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage to the Russian ship."
Flashback: The Moskva was the warship that reportedly told Ukrainian border guards to surrender Snake Island, off Ukraine's coast in the Black Sea.
Editor's note: This article has been updated with more comment from the Russian Defense Ministry, remarks by Zelensky and further context.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday, 13 April, the Russian military reported that one of its largest warships, the Moskva Project 1164 missile cruiser, suffered “severe damage” after ammunition exploded onboard.
The Moskva is the largest warship in Russia’s Black Sea fleet, and the incident could form a pivotal moment in the conflict.
All Russian reports have yet to acknowledge any mention of a Ukrainian strike causing the large fire on board.

     Did Ukraine Strike, And Possibly Sink, The Moskva, A Major Russian Warship?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reports in Russian state-run media appear to confirm social media chatter that a premier Russian warship, the Moskva, has been badly damaged — and is perhaps burning or even sinking — in the Black Sea.
The Russian MoD is claiming that ammunition exploded on the Black Sea Fleet's flagship, the Moskva Project 1164 missile cruiser, and that it has sustained serious damage.
https://t.co/oILnqUmdXf pic.twitter.com/ISQfGGFQ7I — Rob Lee (@RALee85) April 13, 2022Slava-class cruisers are, in Russian naval doctrine, intended to directly engage with American and other western naval warships.
The claim is not the first claim of Ukrainians sinking a Russian ship.
But a similar claim in March — that a landing ship had been struck at port in Berdyansk by Ukrainian missiles — was true.

     Russian navy evacuates flagship Moskva in Black Sea. Ukraine claims it was hit by a missile

     Summary: Russian sailors have evacuated the guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet, after a fire that detonated ammunition aboard, Russian state media reported Wednesday.
But hours earlier, a Ukrainian official claimed the Russian warship had been hit by cruise missiles fired from Ukraine.
The Russian Navy cruiser Moskva, bottom, is seen in port in Sevastopol, Crimea, on April 7.
This is a Russian military warship.
A Ukrainian soldier responded: "Russian warship, go f*** yourself."

     One Of Russia’s Biggest Cruisers Just Sank Near Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo via Wikimedia CommonsA Ukrainian navy missile battery reportedly has struck the Russian navy cruiser Moskva off the coast of Odessa, a strategic port city on the Black Sea in southwest Ukraine.
“Neptune missiles … caused very serious damage to the Russian ship,” Marchenko said.
But the pre-war Ukrainian navy probably possessed just one Neptune battery out of the half-dozen or so it planned to induct this spring.
A Neptune battery includes a truck-mounted launcher with four rounds, a command truck and a pair of resupply trucks plus links to a mobile Mineral-U radar with a 370-mile range.
Those defenses—mines, anti-tank missiles, long-range ballistic missiles and armed drones—make any amphibious operation against a Ukrainian port extremely risky for the attackers.

     Russian Ship Made Famous at Snake Island Evacuates Crew After Blast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Russian warship famously cursed out by Ukrainian border guards has been seriously damaged, with both countries' militaries offering conflicting explanations.
The Russian military said Tuesday that naval cruiser Moskva was evacuated in response to an explosion.
However, Ukrainian officials said its military had struck the cruiser that was made famous after border guards told the Russian warship's crew to "go f*** yourself."
A fire detonated ammunition on Moskva, causing its entire crew to flee the cruiser, Russian news agency TASS reported Tuesday, citing the country's defense ministry.
The ship has played a key role in Russian military operations in the Mediterranean Sea.
