     Roberto Firmino Becomes 4th Liverpool Player To Score 20+ UCL Goals As Reds Reach Semi-Finals

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Roberto Firmino Becomes 4th Liverpool Player To Score 20+ UCL Goals As Reds Reach Semi-FinalsRoberto Firmino proved yet again that he is a man who delivers on European nights.
The Brazilian is generally known more for being a team player, rather than a prolific scorer himself.
But he improved his already excellent Champions League goals record as Liverpool booked their place in the semi-finals.
That was his 20th Champions League goal.
The Portuguese side contributed to a Champions League classic with some excellent attacking play of their own.

     Liverpool in Champions League semis, quadruple dreams alive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APLIVERPOOL, England (AP) — A place in the Champions League semifinals secured.
Liverpool is in a good place entering the home straight of what could turn out to be the club’s greatest ever season.
Even conceding two late goals to draw 3-3 at home to Benfica couldn’t take the smile of Jurgen Klopp’s face.
Roberto Firmino's second-half double put Liverpool 3-1 ahead on the night and 6-2 ahead on aggregate, only for Klopp's team to ease off the pace.
The Brazilian volleyed in Tsimikas’ free kick to make it 3-1 but Liverpool let Benfica back into the match.

     Benfica shows Jürgen Klopp finally has Liverpool trait that he has never had and will not repeat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the previous night's Champions League results, there was something ominously nonchalant about Jürgen Klopp's decision to make a whopping seven changes in Liverpool's quarter-final second leg against Benfica.
After all, two-goal leads, as the common adage goes, are one of most fragile leads in the world of football.
One that Benfica capitalised on, making Liverpool sweat until the last minute of the game.
Benfica might object to the term 'cruise', but ultimately they never ate into the two-goal advantage that existed at kick-off.
With this squad, Liverpool are invincible.

     Summary: Roberto Firmino celebrates after scoring a goal against Benfica in the Champions League.
PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty ImagesRoberto Firmino scored twice as Liverpool drew 3-3 with a gutsy Benfica on Wednesday to advance to the Champions League semifinals 6-4 on aggregate.
Benfica pulled one back just after the half-hour mark through Goncalo Ramos and the teams went into the break tied at 1-1 with Liverpool leading 4-2 on aggregate.
Benfica admirably stuck at the task and pulled two goals back in the latter stages to return a minor degree of tension to Anfield.
As we advanced the opponents became more difficult, but we gave a good account of ourselves," said Benfica manager Nelson Verissimo.

     Klopp’s selection risk pays off as Liverpool move step closer to final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Klopp rested seven of the star turns who started last week’s 3-1 first leg win at Benfica.
There was no Virgil van Dijk, Sadio Mané, Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson, Thiago Alcântara or Fabinho.
“Mo Salah, Mo Salah” came the chants from around a venue well versed in European nights like this one.
That was bookended by two other offside strikes before the final whistle sounded and Liverpool were through having never endured any real peril.
In the Premier League Liverpool trail City by a point with seven matches left each and they have secured the Carabao Cup.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool’s second-leg draw ensured an aggregate win over Benfica while Manchester City edge out Atletico Madrid after deadlock.
Liverpool set up a Champions League semi-final with Spain’s Villarreal after Roberto Firmino scored twice in a 3-3 second-leg draw with Benfica to ensure a 6-4 aggregate win.
Liverpool manager Klopp made seven changes to the team, which drew with Manchester City at the weekend, but his squad showed their improved strength in depth with Luis Diaz and Kostas Tsimikas particularly impressing.
Elsewhere, there were scuffles on and off the pitch as Manchester City played out a nerve-racking goalless draw at Atletico Madrid that earned the English side a place in the Champions League semi-finals.
City, bidding to win European club football’s most prestigious trophy for the first time, will play record 13-times champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals.
