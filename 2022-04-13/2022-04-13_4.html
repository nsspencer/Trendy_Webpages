     Daring Fireball: Giants’ Alyssa Nakken Becomes First On-Field Woman Coach in MLB History
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Maria Guardado, reporting for MLB.com:Alyssa Nakken broke another historic barrier on Tuesday night, becoming the first woman to coach on the field in a Major League game in the Giants’ 13-2 victory over the Padres at Oracle Park.
Nakken took over as the Giants’ first-base coach in the top of the third inning after Antoan Richardson was ejected from the game by crew chief Greg Gibson following a dispute with Padres third-base coach Mike Shildt.
Nakken said bench coach Kai Correa came down to the batting cages and told her she would be replacing Richardson.
And so she made her on-field coaching debut with the Giants, who originally hired the 31-year-old as an assistant coach in January 2020.

     Summary: Choose your plan ArrowRight Nakken, an assistant who works with Giants players on baserunning and outfield defense, became the first woman in MLB history to coach on the field after the ejection of Antoan Richardson.
Her moment arrived when Richardson was ejected for responding to what he said was a comment with “undertones of racism” by Padres third base coach Mike Shildt.
Per Richardson, Shildt was looking into the Giants dugout for pitcher Alex Wood.
And that’s really unfortunate that’s what happened tonight.
Last night, Antoan Richardson said Padres coach Mike Shildt yelled at him with "undertones of racism."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At first glance, Tuesday night’s game between the San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres didn’t seem out of the ordinary.
However, MLB history was made during the contest.
Giants assistant coach Alyssa Nakken entered the game as the team’s first base coach, making history as the first woman to coach on the field during an MLB regular season game.
A softball star at Sacramento State, Nakken was hired by Giants manager Gabe Kapler back in 2020.
With Nakken and Balkovec leading the way, it might not be long before a woman occupies the managerial chair in an MLB dugout.
