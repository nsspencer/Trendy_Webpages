     Roberto Firmino Becomes 4th Liverpool Player To Score 20+ UCL Goals As Reds Reach Semi-Finals

     Summary: Roberto Firmino Becomes 4th Liverpool Player To Score 20+ UCL Goals As Reds Reach Semi-FinalsRoberto Firmino proved yet again that he is a man who delivers on European nights.
The Brazilian is generally known more for being a team player, rather than a prolific scorer himself.
But he improved his already excellent Champions League goals record as Liverpool booked their place in the semi-finals.
That was his 20th Champions League goal.
The Portuguese side contributed to a Champions League classic with some excellent attacking play of their own.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool’s second-leg draw ensured an aggregate win over Benfica while Manchester City edge out Atletico Madrid after deadlock.
Liverpool set up a Champions League semi-final with Spain’s Villarreal after Roberto Firmino scored twice in a 3-3 second-leg draw with Benfica to ensure a 6-4 aggregate win.
Liverpool manager Klopp made seven changes to the team, which drew with Manchester City at the weekend, but his squad showed their improved strength in depth with Luis Diaz and Kostas Tsimikas particularly impressing.
Elsewhere, there were scuffles on and off the pitch as Manchester City played out a nerve-racking goalless draw at Atletico Madrid that earned the English side a place in the Champions League semi-finals.
City, bidding to win European club football’s most prestigious trophy for the first time, will play record 13-times champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals.

PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty ImagesRoberto Firmino scored twice as Liverpool drew 3-3 with a gutsy Benfica on Wednesday to advance to the Champions League semifinals 6-4 on aggregate.
Benfica pulled one back just after the half-hour mark through Goncalo Ramos and the teams went into the break tied at 1-1 with Liverpool leading 4-2 on aggregate.
Benfica admirably stuck at the task and pulled two goals back in the latter stages to return a minor degree of tension to Anfield.
As we advanced the opponents became more difficult, but we gave a good account of ourselves," said Benfica manager Nelson Verissimo.

     Summary: APLIVERPOOL, England (AP) — A place in the Champions League semifinals secured.
Liverpool is in a good place entering the home straight of what could turn out to be the club’s greatest ever season.
Even conceding two late goals to draw 3-3 at home to Benfica couldn’t take the smile of Jurgen Klopp’s face.
Roberto Firmino's second-half double put Liverpool 3-1 ahead on the night and 6-2 ahead on aggregate, only for Klopp's team to ease off the pace.
The Brazilian volleyed in Tsimikas’ free kick to make it 3-1 but Liverpool let Benfica back into the match.

     Summary: Jürgen Klopp declared himself delighted to take Liverpool into the Champions League semi-finals for the third time in his reign and said he would never take such achievements for granted.
Klopp made seven changes before the FA Cup semi-final with Manchester City on Saturday and blamed himself for the defensive difficulties of a back four who had never played together.
Benfica capitalised on their absence and Klopp said: “They scored really good goals but it should not be as easy as it was tonight.
They have probably the most successful cup competition manager in world football so he knows what he is doing.
Unai Emery is the king of the cups.

If they are to overcome Man City on multiple fronts this season, the squad depth will be key.
Man City set number one targetGuardiola may not be able to do much about his ‘trouble’ until the end of the season, but Man City will undoubtedly look for a fix in the transfer market come the summer.
Capable of playing as a defensive midfielder or further forward, Tchouaméni has also reportedly caught the eye of Liverpool.
