     Six Outs From a Perfect Game, Kershaw’s Day Was Done
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clayton Kershaw has won three National League Cy Young Awards, one N.L.
Most Valuable Player Award and a World Series.
He has thrown a no-hitter and compiled a near-certain Hall of Fame résumé.
But he has never thrown a perfect game, and his best chance at accomplishing that exceptionally rare feat may have disappeared thanks to circumstances including a manager’s decision, his age and recent injury history and, possibly even, the owner-imposed lockout that threw Major League Baseball into uncertainty this winter.
Dodgers 7, Twins 0 | Box Score | Play-by-PlayKershaw, 34, was absolutely dominant in his first start of the season, striking out 13 Minnesota Twins over seven innings and 80 pitches on a cold, 38-degree day at Target Field in Minneapolis.

     Clayton Kershaw Says Dodgers Made ‘Right Choice’ in Pulling Him From Perfect Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clayton Kershaw was perfect through seven innings on Wednesday afternoon, but Dave Roberts and the Dodgers ultimately decided to pull him from the game due to pitch count.
His pull was controversial for fans, as they were hoping to see just the 24th perfect MLB game in history.
However, Kershaw thinks Roberts made “the right decision” when choosing to take him from the game.
As much as I would have wanted to do it, I’ve thrown 75 pitches in a sim game.

     Dodgers: National Reporter Rips Dave Roberts For Pulling Clayton Kershaw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dodgers manager Dave Roberts made the fateful decision to pull the three-time Cy Young winner after 80 pitches.
Predictably, the baseball world responded to Roberts' decision.
Many fans sided with Passan's critical take that the Dodgers should have let Kershaw pitch and have a shot at history.
The LA Times' Jack Harris provided fans with Roberts' thought process on pulling the Dodgers icon.
It wasn't a popular move among Dodgers fans, but it's a decision that should hopefully help ensure that Kershaw is healthy come October.

     Dodgers 7, Twins 0: Absolutely Imperfect Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He was up against less than ideal circumstances between just being traded, facing a deadly Dodgers lineup, and dealing with cold weather, and he did alright.
He’s the greatest pitcher of his generation and has accomplished everything he possibly could- besides a perfect game.
I won’t listen to any defense of the decision to yank him and deprive him of trying (the way he was dominating, succeeding) for the 24th perfect game in MLB history.
Alex Vesia entered for the Dodgers, and gave up the Twins’ only two baserunners, a single by Gary Sanchez and a walk of Max Kepler.
In the bottom of the 9th, the Twins went down without a whimper, and mercifully brought an end to this two-game series.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Dodgers southpaw Clayton Kershaw was removed from a perfect game bid on Wednesday afternoon against the Minnesota Twins.
Vesia subsequently surrendered a single to Gary Sánchez, dashing any hopes Los Angeles had of making history.
"As much as I would have wanted to do it, I've thrown 75 pitches in a sim game," Kershaw told reporters.
The only perfect game in Dodgers history was thrown by Sandy Koufax in September 1965.
Major League Baseball's most recent perfect game occurred when former Seattle Mariners ace Félix Hernández hurled one on August 15, 2012 against the Tampa Bay Rays.

Kershaw took a perfect game through seven innings for the Dodgers until he was pulled after 80 pitches, dominating the Twins with 13 strikeouts in 21 batters during a 7-0 victory Wednesday.
Cody Bellinger, Gavin Lux and Austin Barnes hit back-to-back-to-back home runs in the eighth against reliever Dereck Rodriguez, who made his Twins debut.
Walker Buehler came out after six innings in May 2018, Rich Hill left with a blister after seven perfect innings in September 2016, and Ross Stripling was removed after 7 1/3 innings in April 2016.

Clayton Kershaw heads back to the Dodgers dugout with a smile on his face after pitching seven perfect innings.
According to Roberts, Kershaw said he could go at least another inning, feeling comfortable to throw 80-85.
And to see a battery of him and Austin throw a perfect game or a no-hitter, I’m all in.
“It was time.”Kershaw’s one regret was not giving Barnes, his longtime friend and battery mate, the chance to catch a perfect game.
