    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City and Atletico Madrid players were involved in an on-pitch brawl and post-game tunnel altercation in a hot-tempered Champions League quarter-final.
Felipe was shown a second yellow card by referee Daniel Siebert, while Nathan Ake and former City defender Stefan Savic were also cautioned after the incident.
Broadcast images appeared to show Savic in conversation with Jack Grealish, with the Montenegrin seemingly grabbing the City man by the hair.
BT Sport then reported police officers present in the Wanda Metropolitano tunnel after the match, with Savic again involved.
After the match, City manager Pep Guardiola said he had “nothing to say” on Atletico’s tactics or conduct, as well as a perceived targeting of Phil Foden.

     Summary: APMADRID (AP) — In the end, it was Pep Guardiola getting the better of Diego Simeone in the battle of contrasting styles in the Champions League.
Atlético is now winless in its last seven Champions League games at home, while City is unbeaten in its last 13 away games in all competitions, with 10 wins.
Playing in its 100th Champions League game from group stage to final, City controlled possession early on and kept Atlético from creating any significant threat.
“We had our chances,” Atlético midfielder Koke Resurrección said.
City had one of its best chances when Ilkay Gundogan hit the post from close range in the 30th.

     Summary: Atletico Madrid were unable to score the goal they needed on Wednesday as Manchester City advanced to the Champions League semi-finalsMadrid (AFP) – Manchester City held off a late surge by Atletico Madrid on Wednesday as a bad-tempered stalemate at the Wanda Metropolitano saw Pep Guardiola's side safely through to the Champions League semi-finals.
City will now face Real Madrid, with Liverpool up against Villarreal in the other semi to complete an all Spanish-English line-up in the last four.
But City survived the early, physical onslaught and established control, even if Atletico looked a threat on the break, failing only with their final pass.
Antoine Griezmann dipped a volley just wide of the post, Ederson lashed a nervy punt downfield and Marcos Llorente barged the ball off Joao Cancelo.
De Paul's first touch was to fire just past the post and City were retreating now, camped in their own half, accepting or unable to prevent the Atletico pressure.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His City faced Real Madrid in the last 16 in 2020 and won comfortably enough (4–2 on aggregate), pressing Zinedine Zidane’s side into errors.
German referee Daniel Siebert had been curiously lax throughout, allowing Atlético’s gamesmanship and intimidation, but as City largely maintained its discipline, Atlético’s antics eventually backfired.
City had roughly two-thirds of the ball and, without overcommitting, did pose a consistent threat in the first half.
Atlético went direct and pressed hard and for a time, as the atmosphere swelled, City looked rattled.
It drew 3–3 on the day for a 6–4 aggregate win to set up a semifinal against Villarreal, another England-Spain showdown.
