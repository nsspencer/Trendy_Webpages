     Russia: Major Black Sea fleet ship damaged in blast after Ukraine claimed strike
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed Wednesday that its Moskva missile cruiser was badly damaged in a fire — hours after Ukrainian forces claimed they'd struck the vessel in the Black Sea.
Why it matters: The Moskva is the most essential ship in the Russian Black Sea fleet, with cruise missiles that have a range of at least 440 miles, per Reuters.
Maksym Marchenko claimed in a Telegram post hours earlier that Ukrainian missiles "guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage to the Russian ship."
Flashback: The Moskva was the warship that reportedly told Ukrainian border guards to surrender Snake Island, off Ukraine's coast in the Black Sea.
Editor's note: This article has been updated with more comment from the Russian Defense Ministry, remarks by Zelensky and further context.

     Ukraine says it struck Russia’s Black Sea flagship in missile attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ArrowRight But whatever happened to the Russian navy missile cruiser Moskva — the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet — the episode serves as a significant morale boost for beleaguered Ukrainian forces and a major blow to Russia, military experts said.
Hours later, the Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged that a key ship in its Black Sea fleet had suffered significant damage but did not address the Ukrainian claims.
All of the ship’s approximately 500 crew members were evacuated to other Black Sea Fleet ships in the area, Russia said.
Russia’s Defense Ministry later said that “the fire on the cruiser Moskva has been localized” and that “explosions of ammunition have been stopped,” the RIA Novosti news agency reported.
“The flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, the Moskva cruiser, was indeed attacked by the Neptune anti-ship missiles from the coastline between Odessa and Nikolaev,” it said.
