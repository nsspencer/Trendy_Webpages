     Summary: We also establish that although Marc can be a brutal mercenary, he often stops short of being deadly with his human combatants.
When Marc threatens one of the men with a knife to the throat, he sees Steven begging him to stop in its reflection.
He then flips into Steven and leaves the scene, with the men allowed to walk.
He blames Steven, but Steven denies causing the bloodshed, and we believe him.
Failing to get the gods on side, Marc is forced to find another way to move forwards.

     Moon Knight Episode 3 reveals one huge problem for Marvel's Daredevil revival
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The studio president even said that Moon Knight’s violence was evidence of the “boundaries shifting on what we’re able to do” in Marvel’s Disney+ shows.
In its first episode, Moon Knight used Marc Spector’s (Oscar Isaac) dissociative identity disorder to cut around his moments of violence, showing only the aftermath of his brawls.
Marc Spector (Oscar Isaac) makes a break for it in Moon Knight Episode 2.
That certainly seems like that would be the case, and odds are that Marvel’s Netflix fans wouldn’t be too happy about that.
Oscar Isaac as Steven Grant/Marc Spector in Moon Knight Episode 2.

     Moon Knight Teases Marc Spector's Dark Secret in Episode 3 — Grade It!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steven (and Marc) and Layla’s Egyptian excursion takes a troubling turn — several, actually — in Episode 3 of Marvel’s Moon Knight.
Increasingly desperate and seemingly out of options, Marc asks Khonshu why the other gods aren’t getting involved in Amit-gate.
Layla takes Marc to meet notorious “collector” Anton Mogart, played by the late Gaspard Ulliel, who becomes suspicious when Marc seems not to know very much about the sarcophagus.
As soon as things calm down (relatively speaking), Layla presses Marc to explain what Arthur was saying about her father.
“Steven, when the gods imprison me, tell Marc to free me,” the god tells him before they work together to reverse the stars.

     'Moon Knight' Episode 3 Hits Its Stride as It Embraces Its Mystical Roots | Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If there was any doubt that Moon Knight was going to shy away from its magical, mystical roots as laid out by Marvel Comics, Episode 3 of the Phase Four show has quickly dashed those thoughts from our heads.
And it’s in that universe that Marc and Steven, two alters living in the same body, must learn to cooperate.
The ensuing battle, in which we finally get our first taste of what Marc is capable of in the Moon Knight garb, turns one man into a veritable army against Mogart’s men.
Will he have to rely on learning to cooperate with Steven to stop Harrow once and for all?
Rating: A-The first three episodes of Moon Knight are streaming now on Disney+.

     ‘Moon Knight’ Episode 3 Recap: Moving Heaven and Earth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moon Knight has yet to directly address Marc’s dissociative identity disorder, opting instead to use it as a storytelling device to accentuate the mysterious, often dreamlike nature of the series.
The Midnight ManArthur Harrow isn’t the only obscure villain that Moon Knight is digging up for the title character’s live-action debut, as “The Friendly Type” introduces Anton Mogart.
Introduced as early as Moon Knight no.
As Marvel Studios showcased in a recent featurette, the Moon Knight team has done their homework on ancient Egypt, and they have purportedly made its historical accuracy a priority in the show’s world-building.
With the series headed to Ammit’s tomb next week, the best of Moon Knight may be yet to come.

     Summary: Moon Knight Episode 3 Season 1 Episode 3 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Courtesy of Marvel studiosMen will literally serve an Egyptian god as their avatar on Earth instead of going to therapy.
Marc has a single goal in the third episode of Moon Knight that, lucky for us, makes for a bracing, streamlined hour of television: find Ammit’s tomb before Arthur Harrow.
Didn’t we hear something in the previous episode about Marc Spector murdering a team of archaeologists at a dig site?
It works, but it means Layla, Marc, Steven, and whoever else will have to find Arthur and stop him without the help of Khonshu’s powers or the Moon Knight suit.
In the first episode, Steven pointed out to his boss that there are nine members of the Ennead, and only five appeared on the poster for the museum’s Ennead exhibit.
