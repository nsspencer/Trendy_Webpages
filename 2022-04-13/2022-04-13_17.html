     Archie Eversole, Atlanta rapper whose ‘We Ready’ may be ‘greatest game day anthem ever’ has died: reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Maybe you don’t know Archie Eversole, but if you attend sporting contests, even casually, there is a solid chance you know his voice.
And that’s because Eversole’s 2002 hit, “We Ready,” might just be the single, greatest pre-game hype track ever.
Sadly, Eversole, the man who delivered that classic, passed away on Wednesday, according to multiple reports.
Eversole was just 17 when he dropped his debut album, “Ride Wit Me Dirty South Style,” back in 2002.
“The man who gave us ‘We Ready,’ the greatest Game Day anthem ever, has passed away at 37-years-old,” former Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Robert Griffin III tweeted.
