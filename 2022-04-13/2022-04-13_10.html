    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Let’s start with the unsuccessful risk, which came when the game was tied at 1 in the seventh inning.
Siri was on first base with one out, and he seemed ready to run.
On a 1-2 pitch from D-backs right-hander J.B. Wendelken, Siri broke for second.
But the throw from catcher Jose Herrera arrived well ahead of Siri, who never made it to the bag and could not evade the tag.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the revised schedule came out it looked pretty daunting for the Astros to start the season with nine games on the road, seven against tough division opponents.
At this point, the Astros are 4-1 and with a win today they assure themselves two series wins and at least a winning record on the road trip.
Of course, we’d love to see the Astros sweep the Mariners in their home-opening series, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
Today it’s Framber Valdez against Houstonian Merrill Kelly.
Could this be the year he gets the vaunted status of true “ace?”Here are the lineups.

     Amazon’s cashierless Just Walk Out technology comes to Houston Astros’ Major League Baseball Stadium – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon announced today it will bring its cashier-free checkout technology, Just Walk Out, to a Major League Baseball stadium for the first time.
MLB team Houston Astros will introduce the Just Walk Out system to two stores at Minute Maid Park, allowing fans to purchase food and beverages.
With the addition of these two baseball stadium stores, Amazon continues to expand their cashier-less technology, which is available in Amazon Go and Fresh locations.
Only days ago, Amazon announced it opened another Fresh grocery store in greater Washington, D.C. that came equipped with Just Walk Out technology.
This followed other Fresh store openings this year including those in Moorpark, California; Naperville, Illinois; and Seattle, Washington, which also featured the technology.

     D-backs Game Preview, #6: 4/12 vs. Astros
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You don’t need me to tell you how absolutely wretched the D-backs offense has been.
The weird thing is, the D-backs have been showing great patience and plate discipline.
Their walk rate is 14%, easily the BEST in the majors, and more than half as much again above MLB average (9.3%).
But with that and reasonable power (their HR% of 2.9% is also above league average), the D-backs’ overall offensive production barely cracks the top 10 worst by sOPS+ i.e.
They have just three hits with RISP so far, in 22 at-bats, and their plate discipline also vanishes, with a K:BB of 7:1.

     Summary: The Astros and Diamondbacks authored an affront to situational baseball Wednesday, a lingering consequence of a shortened spring training.
The two offenses teamed to strand 21 baserunners and finish 1-for-19 with runners in scoring position during the first nine innings.
Placing an automatic runner in scoring position in the 10th did not cure every ill.
The D-Backs scored twice off closer Ryan Pressly in the 10th inning and defeated the Astros 3-2 on Wednesday afternoon.
They had nine at-bats with runners in scoring position Wednesday and managed one hit.

     Summary: Ryan Pressly handled the bottom of the ninth for his third save, working around a leadoff single by Seth Beer.
But that was the only big hit for Arizona's struggling offense, which is batting just .130 through five games.
Ellis had one hit in eight at-bats and struck out four times in the season-opening series against the Padres.
UP NEXTThe Astros and Diamondbacks wrap up their two-game series with a day game Wednesday.
The Diamondbacks will send RHP Merrill Kelly (0-0, 0.00 ERA) to the mound to face LHP Framber Valdez (1-0, 0.00).

     Summary: HOUSTON, TX – The Astros have collaborated with Amazon to equip two food and beverage stores at Minute Maid Park with Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology, providing fans a faster and easier shopping experience during the 2022 Major League Baseball season and beyond.
The Just Walk Out technology-enabled ‘19th Hole’ store is located on the Concourse level behind Section 156, and the Just Walk Out technology-enabled ‘Market’ store is located on the Honda Club level behind Section 211.
Shopping at a location powered by Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology is designed to be an effortless experience.
Fans visiting the two Just Walk Out technology-enabled stores can insert their credit card at the entry gates to shop.
“The Astros are proud to collaborate with Amazon to bring their Just Walk Out shopping experience to Minute Maid Park in 2022,” said Marcel Braithwaite, Senior Vice President, Business Operations for the Astros.

     Summary: The Houston Astros have teamed up with Amazon to install Just Walk Out systems at two concession stores in Minute Maid Park.
The Astros' stadium is the first in Major League Baseball to adopt Just Walk Out, and they're using the same slightly modified system Amazon is offering to other retailers.
The tech uses computer vision and other forms of AI to track shoppers as they enter and take (or put back) items.
Amazon's own stores just rely on the company's Go mobile app instead of credit cards.
Amazon didn't mention whether or not other MLB teams would embrace the zero-checkout offering, but it won't be surprising if they (and other sports leagues) do.

Beer tied the game in the 10th inning with an RBI single, and Ketel Marte followed with a game-ending sacrifice fly to give the Diamondbacks a 3-2 win over the Houston Astros.
Michael Brantley was intentionally walked, and Alex Bregman's sacrifice fly brought home Peña for the 2-1 lead.
Plate umpire Jim Reynolds didn't see the ball hit Marte but a D-backs challenge confirmed the ball glanced off Marte's foot.
The Astros tied the game in the seventh when Martin Maldonado’s sacrifice fly brought home McCormick.
