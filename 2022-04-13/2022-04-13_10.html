     Risk it for the biscuit: Siri's big gamble pays off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Let’s start with the unsuccessful risk, which came when the game was tied at 1 in the seventh inning.
Siri was on first base with one out, and he seemed ready to run.
On a 1-2 pitch from D-backs right-hander J.B. Wendelken, Siri broke for second.
But the throw from catcher Jose Herrera arrived well ahead of Siri, who never made it to the bag and could not evade the tag.

     D-backs Game Preview, #6: 4/12 vs. Astros
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You don’t need me to tell you how absolutely wretched the D-backs offense has been.
The weird thing is, the D-backs have been showing great patience and plate discipline.
Their walk rate is 14%, easily the BEST in the majors, and more than half as much again above MLB average (9.3%).
But with that and reasonable power (their HR% of 2.9% is also above league average), the D-backs’ overall offensive production barely cracks the top 10 worst by sOPS+ i.e.
They have just three hits with RISP so far, in 22 at-bats, and their plate discipline also vanishes, with a K:BB of 7:1.

     D-Backs walk off Astros 3-2 in 10 innings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On a game that went wrong in many aspects for the Astros on Wednesday afternoon, they lost it 3-2 to the Arizona Diamondbacks.
A sac fly by Ketel Marté walked them off the field in the bottom of the 10th inning to split the two-game series in the desert.
The Astros figured it out to keep things close despite the pitching disaster, but they couldn’t hit.
One early run in the second inning put the D-Backs ahead in the score until the seventh when Houston scored on a sac fly by Martín Maldonado.
Then, in the 10th inning, the Astros scored for the second time via Alex Bregman’s sacrifice fly.

     Brantley's clutch hit in 9th lifts Astros over D-backs 2-1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ryan Pressly handled the bottom of the ninth for his third save, working around a leadoff single by Seth Beer.
But that was the only big hit for Arizona's struggling offense, which is batting just .130 through five games.
Ellis had one hit in eight at-bats and struck out four times in the season-opening series against the Padres.
UP NEXTThe Astros and Diamondbacks wrap up their two-game series with a day game Wednesday.
The Diamondbacks will send RHP Merrill Kelly (0-0, 0.00 ERA) to the mound to face LHP Framber Valdez (1-0, 0.00).

     Ketel Marte sacrifice fly in 10th boosts Diamondbacks past Astros
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It might just be the sixth game of the season but Arizona Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo says he's already "exhausted."
It managed just six hits, two more than it accounted for in Tuesday night's 2-1 loss to the same foe.
The Diamondbacks were the recipient of nine walks and three hit batters yet struggled to score, going just 1-for-13 with runners in scoring position.
"That was a grinding game," Lovullo said.
But it was a good win.

     Summary: Chas McCormick drops an easy fly ball in left field, allowing the Diamondbacks to notch the winning run in the 10th inning.
Beer tied the game in the 10th inning with an RBI single, and Ketel Marte followed with a game-ending sacrifice fly to give the Diamondbacks a 3-2 win over the Houston Astros.
Michael Brantley was intentionally walked, and Alex Bregman's sacrifice fly brought home Peña for the 2-1 lead.
Plate umpire Jim Reynolds didn't see the ball hit Marte but a D-backs challenge confirmed the ball glanced off Marte's foot.
The Astros tied the game in the seventh when Martin Maldonado’s sacrifice fly brought home McCormick.

He missed it entirely“Two weeks from now, he destroys that ball,” manager Dusty Baker said after his team’s 3-2 loss.
“I think this is our sixth game,” Altuve said.
Take away an eight-run inning during their second game of the season and the Astros have scored 16 runs in the 54 frames.
We had the right people in the game at the right position and everything, just a tough one to lose.”
