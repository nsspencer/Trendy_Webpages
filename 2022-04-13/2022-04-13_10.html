     Game 6 Thread. April 13, 2022, 2:40 CT. Astros @ Diamondbacks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the revised schedule came out it looked pretty daunting for the Astros to start the season with nine games on the road, seven against tough division opponents.
At this point, the Astros are 4-1 and with a win today they assure themselves two series wins and at least a winning record on the road trip.
Of course, we’d love to see the Astros sweep the Mariners in their home-opening series, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
Today it’s Framber Valdez against Houstonian Merrill Kelly.
Could this be the year he gets the vaunted status of true “ace?”Here are the lineups.

     Risk it for the biscuit: Siri's big gamble pays off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Let’s start with the unsuccessful risk, which came when the game was tied at 1 in the seventh inning.
Siri was on first base with one out, and he seemed ready to run.
On a 1-2 pitch from D-backs right-hander J.B. Wendelken, Siri broke for second.
But the throw from catcher Jose Herrera arrived well ahead of Siri, who never made it to the bag and could not evade the tag.

     Brantley's clutch hit in 9th lifts Astros over D-backs 2-1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ryan Pressly handled the bottom of the ninth for his third save, working around a leadoff single by Seth Beer.
But that was the only big hit for Arizona's struggling offense, which is batting just .130 through five games.
Ellis had one hit in eight at-bats and struck out four times in the season-opening series against the Padres.
UP NEXTThe Astros and Diamondbacks wrap up their two-game series with a day game Wednesday.
The Diamondbacks will send RHP Merrill Kelly (0-0, 0.00 ERA) to the mound to face LHP Framber Valdez (1-0, 0.00).

     D-backs Game Preview, #6: 4/12 vs. Astros
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You don’t need me to tell you how absolutely wretched the D-backs offense has been.
The weird thing is, the D-backs have been showing great patience and plate discipline.
Their walk rate is 14%, easily the BEST in the majors, and more than half as much again above MLB average (9.3%).
But with that and reasonable power (their HR% of 2.9% is also above league average), the D-backs’ overall offensive production barely cracks the top 10 worst by sOPS+ i.e.
They have just three hits with RISP so far, in 22 at-bats, and their plate discipline also vanishes, with a K:BB of 7:1.

     Summary: Chas McCormick drops an easy fly ball in left field, allowing the Diamondbacks to notch the winning run in the 10th inning.
Beer tied the game in the 10th inning with an RBI single, and Ketel Marte followed with a game-ending sacrifice fly to give the Diamondbacks a 3-2 win over the Houston Astros.
Michael Brantley was intentionally walked, and Alex Bregman's sacrifice fly brought home Peña for the 2-1 lead.
Plate umpire Jim Reynolds didn't see the ball hit Marte but a D-backs challenge confirmed the ball glanced off Marte's foot.
The Astros tied the game in the seventh when Martin Maldonado’s sacrifice fly brought home McCormick.

     Summary: The Astros and Diamondbacks authored an affront to situational baseball, stranding 21 baserunners with a 1-for-19 showing with runners in scoring position.
He missed it entirely“Two weeks from now, he destroys that ball,” manager Dusty Baker said after his team’s 3-2 loss.
“I think this is our sixth game,” Altuve said.
Take away an eight-run inning during their second game of the season and the Astros have scored 16 runs in the 54 frames.
We had the right people in the game at the right position and everything, just a tough one to lose.”
