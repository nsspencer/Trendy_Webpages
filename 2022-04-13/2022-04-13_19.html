    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Summary Ukraine says ship damaged in missile strikeAll crew evacuated - InterfaxMoskva missile cruiser usually has crew of 500April 14 (Reuters) - The flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva missile cruiser, was badly damaged when ammunition on board blew up, Interfax news agency quoted the defence ministry as saying on Thursday.
"As the result of a fire on the Moskva missile cruiser, ammunition detonated.
In April 2021, the agency quoted a retired Russian admiral as saying "this is the most serious ship in the Black Sea".
"It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where the border guards on Snake Island told it to go," he said in an online post.
Last month Ukraine said it had destroyed a large Russian landing support ship, the Orsk, on the smaller Sea of Azov to the northeast of the Black Sea.

     Russia: Major Black Sea fleet ship damaged in blast after Ukraine claimed strike
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed Wednesday that its Moskva missile cruiser was badly damaged in a fire — hours after Ukrainian forces claimed they'd struck the vessel in the Black Sea.
Why it matters: The Moskva is the most essential ship in the Russian Black Sea fleet, with cruise missiles that have a range of at least 440 miles, per Reuters.
Maksym Marchenko claimed in a Telegram post hours earlier that Ukrainian missiles "guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage to the Russian ship."
Flashback: The Moskva was the warship that reportedly told Ukrainian border guards to surrender Snake Island, off Ukraine's coast in the Black Sea.
Editor's note: This article has been updated with more comment from the Russian Defense Ministry, remarks by Zelensky and further context.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday, 13 April, the Russian military reported that one of its largest warships, the Moskva Project 1164 missile cruiser, suffered “severe damage” after ammunition exploded onboard.
The Moskva is the largest warship in Russia’s Black Sea fleet, and the incident could form a pivotal moment in the conflict.
All Russian reports have yet to acknowledge any mention of a Ukrainian strike causing the large fire on board.

     Ukraine war: Russia admits Black Sea flagship in flames as Ukraine claims missile attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There has been a fire on board the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, Moscow has admitted, with Ukraine claiming to have hit it with anti-ship missiles.
Russia's defence ministry said the Moskva missile cruiser had been badly damaged after ammunition on board was blown up in the flames.
"As a result of a fire on the Moskva missile cruiser, ammunition detonated," it said in comments reported by the Tass news agency.
At first it was thought the Ukrainian soldiers had been killed but the country's navy later said they had been captured alive by Russia.
Ukrainian soldiers trying to defend the strategically-important city have been fighting for weeks while running out of food, water, and ammunition.

     Summary: A satellite image shows a view of Russian Navy's guided missile cruiser Moskva at port, in Sevastopol, Crimea, April 7, 2022.
The flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet was seriously damaged and its crew evacuated on Thursday, following an explosion on board that Ukraine said was caused by a missile strike.
Maksym Marchenko, the Ukrainian governor of the region around the Black Sea port of Odesa, said the Moskva had been hit by two Ukrainian-made Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles.
"Neptune missiles guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage," he said in an online post.
Andriy Nyebytov, head of the Kyiv region police, said more than 800 bodies had been found in three districts which had been occupied by Russian forces.

     One Of Russia’s Biggest Cruisers Just Sank Near Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo via Wikimedia CommonsA Ukrainian navy missile battery reportedly has struck the Russian navy cruiser Moskva off the coast of Odessa, a strategic port city on the Black Sea in southwest Ukraine.
“Neptune missiles … caused very serious damage to the Russian ship,” Marchenko said.
But the pre-war Ukrainian navy probably possessed just one Neptune battery out of the half-dozen or so it planned to induct this spring.
A Neptune battery includes a truck-mounted launcher with four rounds, a command truck and a pair of resupply trucks plus links to a mobile Mineral-U radar with a 370-mile range.
Those defenses—mines, anti-tank missiles, long-range ballistic missiles and armed drones—make any amphibious operation against a Ukrainian port extremely risky for the attackers.
