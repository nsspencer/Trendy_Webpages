     Russia: Major Black Sea fleet ship damaged in blast after Ukraine claimed strike
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed Wednesday that its Moskva missile cruiser was badly damaged in a fire — hours after Ukrainian forces claimed they'd struck the vessel in the Black Sea.
Why it matters: The Moskva is the most essential ship in the Russian Black Sea fleet, with cruise missiles that have a range of at least 440 miles, per Reuters.
Maksym Marchenko claimed in a Telegram post hours earlier that Ukrainian missiles "guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage to the Russian ship."
Flashback: The Moskva was the warship that reportedly told Ukrainian border guards to surrender Snake Island, off Ukraine's coast in the Black Sea.
Editor's note: This article has been updated with more comment from the Russian Defense Ministry, remarks by Zelensky and further context.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Summary Ukraine says ship damaged in missile strikeAll crew evacuated - InterfaxMoskva missile cruiser usually has crew of 500April 14 (Reuters) - The flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva missile cruiser, was badly damaged when ammunition on board blew up, Interfax news agency quoted the defence ministry as saying on Thursday.
"As the result of a fire on the Moskva missile cruiser, ammunition detonated.
In April 2021, the agency quoted a retired Russian admiral as saying "this is the most serious ship in the Black Sea".
"It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where the border guards on Snake Island told it to go," he said in an online post.
Last month Ukraine said it had destroyed a large Russian landing support ship, the Orsk, on the smaller Sea of Azov to the northeast of the Black Sea.

     Moskva: Russian warship involved in Snake Island attack burns ‘after missile strike’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet was “seriously damaged” on Thursday after an explosion that Ukrainian officials claimed was due to their missile strike.
The Moskva cruiser is a 12,000-ton, Soviet-era, heavily modernised guided missile cruiser.
The Russian defence ministry, according to state media, said ammunition detonated as a result of a fire on the Moskva missile cruiser.
“The Neptune missiles guarding the Black Sea inflicted very serious damage on the Russian ship.
This is the same ship that was involved in a standoff in the remote Snake island in the early days of the war.

     One Of Russia’s Biggest Cruisers Just Sank Near Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo via Wikimedia CommonsA Ukrainian navy missile battery reportedly has struck the Russian navy cruiser Moskva off the coast of Odessa, a strategic port city on the Black Sea in southwest Ukraine.
“Neptune missiles … caused very serious damage to the Russian ship,” Marchenko said.
But the pre-war Ukrainian navy probably possessed just one Neptune battery out of the half-dozen or so it planned to induct this spring.
A Neptune battery includes a truck-mounted launcher with four rounds, a command truck and a pair of resupply trucks plus links to a mobile Mineral-U radar with a 370-mile range.
Those defenses—mines, anti-tank missiles, long-range ballistic missiles and armed drones—make any amphibious operation against a Ukrainian port extremely risky for the attackers.
