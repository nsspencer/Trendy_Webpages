     Blue Sky Studios Gives Scrat a Proper Sendoff in Final Farewell
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has somehow been 20 years since audiences first witnessed the adventures of Manny, Sid, Diego, and all the rest of the Ice Age crew.
Blue Sky Studios is the team behind Ice Age, but it has gone extinct thanks to the recent megamerger of Disney and 20th Century Fox.
As a brief goodbye from the artists that brought this franchise to life, Blue Sky posted a brief animation of the popular squirrel finally securing the acorn and eating it.
The description of the video is far from the tone of Blue Sky’s films, reading as a final message that wouldn’t otherwise get out.
“In the final days of Blue Sky Studios, a small team of artists came together to do one final shot.

     Summary: Following their closure by Disney, the staff at Blue Sky Studios have snuck out one final piece of work, one year later.
Disney, not really needing another animation studio, simply shut Blue Sky down after a couple of decades in operation.
Just over a year since Blue Sky Studios closed its doors for the final time, and a clip has just been posted on an unnamed YouTube account.
The unlisted clip comes with a description that reads ‘In the final days of Blue Sky Studios, a small team of artists came together to do one final shot.
Here then is the final work of the Blue Sky team in its original form…—Thank you for visiting!
