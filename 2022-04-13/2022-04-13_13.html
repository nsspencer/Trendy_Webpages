     2 Trade Packages To Send Zion Williamson To New York Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zion Williamson to the New York Knicks has always felt preordained since before he stepped foot on an NBA court.
When the lottery order was announced in 2019, Knicks fans nearly rioted.
Unlike Williamson, he‚Äôs at least been able to stay there.
A slew of injuries has left Zion on the injury report more often than he‚Äôs been in the starting lineup.
If a formal trade demand comes, the Pelicans may be forced to oblige it.

     Zion Williamson Wouldn‚Äôt Be Ready For First-Round Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pelicans won‚Äôt have Zion Williamson available if they advance to Friday‚Äôs play-in game or even a first-round series against the Suns, the team told Cassidy Hubbarth of ESPN (hat tip to Real GM).
Williamson hasn‚Äôt been ruled out for the season, but a Pelicans spokesperson informed Hubbarth that ‚Äúa return to play is not imminent.‚ÄùWilliamson, who hasn‚Äôt played since having offseason surgery on a fracture in his right foot, raised some eyebrows with a 360 dunk during warm-ups before tonight‚Äôs game (video link).
Although he looked as explosive as ever, the Pelicans don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs ready for game action.
1 pick in the 2019 draft has advanced to the point in rehab where he can participate in controlled scrimmages with teammates and assistant coaches.
There has been hope among Pelicans fans that he could return to boost the team‚Äôs playoff chances, but tonight‚Äôs report makes that seem unlikely unless New Orleans can somehow win a series or two.

     Summary: Zion Williamson‚Äôs recovery from a right foot injury has improved to the point where he‚Äôs been participating in controlled scrimmages with assistant coaches and players.
Williamson has not appeared in game this season and was ruled out for the Pelicans‚Äô Play-In game against the Spurs, though he stole the show during warmups.
1 pick looked as explosive as ever while throwing down a pair of windmill dunks, including a vicious 360.
Video of Williamson‚Äô workout quickly became a hot topic on Twitter, as well as ESPN‚Äôs halftime show during the Hawks-Hornets Play-In game.
Williamson broke the fifth metacarpal in his right foot during a preseason workout last summer.

     Summary: Ever since the start of the 2022 season, Zion Williamson has been out with a foot injury.
Over the course of time, analysts showed their concerns as the Pelicans forward put on staggering weight.
However, it seems like Williamson is getting back on track as he pulled off an insane 360 dunk during practice.
While many wrote out Zion from having a long career, the Pelicans forward is trying to flip the script.

     Summary: The Impending Divorce Of The Still Excellent Jazz by John Wilmes Utah's division of labor has worked pretty well on paper, but the human toll is increasingly seen, and the basketball ecosystem in Salt Lake City appears to be crumbling despite still functioning at a very high level.
The Sheer Lovability Of Jose Alvarado by John Wilmes Jose Alvarado's measurable impact on the floor may be only marginally positive for the Pelicans, but his presence signifies something more important, which is that good, unexpected basketball things can actually happen in New Orleans.
