     WATCH: Zion Williamson Does 360 Dunk Before Pelicans-Spurs Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Pelicans hosted the San Antonio Spurs for the play-in tournament on Wednesday evening, and before the game Zion Williamson was spotted doing a 360 dunk (in a video shared by the NBA and then Bleacher Report).
Williamson has yet to play in a game so far this season, but that kind of play should be a promising sign for fans that he is getting back to full strength.
The winner of Wednesday's game will head to California to play the Los Angeles Clippers for a chance at the eighth seed in the Western Conference.

     Clippers to host Pelicans for elimination play-in game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Clippers will host the New Orleans Pelicans for a win-or-go-home play-in game on Friday, April 15.
The Pelicans beat the San Antonio Spurs 113-103 on Wednesday to advance in the play-in tournament.
Unlike the Clippers, the Pelicans will go into Friday’s game with a win fresh in their memory.
It’s not just that the Clippers lost, though; it’s that by the end of Tuesday’s game, they looked absolutely gassed.
The Clippers and Pelicans will tip-off at 7 p.m. PT on Friday and the game will be nationally broadcast on TNT.

     Pelicans attack the rim, start hot then hold on late to beat Spurs, advance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On April 13, 2022, the Pelicans moved within one win of the playoffs.
Stars’ value goes up in the playoffs — or play-in games — and the Pelicans’ had more star power, and those stars stepped up.
McCollum and Ingram drove the rim hard, and Jonas Valanciunas was a force in the paint finishing with 22 points and 14 rebounds.
The key was the Pelicans made their shots inside, shooting 65.1% in the paint for the game (and getting Dejounte Murray and other Spurs in foul trouble).
But when they had to in the clutch, the Pelicans got some stops and Ingram got some buckets.

     Summary: New Orleans Pelicans: 3 keys to beating the Spurs in the Play-in by George HathawayThe Pelicans will take on the San Antonio Spurs in what will hopefully be the first game of the NBA play-in tournament for New Orleans.
If the Pels win, they will go on to face the Los Angeles Clippers, who lost to the Timberwolves.
He has logged two triple-doubles against the Pelicans this season and had 31 points and 12 assists in a Spurs’ win back in February.
Offensively the Pelicans just have to do their thing, be patient and use their experience against the young Spurs.

     Pelicans vs. Spurs score, takeaways: CJ McCollum, Brandon Ingram lead New Orleans to showdown with Clippers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CJ McCollum finished the win with a game-high 32 points, seven assists and six rebounds while Brandon Ingram and Jonas Valanciunas both eclipsed the 20-point plateau to lead the charge on the offensive end for New Orleans.
With the win, New Orleans advances to face the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night in an elimination game for the right to be the No.
Pelicans bucket-gettersThe playoffs often come down to individual shot-making, and the Pelicans have two of the best in the biz with CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram.
On Wednesday, Ingram did a lot of his damage heading toward the rim and getting to the foul line early, then McCollum went to work, displaying a seemingly unending array of step-backs and stutter steps.
After the loss, Popovich was asked whether he'd return for his 27th season, and he answered in true Pop fashion.
