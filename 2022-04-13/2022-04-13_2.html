    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His City faced Real Madrid in the last 16 in 2020 and won comfortably enough (4–2 on aggregate), pressing Zinedine Zidane’s side into errors.
German referee Daniel Siebert had been curiously lax throughout, allowing Atlético’s gamesmanship and intimidation, but as City largely maintained its discipline, Atlético’s antics eventually backfired.
City had roughly two-thirds of the ball and, without overcommitting, did pose a consistent threat in the first half.
Atlético went direct and pressed hard and for a time, as the atmosphere swelled, City looked rattled.
It drew 3–3 on the day for a 6–4 aggregate win to set up a semifinal against Villarreal, another England-Spain showdown.

     Man City see off Atletico in fiery clash to reach semi-finals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The trouble began on the pitch, as Atletico defender Felipe sparked a huge brawl in the corner after a taking a wild swipe at City's Phil Foden.
But City survived the early, physical onslaught and established control, even if Atletico looked a threat on the break, failing only with their final pass.
De Paul's first touch was to fire just past the post and City were retreating now, camped in their own half, accepting or unable to prevent the Atletico pressure.
A swarm of players, substitutes and staff rushed in and it was only a few minutes later that Felipe was sent off.
With nine minutes of added time, Gundogan should have settled it for City but Atleti survived.
