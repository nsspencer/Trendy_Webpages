Veterans of the Game Thread know how we do things around here, but for all you newbies we have a few rules.
The Spurs have had pretty good success this season against the Pelicans, winning 3 out of the 4 matchups, including both games in New Orleans.
Jaxson Hayes gives the Pelicans a lot of size in their frontcourt, so Pop might counter with Jock Landale as necessary.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW ORLEANS (AP) — CJ McCollum got New Orleans going early and Brandon Ingram took over late to send the Pelicans to Los Angeles for a chance at the final playoff spot.
McCollum scored 27 of his 32 points in the first half to carry the young Pelicans to a 113-103 win over the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night.
“He was great,” Pelicans coach Willie Green said of McCollum.
“The playoffs is a lot of antics, a lot of momentum plays, a lot of back and forth.
I ain’t making no excuses.”After Ingram went to the bench with three fouls 5:17 before halftime, McCollum carried the Pelicans offensively.

     Pelicans vs. Spurs score, takeaways: CJ McCollum, Brandon Ingram lead New Orleans to showdown with Clippers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CJ McCollum finished the win with a game-high 32 points, seven assists and six rebounds while Brandon Ingram and Jonas Valanciunas both eclipsed the 20-point plateau to lead the charge on the offensive end for New Orleans.
With the win, New Orleans advances to face the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night in an elimination game for the right to be the No.
Pelicans bucket-gettersThe playoffs often come down to individual shot-making, and the Pelicans have two of the best in the biz with CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram.
On Wednesday, Ingram did a lot of his damage heading toward the rim and getting to the foul line early, then McCollum went to work, displaying a seemingly unending array of step-backs and stutter steps.
After the loss, Popovich was asked whether he'd return for his 27th season, and he answered in true Pop fashion.
