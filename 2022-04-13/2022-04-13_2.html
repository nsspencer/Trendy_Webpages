     Summary: Clayton Kershaw was perfect through seven innings.
The Dodgers manager would not let Kershaw go beyond the 80 pitches he threw Wednesday afternoon in Minneapolis during his first start of the season.
APAfter getting Jorge Polanco out, Vesia gave up a single to former Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez to end the perfect game and no-hit bid.
Felix Hernandez was the last pitcher to throw a perfect game, doing so for the Mariners on Aug. 15, 2012 against the Rays.
Roberts pulled Rich Hill from a perfect game after seven innings in 2016 due to blister concerns.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander and three-time Cy Young award winner tossed seven perfect innings Wednesday afternoon in a 7-0 Dodgers victory.
“I would have loved to have stayed, but bigger things, man, bigger things,” Kershaw said.
It was time.”Roberts faced a similar decision six years ago when he pulled starter Rich Hill after 89 pitches and seven perfect innings against the Miami Marlins.
That perfect game ended in the eighth -- just as this one did.
The last pitcher to toss a perfect game in the majors was Felix Hernandez of the Seattle Mariners, who did it in September 2012.

     Dodgers 7, Twins 0: Absolutely Imperfect Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He was up against less than ideal circumstances between just being traded, facing a deadly Dodgers lineup, and dealing with cold weather, and he did alright.
He’s the greatest pitcher of his generation and has accomplished everything he possibly could- besides a perfect game.
I won’t listen to any defense of the decision to yank him and deprive him of trying (the way he was dominating, succeeding) for the 24th perfect game in MLB history.
Alex Vesia entered for the Dodgers, and gave up the Twins’ only two baserunners, a single by Gary Sanchez and a walk of Max Kepler.
In the bottom of the 9th, the Twins went down without a whimper, and mercifully brought an end to this two-game series.

     Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw pulled after throwing 7 perfect innings: 'It was the right decision'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dodgers left-hander Clayton Kershaw pitched seven perfect innings at Minnesota on Wednesday before exiting in eighth inning.
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts pulled the 34-year-old before the bottom of the eighth inning with Kershaw at 80 pitches.
In that game, Kershaw struck out 15 batters, but his bid for a perfect game was busted when Colorado's Corey Dickerson reached first base on a throwing error by Hanley Ramirez in the seventh inning.
Dodgers teammates Cody Bellinger, Gavin Lux and Austin Barnes hit consecutive home runs in the eighth inning off Twins reliever Dereck Rodríguez, as Kershaw looked on with a smile.
Now in his 15th season, Kershaw is on a one-year, $17 million contract with the Dodgers.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Dodgers southpaw Clayton Kershaw was removed from a perfect game bid on Wednesday afternoon against the Minnesota Twins.
Vesia subsequently surrendered a single to Gary Sánchez, dashing any hopes Los Angeles had of making history.
"As much as I would have wanted to do it, I've thrown 75 pitches in a sim game," Kershaw told reporters.
The only perfect game in Dodgers history was thrown by Sandy Koufax in September 1965.
Major League Baseball's most recent perfect game occurred when former Seattle Mariners ace Félix Hernández hurled one on August 15, 2012 against the Tampa Bay Rays.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The last time Clayton Kershaw had pitched in a regular season game, it seemed like his Dodgers tenure was coming to an imperfect end.
In his first start since re-signing with the Dodgers this winter, Kershaw pitched seven perfect innings before being taken out of the game.
The Dodgers lost the combined perfect game bid an inning later, when Gary Sánchez singled against reliever Alex Vesia, but still went on to a 7-0 win against the Minnesota Twins.
Barely a month ago, Dodgers coaches were unsure if Kershaw would even be able to be part of the season-opening roster.
The 34-year-old didn’t have a perfect game, but had still completed an almost perfect day.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During his childhood in Orange County, when the future National League MVP was just a budding young player with a raw left-handed swing, there were only two people who ever gave Freddie Freeman hitting lessons.
It’s where Freeman matured as a young hitter, the place he unleashed his opposite-field power and crafted his consistent stroke at the plate.
Ira had already heard about Freeman, who was a Little League legend in the Orange County baseball community.
He filmed many of Freeman’s reps too, reviewing the tape with Freeman later as they dissected his progress.
A few days later, Freeman started feeling confident again — the student and instructor falling right back into their old rhythm.

Salvador Mota was taken to a hospital and treated for injuries after, a lawsuits says, he was beaten by Dodgers security personnel.
“He caused this, we didn’t cause it,” one man, who appears to be a security officer, can be heard saying in the video.
Karen Osorio’s face shows bruises and abrasions, the result, her attorney says, of an attack by Dodgers security.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers lineup scored just 11 runs over three games at Coors Field, and their inability to fully take advantage of opportunities played a part in dropping the Opening Series to the Colorado Rockies.
While recognizing a need to still find consistency, Freeman expressed confidence the Dodgers lineup collectively is rounding into form, via Bill Plunkett of the Southern California News Group:“Well, you know what it’s capable of,” Freddie Freeman said of the offense’s sporadic appearance this season.
… The gate’s about to open.”If there’s a silver lining for the Dodgers, their six-run eighth inning being built behind consecutive walks by Mookie Betts and Freeman.
Then on Wednesday, the Dodgers scored at least one run in four different innings to back seven perfect innings from Clayton Kershaw.
Taylor: Dodgers lineup ‘best in baseballChris Taylor was among those to note the Dodgers needed to improve their play after losing two of three to the Rockies, and in expressing that sentiment he referred to the team’s lineup as the “best in baseball.”Have you subscribed to the Dodger Blue YouTube channel?
