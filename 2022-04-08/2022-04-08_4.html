     Ambulance movie review &amp; film summary (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will Cam’s hostage experience—she’s the EMT in Danny and Will’s stolen ambulance, if you haven’t yet put that together—reignite her passion for saving lives?
Danny is behind the wheel, mowing down traffic cones and speeding the wrong way up highway overpasses at 60 mph.
In short, “Ambulance” is all peak and no valley, a breathless roller coaster ride that’s made all the more discombobulating by Bay’s hyper-kinetic shooting style.
And the flaming cop cars flying in all directions, including directly towards the camera, don’t help the legibility issue.
The movie looks like it cost more than its $40 million budget, thanks to the sheer volume of flaming destruction on screen.

     Michael Bay says he saved money on Ambulance by sweet-talking the police
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But with a budget of just $40 million, his latest film, Ambulance, is a little more down-to-earth than his five Transformers movies, or even his Netflix project, 6 Underground.
Bay made the most of his slightly smaller budget, and Ambulance is still full of shootouts, explosions, car chases, and action.
This was just the regular escort crew assigned to the film, Bay explains, but it was also an opportunity.
What if you’re chasing an ambulance?’” Bay said.
It looks real because it is on a real freeway, and we are going that fast.

     Review: Hard to deny escapist panache of 'Ambulance'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The robbery fails to go according to its hurried and haphazard plan, and, like in Michael Mann’s “Heat,” a bank-job-gone-wrong spills out onto downtown Los Angeles streets.
And while Bay’s film wouldn’t stand up to too much inquiry — this is a movie where a ruptured spleen is treated with a hairpin — it’s hard to deny its escapist panache.
Next to films like “Armageddon” and the “Transformers” movies, “Ambulance” was made for a surprisingly modest $40 million.
Maybe the film’s most unbelievable aspect is how empty of traffic the Los Angeles streets are.
When the injured cop in the ambulance goes into critical condition, Will donates blood while the chase continues.

     Ambulance: Wrong-headed and excessive movie remake
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bay is the blockbuster auteur (yes, he’s something of an original) responsible for some of movie history's biggest box office successes.
“Ambulance” is an adaptation of a well-received 2005 Danish film that ran an efficient 80 minutes (including credits!).
“Ambulance” tries to take the shocking shoot-out sequence from Michael Mann’s “Heat” and stretch it out over a feature running time.
And the story attempts to make us care about Will’s impossible situation while somehow justifying his recklessness.
Dated and excessive, “Ambulance” marks a low point for director Michael Bay, who desperately needs a career overhaul.

     Review: Can Michael Bay save the blockbuster? Nutso ‘Ambulance’ is his best in decades
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just to watch this deliriously dumb actioner is an amber-threat-level event best avoided by those with pacemakers or PhDs; imagine actually making it.
Probably wise that it is set in the titular emergency response vehicle, ensuring easy access during shooting to defibrilllators and tongue depressors.
Because the issue of Bay continuing in the rudest of health is not merely idle chit-chat.
Mr. Bay, please get your thyroid checked out, because apparently, we need you.
Less care was taken beefing up the screenplay (adapted by Chris Fedak), but one hardly comes to a Michael Bay movie for the Wildean wordplay.
