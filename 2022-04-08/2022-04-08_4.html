     Michael Bay says he saved money on Ambulance by sweet-talking the police
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But with a budget of just $40 million, his latest film, Ambulance, is a little more down-to-earth than his five Transformers movies, or even his Netflix project, 6 Underground.
Bay made the most of his slightly smaller budget, and Ambulance is still full of shootouts, explosions, car chases, and action.
This was just the regular escort crew assigned to the film, Bay explains, but it was also an opportunity.
What if you’re chasing an ambulance?’” Bay said.
It looks real because it is on a real freeway, and we are going that fast.

     Review: Hard to deny escapist panache of 'Ambulance'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The robbery fails to go according to its hurried and haphazard plan, and, like in Michael Mann’s “Heat,” a bank-job-gone-wrong spills out onto downtown Los Angeles streets.
And while Bay’s film wouldn’t stand up to too much inquiry — this is a movie where a ruptured spleen is treated with a hairpin — it’s hard to deny its escapist panache.
Next to films like “Armageddon” and the “Transformers” movies, “Ambulance” was made for a surprisingly modest $40 million.
Maybe the film’s most unbelievable aspect is how empty of traffic the Los Angeles streets are.
When the injured cop in the ambulance goes into critical condition, Will donates blood while the chase continues.

     ‘Ambulance’ Review: Jake Gyllenhaal And Cast Try To Survive Michael Bay’s Dizzying And Exhausting L.A. Freeway Chase Flick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In The Guilty, Gyllenhaal was manning an emergency call center and all the action took place there, a kind of one-man show.
Of course this is manna from heaven for the likes of Bay (Transformers, The Rock, Armageddon, Bad Boys, etc.)
Somehow with instructions via Zoom, Thompson must also perform complicated emergency surgery on the cop with hte chase and shootouts in progress.
The rest of the movie rarely slows down to breathe as it all comes crashing towards its conclusion after an exhausting runtime.
The fault is not in our stars, and quite frankly if all you want is a freeway chase, this one delivers on that score.

     Review: Can Michael Bay save the blockbuster? Nutso ‘Ambulance’ is his best in decades
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just to watch this deliriously dumb actioner is an amber-threat-level event best avoided by those with pacemakers or PhDs; imagine actually making it.
Probably wise that it is set in the titular emergency response vehicle, ensuring easy access during shooting to defibrilllators and tongue depressors.
Because the issue of Bay continuing in the rudest of health is not merely idle chit-chat.
Mr. Bay, please get your thyroid checked out, because apparently, we need you.
Less care was taken beefing up the screenplay (adapted by Chris Fedak), but one hardly comes to a Michael Bay movie for the Wildean wordplay.

And ensues, and ensues, and ensues.
(The basic notion is that the cops won’t kill the hijackers as long as one of their own is still alive in the ambulance.
