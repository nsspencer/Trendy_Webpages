     Dodgers: Longtime LA GM Officially Retires from Baseball
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former general manager Ned Colletti is no exception.
Colletti served as the Dodgers general manager from late 2005 to late 2014.
However, he might be best known for another big trade with Boston.
Yesterday, the former general manager announced that he is officially stepping away from the sport of baseball in a professional capacity.
As the adage goes, sometimes the best moves general managers make is the moves they don't make.

     Summary: Dodgers manager Dave Roberts doesn't need to convince himself.
During spring training, Roberts guaranteed that LA would win it all.
After acquiring Freddie Freeman this offseason, there's already plenty of pressure on the Dodgers to win it all.
Roberts and the Dodgers do boast a strong recent track record of playoff success.
They've played in four of last five NLCS and three of the last five World Series.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dodgers wanted the left-hander to get as built up as possible for his first start of the year.
Before this season, Kershaw had been the Dodgers opening day starter every year when healthy since 2011.
Roberts, however, believes having Kershaw pitch the fifth game will be best for the pitcher and the team.
That’s the thought behind it.”Kershaw being healthy to start the season has been a pleasant surprise for the Dodgers.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Freddie Freeman in his first starting lineup with the Dodgers bats second, a role he’s become more accustomed to in the last two years.
Freeman starts at first base against the Rockies on Friday afternoon at Coors Field in Denver.
In 2021, Freeman went back to batting third until leadoff man Ronald Acuña Jr. got hurt, then shifted back to second.
This spring with the Dodgers, Freeman batted second in eight of his nine games, putting a left-handed bat between right-handers Mookie Betts at leadoff and Trea Turner batting third.
This is the seventh opening day start for Justin Turner, whose first game with the Dodgers in 2014 was a start at second base in Sydney, Australia.

Given the way last year played out, it’s easy to understand why the Dodgers are approaching the season that way.
Last season I thought the Dodgers would win the division easily.
But despite the questions, their offense and bullpen will be enough to win the division.
How many games will the Dodgers win this season?
