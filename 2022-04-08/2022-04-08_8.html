     Summary: When asked if he wanted to start for the Giants on Opening Day, Logan Webb couldn't say yes any quicker.
"[Giants pitching coach Andrew Bailey] and [Gabe Kapler] brought me in, they just kind of asked, 'Hey, do you want to start Opening Day?'
"I'm super excited.
After a shaky start to his 2021 season, Webb caught fire in the second half, finishing the season as the Giants' ace.

     What's that thing on Joey Bart's arm? An explainer on how the SF Giants are using PitchCom on Opening Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants are one of the reportedly-about-half of MLB squads that will be trying out a device known as PitchCom.
Prior to this, the Giants’ new starting catcher, Joey Bart, would have used his fingers to signal what pitch he wanted Opening Day starter Logan Webb to throw his way.
Instead, Bart will press one of the 81 combinations of buttons on the PitchCom device on his wrist to send that message to Webb.
The catcher said Thursday he intends to use the technology with nearly all of the Giants’ pitching staff.
This doesn’t change the fact that pitchers can still reject pitch suggestions with the famous shake of the head while on the mound, nor does it mean catchers can’t revert to finger signals if a pitcher spends a lot of time rejecting pitch suggestions.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO – Great starting pitching, power to all fields, suspect defense and baserunning, some up-and-down performances by the bullpen, and a player brought in on a boat.
The Giants experienced it all Friday on a picturesque Opening Day at Oracle Park.
Brandon Belt also homered, as his shot to right in the eighth inning traveled 376 feet and gave San Francisco a 4-2 lead.
With Belt on second base, Ruf then singled to right to put San Francisco up 2-0.
Belt made an unforgettable entrance to Oracle Park – one only a self-proclaimed captain can make – as part of the Giants’ elaborate Opening Day festivities.

     SF Giants injury update: La Stella, Longoria, Wade detail recovery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: La Stella and the Giants discussed carrying him as a designated hitter but decided to play it safe instead.
“It was always up in the air, so we understood this was a realistic possibility,” La Stella said.
But after a follow-up consultation last week with Dr. Robert Anderson, who performed the operation, La Stella isn’t concerned.
“There’s always scar tissue elements of this that there’s really nothing other than just breaking through it, and that can take time,” La Stella said.
Wade almost certainly would have found a spot in the Opening Day lineup against Marlins right-hander Sandy Alcantara but will be forced to watch from the dugout, alongside La Stella and Longoria.

That’s right: Belt bunt, Bart belt.

     Summary: In my first draft I focused on the Giants 25-year old Opening Day battery of Logan Webb and Joey Bart.
It ended up working out well for the 2021 Giants, so it made sense that the the 2022 Giants would follow the blueprint.
My third and hopefully final draft focuses on the fact that the Giants did everything in this game, good and bad.
Let’s talk about how Bart scored after his walk, which was the first run of the game for the Giants.
And congrats to the Giants and Marlins for eschewing Rob Manfred’s pathetic rule, and managing to end an extra-innings game without scoring a single ghost runner.

     SF Giants: Logan Webb realizes potential with Opening Day start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — When Logan Webb takes the mound Friday afternoon, at 25 years old, he’ll become the Giants’ youngest Opening Day starter in more than a decade, a homegrown product with a dozen family members in the stands.
Last year’s Opening Day starter, Kevin Gausman, served as the 2021 staff’s spiritual leader.
But last season, Webb reduced the walk rate to one every 4.1 innings while getting more strikeouts than he ever had before.
Webb had every right to presume that the Opening Day nod was his.
He’ll be the youngest Opening Day starter since Lincecum, at 24, in 2009.
