     Aaron Judge contract: Yankees GM Cashman confirms talks have ended
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Judge and the Yankees did not reach a contract extension agreement by their Opening Day deadline, Yankees general manager Brian Cashman confirmed on Friday.
The deal would have been a total of eight years, $233 million including this season, which Judge is already signed on for.
“Yeah, it’s concluded unfortunately we’ll be in a one-year setting yet to be determined number,” Cashman said.
Cashman noted that there are “no guarantees” that the Yankees and Judge will be able to agree on the $30.5 million previously proposed by the end of the season.
Our certainly hope is that at some point we’ll find that common ground that we both feel comfortable with.”More MLB Coverage:For more New York Yankees coverage, go to Inside The Pinstripes.

     Summary: Josh Donaldson comes through with a clutch, walk-off RBI single up the middle to give the Yankees a 6-5 win over the Red Sox.
(0:38)NEW YORK -- Yankees third baseman Josh Donaldson felt the pressure of coming into a new market and making a strong first impression.
"You gotta trust your process and how you go about your business."
The moment for Donaldson to really trust his process came in the bottom of the 11th inning against the rival Boston Red Sox on Opening Day with Isiah Kiner-Falefa on second base to start the inning.
"It's a good feeling to be in an environment where there's an expectation to win," Donaldson said.

     Summary: NEW YORK -- All-Star right fielder Aaron Judge and the New York Yankees did not come to an agreement on a contract extension ahead of the slugger's self-imposed deadline of Opening Day.
General manager Brian Cashman said the team offered a seven-year, $213.5 million extension, which, paired with the $17 million it offered in arbitration this season, would have made the entire package just over $230 million.
"We were unsuccessful in concluding a multiyear pact," Cashman said Friday before the Yankees' 6-5 season-opening win over the Boston Red Sox.
But it doesn't mean that a conclusion in a positive way for the Yankees and Aaron Judge together in the future can't happen.
I got one year to play, and contract extension stuff is nice, but I got bigger things to focus on."

     Summary: This Yankees’ offseason, literally to the final minutes before their 2022 opener Friday, played out as if the franchise were trying to see just how much it could dismay and disappoint its fan base.
In between Rizzo’s first-inning homer, with Judge aboard, and Donaldson’s winning single, the Yankees went 0-for-15 with men on base.
LeMahieu has as many top-four MVP finishes with the Yankees (two) as Judge does.
The non-loquacious LeMahieu described himself as “in a good place,” and if he is the Yankees offense upgrades.
This will be the opener when negotiations between Judge and the Yankees closed.

     Summary: NEW YORK -- The New York Yankees failed to reach a long-term contract extension with star right fielder Aaron Judge prior to his Opening Day deadline, general manager Brian Cashman confirmed Friday.
"We're all disappointed right now that we can't be talking about a contract extension today.
For the Yankees, Judge is their best and most marketable player, a player whose value to the franchise transcends his on-field performance.
"Very few people get this opportunity to talk extension," Judge said.
The Judge extension would have tied up approximately $110 million per year in only five players through 2025.

     Summary: The Yankees start the 2022 regular season 1-0 in dramatic fashion with a win over the Red Sox in extra innings on Opening Day.
NEW YORK — The Red Sox and Yankees renewed their timeless rivalry on Friday for an Opening Day clash in the Bronx and it was an instant classic.
Donaldson finished his Yankees debut 2-for-6 out of the leadoff spot while Kiner-Falefa scampered home to score his first run in a Yankees uniform.
Except this time, rather than recording a few outs before serving up a two-run home run, Cole was rocked right away.
New York didn't tie things up again until the eighth when DJ LeMahieu skied a solo homer to the opposite field off Red Sox reliever Garrett Whitlock.

Both clubs scored single runs in the 10th, with the "ghost runner'' rule back in effect - beginning extra innings with a runner at second base.
"It's a big win, Opening Day, getting off on the right foot,'' said Cole, adding that "these games are always just a bit elevated'' against Boston.
