     Dodgers principal owner Mark Walter joins bid to buy Chelsea led by Todd Boehly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Add Los Angeles Dodgers principal owner Mark Walter to the list of heavy hitters, including a number from Major League Baseball, who are trying to buy the Chelsea Football Club.
Walter is joining the bid led by Todd Boehly, one of his partners in the Guggenheim ownership of the Dodgers, according to a source familiar with the bidding process.
The addition of Walter, who has a real-time net worth of $4.4 billion, according to Forbes, figures to put the Boehly group on even stronger financial footing.
Boehly was in London this week, attending Chelsea’s 3-1 loss to Real Madrid in Champions League competition, then meeting with Chelsea Executives on Thursday.
A winning bid by Boehly would make the ownerships of the Dodgers and Boston Red Sox rivals in the Premier League; Red Sox owner John Henry is the principal owner of Liverpool Football Club.

"Max is his toughest critic, but I think his superpower is that he has a very good way of looking over a baseball and can run counts, take walks," Roberts said.
"In a sluggish spring, the Dodgers had consecutive victories just once and never won three in a row.
But with the season opener later in the week, the sense was that the club is where it needs to be.

Given the way last year played out, it’s easy to understand why the Dodgers are approaching the season that way.
Last season I thought the Dodgers would win the division easily.
But despite the questions, their offense and bullpen will be enough to win the division.
How many games will the Dodgers win this season?
