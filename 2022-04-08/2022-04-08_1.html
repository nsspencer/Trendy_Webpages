    </h2>

     Summary: Two outs, bottom of the ninth, tie game on opening day in the Bronx.
Judge comes to bat and rips a line-drive double into the left field corner.
He’s got to trot in with the winning run, right?
The Yankees did beat the Boston Red Sox, 6-5, on Josh Donaldson’s single in the 11th inning.
“I talked to Gardy a little bit about it — he said, ‘Take care of it,’” Judge said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Donaldson comes through with a clutch, walk-off RBI single up the middle to give the Yankees a 6-5 win over the Red Sox.
(0:38)NEW YORK -- Yankees third baseman Josh Donaldson felt the pressure of coming into a new market and making a strong first impression.
"You gotta trust your process and how you go about your business."
The moment for Donaldson to really trust his process came in the bottom of the 11th inning against the rival Boston Red Sox on Opening Day with Isiah Kiner-Falefa on second base to start the inning.
"It's a good feeling to be in an environment where there's an expectation to win," Donaldson said.

     Summary: Yankees All-Star right fielder Aaron Judge reiterated to reporters on Friday that he not interested in discussing a contract extension during the season.
Judge gave the Yankees a deadline of Opening Day for the two sides to reach a contract extension.
After turning down the rumored contract, Judge will head to free agency next winter.
“Very few people get this opportunity to talk extension.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier in the day, Yankees general manager Brian Cashman revealed that negotiations between Judge's camp and the Yankees were off.
Judge deflected certain inquiries, declining to disclose any details stemming from his recent conversations with Yankees brass that occurred behind closed doors.
But I’m not going to get into that.”What Judge did get into, however, is his openness to enter free agency after this season.
The Yankees will be one of those 30 teams," Judge said.
New York and Judge were $4 million apart in arbitration—the Yankees filed at $17 million while Judge's camp asked for $21 million.

     Summary: NEW YORK -- All-Star right fielder Aaron Judge and the New York Yankees did not come to an agreement on a contract extension ahead of the slugger's self-imposed deadline of Opening Day.
General manager Brian Cashman said the team offered a seven-year, $213.5 million extension, which, paired with the $17 million it offered in arbitration this season, would have made the entire package just over $230 million.
"We were unsuccessful in concluding a multiyear pact," Cashman said Friday before the Yankees' 6-5 season-opening win over the Boston Red Sox.
But it doesn't mean that a conclusion in a positive way for the Yankees and Aaron Judge together in the future can't happen.
I got one year to play, and contract extension stuff is nice, but I got bigger things to focus on."

     Summary: NEW YORK -- The New York Yankees failed to reach a long-term contract extension with star right fielder Aaron Judge prior to his Opening Day deadline, general manager Brian Cashman confirmed Friday.
"We're all disappointed right now that we can't be talking about a contract extension today.
For the Yankees, Judge is their best and most marketable player, a player whose value to the franchise transcends his on-field performance.
"Very few people get this opportunity to talk extension," Judge said.
The Judge extension would have tied up approximately $110 million per year in only five players through 2025.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge turned down an extension offer of $230.5 million for the next eight seasons, general manager Brian Cashman said Friday, two hours before the team's 2022 season opener.
Judge set the team's season opener as his deadline for a deal because he does not want to negotiate in-season.
"We don't wind up in (an arbitration) hearing unless we are pushed into a hearing," Cashman said.
The Yankees still hope to reach a long-term deal with Judge, Cashman said.
In the Yankees' opener on Friday, Judge went 2-for-5 with a run scored in the 11-inning win.

     Summary: This Yankees’ offseason, literally to the final minutes before their 2022 opener Friday, played out as if the franchise were trying to see just how much it could dismay and disappoint its fan base.
In between Rizzo’s first-inning homer, with Judge aboard, and Donaldson’s winning single, the Yankees went 0-for-15 with men on base.
LeMahieu has as many top-four MVP finishes with the Yankees (two) as Judge does.
The non-loquacious LeMahieu described himself as “in a good place,” and if he is the Yankees offense upgrades.
This will be the opener when negotiations between Judge and the Yankees closed.
