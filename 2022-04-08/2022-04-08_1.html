     Yankees, Aaron Judge will reportedly not reach contract agreement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Judge’s contract extension deadline with the Yankees is set before the team’s first pitch on Friday at 1:05 p.m.
However, ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported on Friday morning that the right fielder and the team will likely not reach an agreement before the deadline.
This update comes soon after it was reported that Judge’s offered contract would set the Yankees franchise record for a position player if agreed upon, according to reports from multiple MLB insiders.
The contract details are not yet official, but the offer includes a multi-year deal that could reach up to $225 million.
The record deal for a Yankees player is currently pitcher Gerrit Cole, who earns around $36 million per year on his nine-year, $324 million contract.

     Summary: NEW YORK — Gleyber Torres was the Yankees’ budding star two seasons ago.
On Friday, Torres found himself on the bench for the Opening Day matchup against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium.
Manager Aaron Boone started DJ LeMahieu at second base — and put him fifth in the lineup — over Torres.
Torres is expected to be the Yankees’ everyday second baseman the rest of the year, with LeMahieu also playing third base and second base.
But he’ll probably be in there the next three, four, five, days days in there in a row.”Please subscribe to us now and support the local journalism YOU rely on and trust.

Not Gleyber Day Andy Marlin-USA TODAY Sports We've talked for weeks about which Yankee infielder will sit on Opening Day.
Boone has made it clear that there will be reshuffling in the starting lineup throughout the season, a way to manage the Yankees' overloaded infield.
If you look back at last season, Stanton seemed to find a groove when he began injecting some days in the outfield into his weekly routine.

     Aaron Judge rejects the Yankees’ 7-year, $213.5 million offer, set for free agency this winter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Yankees were willing to make Judge the second-highest paid outfielder on an average salary in baseball, offering a seven-year, $213.5 million contract extension.
Judge wanted close to the 10-year, $360 million contract extension that center fielder Mike Trout received from the Los Angeles Angels.
Sorry, the Yankees finally told Judge and his representatives, if you want to finish your career with the Yankees, this is a fair offer.
Now, we’ll see this winter if someone is willing to pay it when he hits free agency.
The Yankees and Judge will meet again one more time, but only in an arbitration hearing, with the Yankees offering $17 million while Judge countered with $21 million.

Cashman said the Yankees offered a seven-year, $213.5 million contract offer that would have run from 2023-29.
Instead, Judge will get a one-year contract through salary arbitration.
He filed at $21 million, the Yankees came in at $17 million and the panel must pick one or the either.
Earlier Friday, Judge said he’d be fine emotionally all season long if he has to settle for a one-year contract.

     Summary: NEW YORK -- All-Star right fielder Aaron Judge and the New York Yankees did not come to an agreement on a contract extension ahead of the slugger's self-imposed deadline of Opening Day.
General manager Brian Cashman said the team offered a seven-year, $213.5 million extension, which, paired with the $17 million it offered in arbitration this season, would have made the entire package just over $230 million.
"We were unsuccessful in concluding a multiyear pact," Cashman said Friday before the Yankees' 6-5 season-opening win over the Boston Red Sox.
But it doesn't mean that a conclusion in a positive way for the Yankees and Aaron Judge together in the future can't happen.
I got one year to play, and contract extension stuff is nice, but I got bigger things to focus on."

     Summary: Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge turned down an extension offer of $230.5 million for the next eight seasons, general manager Brian Cashman said Friday, two hours before the team's 2022 season opener.
New York's offer was $17 million for the 2022 season plus $30.5 million per season for the next seven years, Cashman said.
“We don’t wind up in (an arbitration) hearing unless we are pushed into a hearing," Cashman said.
The Yankees still hope to reach a long-term deal with Judge, Cashman said.
Judge is batting second and playing right field in the Yankees' opener against the Red Sox on Friday.

"We're all disappointed right now that we can't be talking about a contract extension today.
The team's $17 million salary plus the extension would equal eight years and $230.5 million total.
For the Yankees, Judge is their best and most marketable player, a player whose value to the franchise transcends his on-field performance.
The Judge extension would have tied up approximately $110 million per year in only five players through 2025.

     Summary: Over a ten-year span, a $36MM AAV would match Trout’s $360MM guarantee.
10:17am: Yankees GM Brian Cashman told reporters there will be no extension with Aaron Judge today, hours before the slugger’s self-imposed Opening Day deadline.
In a rare disclosure, Cashman detailed that the Yankees offered a seven-year, $213.5MM extension beginning in 2023, representing a $30.5MM average annual value.
Of the 24 arbitration eligible players currently headed toward a midseason hearing to determine their 2022 salary, Judge’s $5MM gap with the Yankees ($17MM vs. $22MM) represents the largest.
Cashman’s comments come less than two hours before the Yankees open their season against the Red Sox, Judge’s deadline for a a contract extension as he enters his walk year.
