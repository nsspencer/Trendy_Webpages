     Summary: Alex Verdugo had a big game for the Red Sox, knocking a go-ahead single through a drawn-in infield in the top of the sixth just after making a diving catch in left field to keep the game tied in the fifth.
With runners on first and second and two outs, Verdugo went to his right to snag LeMahieu's line drive and end the inning.
His catch probability on the play, according to Statcast, was just 30%.

     Yankees, Aaron Judge will reportedly not reach contract agreement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Judge’s contract extension deadline with the Yankees is set before the team’s first pitch on Friday at 1:05 p.m.
However, ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported on Friday morning that the right fielder and the team will likely not reach an agreement before the deadline.
This update comes soon after it was reported that Judge’s offered contract would set the Yankees franchise record for a position player if agreed upon, according to reports from multiple MLB insiders.
The contract details are not yet official, but the offer includes a multi-year deal that could reach up to $225 million.
The record deal for a Yankees player is currently pitcher Gerrit Cole, who earns around $36 million per year on his nine-year, $324 million contract.

     Summary: NEW YORK – Not much had gone right for the Yankees on Opening Day, right from the opening bell.
Josh Donaldson’s ground single to center off rookie Kutter Crawford scored Isiah Kiner-Falefa from second base, giving the Yankees a thrilling 6-5 victory.
“It’s not going to be an issue.’’Gleyber Torres sitsOn Opening Day, Gleyber Torres was the odd man out of Boone's infield alignment.
But one might detect a preference for the veteran DJ LeMahieu at second base on Opening Day over Torres, coming off two subpar seasons and with a little more to prove.

     Summary: “Obviously, our intent is to have Aaron Judge stay with the New York Yankees as we move forward.
Cashman said the Yankees offered a seven-year, $213.5 million contract offer that would have run from 2023-29.
Instead, Judge will get a one-year contract through salary arbitration.
He filed at $21 million, the Yankees came in at $17 million and the panel must pick one or the either.
Earlier Friday, Judge said he’d be fine emotionally all season long if he has to settle for a one-year contract.

     Summary: NEW YORK -- All-Star right fielder Aaron Judge and the New York Yankees did not come to an agreement on a contract extension ahead of the slugger's self-imposed deadline of Opening Day.
General manager Brian Cashman said the team offered a seven-year, $213.5 million extension, which, paired with the $17 million it offered in arbitration this season, would have made the entire package just over $230 million.
"We were unsuccessful in concluding a multiyear pact," Cashman said Friday before the Yankees' 6-5 season-opening win over the Boston Red Sox.
But it doesn't mean that a conclusion in a positive way for the Yankees and Aaron Judge together in the future can't happen.
I got one year to play, and contract extension stuff is nice, but I got bigger things to focus on."

     Summary: NEW YORK -- The New York Yankees failed to reach a long-term contract extension with star right fielder Aaron Judge prior to his Opening Day deadline, general manager Brian Cashman confirmed Friday.
"We're all disappointed right now that we can't be talking about a contract extension today.
For the Yankees, Judge is their best and most marketable player, a player whose value to the franchise transcends his on-field performance.
"Very few people get this opportunity to talk extension," Judge said.
The Judge extension would have tied up approximately $110 million per year in only five players through 2025.
