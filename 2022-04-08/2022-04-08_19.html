     Warriors' Klay Thompson: Unavailable Saturday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thompson has been ruled out for Saturday's game against the Spurs due to right Achilles injury management.
Thompson tallied 33 points, four rebounds and four assists in 33 minutes during Thursday's win over the Lakers, but he'll sit out for the penultimate game of the regular season.
Gary Payton, Damion Lee and Moses Moody should see an uptick in usage.

     Klay Thompson Threw A Paper Airplane During His Post-Game Press Conference: “This Is Like An F16.”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the reasons fans love Klay is because of his sense of humor.
And Thompson's activities during the press conference last night are a great example of that.
After the Los Angeles Lakers lost to the Golden State Warriors, Klay Thompson spoke to the media in his post-game press conference.
During the press conference, Thompson could be seen folding a paper airplane.
As the press conference wrapped up, Klay threw the airplane in the air but was shocked to see it make a U-turn and not go far.

     Warriors' Klay Thompson nearing scoring milestone as season ends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Warriors' offense started slow and stagnant against the Los Angeles Lakers' backup squad, Thompson provided needed points Thursday night at Chase Center.
His latest scoring outbursts have raised his points per game average to 19.7 through 31 games -- just off the magic number.
Since making his return on Jan. 9 earlier this year, Klay hasn't played in both games of a back-to-back.
Kerr typically has played Thompson to open a back-to-back but said Thursday that the plan still is to be determined.
Thompson's first game this season came three days after the Warriors last played the Pelicans.

     Warriors-Lakes score: Klay Thompson goes off in Warriors' win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — As Klay Thompson started to write his redemption story in January, the five-time All-Star knew it wasn’t going to be easy.
But 31 games into his return and with the playoffs on the horizon, Thompson said he is finally starting to feel like himself again.
Thompson led the Warriors to a 128-112 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, who were without LeBron James, Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis.
It wasn’t his biggest scoring performance of the season, though coach Steve Kerr called it Thompson’s “best game” yet.
“In the playoffs your best players have to perform, and I really like where Klay is now,” Kerr said.

     Klay’s 33 points leads Warriors to 128-112 win over Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When fans bought tickets to the Golden State Warriors-Los Angeles Lakers game before the season, they probably expected an epic scoring duel with playoff seeding on the line.
It’s the first time Klay had back-to-back 30-point games since 2019, although that’s the case for almost all of Klay’s accomplishments this season.
Malik Monk had 24 points and two blocks, remaining one of the few bright spots for the reeling Lakers squad this year.
Unfortunately, Monk’s 13.4 points per game and 39% shooting from deep probably also mean that he’s out of the Lakers’ price range for next season.
The Lakers never got closer than seven points after that, and Draymond Green closed things out as a passer.
