     Private Astronauts Launching to Space Station Don’t Want to Be ‘Tourists’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Friday, a retired NASA astronaut and three paying customers set off on a journey to the International Space Station.
The mission is the first to go to the space station on which all of the passengers are private citizens, and it is the first time that NASA has collaborated in arranging a space tourism visit.
The flight marked a pivotal moment in efforts to spur space travel by commercial enterprises, NASA officials said.
Axiom Space of Houston acted as the tour operator, selling seats for the 10-day trip, including eight days aboard the station, for $55 million each.
Axiom hired SpaceX to provide the transportation — a Falcon 9 rocket with a Crew Dragon capsule, the same system that takes NASA astronauts to and from the station.

     3 visitors heading to the space station are paying $55M each, all meals included
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia has been hosting tourists at the space station — and before that the Mir station — for decades.
NASA is finally getting into the act, after years of opposing space station visitors.
The visitors' tickets include access to all but the Russian portion of the space station — they'll need permission from the three cosmonauts on board.
Lopez-Alegria plans to avoid talking about politics and the war in Ukraine while he's at the space station.
"They're not up there to paste their nose on the window," said Axiom's co-founder and president, Michael Suffredini, a former NASA space station program manager.

     SpaceX successfully launches first all-private crew en route to space station for Axiom Space
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The four private flyers, riding to space with a commercial aerospace company called Axiom Space, are now en route to the International Space Station after launching from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket.
Axiom’s long-term goal is to build a fleet of commercial space stations, beginning with Axiom Station.
The company plans to attach the first module of Axiom Station to the ISS as early as 2024 before eventually breaking away and building a free-flying platform.
“Enjoy your trip to that wonderful space station in the sky.
Axiom is also paying an undisclosed sum to NASA to use the space agency’s facilities on the ISS.

     SpaceX launches Axiom-1 private astronaut mission to ISS
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Their Crew Dragon capsule, named Endeavour, was slated to dock with the ISS at 7:45 a.m. EDT Saturday while the ISS travels some 17,500 mph.
An on-time undocking of the Axiom-1 mission is critical for NASA to avoid a domino effect.
With the Axiom-1 mission cleared, NASA plans to return to the "wet dress rehearsal" of its SLS rocket on Saturday, April 9.
Present for the Axiom-1 launch was billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, the commander of SpaceX's first private orbital mission last year known as Inspiration4.
Isaacman expects the first SpaceX Crew Dragon Polaris mission, called Dawn, to take flight toward the end of this year.

     SpaceX launch: Tourists just launched to the ISS. Here's everything you need to know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's all in line with the US government's and the private sector's goal to boost commercial activity on the ISS and beyond.
The mission is made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated.
"The professional relationship between our international partners, astronauts and cosmonauts continues for the safety and mission of all on board the ISS."
Last year, the FAA decided to end the entire Commercial Space Astronaut Wings program on January 1, 2022.
Whether it's fair to still refer to people who pay their way to space as "astronauts" is an open question, and countless observers — including NASA astronauts — have weighed in.

     SpaceX launches first all-commercial crew to space station

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches the Axiom-1 mission with a commercial crew of four headed to the International Space Station, April 8, 2022.
The launching marked the sixth piloted flight of a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.
If all goes well, the spacecraft will dock with the International Space Station early Saturday.
Eleven private astronauts, or "space tourists," have visited the space station over the past two decades under commercial arrangements with the Russian space agency.
The mission was financed by Axiom Space, a company with deep roots in the aerospace community that is working with NASA to build commercial space station modules that initially will be attached to the International Space Station.
