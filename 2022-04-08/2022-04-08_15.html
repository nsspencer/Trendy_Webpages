     'Everything Everywhere All at Once' review: Michelle Yeoh stars in the mind-bending metaverse movie you didn't know you needed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Strange, surreal and unexpectedly sentimental, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” is genuinely and wildly original – the kung fu/science fiction/metaphysical action comedy that you didn’t know you needed, but just might love.
“Might” does a lot of work there, because while the film will have its well-deserved admirers, the dizzying nature of it won’t be for everyone.
Indeed, those expecting a full-throttle action vehicle, as the trailer seems to indicate, might find themselves adjusting to the movie’s initial pacing.
Nor does it help that the movie could excise 20-30 minutes and not lose much, certainly in the way of clarity.
“Everything Everywhere All at Once” premieres in wide release in US theaters on April 8.

     What younger Asian actors tell Michelle Yeoh: ‘Finally, I can see myself’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michelle Yeoh is everywhere.
“What [is special about] this moment in my career is having so many people who look like me, especially the younger generation [of Asian actors], come up to me and say, ‘Finally, I can see myself doing all these kinds of things because you are doing it,’” Yeoh told People magazine in an interview published Thursday.
By a strange twist of fate, Evelyn is soon transported into various parallel universes occupied by different, powerful versions of herself.
After premiering at the SXSW Film Festival, the genre-bending fantasy has received a 97% rating on review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.
“I have to appreciate the ride I’ve been on,” Yeoh told People.

     Michelle Yeoh achieves ‘Everything Everywhere All At Once’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But if you take away just one thing, let it be that Michelle Yeoh kicks ass and this film is definitive proof of that.
Yeoh plays Evelyn Wang who starts the film with IRS problems that escalate to an existential level.
Yeoh dazzles us as she goes from frumpy to glamorous, beaten down to triumphant, bewildered to confident.
But one thing is clear: Michelle Yeoh is a force to be reckoned with.
And hopefully this film by the Daniels will wake Hollywood up to what Yeoh is capable of, so she can get some more showcase roles.

     Summary: MICHELLE YEOH: I’m blushing!
When I read the script, I thought, “There’s no way I’m going to do this ‘hotdog fingers’ thing.
In the movie I’m doing now, my character’s name is Paul.
You can’t know what you’re going to do in the space with the cameras until you’re there.
But I’m going to have to find a way to distract her when Stephanie is flinging the dildos around.

     Summary: And hopefully, as you’re falling, you’re laughing as well, because I think that’s the only way to handle it.
Michelle: When we started out The Daniels obviously don’t speak Chinese, Daniel Kwan speaks a little bit.
I think that’s very, very important.
I just watched The Man Who Fell to Earth, oh my god, and you think that’s not a TV series!
I don’t know, it’s too technical for me for my little brain to comprehend.
