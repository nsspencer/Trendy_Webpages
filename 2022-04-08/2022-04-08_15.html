     SpaceX launches commercial mission to ISS
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: COLORADO SPRINGS — SpaceX launched a Crew Dragon spacecraft April 8 carrying four commercial astronauts to the International Space Station for Axiom Space.
Endeavour is flying the Ax-1 mission for commercial human spaceflight company Axiom Space.
Ax-1 is Axiom’s first mission and a key milestone in its long-term efforts to develop a commercial space station.
“It was just a large amount of items to go through,” said Angela Hart, NASA commercial LEO program manager, at the postlaunch briefing.
The mission is a pathfinder for future commercial missions to the ISS, which themselves serve as a transition to the installation of commercial modules by Axiom on the ISS and, by the end of the decade, one or more commercial space stations that will succeed the ISS.

     3 visitors heading to the space station are paying $55M each, all meals included
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia has been hosting tourists at the space station — and before that the Mir station — for decades.
NASA is finally getting into the act, after years of opposing space station visitors.
The visitors' tickets include access to all but the Russian portion of the space station — they'll need permission from the three cosmonauts on board.
Lopez-Alegria plans to avoid talking about politics and the war in Ukraine while he's at the space station.
"They're not up there to paste their nose on the window," said Axiom's co-founder and president, Michael Suffredini, a former NASA space station program manager.

     SpaceX successfully launches first all-private crew en route to space station for Axiom Space
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The four private flyers, riding to space with a commercial aerospace company called Axiom Space, are now en route to the International Space Station after launching from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket.
Axiom’s long-term goal is to build a fleet of commercial space stations, beginning with Axiom Station.
The company plans to attach the first module of Axiom Station to the ISS as early as 2024 before eventually breaking away and building a free-flying platform.
“Enjoy your trip to that wonderful space station in the sky.
Axiom is also paying an undisclosed sum to NASA to use the space agency’s facilities on the ISS.

     First all-private astronaut team lifts off for ISS in milestone SpaceX flight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A SpaceX rocket ship has blasted off carrying the first all-private astronaut team ever launched to the International Space Station (ISS), a flight hailed by industry executives and Nasa as a milestone in the commercialisation of spaceflight.
The Axiom team will be sharing the weightless work environment with seven regular, government-paid ISS crew members: three American astronauts, a German and three Russian cosmonauts.
Lopez-Alegria, 63, the Spanish-born Axiom mission commander, is also the company’s vice-president for business development.
Nasa has no plans to invest in a new space station once the ISS is retired, around 2030.
In the meantime, Axiom said it has contracted with SpaceX to fly three more private astronaut missions to the space station over the next two years.

     SpaceX launches first all-commercial crew to space station

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches the Axiom-1 mission with a commercial crew of four headed to the International Space Station, April 8, 2022.
The launching marked the sixth piloted flight of a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.
If all goes well, the spacecraft will dock with the International Space Station early Saturday.
Eleven private astronauts, or "space tourists," have visited the space station over the past two decades under commercial arrangements with the Russian space agency.
The mission was financed by Axiom Space, a company with deep roots in the aerospace community that is working with NASA to build commercial space station modules that initially will be attached to the International Space Station.

     SpaceX launch: Tourists just launched to the ISS. Here's everything you need to know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's all in line with the US government's and the private sector's goal to boost commercial activity on the ISS and beyond.
The mission is made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated.
"The professional relationship between our international partners, astronauts and cosmonauts continues for the safety and mission of all on board the ISS."
Last year, the FAA decided to end the entire Commercial Space Astronaut Wings program on January 1, 2022.
Whether it's fair to still refer to people who pay their way to space as "astronauts" is an open question, and countless observers — including NASA astronauts — have weighed in.
