The relationship is still fairly new, and according to BuzzFeed News, filming for The Kardashians took place starting back in September 2021, which is before Scott and Rebecca started dating.
The Kardashians premiere is on Hulu on April 14, 2022.

     Scott Disick Steps Out With Model Rebecca Donaldson at Hulu Premiere
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch : How Scott Disick REALLY Feels About Pete Davidson &amp; Travis BarkerLord Disick and Kravis unite!
On April 7, Scott Disick joined his ex Kourtney Kardashian, her fiancé Travis Barker and her family members at the premiere of their new Hulu reality show The Kardashians in Los Angeles.
Scott walked the red carpet holding hands with model Rebecca Donaldson, while Kourtney and Travis posed with her son Reign Disick, 7, as well as Travis' kids Landon Barker, 18, Alabama Barker, 16, and his stepdaughter Atiana De La Hoya, 23.
The event marked the first time Scott and the couple have been photographed on the same red carpet, although the three have occasionally attended the same private gatherings and family trips.
Since their 2015 breakup, Scott and Kourtney have continued to co-parent their kids Mason Disick, 12, Penelope Disick, 9, and Reign.

     Scott Disick, Rebecca Donaldson make red carpet debut at ‘Kardashians’ premiere
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mere days after Kourtney Kardashian fake-married Travis Barker in Las Vegas, her ex Scott Disick made his red carpet debut with girlfriend Rebecca Donaldson at Hulu’s premiere of “The Kardashians” Thursday.
Disick and Donaldson held hands as they posed for photos at the headline-making event.
It’s unclear what happened to model Holly Scarfone, whom Disick had been with in Paris last month.
Donaldson opted for a one-shoulder gray dress for the event, while Disick, who looked fairly miserable at the soiree, wore a black suit.
In photos separate from the carpet, the couple could be seen holding hands as they made their way inside the event.
