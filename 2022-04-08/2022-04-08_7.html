    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple’s coverage of Friday Night Baseball on the Apple TV Plus app will be produced by Major League Baseball’s television network, the company affirmed this week.
Apple says streamers can watch select Friday Night Baseball games through the Apple TV Plus app without a subscription.
The Apple TV Plus app is available on Apple TV hardware, on iPhones, iPads and Macintosh computers.
Versions of the Apple TV App are also available for Android TV (Google TV), Roku and Comcast’s X1 platform.

     Summary: Great news Apple TV users!
If you have an Apple TV, your wishes for a better experience with the HBO Max app may be coming true.
Apple TV users have had a long-standing issue.
Hopefully, Apple TV users won’t have to relive such a horrifying experience ever again.
Discovery CFO Gunnar Wieidenfels recently said the mid-term goal is to unify HBO Max and Discovery Plus into one platform.

     HBO Max Finally Gets Around to Fixing Its Apple TV App
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new and improved HBO Max, which was developed by WarnerMedia's You.i TV team, now an internal working group following WB's purchase of the eponymous Canadian start-up in 2020, subsequently rolled out to Playstation, Android, Samsung, LG, Vizio, Vodafone, Comcast and Cox video platforms.
Seven months later, WarnerMedia has finally announced the same fix for frustrated Apple TV 4K users.
In addition to addressing core issues, like unexpected crashes, the new, more stable app -- like earlier fixes for other platforms -- looks basically the same as the legacy HBO Max app, which built on a coding infrastructure written nearly a decade ago for HBO's much simpler TV Everywhere/Go era.
Notably, the computer processing horsepower of the latest Apple TV 4K device, superior to most other OTT gadgets in the market, will also be specifically utilized for things like interface animations.
WarnerMedia said the rollout of the new HBO Max app for Apple TV is ongoing and should culminate next week.

     Summary: In an exclusive deal with MLB, Apple TV+ will begin streaming some major games, with a twist.
You can watch Friday Night Baseball on the Apple TV app, select smart TVs, gaming consoles, and cable set-top boxes, and on your browser at TV.apple.com.
If you want to watch anything other than baseball on Apple TV+, though, you’ll have to sign-up for the seven-day free trial for new subscribers.
One thing to note: Android users cannot gain access to the Apple TV+ app on their phones.
In order to watch the games, you’ll have to use a device that is Apple-compatible, such as your smart TV or your Apple MacBook.

There's no need to subscribe to Apple TV+, which costs $4.99 per month, to watch.
I spoke Thursday with Apple representatives who told me the company's focus isn't to dominate market share with services such as Apple TV+.
Of course, you could easily argue far more people would be signing up for Apple TV+ if it were that good.
Think about Apple TV+ the same way you think about all the extras included with your Amazon Prime subscription.

     HBO Max app for Apple TV gets much-needed refresh
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The refresh comes after WarnerMedia acknowledged last year that the HBO Max experience on various platforms left a lot to be desired, with customers complaining that HBO Max’s connected TV app for Apple TV, Roku and other devices was buggy and difficult to use.
Despite the issues, at least one survey published last September said HBO Max had the highest customer satisfaction among competing streaming video services.
(Comcast’s X1 also powers Cox set-top boxes, which received the refreshed HBO Max app as well.)
This week, company officials confirmed an updated version of the HBO Max app was rolling out to Apple TV customers that fixed many of the same issues.
The refreshed app includes a full “My Stuff” experience for Apple TV users that will allow customers to update their content queue with ease.

The previous app was built on the old HBO Go and HBO Now app framework that just wasn’t cutting it for users.
Now, Apple TV users and those using Apple TV 4K boxes will be able to start enjoying the new upgraded app as soon as this week, with the rollout beginning now through next week.
WarnerMedia’s next item on the to-do list will be overhauling the app for Amazon Fire TV.
