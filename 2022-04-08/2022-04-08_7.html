     A look at the marvelous career of Michelle Yeoh
    </h2>

     Summary: Hollywood has too many sins to list—not least how swiftly it discards women the minute they sprout a single grey hair.
That's why I'm so intrigued by A24's multi-dimensional epic Everything Everywhere All At Once, starring Michelle Yeoh.
It feels like I'm in another dimension just writing that sentence.
The 80s Hong Kong cinema legend owns one of the most compelling filmographies in history.
GQ sits down with Yeoh in the video embedded above and talks about her most iconic characters.

American audiences will know her as a warrior in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or an icy matriarch in Crazy Rich Asians.
Now, in Everything Everywhere All At Once, she's playing Chinese immigrant Evelyn Wang who is both a failure and possibly the key to saving the multiverse from a great chaos-spreading evil.
Michelle Yeoh talks with NPR's Ailsa Chang about her journey through the multiverse, with all its wackiness, wonder and wisdom.

     What younger Asian actors tell Michelle Yeoh: ‘Finally, I can see myself’

     Summary: Michelle Yeoh is everywhere.
“What [is special about] this moment in my career is having so many people who look like me, especially the younger generation [of Asian actors], come up to me and say, ‘Finally, I can see myself doing all these kinds of things because you are doing it,’” Yeoh told People magazine in an interview published Thursday.
By a strange twist of fate, Evelyn is soon transported into various parallel universes occupied by different, powerful versions of herself.
After premiering at the SXSW Film Festival, the genre-bending fantasy has received a 97% rating on review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.
“I have to appreciate the ride I’ve been on,” Yeoh told People.

     Summary: The buddy cop film — starring two females, Michelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock (left), somewhat of a first — was just Yeoh's second feature.
"The first hurdle I had to go through was the guys accepting me to the boys' club," she told The Hollywood Reporter.
She joined the stuntmen at the gym, asking them to teach her their ways.
"I think it was quite refreshing for them," she added.
"Humility goes a long way."

     Summary: Let's state the facts: Michelle Yeoh is an icon.
She is the Michelle Yeoh!
Though Yeoh has been a headlining performer for many projects in the Hong Kong film industry, this is her first time being the top-billed star in a Hollywood movie.
And I think all of us who read the script just fell in love and wanted to get it done.
And I think that's what we've tried to do in Everything Everywhere All at Once.

In the movie I’m doing now, my character’s name is Paul.
You can’t know what you’re going to do in the space with the cameras until you’re there.
But I’m going to have to find a way to distract her when Stephanie is flinging the dildos around.

Michelle: When we started out The Daniels obviously don’t speak Chinese, Daniel Kwan speaks a little bit.
I think that’s very, very important.
I just watched The Man Who Fell to Earth, oh my god, and you think that’s not a TV series!
I don’t know, it’s too technical for me for my little brain to comprehend.

     Summary: Somewhere, in one of the gajillion strands of the cat’s cradle of multiverses, there is a world in which Michelle Yeoh does not start ballet lessons at the age of four.
He’s dining with a good friend of the then-21-year-old Michelle Yeoh, who had been reluctantly entered into a beauty contest by her mom and walked away with the title of Miss Malaysia.
By the time the producers of Tomorrow Never Dies, the 1997 James Bond film, came calling, Yeoh was ready to return.
Yeoh does not even need to get up to demonstrate.
“It’s ‘Michelle Wong, Michelle Yeoh…Michelle Wong, Michelle Yeoh.’ I pictured someone in audience sitting in the theater, someone on screen yells ‘Michelle,’ I turn around and the first thing they think is, ‘My god, why does Michelle Yeoh look so old!?
