     Pull Out All the Old Knives
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The way that The Hunt For Red October kicked off a series of Cold War thrillers, in the 1990s, that came out when the Cold War was already over, the new Amazon film All the Old Knives serves as a belated War on Terror thriller.
This is a better film, which delves into War on Terror-era regrets without getting especially political, and also without ever turning into 24.
Movies where there's an earth-shattering plot twist every 10 minutes can get annoying, but All the Old Knives handles its plotting better, and the ending is especially well-executed.
All the Old Knives comes out Friday, both in limited theaters and on Amazon Prime.
All the Old Knives avoided such a fate, instead acquired by the world’s second-most valuable company.

     “All The Old Knives”: A review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “All The Old Knives,” adapted from Olen Steinhauer’s novel of the same name, opens in 2012 inside the cabin of Flight 127, which is being hijacked.
Embarrassed by the high-profile incident, the CIA is still dedicated to discovering the identity of the mole responsible.
“All The Old Knives” is a brilliant take on the ways that both espionage and love are wildly unpredictable.
“All The Old Knives” serves as a reminder to ask the hard questions from the people you love and to offer grace in the place of doubt.
Old wounds can often be the most difficult to heal — similarly old knives can be just as sharp… and deadly.

     Review: Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton bring restrained passion to ‘All the Old Knives’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Secrets, score settling, grudge holding, deception and recriminations are, of course, the stuff of international espionage.
All of which is to say international espionage and romantic entanglements both revolve around the essential unknowability of other people.
Such is the aim of “All the Old Knives,” a cerebral thriller with an elegant sensibility directed by Janus Metz from a screenplay by Olen Steinhauer adapting his own novel.
Director Metz previously made the tennis-world psychodrama “Borg vs. McEnroe,” a fitting connection as “All the Old Knives” is rooted in the back-and-forth volleys of its two main characters.
“All The Old Knives” comes out right after “The Contractor,” which also stars Pine and had ambitions to merge a domestic drama with an action thriller, shades of Robert Ludlum akin to “Old Knives’” nods to John Le Carré.

     ‘All the Old Knives’ review: Who double-crossed whom? Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton play ex-lovers and spies facing off over dinner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Laurence Fishburne (as Henry’s current boss) and Jonathan Pryce (as Celia’s former boss) make brief appearances.
Events from the day of the hijacking arrive in flashback, taking us away from the restaurant — a lovely space that is empty of people and visual interest — but the change of scenery doesn’t enliven things between Pine and Newton, who are left to do little more than inject some intensity into these underdeveloped characters.
There’s a self-seriousness in the way they’ve been directed (they bring a more methodical energy to the table than Thompson and Rickman did in “A Song for Lunch”) that tends to suck all the tension from their spy vs. spy do-si-do.
Scenes of the couple naked in bed back in Vienna lack eroticism and fail to convey anything meaningful about their head space in those moments.

     ‘All The Old Knives’ Review: Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton Salvage a Tired Spy Thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All The Old Knives is, unfortunately, a rather forgettable spy thriller that stars the unforgettable duo of Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton.
All the Old Knives continues to utilize non-linear storytelling to reveal key components of the story, using the length of Chris Pine’s hair to distinguish the past from the present.
While All The Old Knives is a fairly cut-and-paste spy story, it actually does satisfy on the eroticism front.
All The Old Knives attempts to convince its audiences that it is a tawdry game of chess, but in reality, it’s a game of checkers.
All The Old Knives premieres on Prime Video this Friday.

     Summary: Well, in the case of Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton’s All the Old Knives characters, that’s when the secrets come out.
Chris, what was it like working with Thandiwe on the movie?
Well, Thandiwe, I was going to ask you, what was it like working with Chris, one of the Hollywood Chrises?
So the film really is a collaborative piece.
I think that’s partly because Chris is a producer.
