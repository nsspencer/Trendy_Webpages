     Lucas Giolito leaves White Sox opener with abdominal tightness; Tigers rally to win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DETROIT — The reaction was universal wherever White Sox passion existed on Opening Day Friday.
Giolito had pitched four scoreless innings and everything seemed fine before Bennett Sousa trotted in from center field to open the Tigers fifth with the Sox leading 3-0.
Lynn, who had knee surgery to repair a tendon on Tuesday, had been the likely choice to start the opener.
The Sox led 1-0 on Eloy Jimenez’ RBI single in the first inning that scored Jose Abreu and added two runs in the second on an RBI single by leadoff hitter AJ Pollock and RBI double by Luis Robert.
After Baez flied out to deep left, Kendall Graveman replaced Crick and gave up a single to Jeimer Candelario for the Tigers’ first run.
