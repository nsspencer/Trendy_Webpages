     Summary: “To get thrown into the spot he did two years ago, it’s like, ‘Well, what did you expect?’” veteran Curt Casali said.
But he got a few games under his belt last year for us and helped us win a couple of games, which was enormous.
And now in spring, he was kind of what we were all expecting Joey to be: To be the dude.
He’s been tremendous behind the plate as well.
I expect huge things from him.”

     SF Giants' Brandon Belt makes fun entrance to Oracle Park
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO – First baseman Brandon Belt made an unforgettable entrance to Oracle Park on Friday – one only a captain can make – as part of the Giants’ elaborate Opening Day festivities prior to their game with the Miami Marlins.
Belt then threw out the first pitch to Giants manager Gabe Kapler.
This is his 12th season in a Giants uniform, and Friday was the 11th time he’s been on an Opening Day roster.

     Giants third baseman Evan Longoria progressing well after finger surgery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though Evan Longoria’s return to the Giants’ lineup might be a little quicker than initially expected, Tommy La Stella remains in a holding pattern.
Now Playing: The Giants' Evan Longoria, who is rehabbing from hand surgery, does a fielding drill at Oracle Park before the Opening Day game against Miami.
“Obviously, I’m not happy I don’t get to put the uniform on and run out there on Opening Day,” Longoria said.
“But we’re in a good spot, we’re as deep as we were last year.”The depth will get tested with La Stella out indefinitely as he rehabs following an Achilles tendon cleanup.
La Stella said Friday the plan is to go day-to-day, because he still has discomfort.

     SF Giants injury update: La Stella, Longoria, Wade detail recovery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: La Stella and the Giants discussed carrying him as a designated hitter but decided to play it safe instead.
“It was always up in the air, so we understood this was a realistic possibility,” La Stella said.
But after a follow-up consultation last week with Dr. Robert Anderson, who performed the operation, La Stella isn’t concerned.
“There’s always scar tissue elements of this that there’s really nothing other than just breaking through it, and that can take time,” La Stella said.
Wade almost certainly would have found a spot in the Opening Day lineup against Marlins right-hander Sandy Alcantara but will be forced to watch from the dugout, alongside La Stella and Longoria.

     SF Giants fans enjoy walk-off on rare Opening Day at home
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — For the first time since 2009, the shores of McCovey Cove were rocking on MLB’s Opening Day.
It was the same season Tim Lincecum began a streak of 11 straight seasons with a homegrown pitcher starting on Opening Day (retired catcher Buster Posey caught 10 of them).
It made for the most memorable Opening Day entrance since Madison Bumgarner began the 2015 season by riding into the ballpark on horseback.
Though it arrived eight days after Opening Day was previously scheduled, the festivities Giants fans witnessed Friday helped make up for a harsh winter.
Upon the return of live action, fans rejoiced in their chance to live and die again with Giants baseball.

     Summary: The Giants’ fill-in second baseman ( maybe more than a fill-in) clobbered a homer to left leading off the ninth, promptly tying the game.
And rookie catcher Joey Bart, making his first Opening Day start as succeeds franchise icon Buster Posey, belted the team’s first homer.
That’s right: Belt bunt, Bart belt.
And Belt belt.
Bart became the first Giants player to hit his first career home run on Opening Day since Will Clark in 1986.

     Austin Slater, Giants walk-off Marlins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In my first draft I focused on the Giants 25-year old Opening Day battery of Logan Webb and Joey Bart.
It ended up working out well for the 2021 Giants, so it made sense that the the 2022 Giants would follow the blueprint.
My third and hopefully final draft focuses on the fact that the Giants did everything in this game, good and bad.
Let’s talk about how Bart scored after his walk, which was the first run of the game for the Giants.
And congrats to the Giants and Marlins for eschewing Rob Manfred’s pathetic rule, and managing to end an extra-innings game without scoring a single ghost runner.
