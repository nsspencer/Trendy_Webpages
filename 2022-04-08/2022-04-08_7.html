     SF Giants' Joey Bart hits first career homer on Opening Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — In Joey Bart’s first audition as the Giants’ starting catcher, he came to the plate 111 times and didn’t trot around the bases once.
So in his second plate appearance of the official start of his tenure, Bart took time to admire the ball that launched off his bat.
When it landed about a dozen rows up in the left-field bleachers, 414 feet away from home plate, the 25-year-old catcher had notched his first career homer and extended the Giants’ lead to 3-0.
Prior to Bart, the last Giants rookie to hit his first career homer on Opening Day was Will Clark, who homered in his first career major league at-bat off Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan in 1986.
By getting the nod behind the plate on Opening Day, Bart gave the Giants a homegrown battery as he caught Logan Webb, another product of the Giants’ drafting and development.

     What's that thing on Joey Bart's arm? An explainer on how the SF Giants are using PitchCom on Opening Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants are one of the reportedly-about-half of MLB squads that will be trying out a device known as PitchCom.
Prior to this, the Giants’ new starting catcher, Joey Bart, would have used his fingers to signal what pitch he wanted Opening Day starter Logan Webb to throw his way.
Instead, Bart will press one of the 81 combinations of buttons on the PitchCom device on his wrist to send that message to Webb.
The catcher said Thursday he intends to use the technology with nearly all of the Giants’ pitching staff.
This doesn’t change the fact that pitchers can still reject pitch suggestions with the famous shake of the head while on the mound, nor does it mean catchers can’t revert to finger signals if a pitcher spends a lot of time rejecting pitch suggestions.

     SF Giants' Brandon Belt makes fun entrance to Oracle Park
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO – First baseman Brandon Belt made an unforgettable entrance to Oracle Park on Friday – one only a captain can make – as part of the Giants’ elaborate Opening Day festivities prior to their game with the Miami Marlins.
Belt threw baseballs into the crowd and saluted his teammates once he arrived at the dugout.
Belt then threw out the first pitch to Giants manager Gabe Kapler.
Belt isn’t an official team captain but began using the moniker last September.
Belt leaned into it, saying at the time, “I was not going to wear it, but everybody thought that I should.

     SF Giants injury update: La Stella, Longoria, Wade detail recovery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: La Stella and the Giants discussed carrying him as a designated hitter but decided to play it safe instead.
“It was always up in the air, so we understood this was a realistic possibility,” La Stella said.
But after a follow-up consultation last week with Dr. Robert Anderson, who performed the operation, La Stella isn’t concerned.
“There’s always scar tissue elements of this that there’s really nothing other than just breaking through it, and that can take time,” La Stella said.
Wade almost certainly would have found a spot in the Opening Day lineup against Marlins right-hander Sandy Alcantara but will be forced to watch from the dugout, alongside La Stella and Longoria.

Now Playing: The Giants' Evan Longoria, who is rehabbing from hand surgery, does a fielding drill at Oracle Park before the Opening Day game against Miami.
“Obviously I’m not happy I don’t get to put the uniform on and run out there on Opening Day,” Longoria said.
“But we’re in a good spot, we’re as deep as we were last year.”The depth will get tested with La Stella out indefinitely as he rehabs following an Achilles tendon cleanup.
La Stella said Friday the plan is just to go day-to-day, because he still has discomfort.

     SF Giants: Logan Webb realizes potential with Opening Day start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — When Logan Webb takes the mound Friday afternoon, at 25 years old, he’ll become the Giants’ youngest Opening Day starter in more than a decade, a homegrown product with a dozen family members in the stands.
Last year’s Opening Day starter, Kevin Gausman, served as the 2021 staff’s spiritual leader.
But last season, Webb reduced the walk rate to one every 4.1 innings while getting more strikeouts than he ever had before.
Webb had every right to presume that the Opening Day nod was his.
He’ll be the youngest Opening Day starter since Lincecum, at 24, in 2009.

     Summary: Editor’s note: At Friday’s Opening Day for the Giants, Alexandra Irving is the official scorer of the Giants’ game against the Marlins, one of four women who will be the official scorer on Opening Day this season — something has never happened before in MLB.
I always looked up to them but never actually thought I could be an official scorer myself.
I thrived in the class and was officially hired as an official scorer in early 2022.
And now here I am, making history as one of the first women to ever be official scorer for an Opening Day.
Alexandra Irving is a newsroom producer for The San Francisco Chronicle and an official scorer for MLB.
