     What is Groupel?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GRAUPEL is when snowflakes are wrapped in snow.
Graupel isn’t as hard as hail, but not as soft as fluffy snowflakes, in fact, it’s similar in structure to Dippin’ Dots ice cream.
Graupel is also known as “soft hail” to many people, but it is not actually a hail.
Instead, graupel is like little beads filled with ice and only lightly covered with ice, making them too soft to crush.
To understand how graupel forms, one must first remember that all winter weather begins as snow in the atmosphere.

     A Wintry Mix On Saturday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We'll see rain/snow/sleet/graupel showers and it'll be unusually cold through most of the day.
When you get under these wintry mix showers it will become windy as temperatures drop in the showers.
It will be cold, but with a bit of luck, the stuff falling from the sky will finish by post time.
As optimism continues, we'll get another nice warm up heading into next week.
We'll keep a close eye on that warm up as by Wednesday and Thursday strong storm possibilities will be with us.

     Sleet, hail and graupel - The scientific breakdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Are meteorologists making up new terms for sleet and hail?
While hail is normally associated with thunderstorms and sleet consist of melted snowflakes that refreeze into hard pieces of ice, graupel is just a little different.
When snowflakes find themselves among traces of supercooled water, the water adheres to the ice of the snowflake, freezing instantly.
What you see falling are little snow pellets which you can squish with your fingers.
While hail can cause damage, sleet is just little pieces of hard ice, while graupel are little snow pellets.

Graupel is also known as "soft hail" to many but it's actually not hail at all.
During the process that forms graupel, snowflakes collide with supercooled water droplets as they get tumbled by the turbulence.
2 Hail is much more dense than graupel Credit: GettyEssentially, hail is pure ice and is hard and dense, while graupel is much softer and only lightly glazed with ice.
Also, while hail is exclusive to thunderstorms, graupel can happen whenever the conditions are right.
