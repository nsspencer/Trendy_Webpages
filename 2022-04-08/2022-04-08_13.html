    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I've loved it ever since I put on that jersey for the first time," Crawford said before the Mariners' season opener against the Minnesota Twins.
He could shift further down in the batting order this season after Seattle acquired Adam Frazier in the offseason.
Crawford is due $10 million per year from 2023 to 2025 before receiving $11 million in the final season of the deal.
"He took me under his wing and showed me how to really love baseball again," Crawford said.
With Rodriguez, Winker, Jarred Kelenic, Mitch Haniger, Ty France and others, the Mariners don't necessarily need to depend on Crawford's bat.

Robbie Ray won the AL Cy Young with Toronto last year.
Both are listed on FanGraphs as reaching a higher average velocity than Mr. Robbie had ever achieved before.
It appears that Mr. Ryan is into classic cars.

Shortstop J.P. Crawford and the Seattle Mariners are in agreement on a five-year, $51 million contract, sources familiar with the deal tell ESPN.
And he flashed the leather throughout, including one of the most spectacular throws I’ve ever seen live:In 2021, Crawford finally hit his stride.
Per Jon Heyman, it seems that Crawford also negotiated a full no-trade clause this year:JP Crawford $51M, 5-year Mariners extension contains no option years, full no-trade in 1st year, 5 team protection after that with $1M bonus with each trade.
1st year is $5M signing bonus and $5M salary @JeffPassan 1st — Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) April 8, 2022With news of the Crawford extension, one has to wonder if we’ll get any other late-breaking extension news before first pitch this afternoon.

“I felt really good,” Ray said.
“I didn’t think he was quite as sharp in the sixth and it was time to pass the baton and that was going to be the end of his day,” Servais said.
This is definitely a good starting point.”The Mariners had plenty of base runners, tallying five hits and working seven walks.
The Mariners turned to their two best relievers in 2021 to close out the win for Ray.

     Summary: MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Seattle Mariners signed Gold Glove shortstop J.P. Crawford to a $51 million, five-year contract on Friday ahead of the start of the regular season.
Crawford, 27, had agreed last month to a $4.85 million, one-year deal and would have been eligible for free agency after the 2024 season.
I’ve loved it ever since I put on that jersey for the first time,” Crawford said before the season opener against the Twins.
Since the start of the 2020 season, Crawford leads all American League shortstops in innings played at the position with 1,876.
“He took me under his wing and showed me how to really love baseball again,” Crawford said.

     Summary: MINNEAPOLIS — In the days after the 2021 season ended in disappointment, Mariners president of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto made calling J.P. Crawford his first priority.
On the day the Mariners’ much-anticipated 2022 season began, Dipoto and the organization proved their words weren’t hollow, signing Crawford to a five-year, $51 million contract extension.
In a news conference at Target Field, hours before first pitch, Crawford, Dipoto and Mariners chairman John Stanton discussed the extension.
“This is a fun way to kick off our season,” Dipoto said.
He’s an old guy, but he’s really good.

     Summary: They'll do so with plenty of optimism that they can snap the longest playoff drought (dating back to 2001) in Major League Baseball.
J.P. Crawford and the Mariners have agreed to a five-year, $51 million extension, reports ESPN.
Last season, Crawford hit .273/.338/.376 (102 OPS+) with 169 hits, 37 doubles, nine homers, 54 RBI, 89 runs and 3.8 WAR.
Crawford was a very-good defensive shortstop via metrics like Total Zone runs or Defensive Runs Saved while Statcast's news "outs above average" had him just about league average at the premium defensive position.
The Mariners have had several good seasons in recent years, but always have come up short in making the playoffs.

     Summary: On the television is a baseball game, displaying a different kind of splashing and diving from a Detroit team and a Seattle team.
The other team is the Seattle Mariners, playing their last game of the season, if you could call that playing.
The season began with the team collectively putting up a slash of .245/.319/.421 during spring training.
It was the only game they beat the division-winning Astros, and the only grand slam on the team all season.
By the time Spring Training rolls around, I’m sure I will have reached the acceptance stage of grief.
