     Irishman Lowry vaults into Masters contention
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Irishman, who began the day six shots back of the first-round lead, matched his career-best round at Augusta National with a four-under-par 68 to reach three under at the halfway point of the year's first major.
"I didn't enjoy it really much at all to be honest it was so hard out there," said Lowry.
The 35-year-old Irishman is making his seventh Masters appearance this week at Augusta National, where he has missed the cut three times before and finished in a career-best share of 21st last year.
"Obviously kick-started the round," Lowry said of his birdie at the 10th.
"You're going to need everything to go your way to be standing there getting green on Sunday," said Lowry.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “One of the better rounds of my career,” said Lowry.
“Quite satisfying to do it around this golf course when you need it.” Technically it was Lowry’s third 68 at Augusta, tying his career best in the opening round of 2016 and third round in 2020.
The quartet in second includes past Masters champions Charl Schwartzel (2011) and Hideki Matsuyama (2021), 2020 runner-up Sungjae Im and Lowry, whose best Masters finish was T21 last year.
Lowry, despite his frustration at spitting up a few strokes in Thursday’s opening round, likes his chances in conditions conducive to a former Open champion.
