     What to Expect for Philadelphia Phillies, Oakland Athletics on 2022 MLB Opening Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following an offseason like no other, baseball will be returning to the City of Brotherly Love as the Philadelphia Phillies open their season hosting the Oakland Athletics.
For the Phillies, their lineup got a significant facelift, highlighted by the additions of Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos.
Taking to the mound for the Phillies on Opening Day for the fifth straight time will be Aaron Nola, who will look to get off to a hot start after a lackluster 2021 season.
In spring training, Nola went 0-1 across four starts with an ERA of 5.65, so a win on Opening Day in front of the home crowd could be a huge confidence booster going forward.
For Montas, this will be his second Opening Day start, after opening the season for the Athletics in 2017 against the Los Angeles Angels.

     What’s the opposite of offseason champs? Phillies vs. A’s series preview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At the end of last season, I wasn’t sure if I was going to continue doing these series previews in 2022.
As it turns out, the first series of the year is against one of those franchises that don’t share much history with the Phillies.
For instance, I wasn’t sure Henderson Alvarez III was an actual person until I looked him up and learned that he was actually an All-Star for the Marlins in 2014.
The older set who were A’s fans back in the day would probably switch their allegiances back, but how many Phillies fans would do the same?
Phillies fans have a track record of being bandwagon fans.

     Summary: Here are 10 questions that could determine the path of the Phillies’ season.
When Eflin missed the second half of last season, the Phillies struggled to fill his spot.
Rookie Bryson Stott will be the Phillies’ starting shortstop in 2023 but in the meantime he is blocked by Gregorius, who has one year left on his contract.
Philadelphia Phillies starting pitcher Aaron Nola is set to start in Philadelphia's season opener against the Oakland Atheltics on Friday night.
The right-hander will make his fifth straight Opening Day starter, but Wheeler was the ace of the team last year.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Opening Day is essentially just one game out of 162, it marks the time of year where optimism is at its highest.
Here are a few things to look for on Phillies Opening Day.
With Bryson Stott and Matt Vierling in to replace the injured Mickey Moniak, the Phillies could possibly go left, right, left, right, right, left, right, left, right.
But all of that doesn’t really matter on Opening Day.
Aaron Nola will be making his fifth-consecutive Opening Day start for the Phillies on Friday.

     Summary: As the page turns to the 2022 regular season, the Philadelphia Phillies seem ready to go.
Beyond the long balls, they are plenty of story lines to follow this season.
Like Gregorius, Bohm struggled greatly last year to the point of being sent back to the minor leagues.
Luckily for the Phillies, Domínguez fully recovered, and following some rehab stints in the minors, was activated from the injured list on Sept. 1, 2021.
If everything clicks, the Philadelphia Phillies will certainly be a team to look out for through the regular season and beyond.

     How Using Analytics Helps Optimize the Philadelphia Phillies' Lineup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first rule of which is obvious, a lineup should always put their best hitters near the top.
The is antithetical to the Phillies line-up, their best hitter, Bryce Harper, bats third, which has an out worth a -.315 run value.
The Phillies best hitter is Bryce Harper, he's capable of hitting the most home runs, but he also walks a lot.
Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber are the Phillies' next two best hitters, at least they would have been in 2021.
Using analytics, we've come to a conclusion that the Phillies lineup should look something like this on Opening Day, if Joe Girardi is using data and math to its greatest potential:1.

Seidman: Nick Castellanos' career-high is 101 and I just don't see how that's still his career-high after 2022 (barring injury).
Feeney: Wheeler and Nola both reached this mark last season for the Phillies, so let's go with two again in 2022.
Kane: Harper and Castellanos each hit .309 last season and I expect both to be right around that mark again in 2022.
Feeney: With free agency potentially on the horizon following this season, I'd expect deGrom to be extra cautious in his rehab.
