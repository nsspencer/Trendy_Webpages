    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Obviously, our intent is to have Aaron Judge stay with the New York Yankees as we move forward.
Cashman said the Yankees offered a seven-year, $213.5 million contract offer that would have run from 2023-29.
Instead, Judge will get a one-year contract through salary arbitration.
He filed at $21 million, the Yankees came in at $17 million and the panel must pick one or the either.
Earlier Friday, Judge said he’d be fine emotionally all season long if he has to settle for a one-year contract.

     Summary: That's bad news for the Yankees, Judge and their fans (including Mother Nature).
Brian Cashman announces that there will be no long term extension with Aaron Judge today.
— Lindsey Adler (@lindseyadler) April 8, 2022Without a contract extension, Judge is set to become a free agent following the 2022 season.
"If we're not close by then (Opening Day), what's the point of communicating in the season?," Judge said recently.
Why haven't the Yankees extended Aaron Judge yet?

     Yankees, Aaron Judge can’t reach deal after $213.5 million offer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pageantry of Opening Day in The Bronx on Friday was tempered by there being no contract extension for Aaron Judge.
Brian Cashman said the Yankees offered Judge a deal that was worth an average annual value of $30.5 million over the next seven years for a total of $213.5 million.
That is in addition to either $17 million or $21 million this season, his final year of arbitration, making the sum of the Yankees’ offer eight years for either $230.5 million or $234.5 million.
The $30.5 million AAV would have placed Judge slightly ahead of Mookie Betts’ $30.4 million AAV (in his 12-year, $365 million deal with the Dodgers) and behind only Mike Trout’s $35.54 million AAV (in his 12-year, $426.5 million deal with the Angels) for outfielders all-time.
If it doesn’t get done we’ll work on a one year arbitration deal and move on from there.

     New York Yankees offered Aaron Judge $230 million contract, GM Brian Cashman says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK -- All-Star right fielder Aaron Judge and the New York Yankees did not come to an agreement on a contract extension ahead of the slugger's self-imposed deadline of Opening Day.
General manager Brian Cashman said the team offered a seven-year, $213.5 million extension, which, paired with the $17 million it offered in arbitration this season, would have made the entire package just over $230 million.
"We were unsuccessful in concluding a multiyear pact," Cashman said Friday before the Yankees' season opener vs. the Boston Red Sox.
But it doesn't mean that a conclusion in a positive way for the Yankees and Aaron Judge together in the future can't happen.
I got one year to play, and contract extension stuff is nice, but I got bigger things to focus on."

     Yankees offering huge deal to Aaron Judge with talks going down to the wire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Yankees have bid more than $27.5 million, the annual value of the 10-year, $275 million deal that Alex Rodriguez signed with the team.
The Judge camp could look at the Rodriguez average as archaic since it was agreed to after the 2006 season.
Therefore, the expectation going into this negotiation was that the slugger would shoot not only to be the Yankees’ highest-paid position player ever by annual value, but among the highest-paid players by at least annual value in the sport.
Aaron Judge and the Yankees are still in talks for a long-term extension.
Judge asked for $21 million, the Yankees countered at $17 million.

     Summary: The Yankees were willing to make Judge the second-highest paid outfielder on an average salary in baseball, offering a seven-year, $213.5 million contract extension.
Judge wanted close to the 10-year, $360 million contract extension that center fielder Mike Trout received from the Los Angeles Angels.
Sorry, the Yankees finally told Judge and his representatives, if you want to finish your career with the Yankees, this is a fair offer.
Now, we’ll see this winter if someone is willing to pay it when he hits free agency.
The Yankees and Judge will meet again one more time, but only in an arbitration hearing, with the Yankees offering $17 million while Judge countered with $21 million.

\"I never thought in my life I'd be in that opportunity, and it's not something that's guaranteed.
Judge has said that he and Odle would not negotiate with the Yankees during the season, believing that doing so would be a distraction.
\"We've got so many things to focus on, a lot of good things happening,\" Judge said.
But passing on the extension represents a significant gamble for Judge, who played in 242 of a possible 384 regular season games from 2018-20 due to various injuries.
