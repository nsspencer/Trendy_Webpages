     Dodgers: Longtime LA GM Officially Retires from Baseball
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former general manager Ned Colletti is no exception.
Colletti served as the Dodgers general manager from late 2005 to late 2014.
However, he might be best known for another big trade with Boston.
Yesterday, the former general manager announced that he is officially stepping away from the sport of baseball in a professional capacity.
As the adage goes, sometimes the best moves general managers make is the moves they don't make.

     Former GM And SportsNet LA Analyst Ned Colletti Wishes Farewell To Dodgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers hired Ned Colletti as their general manager in 2005 and he has been with the organization ever since, all the while becoming a key figure in the franchise’s history.
But now, Colletti is moving on from the Dodgers, and wished a farewell to the fans and organization after being in L.A. for 17 years.
He reached 500 victories as a GM in 2011, accomplishing the feat in 953 games, which was faster than every general manager in Dodgers franchise history besides Buzzie Bavasi (895 games).
Colletti then transitioned to a role as the senior advisor to Dodgers president and CEO Stan Kasten, while additionally contributing as an analyst for SportsNet LA as well.
After the ceremony, the 37-year-old took to Twitter to congratulate Colletti and thanked him for bringing him to the Dodgers.

     Dodgers Dugout: Here’s why the Dodgers will win the division
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jack covered the Angels last season, and what better way to introduce him to you than with a Q&amp;A about this season’s team?
Given the way last year played out, it’s easy to understand why the Dodgers are approaching the season that way.
Last season I thought the Dodgers would win the division easily.
But despite the questions, their offense and bullpen will be enough to win the division.
How many games will the Dodgers win this season?
