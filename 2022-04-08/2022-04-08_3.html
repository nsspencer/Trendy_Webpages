     Dodgers: Longtime LA GM Officially Retires from Baseball

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former general manager Ned Colletti is no exception.
Colletti served as the Dodgers general manager from late 2005 to late 2014.
However, he might be best known for another big trade with Boston.
Yesterday, the former general manager announced that he is officially stepping away from the sport of baseball in a professional capacity.
As the adage goes, sometimes the best moves general managers make is the moves they don't make.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Walker Buehler will get the ball for his first Opening Day start and will be taking on Colorado’s Kyle Freeland.
Up until now, Dave Roberts and the Dodgers have been unwilling to announce who would be going after Walker.
The assumption was that it would be some combination of Clayton Kershaw and Julio Urias over the weekend.
So their Opening weekend rotation is officially set, and it does not include Clayton Kershaw.
But regardless, we have our first weekend rotation!

     Former GM And SportsNet LA Analyst Ned Colletti Wishes Farewell To Dodgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers hired Ned Colletti as their general manager in 2005 and he has been with the organization ever since, all the while becoming a key figure in the franchise’s history.
But now, Colletti is moving on from the Dodgers, and wished a farewell to the fans and organization after being in L.A. for 17 years.
He reached 500 victories as a GM in 2011, accomplishing the feat in 953 games, which was faster than every general manager in Dodgers franchise history besides Buzzie Bavasi (895 games).
Colletti then transitioned to a role as the senior advisor to Dodgers president and CEO Stan Kasten, while additionally contributing as an analyst for SportsNet LA as well.
After the ceremony, the 37-year-old took to Twitter to congratulate Colletti and thanked him for bringing him to the Dodgers.

     Freddie Freeman bats second in first Dodgers lineup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Freddie Freeman in his first starting lineup with the Dodgers bats second, a role he’s become more accustomed to in the last two years.
Freeman starts at first base against the Rockies on Friday afternoon at Coors Field in Denver.
In 2021, Freeman went back to batting third until leadoff man Ronald Acuña Jr. got hurt, then shifted back to second.
This spring with the Dodgers, Freeman batted second in eight of his nine games, putting a left-handed bat between right-handers Mookie Betts at leadoff and Trea Turner batting third.
This is the seventh opening day start for Justin Turner, whose first game with the Dodgers in 2014 was a start at second base in Sydney, Australia.
