     Summary: PHILADELPHIA - Kyle Schwarber’s first Phillies’ at-bat, home run and curtain call all came in the bottom of the first inning of the Phillies’ 9-5 Opening Day victory over the Oakland A’s.
I couldn’t write it any better, I guess, for myself,” said Schwarber, who went 2-for-4 with a walk and two runs scored.. “It was a great team win.
“It was a little early curtain call, a really exciting moment.
“My heart rate was going about 150 miles an hour, I don’t know why I did that, I just did it,” said Schwarber.
To be here on the home side and be able to play for (the Phillies fans) is special.”The Phillies thought what they saw out of Schwarber was pretty special as well.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More than 30 relatives showed up for Bryson Stott's Major League debut for the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday afternoon at Citizens Bank Park.
More than anything, the Stott family was proud of what Bryson accomplished, not just during his debut, but getting there in the first place.
Little did Bryson know, just a year later, he'd rocket all the way up through the Phillies minor league system to that same stadium.
There, against the top prospects in the game, Stott continued to hit, earning himself an invite to Major League spring training in 2022.
By the time the lockout was lifted March 10, Stott had a head-start on his Major League teammates.

     Summary: “I like him.”So did Phillies fans on opening day.
“But it was a real exciting moment.”Harper lobbied hard for the Phillies to sign Schwarber and they gave the outfielder a $79 million, four-year contract.
Harper also gave stump speeches — “four phone calls a day," according to their shared agent — for the Phillies to sign Nick Castellanos.
Nola, the 2018 All-Star who went 9-9 with a 4.63 ERA last season, made his fifth straight opening day start.
The home run Liberty Bell had been on the fritz the last few seasons but was repaired in time for opening day.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I also expect the Braves to take a half-step back this season off of a title and without Freddie Freeman.
Seidman: Nick Castellanos' career-high is 101 and I just don't see how that's still his career-high after 2022 (barring injury).
Feeney: Wheeler and Nola both reached this mark last season for the Phillies, so let's go with two again in 2022.
Kane: Harper and Castellanos each hit .309 last season and I expect both to be right around that mark again in 2022.
Feeney: With free agency potentially on the horizon following this season, I'd expect deGrom to be extra cautious in his rehab.

     MLB Opening Day: Phillies' Kyle Schwarber crushes leadoff home run in first at-bat with Philadelphia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During Opening Day each season, I get a heightened sense of enjoyment watching each team's leadoff hitter.
It actually worked in 2017, when George Springer homered for the Astros and then they won it all that year.
Schwarber suffered a hamstring injury last season, but he had the best year of his career.
He set career highs in 2019 with 38 homers and 92 RBI, too, so he's been trending well for a bit.
The Phillies also added free-agent slugger Nick Castellanos in free agency, giving a lineup that already had Bryce Harper, J.T.

     Summary: After a rainy few days in Philadelphia, the sun was shining on Citizens Bank Park as the Phillies opened their season against the Athletics.
Aaron Nola got the start on the bump, cruising through the first inning before the Phillies’ offense began to flex its muscle.
Luckily for the Phillies, their offense is more than capable of getting runs back quickly and that’s what they did in their half of the seventh.
Seranthony Dominguez, finally healthy, had an excellent 1-2-3 eighth inning, bringing the Phillies up again for more insurance runs.
Bryson Stott with a RBI double to give the Phillies a 8-5 lead!
