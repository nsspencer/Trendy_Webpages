     Phillies Dominate Athletics on Opening Day as Slugfest Ensued
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At long last, the Philadelphia Phillies resumed playing baseball as 2022 MLB Opening Day was played on Friday.
The Phillies hosted the Oakland Athletics while also sporting their new look lineup and Aaron Nola taking the bump for the fifth consecutive year.
It was an incredibly productive inning of baseball for this Phillies lineup as they lived up to exactly what they were built to do.
After giving up a three-run home run, which cut the Phillies lead to 6-4, he was yanked from the game for Jeurys Familia.
As we have said all offseason, this Phillies lineup has the firepower to outhit bad defense and poor pitching.

     Summary: It took Phillies fans seven pitches to fall in love with Kyle Schwarber.
In addition to his leadoff homer, which came on a 3-2 pitch from Oakland starter Frankie Montas, Schwarber walked and singled home a run in five trips to the plate.
The leadoff homer electrified the ballpark.
We got a lot of big hits with runners in scoring position."

     Phillies predictions 2022: Bryce Harper, Nick Castellanos, Kyle Schwarber and more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I also expect the Braves to take a half-step back this season off of a title and without Freddie Freeman.
Seidman: Nick Castellanos' career-high is 101 and I just don't see how that's still his career-high after 2022 (barring injury).
Feeney: Wheeler and Nola both reached this mark last season for the Phillies, so let's go with two again in 2022.
Kane: Harper and Castellanos each hit .309 last season and I expect both to be right around that mark again in 2022.
Feeney: With free agency potentially on the horizon following this season, I'd expect deGrom to be extra cautious in his rehab.

     Summary: After a rainy few days in Philadelphia, the sun was shining on Citizens Bank Park as the Phillies opened their season against the Athletics.
Aaron Nola got the start on the bump, cruising through the first inning before the Phillies’ offense began to flex its muscle.
Luckily for the Phillies, their offense is more than capable of getting runs back quickly and that’s what they did in their half of the seventh.
Seranthony Dominguez, finally healthy, had an excellent 1-2-3 eighth inning, bringing the Phillies up again for more insurance runs.
Bryson Stott with a RBI double to give the Phillies a 8-5 lead!

     Summary: PHILADELPHIA - Kyle Schwarber’s first Phillies’ at-bat, home run and curtain call all came in the bottom of the first inning of the Phillies’ 9-5 Opening Day victory over the Oakland A’s.
I couldn’t write it any better, I guess, for myself,” said Schwarber, who went 2-for-4 with a walk and two runs scored.. “It was a great team win.
“It was a little early curtain call, a really exciting moment.
“My heart rate was going about 150 miles an hour, I don’t know why I did that, I just did it,” said Schwarber.
To be here on the home side and be able to play for (the Phillies fans) is special.”The Phillies thought what they saw out of Schwarber was pretty special as well.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During Opening Day each season, I get a heightened sense of enjoyment watching each team's leadoff hitter.
It actually worked in 2017, when George Springer homered for the Astros and then they won it all that year.
Schwarber suffered a hamstring injury last season, but he had the best year of his career.
He set career highs in 2019 with 38 homers and 92 RBI, too, so he's been trending well for a bit.
The Phillies also added free-agent slugger Nick Castellanos in free agency, giving a lineup that already had Bryce Harper, J.T.

     Summary: As the page turns to the 2022 regular season, the Philadelphia Phillies seem ready to go.
Beyond the long balls, they are plenty of story lines to follow this season.
Like Gregorius, Bohm struggled greatly last year to the point of being sent back to the minor leagues.
Luckily for the Phillies, Domínguez fully recovered, and following some rehab stints in the minors, was activated from the injured list on Sept. 1, 2021.
If everything clicks, the Philadelphia Phillies will certainly be a team to look out for through the regular season and beyond.

     Summary: “I like him.”So did Phillies fans on opening day.
Reigning NL MVP Bryce Harper also knocked in a run and Aaron Nola struck out seven to lead the Philadelphia Phillies to a 9-5 win over the Oakland Athletics on Friday.
Harper also gave stump speeches — “four phone calls a day," according to their shared agent — for the Phillies to sign Nick Castellanos.
Nola, the 2018 All-Star who went 9-9 with a 4.63 ERA last season, made his fifth straight opening day start.
The home run Liberty Bell had been on the fritz the last few seasons but was repaired in time for opening day.
