     Ready to Start: Setting The Table For The 2022 Texas Rangers Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s not particularly enjoyable in the moment to watch a bad baseball team, and despite the considerable strides they’ve taken this offseason, the Rangers will be much closer to bad than good in 2022.
Enduring the teething of a young rotation, the potholes in a half-paved lineup, the chaos of a bric-a-brac bullpen—that’s painful, arduous work over seven months.
That makes for a bad team in the present tense.
Before you know it, the bad baseball team will become an OK one, then a good one.
Which is how bad baseball, played by a team on the cusp of great baseball, becomes special.

For optimism, the Rangers have a good track record of signing veteran pitchers and helping them get to another level.
The duo will strengthen the Rangers' bullpen as Hernández established himself as a dominant reliever in 2020 and Leclerc has previous success as the closer in Texas.
