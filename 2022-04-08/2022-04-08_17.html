     Summary: One of the reasons fans love Klay is because of his sense of humor.
And Thompson's activities during the press conference last night are a great example of that.
After the Los Angeles Lakers lost to the Golden State Warriors, Klay Thompson spoke to the media in his post-game press conference.
During the press conference, Thompson could be seen folding a paper airplane.
As the press conference wrapped up, Klay threw the airplane in the air but was shocked to see it make a U-turn and not go far.

     Warriors-Lakes score: Klay Thompson goes off in Warriors' win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — As Klay Thompson started to write his redemption story in January, the five-time All-Star knew it wasn’t going to be easy.
But 31 games into his return and with the playoffs on the horizon, Thompson said he is finally starting to feel like himself again.
Thompson led the Warriors to a 128-112 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, who were without LeBron James, Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis.
It wasn’t his biggest scoring performance of the season, though coach Steve Kerr called it Thompson’s “best game” yet.
“In the playoffs your best players have to perform, and I really like where Klay is now,” Kerr said.

     Warriors' Klay Thompson nearing scoring milestone as season ends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Warriors' offense started slow and stagnant against the Los Angeles Lakers' backup squad, Thompson provided needed points Thursday night at Chase Center.
His latest scoring outbursts have raised his points per game average to 19.7 through 31 games -- just off the magic number.
Since making his return on Jan. 9 earlier this year, Klay hasn't played in both games of a back-to-back.
Kerr typically has played Thompson to open a back-to-back but said Thursday that the plan still is to be determined.
Thompson's first game this season came three days after the Warriors last played the Pelicans.
