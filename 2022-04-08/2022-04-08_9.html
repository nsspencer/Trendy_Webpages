     Masters 2022: The superstition that Harold Varner III has working so far at Augusta
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though he is playing in his first Masters, Harold Varner III has looked nothing like a nervous rookie.
On Friday, he posted his second-straight one-under 71 at Augusta National Golf Club, and his two-under 142 total put him into contention heading into the weekend.
Winner earlier this year at the Saudi International, which propelled him into the top 50 in the World Ranking and a Masters invite, Varner appears so relaxed that you wouldn’t know that he is playing in just his ninth major at age 31.

     Summary: Harold Varner III might owe Michael Jordan a few more strokes the next time they play golf together.
“He said, since I haven’t won, I’ve got to give him eight shots,” said Varner, a Jordan Brand athlete.
Varner got the chance to visit Butler Cabin on Friday afternoon for a post-round interview with ESPN’s Scott Van Pelt.

     Summary: He made a 90-foot bomb for eagle on the final hole to win the Saudi International earlier this year.
“You’re not going to hit it to the right and have a good shot to chip it in,” he said.
Like, every time I play, I feel like I’m getting close and I’m going to build on that.
Eventually, I’ll break through.”Growing up, Varner practiced with the goal of making the winning putt in the U.S. Open, but winning the Masters will do just fine.
“I think about (winning the Masters) all the time,” he said.

     Column: Faint signs of progress at the home of the Masters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's believed to be the first time that three Black golfers — in this case, Varner, Tiger Woods and Cameron Champ — have been part of a Masters field.
A quarter-century removed from Woods' historic first Masters victory, there are still far too few Black players in golf's pipeline.
Varner hopes that his Masters debut will help to break down some of those barriers.
But, for now at least, we'll have to be content with the faint signs of progress that will be on display this weekend at the Masters.
Never before have kids of color had so many players they could relate to at Augusta National.

     Masters rookie Harold Varner III holding his own after two rounds at windy Augusta National

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AUGUSTA, Ga. — Harold Varner III isn’t going to let the big stage of the Masters get in the way of him having fun at Augusta National Golf Club.
Moving from Ohio as a youngster to Gastonia with his family Varner has grown up around the game thanks to his grandfather and his father.
Varner says there’s no way he’s about to have a sour attitude about the game.
As expected there were plenty of East Carolina backers among the patrons, including one from nearby Fort Gordon.
Chris Allen, 44, is a communications specialist in the Army who graduated from East Carolina in 2006.
