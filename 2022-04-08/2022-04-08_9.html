    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors was out of the NBA for years due to a horrible injury but he‚Äôs been back for a few months now.
Some people thought that it would take some time for Thompson to play like his old self again.

     Summary: One of the reasons fans love Klay is because of his sense of humor.
And Thompson's activities during the press conference last night are a great example of that.
After the Los Angeles Lakers lost to the Golden State Warriors, Klay Thompson spoke to the media in his post-game press conference.
During the press conference, Thompson could be seen folding a paper airplane.
As the press conference wrapped up, Klay threw the airplane in the air but was shocked to see it make a U-turn and not go far.

     Summary: As the Warriors' offense started slow and stagnant against the Los Angeles Lakers' backup squad, Thompson provided needed points Thursday night at Chase Center.
His latest scoring outbursts have raised his points per game average to 19.7 through 31 games -- just off the magic number.
Since making his return on Jan. 9 earlier this year, Klay hasn't played in both games of a back-to-back.
Kerr typically has played Thompson to open a back-to-back but said Thursday that the plan still is to be determined.
Thompson's first game this season came three days after the Warriors last played the Pelicans.

     Encouraging signs of Klay Thompson rounding into form as the playoffs approach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kent Bazemore defends him topside to deny him shooting space on the catch, and Thompson responds by curling around the down-screen and attacking Bazemore‚Äôs overplay.
Thompson‚Äôs ability to defend quicker perimeter operators has been a mixed bag overall, but him slowly regaining his old form has also translated to a much better time keeping up in terms of lateral movement.
Expect Thompson‚Äôs ability to switch onto smaller and quicker guards to be better in the coming days.
Of course, the core of Thompson‚Äôs value will always be his ability to knock down shots from beyond the arc.
When the Warriors finally do get to add Stephen Curry to this version of Thompson, the offense is bound for an explosion.
