     Behold a squirming Mitch McConnell try to defend his indefensible position on Trump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In terms of sheer legislative influence, there are few — if any — characters in the recent history of American politics with more impact than Mitch McConnell.
That he is ruthless and unscrupulous and utterly impossible to shame makes him the most potent force for conservative legislation in a generation.
There, a conspicuously flustered McConnell sputtered and deflected when asked about his “moral red lines” in regards to his infamously cutthroat style of politics.
Ultimately, I suppose, the fact that McConnell won’t — and in all likelihood can’t — define his moral red lines doesn’t make much of a difference.
He knows he doesn’t really have a moral red line, and he knows that the people who keep him in power don’t care one iota if he does or doesn’t to begin with.

     Summary: McConnell spoke with Jonathan Swan at Axios while Trump was questioned by Josh Dawsey of the Washington Post.
Underneath it all Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump are the same: ruthless, self-serving, power-hungry brutes.
Trump's primitive thirst for revenge against anyone who crosses him is actually much easier to understand than that evasive, non-response from McConnell.
But McConnell still has the sense that people might think there is something wrong with being an amoral monster so he obfuscates.

     Analysis: Mitch McConnell just moved the goalposts -- again -- on Supreme Court nominees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That came after an interview McConnell did with Axios' Jonathan Swan Thursday morning , in which he declined to commit to holding hearings for a potential Supreme Court nominee if he became the Senate majority leader next year.
To be clear, what McConnell is saying is that he won't pledge to consider a nominee to fill a Supreme Court opening in the final two years of President Joe Biden's term.
"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice," McConnell said at the time.
In announcing his selection of Garland, Obama nodded to this moderation.
It's worth noting here that there were no Supreme Court vacancies at the time Biden delivered his remarks.
