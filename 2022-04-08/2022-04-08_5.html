     Jack White delivers searing national anthem at Detroit Tigers' Opening Day game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wielding his iconic “Seven Nation Army” guitar, Jack White delivered an unconventional sort of “Star-Spangled Banner” to kick off Detroit Tigers festivities at Comerica Park on Friday.
The Detroit native and lifelong baseball fan was invited to perform the national anthem for the Tigers’ Opening Day game against the Chicago White Sox.
White led the song, playing slide on his vintage Kay Archtop guitar — the same one he has used on some of his best-known work.
Their performance was followed by a flyover of four Thunderbolt Warthog planes from the Selfridge Air National Guard’s 107th Fighter Squadron.
In a recent Spin magazine feature, White said he’s confident about the upcoming Tigers season and is convinced the team has finally found its footing.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A year ago, the Tigers played winning baseball in the second half, putting together an impressive 37-34 record, and this year’s roster is even better.
Mize, a right-hander, posted a 3.71 ERA last season and paced the Tigers in games (30) and innings pitched (150⅓).
Greene arguably had the better season of the two in the minors last year, but it’s still a big jump to the big leagues.
Even with his potential two-month setback, Greene will have a better season based on averages and projections once he gets called up.
