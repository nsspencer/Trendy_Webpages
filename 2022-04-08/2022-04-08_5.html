     Adam Scott on That Severance Cliff-Hanger: “I Know It’s Cruel and Unusual”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Adam Scott, a devoted sci-fi fan who also happens to star in the show, the parallels are pretty clear too—especially when it comes to the brutal cliff-hanger that ends the season.
(The audience was told this a few episodes ago, in yet another wicked cliff-hanger.)
“I know it’s in some ways cruel and unusual, but I also think it’s just so much fun to be watching something and have that feeling.
I hadn’t, but went back to hear it—the ding of the elevator on the Lumon severed floor.
But Severance fans have one more thing to ponder in the interminable wait for season two.

     Severance’s first season is a wonderfully tense workplace horror story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite the veneer of a banal workplace drama, Severance is an incredibly tense sci-fi horror series where that tension only builds over the course of the show’s nine episodes.
This allows people to essentially skip work for eight hours a day and focus on their outside life.
The work self, meanwhile (the two are colloquially referred to as “innies” and “outies”), is stuck in a life that is nothing but work.
I should also note that Severance’s creators have a clear love of artful cliffhangers of the “Not Penny’s boat” variety.
The first season of Severance is stressful, but it’s also a lot more fun than a Lumon-allocated Music Dance Experience.

Helly meets Gabby — the mom who didn’t remember Devon — and her politician husband Angelo, who’s eager to vote in favor of severance.

     ‘Severance’ Finale: A Series Redefining Cliffhanger Turns Everything on Its Head
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s a series that absolutely works, which makes it all the more daring that its season-ending cliffhanger has turned it entirely on its head.
The season finale has blown up the world of Severance to the extent that it will have to return as a very different show.
But Innie Mark knows none of this, and has only about an hour to work it all out.
Will the series continue to follow Helena in the outside world, giving the audience a firsthand view of the Lumon machine?
And what of Irving, who used his short window in the outside world to seek out his lost love Burt (Christopher Walken)?

     Review: ‘Severance’ Season One – A Head-splitter of an Entrance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The show discussions on the subreddit have been incredible and as of this writing, Variety has confirmed that it will be renewed for a second season.
With that out of the way, here are my thoughts (and some spoilers) on Severance.
Now, that’s JUST the data refinement team, we meet Christopher Walken’s Burt as Head of the Optics and Design department.
Away (but not really) from Lumon, Mark is disconnected from everything and everyone, his sister being the only person left after his wife’s passing.
Granted, I do want to spend more time with Lumon and the Data Refinement team, I am indeed curious as to what Lumon really does and the answers to many questions.

Apple TV PlusWhat about when he calls Ms. Cobel, who Outtie Mark thinks is Ms. Selvig, Ms. Cobel?
To put him in this position where the Innie Mark, we’re starting to root for him and Helly, but now we also want to root for Outtie Mark to find his wife.
And so this is all happening at an interesting time for Outtie Mark, as well.

     ‘Severance’: A Theory About Kier Eagan and Lumon Industries
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And, taking a step back, how does the MDR team fit into what Cobel, Milchick, and the Lumon board have been doing?
That transference of consciousness and the manipulation of people’s bodies is what I think Lumon has been working on this whole time with the severance procedure, with the end goal of bringing Kier Eagan back to life.
The Lumon board refuses to believe Cobel’s fear, as seen in Petey, that severance could be reversed — because if so, then their plan for Kier might fail?
Maybe I’m taking a leap forward in interpreting lines like Mark’s “We’re people, not parts of people” and Helena’s “I don’t think severance divides us.
Maybe the second season of Severance is about the person sent there next in order to help Kier come back.
