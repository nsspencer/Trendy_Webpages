     A look at the marvelous career of Michelle Yeoh
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hollywood has too many sins to list—not least how swiftly it discards women the minute they sprout a single grey hair.
That's why I'm so intrigued by A24's multi-dimensional epic Everything Everywhere All At Once, starring Michelle Yeoh.
It feels like I'm in another dimension just writing that sentence.
The 80s Hong Kong cinema legend owns one of the most compelling filmographies in history.
GQ sits down with Yeoh in the video embedded above and talks about her most iconic characters.

     'Everything Everywhere All at Once' is the mind-bending metaverse movie you didn't know you needed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Strange, surreal and unexpectedly sentimental, "Everything Everywhere All at Once" is genuinely and wildly original -- the kung fu/science fiction/metaphysical action comedy that you didn't know you needed, but just might love.
"Might" does a lot of work there, because while the film will have its well-deserved admirers, the dizzying nature of it won't be for everyone.
On the plus, it would be hard to spoil a movie that moves at this sort of frenetic pace, and that works from the Marvel-esque conceit that there is a multiverse of infinite possibilities, with different universes created by the different choices that we make along the way.
Moreover, each time she accesses one of the other universes she acquires the skills that she developed there, which given the dangers and Yeoh's martial-arts background, certainly comes in handy.
This isn't the kind of movie one would necessarily seek out for a deep contemplation of roads not taken, "dreams you never followed" and achieving serenity with one's choices, but that's certainly one of the universes that "Everything Everywhere" occupies.

     Summary: The buddy cop film — starring two females, Michelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock (left), somewhat of a first — was just Yeoh's second feature.
"The first hurdle I had to go through was the guys accepting me to the boys' club," she told The Hollywood Reporter.
She joined the stuntmen at the gym, asking them to teach her their ways.
"I think it was quite refreshing for them," she added.
"Humility goes a long way."

     What younger Asian actors tell Michelle Yeoh: ‘Finally, I can see myself’

     Summary: Michelle Yeoh is everywhere.
“What [is special about] this moment in my career is having so many people who look like me, especially the younger generation [of Asian actors], come up to me and say, ‘Finally, I can see myself doing all these kinds of things because you are doing it,’” Yeoh told People magazine in an interview published Thursday.
By a strange twist of fate, Evelyn is soon transported into various parallel universes occupied by different, powerful versions of herself.
After premiering at the SXSW Film Festival, the genre-bending fantasy has received a 97% rating on review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.
“I have to appreciate the ride I’ve been on,” Yeoh told People.

When I read the script, I thought, “There’s no way I’m going to do this ‘hotdog fingers’ thing.
In the movie I’m doing now, my character’s name is Paul.
You can’t know what you’re going to do in the space with the cameras until you’re there.
But I’m going to have to find a way to distract her when Stephanie is flinging the dildos around.

     Michelle Yeoh Conquers the Universe(s)
    </h2>

     Summary: Somewhere, in one of the gajillion strands of the cat’s cradle of multiverses, there is a world in which Michelle Yeoh does not start ballet lessons at the age of four.
He’s dining with a good friend of the then-21-year-old Michelle Yeoh, who had been reluctantly entered into a beauty contest by her mom and walked away with the title of Miss Malaysia.
By the time the producers of Tomorrow Never Dies, the 1997 James Bond film, came calling, Yeoh was ready to return.
Yeoh does not even need to get up to demonstrate.
“It’s ‘Michelle Wong, Michelle Yeoh…Michelle Wong, Michelle Yeoh.’ I pictured someone in audience sitting in the theater, someone on screen yells ‘Michelle,’ I turn around and the first thing they think is, ‘My god, why does Michelle Yeoh look so old!?
