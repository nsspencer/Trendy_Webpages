     All the Old Knives movie review (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This failed and all 120 people on board, terrorists and hostages alike, were killed.
Now, new information has come to light suggesting there was a mole in the office who may have secretly provided information to the terrorists.
The film then uses parallel timelines, cutting between the current conversation between Henry and Celia and extended flashbacks showing what they were doing during the crisis.
The early set-up scenes are reasonably intriguing but at a certain point, things just stop working.
Another is that the big center mystery proves to be not much of anything—at a certain point, it becomes fairly obvious what the answer is and when all is finally revealed, the revelation and subsequent explanation is somewhat of a letdown.

     All the Old Knives Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All the Old Knives is now streaming on Prime Video.
Just over eight years ago, Chris Pine starred in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit , yet another in Paramount’s long line of attempts to reboot Tom Clancy’s everyman superspy.
Based on ​​Olen Steinhauer’s 2015 novel of the same name, All the Old Knives harks back to the espionage potboilers of an earlier era, evoking (in ambition if not execution) John Le Carre’s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy or The Tailor of Panama .
Thus, he and Celia reconnect eight years after the hijacking, with their passion for each other still simmering just under the surface… but it’s not long before those old knives start to come out.
LoadingThere’s an air of melancholy methodically woven into All the Old Knives.

     All the Old Knives: Spycraft and romance swirl in espionage thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The film takes place in two time periods, separated by six years.
“All the Old Knives” is an engaging cat-and-mouse game expertly shot and performed.
While the lack of traditional, large-scale, conventionally thrilling action sequences might not appeal to broad audiences, “All the Old Knives” capably replaces overt physical excitement with anxious conversation.
Therefore, it is perfectly logical that the dinner between Celia and Pelham takes place in an empty restaurant on a slow weekday.
“All the Old Knives” embraces COVID limitations, whether they were a necessity or always a part of the story.

     Review: Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton bring restrained passion to ‘All the Old Knives’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Secrets, score settling, grudge holding, deception and recriminations are, of course, the stuff of international espionage.
All of which is to say international espionage and romantic entanglements both revolve around the essential unknowability of other people.
Such is the aim of “All the Old Knives,” a cerebral thriller with an elegant sensibility directed by Janus Metz from a screenplay by Olen Steinhauer adapting his own novel.
Director Metz previously made the tennis-world psychodrama “Borg vs. McEnroe,” a fitting connection as “All the Old Knives” is rooted in the back-and-forth volleys of its two main characters.
“All The Old Knives” comes out right after “The Contractor,” which also stars Pine and had ambitions to merge a domestic drama with an action thriller, shades of Robert Ludlum akin to “Old Knives’” nods to John Le Carré.

While All The Old Knives is a fairly cut-and-paste spy story, it actually does satisfy on the eroticism front.
All The Old Knives attempts to convince its audiences that it is a tawdry game of chess, but in reality, it’s a game of checkers.
