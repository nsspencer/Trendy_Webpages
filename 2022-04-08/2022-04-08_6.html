"I'm super excited.
After a shaky start to his 2021 season, Webb caught fire in the second half, finishing the season as the Giants' ace.

     What's that thing on Joey Bart's arm? An explainer on how the SF Giants are using PitchCom on Opening Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants are one of the reportedly-about-half of MLB squads that will be trying out a device known as PitchCom.
Prior to this, the Giants’ new starting catcher, Joey Bart, would have used his fingers to signal what pitch he wanted Opening Day starter Logan Webb to throw his way.
Instead, Bart will press one of the 81 combinations of buttons on the PitchCom device on his wrist to send that message to Webb.
The catcher said Thursday he intends to use the technology with nearly all of the Giants’ pitching staff.
This doesn’t change the fact that pitchers can still reject pitch suggestions with the famous shake of the head while on the mound, nor does it mean catchers can’t revert to finger signals if a pitcher spends a lot of time rejecting pitch suggestions.

     SF Giants' Joey Bart hits first career homer on Opening Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — In Joey Bart’s first audition as the Giants’ starting catcher, he came to the plate 111 times and didn’t trot around the bases once.
So in his second plate appearance of the official start of his tenure, Bart took time to admire the ball that launched off his bat.
When it landed about a dozen rows up in the left-field bleachers, 414 feet away from home plate, the 25-year-old catcher had notched his first career homer and extended the Giants’ lead to 3-0.
Prior to Bart, the last Giants rookie to hit his first career homer on Opening Day was Will Clark, who homered in his first career major league at-bat off Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan in 1986.
By getting the nod behind the plate on Opening Day, Bart gave the Giants a homegrown battery as he caught Logan Webb, another product of the Giants’ drafting and development.

This is his 12th season in a Giants uniform, and Friday was the 11th time he’s been on an Opening Day roster.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: La Stella and the Giants discussed carrying him as a designated hitter but decided to play it safe instead.
“It was always up in the air, so we understood this was a realistic possibility,” La Stella said.
But after a follow-up consultation last week with Dr. Robert Anderson, who performed the operation, La Stella isn’t concerned.
“There’s always scar tissue elements of this that there’s really nothing other than just breaking through it, and that can take time,” La Stella said.
Wade almost certainly would have found a spot in the Opening Day lineup against Marlins right-hander Sandy Alcantara but will be forced to watch from the dugout, alongside La Stella and Longoria.

     SF Giants: Logan Webb realizes potential with Opening Day start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — When Logan Webb takes the mound Friday afternoon, at 25 years old, he’ll become the Giants’ youngest Opening Day starter in more than a decade, a homegrown product with a dozen family members in the stands.
Last year’s Opening Day starter, Kevin Gausman, served as the 2021 staff’s spiritual leader.
But last season, Webb reduced the walk rate to one every 4.1 innings while getting more strikeouts than he ever had before.
Webb had every right to presume that the Opening Day nod was his.
He’ll be the youngest Opening Day starter since Lincecum, at 24, in 2009.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was Slater’s first career walk-off hit and the Giants’ first walk-off victory on Opening Day since 1987 against the San Diego Padres.
Prior to the dramatic ninth inning, Giants starting pitcher Logan Webb didn’t allow a run in six innings and battery mate Joey Bart hit his first career home run.
Picking up right where he left off last season, Webb threw 85 pitches, allowed just five hits, and struck out three.
That allowed Bart to score from first base for a 1-0 Giants lead.
Belt made an unforgettable entrance to Oracle Park – one only a self-proclaimed captain can make – as part of the Giants’ elaborate Opening Day festivities.
