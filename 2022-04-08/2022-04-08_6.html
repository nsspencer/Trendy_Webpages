     Jake Burger makes presence felt early for White Sox
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DETROIT — Jake Burger was with Triple-A Charlotte when he got a phone call Wednesday as it became apparent Yoan Moncada (oblique strain) was headed to the IL.
“It’s crazy,” Burger said Friday morning before starting at third base for the White Sox against the Tigers on Opening Day.
“We opened up in Norfolk [Tuesday], and how many guys can say they played Triple-A Opening day and then MLB Opening Day in the same year?
He just arrived in Arizona, where he’ll face hitters before going to Triple-A Charlotte and likely ramp up with four or five outings.
Moncada’s expected return from his oblique strain is three weeks the Sox say, and that includes getting at-bats in games at Charlotte.
