     Yankees, Aaron Judge will reportedly not reach contract agreement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Judge’s contract extension deadline with the Yankees is set before the team’s first pitch on Friday at 1:05 p.m.
However, ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported on Friday morning that the right fielder and the team will likely not reach an agreement before the deadline.
This update comes soon after it was reported that Judge’s offered contract would set the Yankees franchise record for a position player if agreed upon, according to reports from multiple MLB insiders.
The contract details are not yet official, but the offer includes a multi-year deal that could reach up to $225 million.
The record deal for a Yankees player is currently pitcher Gerrit Cole, who earns around $36 million per year on his nine-year, $324 million contract.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Obviously, our intent is to have Aaron Judge stay with the New York Yankees as we move forward.
Cashman said the Yankees offered a seven-year, $213.5 million contract offer that would have run from 2023-29.
Instead, Judge will get a one-year contract through salary arbitration.
He filed at $21 million, the Yankees came in at $17 million and the panel must pick one or the either.
Earlier Friday, Judge said he’d be fine emotionally all season long if he has to settle for a one-year contract.

     Yankees offering huge deal to Aaron Judge with talks going down to the wire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Yankees have bid more than $27.5 million, the annual value of the 10-year, $275 million deal that Alex Rodriguez signed with the team.
The Judge camp could look at the Rodriguez average as archaic since it was agreed to after the 2006 season.
Therefore, the expectation going into this negotiation was that the slugger would shoot not only to be the Yankees’ highest-paid position player ever by annual value, but among the highest-paid players by at least annual value in the sport.
Aaron Judge and the Yankees are still in talks for a long-term extension.
Judge asked for $21 million, the Yankees countered at $17 million.

     Aaron Judge extension: GM Brian Cashman confirms no deal prior to deadline, Yankees offered over $200 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK -- The New York Yankees failed to reach a long-term contract extension with star right fielder Aaron Judge prior to his Opening Day deadline, general manager Brian Cashman confirmed Friday.
"We're all disappointed right now that we can't be talking about a contract extension today.
The team's $17 million salary plus the extension would equal eight years and $230.5 million total.
For the Yankees, Judge is their best and most marketable player, a player whose value to the franchise transcends his on-field performance.
The Judge extension would have tied up approximately $110 million per year in only five players through 2025.

     Summary: NEW YORK -- All-Star right fielder Aaron Judge and the New York Yankees did not come to an agreement on a contract extension ahead of the slugger's self-imposed deadline of Opening Day.
General manager Brian Cashman said the team offered a seven-year, $213.5 million extension, which, paired with the $17 million it offered in arbitration this season, would have made the entire package just over $230 million.
"We were unsuccessful in concluding a multiyear pact," Cashman said Friday before the Yankees' season opener vs. the Boston Red Sox.
But it doesn't mean that a conclusion in a positive way for the Yankees and Aaron Judge together in the future can't happen.
I got one year to play, and contract extension stuff is nice, but I got bigger things to focus on."

     Summary: NEW YORK — Aaron Judge began what could be his last season with the New York Yankees after failing to agree to a long-term contract by the slugger's opening-day deadline to reach a deal.
"Obviously, our intent is to have Aaron Judge stay as a New York Yankee as we move forward, and I know that's his intent, as well, which is a good thing."
Cashman said the Yankees offered a contract averaging $30.5 million annually from 2023-29, with Judge's 2022 salary to be either the $17 million offered by the team in arbitration or the $21 million requested by the player.
He led the Yankees last season with a .287 batting average, 39 homers and 98 RBIs.
"He's the ultimate teammate," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.

     Summary: \"Just getting into extension talks, that's a blessing,\" Judge said before the game.
\"I never thought in my life I'd be in that opportunity, and it's not something that's guaranteed.
Judge has said that he and Odle would not negotiate with the Yankees during the season, believing that doing so would be a distraction.
\"We've got so many things to focus on, a lot of good things happening,\" Judge said.
But passing on the extension represents a significant gamble for Judge, who played in 242 of a possible 384 regular season games from 2018-20 due to various injuries.
