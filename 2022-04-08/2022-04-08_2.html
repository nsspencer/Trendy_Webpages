     Michael Bay says he saved money on Ambulance by sweet-talking the police
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But with a budget of just $40 million, his latest film, Ambulance, is a little more down-to-earth than his five Transformers movies, or even his Netflix project, 6 Underground.
Bay made the most of his slightly smaller budget, and Ambulance is still full of shootouts, explosions, car chases, and action.
This was just the regular escort crew assigned to the film, Bay explains, but it was also an opportunity.
What if you’re chasing an ambulance?’” Bay said.
It looks real because it is on a real freeway, and we are going that fast.

     Michael Bay's Ambulance Is Too Much of Everything—and That's the Point
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2022, Michael Bay’s style of filmmaking is as quaint as a bonnet.
But the too-muchness of it is the point and, the movie’s bloated runtime aside, the reward.
At some point, Gyllenhaal sputters a line suitable for many occasions: “It’s cashmere!”For a surprisingly solid stretch, Ambulance is great fun.
All that said, when Michael Bay starts looking like a Shaker craftsman compared with other big-budget Hollywood filmmakers, we know we’ve entered a new era.
You don’t have to be an ambulance hijacker to know these are crazy times.

     Review: Hard to deny escapist panache of 'Ambulance'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The robbery fails to go according to its hurried and haphazard plan, and, like in Michael Mann’s “Heat,” a bank-job-gone-wrong spills out onto downtown Los Angeles streets.
And while Bay’s film wouldn’t stand up to too much inquiry — this is a movie where a ruptured spleen is treated with a hairpin — it’s hard to deny its escapist panache.
Next to films like “Armageddon” and the “Transformers” movies, “Ambulance” was made for a surprisingly modest $40 million.
Maybe the film’s most unbelievable aspect is how empty of traffic the Los Angeles streets are.
When the injured cop in the ambulance goes into critical condition, Will donates blood while the chase continues.

     'Ambulance' review: Michael Bay delivers a wild ride you won't want to miss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Ambulance, Bay pairs up dashing leading men Jake Gyllenhaal and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II for an adrenaline-fueled heist that is an absolute blast.
But in a Bay movie, even cakes explode.
Fittingly freneticCar chases, explosions, and gun fights might be expected in Bay movies.
Bringing the energy of a coked-up douchebro, Gyllenhaal embodies the tone of a Michael Bay movie, making every moment he's onscreen explosive.
Ambulance kicks assEven with its rough spots, Ambulance is a raucous thrill ride with streaks of Bay brilliance.

     The Restless Youth of “Paris, 13th District”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Such was the opening shot of René Clair’s wonderful “Under the Roofs of Paris” (1930), and now, nearly a century later, the same thing happens at the beginning of “Paris, 13th District,” the latest film from Jacques Audiard.
The throb of the distant past is worth attending to, because in many respects “Paris, 13th District” appears—and aspires—to be a fable for our era.
Who ends up with whom in “Paris, 13th District” I will not divulge.
“Paris, 13th District” may be antsy on the eye, but “Ambulance” makes Audiard’s film look like an Andrew Wyeth.
Every Bay film is cheesy, but this one counts as high-speed cheese, grilled to the max by Danny’s thoughtful advice: “Just.

     ‘Ambulance’: Dead on arrival
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Fedak’s bone-stupid, so-called script hasn’t a shred of credibility, and his dialogue is as limp as a dead banana.
The one-dimensional acting ranges from ludicrously stoic — notably Garret Dillahunt’s somnambulant, I’ve-wandered-in-from-another-movie portrayal of LAPD tactical SIS Capt.
Monroe — to over-the-top, foaming-at-the-mouth derangement (Jake Gyllenhaal, take a bow for a performance so bad, you’re guaranteed a Razzzie Award).
Note to Mr. Bay: The mere fact that you can do something with drone cameras, doesn’t mean you should.
Will, therefore — unwisely — seeks a loan from his motor-mouthed career criminal brother, Danny (Gyllenhaal).

So it’s so hard for the middle class to succeed, and I think the movie really talks about that in a deeper way.
