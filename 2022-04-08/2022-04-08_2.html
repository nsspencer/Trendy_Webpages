     Summary: Former general manager Ned Colletti is no exception.
Colletti served as the Dodgers general manager from late 2005 to late 2014.
However, he might be best known for another big trade with Boston.
Yesterday, the former general manager announced that he is officially stepping away from the sport of baseball in a professional capacity.
As the adage goes, sometimes the best moves general managers make is the moves they don't make.

     Summary: The Dodgers wanted the left-hander to get as built up as possible for his first start of the year.
Before this season, Kershaw had been the Dodgers opening day starter every year when healthy since 2011.
Roberts, however, believes having Kershaw pitch the fifth game will be best for the pitcher and the team.
That’s the thought behind it.”Kershaw being healthy to start the season has been a pleasant surprise for the Dodgers.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The depth and length of the Dodgers lineup was evident in a six-batter stretch that spelled doom for Kyle Freeland and the Rockies.
Los Angeles only scored in one of nine innings on opening day, but the crooked number was enough in a 5-3 triumph at Coors Field.
Freeland was cruising, but his second time through the batting order showed the strength and depth of the Dodgers lineup.
That rally was more than enough for Buehler, who impressed in his first career opening day start.
It wasn’t quite a home run that turned into a single, but there was still an opening day oddity at Coors Field.

     Summary: Dodgers display lineup depth in five-run inning, beat Rockies on opening dayDodgers closer Craig Kimbrel delivers against the Colorado Rockies in the ninth inning of the Dodgers’ 5-3 win Friday.
(David Zalubowski / Associated Press)DENVER — On the first day of the season, Kyle Freeland became the Dodgers’ first victim.
For three innings Friday afternoon, the Colorado Rockies left-hander was cruising through his opening day start against the Dodgers’ star-studded lineup.
He had stranded each of the first four runners who reached base.
But then the Dodgers’ offense awoke from its winter slumber, roaring to life for the first time — and what is certain to be far from the last — this season.

Last season I thought the Dodgers would win the division easily.
But despite the questions, their offense and bullpen will be enough to win the division.
