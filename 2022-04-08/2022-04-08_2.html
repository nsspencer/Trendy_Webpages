Last season, the batting titles went to a couple of first-time winners.
Houston Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel took home the American League honors, and infielder Trea Turner earned the NL award after he split the season between the Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers.
Heading into 2022, we've highlighted five of the strongest candidates to claim the batting title in each league.

     Summary: Freddie Freeman in his first starting lineup with the Dodgers bats second, a role he’s become more accustomed to in the last two years.
Freeman starts at first base against the Rockies on Friday afternoon at Coors Field in Denver.
In 2021, Freeman went back to batting third until leadoff man Ronald Acuña Jr. got hurt, then shifted back to second.
This spring with the Dodgers, Freeman batted second in eight of his nine games, putting a left-handed bat between right-handers Mookie Betts at leadoff and Trea Turner batting third.
This is the seventh opening day start for Justin Turner, whose first game with the Dodgers in 2014 was a start at second base in Sydney, Australia.
