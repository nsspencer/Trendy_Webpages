     Michelle Yeoh Thought Crouching Tiger’s Weapons Fight Idea Was A Joke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michelle Yeoh reveals that she initially thought director Ang Lee's idea for one fight scene in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a joke.
One of Yeoh's most memorable roles, however, was Yu Shu Lien in 2000's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
Directed by Lee, who would soon after go on to direct Hulk starring Eric Bana, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon tells the story of Master Li (Chow Yun-Fat) and Shu Lien's quest to recover Green Destiny, the sword of a fabled warrior.
The film is renowned among fans of action cinema for its wuxia style and its complex and impressive fight choreography.
The fight sequence is one of the most memorable and intricately choreographed in the whole film and is widely remembered for the sheer number of weapons that Yeoh uses throughout.

     Everything Everywhere All At Once May Be Too Trippy for Its Own Good—But Michelle Yeoh Still Dazzles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She may have begun her career as an action star, but she also has a face that holds you.
Yeoh’s character, Evelyn, is the respectable, stressed-out owner of a laundry facility, which she runs with her mischievous but also somewhat retiring husband, Waymond.
Her daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), is in a serious relationship with a woman, a fact Evelyn is reluctant to accept.
(It should surprise no one that Yeoh began her career as a ballet dancer, and even as she inches toward 60, she’s still got the moves.)
But even if you walk away from Everything, Everywhere feeling you’ve just endured a cluttered, exhausting mess, Yeoh’s dazzling charm remains undimmed.

     What younger Asian actors tell Michelle Yeoh: ‘Finally, I can see myself’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michelle Yeoh is everywhere.
“What [is special about] this moment in my career is having so many people who look like me, especially the younger generation [of Asian actors], come up to me and say, ‘Finally, I can see myself doing all these kinds of things because you are doing it,’” Yeoh told People magazine in an interview published Thursday.
By a strange twist of fate, Evelyn is soon transported into various parallel universes occupied by different, powerful versions of herself.
After premiering at the SXSW Film Festival, the genre-bending fantasy has received a 97% rating on review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.
“I have to appreciate the ride I’ve been on,” Yeoh told People.

     Summary: The buddy cop film — starring two females, Michelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock (left), somewhat of a first — was just Yeoh's second feature.
"The first hurdle I had to go through was the guys accepting me to the boys' club," she told The Hollywood Reporter.
She joined the stuntmen at the gym, asking them to teach her their ways.
"I think it was quite refreshing for them," she added.
"Humility goes a long way."

     Michelle Yeoh Conquers the Universe(s)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Somewhere, in one of the gajillion strands of the cat’s cradle of multiverses, there is a world in which Michelle Yeoh does not start ballet lessons at the age of four.
He’s dining with a good friend of the then-21-year-old Michelle Yeoh, who had been reluctantly entered into a beauty contest by her mom and walked away with the title of Miss Malaysia.
By the time the producers of Tomorrow Never Dies, the 1997 James Bond film, came calling, Yeoh was ready to return.
Yeoh does not even need to get up to demonstrate.
“It’s ‘Michelle Wong, Michelle Yeoh…Michelle Wong, Michelle Yeoh.’ I pictured someone in audience sitting in the theater, someone on screen yells ‘Michelle,’ I turn around and the first thing they think is, ‘My god, why does Michelle Yeoh look so old!?
