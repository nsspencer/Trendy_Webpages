     Summary: A year ago, the Tigers played winning baseball in the second half, putting together an impressive 37-34 record, and this year’s roster is even better.
Mize, a right-hander, posted a 3.71 ERA last season and paced the Tigers in games (30) and innings pitched (150⅓).
Greene arguably had the better season of the two in the minors last year, but it’s still a big jump to the big leagues.
Even with his potential two-month setback, Greene will have a better season based on averages and projections once he gets called up.
