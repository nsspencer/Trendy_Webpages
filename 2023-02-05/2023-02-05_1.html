     Why are Foden &amp; De Bruyne not in Man City XI vs Spurs? Guardiola explains Premier League selection calls

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pep Guardiola has explained why Kevin De Bruyne was not named in Manchester City’s starting XI at Tottenham and why Phil Foden missed out completely.
Blues face tough test in north LondonBelgian midfielder on the benchEngland forward not in matchday squadWHAT HAPPENED?
The Blues opted to leave their Belgium international midfielder on the bench at Spurs, with Rico Lewis starting again while Rodri operated in a holding role and Bernardo Silva filled a playmaking post.
De Bruyne was once the first name on the team sheet for City, as a two-time PFA Player of the Year, but Guardiola has already admitted this season that the 31-year-old will miss out when his tactical system calls for something different.
City beat Spurs in the Premier League on January 19, with Guardiola’s side hitting back from trailing 2-0 at half-time to prevail 4-2 in a thrilling encounter at the Etihad Stadium.

     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur lead Manchester City 1-0 in this massive Premier League clash.
Harry Kane opened the scoring in the 15th minute, finishing from close range after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg stole the ball from City's defence.
Kane's goal moved him past Jimmy Greaves as Spurs' all-time record scorer, while he also became just the third player to reach 200 career Premier League goals.
Assistant coach Cristian Stellini is in charge of the Tottenham team after Antonio Conte had gallbladder surgery earlier this week.

     Summary: ✕ Close Guardiola keeps door open for Joao Cancelo's return to Manchester CityTottenham Hotspur will continue their quest to secure a top-four Premier League finish this season when they host Manchester City on Sunday.
Pep Guardiola’s team remain in the title fight, particularly after Arsenal’s defeat at Everton on Saturday, with victory leaving them only two points off the Gunners.
It will doubtless be a hard task to overcome Spurs though, who themselves can close the gap to fourth-placed Newcastle to just one point if they claim the win.
The clubs met just over two weeks ago and on that occasion Spurs took a two-goal first-half lead, before City roared back to win 4-2 - though Guardiola remained displeased and called out his team’s desire for a fight in the aftermath of that victory.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Half-time reportI'd not only say that Spurs have been the better side, but that they've had the better chances, too.
They have looked extremely comfortable for most of the game, with their defensive unit doing everything required to keep Haaland quiet in the final line.
Grealish has been City's most active player along with perhaps Mahrez, but the two have so far failed to make any real difference.
The shot at the end of the half that came off the crossbar was of course City's closest chance but apart from that things have been relatively calm.
City have passed around the block well but seem unable to find the killer ball to Haaland who has been blocked out by a thousand men.
