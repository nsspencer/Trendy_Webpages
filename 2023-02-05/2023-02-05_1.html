     Why are Foden &amp; De Bruyne not in Man City XI vs Spurs? Guardiola explains Premier League selection calls
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pep Guardiola has explained why Kevin De Bruyne was not named in Manchester City’s starting XI at Tottenham and why Phil Foden missed out completely.
Blues face tough test in north LondonBelgian midfielder on the benchEngland forward not in matchday squadWHAT HAPPENED?
The Blues opted to leave their Belgium international midfielder on the bench at Spurs, with Rico Lewis starting again while Rodri operated in a holding role and Bernardo Silva filled a playmaking post.
De Bruyne was once the first name on the team sheet for City, as a two-time PFA Player of the Year, but Guardiola has already admitted this season that the 31-year-old will miss out when his tactical system calls for something different.
City beat Spurs in the Premier League on January 19, with Guardiola’s side hitting back from trailing 2-0 at half-time to prevail 4-2 in a thrilling encounter at the Etihad Stadium.

The Manchester City manager could only watch as his side failed to do what Harry Kane has now made historic virtue out of.
The Tottenham Hotspur legend has now become their leading goalscorer, going one better than the great Jimmy Greaves with his 267th goal for the club.
That was this time without the recovering Antonio Conte present in the ground, as Guardiola’s problems only mounted.

     How 10-man Tottenham held on to beat Manchester City 1-0 thanks to Harry Kane's record-breaking goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur have beaten Manchester City 1-0 in a massive Premier League clash thanks to Harry Kane's record-breaking goal.
Kane opened the scoring in the 15th minute, finishing from close range after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg stole the ball from City's defence.
His goal moved him past Jimmy Greaves as Spurs' all-time record scorer, while he also became just the third player to reach 200 career Premier League goals.
City were given a lifeline in the closing minutes after Cristian Romero was sent off for a second yellow card, but Pep Guardiola's side were unable to find an equaliser.
Assistant coach Cristian Stellini was in charge of Spurs today after Antonio Conte had gallbladder surgery earlier this week.

     Summary: Harry Kane got the crucial goal after a first half error from Rodri gave the ball away on the edge of the box and the Spurs man is now the club's all-time leading goalscorer.
City, for their part, had another stodgy game in which Haaland failed to register a shot inside the box.
Spurs played an excellent game, they were defensively tough and picked their moments to counter.
Perhaps the attackers will be frustrated they only scored one, as they had numerous chances to put the game to bed throughout.
The red card for Cuti Romero was the only black mark on a great day for the London side, who will be without him for their trip to Leicester City.
