     How 10-man Tottenham held on to beat Manchester City 1-0 thanks to Harry Kane's record-breaking goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur have beaten Manchester City 1-0 in a massive Premier League clash thanks to Harry Kane's record-breaking goal.
Kane opened the scoring in the 15th minute, finishing from close range after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg stole the ball from City's defence.
His goal moved him past Jimmy Greaves as Spurs' all-time record scorer, while he also became just the third player to reach 200 career Premier League goals.
City were given a lifeline in the closing minutes after Cristian Romero was sent off for a second yellow card, but Pep Guardiola's side were unable to find an equaliser.
Assistant coach Cristian Stellini was in charge of Spurs today after Antonio Conte had gallbladder surgery earlier this week.

     Summary: [1/4] Soccer Football - Premier League - Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester City - Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London, Britain - February 5, 2023 Tottenham Hotspur's Harry Kane scores their first goal past Manchester City's Ederson and becomes Tottenham Hotspur's all time top goalscorer REUTERS/David KleinLONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Manchester City's bid to chop Arsenal's Premier League lead to two points was scuppered as Harry Kane's record-breaking goal earned Tottenham Hotspur a 1-0 win over the champions on Sunday.
Kane's 15th-minute effort punished some sloppy City passing and made him the north London club's all-time top goalscorer with 267, taking him past former great Jimmy Greaves whose record had stood since 1970.
Tottenham then withstood a late City siege with some tenacious defending to clinch a third win in four league games over Pep Guardiola's side.
Tottenham, whose manager Antonio Conte was absent after having surgery to remove his gallbladder, are fifth on 39 points from 22 games, one behind Newcastle United.
"Sooner or later it is going to change, but it is strange we haven't scored one goal," Guardiola said of City's troubles with Tottenham.

     Summary: Harry Kane got the crucial goal after a first half error from Rodri gave the ball away on the edge of the box and the Spurs man is now the club's all-time leading goalscorer.
City, for their part, had another stodgy game in which Haaland failed to register a shot inside the box.
Spurs played an excellent game, they were defensively tough and picked their moments to counter.
Perhaps the attackers will be frustrated they only scored one, as they had numerous chances to put the game to bed throughout.
The red card for Cuti Romero was the only black mark on a great day for the London side, who will be without him for their trip to Leicester City.
