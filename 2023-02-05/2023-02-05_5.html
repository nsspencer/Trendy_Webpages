     The Knicks are dealing with an RJ Barrett problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 16, 2023; New York, New York, USA; New York Knicks guard RJ Barrett (9) dunks the ball against Toronto Raptors forward Scottie Barnes (4) during the second half at Madison Square Garden.
Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY SportsWe have seen New York Knicks forward RJ Barrett endure slumps before, but something about this one just feels different.
Knicks’ RJ Barrett needs to regain his confidence:Even though Barrett is averaging 20 points per game over his last five games, his efficiency has plummeted, shooting just 42.9% from the field and 23.1% from 3 in that stretch.
“Barrett has the distinction of being the Knicks worst defender, folks,” Clyde Frazier said during the broadcast of Saturday’s game against the Clippers.
“They have all of these stats now, and he’s the worst guy.”The massive setbacks have led to some unprecedented moments for Barrett.

     Knicks’ Tom Thibodeau sticks with slumping RJ Barrett
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau closed with Barrett despite an ugly 6-for-21 shooting performance in part because he wanted to match up with the Clippers’ length in a 134-128 overtime loss at the Garden.
On Tuesday, in a loss to the Lakers, Thibodeau benched Barrett in the fourth quarter and went with Immanuel Quickley instead.
To Barrett’s credit, he did score six points in the fourth quarter Saturday as the Knicks rallied from a 17-point deficit.
RJ Barrett looks to make a move on Nicolas Batum during the Knicks 134-128 overtime loss to the Clippers.
In the nine games since Mitchell Robinson was sidelined with a fractured right thumb, the Knicks have allowed at least 116 points seven times.

     Summary: The Knicks (28-26) will look to find some rejuvenation when they face the 76ers (34-17) at home on Sunday night.
Heading into this game, the Knicks will need to put some attention to detail in closing out contests, especially since they rank 26th in fourth-quarter scoring per game.
From defending the perimeter to allowing the opposition to work the fast break, it’s no secret that the Knicks’ defense has to be better.
Regardless of who defends who, the Knicks will need yet another masterclass from Jalen Brunson in order to compete in today’s game.

     Why future is brighter for Knicks than the Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Irving’s sudden onset of calf soreness couldn’t stop the Nets from solidifying their hold on fourth place in the Eastern Conference.
Meanwhile, his talent for destroying all basketball dreams in his midst remains undefeated, as the stunning Nets comeback didn’t change the fact that the seventh-place Knicks now account for the more stable New York City option for the foreseeable future.
In Irving, Durant, and the long-since departed James Harden, their scorecard shows nothing but superstar trade demands within one year.
Either way, it is still true that the Nets have the better New York record and the better New York roster.
But believe it or not, the Knicks have the better New York future.
