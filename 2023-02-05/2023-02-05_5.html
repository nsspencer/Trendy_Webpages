Host Pedro Pascal as Mario and Chloe Fineman as a princess during the “New Video Game Series” sketch on Saturday, February 4, 2023.
It’s impressively complex for a pre-taped bit, and plays on not only HBO dramas but also the upcoming “Super Mario” movie starring Chris Pratt.
Pascal keeps wanting to “put a pin” in things, and he breaks multiple times — the audience loves it.
Pascal and Hernandez talk about Brittany in Spanish, letting English phrases slip like “nice white girl,” and “unisex apparel,” and “hit it and quit it.”
