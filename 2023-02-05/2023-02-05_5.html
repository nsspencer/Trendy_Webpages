     About the Ocean-Set Cliffhanger On This Week's '1923'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: About the Ocean-Set Cliffhanger On This Week's '1923'By Dustin Rowles | TV | February 5, 2023 |After a month-long midseason break, Paramount+’s 1923 returned this week to begin airing the back half of the first season (the streamer announced this week that it has also picked up a second season of the series).
I had expected a time jump after the midseason finale to account for the months it would take for Harrison Ford’s Jacob Dutton to recover from his injuries and Spencer Dutton to make his way to the ranch from Africa.
1923 will track Jacob’s recovery and Spencer’s journey from Africa to Montana, assuming that Spencer survives.
That’s the question lingering at the end of this week’s episode when the captain of the tug boat (played by Peter Stormare) taking Spencer and Alexandra from Africa to the Suez canal dies while manning the boat.
There is no preview for next week’s episode to put our minds at ease about the fate of Spencer, but there is one shot of a shirtless Spencer — not in this episode — taking aim at a shark with a shotgun.

     1923: The Dutton Family Suffers Another Loss in "Ghost of Zebrina"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a month-long break, Yellowstone prequel series 1923 returned this week with a larger than normal episode, "Ghost of Zebrina".
The episode brought more tragedy to the Dutton family — but also offered up a bit of hope for the future as well.
Warning: major spoilers for this week's episode of 1923, "Ghost of Zebrina", beyond this point.
Previously in the season, the Dutton family was ambushed by Banner Creighton (Jerome Flynn) and the resulting gunfight left Jacob Dutton (Harrison Ford) gravely injured as well as Jack's fiancée Elizabeth (Michelle Randolph), but sadly killed John Dutton Sr. (James Badge Dale).
However, while Emma Dutton dies in the episode, it's not necessarily all tragedy back in Montana.

     1923 Episode 5 Review: Ghost of Zebrina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There was a sense, or perhaps a naive hope that “Ghost of Zebrina” would be an episode that forever changed the face of the Dutton history almost immediately.
Instead of dealing with yet another tragedy, 1923 simply proceeded to that aforementioned tedium.
It is also not lost on this writer that with “Ghost of Zebrina” being the longest episode so far, should provide more content to write about, but ironically, that’s not the case.
Spencer and Alex’s storyline has been one of fiery and often melodramatic passion, but “Ghost of Zebrina” broke that streak.
For the majority of the episode the couple simply make travel arrangements to get back to the States as soon as possible.

     1923 Returns with Another Death-Defying Cliffhanger
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [Warning: The following contains spoilers for the fifth episode of 1923.
All things considered, life could be a lot worse on the Dutton ranch on 1923.
This simply cannot be the end of Spencer Dutton, especially with a second season on the horizon, but things are not looking good!
Maybe Teonna left behind a revolution of sorts, or maybe things at the boarding school, which are already so distressing that I often can't watch, will get even worse.
Boat adventures are fun for a minute, or a different show, but this show needs Spencer Dutton on the Dutton ranch, regardless of how many time jumps that requires.

     '1923' Episode 5 Recap: Another Branch Added to the Dutton Family Tree

     Summary: In a brief exchange, Jacob tells Jack they need a leader, but he's not the man for the job—not yet.
Jacob tells Cara the cowboys can't see him so weak.
The final moments of Episode 5As Spencer, Alex and Lucca are sailing, they see a larger ship, which troubles the captain.
In the kitchen, Elizabeth nervously tells Cara she wants to move the wedding up, to a time she'll still fit in her dress.
This supports the theory held by many fans, that Jack Dutton is John Dutton III's grandfather, making the late John Dutton Sr. his great grandfather, and the late James Dutton his great-great grandfather.

     Summary: Michael Greyeyes rides into the Taylor Sheridan universe as 1923 returns from midseason hiatus.
Here are some random thoughts prompted by “Ghost of Zebrina,” Episode 105 of 1923, which premiered early Sunday on Paramount+.
After buying land adjoining Yellowstone, he’s determined to gain control of “the whole valley,” one way or another, to mine for gold.
Cara happily agreed, noting: “That is the first good news these ears have heard in months.” No kidding.
Shortly before that, however, Cara had her first face-to-face confrontation with Whitfield, who did his sweet-talking best to charm her.

Spencer calmly puts out a mayday call on the radio and makes contact just as he realizes that THE GHOST SHIP IS UPON THEM.
She’s standoffish, and he’s simultaneously patronizing and threatening as he talks about how he’ll just come whenever he likes.
