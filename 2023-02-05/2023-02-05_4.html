     Tottenham vs Manchester City Premier League match live score updates: Hosts lead 1-0 on record-breaking Kane goal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur lead Manchester City 1-0 in this massive Premier League clash.
Harry Kane opened the scoring in the 15th minute, finishing from close range after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg stole the ball from City's defence.
Kane's goal moved him past Jimmy Greaves as Spurs' all-time record scorer, while he also became just the third player to reach 200 career Premier League goals.
Assistant coach Cristian Stellini is in charge of the Tottenham team after Antonio Conte had gallbladder surgery earlier this week.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Half-time reportI'd not only say that Spurs have been the better side, but that they've had the better chances, too.
They have looked extremely comfortable for most of the game, with their defensive unit doing everything required to keep Haaland quiet in the final line.
Grealish has been City's most active player along with perhaps Mahrez, but the two have so far failed to make any real difference.
The shot at the end of the half that came off the crossbar was of course City's closest chance but apart from that things have been relatively calm.
City have passed around the block well but seem unable to find the killer ball to Haaland who has been blocked out by a thousand men.
