     Tottenham vs Manchester City Premier League match live score updates: Record-breaking Kane goal gives hosts 1-0 lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: February 5, 2023 at 11:26 AM ESTWhen these teams met just a few weeks ago, Manchester City came from 2-0 down at half-time to beat Spurs 4-2 in a pulsating match at the Etihad Stadium.
The outstanding Riyad Mahrez played a part in the first two goals before scoring two himself to complete an immense comeback.
City had been booed off at half-time after a dramatic end to the first half.
Ivan Perisicâ€™s shot ricocheted off Rico Lewis and onto the crossbar before Mahrez beat Hugo Lloris at the near post to give City the lead.
Mahrez finished the match in the last minute, dinking the ball lazily over Lloris after a mistake from the substitute Clement Lenglet.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The strange way the season has fallen means the reverse fixture between these two sides only took place last month, with City winning 4-2 at the Etihad Stadium.
The last time City won away to Spurs in all competitions was back in 2018; since then, Spurs have won by an aggregate score of 6-0.
City are yet to win or even score at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
Spursâ€™ last home win came in November, when they beat Leeds 4-3 in a crazy game that saw the away side take the lead on three separate occasions.
Tottenham have lost all five of their league matches this season against sides that are currently above them in the table; City are looking to win three consecutive league games for the first time this campaign.
