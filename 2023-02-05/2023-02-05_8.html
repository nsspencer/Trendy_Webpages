     Coldplay Take On Fan-Favorite During Emotional 'SNL' Performance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Coldplay performed on Saturday Night Live for the seventh time last night (February 4), and did not disappoint.
For their first song, the band played "The Astronaut," their 2022 single with BTS member Jin.
The stage was set with bright lights and stars, and an ASL interpreter came out to sign and dance with Chris Martin, all while donning a friendly alien mask.
For their second performance, Coldplay orchestrated a medley of two heartfelt songs: "Human Heart" off 2021's Music of the Spheres and fan-favorite "Fix You" off 2005's X&amp;Y.
Jacob Collier and choral ensemble Jason Max Ferdinand Singers joined the band for the emotional performance.

     'SNL': Chris Martin and Coldplay took flight with choir-backed version of classic 'Fix You'
    </h2>

     Summary: "The Last of Us" star Pedro Pascal was the host of Feb. 4's "Saturday Night Live," but Chris Martin and Coldplay brought the music.
The British band returned to "SNL" for the seventh time as the show's musical guest Saturday and performed their single "The Astronaut," co-written by BTS’ Jin.
Martin and the chorus then segued the song into a rousing version of Coldplay's 2005 audience-favorite hit “Fix You," as stars lit up the ceiling behind the stage.
But the "Last of Us" star showed the world he can shake it during the promos.
Pascal was featured dancing with a Clicker zombie.
