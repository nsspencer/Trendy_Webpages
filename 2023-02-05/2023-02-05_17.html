Though the new episode won’t run as long as last week’s, we can still expect some big moments and, based on the preview, more action.

     THE LAST OF US: Melanie Lynskey Makes Her Debut In New Photos From Episode 4: "Please Hold to My Hand"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following its best hour yet, The Last of Us returns for its fourth installment tonight, and while it's expected to deviate from the game ever so slightly, introducing a dangerous new group of survivors led by an original character named Kathleen (Melanie Lynskey), the episode will keep Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) moving forward on their journey.
Their latest stop will be in Kansas City, a location that isn't in the game, but it looks as though her group of raiders will act similarly to the wild group of hunters from the game, who caused plenty of trouble for our heroes.
The preview teased that Kathleen will be hellbent on finding someone, but it's hard to tell whether she's looking for Joel or someone else.
Meanwhile, the episode will also feature Jeffrey Pierce, who was the original voice and mo-cap actor for Tommy in The Last of Us video game.
This time, he'll play one of Kathleen's top lieutenants, Perry.
