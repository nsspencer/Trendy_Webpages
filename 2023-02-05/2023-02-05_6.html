     Summary: The Pro Bowl Games have been a lot of fun to watch, especially when you compare them to the old format of a watered-down traditional football game.
The Minnesota Vikings have six players playing in the games with four skill players on offense.
Two of them connected on a touchdown pass with Kirk Cousins throwing one to Justin Jefferson.
The two connected for 128 passes and 1,804 yards during the regular season and they did so for a touchdown in the Pro Bowl games.
Cousins was immediately pressured by Maxx Crosby but he escaped to the right before going to the left.
