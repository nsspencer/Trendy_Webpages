Helen Mirren’s Cara Dutton might be the heart and soul of the show, but even she reeks of doom in the wind.
Poor Cara Dutton, who has plenty of allies in Bozeman’s other cattle-ranching families, but no soldiers.
Soon, a flotilla of ships is passing word from Kilindini Harbour to the Indian Ocean and up the Red Sea through the Suez Canal that Spencer Dutton is on the move.
(The first snow has yet to fall, so I think we can assume it’s still the year 1923, at least.)
