     'SNL': Chris Martin and Coldplay took flight with choir-backed version of classic 'Fix You'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "The Last of Us" star Pedro Pascal was the host of Feb. 4's "Saturday Night Live," but Chris Martin and Coldplay brought the music.
The British band returned to "SNL" for the seventh time as the show's musical guest Saturday and performed their single "The Astronaut," co-written by BTS’ Jin.
Martin and the chorus then segued the song into a rousing version of Coldplay's 2005 audience-favorite hit “Fix You," as stars lit up the ceiling behind the stage.
But the "Last of Us" star showed the world he can shake it during the promos.
Pascal was featured dancing with a Clicker zombie.
