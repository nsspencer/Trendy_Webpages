    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Islamabad — Gen. Pervez Musharraf, whose role as Pakistan's military ruler at the time of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on the U.S. made him a household name, has died at the age of 79.
Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the Pakistani military also confirmed his death and offered condolences to his family.
The two countries have long been adversaries, and Musharraf and other Pakistani military commanders viewed Sharif's overtures to India's Hindu nationalist government with extreme suspicion, even hostility.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf died Sunday, February 5, after a prolonged illness, according to a statement from the Pakistani military.
The former leader had been living in self-imposed exile in the United Arab Emirates since 2016.
He seized power from former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a military coup in 1999 and appointed himself president in 2001.
Musharraf became a key ally of the United States following the 9/11 terror attacks, and he tried to become an indispensable figure in combating Islamic extremism.
But his time in power was marred with controversy, and he was accused of widespread human rights abuses and oppression.

     Summary: Ex-Pakistan leader Pervez Musharraf, who aided U.S. war in Afghanistan, has diedEnlarge this image toggle caption Beth Keiser/AP Beth Keiser/APISLAMABAD, Pakistan – Pervez Musharraf, who was Pakistan's military ruler for nearly a decade, has died in Dubai after a long illness.
The attacks were masterminded by al-Qaida leader Osama Bin Laden, who the Taliban were sheltering in Afghanistan, a country that shares a long border with Pakistan.
The Taliban swept to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, and Afzal says that was partly a result of Musharraf's policies.
"The fact that the Taliban had sanctuary in Pakistan... Musharraf was the one who began that policy."
Musharraf, a former special forces commando, was the last military dictator to rule Pakistan.

     Summary: ISLAMABAD/DUBAI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Pakistan's former President Pervez Musharraf, a key U.S. ally in the campaign against al Qaeda following the militant group's Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, died in Dubai on Sunday after a prolonged illness.
"I offer my condolences to the family of General Pervez Musharraf," tweeted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

This decision contradicted Pakistan's long-standing support for the Taliban, which at that point controlled Afghanistan, and made Musharraf a target for domestic militant groups.
In a 2006 memoir, Musharraf said he "saved" Pakistan by joining the campaign against al Qaeda.

     Summary: The Pakistani military also offered its condolences as did Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, the younger brother of the prime minister Musharraf overthrew in 1999.
They regrouped and the offshoot Pakistani Taliban emerged, beginning a yearslong insurgency in the mountainous border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Though Pakistan under Musharraf launched these operations, the militants still thrived as billions of American dollars flowed into the nation.
He’d launch his own attempt at capturing territory in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir in 1999 just before seizing power from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
He held flawed elections in late 2002 — only after changing the constitution to give himself sweeping powers to sack the prime minister and parliament.
