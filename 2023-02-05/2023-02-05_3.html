     Summary: Time to forget last year's Pro BowlA change in the NFL format was a long time coming, but last year was the straw that broke the camel’s back if we are going to use metaphors.
If we’re being nice, we could say that there was a serious lack of interest or competition in the Pro Bowl in Las Vegas.
No one wanted to play, and no one wanted to tackle.
Now it’s time to see how the new look Pro Bowl plays out, or the NFL could be looking to tweak the format yet again.
This was one of the few good plays, and Max Crosby still didn’t tackle the QB.
