     Michigan State basketball Malik Hall misses game vs. Purdue, likely 'out for a while'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EAST LANSING — Malik Hall missed Michigan State basketball’s game Monday afternoon against Purdue.
Hall’s latest injury is being deemed an aggravation of the stress reaction in his left foot, which forced him out of eight games earlier this season.
Hall missed eight games in November and December with a stress reaction in his left foot, and he twisted it against Michigan on Jan. 7 but returned for the second half.
In nine games this season, Hall averages 9.9 points and 4.1 rebounds.
The Spartans missed his defensive presence and ability to guard multiple positions and switch on screens down the stretch against Purdue.
