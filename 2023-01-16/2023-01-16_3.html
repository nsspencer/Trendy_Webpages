     Alabama Men's Basketball Player Arrested On Capital Murder Charge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama men's basketball player Darius Miles was among two individuals charged with capital murder in connection to the fatal shooting of a 23-year-old woman near the University of Alabama campus early Sunday (January 15) morning, ESPN reports.
Michael Lynn Davis, 20, of Charles County, Maryland, was identified as the other individual charged in the incident.
Miles and Davis were charged with capital murder because shots involved in the fatal incident were reported to be fired into a vehicle, according to Kennedy.
Neither Harris nor the driver were believed to be affiliated with the University of Alabama, according to Kennedy.
A video shared by AL.com shows Miles saying, "I swear...I love you more than you imagine," while being escorted into a police vehicle by officers.
