     Cardinals hire Titans exec Monti Ossenfort as new general manager
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ossenfort has been a popular name in recent GM hiring cycles, interviewing with a number of teams in the last few years, but ultimately remaining in Tennessee.
Ossenfort was once again a hot candidate early in the GM cycle this year, interviewing with the Titans among other teams.
Unlike past years, he's leaving Tennessee a little over a month after the Titans fired GM Jon Robinson.
Ossenfort joined the Titans in 2020 as director of player personnel, serving in that role through the 2022 season.
He joins a Cardinals team in need of a new direction after firing coach Kliff Kingsbury and accepting the resignation of GM Steve Keim.

     Cardinals Hire Monti Ossenfort As New General Manager
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Owner Michael Bidwill tabbed Monti Ossenfort, who has been the Titans director of player personnel, as Steve Keim's successor on Monday.
"It was critically important for us to find the right person to lead us as general manager and there is no doubt in my mind that we have that in Monti Ossenfort," Bidwill said in a statement.
We could not be more thrilled to have Monti and his family joining the Cardinals."
Next order of business will be to have Ossenfort help Bidwill in selecting the new head coach.
Ossenfort was with the Patriots while Brian Flores -- who the Cardinals will reportedly interview for the coaching vacancy -- was a coach on New England's staff.

     Monti Ossenfort brings a focus along the offensive and defensive line to the Arizona Cardinals general manager position
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What the Arizona Cardinals are doing is what they always do, but to me this move at general manager is a positive.
What I mean, when you look at the Cardinals, they tend to swing from offensive to defensive coaches as their head coach.
In Ossenfort’s time with both teams, an emphasis has been along the offensive and defensive lines.
The Cardinals in the Keim era drafted 10 offensive or defensive linemen/edge rushers in the top three rounds.
If the Cardinals could build a line with a Wynn, Thuney, Karras, Mason... Man that would be quite the departure.
