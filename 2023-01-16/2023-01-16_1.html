     Dead sperm whale washes up at Oregon’s Fort Stevens State Park in ‘unusual’ encounter, expert says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A dead sperm whale washed ashore in Oregon on Saturday in what officials are calling an unusual sight for this time of year.
Sightseers visited the coast to catch a glimpse of the massive creature at Fort Stevens State Park near Astoria.
NOAA spokesman Michael Milstein told the station that the sperm whale was fully grown, measuring 40 to 50 feet in length.
"Does this help us understand the population and distribution of sperm whales off the West Coast?"
On Wednesday, a 21-foot female orca carcass washed up on a beach in Palm Coast, Florida.

     'A Bright New Boise,' a dark comedy from 'The Whale' playwright, comes to Palm Springs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "A Bright New Boise" by Samuel D. Hunter kicks off the new season for Palm Springs-based theater group Dezart Performs.
Hunter is also the playwright behind the critically acclaimed film, "The Whale," which has garnered a great deal of Oscar buzz this awards season .
His journey starts with the character seeking employment at a Hobby Lobby in Boise, Idaho — the same store where his son works.
However, there is a sense of hope within Will that Harper wants to portray to the audience.
The play is labeled as a dark comedy and lot of the humour comes from the hyper-characterizations of the other roles.

     Endangered whale’s severely injured body washes ashore in Oregon, video shows
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A dead endangered whale washed ashore in Oregon, video shows.
The severely injured body of an endangered whale washed ashore in Oregon, according to an aquarium.
“That is about the typical size of an adult sperm whale,” Milstein said.
The whale looked emaciated, meaning “it was having trouble eating,” Robert Pitman, a marine ecologist at Oregon State University’s Marine Mammal Institute, told The Oregonian.
“They feed on deep water species, such as squid, sharks, skates, and fish.”Though the species’ “population is recovering,” sperm whales remain endangered, according to the aquarium.

     40-foot endangered sperm whale washes ashore in Oregon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 40-foot sperm whale was found dead along the Oregon coast on Saturday, after its body washed ashore on a stretch of beach at Fort Stevens State Park, officials said.
The aquarium also shared a brief video to its social media page of the beached sperm whale after it was discovered.
Yesterday afternoon a 40-foot sperm whale washed ashore just south of the Peter Iredale in Fort Steven’s State Park.
Milstein told CBS News on Monday that a sperm whale measuring 40 feet is "about the typical size" for an adult male.
"So the presence of the sperm whale at this time of year is somewhat unusual but we have had sperm whale strandings in winter before," Milstein explained, adding, "Sperm whales are the third most common species of whale to strand in Oregon, after gray whales and humpback whales."
