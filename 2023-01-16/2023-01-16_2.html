     Summary: Rafael Nadal overcomes error-strewn performances and cramping Jack Draper at Australian OpenDefending champion Rafael Nadal was far from his best as he produced an error-laden performance during his opening-round victory over Jack Draper at the Australian Open.
Draper copied Nadal’s look as a child but also modelled his game around his hero, including playing left-handed even though he is naturally right-handed.
He settled well into the contest, facing only one break point before a poorly executed drop shot enabled Nadal to claim the opening set.
During a long point in the fourth game, Draper began to cramp again, and he was completely hamstrung during the formalities of the final few games.
