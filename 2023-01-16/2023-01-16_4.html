     Australian Open 2023: Nick Kyrgios withdraws from tournament due to knee injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just hours before his scheduled first round match against Roman Safiullin, Nick Kyrgios announced that he is withdrawing from the Australian Open on Monday during a surprise press conference.
Kyrgios made the decision as a result of a left knee injury that will require arthroscopic surgery.
Kyrgios had just competed against nine-time Australian Open winner Novak Djokovic on Friday in a charity match at Melbourne Park.
Kyrgios was coming off an impressive 2022 season in which he won the Australian Open doubles title with fellow countryman Thanasi Kokkinakis last year.
... Every time I land on serve or push off my serve, you can see on the side of my knee there's like a little lump.

     Summary: Boris Becker on Nick Kyrgios’ Australian Open withdrawal: ‘It’s a pity for all of us’Nick Kyrgios’ withdrawal from the 2023 Australian Open is not only a big blow for the tournament, but also fans and pundits.
Former world No 1 Boris Becker admitted he was surprised by Kyrgios’ withdrawal as he looked to be fit during the exhibition match against Novak Djokovic on Friday.
Nevertheless, it is of course very bitter to have to pull out of your home Grand Slam before the first round due to an injury.
It’s a pity for all of us.”Fellow former world No 1 Mats Wilander played down suggestions that Kyrgios was one of the favourites.
“He wasn’t one of my favourites because we’ve never seen him go close to winning a Grand Slam,” he said.

     Nick Kyrgios Withdraws From Australian Open After Gross Fluid Drained From Knee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nick Kyrgios is out of the Australian Open -- the tennis star officially withdrew from the high-profile tourney ... after he had some disgusting, ketchup-like fluid drained from his knee.
He shared on his IG story shortly before the announcement that the injury had led to a buildup of a gnarly substance in his knee that required a procedure to remove.
This is my home tournament, and obviously, winning the tournament in doubles [last year] and playing the best tennis of my life.
Kyrgios had faced Novak Djokovic, a nine-time Australian Open champion, in a charity match on Friday, but according to his physiotherapist, Will Maher, the knee didn't respond well to the action.
Kyrgios, the 19 seed, had been slated to go up against Roman Safiullin in the first round of the tourney on Tuesday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The time was 4pm, 27 hours before Nick Kyrgios was due to play his opening match and three minutes before he confirmed he would not.
Now, on the eve of his match at the Australian Open, it is the knee.
But this time there was no room for doubt because Kyrgios had brought with him a press conference chaperone – his physiotherapist.
Kyrgios subsequently shared a photo of the bloody gunge that was extracted: see Appendix 3 on Instagram for supplementary material.
Kyrgios looks focused during a practice session on Saturday, but has not sufficiently recovered from a knee injury to play in Melbourne.

     Summary: MELBOURNE, Australia — A “devastated” Nick Kyrgios pulled out of the Australian Open on Monday — the day before he was scheduled to play his first-round singles match — because of an injured left knee that needs arthroscopic surgery.
