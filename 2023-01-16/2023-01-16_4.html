In collaboration with the estate of the civil rights leader, the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum unveiled a talking King bobblehead Monday, honoring his life and legacy.
King’s estate worked with the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum in Milwaukee to create the limited edition bobblehead.
The estate, which owns the rights to King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, is careful about approving the use of the speech for commercial use, he said.
At the largest gathering for civil rights of its time, King delivered the “I Have a Dream” speech before about 250,000 people on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
