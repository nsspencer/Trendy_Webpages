     Summary: Busloads of migrants dropped off near Kamala Harris's home on Christmas EveEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty ImagesSeveral busloads of migrants were dropped off outside of the Washington, D.C., residence of Vice President Kamala Harris on Christmas Eve — apparently the latest in an escalating battle between state officials and the Biden administration over the country's immigration policy.
A total of three busloads of migrants arrived at the Naval Observatory, where Harris lives, on Saturday evening, WTOP reported.
Greg Abbott, said his state is purposefully busing migrants to sanctuary cities, where law enforcement are discouraged from deporting immigrants.
Two previous busloads of migrants arrived at Harris' residence in September, following an interview in which Harris said the border was secure.
With perilous temperatures moving into the area, many of these migrants are at risk of freezing to death on city streets."

     Greg Abbott blasted for 'cruel stunt' as migrants bussed to Kamala Harris' home on Christmas Eve
    </h2>

     Summary: Greg Abbott and "extremist Republicans' cruel values" after several busloads of migrants were dropped off outside U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris' Washington, D.C. home in subfreezing temperatures on Christmas Eve.
While it is not known who ordered the migrants bussed to the capital, advocates pointed fingers at Abbott.
"What we're seeing are Greg Abbott and extremist Republicans' cruel values," tweeted the youth-led Sunrise Movement.
"This was intended to be a cruel stunt by Greg Abbott, but people are working around the clock to treat these families with the dignity they deserve," she added.
On December 19, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts granted a request from 19 Republican-led states to temporarily block the Biden administration from ending Title 42 expulsions.

     Democrats outraged over Christmas Eve migrant drop-off at VP’s house

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Democrats are blasting the busing of migrants to Vice President Harris’s Washington, D.C., residence on Christmas Eve, taking aim at Texas Gov.
But it will likely intensify the feud over immigration, especially as Title 42 hangs in the balance.
The Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network, a local aid group, took the migrants to a church to receive assistance, according to ABC 7.
Ron DeSantis (R) flew two planes of migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts in September.
“With cold temperatures gripping Texas, your inaction to secure the southern border is putting the lives of migrants at risk, particularly in the City of El Paso,” Abbott wrote.

     Summary: Migrant families inside the bus that took them from Texas to the Washington residence of Kamala Harris last Saturday.
APOver 100 migrants who arrived in the United States via Mexico’s border with Texas have been bused to Washington DC and dropped off directly outside Vice President Kamala Harris’ official residence.
Since last spring, the Texas governor has moved thousands of migrants on from his state, sending them mostly to Washington DC, Chicago and New York.

Last week, nine buses were sent from the US border to Washington, containing mostly Ecuadorian and Colombian migrants, according to SAMU First Response.
