     Taiwan reports China's largest incursion yet to air defense zone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: J-20 stealth fighter jets fly during training for the 14th Airshow China in Guangdong province on Nov. 5, 2022.
Seventy-one Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone in the past 24 hours, the island's government said on Monday, the largest reported incursion to date.
Of the aircraft, 43 also crossed the Taiwan Strait's median line, an unofficial buffer between the two sides that lies within the defense zone, Taiwan's Defense Ministry said in a report, as Beijing continues military activities close to the Chinese-claimed island.
Taiwan's official Central News Agency said it was the largest Chinese air force incursion to date, although there was no sense of alarm on the island, which has witnessed a steady increase in Chinese pressure in recent years.
Taiwan, which strongly rejects China's sovereignty claims, said the drills showed Beijing was destroying regional peace and trying to intimidate Taiwan's people.

     Dozens of Chinese warplanes cross Taiwan median line
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Taiwan’s official Central News Agency said it was the largest Chinese air force incursion to date, although there was no sense of alarm on the island.
Between 6am Sunday and 6am Monday, 47 of the Chinese planes crossed the median of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial boundary once tacitly accepted by both sides, according to Taiwan’s defence ministry.
Taiwan said it monitored the Chinese moves using its land-based missile systems and navy vessels.
China’s military has often used large military exercises as a demonstration of force in response to US government actions in support of Taiwan.
It conducted large live-fire military exercises in August in response to US House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.
