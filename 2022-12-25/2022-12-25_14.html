     After blasting U.S. defense aid to Taiwan, China begins military exercises around island it claims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: China launched naval and airpower exercises around Taiwan on Sunday, a day after officials in Beijing blasted the Biden administration for an $858 billion defense bill that authorized additional security assistance for the self-ruling island that China claims.
China blamed increased tensions that triggered the air and naval drills on “escalations of provocations” from the U.S. operating in collusion with Taiwan.
A senior military spokesman said the U.S. doesn’t have the right to insert itself into the question.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022 resulted in protests from China, which quickly ordered military exercises around the island.
“Nothing about the visit changed one iota of the U.S. government’s policy toward Taiwan or China.

     China stages ‘strike drills’ around Taiwan, citing provocation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Taiwan accuses Beijing of destroying regional peace and trying to cow its people.
China’s military says it has conducted “strike drills” in the sea and airspace around Taiwan in response to what it says is provocation from the democratically governed island and the United States.
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, said the drills on Sunday showed Beijing was attacking regional peace and trying to cow Taiwan’s people.
In a brief statement, the Eastern Theatre Command of the Chinese army said it had carried out “joint combat readiness patrols and joint firepower strike drills” around Taiwan.
The Chinese drills coincided with newly elected mayors and county chiefs taking up their positions in Taiwan following local elections last month, in which the ruling Democratic Progressive Party was trounced.

     China sends 47 aircraft across Taiwan Strait and coducts military drills near Japan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It added that a total of 71 Chinese aircraft were spotted around the island, and that Taiwan’s military have responded by tasking combat air patrol aircrafts, navy vessels, and land-based missile systems.
The flights, part of a so-called “strike drill” according to China’s military, follow Naval exercises by a Chinese aircraft carrier group in the Western Pacific close to Japan on Friday.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan – a democratically governed island of 24 million – as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it.
Drills near JapanLast Friday, China also conducted a series of military drills close to Japan’s southern Okinawa island in the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese authorities.
Tensions between China and Japan have also been rising steadily, with Beijing growing its naval and air forces in areas near Japan.

     Summary: A Taiwan Emergency Makes Japan a “Front-Line State”Some in the US government have begun to express concern that Xi Jinping’s timetable for advancing on Taiwan has accelerated.
Xi Jinping may well be thinking, “If not now, when?” The prospect of a Taiwan contingency is becoming increasingly real.
The extent of the damage Japan suffers ultimately depends on how prepared for this contingency Japan is.
Increasing defense spending should also be discussed when taking into account Japan’s wider budget and spending priorities.
