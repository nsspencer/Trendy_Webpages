     More migrants bussed to Kamala Harris’s home on Christmas Eve
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three busloads of migrants were dropped off outside the Washington DC home of US vice-president Kamala Harris late on Christmas Eve, the latest episode in an escalating battle between the Joe Biden White House and the governors of southern Republican states over federal immigration policy.
Texas’s far-right governor, Greg Abbott, has previously sent buses to Harris’s Naval Observatory home.
“It really does show the cruelty behind governor Abbott and his insistence on continuing to bus people here without care about people arriving late at night on Christmas Eve when the weather is so cold,” Fischer said.
“Christmas Eve and freezing cold weather is no different,” Laborde told CNN.
Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis and Arizona’s governor Doug Ducey have also transported migrants to cities that are run by Democrats.

     Migrants from Texas dropped off outside VP Harris' home on freezing Christmas Eve
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But immigration activists said Saturday’s incident was particularly cruel because of the freezing temperatures in the nation's capital and because it occurred on Christmas Eve.
The buses dropped the migrants near Harris’ residence at the Naval Observatory.
Migrant families get on a bus to be transported to a church after they arrived in Washington, D.C., on Christmas Eve.
Texas alone has sent nearly 15,000 migrants to other cities since April, according to a review by NBC News.
There have been several instances of migrants being dropped off outside, or near, Harris’ residence.

     Democrats outraged over Christmas Eve migrant drop-off at VP’s house
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Democrats are blasting the busing of migrants to Vice President Harris’s Washington, D.C., residence on Christmas Eve, taking aim at Texas Gov.
But it will likely intensify the feud over immigration, especially as Title 42 hangs in the balance.
The Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network, a local aid group, took the migrants to a church to receive assistance, according to ABC 7.
Ron DeSantis (R) flew two planes of migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts in September.
“With cold temperatures gripping Texas, your inaction to secure the southern border is putting the lives of migrants at risk, particularly in the City of El Paso,” Abbott wrote.
