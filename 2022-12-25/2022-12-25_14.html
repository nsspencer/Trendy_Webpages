     Dolphins' Jaylen Waddle stuns Packers for 84-yard TD from Tua Tagovailoa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Karl Rasmussen · 2 min readThe Miami Dolphins found the end zone first on their Christmas Day matchup against the Green Bay Packers, courtesy of a highlight-reel TD for the ages.
On what a standard slant route on the first play of the Dolphins’ second drive of the game, Jaylen Waddle managed to create a ton of separation and burst down the sideline.
Waddle absolutely bamboozled the Packers en route to the end zone, recording what was his second 60+ yard TD pass in as many weeks.
En route to the end zone, he had Alexander looking completely lost as he badly missed a tackle and ended up along the sidelines.
Aaron Rodgers and Co. will have their work cut out for them now as they look to claw back against the Dolphins, hoping for a big play of their own.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle have quickly turned into one of the most dangerous receiving duos in the NFL, and Hill proved that he doesn’t even need the football to make an impact.
During Sunday’s Week 16 Christmas Day matchup against the Green Bay Packers, the Dolphins found the end zone on an 84-yard, catch-and-run touchdown by Waddle.
There really isn’t another player in the league who could pull something off like that.
Waddle was running full speed, and Hill seemingly ran stride for stride with him while blocking.
Fans were understandably impressed with the entire sequence.
