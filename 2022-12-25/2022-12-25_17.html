     Arizona Cardinals' Kyler Murray to have surgery Jan. 3 for torn ACL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray is set to have surgery to repair a torn ACL in his right knee on Jan. 3, NBC Sports’ Melissa Stark reported on the Sunday Night Football broadcast.
Murray went down on a run in the first quarter of a Monday Night Football matchup with the New England Patriots on Dec. 12.
NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that Murray also has a torn meniscus, which will be repaired to stabilize the knee.
Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury told reporters Murray would have surgery sometime after Christmas and go through “prehab” workouts beforehand.
ACL surgery can take from 6-9 months to recover, though more typically to 8-9 months for athletes to return to sports, according to UC Health.

     Arizona Cardinals QB Kyler Murray set to have his ACL knee surgery on Jan. 3, 2023 in Dallas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyler Murray is set to have his knee surgery.
During the Cardinals' game against the Buccaneers Sunday night, NBC's Melissa Stark reported the Cardinals quarterback will have his procedure to repair his torn ACL on Jan. 3 in Dallas.
According to the report, the timetable for Murray's return would be about nine months, which would mean October of 2023, about four games into the season, give or take.
It doesn't hurt that Murray is from the Dallas area and his family resides there.
It's still unknown where Murray will do the bulk of his rehab.
