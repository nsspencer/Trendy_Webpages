     Summary: PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA - DECEMBER 24: Josh Jacobs #28 of the Las Vegas Raiders runs the ball during the second quarter against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Acrisure Stadium on December 24, 2022 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Jacobs is one of the lone bright spots on this Raiders team which has yet to play up to its talent.
Josh Jacobs calls out the RaidersSo, what gives?
In a game with negative wind chill and perhaps colder than that on the field, how were Carr and Co. to operate without much of a running game?
It’s easy to understand Jacobs’ frustration, as many pinned Las Vegas as a playoff team before the start of the year.
