     Jayson Tatum Hyped by NBA Twitter For Dropping 41 in Celtics' Win vs. Giannis, Bucks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brian Fluharty/Getty ImagesThis year's marquee Christmas Day matchup pitted two NBA MVP candidates against each other as Jayson Tatum's Boston Celtics welcomed Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks to town.
He out-dueled Antetokounmpo, who finished with 27 points but struggled to find a rhythm, shooting 9-of-22 from the field.
Tatum has now scored over 30 points in five straight games and topped the 40-point mark three times in that span.
Boston owns the best record in the NBA at 24-10, and the team looks ready to make another trip to the NBA Finals.
Tatum and the Celtics will go for their third straight win when they host the Houston Rockets (9-23) on Tuesday.

Tatum was complimentary of Giannis Antetokounmpo, who still scored 27 points despite the Celtics throwing every available defender his way.
“We know they’re a team we’re going to see pretty often, and Giannis is, if not the best, one of the best players in the league today.
“It’s fun playing on national TV, it’s fun playing on Christmas,” Tatum said.
You get to play against the other best players, and it just raises your level of play.
