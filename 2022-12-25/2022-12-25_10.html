     Monday Night Football: Matt Ryan officially a healthy scratch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Colts will start their third quarterback of the season and their seventh since the start of the 2019 season when Andrew Luck unexpectedly retired.
Nick Foles gets the nod on Monday Night Football, the sixth team for whom the quarterback has made at least one start.
Matt Ryan is the third-string quarterback and a healthy scratch.
That’s likely the case for the rest of the season as the Colts need Ryan healthy to release him after the season.
Their inactives are quarterback Easton Stick, running back Sony Michel, receiver Michael Bandy, offensive tackle Storm Norton, safety JT Woods and running back Isaiah Spiller.

     Colts QB Matt Ryan inactive for ‘MNF’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colts QB Matt Ryan inactive for ‘MNF’Indianapolis Colts quarterback Matt Ryan is a healthy inactive for Monday night’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers, with Sam Ehlinger pegged to back up new starter Nick Foles.
Nick Foles was tabbed last week to be the Colts’ starter for the final three games of the season.
For the Chargers, QB Easton Stick, RB Sony Michel, S JT Woods, RB Isaiah Spiller, T Storm Norton and WR Michael Bandy are inactive for the game.
Indianapolis acquired Ryan in a trade with the Atlanta Falcons in the offseason, hoping he’d lead what was perceived as a playoff-ready team deep into the postseason.
3 overall pick by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2008 draft, Ryan is 4-7-1 as a starter this season.

     Why is Matt Ryan not playing tonight for Colts vs. Chargers on MNF?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Indianapolis Colts are playing against the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday Night Football, and Matt Ryan isn't under center for the home side.
Former Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles is playing quarterback for the Colts, leaving fans wondering why Ryan, the team's starting quarterback since interim head coach Jeff Saturday took over, isn't on the field.
After last week's disastrous outing against the Minnesota Vikings, where the Colts blew a 33-0 halftime lead and let Kirk Cousins and co. set a new record for the biggest comeback in NFL history, the team decided to bench Matt Ryan.
Zak Keefer @zkeefer Probably won't see Matt Ryan play the rest of the year.

     How Matt Ryan's season with the Colts fell apart
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yes, Matt Ryan seemed like an ideal solution for a team with a massive quarterback dilemma and no obvious answers.
There was reason to believe Matt Ryan was the perfect fit for the Colts, but it didn't take long for reality to change that narrative.
Ryan's 5.5 yards per attempt in the game matched a season low and was symbolic of the punchless Colts offense.
Not all of Ryan's problems were of his own making, as the Colts' offensive line struggled throughout the season.
Taking it a bit further, the four lowest adjusted QBR marks of Ryan's career have each come in the past four seasons, suggesting the decline began long ago.
