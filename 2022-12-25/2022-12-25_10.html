     ‘Better days to come’: Christmas wishes from 1865 – Medford News, Weather, Sports, Breaking News
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: y“&gt;Because the surrounding woods reached into the backyard of nearly every resident, the Ashland committee tasked with finding a Christmas tree for the town’s 1865 celebration didn’t have to look far.
Tables and walls were decorated with local Christmas greenery: ferns, Oregon grapes and strategically placed mistletoe.
On the tree, strings of popcorn swirled up and down the branches, along with twisted strings of colored paper in the middle.
Reverend Johnson, a Methodist minister and friend who stayed with the Russells when he came to town, persuaded Ann to relent and accept her appointment.
“Oh, the wasted calico on those strings,” Ann said.

     A Cardinals Christmas Wish List - An Open Thread
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I don’t have anything too long for you today, but since we should all be in the spirit of Christmas, I have a St. Louis Cardinals Christmas wish list to share with all of you.
If he can’t hit enough to stay in the lineup, the Cardinals will have to sacrifice defense to play someone else.
That leaves the upcoming 2023 season as a competition for the young arms to see who can establish himself as a major league starting pitcher.
Nolan Gorman and Alec Burleson - Left-Handed Power BatThere’s been plenty of talk this offseason about how the Cardinals need a left-handed bat.
I would love to see him crush Triple-A, improve his defense and work his way onto the roster at some point during the season because, selfishly, I’m really really excited to watch him play.
