     Dozens of Chinese warplanes cross Taiwan median line
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Between 6am Sunday and 6am Monday, 47 of the Chinese planes crossed the median of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial boundary once tacitly accepted by both sides, according to Taiwan’s defence ministry.
Taiwan said it monitored the Chinese moves using its land-based missile systems and navy vessels.
Shi was referring to the US defence spending bill, which calls China a strategic challenge.
China’s military has often used large military exercises as a demonstration of force in response to US government actions in support of Taiwan.
It conducted large live-fire military exercises in August in response to US House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.

     Taiwan Reports China's Largest Incursion yet to Air Defense Zone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Seventy-one Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone in the past 24 hours, the island's government said on Monday, the largest reported incursion to date.
The incursion included 43 Chinese aircraft that crossed the Taiwan Strait's median line, an unofficial buffer between the two sides that lies within the defense zone, Taiwan'sDefense Ministry said in a report, as Beijing continues military activities close to the Chinese-claimed island.
Taiwan, which strongly rejects China's sovereignty claims, said the drills showed Beijing was destroying regional peace and trying to cow Taiwan's people.
Some of the Chinese planes, mostly fighter jets, briefly crossed the median line in the sensitive Taiwan Strait before returning to China, according to a map provided by Taiwan's defense ministry.
Taipei has complained of repeated missions by the Chinese air force over the last two years, often in southern areas of its ADIZ.

     China stages ‘strike drills’ around Taiwan, citing provocation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Taiwan accuses Beijing of destroying regional peace and trying to cow its people.
China’s military says it has conducted “strike drills” in the sea and airspace around Taiwan in response to what it says is provocation from the democratically governed island and the United States.
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, said the drills on Sunday showed Beijing was attacking regional peace and trying to cow Taiwan’s people.
In a brief statement, the Eastern Theatre Command of the Chinese army said it had carried out “joint combat readiness patrols and joint firepower strike drills” around Taiwan.
The Chinese drills coincided with newly elected mayors and county chiefs taking up their positions in Taiwan following local elections last month, in which the ruling Democratic Progressive Party was trounced.

     China sends 47 aircraft across Taiwan Strait and coducts military drills near Japan

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It added that a total of 71 Chinese aircraft were spotted around the island, and that Taiwan’s military have responded by tasking combat air patrol aircrafts, navy vessels, and land-based missile systems.
The flights, part of a so-called “strike drill” according to China’s military, follow Naval exercises by a Chinese aircraft carrier group in the Western Pacific close to Japan on Friday.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan – a democratically governed island of 24 million – as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it.
Drills near JapanLast Friday, China also conducted a series of military drills close to Japan’s southern Okinawa island in the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese authorities.
Tensions between China and Japan have also been rising steadily, with Beijing growing its naval and air forces in areas near Japan.
