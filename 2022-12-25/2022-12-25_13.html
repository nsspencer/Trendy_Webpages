     Summary: Busloads of migrants dropped off near Kamala Harris's home on Christmas EveEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty ImagesSeveral busloads of migrants were dropped off outside of the Washington, D.C., residence of Vice President Kamala Harris on Christmas Eve — apparently the latest in an escalating battle between state officials and the Biden administration over the country's immigration policy.
A total of three busloads of migrants arrived at the Naval Observatory, where Harris lives, on Saturday evening, WTOP reported.
Greg Abbott, said his state is purposefully busing migrants to sanctuary cities, where law enforcement are discouraged from deporting immigrants.
Two previous busloads of migrants arrived at Harris' residence in September, following an interview in which Harris said the border was secure.
With perilous temperatures moving into the area, many of these migrants are at risk of freezing to death on city streets."

     Summary: Three busloads of migrants were dropped off outside the Washington DC home of US vice-president Kamala Harris late on Christmas Eve, the latest episode in an escalating battle between the Joe Biden White House and the governors of southern Republican states over federal immigration policy.
Texas’s far-right governor, Greg Abbott, has previously sent buses to Harris’s Naval Observatory home.
“It really does show the cruelty behind governor Abbott and his insistence on continuing to bus people here without care about people arriving late at night on Christmas Eve when the weather is so cold,” Fischer said.
“Christmas Eve and freezing cold weather is no different,” Laborde told CNN.
Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis and Arizona’s governor Doug Ducey have also transported migrants to cities that are run by Democrats.

     Summary: Democrats are blasting the busing of migrants to Vice President Harris’s Washington, D.C., residence on Christmas Eve, taking aim at Texas Gov.
But it will likely intensify the feud over immigration, especially as Title 42 hangs in the balance.
The Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network, a local aid group, took the migrants to a church to receive assistance, according to ABC 7.
Ron DeSantis (R) flew two planes of migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts in September.
“With cold temperatures gripping Texas, your inaction to secure the southern border is putting the lives of migrants at risk, particularly in the City of El Paso,” Abbott wrote.
