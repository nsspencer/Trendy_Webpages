     Taiwan Reports China's Largest Incursion yet to Air Defense Zone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Seventy-one Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone in the past 24 hours, the island's government said on Monday, the largest reported incursion to date.
The incursion included 43 Chinese aircraft that crossed the Taiwan Strait's median line, an unofficial buffer between the two sides that lies within the defense zone, Taiwan'sDefense Ministry said in a report, as Beijing continues military activities close to the Chinese-claimed island.
Taiwan, which strongly rejects China's sovereignty claims, said the drills showed Beijing was destroying regional peace and trying to cow Taiwan's people.
Some of the Chinese planes, mostly fighter jets, briefly crossed the median line in the sensitive Taiwan Strait before returning to China, according to a map provided by Taiwan's defense ministry.
Taipei has complained of repeated missions by the Chinese air force over the last two years, often in southern areas of its ADIZ.

I do think that you can put some guardrails on the US china relationship.
The question is, are the Chinese going to be satisfied with that.
The Chinese have never bought into the idea of the us China relationship as being *** competitive one.
I don't think it's broken any new ground and we'll see how china reacts to future engagement by the U. S. With Taiwan.

     Taiwan says China deployed 71 warplanes in weekend war drills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: China deployed 71 warplanes in weekend military exercises around Taiwan, Taipei's defence ministry said Monday, including dozens of fighter jets in one of the biggest daily incursions to date.
Data from Taiwan's defence ministry showed those drills were one of the largest since they started releasing daily tallies.
In a post on Twitter, Taiwan said 60 fighter jets took part in the drills, including six Su-30 warplanes, some of China's most advanced.
One of the pressure tactics China has increasingly used is probing Taiwan's ADIZ with its warplanes.
It overlaps part of China's ADIZ and even includes some of the mainland.
