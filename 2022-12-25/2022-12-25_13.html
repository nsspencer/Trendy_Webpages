     China conducts 'strike drills' in sea, airspace around Taiwan citing provocation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: China on Sunday staged "strike drills" around Taiwan's airspace, saying it was conducted in response to the provocation from the self-governed island and the US, Al Jazeera reported.
The Chinese army's Eastern Theatre Command stated in a terse statement that it had conducted "combined combat readiness patrols and joint firepower strike drills" surrounding Taiwan.
Responding to the situation, Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory, said the drills on Sunday demonstrated Beijing's assault on regional peace and attempt to intimidate Taiwan's people, according to Al Jazeera.
The trip of the US House Speaker to the self-governed island not only heightened US-China tensions but also resulted in the escalation of tensions in the Taiwan Strait.
Pelosi was the first speaker of the house to come to Taiwan in 25 years since Newt Gingrich in 1997.

     After blasting U.S. defense aid to Taiwan, China begins military exercises around island it claims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: China launched naval and airpower exercises around Taiwan on Sunday, a day after officials in Beijing blasted the Biden administration for an $858 billion defense bill that authorized additional security assistance for the self-ruling island that China claims.
China blamed increased tensions that triggered the air and naval drills on “escalations of provocations” from the U.S. operating in collusion with Taiwan.
A senior military spokesman said the U.S. doesn’t have the right to insert itself into the question.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022 resulted in protests from China, which quickly ordered military exercises around the island.
“Nothing about the visit changed one iota of the U.S. government’s policy toward Taiwan or China.

     China stages 'strike drills' around Taiwan, citing provocation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/Tyrone SiuBEIJING/TAIPEI, Dec 25 (Reuters) - China's military said it had conducted "strike drills" in the sea and airspace around Taiwan on Sunday in response to what it said was provocation from the democratically-governed island and the United States.
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, said the drills showed Beijing was destroying regional peace and trying to cow Taiwan's people.
"This is a resolute response to the current escalation of collusion and provocation from the United States and Taiwan," it added, without giving details.
Taiwan has complained of repeated Chinese military activity nearby over the last three years or so as Beijing seeks to pressure Taipei to accept Chinese sovereignty.
The United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties.

     How Will Japan Prepare for a Taiwan Contingency?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Taiwan Emergency Makes Japan a “Front-Line State”Some in the US government have begun to express concern that Xi Jinping’s timetable for advancing on Taiwan has accelerated.
Xi Jinping may well be thinking, “If not now, when?” The prospect of a Taiwan contingency is becoming increasingly real.
The extent of the damage Japan suffers ultimately depends on how prepared for this contingency Japan is.
Increasing defense spending should also be discussed when taking into account Japan’s wider budget and spending priorities.
