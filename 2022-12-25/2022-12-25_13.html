     China stages ‘strike drills’ around Taiwan, citing provocation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: China conducts ‘strike drills’ around Taiwan in protest against US defence support for self-ruled island.
China’s military says it has conducted “strike drills” in the sea and airspace around Taiwan in response to what it says is provocation from the democratically governed island and the United States.
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, said the drills on Sunday showed Beijing was attacking regional peace and trying to cow Taiwan’s people.
In a brief statement, the Eastern Theatre Command of the Chinese army said it had carried out “joint combat readiness patrols and joint firepower strike drills” around Taiwan.
Taiwan has complained of repeated Chinese military activity near the island over the past three years as Beijing seeks to pressure Taipei to accept Chinese sovereignty.

     Summary: A Taiwan Emergency Makes Japan a “Front-Line State”Some in the US government have begun to express concern that Xi Jinping’s timetable for advancing on Taiwan has accelerated.
Xi Jinping may well be thinking, “If not now, when?” The prospect of a Taiwan contingency is becoming increasingly real.
The extent of the damage Japan suffers ultimately depends on how prepared for this contingency Japan is.
Increasing defense spending should also be discussed when taking into account Japan’s wider budget and spending priorities.
