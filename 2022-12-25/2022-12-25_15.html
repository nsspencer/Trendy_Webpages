     George Kittle thinks “absolute monster” Nick Bosa secured defensive player of the year Saturday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThere are a few games left in Week 16 and two full weeks left in the regular season, but 49ers tight end George Kittle thinks one award race has already come to an end.
49ers defensive end Nick Bosa had two sacks, four quarterback hits, and a forced fumble in Saturday’s 37-20 win over the Commanders.
He now has 17.5 sacks, 42 quarterback hits, and two forced fumbles during a season that Kittle believes should end with his teammate taking home the defensive player of the year award.
“I think today secured his defensive MVP,” Kittle said, via Nick Wagoner of ESPN.com.
Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons is likely his top competition for defensive player of the year, but it feels like Kittle is right about where things are headed with the final stretch of the season left to go.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Karl Rasmussen · 2 min readSan Francisco 49ers EDGE rusher Nick Bosa has been an absolute dog in the trenches this year, and he’s gained some major praise from his teammates in the process.
After Bosa helped lead the Niners to a victory over the Washington Commanders on Christmas Eve, star tight end George Kittle said his teammate has “secured” the Defensive Player of the Year award, over the likes of Cowboys’ Micah Parsons and Chiefs’ Chris Jones.
Kittle said of Bosa, via Nick Wagoner of ESPN:“I think today secured his defensive MVP.
He sacked Taylor Heinicke twice, recorded two tackles for loss, and had four QB hits, serving as a constant headache for the Commanders QB.
On the year, Nick Bosa is now up to 17.5 sacks in just 14 games.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nick Sirianni will be your NFL Coach of the Year, despite his team losing its second game of the season yesterday.
Nick Bosa will be the NFL Defensive Player of the Year after the Commanders couldn’t stop him from rocking both Taylor Heinicke and Carson Wentz into 2023.
If anything, Bosa’s performance needs consideration for overall league MVP, despite Vegas’ assertion it’s a two-man, two-quarterback race between Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts.
It’s turned into a quarterback award, much like the Heisman Trophy, and the NFL MVP should’ve gone to Cooper Kupp last season.
Sirianni’s offensive system looked so good without Hurts, it’s the best case Mahomes has for NFL MVP.

     Summary: 49ers pass rusher Nick Bosa took hold of the NFL lead in sacks on Saturday with a pair of QB takedowns in San Francisco's 37-20 victory over the Commanders.
Teammate George Kittle believes it's time to give Bosa his recognition following another dominant performance in 2022.
"I think today secured his defensive MVP," Kittle said after the NIners' win on Saturday, via ESPN.
"I feel like I have an answer for every type of blocker at this point," said Bosa after the win.
The 25-year-old has a better shot at rewriting the 49ers' history books with Aldon Smith's 19.5-sack team record well within his sights.
