    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Talk about the four horsemen of the apocalypse in M. Night Shyamalan’s Knock at the Cabin.

     Is ‘Knock At The Cabin’ The Next Great Horror Movie?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Knock at the Cabin” looks like it’s going to be a very sinister experience for viewers.
M. Night Shyamalan is known as one of the best mystery/horror filmmakers in the world, and it’s very possible this could be his next big hit.
Will “Knock at the Cabin” be a hit or a bomb?
Of course, there’s also a bit of a worry here because M. Night Shyamalan has also dropped some less than stellar films.

     Knock at the Cabin Trailer 2 Sees the Fate of the World Resting on a Choice
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new trailer for M. Night Shyamalan’s Knock at the Cabin dropped on Christmas Day, bringing a new look at the director’s upcoming apocalyptic feature.
Knock at the Cabin is very much typical Shyamalan territory, with some big mysterious and terrifying event happening over the course of the movie that has a potentially supernatural twist.
Signs would have had that title prior to Knock at the Cabin.
He previously said:“I was really taken by what Denis [Villeneuve] and Dave [Bautista] did in that scene in Blade Runner [2049].
There’s a type of stillness where you’re not doing nothing; you’re doing everything and you’re still.

     Full trailer for M. Night Shyamalan’s ‘Knock at the Cabin’ released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Back in September, Universal Pictures released an unnerving teaser for Knock at the Cabin, an upcoming horror/thriller film based on Paul Tremblay’s exceptional 2018 novel, The Cabin at the End of the World.
On Christmas, Universal Pictures gifted us with a full trailer for Knock at the Cabin that gives a significantly better outline of the story.
Instead, we immediately see them being menaced by a quartet of armed intruders led by a man named Leonard (Dave Bautista).
According to Leonard, the family must choose one of their own to be sacrificed to avoid the end of the world.
Knock at the Cabin debuts in theaters on February 3, 2023.
