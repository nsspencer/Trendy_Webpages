     China sends 71 warplanes toward Taiwan after US passes defense bill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The drill was a response to a U.S.-Taiwan “provocation," China said.
HONG KONG and TAIPEI -- China on Monday flew 71 warplanes into Taiwan’s air defense zone, as part of a drill that included 47 planes crossing the de-facto maritime border between the mainland and the island.
The 47 aircraft crossed the median line in the Taiwan Strait, entering into Taiwan’s southwest air defense zone at about 6 a.m. local time, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said.
President Joe Biden on Dec. 23 signed the National Defense Authorization Act for 2023, a bill that included funding for Taiwan, along with support for its “meaningful participation” in the international community.
Taiwanese flags are seen at the Ministry of National Defence of Taiwan in Taipei, Taiwan, Dec. 26, 2022.

     Taiwan reports China's largest incursion yet to air defense zone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: J-20 stealth fighter jets fly during training for the 14th Airshow China in Guangdong province on Nov. 5, 2022.
Seventy-one Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone in the past 24 hours, the island's government said on Monday, the largest reported incursion to date.
Of the aircraft, 43 also crossed the Taiwan Strait's median line, an unofficial buffer between the two sides that lies within the defense zone, Taiwan's Defense Ministry said in a report, as Beijing continues military activities close to the Chinese-claimed island.
Taiwan's official Central News Agency said it was the largest Chinese air force incursion to date, although there was no sense of alarm on the island, which has witnessed a steady increase in Chinese pressure in recent years.
Taiwan, which strongly rejects China's sovereignty claims, said the drills showed Beijing was destroying regional peace and trying to intimidate Taiwan's people.
