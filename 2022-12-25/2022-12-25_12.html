     Summary: Among the planes China sent towards Taiwan were 18 J-16 fighter jets, 11 J-1 fighters, 6 Su-30 fighters and drones.
Taiwan said it monitored the Chinese moves through its land-based missile systems, as well as on its own navy vessels.
It announced that the PLA was holding joint combat patrols and joint strike drills in the waters around Taiwan.
China’s military has often used large military exercises as a demonstration of force in response to U.S. government actions in support of Taiwan.
It conducted large live-fire military exercises in August in response to U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.

     Taiwan reports China's largest incursion yet to air defense zone

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: J-20 stealth fighter jets fly during training for the 14th Airshow China in Guangdong province on Nov. 5, 2022.
Seventy-one Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone in the past 24 hours, the island's government said on Monday, the largest reported incursion to date.
Of the aircraft, 43 also crossed the Taiwan Strait's median line, an unofficial buffer between the two sides that lies within the defense zone, Taiwan's Defense Ministry said in a report, as Beijing continues military activities close to the Chinese-claimed island.
Taiwan's official Central News Agency said it was the largest Chinese air force incursion to date, although there was no sense of alarm on the island, which has witnessed a steady increase in Chinese pressure in recent years.
Taiwan, which strongly rejects China's sovereignty claims, said the drills showed Beijing was destroying regional peace and trying to intimidate Taiwan's people.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HONG KONG — The Chinese military sent 71 aircraft and seven ships toward Taiwan in a 24-hour period, Taiwan’s government said Monday, in its biggest show of force since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island earlier this year.
The aggression toward the self-ruling democracy, which Beijing claims as its territory, came after the Chinese government objected to a U.S. defense spending bill passed on Friday that includes greater support for Taiwan’s military.
The ministry said 47 of the planes crossed the median line, an unofficial boundary in the Taiwan Strait.
Taiwan said its military was monitoring the situation using planes, ships and land-based missile systems, adding that the Chinese drills were an effort to intimidate the people of Taiwan, who strongly reject Beijing’s claims of sovereignty.
Its planes have crossed the median line more regularly and in greater numbers since the visit by Pelosi in August.

     Classical trash: how Taiwan’s musical bin lorries transformed ‘garbage island’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the last few decades, Taiwan has transformed itself from “garbage island” to one of the world’s best managers of household trash, and it’s done so with a soundtrack.
The “garbage doesn’t touch the ground” policy requires residents to bring trash directly out of their homes to the trucks, resulting in more hygienic streets in Taiwan’s sweaty climate.
Nothing says it’s Pride weekend in Taipei more than a drag queen death dropping to a club remix of Taiwan’s bin collection song.
pic.twitter.com/vUVnnKVuoC — James Chater (@james_chater) October 29, 2022In November, video clips from a drag show during Taipei Pride went viral.
Fancier high-rises pay building managers to take care of residents’ garbage, but it still doesn’t let them escape the jingle.
