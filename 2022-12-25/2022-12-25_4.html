     Summary: by Leo Sells | Commanders Correspondent | Sun, Dec 25th 11:40am ESTTaylor Heinicke completed 13 of his 18 pass attempts for 166 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception before being benched in favor of Carson Wentz in Saturday's 37-20 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.
Fantasy Impact:Heinicke was benched in the fourth-quarter in favor of veteran Carson Wentz, and it's unclear who the starter will be moving forward.
He didn't have a terrible game, but the team needed a spark and wanted to see what Wentz could do.
Fantasy managers should pay attention to this developing situation in Washington to see who will be at the helm moving forward.

     Commanders QB Taylor Heinicke on Week 16 benching vs. 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Gerard Angelo Samillano · 2 min readA couple of weeks ago, it seemed like Taylor Heinicke had the Washington Commanders’ QB1 role locked up.
After a string of solid performances, the team announced that he’d be the starting QB even after Carson Wentz’ return.
However, in Week 16, Heinicke was benched by the Commanders in the fourth quarter against the San Francisco 49ers.
Taylor Heinicke: “Starting the fourth, obviously, that’s not how you want to start the fourth quarter, but they (Commanders) made the decision to put Carson in.
It will be interesting to see if Taylor Heinicke’s benching in Week 16 means that Carson Wentz will be the full-time starter for the Commanders.

     Back-to-back losses leave Commanders in QB quandary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Back-to-back losses haven’t knocked Washington out of playoff position just yet.
The question is which quarterback coach Ron Rivera will turn to to get the Commanders into the postseason.
Heinicke threw two TD passes to keep the Commanders in the game until the fourth quarter before his fumble and interception led to the game getting out of hand.
“I thought he played pretty good,” Rivera said.
“The start of the fourth, obviously that’s not how you want to start the fourth quarter.

     Carson Wentz thankful for the relationship he has with Taylor Heinicke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Commanders benched Taylor Heinicke in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s loss to the 49ers and replaced him with former starter Carson Wentz.
While Heinicke was upset, he was the first person to congratulate Wentz after his touchdown pass.
Wentz admitted he wasn’t sure where head coach Ron Rivera would turn, but he would support Heinicke if he were the choice, and Heinicke would also support Wentz.
When Rivera named Heinicke the quarterback once Wentz was ready to return, Wentz was the ultimate professional.
If you remember, it was said that Wentz wasn’t a great teammate at his two previous stops, a notion that many of his former teammates have disputed.

     The Commanders need a jolt at quarterback. Will Carson Wentz do?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Taylor Heinicke, the backup quarterback with a combo of magnetism and football character that often surpasses his talent, scraped his head against his ceiling so often Saturday that the Washington Commanders benched him.
The Commanders just went 0-2-1 in December, dropping Rivera’s record as Washington’s coach during this critical month to 3-6-1.
But now that teams have gotten used to them again, the Commanders are in need of further revision.
Then, in the middle of an otherwise efficient game, Heinicke committed two turnovers in a three-play span, which led to two field goals that increased the 49ers’ lead to 30-14.
“When the game got to where it was, the last thing we wanted was for them to tee off on [Heinicke],” Rivera said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Down 21-14 in the fourth quarter, Heinicke was sacked and fumbled in the process, giving the 49ers terrific field position.
On the second play of the next drive, Heinicke, under pressure, is intercepted, leading to another field goal, and the Niners went up 27-14.
Just as Heinicke stated last week, if the Commanders chose to return to Wentz, Heinicke would approach each game by being the “best backup” he could be.
Heinicke and Wentz both represent a positive culture, always supporting one another, even enjoying the holidays together.
If so, Heinicke will do everything in his power to help Wentz and the team prepare.
