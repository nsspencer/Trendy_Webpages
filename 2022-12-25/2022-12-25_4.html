     Watch: Russell Wilson throws two interceptions, Broncos down big early
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is not the Christmas that Broncos fans wanted in Los Angeles.
QB Russell Wilson has thrown not one, but two interceptions.
Even worse, L.A. has turned them both into touchdowns after a couple of short offensive series, and Denver already trails 17-0.

But, for now, Christmas is off to a brutal start.

     Rams up 10-0 after Russell Wilson interception
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesBroncos quarterback Russell Wilson‚Äòs return from a concussion is off to a poor start.
Wilson‚Äôs second pass of Sunday‚Äôs game against the Rams was picked off by rookie cornerback Cobie Durant in Broncos territory and Los Angeles was able to take advantage.
Baker Mayfield hit tight end Tyler Higbee on back-to-back plays and the second completion went for a nine-yard score.
The Rams also drove for a field goal to open the game, so they now lead 10-0 with just over six minutes to play in the first quarter.
Mayfield is 5-of-5 for 50 yards and Cam Akers has six carries for 40 yards, but a fumbled shotgun snap stopped the momentum on the first possession and forced the team to settle for a 55-yard Matt Gay kick.

     Russell Wilson Throws INT, Roasted By Patrick From SpongeBob
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is hard for Russell Wilson‚Äôs first season as a member of the Denver Broncos to go any worse.
Having said that, things might have hit a new low on Christmas Day during the team‚Äôs game against the Los Angeles Rams, as Wilson threw an abysmal interception to Bobby Wagner and got absolutely roasted by Patrick Star from SpongeBob SquarePants on Nickelodeon‚Äôs broadcast of the game.
Patrick Star really has a future as a play-by-play announcer.
This happened while Patrick, SpongeBob‚Äôs lovably dumb neighbor who lives under a rock, was providing play-by-play on the Nickmas Game.
After the pick, Patrick decided to crack a joke at the former Pro Bowl signal caller‚Äôs expense based on the let Russ cook meme.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos and quarterback Russell Wilson probably envisioned the 2022 season going differently when the franchise traded for him this past off-season.
Wilson returned to the lineup this week, though without his customary ‚ÄúBroncos Country, let‚Äôs ride!‚Äù ending at his weekly press conference.
Wilson and the Broncos faced Baker Mayfield and the Los Angeles Rams on Christmas.
The Broncos surrendered two first-round and two second-round picks as part of the package for Wilson.
The Rams led the Broncos, 24-3, midway through the second quarter as Mayfield outdueled Wilson to start the game.

     Patrick Star And Tony Romo Roast The Shit Out Of Russell Wilson After His Second 1st-Quarter Interception
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I love that this Nickelodeon simulcast, featuring SpongeBob's faithful sidekick Patrick Star, can even recognize and talk shit about how non-DangeRuss the flailing Denver Broncos quarterback is.
One of the biggest plot twists in NFL history during my lifetime has been the complete and utter reversal of how everyone perceives Russell Wilson.
Had to resort to NFL Brasil's Twitter to find the extended clip of Tony Romo blasting Wilson for what he calls a "predetermined look-off".
What an absolute lump of coal Broncos fans received this season and on this fine Christmas Day.
Instead, they've seen their defense ball out and Russ fail to put up 20 points way more often than not.

     Summary: In perhaps one of the least anticipated Christmas Day games featuring two 4-10 NFL teams, Russell Wilson and the Denver Broncos got off to a rough start against the Los Angeles Rams.
And the Rams made Wilson and co. pay, scoring touchdowns following each pick and grabbing a 17-0 lead before the end of the first quarter.
On 3rd-and-9 on the Broncos‚Äô own 26-yard line, Wilson tried to connect with Courtland Sutton but was instead picked off by Cobie Durant.

But Patrick wasn‚Äôt the only one to torch Wilson for these mistakes.

Wilson is likely to improve at some point, especially if the Broncos switch things up with play-calling.
