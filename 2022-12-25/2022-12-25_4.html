     Sean McVay‚Äôs Baker Mayfield take will hype up Rams fans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa ¬∑ 2 min readThe Los Angeles Rams may be out of the playoff race, but Baker Mayfield continues to give fans a reason to watch the team.
With that said, it‚Äôs not a surprise why head coach Sean McVay has glowing praises for his new quarterback.
Mayfield led the Rams once again as they destroyed Russell Wilson and the Denver Broncos during their Christmas Day showdown.
With Matthew Stafford expected to return from his injury next season, it‚Äôs likely that Mayfield is signing elsewhere in the offseason.
However, he has certainly given Rams fans something to smile about amid a rather disastrous season.

     Baker Mayfield On Winning Nickelodeon Valuable Player: It‚Äôs A True Honor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Afterwards, Mayfield was presented with the vaunted NVP award, becoming the first winning quarterback to earn the honors as previous winners Dak Prescott and Mitchell Trubisky had lost in their NVP winning efforts.
Mayfield, who won the Heisman Trophy in college, was asked where the NVP ranked among his list of career accolades and he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs up there‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a true honor‚Äù which is an incredible quote about a blimp trophy..@bakermayfield is psyched to win NVP.
üíôüíõ And he also wants to slime @tutuatwell.
üòÇ pic.twitter.com/DxOqirLe9e ‚Äî NFL (@NFL) December 26, 2022I hope the NFL never stops doing Nickelodeon games because watching players speak earnestly about the NVP award and who they‚Äôd like to slime is far better than most any postgame interview in any sport.
I hope the blimp trophy earns a rightful, prominent placement in the Mayfield house.

     Rams-Chargers opening odds: Baker Mayfield back to being an underdog in Week 17
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But that hasn‚Äôt stopped people from betting against them in Week 17‚Äôs L.A. showdown with the Chargers.
The game‚Äôs over/under is set at 41 points, 10 points less than what the Rams scored on Christmas.
Mayfield went 24-of-28 for 230 yards and two touchdowns, the second-best completion percentage for a Rams quarterback ever.
If the Chargers win against one of the worst teams in the league, they will be 9-6 heading into next week‚Äôs game against the Rams.
Is eight points a fair spread for a Rams team that was so bad prior to Week 16?

     Baker Mayfield wins Nickelodeon Valuable Player award in Rams' 51-14 laugher vs. Broncos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Rams quarterback Baker Mayfield was awarded the Nickelodeon Valuable Player (NVP) trophy following his team's 51-14 blowout victory over the Denver Broncos.
The game was broadcast on Nickelodeon, as well as CBS, and as is tradition, the award was voted on by fans during the game.
The first of those two touchdown tosses came just a few minutes into the game, after Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson had thrown an early interception.
The second touchdown came early in the second quarter, and put the Rams up 24-3.
The Rams lost to the Green Bay Packers in his first start last week, before demolishing the Broncos on Sunday.

     Look: Riley Dixon thanks Baker Mayfield for not making him work on Christmas

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Riley Dixon has been busy this season for the Rams, punting 62 times in the team‚Äôs first 14 games.
The offense has been awful all year, but on Sunday, the Rams somehow put up 51 points against the Broncos.
After the game, Dixon had to thank Baker Mayfield for giving him the first no-punt game of his career.
Dixon still had to suit up and stand on the sideline all game long, but at least he didn‚Äôt have to work much on Christmas Day.
His only obligation was holding for Matt Gay nine times as he drilled three field goals and six PATs.
