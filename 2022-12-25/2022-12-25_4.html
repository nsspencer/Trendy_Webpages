     LeBron James' Lack of Help Called out by Lakers Fans in Loss to Luka Dončić, Mavs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ron Jenkins/Getty ImagesIt might take a Christmas miracle to save the 2022-23 Los Angeles Lakers.
Los Angeles' losing streak extended to four Sunday thanks to its 124-115 loss to the Dallas Mavericks in a Christmas Day showdown at American Airlines Center.
LeBron James carried his team with 38 points, six rebounds and five assists, but his supporting cast had nowhere near enough pieces to keep up with Luka Dončić and Co. on the road.
The Mavericks poured in 51 points in an overwhelming third quarter that saw Los Angeles counter with just 21.
Attention now turns to a road game against the Orlando Magic on Tuesday as the Lakers attempt to snap out of this sluggish stretch.

     Summary: With the win, Dallas improves to 18-16 on the season while Los Angeles falls to 13-20.
Mavericks explode in the third quarter to blow this game openThings couldn't get worse than what the Mavericks did in the first half against the Lakers.
They shot 39.5 percent from the field and 22.7 percent from 3-point range, and fell behind by 11 points to a Lakers team that was without Anthony Davis.
Especially when the team shoots 32.1 percent from 3-point range, a long standing issue for the Lakers this season.
