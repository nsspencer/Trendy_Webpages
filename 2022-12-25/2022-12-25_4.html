     Celtics Wrap: Jayson Tatum Gifts Bucks Loss On Christmas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — The Boston Celtics defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 139-118, on Christmas Day at TD Garden.
The Celtics improved to 24-10 while the Bucks fell to 22-11.
The Bucks, however, struggled mightily, with Antetokounmpo settling for shots outside of the paint early and often.
Milwaukee was forced to settle for the outside shot in the fourth quarter, trailing by 19 points at one point.
Antetokounmpo hit a few shots, but an offensive explosion from Jaylen Brown was enough to essentially seal the game for Boston.

     Summary: Brown scored 13 of his 29 points in the fourth, and Jayson Tatum scored 41 for Boston on Sunday to help the Celtics beat Milwaukee 139-118 in a matchup of the top two teams in the NBA.
Tatum scored 20 in the third quarter, when the Celtics turned a one-point lead into a 100-86 edge.
Asked about his team’s ability to limit the damage done by Antetokounmpo, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said, “Limiting’s crazy.
Brown missed all three free throws; he missed another in the third quarter before hitting the second and finished 2 for 6 from the line.
… Connaughton, a native of nearby Arlington, Massachusetts, made his first start of the season and scored 15.

Once again, the Bucks couldn’t buy one from distance against the Celtics, making just 11 of their 33 attempts.
While the Celtics went about making threes differently from the way they did in the playoffs, they still made more of them.
But after Smart gave Tatum the ball back, Antetokounmpo came over to challenge the Celtics' star at the rim.
