     Watch: Jalen Ramsey comes up with Rams' 3rd INT vs. Russell Wilson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It wasn’t a very merry Christmas for Russell Wilson in Sunday’s game against the Rams.
The Broncos quarterback turned this one into a pick-fest, throwing three interceptions in his first 17 pass attempts.
Jalen Ramsey came up with the Rams’ third interception, picking off Wilson in the third quarter on a deep shot for Greg Dulcich.
The tight end snuck behind the defense momentarily, but Ramsey made up plenty of ground and picked off the underthrown pass in the end zone to prevent a potential touchdown.
Cobie Durant and Bobby Wagner had the first two interceptions of the game, which each set up Rams touchdowns.

     Rams embarrass Broncos, 51-14: Instant analysis of Week 16 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Surely, everyone saw this one coming.
Everyone expected the Rams to absolutely steamroll the Broncos and their top-five defense on Christmas Day.
The Rams, who hadn’t scored more than 23 points since Week 6, put up 31 first-half points against the Broncos and cruised to a 51-14 win at SoFi Stadium on Sunday, improving their record to 5-10 despite remaining out of playoff contention.
It was a shocking result for a Rams team that has fielded one of the worst offenses in football all year, and despite the season being all but lost, Los Angeles showed a ton of heart and effort in this win over Denver.
Here’s a quick recap of how the game went and where the Rams go next.

     Summary: INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- The Los Angeles Rams (5-10) nabbed one of their easiest wins of the season on Christmas Day, as Russell Wilson and the Denver Broncos (4-11) suffered an embarrassing 51-14 loss on the road.
Rams running back Cam Akers scored three touchdowns to highlight a breakout day from him and the rest of L.A.'s offense.
His two interceptions on his first three pass attempts were each what-were-you-thinking throws that resulted in turnovers deep in Broncos territory.
The Rams scored two touchdowns off takeaways in the first quarter.
The Rams scored 17 points in the first quarter.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MATCHUPAs fans celebrate the holiday season, the Broncos (4-10) travel to sunny Los Angeles to face the Rams (4-10).
Led by quarterback Baker Mayfield with Matthew Stafford on injured reserve, the Rams have dealt with several key injuries on offense in the year after winning Super Bowl LVI.
Wide receivers Cooper Kupp and Allen Robinson II are on IR as well, as are several of their offensive linemen.
Denver's offense has shown improvement since its Week 14 game against Kansas City, and whether it can continue that progress will be key over the final stretch of the season.
WR Jerry Jeudy is playing at a high level entering Week 16, but he'll surely face a tough test against five-time Pro Bowl CB Jalen Ramsey.

     Summary: INGLEWOOD, Calif. — (AP) — Baker Mayfield threw two touchdown passes to Tyler Higbee, Cam Akers rushed for 118 yards and three more scores, and the Los Angeles Rams routed the Denver Broncos 51-14 Sunday for their second victory since mid-October.
For at least one more week, Los Angeles avoided becoming the first defending Super Bowl champion to lose 11 games.
Wagner then poached a pass from Wilson across the middle of the field and made a long return, and the Rams scored two snaps later on Akers' 3-yard run.
Los Angeles had scored just one touchdown off a takeaway all season long before doing it twice more in the first quarter.
Higbee made his second TD catch early in the second quarter after a smooth 75-yard drive by the Rams' long-struggling offense.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos were manhandled in Sunday’s Christmas Day game against the Los Angeles Rams.
Russell Wilson’s return meant very little for the Broncos’ offense which struggled against an Aaron Donald-less Rams defense, while Denver’s defense struggled to stop Baker Mayfield, Tyler Higbee, and the Rams’ offense.
In Sunday’s Christmas showdown with the Rams, Denver’s defense found itself up first against Baker Mayfield and the Rams’ offense.
On their first drive, the Broncos’ defense faced an early uptempo approach by Sean McVay and the Rams’ offense.
On top of that, the Broncos’ defense surrendered 388 yards on the day in their 51-14 loss.

     NFL flexes Rams-Chargers out of Sunday night slot in Week 17
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During Sunday’s game between the Los Angeles Rams and Denver Broncos, the NFL announced some scheduling news about the Rams’ next game.
The league is moving Rams-Chargers in Week 17 out of the Sunday night slot, with the Steelers-Ravens game taking that spot.
The Rams and Chargers will now play at 4:25 p.m.
With the Rams being out of playoff contention, it makes sense that the NFL would rather have a more meaningful game in prime time for the second-to-last week of the season.
Rams-Chargers was expected to be a great matchup before the season began, but the Rams have struggled with injuries and issues on offense all year, limping to a 4-10 record through 14 games.
