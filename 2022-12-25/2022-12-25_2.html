After the Raiders suffered their ninth loss of the season, in crushing fashion, Las Vegas’ running back Josh Jacobs shared his thoughts.
Prior to that last second remaining, with just over two minutes to go, ESPN gave Las Vegas a 71% win probability.
However, after watching the Raiders suffer another late-game collapse, Jacobs spoke with Vic Tarfur of The Athletic about his frustrations with Las Vegas’ season.
After Las Vegas declined his fifth-year option, Jacobs will be a free agent after the season.

“Yeah, man, it’s bullshit, for real,” Jacobs said after the game, via Vincent Bonsignore of the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
“We still had opportunities to make plays,” Jacobs said when asked whether the Steelers were focused on stopping the Las Vegas running game.
They ran the ball 19 times for 58 yards (three yards per carry) and passed the ball 30 times for 174 gross yards.
Barring the application of the franchise tag, Jacobs will be an unrestricted free agent in less than three months.
