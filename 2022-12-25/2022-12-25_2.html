     Memphis Grizzlies silenced by Golden State Warriors without Stephen Curry on Christmas Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO ― The Memphis Grizzlies were served a slice of humble pie for dessert on Christmas Day.
Memphis has been one of the top NBA teams this season, and a matchup against the Golden State Warriors is what the Grizzlies ordered.
For subscribers:The City Council went to lunch with the Memphis Grizzlies.
Ja Morant shines, but doesn't get much helpWhile Brooks and Jackson battled foul trouble, it was Morant who put the Grizzlies on his back.
Morant's scoring kept the Grizzlies in the game, but Memphis didn't get enough help for the majority of the night.

     Summary: Jordan Poole led the way with 32 points, his sixth 30-point game this season.

Poole responded with 12 points and the Warriors led by 15 points going in the fourth.
After receiving his second technical foul of the game, Poole was ejected at the 9:20 mark of the fourth quarter.

     Summary: "Some good, old-fashioned trash talk," Thompson said.
"It's always fun to talk trash.
Heading into the Warriors' Christmas Day 123-109 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, both sides were hesitant to call the relationship between them a rivalry.
There's been plenty of trash talk between the two teams over the past several months.
And unlike 10 years ago, when Thompson, 32, was early in his career, he said external trash talk doesn't impact him.

     How the Warriors outsmarted and upset the Grizzlies on Christmas Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — Maybe the biggest play of the Warriors’ short-handed 123-109 Christmas win over the Grizzlies came while half the crowd was still returning from the concourse.
Jaren Jackson Jr. was guarding Draymond Green, giving Green a green light to go foul hunting.
He knew Jackson’s foul total, importance to the Grizzlies and his maddening tendency to reach in moments when he shouldn’t.
We’re seasoned.”This profiled as a terrible time for the Warriors to get a motivated Grizzlies team, finally healthy after Desmond Bane’s recent return.
But — easier said in retrospect — it may actually prove to be the perfect time for the Warriors to have drawn the Grizzlies.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO – The bad blood brewing between the Warriors and Grizzlies boiled over into a fiesty Christmas Day rematch of the Western Conference semifinals Sunday, with the reigning champs dealing the Grizzlies a 123-109 loss on national television.
On a night filled with boisterous celebrations, Klay Thompson sent a message to the Grizzlies that the Warriors aren’t going anywhere anytime soon.
Golden State Warriors' Jordan Poole (3) goes up for a dunk against the Memphis Grizzlies in the third quarter at the Chase Center in San Francisco, Calif., on Sunday, Dec. 25, 2022.
The Grizzlies never recovered as the Warriors’ lead swelled to as big as 18 before the end of the third.
They’ll have one day off before returning to Chase Center Tuesday to host the 9-24 Charlotte Hornets.
