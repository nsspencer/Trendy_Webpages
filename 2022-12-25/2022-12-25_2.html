     Epic Games Store Replaces Death Stranding Director's Cut Free Game With Standard Version
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Epic Games Store has quickly pulled the Death Stranding: Director's Cut as its Christmas Day free game and replaced it with the standard version.
The crush to acquire today's free Epic Games Store gift temporarily crashed the storefront's servers, leaving many confused and frustrated.
Along the way, Epic Games added fuel to the fire by taking down Death Stranding: Director's Cut with no forewarning.
After around 90 minutes, however, Epic Games swapped out Death Stranding: Director's Cut, replacing it with the standard edition.
Either way, a free Epic Games Store copy of Death Stranding is still better than none at all.

     Today's Free Game Giveaway Is So Good It's Crashing The Epic Games Store
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As it so happens, today's free game is such a big draw that the Epic Games store had trouble keeping up with demand, at least initially.
Today's title that is up for grabs is Death Stranding.
Once you've claimed the game and completed the checkout process, it's yours to keep in your games catalog forever (or until the Epic Games store ceases to exist, anyway).
Death Stranding released to the PlayStation 4 three years ago, then was ported to PC in July 2020 (see our Death Stranding review ).
Your best bet is to send a daily reminder to check the Epic Games store at 11:00am, so you don't end up forgetting and missing out.
