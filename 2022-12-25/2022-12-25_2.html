     A Christmas Story: Remembering the Final Game at Municipal Stadium
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The defense was tops as was the kicking game with place kicker Jan Stenerud and punter Jerrel Wilson.
There was no surprise that Kansas City was considered a favorite to return to the Super Bowl.
The game turned out to be a rarity: a playoff hosted at Municipal.
The Chiefs had never played a home playoff game at Municipal and would not host one again in Kansas City until 1991.
"About the fifth quarter — it was already dark — Clark went to sleep, and he slept through the longest game.

     A Christmas Story: 60 years for a Northside Music story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: John owns Northside Music Co., one of the last major piano restoration shops still operating in the Midwest.
One of those stores was Northside Music, which had been in operating well before Mills started working at the business.
“I sometimes joke to customers that at Northside Music, we’re not necessarily bigger, stronger, faster, or better.
That level of commitment to every repair is the special ingredient to the Northside Music Co.'s success.
In the grand scheme of things, this is just one small concern for John and the future of Northside Music.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not much of a take for a full house at a Christmas show.
So after I got out of my red suit and rubber snoot I drove off to seek a worthy recipient.
I was in town with Faye and our daughter, getting in some Christmas shopping before we rendezvoused with my mom for supper.
I was headed for the liquor store on Eighth, thinking the spirit could use a little fortification.
He was a part-time fillet man from the Pike Place Market, up in Seattle, on his way to spend Christmas with family on “the rez,” outside of Albuquerque.
