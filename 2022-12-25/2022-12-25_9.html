     4 Reasons the Phoenix Suns are struggling in December
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is little doubt that this December has not been one to remember for the Phoenix Suns, as the team is suffering and losing for several reasons.
The Phoenix Suns started the season well and were carried by outstanding individual contributions in November.
The injuries are mounting for the Phoenix SunsWhen the season started, we knew there would be at least a few games lost to injury.
Dario Saric has had limited availability as he recovers from a significant injury, and wings Josh Okogie and Torrey Craig have missed games with injuries.
If healthy, the Suns can compete; however, they haven’t been and, as a result, have struggled in several areas as a team.

     3 things Phoenix Suns must fix in the new year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsThe New Year is right around the corner, and the Phoenix Suns need the resolution to turn things around.
The Suns have had a rough patch, which is why some things need to change in order for them to get back on the winning track.
Phoenix is coming off a loss against the Denver Nuggets as they capped off the five-game Christmas Day schedule.
As the New Year is slowly approaching, some things need fixing to help the Suns’ season.
Maybe the Suns are waiting until the trade deadline on February 9, but it’ll be better if they find a trade early in 2023.
