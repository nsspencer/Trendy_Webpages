     How many episodes is The Witcher: Blood Origin?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Witcher: Blood Origin was supposed to be the far-reaching story of some of the most important moments of the universe’s world, including the Conjunction of the Spheres and the creation of the first witcher.
But what may shock fans more than the series’ quality is that such a massive-seeming prequel was attempted in just four total episodes, the final count for the Netflix miniseries.
That isn’t too surprising, given that the series was originally announced as having a total of six episodes.
But with so much meat left on the bone, it’s always possible that the Witcher universe could return to this time period, and maybe spend a little more than four episodes there next time.
From everything we know, Blood Origin is just a miniseries, so we shouldn’t expect to see a second season.

     The Witcher: Blood Origin’s ending explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Witcher: Blood Origin, a four-episode limited series that premiered on December 25th, serves as a prequel aimed at answering some of the series’ biggest questions.
Starring an ensemble led by Sophia Brown and Laurence O’Fuarain, The Witcher: Blood Origin takes place during the Golden Age of elves on the Continent.
Although Blood Origin feels a tad by the numbers and rushed, the show still serves as an effective and occasionally riveting expansion of The Witcher‘s mythology.
However, Blood Origin reveals there is someone there: Avallac’h, a young mage apprentice who acted as Merwyn’s advisor throughout the show.
The Witcher: Blood Origin is now streaming on Netflix.

     ‘The Witcher: Blood Origin’ Ending Explained: Of Poets, Prophecies, and Perilous Plans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Editor's note: The below contains spoilers for The Witcher: Blood Origin.While The Witcher: Blood Origin is set 1200 years before the events of The Witcher, the prequel still leaves many untied threads the main series will definitely explore in the future.
Unfortunately, The Witcher: Blood Origin feels rushed and bloated for trying to fit so many important plot points and key characters in just four episodes.
So, let’s break down what happens in The Witcher: Blood Origin’s ending and explain what all of that means for the future.
Blood Origin tells the origin story of the Wild Hunt’s leader, Eredin (Jacob Collins-Levy).
The Witcher: Blood Origin is available now on Netflix.

     The Witcher: Blood Origin Finale Recap: You Say You Want a Revolution
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Witcher: Blood Origin never promised much suspense.
That would seem to be the most consequential thing happening, but Blood Origin spreads itself generously around our other heroes.
Like much of Blood Origin, this promising character suffers from scant screen time and generally being underwritten, but there’s a tragic arc here that’s worth parsing.
When Ithlinne touches her belly, she delivers a prophecy about a future child of Éile’s blood, “singing the last.” There are a few ways to read this, but Blood Origin decides to save them for the future, leaving us — and Jakier — in the dark.
I’ll say this for Blood Origin: Even if this odd little chapter of the Witcher universe wasn’t exactly a riveting page-turner, it has me plenty curious for the next story.
