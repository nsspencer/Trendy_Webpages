     James Harden mulling free agent return to Rockets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adrian Wojnarowski reports that James Harden would be open to a reunion if he leaves the 76ers in free agency, and Jalen Rose is surprised by the news.
(2:06)All-Star guard James Harden is seriously considering a return to the Houston Rockets in free agency this July -- if he decides against a new deal with the Philadelphia 76ers, sources told ESPN.
Harden signed a two-year, $68.6 million contract with the Sixers, including a player option for 2023-24 that allows him to reenter free agency this summer.
For next summer, the Rockets are flush with salary cap space and an appetite to make significant improvement in the standings.
Harden won three straight scoring titles with the Rockets and ranks second to Hakeem Olajuwon in all-time franchise scoring -- and first in assists.

     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers guard James Harden during a game against the Detroit Pistons at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia on Wednesday, Dec. 21, 2022.
Read moreNEW YORK — Is James Harden seriously considering a return to the Houston Rockets in free agency?
But ESPN reported the former an hour before the Sixers faced the New York Knicks in a Christmas Day game on Sunday at Madison Square Garden.
During the Sixers’ current eight-game winning streak, Harden, 33, is averaging 21.6 points, 12.8 assists, and 1.8 steals (including four steals against the Knicks).
If he opts out this summer, Harden could demand a lot of money from the Sixers if he is indeed considering going back to the Rockets.

     James Harden, Joel Embiid Light Up Twitter on Christmas as 76ers Roll Past Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joel Embiid had 35 points and James Harden added a 29-point, 13-assist double-double as the 76ers came from behind to earn a 119-112 win over the New York Knicks on Christmas Day at Madison Square Garden.
The Sixers have reeled off eight straight wins, tied with the Brooklyn Nets for the longest streak in the NBA.
Sunday's Christmas matinee did not start the way Philly hoped, as the Knicks got off to a red-hot start and led by as many as 14 points in the first half.
His 29 points were his most in more than two months, while his five threes tied a season high.
Dreadful over the first three quarters, the Philadelphia defense finally locked in during the fourth, limiting the Knicks to just 16 points.

And although the Sixers' season got off to a slow start, Embiid and Harden have begun to find a groove together over the past few weeks, helping the 76ers win their eighth straight game.
"The second half was the second half.
But Joel coming out towards the end of the second quarter and being aggressive, I really thought that changed the game.
Also on the injury front, Knicks guard Jalen Brunson left the game in the second half after grabbing at his right hip.

     Summary: HOUSTON, TEXAS - DECEMBER 05: James Harden #1 of the Philadelphia 76ers controls the ball ahead of ... [+] Eric Gordon #10 of the Houston Rockets during the second half at Toyota Center on December 05, 2022 in Houston, Texas.
Ahead of the Sixers' Christmas Day matchup against the New York Knicks, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Harden was "seriously considering a return to the Houston Rockets in free agency" if he decided not to stay with the Sixers.
None of these reports definitively conclude that Harden will leave the Sixers after this season.
If the cap lands at $134 million (the latest projection), a max contract for Harden would begin at $46.9 million.
If they flame out before the conference finals and balk at shelling out nine figures for Harden, though, a Rockets reunion might be in order.

     Summary: Is James Harden plotting his return to the Houston Rockets if he enters free agency in the summer of 2023?
This feels like such a jarring scoop from Woj because Harden forced his way out of Houston less than two years ago.
His stops in Brooklyn and Philadelphia since have failed to yield the deep playoff run he’s been hoping for.
Harden spent the best years of his career with the Houston Rockets, where he powered eight consecutive playoff runs, two trips to the conference finals, and won the 2018 MVP award.
The Nets won only one playoff series in two playoff runs with Harden.

By all accounts, the city of Houston and his foothold in the Rockets organization are something Harden missed the moment he left the franchise.
And after one road visit to San Antonio last season, sources said, Harden took a detour amid the Nets’ road trip to have another evening as a Houston kingmaker.
In December, Harden went out with Lil Baby for the rapper’s birthday following the Sixers’ double-overtime loss at the Rockets.
Story continuesHarden’s apparent interest in rejoining the Rockets resurfaced among league personnel during his contract negotiations with Philadelphia this offseason.

     Summary: In a back-and-forth, star-centric game, the Sixers came away with an eighth consecutive victory by leaning on their big names.
Now 20-12 this season, the Sixers will play Game 2 of their four-game road trip on Tuesday against the Wizards.
Here are observations on their Christmas win:Slow start for Embiid, Sixers’ defenseThe Sixers fell behind early mainly because they let the Knicks be comfortable on offense.
On an after-timeout play, the Sixers tried to find Embiid at the nail off of a pick-and-roll with Shake Milton.
It’s now rare to see any opponent not double team Embiid over and over again, but the Knicks trusted Robinson to hold his own.
