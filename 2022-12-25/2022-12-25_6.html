     The Lakers constantly double-teamed Luka Doncic, and it almost worked ... until he destroyed them
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers visited the Dallas Mavericks on Christmas Day, and it was fascinating to watch how they dealt with Luka Doncic.
In fact, per Kirk Henderson, the MVP candidate was double-teamed on 18 possessions in the first half.
Doncic is the player who sees the most possessions double-teamed per game, via NBA Court Optix.
Dallas knew what to expect from Los Angeles during the second half, the Lakers didn’t make enough changes to their approach.
Doncic eventually figured out exactly how to pick apart the opposing double team, and even though double coverage on Doncic was why the Lakers won the first half, it was also why they struggled in the second.

Jordan Poole: 32 points in 29 minutesPoole entered Christmas averaging 28 points in games Stephen Curry hasn't played, and he continued that trend on Sunday with 32 points in just 29 minutes.
Poole was clearly in cook mode early, jitterbugging all over to create shots and moving without the ball for catch-and-shoots.
Christian Wood: 30 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assistsWood coming off the bench has been a major point of discussion all season.
The seven assists are a career high for Wood, as are the four steals he added to his line.
