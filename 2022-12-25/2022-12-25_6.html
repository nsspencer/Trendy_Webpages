     Luka Doncic drops truth bomb on Mavs’ 51-point third quarter vs. LeBron James, Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa · 2 min readLuka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks made history on Christmas with their 51-point third quarter against the Los Angeles Lakers, and so it led to everyone asking: what just happened with that quarter?
Instead, he emphasized that just boiled down to him and his teammates making the right plays and executing them to perfection.
“I don’t think it was adjustments, I think it was just making the right play,” Doncic said when asked what changed in the third quarter, per Grant Afseth of Dallas Basketball.
As Doncic said, though, their execution was what really propelled them rather than making adjustments.
The Mavs are really a dangerous offensive team when they click, and if they can replicate that third-quarter run and do it more consistently, they’ll be harder to stop.

     Mavs Merry Christmas! Doncic, Wood Lead in Dallas' Win Over LeBron's Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In part of the NBA's Christmas Day action, Luka Doncic's Dallas Mavericks squared off with LeBron James' Los Angeles Lakers.
As we predicted in our game preview on DallasBasketball.com, Christian Wood was due for a breakout game.
Wood finished with 30 points, eight rebounds, seven assists, four steals and two blocks while shooting 12-17 from the field in his first-ever Christmas game.
It was the most points ever scored in a single quarter of an NBA Christmas game.
The Lakers continued to often send doubles at Doncic, but the Mavs were breaking them apart with Wood in the short-roll.

     The Lakers constantly double-teamed Luka Doncic, and it almost worked ... until he destroyed them
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers visited the Dallas Mavericks on Christmas Day, and it was fascinating to watch how they dealt with Luka Doncic.
In fact, per Kirk Henderson, the MVP candidate was double-teamed on 18 possessions in the first half.
Doncic is the player who sees the most possessions double-teamed per game, via NBA Court Optix.
Dallas knew what to expect from Los Angeles during the second half, the Lakers didn’t make enough changes to their approach.
Doncic eventually figured out exactly how to pick apart the opposing double team, and even though double coverage on Doncic was why the Lakers won the first half, it was also why they struggled in the second.
