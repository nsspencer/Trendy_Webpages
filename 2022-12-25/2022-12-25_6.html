     Sixers' James Harden addresses reported interest in Rockets return, enjoys the present
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Still, wearing an exceptionally colorful coat at the podium following the game, Harden was bound to be asked about his future.
ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported around an hour before tip-off that Harden is "seriously considering" a return to the Rockets in free agency if he does not sign a new contract with the Sixers.
“I’m here, we’re playing very well and I don’t know where that report came from," Harden said.
When Harden went down with a right foot tendon strain on Nov. 2, they were 4-5 and desperate for consistency and stability.
Playing the Eastern Conference's best defense in the 14 games Harden missed sure helped on those fronts.

     Sixers’ Christmas Day win showcased the offensive firepower they expected to have all season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harden drew two defenders, and when Jalen Brunson rotated off his man to help Randle, Niang quickly moved the ball to De’Anthony Melton.
Then, after Melton drove and kicked the ball back to Niang, the Sixers’ leading 3-point shooter on the season was wide open.
That is the other confusing end of the spectrum with this Sixers season to date.
Plus, the Sixers subbed Niang in for Tucker in the fourth quarter, something they have done frequently of late.
But on Christmas in New York, the Sixers played as a team and showed offensively how prolific they can be.

     James Harden May Reportedly Consider Rockets Reunion If He Leaves Sixers In Free Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HOUSTON, TEXAS - DECEMBER 05: James Harden #1 of the Philadelphia 76ers controls the ball ahead of ... [+] Eric Gordon #10 of the Houston Rockets during the second half at Toyota Center on December 05, 2022 in Houston, Texas.
Ahead of the Sixers' Christmas Day matchup against the New York Knicks, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Harden was "seriously considering a return to the Houston Rockets in free agency" if he decided not to stay with the Sixers.
None of these reports definitively conclude that Harden will leave the Sixers after this season.
If the cap lands at $134 million (the latest projection), a max contract for Harden would begin at $46.9 million.
If they flame out before the conference finals and balk at shelling out nine figures for Harden, though, a Rockets reunion might be in order.

     Summary: The Sixers acquired Harden from the Brooklyn Nets at the 2022 deadline that sent Ben Simmons and other pieces to the Nets.
In the 2022 free agency, Harden and the Sixers agreed to a 1+1 deal where Harden has a player option in 2023, but per Woj, Harden’s future with the Sixers is up in the air.
After the win over the Knicks on Christmas, Harden addressed the report and he remains committed to Philadelphia.
Harden and the Sixers have now won eight in a row and they will look to keep that going.

But they bounced back from the shocking, ill-timed report and a sluggish start to capture a 119-112 victory.
And they showed the Garden crowd why once Embiid started to get things going in the second quarter.
Embiid scored 11 points in the quarter, mostly by getting to the foul line.
After a Niang basket, Harden scored the Sixers’ final seven points of the quarter.

     Summary: The Philadelphia 76ers found themselves playing on Christmas Day for the first time since 2019 as they paid a visit to the rival New York Knicks up at Madison Square Garden.
The Sixers had won seven games in a row while the Knicks had won eight of their last 10 so the matchup was highly anticipated.
The Knicks got off to a hot start as they built a 14-point lead in the first quarter, but the Sixers kept scrapping and finding a way as they rallied for a 119-112 win on Christmas.
The Knicks led throughout the first three quarters before Philadelphia finally took a lead in the fourth quarter due to the two-man game between James Harden and Georges Niang.
NBA Twitter from fans and analysts alike reacted to the win:
