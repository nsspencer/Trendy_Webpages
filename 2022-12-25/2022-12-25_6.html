    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For three quarters on Sunday, quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and the Miami Dolphins did enough.
And until Tagovailoa and the Dolphins sufficiently address them, they threaten to continue to derail a promising season.
“It’s a challenge, but it’s also something every quarterback really goes through,” McDaniel said.
And while McDaniel emphasized Tagovailoa alone wasn’t at fault for blowing this game, the quarterback’s decision-making undoubtedly contributed.
Dolphins rookie cornerback Kader Kohou instead recorded his first career pick, setting up the Dolphins to pull away from a 20-20 tie.
