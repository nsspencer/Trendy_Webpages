     Memphis Grizzlies silenced by Golden State Warriors without Stephen Curry on Christmas Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO ― The Memphis Grizzlies were served a slice of humble pie for dessert on Christmas Day.
Memphis has been one of the top NBA teams this season, and a matchup against the Golden State Warriors is what the Grizzlies ordered.
For subscribers:The City Council went to lunch with the Memphis Grizzlies.
Ja Morant shines, but doesn't get much helpWhile Brooks and Jackson battled foul trouble, it was Morant who put the Grizzlies on his back.
Morant's scoring kept the Grizzlies in the game, but Memphis didn't get enough help for the majority of the night.

     Trash talk heats up in budding rift as Warriors top Grizzlies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Some good, old-fashioned trash talk," Thompson said.
"It's always fun to talk trash.
Heading into the Warriors' Christmas Day 123-109 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, both sides were hesitant to call the relationship between them a rivalry.
There's been plenty of trash talk between the two teams over the past several months.
And unlike 10 years ago, when Thompson, 32, was early in his career, he said external trash talk doesn't impact him.

     Warriors' latest win over Grizzlies proves it's not true rivalry yet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors know a rival when they see one, and the Memphis Grizzlies, no matter the volume of chatter, do not qualify.
That sent the Grizzlies home for the summer while the Warriors advanced to the Western Conference finals before moving on to the NBA Finals.
How much of a rivalry can it be if one team has a 71.4 percent win rate over the other?
The Grizzlies stayed relatively close until the Warriors went up 10 (43-33) three minutes into the second quarter.
As winners of exactly one postseason series, a first-round win over the Minnesota Timberwolves last April, they are not credentialed.

     Short-handed Warriors remind up-and-coming Grizzlies why they're champions in emotional Christmas Day win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prior to the Grizzlies' marquee Christmas Day matchup against the Warriors, however, the Golden State scouting video was relegated to a laptop with its screen tilted heavily toward the floor.
"[The Golden State scouting video] will go on later," injured Grizzlies veteran Danny Green told CBS Sports in the locker room before the game.
Golden State led by as many as 20 points, and never trailed after the 2:49 mark of the first quarter.
On this night, he was merely a cog in a full team effort from Golden State.
As for the Warriors, games like this Christmas win and a dominant victory over the Celtics a couple weeks ago show that they're still as dangerous as ever in a single-game setting.

     How the Warriors targeted, isolated, and exploited Ja Morant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors had to find another way to challenge the Grizzlies defense instead of directly attacking them head on.
The Warriors targeted Morant in a multitude of ways: both on and off the ball, in the half court and in transition.
But it seems the Grizzlies — and Morant, in particular — were woefully underprepared and caught off guard despite the absence of the Warriors’ offensive centerpiece.
The Warriors used guard-guard screening action — that is, a guard screening for another ball-handling guard — to force Morant into the action.
The Warriors were prepared to send just the right amount of help to stifle Morant, force him to hesitate, and force bad decisions.

     Warriors observations: Jordan Poole keys fiery Christmas Day win vs. Grizzlies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jordan Poole led the way with 32 points, his sixth 30-point game this season.
Poole Sets The ToneWhat months ago was supposed to be Steph Curry vs. Ja Morant quickly became the Jordan Poole vs. Morant show.
Giving Golden State his latest Curry impersonation, Poole scored 17 of his 32 points in the first quarter.
Poole responded with 12 points and the Warriors led by 15 points going in the fourth.
After receiving his second technical foul of the game, Poole was ejected at the 9:20 mark of the fourth quarter.
