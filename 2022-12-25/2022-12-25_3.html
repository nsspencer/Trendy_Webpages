     Sports World Sounds Off on Broncos, Russell Wilson‚Äôs Abysmal Game vs. Rams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christmas Day 2022 will go down as one to forget for Russell Wilson and the Broncos (4‚Äì11) following a downright abysmal showing in a 51‚Äì14 loss to Baker Mayfield and the Rams (5‚Äì10) in Los Angeles.
A pair of Brandon McManus field goals chipped away at the deficit, but the Broncos still trailed big at halftime as the Rams matched their highest output of the season (!)
Wilson‚Äôs woes continued in the second half with a third pick to end a brief five-play drive, which set up another Rams field goal.
Meanwhile, Mayfield, for the first time in a long time, resembled his gunslinging ways with a 24-of-28 day for 230 yards and two scores.
Check out some of the best reactions to Wilson and the Broncos‚Äô terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day below:

     NFL fans absolutely torched Russell Wilson for throwing back-to-back INTs on Broncos‚Äô opening drives
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In perhaps one of the least anticipated Christmas Day games featuring two 4-10 NFL teams, Russell Wilson and the Denver Broncos got off to a rough start against the Los Angeles Rams.
And the Rams made Wilson and co. pay, scoring touchdowns following each pick and grabbing a 17-0 lead before the end of the first quarter.
On 3rd-and-9 on the Broncos‚Äô own 26-yard line, Wilson tried to connect with Courtland Sutton but was instead picked off by Cobie Durant.

But Patrick wasn‚Äôt the only one to torch Wilson for these mistakes.
