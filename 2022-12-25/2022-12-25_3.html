After the Raiders suffered their ninth loss of the season, in crushing fashion, Las Vegas’ running back Josh Jacobs shared his thoughts.
Prior to that last second remaining, with just over two minutes to go, ESPN gave Las Vegas a 71% win probability.

After Las Vegas declined his fifth-year option, Jacobs will be a free agent after the season.
