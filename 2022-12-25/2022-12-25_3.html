     Summary: You can contact Andrew at andrew.amos@dexerto.comThe Epic Games Store crashed across Christmas Day as servers struggled to keep up with demand for Death Stranding.
Epic Games is bringing the festive cheer with its free game promotion across Christmas.
Some have been critical of Epic Games Store in the promotion though.
Originally the platform put the Death Stranding Director‚Äôs Cut for free.
Death Stranding will be available for free until the end of December 25 on the Epic Games Store, with another new game coming on December 26 as the promotion continues.

     Today's Free Game Giveaway Is So Good It's Crashing The Epic Games Store
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As it so happens, today's free game is such a big draw that the Epic Games store had trouble keeping up with demand, at least initially.
Today's title that is up for grabs is Death Stranding.
Once you've claimed the game and completed the checkout process, it's yours to keep in your games catalog forever (or until the Epic Games store ceases to exist, anyway).
Death Stranding released to the PlayStation 4 three years ago, then was ported to PC in July 2020 (see our Death Stranding review ).
Your best bet is to send a daily reminder to check the Epic Games store at 11:00am, so you don't end up forgetting and missing out.
