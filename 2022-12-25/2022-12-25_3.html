     Rams up 10-0 after Russell Wilson interception
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesBroncos quarterback Russell Wilsonâ€˜s return from a concussion is off to a poor start.
Wilsonâ€™s second pass of Sundayâ€™s game against the Rams was picked off by rookie cornerback Cobie Durant in Broncos territory and Los Angeles was able to take advantage.
Baker Mayfield hit tight end Tyler Higbee on back-to-back plays and the second completion went for a nine-yard score.
The Rams also drove for a field goal to open the game, so they now lead 10-0 with just over six minutes to play in the first quarter.
Mayfield is 5-of-5 for 50 yards and Cam Akers has six carries for 40 yards, but a fumbled shotgun snap stopped the momentum on the first possession and forced the team to settle for a 55-yard Matt Gay kick.

     Summary: This is not the Christmas that Broncos fans wanted in Los Angeles.
QB Russell Wilson has thrown not one, but two interceptions.
Even worse, L.A. has turned them both into touchdowns after a couple of short offensive series, and Denver already trails 17-0.

     Summary: Getty ImagesTua Tagovailoa threw three interceptions in the Dolphinsâ€™ loss to the Packers on Sunday afternoon, but Russell Wilson may pass him for the most on Christmas before the first half is over.
He was picked off by cornerback Cobie Durant to set up a Baker Mayfield touchdown pass and his former Seahawks teammate Bobby Wagner got him to end the second possession.
Itâ€™s the first time that Wagner and Wilson have ever faced each other outside of a Seahawks practice.
It took the Rams two plays to get into the end zone.
Running back Cam Akers scored from three yards out and the Rams now lead 17-0 with just under five minutes to play in the first quarter.

The Broncos quarterback turned this one into a pick-fest, throwing three interceptions in his first 17 pass attempts.
Jalen Ramsey came up with the Ramsâ€™ third interception, picking off Wilson in the third quarter on a deep shot for Greg Dulcich.
The tight end snuck behind the defense momentarily, but Ramsey made up plenty of ground and picked off the underthrown pass in the end zone to prevent a potential touchdown.
Cobie Durant and Bobby Wagner had the first two interceptions of the game, which each set up Rams touchdowns.

And the Rams made Wilson and co. pay, scoring touchdowns following each pick and grabbing a 17-0 lead before the end of the first quarter.
On 3rd-and-9 on the Broncosâ€™ own 26-yard line, Wilson tried to connect with Courtland Sutton but was instead picked off by Cobie Durant.

     Summary: Bobby Wagner said back in August that he wanted to sack Russell Wilson on Christmas Day, being former teammates when they were with the Seattle Seahawks.
Wagner is now with the Rams and Russell Wilson is with the Broncos, and while Wagner didnâ€™t get his wish (yet), he did make a different type of game-changing play.
In the first quarter against the Broncos on Sunday, Wagner picked off Wilson on a throw over the middle, returning it inside the 15-yard line to set up a touchdown by Cam Akers a few plays later.
Wagner has been a playmaker all season for the Rams, and this is just another example of him being a stud in Year 1 with Los Angeles.
Itâ€™s icing on the cake that his second interception of the season came against Wilson.
