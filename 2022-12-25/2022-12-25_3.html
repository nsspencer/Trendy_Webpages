     Rams up 10-0 after Russell Wilson interception
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesBroncos quarterback Russell Wilson‘s return from a concussion is off to a poor start.
Wilson’s second pass of Sunday’s game against the Rams was picked off by rookie cornerback Cobie Durant in Broncos territory and Los Angeles was able to take advantage.
Baker Mayfield hit tight end Tyler Higbee on back-to-back plays and the second completion went for a nine-yard score.
The Rams also drove for a field goal to open the game, so they now lead 10-0 with just over six minutes to play in the first quarter.
Mayfield is 5-of-5 for 50 yards and Cam Akers has six carries for 40 yards, but a fumbled shotgun snap stopped the momentum on the first possession and forced the team to settle for a 55-yard Matt Gay kick.

     Summary: Getty ImagesTua Tagovailoa threw three interceptions in the Dolphins’ loss to the Packers on Sunday afternoon, but Russell Wilson may pass him for the most on Christmas before the first half is over.
He was picked off by cornerback Cobie Durant to set up a Baker Mayfield touchdown pass and his former Seahawks teammate Bobby Wagner got him to end the second possession.
It’s the first time that Wagner and Wilson have ever faced each other outside of a Seahawks practice.
It took the Rams two plays to get into the end zone.
Running back Cam Akers scored from three yards out and the Rams now lead 17-0 with just under five minutes to play in the first quarter.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A few weeks ago, legendary former Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner had two sacks and an interception against his old team.
That hurt to watch him do that in a Los Angeles Rams uniform, but at least the Seahawks got the win.
With pivotal draft pick positioning at stake, we are in the rare situation of rooting for the Rams to win.
Russ threw a short pass over the middle that Bobby read all the way, and he picked off Wilson!
It was Wilson’s second interception in as many pass attempts, and both led to Los Angeles touchdowns.

     Summary: Barry WernerTouchdown WireLos Angeles Rams linebacker Bobby Wagner should have a pretty good read on what Russell Wilson plans to do with the football.
The veteran linebacker and quarterback were teammates for years with the Seattle Seahawks.
On Christmas, they were on opposite sides of the field with Wilson under center for the Denver Broncos in a Week 16 clash at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.
Wilson threw a pass and Wagner picked it.
The Rams were out to a quick 17-0 lead after Cam Akers' TD and the PAT.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bobby Wagner said back in August that he wanted to sack Russell Wilson on Christmas Day, being former teammates when they were with the Seattle Seahawks.
Wagner is now with the Rams and Russell Wilson is with the Broncos, and while Wagner didn’t get his wish (yet), he did make a different type of game-changing play.
In the first quarter against the Broncos on Sunday, Wagner picked off Wilson on a throw over the middle, returning it inside the 15-yard line to set up a touchdown by Cam Akers a few plays later.
Wagner has been a playmaker all season for the Rams, and this is just another example of him being a stud in Year 1 with Los Angeles.
It’s icing on the cake that his second interception of the season came against Wilson.

     Summary: Los Angeles Rams linebacker Bobby Wagner picked off his former teammate Russell Wilson SundayThough it is not the intriguing matchup that it was thought to be heading into the season, the Los Angeles Rams and Denver Broncos Sunday game at SoFi Stadium was not without its storylines.
Chief among those headlines was the reunion of former Seahawks Bobby Wagner and Russell Wilson, both of whom departed Seattle for new teams this past offseason.
Wilson of course, headed to the Broncos, while Wagner became the Rams' big-time offseason acquisition.
The interception occurred with the Rams already up two scores, and since, the Los Angeles lead has ballooned to three scores, with Denver down 24-3.
