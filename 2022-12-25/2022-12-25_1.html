     Summary: Los Angeles Chargers All-Pro safety Derwin James was disqualified in the second quarter of Monday night's win over the Indianapolis Colts for a vicious, helmet-to-helmet hit on wide receiver Ashton Dulin.
In the immediate aftermath of the hit, James was flagged, then taken into the blue medical tent before walking to the locker room.
Dulin also went to the locker room, walking under his own power, and was subsequently ruled out with a concussion.
"I thought that he tried to lead with the shoulder," Staley said of James' intent on the play.
The play occurred with 5:19 remaining in the second quarter when Colts quarterback Nick Foles threw an incomplete pass into the flats to Dulin.

     Chargers clinch first playoff berth since 2018 season

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Chargers have officially ended their playoff drought.
With their 20-3 victory over the Indianapolis Colts on Monday night, the Chargers did their part to clinch an AFC wild-card berth following some favorable results in Week 16.
Bound for the playoffs for the first time since 2018, the Chargers (9-6) notched their second three-game win streak of the 2022 season in order to get there.
It will be the Chargers' first postseason appearance under second-year head coach Brandon Staley and with star quarterback Justin Herbert, who was drafted with the No.
The Chargers were a Week 18 win or tie away from making the playoffs in 2021, but lost to the rival Raiders in an overtime thriller.

     Summary: The defense steps up with three interceptions and three fourth-down stops as the Chargers defeat the Colts 20-3.
The Chargers entered Week 16 with a direct path to the postseason after jumping into the No.
I think that we would not be here if it were not for the toughness of our football team, the makeup of our football team," Staley said.
"For far too long people have talked about the talent of this football team and the organization and that's ultimately not what gets you where you want to go.
Despite clinching his first career playoff berth, Herbert appeared adamant that there remains plenty of room for improvement going forward.

     Summary: The Chargers got Derwin James back on Monday night, welcoming their star safety to the secondary after a two-game absence due to injury.
James' return was short-lived, however, after the veteran defensive back was ejected for leading with his helmet on a hard second-quarter hit in Week 16's matchup with the Colts.
James, meanwhile, visited the Chargers' blue medical tent after getting flagged for unnecessary roughness; officials quickly announced he'd also been disqualified for the hit.
The hit, which came two plays after James was penalized for a face mask on Michael Pittman Jr., appeared to affect the Chargers safety even more than Dulin, at least immediately afterward.
James missed the Chargers' previous two games with a quad injury.
