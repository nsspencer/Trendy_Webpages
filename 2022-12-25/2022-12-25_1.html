     Summary: Baker Mayfield connects with Tyler Higbee for the second time to pile on to the Rams' lead in the first half.
"But you guys know I was always a fan of him and I think he's played really well.
On Sunday afternoon, Mayfield led the Rams to a 51-14 victory over the Denver Broncos, a game in which Los Angeles didn't punt.
The Rams' previous season-high scoring total was 31 points, which came in a Week 2 victory over the Atlanta Falcons.
The victory over the Broncos was the Rams' third game scoring at least 50 points since McVay was hired as head coach in 2017.

     Rams embarrass Broncos, 51-14: Instant analysis of Week 16 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Surely, everyone saw this one coming.
Everyone expected the Rams to absolutely steamroll the Broncos and their top-five defense on Christmas Day.
The Rams, who hadn’t scored more than 23 points since Week 6, put up 31 first-half points against the Broncos and cruised to a 51-14 win at SoFi Stadium on Sunday, improving their record to 5-10 despite remaining out of playoff contention.
It was a shocking result for a Rams team that has fielded one of the worst offenses in football all year, and despite the season being all but lost, Los Angeles showed a ton of heart and effort in this win over Denver.
Here’s a quick recap of how the game went and where the Rams go next.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It wasn’t much of a contest at SoFi Stadium on Sunday afternoon, as the Los Angeles Rams blew out the Denver Broncos by a score of 51-14.
It was the Rams’ largest offensive outburst since 2018, jumping out to a 31-6 lead at halftime – also the most points they’ve scored in the first half since 2017.
For a team that scored a total of 52 points in their last three games combined, it was completely out of the blue for the Rams to put up 51 against a stout Broncos defense.
With just two games in the Rams’ season remaining, we take a look at six things we learned from Sunday’s win in Inglewood.

     Mayfield, Akers lead Rams’ 51-14 blowout of Wilson’s Broncos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wagner and his Los Angeles Rams were the only ones who enjoyed the holiday reunion.
Wagner first intercepted a pass by his longtime Seahawks teammate, setting up the Rams’ second touchdown drive in their 31-point first half.
Baker Mayfield threw two touchdown passes to Tyler Higbee, Cam Akers rushed for 118 yards and a career-high three TDs and the Rams routed the Denver Broncos 51-14 for their second victory since mid-October.
For at least one more week, Los Angeles avoided becoming the first defending champion to lose 11 games.
The Rams’ pressure on Wilson improbably was led by Murchison, who signed with Los Angeles 13 days ago after Tennessee cut him.

Rams running back Cam Akers scored three touchdowns to highlight a breakout day from him and the rest of L.A.'s offense.
His two interceptions on his first three pass attempts were each what-were-you-thinking throws that resulted in turnovers deep in Broncos territory.
The Rams scored two touchdowns off takeaways in the first quarter.

    </h2>

     Summary: Christmas Day 2022 will go down as one to forget for Russell Wilson and the Broncos (4–11) following a downright abysmal showing in a 51–14 loss to Baker Mayfield and the Rams (5–10) in Los Angeles.
A pair of Brandon McManus field goals chipped away at the deficit, but the Broncos still trailed big at halftime as the Rams matched their highest output of the season (!)
Wilson’s woes continued in the second half with a third pick to end a brief five-play drive, which set up another Rams field goal.
Meanwhile, Mayfield, for the first time in a long time, resembled his gunslinging ways with a 24-of-28 day for 230 yards and two scores.
Check out some of the best reactions to Wilson and the Broncos’ terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day below:

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos were manhandled in Sunday’s Christmas Day game against the Los Angeles Rams.
Russell Wilson’s return meant very little for the Broncos’ offense which struggled against an Aaron Donald-less Rams defense, while Denver’s defense struggled to stop Baker Mayfield, Tyler Higbee, and the Rams’ offense.
In Sunday’s Christmas showdown with the Rams, Denver’s defense found itself up first against Baker Mayfield and the Rams’ offense.
On their first drive, the Broncos’ defense faced an early uptempo approach by Sean McVay and the Rams’ offense.
On top of that, the Broncos’ defense surrendered 388 yards on the day in their 51-14 loss.
