     Summary: The Mystery Of The Disappearing BeesThe future of our food resources depends on one small insect - the western honey bee, or Apis mellifera.
Indeed, it is the most important agricultural pollinator on our planet, given that one third of our food supply depends directly on pollination from bees.
This documentary tells the story of a worldwide ecological disaster that has been waiting to happen for several generations.

     After blasting U.S. defense aid to Taiwan, China begins military exercises around island it claims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: China launched naval and airpower exercises around Taiwan on Sunday, a day after officials in Beijing blasted the Biden administration for an $858 billion defense bill that authorized additional security assistance for the self-ruling island that China claims.
China blamed increased tensions that triggered the air and naval drills on “escalations of provocations” from the U.S. operating in collusion with Taiwan.
A senior military spokesman said the U.S. doesn’t have the right to insert itself into the question.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022 resulted in protests from China, which quickly ordered military exercises around the island.
“Nothing about the visit changed one iota of the U.S. government’s policy toward Taiwan or China.

     China stages 'strike drills' around Taiwan, citing provocation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/Tyrone SiuBEIJING/TAIPEI, Dec 25 (Reuters) - China's military said it had conducted "strike drills" in the sea and airspace around Taiwan on Sunday in response to what it said was provocation from the democratically-governed island and the United States.
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, said the drills showed Beijing was destroying regional peace and trying to cow Taiwan's people.
"This is a resolute response to the current escalation of collusion and provocation from the United States and Taiwan," it added, without giving details.
Taiwan has complained of repeated Chinese military activity nearby over the last three years or so as Beijing seeks to pressure Taipei to accept Chinese sovereignty.
The United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties.

     PLA holds fire strike drills around Taiwan island after US defense bill provokes China
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Tan said that for a certain period, the US has been constantly hollowing out and distorting the one-China principle, frequently selling arms to the Taiwan island, strengthening its military connection with the island, and concocting Taiwan-related acts that damage China's sovereignty, which seriously jeopardizes peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits and increases the risk of a China-US military confrontation.
"The Chinese People's Liberation Army will, as always, be ready to resolutely safeguard national reunification and the territorial integrity of the country," Tan stressed.You Wenze, a spokesperson of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the NPC, on Saturday also voiced strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the China-related content of the new US defense act.
Any attempts to use the island to contain China or support the separatist forces for "Taiwan independence" will only further escalate tensions across the Taiwan Straits and undermine the political foundation of China-US relations, You said.
"Any provocation that attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's interests will be met with firm countermeasures," You said.The new act stipulates that the US government will provide Taiwan with $10 billion as military aid and $2 billion as military loans within five years, and will accelerate arms sales to the Taiwan island.
""The Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests.

     How Will Japan Prepare for a Taiwan Contingency?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Taiwan Emergency Makes Japan a “Front-Line State”Some in the US government have begun to express concern that Xi Jinping’s timetable for advancing on Taiwan has accelerated.
Xi Jinping may well be thinking, “If not now, when?” The prospect of a Taiwan contingency is becoming increasingly real.
The extent of the damage Japan suffers ultimately depends on how prepared for this contingency Japan is.
Increasing defense spending should also be discussed when taking into account Japan’s wider budget and spending priorities.
