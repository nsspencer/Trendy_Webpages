    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK–The Philadelphia 76ers were struggling on Christmas Day in a matchup with the New York Knicks.
The Sixers looked slow and sluggish as they shot just 42.1% in the first quarter while New York was at 50% and they drilled five triples.
It was a very impressive effort and the Sixers looked a bit dazed and confused to start.
However, after the slow start, Joel Embiid began to get going late in the second quarter and the Sixers closed to within three at the half thanks to a miraculous Shake Milton halfcourt shot.
They then turned it on in the second half and they came away with a 119-112 win for their 8th straight victory.

     Sixers' James Harden addresses reported interest in Rockets return, enjoys the present
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Still, wearing an exceptionally colorful coat at the podium following the game, Harden was bound to be asked about his future.
ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported around an hour before tip-off that Harden is "seriously considering" a return to the Rockets in free agency if he does not sign a new contract with the Sixers.
“I’m here, we’re playing very well and I don’t know where that report came from," Harden said.
When Harden went down with a right foot tendon strain on Nov. 2, they were 4-5 and desperate for consistency and stability.
Playing the Eastern Conference's best defense in the 14 games Harden missed sure helped on those fronts.

     James Harden May Reportedly Consider Rockets Reunion If He Leaves Sixers In Free Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HOUSTON, TEXAS - DECEMBER 05: James Harden #1 of the Philadelphia 76ers controls the ball ahead of ... [+] Eric Gordon #10 of the Houston Rockets during the second half at Toyota Center on December 05, 2022 in Houston, Texas.
Ahead of the Sixers' Christmas Day matchup against the New York Knicks, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Harden was "seriously considering a return to the Houston Rockets in free agency" if he decided not to stay with the Sixers.
None of these reports definitively conclude that Harden will leave the Sixers after this season.
If the cap lands at $134 million (the latest projection), a max contract for Harden would begin at $46.9 million.
If they flame out before the conference finals and balk at shelling out nine figures for Harden, though, a Rockets reunion might be in order.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harden drew two defenders, and when Jalen Brunson rotated off his man to help Randle, Niang quickly moved the ball to De’Anthony Melton.
Then, after Melton drove and kicked the ball back to Niang, the Sixers’ leading 3-point shooter on the season was wide open.
That is the other confusing end of the spectrum with this Sixers season to date.
Plus, the Sixers subbed Niang in for Tucker in the fourth quarter, something they have done frequently of late.
But on Christmas in New York, the Sixers played as a team and showed offensively how prolific they can be.

     Woj: Sixers star James Harden seriously considering return to Rockets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Philadelphia 76ers get set for a Christmas Day matchup with the New York Knicks, some news broke from ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski that James Harden is now seriously considering a return to his old stomping grounds with the Houston Rockets.
ESPN’s Tim MacMahon previously began connecting the dots on Harden going back to Houston, but now Wojnarowski is reporting that this is a serious thought for The Beard in free agency of 2023.
The Sixers gave up significant assets to acquire Harden, and he’s expected to remain a priority to re-sign on a new deal for a second consecutive summer.
The Sixers went big for Harden at the deadline in 2022 as they sent Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond, and a slew of picks to the Brooklyn Nets for the future Hall of Fame guard.
If Harden were to leave and go back to the Rockets in the summer of 2023, it would be disappointing for this front office to really strike out on such a big deal.

On an after-timeout play, the Sixers tried to find Embiid at the nail off of a pick-and-roll with Shake Milton.
It’s now rare to see any opponent not double team Embiid over and over again, but the Knicks trusted Robinson to hold his own.

Later told why the question had to be asked, Harden responded: "I'm not talking right now before the game."
