     NBA: Lakers looking to cool off Luka Doncic, Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Coming off a 50-point performance on Friday, Luka Doncic leads the Dallas Mavericks into a Christmas Day showcase on Sunday against the visiting Los Angeles Lakers.
His was the ninth 50-plus-point game of this NBA season, putting Doncic in a club that includes Lakers big man Anthony Davis.
Davis has not appeared since playing just 17:27 in and missing the second half of the Lakers‚Äô Dec. 16 win over Western Conference-leading Denver, however.
Without Davis ‚Äî who is averaging team-highs of 27.4 points, 12.1 rebounds and 2.1 blocked shots per game ‚Äî Thomas Bryant moved into the Lakers‚Äô starting rotation.
This is Los Angeles‚Äô fourth skid of at least three games this season as the Lakers slipped six games below .500.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just assume that ‚Ä¶ [because] we have first-ballot Hall of Famers on this roster that we can just play around with the game and waste possessions and someone‚Äôs going to put their cape on and come save the day,‚Äù Ham said .
