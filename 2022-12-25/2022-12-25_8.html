     Summary: Bajcetic became the second youngest Spanish scorer in the Premier League after Cesc Fabregas for Arsenal in 2004.
The Scottish defender's pass for Salah's opener took him past Leighton Baines with the most assists of any defender in Premier League history, 54.
But when you do stuff like that and you're in the Premier League against some unbelievable defenders, it's always nice to put yourself at the top," Robertson said.
Liverpool are on 25 points, one behind old rivals Manchester United in fifth but a daunting 12 behind Premier League leaders Arsenal, who were playing later on Monday.
Villa were left to rue missed chances, including two scuffed shots from Leon Bailey and a fluffed close-range header from Watkins prior to his goal.

     Summary: BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) — Liverpool extended its winning streak in the Premier League by beating Aston Villa 3-1 on Monday to close the gap on the top four.
Liverpool’s third straight victory moved the club five points adrift of the Champions League spots, with Juergen Klopp’s side remaining sixth.
Liverpool rode its luck against midtable Villa, which put up a fight but missed chances and lacked the quality when it mattered most.
Liverpool’s Darwin Nunez dummied Andy Robertson’s cross, leading to Villa ‘keeper Robin Olsen and Tyrone Mings colliding and the defender needing treatment.
Liverpool took the sting out of Villa and eventually ended its hopes with nine minutes left when Bajcetic showed impressive composure in his first senior goal for Liverpool.

A spare part for Gareth Southgate at the World Cup, the Liverpool right-back’s importance to Jurgen Klopp remains vast.
Like Liverpool, Alexander-Arnold faded after the interval.

     Liverpool's signing of Cody Gakpo piles the pressure on Nunez
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gakpo will be the third significant attacking signing in 12 months by Liverpool, with Diaz arriving from Porto last January and Nunez completing a club record transfer worth up to £85m in June.
Darwin Nunez will get extra competition for his place following the arrival of Cody Gakpo.
The answer, or much of it at least, is about Nunez and his hit-and-miss start to life at Liverpool.
Mohamed Farag/Getty ImagesNunez has Expected Goals (xG) of 5.9 in the Premier League this season, which places him in eighth position overall, between Newcastle's Callum Wilson and Leeds United's Rodrigo.
One such pass led to Salah scoring in the 3-2 defeat at the Etihad, but there were other instances at Villa when shooting at goal would have been the better course of action.

     Cody Gakpo: Liverpool match Dutch star’s electric pace to steal another signing from rivals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The problem, for Southampton and Leeds United, was that the window when they might have signed Cody Gakpo was just that: one transfer window.
Not for the first time, given United’s past interest in Darwin Nunez, Liverpool showed stealth and speed to take a player rivals wanted.
Diaz’s latest injury, initially a curse, could seem a blessing if it made Liverpool accelerate their interest in Gakpo.
But, within 2022, they have now refitted a forward line for the 2020s, signing Diaz, Nunez and soon Gakpo, committing Salah and Diogo Jota to long-term deals.
In the short term, Liverpool may hope he provides impetus, much as Diaz did with his mid-winter arrival last year.
