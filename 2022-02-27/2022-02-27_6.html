     North Korea Says It Held Test For ‘Reconnaissance Satellite’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     North Korea said it held an “important” test for a reconnaissance satellite over the weekend, in its first launch of a ballistic missile since late January.
Its official Korean Central News Agency said Monday the launch that took place a day earlier helped confirm the characteristics and working accuracy of a high definition photographing system, data transmission system and attitude control devices.
North Korea’s space program is seen as having a dual-use application for bolstering its ballistic missiles for the military.

     North Korea's new suspected ballistic missile launch is an 'unforgivable' act if it is taking advantage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, says Japan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Military officials have said North Korea fired a suspected ballistic missile today.
The United States condemned the latest launch, and called on North Korea to "refrain from further destabilizing acts."
It said that North Korea was threatening the security of Japan and the international community, Reuters reported.
"If North Korea deliberately carried out the missile launch while the international community is distracted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, such an act is absolutely unforgivable," he told reporters, according to AP.
"Whatever the motives are, North Korea's repeated missile launches are absolutely inexcusable, and we cannot overlook considerable missile and nuclear advancement," Kishi said.

     North Korea fires ballistic missile in resumption of testing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea launched a ballistic missile into the sea on Sunday, its neighbors said, in a resumption of weapons tests that came as the United States and its allies are focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
North Korea also might view the U.S. preoccupation with the Ukraine conflict as a chance to accelerate testing activity without any serious response from Washington.
The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command later Sunday condemned the launch and called on North Korea to refrain from further destabilizing acts.
This photo provided by the North Korean government shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks in a ruling party meeting in Pyongyang, North Korea on Feb. 26, 2022.
North Korea halted testing activity after the start of the Winter Olympics in China, its last major ally and economic pipeline, earlier this month.

     Attention-Hungry Kim Jong Un Makes Putin’s Bloodbath All About Him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SEOUL—Vladimir Putin has a soulmate in Pyongyang in the form of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
North Korea is estimated now to have about 60 nukes at its nuclear complex at Yongbyon, about 60 miles north of Pyongyang.
North Korea last tested an ICBM in November 2017 and is believed to be preparing to test another ICBM.
Resumption of North Korean missile testing is deeply worrisome to the government of President Moon Jae-in, who has failed in attempts at reconciliation and dialogue with North Korea.
The North Korean missile test, along with the commentary, also appeared as a warning to South Korean voters of the dangers of pursuing a hard line.

     North Korea Fires up 8th Weapons Test of the Year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     North Korea fired what looks to be a ballistic missile early Sunday, marking a return to weapons testing after a near monthlong pause overlapping the Beijing Winter Olympics.
North Korea’s last test, conducted January 30, involved a Hwasong-12 intermediate range missile — Pyongyang’s longest-range missile test in more than four years.
Ballistic missile activity by North Korea is banned under a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions.
North Korea on its own timelineSome analysts have warned North Korea may soon resume larger weapons testing while the world’s attention is focused on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Motivating North Korea is its ultimate goal to be recognized as a nuclear-armed state by the United States and the world, said Park Won-gon, associate professor of North Korean studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The launch was the eighth test this year, and the first since January when nuclear-armed North Korea fired off a record number of missiles.
"The test is of great significance in developing the reconnaissance satellite," the report said.
Developing a military reconnaissance satellite is among a number of advancements leader Kim Jong Un called for last year, including recently tested hypersonic weapons.
"It does, however, remind us that Kim Jong Un committed to launching a military reconnaissance satellite at the last meeting of the Worker's Party Congress," Lewis said.
North Korea has previously successfully placed at least two satellites in orbit, the last one in 2016.
