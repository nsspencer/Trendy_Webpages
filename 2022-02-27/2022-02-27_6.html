     MANHATTAN, N.Y.–The Philadelphia 76ers entered Madison Square Garden on Sunday afternoon with confidence considering they now possess a deadly two-man star tandem.
As they got set to take on the struggling New York Knicks, they saw a new opportunity to grow the pairing on the floor.
Philadelphia was able to continue to grow the duo as New York truly had no answer for them at all.
Tobias Harris struggled with 12 points on 3-for-9 shooting., but he did make some big plays in the fourth quarter.

     Read moreNEW YORK — Has James Harden gotten a bum rap?
Even though the point guard is averaging a league second-best 10.3 assists, he came to the 76ers with the reputation of being a ball hog.
Harden had 29 points, a season-high-tying 16 assists and a season-high five steals in Sunday’s 125-109 victory over the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
After he scored the Sixers’ first basket, Harden assisted on the next three on Sunday.

     Here are three early impressions of the new-look Sixers.
Three-headed monsterWhen the Harden trade became official, the first thing everyone brought up was the Sixers’ new superstar offensive duo.
Despite the minimal preparation time, the two have seamlessly found a way to co-exist at a high level early on.
While many focus on the play of the two All-Stars, the Sixers offense has quietly turned into a three-headed monster.
One way Harden has made things much simpler for his new teammates is with his passing.

     James Harden scores first triple-double with Philly as 76ers beat Knicks at MSG
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Associated PressNEW YORK – Joel Embiid and James Harden were greeted by loud roars from the plenty of Philadelphia fans that packed Madison Square Garden.
Embiid finished 23 of 27 on free throws and the NBA’s leading scorer added nine rebounds.
Embiid made six free throws, Harden four, and the only 76ers basket during that stretch came when Harden fed Embiid on the fast break.
Once Embiid fouled out both opposing centers and the Knicks were forced to play small, the 76ers put Harden and Embiid in the pick-and-roll.
“They shot 40-whatever it was, a ton of free throws, and we shot a lot,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said.
