     Now that they no longer having to work on Sunday, Matthew Stafford and Andrew Whitworth found a fun way to conclude the weekend.
The honorary guests arrived in Fontana, California, to give the command for Sunday’s NASCAR Cup Series race.
Since the left tackle and quarterback developed a tight rapport over the season, Whitworth and Stafford didn’t seem too worried about telling racers to start their engines.
LA Rams tackle Andrew Whitworth brought some help to give the command today … his quarterback Matthew Stafford.
LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford and tackle Andrew Whitworth talk about becoming NASCAR fans later in life after attending races at Talladega.
