     While Europe has pledged to aid those fleeing Russia’s invasion the mass exodus of Ukrainians may overwhelm resources in neighboring countries, The Hill reports.
As many as 5 million Ukrainians could be displaced by Russian forces, according to U.S. intelligence agencies.
President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian nuclear forces put on high alert Sunday in response to what he called “aggressive statements” by leading NATO powers.
The images underscored the determined resistance Russian troops face while attempting to enter Ukraine’s bigger cities.
Ukrainians have volunteered en masse to help defend the capital, Kyiv, and other cities, taking guns distributed by authorities and preparing firebombs to fight Russian forces.
