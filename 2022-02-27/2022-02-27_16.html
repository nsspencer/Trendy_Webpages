     Joe Rogan shares fake news report about Steven Seagal joining Russian special forces
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Joe Rogan has been mocked for sharing a fake CNN report claiming that Steven Seagal has joined Russian special forces stationed near Kyiv.
On Monday (28 February), the 54-year-old podcaster posted a forged screenshot of a news report that depicts Seagal wearing the special force’s uniform with a gun in his hand.
“Intelligence agencies around the world have spotted American actor Steven Seagal among Russian special forces positioned around the outskirts of Gostomel airfield near Kyiv captured by Russian airborne troops,” the fake news report states.
This world is bonkers.”“I am so ashamed of you Joe Rogan,” wrote an angry fan.
It’s not.”Another person wrote: “Joe Rogan sharing misinformation while taking 70 episodes of his own show down.”The Independent has contacted Rogan’s representative for comment.
