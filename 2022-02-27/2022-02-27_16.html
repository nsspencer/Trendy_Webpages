     This afternoon, Ohio State became the latest ranked team to fall on what was a wild weekend of upsets around college basketball.
In front of the program’s 2021-22 national championship team, the Terrapins knocked off OSU, 75-60.
Maryland guards Fatts Russell and Eric Ayala went off for 27 and 23 points respectively, combining to hit 8-of-15 three-pointers.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Ohio State basketball team was still fighting for a Big Ten Championship heading into their matchup against Maryland.
Those dreams are certainly over after the Buckeyes suffered their worst loss of the season against a bad Maryland team.
The two best players for Ohio State were awful.
Ohio State also allowed 11 offensive rebounds in this game.
Unless something changes soon, it’s time to start having a conversation about Holtmann’s future as the head coach of this Ohio State basketball program.

     Ohio State's Taylor Mikesell defends vs. Michigan StateThe Ohio State women’s basketball team was likely somewhere between East Lansing and Columbus when it became official – the Buckeyes had won a share of the 2022 Big Ten regular season championship.
The Buckeyes improved to 22-5 overall and 14-4 in Big Ten play with their 61-55 win at Michigan State on Sunday.
That result put Iowa in a tie with Ohio State for the conference championship at 14-4.
The championship game will be at 4 p.m. Sunday on ESPN2.
The win over Michigan State gave Ohio State victories in seven of its last eight games to wrap the regular season.

     There sure have been some “what-ifs” and “if-only” things to reflect upon that would have OSU already in first place this season, but that’s every team in the ultra-competitive Big Ten.
Now it’s time for the next step for Ohio State that’s still a game or two behind because of some scheduling quirks this season.
The Buckeyes will have to battle fatigue and quick-gameplan installations as they play four games in a week, but at least there’s still a prize potentially out there.
Will the Terps kill OSU’s dreams of a regular-season crown, or can Ohio State do its part to make a mess of the top of the league?
Here’s what you need to know for the game and how we see it all playing out.

     The Ohio State Buckeyes entered the 2021-22 regular season with some question marks.
They lost two starting forwards to the transfer portal and their starting point guard to a season-ending injury.
Ohio State needed some help from their co-champions to do it.
Before the 2021-22 season even began, it was a roller coaster for Ohio State.
For the negatives in the front court, Ohio State strengthened their back court.
