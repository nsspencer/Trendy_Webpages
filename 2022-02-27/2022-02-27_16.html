     North Korea Test Fires Rocket for ‘Satellite’ as Ukraine Heats Up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     North Korea said it conducted an “important” test for a reconnaissance satellite over the weekend, launching its first rocket with ballistic missile capability in a month as global attention is focused on Ukraine.
Its official Korean Central News Agency said Monday the launch that took place a day earlier helped test high-definition photography and data-transmission systems and attitude control devices.
State media released photos showing the Korean Peninsula from space it said were taken from the satellite.

     North Korea says latest missile test part of building satellite surveillance system
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     North Korea says a test conducted on Sunday was for the development of a reconnaissance satellite system, state media reported a day after a missile launch was detected from the country.
The launch was the eighth test this year, and the first since January when nuclear-armed North Korea fired off a record number of missiles.
The last missile test, on 30 January, featured a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile with a camera fitted in its nose cone.
Previous launches of what it says are space rockets have been criticised by the US and its allies as thinly veiled tests of ballistic missile technology.
North Korea has previously successfully placed at least two satellites in orbit, the last one in 2016.

     North Korea says latest test was for ‘reconnaissance satellite’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said a test conducted on Sunday was for the development of a reconnaissance satellite system, state news agency KCNA reported on Monday, a day after a missile launch was detected from the country.
The launch was the eighth test this year and the first since January, when nuclear-armed North Korea fired off a record number of missiles.
“The test is of great significance in developing the reconnaissance satellite,” the report said.
Developing a military reconnaissance satellite is among a number of advancements leader Kim Jong Un called for last year, including recently tested hypersonic weapons.
North Korea has previously successfully placed at least two satellites in orbit, the last one in 2016.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     North Korea didn’t directly acknowledge any missile launch, but the KCNA statement suggests North Korea fired a rocket or a missile to take space-based photos.
But Lee said he couldn’t verify the quality of the North Korean cameras because it didn’t release higher-resolution satellite images.
After repeated failures, North Korea successfully put its first satellite into orbit in 2012 and second one in 2016.
He said tensions would still deepen as the United States would strengthen military drills with South Korea, which North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal, in response.
He underscored the U.S. readiness to engage in serious diplomacy with North Korea while reaffirming “ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of” South Korea and Japan, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.
