     Reports: Ukrainian navy says Snake Island soldiers ‘alive and well’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (Gray News) - The Ukrainian navy says the soldiers of Snake Island who defied orders from an invading Russian vessel to lay down their arms are “alive and well,” according to CNN.
“I am a Russian military ship proposing to put down (your) arms immediately to avoid bloodshed and unjustified deaths,” begins the recording.
“In worst case, you will be hit with a bomb strike.”The Ukrainian navy released a statement saying the soldiers fought off two attacks from the Russians before being forced to surrender.
The soldiers were reportedly shown on Russian state media arriving where they are currently being held in Sevastopol, Crimea.

     Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island who told off Russian warship may be alive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A group of Ukrainian soldiers who garnered worldwide attention after forcefully telling off a Russian warship may be alive, contrary to earlier reports, according to Ukrainian officials.
The soldiers on Snake Island, a small island in the Black Sea, rose to fame last week after a Russian warship asked them to surrender or be bombed, according to a tweet from the Ukrainian Embassy in Georgia.
In audio of the incident, a Russian officer can be heard telling the soldiers to lay down arms to "avoid bloodshed and unjustified deaths" before one of the Ukrainian soldiers responded with an expletive.
The statement added that Russian media reports say the captured soldiers were sent to Sevastopol, a city in Crimea.
Ukrainian and Russian delegations were meeting at the Belarusian border on Monday for the first direct talks since Russia invaded Ukraine last week.

     Ukrainian Military Says Soldiers at Snake Island Survived
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Ukrainian military is reporting that the soldiers who famously told Russian invaders to “Go fuck yourselves” are still alive and being held captive, despite initial reports saying they had been killed.
In an audio recording widely shared online, a Russian ship could be heard addressing the crew of 13 guarding Snake Island, off Ukraine’s southwest coast.
The Russian ship instructed the crew to lay down their weapons or “be bombed.”“Go fuck yourselves,” the Ukrainians said in response.
However, the Ukrainian Navy announced in a Feb. 28, 2022, Facebook post that the 13 soldiers were not dead; they were in fact alive and well and being held captive.
The Ukrainian Navy said it had at first believed that the soldiers were dead because Russian bombardment destroyed the island’s infrastructure, and thus they were unable to communicate with the crew.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 13 Ukrainian border guards-turned-international-heroes that had reportedly been killed after telling a Russian warship to “go fuck yourself” instead of surrendering their post were confirmed to be alive on Sunday by the Ukrainian Navy .
“This is a Russian warship,” the invaders announced.
And while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself had confirmed late Thursday that the guards had “died heroically” defending the island, the guards are alive and have been taken prisoner by Russian forces.
Zelenskyy has yet to comment on this new revelation regarding the Snake Island border guards.

     The defiant soldiers of Snake Island are actually 'alive and well,' says Ukraine's navy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) The Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island -- who were all feared dead after their defiant response to threats from a Russian warship -- are actually "alive and well," according to the Ukrainian Navy.
All of the soldiers on the tiny island in the Black Sea were thought to have been killed in an attack on the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last Thursday.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said later on Thursday that 13 soldiers on Snake Island all died "heroically" by Russian bombardment.
But -- after the Ukrainian border guard said that it had information disputing the deaths -- a statement on Monday from the country's navy suggested this was certainly not the case.
According to the navy the soldiers on the island repelled two attacks by Russian forces but in the end were forced to surrender "due to the lack of ammunition."

Ukrainian soldiers were occupying the island, which is located about 20 miles off shore, when a Russian ship approached and a Russian officer offered a stern warning, according to unverified audio.
In the audio clip of what purportedly took place next, a voice could be heard telling the Ukrainian soldiers: "This is a Russian military warship.
There was a brief exchange before one Ukrainian soldier allegedly said in response: "Russian warship, go f--- yourself."
The Ukrainian Navy added that Russian soldiers "completely destroyed the island's infrastructure: lighthouses, towers, antennas, etc."
