     There are even more Pokémon games on the way.
At a livestreamed event on Sunday morning, The Pokémon Company teased two new titles: Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
As one of the main characters, trainers will jump into the world of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet to begin their adventure, where they will have a different outfit depending on which game they are playing.
Trainers will then choose either Sprigatito, the grass cat pokémon, Fuecoco, the fire croc pokémon, or Quaxly, the duckling pokémon to be their first partner pokémon before setting off on their journey.
And the competitive battle game Pokémon Unite will also be getting some notable new features, including new, more intense fights called “fury battles” that launch today.

     The Pokemon CompanyThe ninth generation of Pokemon games were revealed in a Pokemon Presents livestream Sunday.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet hit Nintendo Switch in late 2022, the Pokemon Company said, and are set in a new region that looks to have been inspired by lovely Mediterranean Europe.
The Game Freak-developed Scarlet and Violet will be even more open-world than the recent Pokemon Legends: Arceus, with towns blending seamlessly into the wilderness with no borders.
They'll add Pokemon Home compatibility "after their release," so you'll be able to bring Pokemon you caught in previous games into the new region.
If you're still working on your Pokedex in Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, you'll be able to claim mythical Pokemon Shaymin from Sunday.

     Pokémon Scarlet And Violet Announced, Here Are The New Starters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the next two games in the mainline Pokémon series, are coming to Nintendo Switch later this year, The Pokémon Company announced during today’s Pokémon Presents.
Instead, something something that kind of looked like a hybrid of this year’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus and 2020's Pokémon Sword and Shield started playing.
Here’s how the Scarlet and Violet website describes the game:Various towns blend seamlessly into the wilderness with no borders.
You’ll be able to experience the true joy of the Pokémon series—battling against wild Pokémon in order to catch them—now in an open-world game that players of any age can enjoy.​Who are Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s starters?
Players will effectively have gotten the Pokémon BDSP remakes, the series first open world spin-off, and an entirely new set of mainline Pokémon games in the span of a single year.

     Pokémon Scarlet And Violet Announced, Shows Off Gen 9 Starters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Game Freak has now announced the arrival of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the next mainline games in the series, Gen 9.
And it’s coming sooner than you might imagine, just a year after Pokémon Arceus Legends, in late 2022.
Scarlet and Violet very much resemble the look of Legends and it seems like an open-ish world may be on the table.
I imagine that many concepts of Arceus may be implemented in Scarlet and Violet, but we’ll have to wait and see.
We’ll see when Game Freak wants to talk more about Scarlet and Violet, so instead, just print out those starters and stare at them on your wall for a while.
