     5 Key Takeaways From the 2022 SAG Awards
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Sunday night, the glitterati gathered in Santa Monica (after extensive COVID-19 testing and safety protocols, many of them were quick to assure us) to ring in the 28th Annual SAG Awards.
Overall, the night was...well, I don’t want to say “meh,” but there weren’t a ton of moments of, say, Brad-and-Jen-holding-hands caliber.
Still, it was heartening to see all those famous faces gathered together again, and there were definitely a few things worth talking about.
Below, find a guide to the key takeaways from this year’s SAG Awards.

     SAG Awards 2022: ‘CODA,’ Will Smith and Jessica Chastain Take Top Prizes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Smith, considered the Oscar front-runner, began tearing up when the show ran a clip from “King Richard,” in which he plays the father of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams.
Though the SAG Awards are considered among the more important Oscar precursors, recent winners have sometimes diverged from precedent.
Both of the lead actors who took SAG Awards last year — Chadwick Boseman and Viola Davis from “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” — lost the Oscar.
In the supporting categories, the overlap was much slimmer, and only two of the five SAG nominees also received Oscar nominations.

     ‘West Side Story’ star Ariana DeBose makes LGBTQ+ history at 2022 SAG Awards
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “West Side Story” breakout Ariana DeBose is the first openly queer woman to win an individual film prize at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.
The rising movie star received the film honor for supporting actress for her powerful turn as Anita in Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story.” She prevailed over fellow nominees Caitríona Balfe (“Belfast”), Cate Blanchett (“Nightmare Alley”), Kirsten Dunst (“The Power of the Dog”) and Ruth Negga (“Passing”).
Earlier this month, DeBose also landed her first Oscar nomination for her emotional performance as Anita, and became the first openly queer woman of color nominated for an acting Oscar.
AdvertisementDeBose and “Spencer” star Kristen Stewart also became the first openly queer performers nominated for an Oscar since Ian McKellen in 2002 for “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.” Though he did not win the Oscar, McKellen did win the supporting actor SAG Award that year, making him the only other out actor to win an individual film prize from the actors guild.
And we queer,” DeBose said to Entertainment Tonight at the SAG Awards red carpet.
