     SAG Awards 2022: ‘CODA,’ Will Smith and Jessica Chastain Take Top Prizes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Smith, considered the Oscar front-runner, began tearing up when the show ran a clip from “King Richard,” in which he plays the father of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams.
Though the SAG Awards are considered among the more important Oscar precursors, recent winners have sometimes diverged from precedent.
Both of the lead actors who took SAG Awards last year — Chadwick Boseman and Viola Davis from “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” — lost the Oscar.
In the supporting categories, the overlap was much slimmer, and only two of the five SAG nominees also received Oscar nominations.
“We, deaf actors, have come a long way.”Here is a complete list of winners:MoviesOutstanding Cast“CODA”Actor in a Leading RoleWill Smith, “King Richard”Actress in a Leading RoleJessica Chastain, “The Eyes of Tammy Faye”
