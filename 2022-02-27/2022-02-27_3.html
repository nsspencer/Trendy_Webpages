     SAG Awards 2022: ‘CODA,’ Will Smith and Jessica Chastain Take Top Prizes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Smith, considered the Oscar front-runner, began tearing up when the show ran a clip from “King Richard,” in which he plays the father of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams.
Though the SAG Awards are considered among the more important Oscar precursors, recent winners have sometimes diverged from precedent.
Both of the lead actors who took SAG Awards last year — Chadwick Boseman and Viola Davis from “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” — lost the Oscar.
In the supporting categories, the overlap was much slimmer, and only two of the five SAG nominees also received Oscar nominations.

     ‘CODA’ takes top prize at SAG Awards in a major win for Deaf representation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In a major triumph for Deaf representation in Hollywood, the ensemble of “CODA” clinched the top prize Sunday at the 2022 Screen Actors Guild Awards.
After receiving two SAG nominations, the heartwarming Apple TV+ dramedy about a child of Deaf adults (CODA) won them both, including the coveted award for performance by a cast in a motion picture.
Unlike any previous SAG Award film ensemble winner, “CODA” centers on multiple Deaf characters portrayed by Deaf actors.
Matlin led the film’s ensemble in the acceptance speech and notes: “This validates the fact that we, Deaf actors, can work just like anybody else.
We look forward to more opportunities for Deaf actors, Deaf culture.”
