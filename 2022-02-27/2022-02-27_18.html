Now it’s time for the next step for Ohio State that’s still a game or two behind because of some scheduling quirks this season.
The Buckeyes will have to battle fatigue and quick-gameplan installations as they play four games in a week, but at least there’s still a prize potentially out there.

Ohio State shot just 36.2 percent from the field for the game, and Maryland scored 18 points off of the Buckeyes' 11 turnovers.
Ohio State had four players hit double-digit scoring figures, with Branham and Cedric Russell leading the way with 13 and 12, respectively.

The first-year wing seems to be getting hotter by the minute for Ohio State, which isn’t shying away from leaning on its emerging star.
Given the hot streak that Branham has been on, coupled with a healthy Liddell, Ohio State should roll once again, even in the Terps’ backyard.

In all, Ohio State shot 52% from the field and 50% from three-point range — another major area of improvement.
Ohio State, meanwhile, is certainly not out of contention for a regular season conference title, though they’d need help to get there.
While Ohio State rattled off two straight wins, at some point, fatigue does become an issue.
