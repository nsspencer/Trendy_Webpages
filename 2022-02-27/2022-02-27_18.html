     Like Lowry, Straka started the day five shots in arrears of Berger but made up that ground and more with a six-birdie, two-bogey 66.
His first four birdies all came inside 12 feet, but it was a birdie from just off the green from 18 feet at the par-4 16th that put Straka in a share of the lead before one final two-putt birdie at the last proved to be the difference.
