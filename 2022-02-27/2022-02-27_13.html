     – The poem Tommy recites in his meeting with Michael’s men is William Blake’s ‘A Poison Tree‘.
Writer Steven Knight told Den of Geek “I just wanted something that expressed the vengeance, if you like, with Michael, or the lack of vengeance, and that poem just sprang out.

He’s cited in The Dublin Review as “a famous friend of Irish nationalism” and later settled in County Galway.

     It has been almost three years since we were last invited into the fold of Tommy Shelby’s gang of Peaky Blinders.

This was the Peaky Blinders we have fallen in love with over the past nine years – a dark, gloomy, tense, intricately planned (but never too complicated) show, full of exceptional performances and the underhand machinations of a loveable rogue gangster.
Peaky Blinders continues on Sunday 6 March at 9pm on BBC One
