     Stock Futures Fall and Oil Leaps as Ukraine Crisis Deepens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stock futures fell, oil prices jumped and Russian authorities scrambled to keep a grip on domestic markets, as investors rushed to adjust to geopolitical developments including new sanctions against Russia.
The Russian ruble plunged to a record low, trading as much as 112 rubles to $1 in the European morning.
Russia’s attack on Ukraine helped push the price of oil to over $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014.
Prices fell late in the week after initial sanctions on Russia stopped short of what many traders considered the most severe measures that would slash supply.
The S&amp;P 500 last week fell into a correction when it closed down more than 10% from its January record.
