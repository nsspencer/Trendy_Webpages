    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PRISTINA, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Kosovo has asked the United States to establish a permanent military base in the country and speed up its integration into NATO after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Kosovo's Defence Minister Armend Mehaj said on Sunday.
The United States has already 635 soldiers in the Balkan country to maintain the fragile peace as part of a NATO peacekeeping mission.

     Serbia lashes out at Kosovo over police logistical efforts in north
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Serbia’s Office for Kosovo has lashed out at Kosovo for “destabilising the region” after Kosovo police announced they would be increasing their logistic capacities in the border village of Bërnjak.
The press release also describes the operation as part of the Kosovo Police’s efforts to improve work conditions for police officers.
The announcement drew the attention of the Office for Kosovo of the Serbian government, which described it as a “dangerous provocation” that seeks to “destabilise the region”.
Earlier this week, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić said the crisis may spread to the Balkans, while Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani raised concerns that Russia will use Serbia to destabilise the region.
Last year, Kosovo’s two border checkpoints with Serbia at Bërnjak and Jarina were the subjects of blockades by Kosovo Serbs after Kosovo imposed reciprocal measures on cars with Serbian licence plates.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Pristina says it is an ‘immediate need’ of US military base to maintain peace in the BalkansKosovo has announced it would ask Washington to set up a permanent military base on its territory, urging the US and its allies to accept Pristina’s bid to join NATO.
Currently, four members of the US-led military block still refuse to recognize Kosovo as an independent state.
A little over 50 percent of UN member states have recognized Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 with the support from the West.
The campaign condemned “Operation Allied Force”, however, has led to heavy civilian casualties and a displacement of an estimated 200,000 ethnic Serbs from Kosovo.
Dozens of schools and over 20 hospitals were destroyed amid the “humanitarian intervention,” and about 40,000 homes were damaged.
