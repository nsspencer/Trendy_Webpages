     Michael Keaton dedicates 'Dopesick' SAG Award to nephew who died from addiction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Actor Michael Keaton was late to the stage when accepting his Screen Actor's Guild Award, but once he was there, he made his time count.
Keaton, who won the award for his role in "Dopesick," Hulu's compelling recounting of the rise of opioid addiction in America, gave an impassioned speech in which he expressed his appreciation for the craft of acting and the ability to tell stories that can "improve someone's life."
"I'm the most fortunate person," said Keaton, who was late to the stage after taking an ill-timed bathroom break.
Through tears, Keaton dedicated his award to his sister, Pam, and nephew, Michael, who died in 2016 following a battle with drug addiction, he said.
Through tears, Keaton said the gesture was fitting "given the subject matter" of the series for which he won.

In his impassioned speech, Keaton also referenced the Ukraine invasion by acknowledging the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a former actor-comedian who has been leading his nation in its defense against Russia.
“We have fellow actor in Zelensky who deserves some credit tonight for fighting the fight,” Keaton said.
“Given the subject matter,” he said about Dopesick, which tackles the opioid crisis, “this is for my nephew Michael and my sister Pam.
I lost Michael, and it hurts.”Keaton’s nephew, Michael, died in 2016 following a battle with drug addiction.

The project was a personal one for Keaton, whose own nephew died of fentanyl overdose.

I am blessed to be able to do something that might improve someone’s life.”“Given the subject matter, this is for my nephew, Michael, and my sister, Pam.
