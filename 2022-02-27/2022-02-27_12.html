     Monty Williams says Suns' 3 games in 4 days, no practice since All-Star break benefits them
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Phoenix didn't have a pregame shootaround, walk-through or full practice despite playing three games in the past four days.
But that's good thing to their coach Monty Williams for the Suns getting back into basketball shape after the respite.
Suns coach Monty Williams said before last week's All-Star break he hoped the Suns "fill their cup" and recharged to "continue momentum" following their eight-day rest between Feb. 16 to 24.
Maintaining momentum has been a challenge for the Suns, who have lost two of their first three games since the break.
The Suns lost their third matchup in just over a month to the Jazz, 118-114, since their home-and-home games on Jan. 24 and 26.

     Mitchell, Gobert lead surging Jazz over Suns, 118-114
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points, Rudy Gobert added 16 points and 14 rebounds and the Jazz stayed hot with a 118-114 victory over the NBA-leading Phoenix Suns on Sunday.
“We've got so much talent, it's hard to lose when we play that way,” Gobert said.
It was the second straight impressive win for the Jazz, who also beat the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday.
The Suns rallied for a 60-56 halftime lead after trailing for much of the second quarter.
Ayton had 17 points on 8-of-10 shooting before the break while Mitchell scored 11 for the Jazz.

     Phoenix Suns show improvement but not enough to beat Utah Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHOENIX — Time to dial those expectations back a bit if you were expecting smooth sailing for the Phoenix Suns without Chris Paul (and, for the meantime, Cam Payne).
Even in a game on Sunday afternoon where they played fairly well against a very good Utah Jazz team, it just wasn’t enough, and that “enough” is a much higher bar in this situation.
But the Jazz decisively won the battles in second-chance (27-14) and bench points (43-11), putting the Suns back in an uphill journey despite the great shooting numbers.
As always, the Jazz made it an arduous task to create separation, which Phoenix finally achieved prior to that spurt.
Utah shot 17-for-40 (42.5%) on 3s and Williams didn’t like the amount the Jazz got on situations where the Suns’ defender shouldn’t have gone under a screen.

     Recap: Suns unable to overcome Utah’s relentless offense, lose second straight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Phoenix Suns have lost two consecutive times for the first time in the 2022 calendar year after losing to the Utah Jazz on Sunday afternoon, 118-114.
Hampered by bench production — the team only scored 11 from their reserves — the Suns now find themselves 49-12.
Over the course of the second quarter, Utah operated at the top of their game offensively, scoring 56 points with six players scoring at least 6 points each.
pic.twitter.com/8mGwzhW44n — Phoenix Suns (@Suns) February 27, 2022Second HalfThird quarter had some silly trading of its own when Jae Crowder and Royce O’Neale were knocking down back to back to back to back triples early in the frame.
Overall the bench just didn’t do much to help out the cause, losing the scoring battle 11-43 against the Jazz second unit.
