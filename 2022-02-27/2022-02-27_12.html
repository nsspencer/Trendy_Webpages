    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Coming to the final hole, the famous par-5 with the car floating on the water, he was tied for the lead.
It was his good fortune that he managed to get off his drive—a 334-yard beauty down the right side of the fairway—just before the rains fell.
The skies opened as he marched down the fairway, and his playing partner, Kurt Kitayama, seemed loath to hit his own second shot.
Both players reached the green in two, and when Straka's 47-foot eagle putt stopped nine inches from the hole, he had the critical stroke he needed.
With only Lowry and Berger threatening, he took shelter from the rain at 10 under.

It's a lifelong dream of mine just to be heading to Augusta in a month or so," Straka said.
Full-field scores from The Honda ClassicHow it happened: Straka, like Lowry, was five shots back of Berger to begin the day.
I played the golf perfectly to win the tournament, and that's this game sometimes and that's this level."
That was enough for the win as Lowry couldn’t match the birdie and finished one back.

     ALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- It was a coronation that turned into a horse race that concluded in a driving rainstorm, with Austria’s Sepp Straka winning by a nose in Sunday’s final round of the Honda Classic.
He shot 4-over-par in the first six holes, with a double bogey and two bogeys.
It would be a lead he would not relinquish until Straka made a tap-in birdie on the 18th hole.
His strokes gained putting rank in the final round was 73rd, telling the tale on what part of his game let him down.
On 18 Straka ripped a 334-yard tee shot and was left with 192 yards to the green, but from the time he hit his tee shot until he walked to his ball, the South Florida skies opened with near torrential rain pelting the players.

     In an enthralling final day at PGA National, it was Austrian, Sepp Straka, who claimed the trophy, with a fantastic back nine display giving the 28-year-old a one shot win over Ryder Cup star, Shane Lowry.
For the majority of the final round, it seemed to be a one-on-one dual between Lowry and American, Patrick Berger.
However, after just six holes, Berger found himself one shot back of Lowry, with a huge six-shot swing making viewers at home wonder what was going on.
Stepping up to his tee shot, Lowry would pull his drive left, forcing him to lay-up.
"I tried to not think about winning (over the last few holes), said Straka.
