     NBA Twitter reacts to Warriors' shocking blown lead in loss to Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Warriors led by as many as 21 points in their stunning 107-101 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday night.
But then, the Mavericks -- led by Luka Doncic (34 points) and Spencer Dinwiddie (24 points), went on a 26-1 run to steal the lead and, eventually, the victory.
Not sure I can recall watching @warriors melt down in a fourth quarter like that.
— Colin Cowherd (@ColinCowherd) February 28, 2022The Warriors have lost in regulation after leading by more than 20 points in a regular season game for the first time since Nov. 14, 2007 against the Pistons.

     Warriors let another big lead slip away, fall to Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Warriors led for the first 44 minutes of regulation, but let the Dallas Mavericks climb all the way back from a 21-point deficit and fell 107-101 at the Chase Center.
The collapse marked the second time in three games the Warriors have allowed a double-digit second-half lead to completely evaporate.
Against the Trail Blazers on Thursday, the Warriors took an early lead and only kept building on it.
With Gary Payton II in the starting lineup in place of the injured Draymond Green for the third straight game, the Warriors’ defense came out firing on all cylinders.
On Sunday, Kuminga’s streak of nine straight games scoring in double figures came to an end.

     The Warriors held a 19-point advantage early in the fourth quarter, but then went cold down the stretch in Sunday’s 107-101 loss to the visiting Mavericks.
Dallas forward Dorian Finney-Smith gave the Mavs their first lead of the game with a tip-in at the 3:21 mark of the fourth quarter.

     Donic leads big comeback, Mavericks stun Warriors 107-101
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Outside the victorious Dallas locker room, coach Jason Kidd had a little fun with Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic.
The miscues didn't matter at the end, when Donic and Dallas did almost everything right.
Doncic converted two free throws with 7.9 seconds left, leading the Mavericks back from 21 down in the third quarter to stun the Golden State Warriors 107-101 on Sunday night.
1 Golden State and the fifth-ranked Mavericks.
Golden State has given away big leads in losing its last two home games after a 117-116 defeat to Denver on Feb. 16.
