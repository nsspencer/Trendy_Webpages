    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Now that they no longer having to work on Sunday, Matthew Stafford and Andrew Whitworth found a fun way to conclude the weekend.
The honorary guests arrived in Fontana, California, to give the command for Sunday’s NASCAR Cup Series race.
Since the left tackle and quarterback developed a tight rapport over the season, Whitworth and Stafford didn’t seem too worried about telling racers to start their engines.
LA Rams tackle Andrew Whitworth brought some help to give the command today … his quarterback Matthew Stafford.
LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford and tackle Andrew Whitworth talk about becoming NASCAR fans later in life after attending races at Talladega.

     Even though he admitted seeing Ice Cube in person might’ve factored into his decision, hip-hop head and NASCAR Hall of Famer Mark Martin was on hand at Auto Club Speedway to take in Sunday’s Wise Power 400 Cup Series race.
“It’s really an exciting time in NASCAR; it’s on an upward swing right now.
“The clinic that Tyler Reddick’s putting on out there; I mean a real talent, really showing what he can do.
Drivers have their work cut out for them in the early going with the completely revamped Cup Series racer, and the increased parity throughout the field is on full display.
“So the drivers are having to do big-time work and that’s what I want to see.

     Kyle Larson Wins Competitive, Difficult NASCAR Race at Fontana
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On one late restart, teammates Chase Elliott and Kyle Larson hit each other while racing three-wide for the lead with Joey Logano.
Larson continued on without damage, but Elliott hit the wall for the third time in what was a long race for his No.
That set up a five-way final battle over four laps between Larson, Logano, Erik Jones, Austin Dillon, and Daniel Suarez.
Larson regained the lead with two to go, then Suarez found himself being passed by Jones and Dillon over the final two laps.
That continues with the first race on a "cookie cutter" 1.5-mile track at Las Vegas Motor Speedway next weekend.

     The list of big-name NASCAR Cup Series drivers who will have to come from the rear of the field Sunday at Auto Club Speedway is now at nine.
Three more drivers joined the list overnight due to unapproved adjustments on their cars.
Team Penske had to fix the right side and right rear of Logano’s No.
A spin off Turn 2 in qualifying damaged the underbody of Keselowski’s RFK Racing Ford, which also required repairs.
Logano, Keselowski, and Larson join six drivers at the rear of the 39-car field who did not clock a time in qualifying for various reasons.

     But try as they might, even to the very last laps, the field couldn't keep him out of Victory Lane.
By all indications, it looked as though Reddick had the best car and was set to earn his first Cup win.
After spinning to bring out the final caution, Elliott ended up 26th.
That marks Hemric's first Top 10 in a Cup car since Pocono in July of 2019.
Last year, Las Vegas was the site of Kyle Larson's first victory of 2021 en route to the Cup Series title.
