The 28th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards differed greatly in who it nominated from the expected Oscars frontrunners, with curveball House of Gucci leading the noms next to more expected The Power of the Dog.
Completely snubbed were Kirsten Stewart as Princess Diana, as well as the ensemble of West Side Story (save Ariana DeBose, who won her solo category of Best Supporting).
Succession was a big contender, as three of the male stars were up for the same kiss from awards daddy, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series.
