     Happy Pokémon Day!
Yes, The Pokémon Company has decided to do its annual Pokémon Day showcase at the weekend, because no day of rest can stop this franchise.
It's set to be 14 minutes long, a little shorter than the equivalent for last year's 25th Anniversary, but we still anticipate some fun moments and reveals.
Will it be Pokémon Legends: Arceus DLC?
We'll see soon, it all starts at 14:00 UTC / 09:00 EST / 06:00 PST / 15:00 CEST / 23:00 JST, so get yourselves comfy, join in with the community live chat, and enjoy!

     A new main series Pokémon game is coming in late 2022 – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Step aside, whatever “Pokémon Café Remix” is — the ninth generation of Pokémon is coming.
This morning, a Pokémon Presents broadcast announced “Pokémon Scarlet and Violet,” the latest installment in the main series Pokémon games after “Pokémon Sword and Shield” came out in late 2019.
The Nintendo Switch games are expected to be released in late 2022.
(Update: apparently these new friends are: Sprigatito, a “capricious, attention-seeking Grass Cat Pokémon;” Fuecoco, a “laid-back Fire Croc Pokémon that does things at its own pace;” and Quaxly, an “earnest and tidy Duckling Pokémon.” Don’t ask me how any of these are pronounced.)
Find out for yourself on a replay of this morning’s broadcast:

     Nintendo announces new Pokémon games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     So, only weeks after releasing spin-off prequel Pokémon Legends: Arceus, a few months after releasing Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (two remakes of DS-era games), and just a couple of years after releasing Pokémon Sword and Shield, Nintendo has announced another brand new Pokémon game.
Or, rather, two brand new Pokémon games, because that’s how this series works.
AdvertisementTitled Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, the two games were announced as part of developer The Pokémon Company’s “Pokémon Presents” stream today with a trailer that (for some reason) opens with a live-action security guard of some sort investigating a mysterious room before cutting to, you know, regular Pokémon stuff.
It doesn’t look dramatically different from Sword and Shield, save for a vaguely Mediterranean aesthetic in the game’s world, but it will take more than a three-minute trailer for Nintendo to explain how these Pokémon games are different from the last few Pokémon games.
Make more Pokémon games, Nintendo.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There are even more Pokémon games on the way.
At a livestreamed event on Sunday morning, The Pokémon Company teased two new titles: Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
As one of the main characters, trainers will jump into the world of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet to begin their adventure, where they will have a different outfit depending on which game they are playing.
Trainers will then choose either Sprigatito, the grass cat pokémon, Fuecoco, the fire croc pokémon, or Quaxly, the duckling pokémon to be their first partner pokémon before setting off on their journey.
And the competitive battle game Pokémon Unite will also be getting some notable new features, including new, more intense fights called “fury battles” that launch today.

     Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Combine What's Working Best for the Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The newly announced Pokemon Scarlet and Violet seem to take what's working best from the current games in the series to make something brand new.
Pokemon's ninth generation of games, Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet, were just announced in the annual Pokemon Day livestream.
Updates for the side games, Pokemon GO, Pokemon Masters EX, and Pokemon Cafe ReMix, were shown, as well as new content for both Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, as well as for Pokemon Legends: Arceus.
Despite the great changes Pokemon: Legends Arceus made to the series, the game comes up short in regard to its story.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet truly seem to be the next step in the Pokemon franchise.

In fact, only the official Pokémon account in English has published a tweet, while all the others remain silent.
A previously scheduled Pokémon Presents could not be postponed.
For example, a Fire-type Pokémon will have an advantage over a Grass-type Pokémon, but a disadvantage against a Water-type Pokémon.
