     Plans to Convert Auto Club Speedway to Short Track are on Hold
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s been almost two years since NASCAR revealed plans to convert the 2-mile Auto Club Speedway into a half-mile short track.
Coliseum, Cup driver Kyle Busch said there was “no question, after what we saw today” that Auto Club would be “cut up.”Now, on the eve of the sport’s return to Fontana for the first time since March 1, 2020, when those short track plans could be a reality aren’t any clearer.
Dave Allen, the president of Auto Club Speedway, was asked about the status of the track conversion on SiriusXM NASCAR Radio’s “Tradin’ Paint” Friday.
“We definitely are looking at the potential of changing the facility to a half-mile track.
A lot of fans have said they want to see more short track racing.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     2 Whelen Chevrolet was bad fast today at Auto Club Speedway.
We started the race with a loose-handling machine, but we knew we would be good if we could get the handling right.
They did a great job making adjustments all race long, and our pit crew had fast stops today, too.
It took a good 10, 15 or 20 laps to get going and then once it got going it was really fast, but then you’re in traffic.
So those late-race restarts really didn’t help us much.

RELATED: Auto Club lineup | Fantasy preview coming into Auto Club | How to play Fantasy LiveRJ Kraft’s race-day lineup for Auto Club:1-Austin Cindric (one use already)2-Ryan Blaney3-Chase Elliott4-Tyler Reddick5-William ByronGarage: Kyle BuschNext in line: Joey Logano (if he doesn’t go to the back), Kyle Larson, Denny Hamlin, Erik Jones and Brad Keselowski.
The Stewart-Haas Racing cars weren’t impressive in practice or qualifying, so I’ll take my chances with Wallace starting 34th against Briscoe starting 24th.
Erik Jones vs. Daniel Suarez: Jones earned a primo starting spot (second) and showed some speed in practice, while Suarez was 29th in practice and posted a decent qualifying effort (15th).
My pick: Jones.
