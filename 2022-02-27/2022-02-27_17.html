“After seven formidable years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, I’ve come to the decision to retire from the game that has given me so much,” Marpet wrote.
I’ve made Tampa Bay my home and I look forward to serving this community in the coming years.
Marpet retires having allowed only 13 sacks in 4,418 pass-blocking snaps (played) across seven professional seasons, according to Pro Football Focus.

     Bucs Pro Bowl OL Ali Marpet announces retirement at age 28
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Pro Bowl offensive lineman Ali Marpet caught the Tampa Bay Buccaneers off guard Sunday, announcing his retirement from the NFL at age 28.
A second-round draft pick out of tiny Hobart College in 2015, Marpet became a starter at right guard as a rookie.
He transitioned to center the following season and later settled in at left guard, where he helped the 2020 Bucs win the Super Bowl and was a first-time Pro Bowl selection in 2021.
Thank you, Tampa Bay.”The move comes just weeks after quarterback Tom Brady announced his retirement after 22 seasons.
It also means the Bucs potentially may have to replace three offensive lineman this winter, with Pro Bowl center Ryan Jensen and right guard Alex Cappa set to become free agents in March.

     TAMPA, Fla. -- In a shocking move, Buccaneers Pro Bowl left guard Ali Marpet is retiring, he announced on Instagram.
Marpet is just 28 years old and finished off his first Pro Bowl season.
He is considered arguably one of the top -- if not the top -- Buccaneers offensive linemen.
I've made Tampa Bay my home and I look forward to serving this community in the coming years.
In addition to Brady's and Marpet's departures, Jensen, also a Pro Bowler, and right guard Alex Cappa, a Pro Bowl alternate, are set to become unrestricted free agents next month.

Overall, Marpet played in 101 games over his seven seasons, starting all of them.
