     Tampa Bay Buccaneers Pro Bowl guard Ali Marpet announces retirement from NFL at 28
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tampa Bay Buccaneers Pro Bowl guard Ali Marpet abruptly announced his retirement from the NFL at the age of 28.
Marpet made his first Pro Bowl after the 2021 season.
Marpet impressed at the 2015 NFL scouting combine, which prompted the Buccaneers to trade up to select him 61st overall.
Marpet was a key presence on the 2020 Buccaneers team that beat the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LV last season.
This year, Tampa Bay's offensive line was a dominant force, allowing the fewest sacks in the NFL (23).

     Bucs Pro Bowl OL Ali Marpet announces retirement at age 28
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Pro Bowl offensive lineman Ali Marpet caught the Tampa Bay Buccaneers off guard Sunday, announcing his retirement from the NFL at age 28.
A second-round draft pick out of tiny Hobart College in 2015, Marpet became a starter at right guard as a rookie.
He transitioned to center the following season and later settled in at left guard, where he helped the 2020 Bucs win the Super Bowl and was a first-time Pro Bowl selection in 2021.
Thank you, Tampa Bay.”The move comes just weeks after quarterback Tom Brady announced his retirement after 22 seasons.
It also means the Bucs potentially may have to replace three offensive lineman this winter, with Pro Bowl center Ryan Jensen and right guard Alex Cappa set to become free agents in March.

     TAMPA, Fla. -- In a shocking move, Buccaneers Pro Bowl left guard Ali Marpet is retiring, he announced on Instagram.
Marpet is just 28 years old and finished off his first Pro Bowl season.
He is considered arguably one of the top -- if not the top -- Buccaneers offensive linemen.
I've made Tampa Bay my home and I look forward to serving this community in the coming years.
In addition to Brady's and Marpet's departures, Jensen, also a Pro Bowler, and right guard Alex Cappa, a Pro Bowl alternate, are set to become unrestricted free agents next month.
