     LeBron James after 28-point loss: Lakers had 'no answers' for Pelicans' run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 123-95 loss is the Lakers' fifth in their last six games and the 28-point margin is tied for the second-largest loss this season.
Postgame, Lakers head coach Frank Vogel said the team needed to "flush" this loss and move on.
'No answers," LeBron James said postgame about the Lakers response to the Pelicans' above-mentioned run.
@KingJames (32 PTS, 6 REB, 7 TO) reflects on tonight's loss and looks ahead at the upcoming tough stretch of games.
With this loss, the Lakers slip to 27-33 for the season which slots them at ninth in the West.

     Lakers News: LeBron James Has ‘No Answers’ For Loss To Pelicans, Laments Turnovers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With a bundle of embarrassing losses already on their record, the Los Angeles Lakers may have finally hit rock bottom after getting embarrassed by the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday night.
At the end of the first half, Los Angeles had committed 16 turnovers, which went for 17 New Orleans points.
The Pelicans looked like a team that knew exactly how to pick apart the Lakers on both ends and LeBron James admitted they could not figure out any solutions.
“I don’t have an answer for tonight,” James said.
Obviously seven turnovers is not an ingredient for winning basketball for myself.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Source: YouTube/Rabka TigabelasThe Los Angeles Lakers put up yet another disappointing performance last night.
Playing against a mediocre New Orleans Pelicans team, the Los Angeles Lakers got blown out at their home court.
One fan, in particular, was sitting close to the bench and yelling at the players and heckling them.
And Russell Westbrook was among the many Lakers players to get booed from the crowd, although it did not seem to bother him too much.
In fact, Los Angeles Lakers owner Jeanie Buss even walked out of the game because of how poor the Lakers were performing.

     Russell Westbrook, the L.A. native whom the franchise completely overhauled its roster to acquire in the offseason, was asked if that type of reception from Lakers fans would be something he takes home with him, after his team lost for the ninth time in its past 12 games.
If they boo, they can take their ass home.
… “I can only answer if I take them home: No.
But as for our team, I don’t think it’s something we got to deal with.
And kind of move forward.”Source: Dave McMenamin @ ESPN

     Are the Lakers just committed to being bad the rest of the season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For the umpteenth time this season, the Lakers hit a new low point by being blown out on national television by the Pelicans at home on Sunday.
While it did not reveal anything new about the Lakers, it did seem to cement the fact that this team isn’t interested in actually improving this season.
No matter what the conclusion is, the end result is that the Lakers look destined for a flawed but predictable finish to the season that may not even include the play-in game at this rate.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Lakers 'season found a new low on Sunday, with a 123-95 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans being met by a chorus of boos from the Crypto.com Arena crowd throughout much of the night.
"Right now, the 27-33 Lakers are tumbling backward, with the loss to the No.
That's what it starts with," he said when asked how L.A. can begin to turn things around.
"Try to get off of this slide and get a win, and learn from that win with things you did well, things that you didn't do so well.
"Teams are coming in, playing harder, and I believe that's kind of their scouting report: Just play harder than them and see what happens," Westbrook said.

     McCollum, Pelicans roll to 123-95 win over reeling Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NEW ORLEANS — The New Orleans Pelicans are starting to find their stride since acquiring CJ McCollum nearly three weeks ago.
Two nights after a surprising win at Phoenix, the Pelicans rolled to their biggest victory over the reeling Los Angeles Lakers.
McCollum scored 22 points while Jonas Valanciunas and Brandon Ingram added 19 apiece in New Orleans' 123-95 rout Sunday night.
The 28-point margin of victory is the largest in franchise history by the Pelicans over the Lakers, surpassing their 139-117 win in 2018.
McCollum is averaging 28 points in his seven games with the Pelicans since being acquired from Portland on Feb. 8.
