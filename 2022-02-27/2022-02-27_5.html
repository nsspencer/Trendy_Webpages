     Here's What Twitter Is Saying After The Warriors Embarrassing Loss To The Mavs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Golden State Warriors collapsed against the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday night as they blew a 19-point lead in the fourth quarter, and lost by a final score of 107-101.
At one point, the Mavs went on a 26-3 run in the final period, and overall the loss was an epic failure to close the game by the Warriors.
As of late, they have cooled off in a big way, and are just 5-5 in their last ten games overall.
Luka Doncic and Spencer Dinwiddie combined to score 58 points, while Steph Curry led the Warriors with 27.
Some of what people on Twitter are saying about the game can be seen in the tweets embedded below.

     Behind Luka Doncic and Spencer Dinwiddie, the Mavericks go on a 33-8 run to end the game and defeat the Warriors.
(1:55)SAN FRANCISCO -- Heading into the fourth quarter of the Warriors' game against the Mavericks on Sunday night, all arrows pointed toward an easy Golden State victory.
For those 8½ minutes, Dallas went on a 26-1 run -- the Warriors' lone point coming off an Andrew Wiggins free throw.
But, as Golden State's offense went south, so did its defense.
And as Kerr said, Golden State is far beyond the point of depending on Green's and Iguodala's returns.

     SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Outside the victorious Dallas locker room, coach Jason Kidd had a little fun with Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic.
The miscues didn't matter at the end, when Donic and Dallas did almost everything right.
Doncic converted two free throws with 7.9 seconds left, leading the Mavericks back from 21 down in the third quarter to stun the Golden State Warriors 107-101 on Sunday night.
1 Golden State and the fifth-ranked Mavericks.
Golden State has given away big leads in losing its last two home games after a 117-116 defeat to Denver on Feb. 16.

     For three quarters that's what it was, a game that had all the makings of a classic Warriors avalanche.
But it ended up being a different kind of night for Golden State.
“I thought we kind of lost out spirit and our energy when they made that push,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said.
In the opening minutes of the game, Golden State looked unbeatable.
Throughout the Mavericks' 26-3 run in the fourth quarter, Golden State couldn't make a shot.
