     Thiago Alcantara Celebrates Liverpool's EFL Cup Win But Will He Get A Medal?
It is unclear if he will receive one, or whether he evens wants one, after not playing a minute of Liverpool's EFL Cup campaign this season.
"If you have zero games you should win a medal, if you are part of the squad you should get a medal.
The EFL Cup protocol is slightly different but again there is room for discretion.

     Chelsea vs Liverpool live score and result updates: Carabao Cup latest as Liverpool win classic 11-10 on penalties
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Liverpool won the Carabao Cup final after beating Chelsea 11-10 in an extraordinary penalty shootout at Wembley.
After a brilliant match somehow finished goalless, the first 21 penalties were all converted successfully.
Then Kepa Arrizabalaga, who was brought on at the end of extra-time, launched his penalty over the bar.
Christian Pulisic and Mason Mount missed excellent first-half chances for Chelsea, while Mendy made an astonishing reaction save from Sadio Mane.

     Liverpool might have golden £20m transfer chance to create perfect Jürgen Klopp squad in summer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Amid all the turmoil at the club, Liverpool could capitalise on the situation to lure a key target to Anfield.
According to Gianluigi Longari of Football Transfers, Liverpool target Raphinha has a £20m relegation release clause in his current deal with the club, which would be a tempting proposition for FSG.
After all, Raphinha is a target Liverpool have kept a close eye on, and one for whom they opened talks last summer according to his agent Deco.
He is the type of player who could 'complete' Liverpool's squad and ensure the Reds have the perfect depth in every attacking department.
But first there are still 12 games to go, in which Leeds United have a chance to claw their way back up the table.

     Liverpool dressing room reaction speaks volumes as Jürgen Klopp myth banished once and for all
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Twenty two penalty kicks later, it was forgotten entirely as the Liverpool team celebrated wildly in front of their supporters, Caoimhin Kelleher the hero for scoring, not saving, at a vital time.
Inside the Liverpool dressing room, Pep Lijnders took on a prominent role in the celebrations, leading the singing of Freed From Desire while head of fitness and conditioning Andreas Kornmayer paraded the trophy around.
This, clearly, is a dressing room that was enjoying themselves, but the feeling that beats even winning the trophy is that this is only the beginning of what is possible for this Liverpool side this season.
The dressing room reaction spoke volumes about what these Liverpool players want and demand from each other, and then savour when they pull off what they intended.
Their dressing room dancing and celebrating will surely have put an end to any thought that Klopp doesn't care for the cups.

City are expected to defend the Premier League title they won in 2021, but Liverpool are at least in with a shout at challenging them.

     Carabao Cup kicks off Liverpool's Quadruple quest, while Chelsea's Kepa-for-Mendy gamble backfires
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In three months' time, he could add three more and create history at the same time by becoming the first English team to achieve a quadruple of the Carabao Cup, FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League.
Yet Liverpool now have the opportunity do it after overcoming Chelsea to win the Carabao Cup for a record ninth time.
Will the Carabao Cup be the first trophy en route to a historic Quadruple for Liverpool this season?
Nobody in Chelsea's history has saved more penalties than Kepa -- 10 in total, eight in shootouts including in this season's Carabao Cup last-16 stage against Southampton.
This comes three years after Kepa refused to be substituted in the 2019 Carabao Cup final minutes before a penalty shootout.

     Jurgen Klopp clinched his first domestic cup triumph as Liverpool boss, having lost his only previous final — the 2016-17 Carabao Cup final against Manchester City.
Chelsea, meanwhile, extended an awful recent record in Wembley finals, which has now surprisingly seen the Blues lose 10 of their last 11 showpiece occasions across the FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Community Shield.
Kelleher slotted it home, whereas Kepa skied his, sending the Liverpool fans behind that goal delirious.
