    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In just a matter of a few short hours Euphoria season 2 episode 8 is going to be here, and we don’t have to tell you how big this is going to be.
However, we don’t think that this cliffhanger will be straight out of some soap opera.
Rather than some huge jaw-dropping moment, it could instead be a question or a tease for what’s going to be coming next.
The larger question we’re wondering entering the finale is rather simple: How many more seasons can a show like this really last?
