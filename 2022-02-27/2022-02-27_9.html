     White House officials and their allies on Capitol Hill fear they could lose control of both chambers if Mr. Biden is unable to turn those numbers around.
Officials said Mr. Biden will also announce new steps to confront price increases caused by a lack of competition.
Those companies have significantly increased their shipping rates through the pandemic, the White House said on Monday.
The Justice Department and the Federal Maritime Commission together will crack down on antitrust violations among shipping companies, to try to bring more competition into the sector.
Federal shipping regulators will also step up their oversight of certain practices by shipping companies, like unfair fees.

     How to watch Biden's State of the Union address
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) President Joe Biden is scheduled to deliver his first State of the Union address Tuesday night at the US Capitol.
The speech comes amid the biggest military crisis in Europe since the Cold War as Russia continues its assault on Ukraine after launching an unprovoked attack on the nation.
The speech could help give the President and Democrats a boost and provide some momentum heading into campaign season.
The address to Congress comes days after the President put forward his first Supreme Court nominee.
This will be Biden's first State of the Union address -- last year he delivered his first joint address to Congress a few months after being sworn in as president, but it wasn't considered a State of the Union address.

     Tlaib to give progressive response to State of the Union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rep. Rashida Tlaib is set to give the Working Families Party response to President Biden’s State of the Union address on Tuesday.
Tlaib — one of the members of the “Squad” of progressives in Congress — reportedly plans to criticize both Republicans and some Democrats for blocking Biden’s Build Back Better economic agenda.
Traditionally, the major political party that is not in power gives an official response to the president’s joint session to Congress.
Kim Reynolds will deliver the Republican Party’s response to Biden’s address, GOP leaders announced last week.
But in the last few years the Working Families Party has offered a progressive take on curing the nation’s ills.

     They have argued viciously in Congress over just about everything: Whether the Capitol insurrection should be investigated or brushed aside.
Email newsletter signup“I think you will see in the State of the Union, a strong bipartisan support for our president,” predicts Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a Biden ally.
It can’t be said that Republicans are fully pleased with Biden’s handling of the Ukraine war.
McConnell has been highly critical of the president’s runup to the crisis, calling the White House’s disastrous exit from Afghanistan last summer a sign of U.S. weakness that opened the door to Putin’s invasion.
Leading Republican lawmakers have derided what defense hawks view as Biden’s initial reluctance to impose sanctions to deter Putin’s advance on Ukraine.

     Biden will address a mostly full and mask-optional crowd in the House chamber, one sign of the easing coronavirus threat.
A February AP-NORC poll found that more people disapproved than approved of how Biden is handling his job as president, 55% to 44%.
“The president will absolutely use the word inflation tomorrow and he will talk about inflation in his speech,” said Psaki.
“I think you’re going to see it look much more like a normal State of the Union, " said White House chief of staff Ron Klain.
There were no specific or credible threats ahead of Biden’s speech, but there had been concerns about trucker convoys heading to Washington to protest pandemic restrictions.

     The challenges Biden faces in his State of the Union addressEnlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesAs President Biden is set to make his first formal State of the Union address Tuesday night, he and the country are facing pressing issues, from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to inflation and the continuing pandemic.
Here are the challenges he faces on those three sticky issues — and how he might handle them in his speech:1.
That could help Biden in an area where Americans didn't seem to have much confidence in him before the invasion.
Early on, the president indicated inflation would be transitory and was a result of the economy opening back up.
In the speech, Biden is going to have to show he's taking the issue seriously.

     Why Biden’s First State Of The Union Might Not Change Much
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But simply being a topic included in the State of the Union is no guarantee that Congress will act.
The audience for a president’s State of the Union is usually skewed toward the president’s party, as you can see in the chart below.
State of the Union addresses coincided with an average improvement of just 0.4 percentage points, and a median change of 0 points.
Bush 80 73 -7 Average change +0.4 Median change 0 Average absolute change 2.6 Median absolute change 2 Show more rows Source: GallupTo be sure, there have been some big swings in presidents’ approval ratings following the State of the Union.
Biden’s circumstances are different, but like Clinton and Trump, his approval rating is quite low, so the State of the Union could be a much-needed popularity boost for Biden.
