     SAG Awards 2022: Ariana DeBose Wins Best Supporting Actress
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Will the Screen Actors Guild Awards being broadcast tonight bring clarity to the Oscar race?
As Kyle Buchanan, The Projectionist columnist, has pointed out, because the Hollywood actors’ guild, SAG-AFTRA, votes on the prizes, they are considered by many to be the strongest precursor when it comes to predicting Oscar momentum in the acting races.
The awards are being handed out at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, Calif., and televised simultaneously on TBS and TNT beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern time, 5 p.m. Pacific.
The first awards went to Troy Kotsur, best supporting actor for his role in “CODA,” about a deaf family and its hearing daughter, and Ariana DeBose, best supporting actress for her turn as Anita in “West Side Story.”Here is a list of the winners, being updated as they are announced.
