    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Just as fans predicted, the Euphoria season 2 finale has left us with so many questions!
Needless to say, season 3 can’t get here soon enough!
But are we in for a long wait between seasons (as we were waiting for season 2) or will Euphoria season 3 premiere sooner than we think?
Euphoria season 3 release date predictionsI believe it’s safe to say that Euphoria season 3 will not premiere in 2022.
That said, even if we add a few more months to the time, Euphoria season 3 should premiere in the year 2023.

     Will There Be a ‘Euphoria’ Season 3 on HBO?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Just like the first season, Euphoria Season 2 only consists of eight episodes, which means tonight’s installment (“All My Life, My Heart Has Yearned for a Thing I Cannot Name”) is the season finale.
When can we expect Euphoria Season 3 to premiere on HBO?
Earlier this month, HBO renewed Euphoria for a third season.
Based on all the aforementioned information, we expect Euphoria Season 3 to premiere in mid-to-late 2023 or even early 2024 on HBO.
WHERE TO WATCH EUPHORIA SEASON 2:Euphoria is available to stream on HBO Max or HBO’s linear channel.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When we left Euphoria Season One, there was no doubt that the focus was on Rue and Rue alone.
Here's everything we know so far about Euphoria Season Three.
What's in Store For Euphoria High in Season Three?
A few days before Euphoria's season finale, Elliot himself—or Dominic Fike, as he's known in real life—appeared on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.
So we can safely rule out Elliot transferring out of Euphoria High after Season Two's dramatics, especially because his apology song to Rue seemed genuine.

     The Best &amp; Wildest Theories About Euphoria Season 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After an even more bleak and chaotic run than Season 1, Euphoria’s second season is finally barreling towards a finale.
Will Rue go to rehab again, and does her mom really intend to wash her hands of her as soon as she turns 18?
Given that Euphoria has already been renewed for Season 3, it’s possible that we won’t get the answer to some or all of these questions by the end of Sunday night’s episode.
Here are some Euphoria Season 3 theories about where the story could go next.

And with his seat at Lexi's play empty, there was worry for both him and Ashtray with their drama unfolding.

     ‘Euphoria’ Season Finale: [SPOILER] Meets Tragic End During S.W.A.T. Raid; Friendships Rekindle, Fizzle Out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Lexi’s play includes notable moments from the Season 1 finale, including that infamous carousel scene.
With the latest kill, it’s clear that Fez isn’t going to make it to Lexi’s play.
After storming out of the play, Nate loads his father’s gun and meets his dad (Eric Dane).
The clock turns back once again to Rue’s emotional eulogy for her father, which plays out in real time via Lexi’s play.
Hopefully Euphoria season 3, which premieres in 2024, will provide answers, and much more.
