     There sure have been some “what-ifs” and “if-only” things to reflect upon that would have OSU already in first place this season, but that’s every team in the ultra-competitive Big Ten.
Now it’s time for the next step for Ohio State that’s still a game or two behind because of some scheduling quirks this season.
The Buckeyes will have to battle fatigue and quick-gameplan installations as they play four games in a week, but at least there’s still a prize potentially out there.
Will the Terps kill OSU’s dreams of a regular-season crown, or can Ohio State do its part to make a mess of the top of the league?
Here’s what you need to know for the game and how we see it all playing out.

     22 Ohio State Buckeyes are really cramming their games in as they approach the final days of the regular season.
In all, Ohio State shot 52% from the field and 50% from three-point range — another major area of improvement.
Ohio State, meanwhile, is certainly not out of contention for a regular season conference title, though they’d need help to get there.
While Ohio State rattled off two straight wins, at some point, fatigue does become an issue.

     Basketball Preview: Ohio State Takes On Maryland in Final Road Game of the Regular Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ohio State avenged its January loss to Indiana to start the week and followed that up by upsetting No.
Buckeye offense coming in hotNot until Thursday had Ohio State scored 80 points in back-to-back Big Ten games this season.
Ohio State scored 86 to beat Illinois on the road three days ago.
The first-year wing seems to be getting hotter by the minute for Ohio State, which isn’t shying away from leaning on its emerging star.
Given the hot streak that Branham has been on, coupled with a healthy Liddell, Ohio State should roll once again, even in the Terps’ backyard.
