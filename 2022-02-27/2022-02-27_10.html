     February 27, 2022 at 1:22 PM ESTTodd Gilliland’s hometown is listed as Sherrills Ford, N.C., and no one can blame him for that.
Any memories prior to that age are a collection of hazy, fragmented scenes.
But when Gilliland’s plane touches down at Southern California’s Ontario International Airport this week, it will feel oh-so-familiar.
He spent his early years in Riverside, close enough to hear NASCAR Cup Series cars on the Auto Club Speedway track in the distance.
And his extended family still lives in the Inland Empire region, which surrounds the Fontana track.

     Now that they no longer having to work on Sunday, Matthew Stafford and Andrew Whitworth found a fun way to conclude the weekend.
The honorary guests arrived in Fontana, California, to give the command for Sunday’s NASCAR Cup Series race.
Since the left tackle and quarterback developed a tight rapport over the season, Whitworth and Stafford didn’t seem too worried about telling racers to start their engines.
LA Rams tackle Andrew Whitworth brought some help to give the command today … his quarterback Matthew Stafford.
LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford and tackle Andrew Whitworth talk about becoming NASCAR fans later in life after attending races at Talladega.

     Kyle Larson Wins Competitive, Difficult NASCAR Race at Fontana
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On one late restart, teammates Chase Elliott and Kyle Larson hit each other while racing three-wide for the lead with Joey Logano.
Larson continued on without damage, but Elliott hit the wall for the third time in what was a long race for his No.
That set up a five-way final battle over four laps between Larson, Logano, Erik Jones, Austin Dillon, and Daniel Suarez.
Larson regained the lead with two to go, then Suarez found himself being passed by Jones and Dillon over the final two laps.
That continues with the first race on a "cookie cutter" 1.5-mile track at Las Vegas Motor Speedway next weekend.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Defending NASCAR Cup Series champion Kyle Larson held off Austin Dillon and Daniel Suarez in a tense finish Sunday to win at Fontana for the second time.
Larson had victory in sight with eight laps to go when Chase Elliott spun and forced a race-record 12th caution.
Busch had an early spin followed by a flat tire, and Elliott ran himself into the wall early.
Seven drivers held a share of the lead early on with well over a dozen lead changes before the halfway point.
Whitworth said his second date with his wife, Melissa, was at a NASCAR race while she reported on it.

     With 20 laps to go and amidst a three-way battle for the lead with Joey Logano, eventual race winner Kyle Larson issued a block on teammate Chase Elliott, squeezing the 2020 champ into the wall.
Larson claimed over his in-car radio he did not see his teammate approaching on his outside.

Larson intends to spark conversations with his teammate and doesn’t expect it to be a lingering issue.
“I’m going to tell him exactly how I told you guys, and he’ll take it for what it is,” Larson said.

     But try as they might, even to the very last laps, the field couldn't keep him out of Victory Lane.
By all indications, it looked as though Reddick had the best car and was set to earn his first Cup win.
After spinning to bring out the final caution, Elliott ended up 26th.
That marks Hemric's first Top 10 in a Cup car since Pocono in July of 2019.
Last year, Las Vegas was the site of Kyle Larson's first victory of 2021 en route to the Cup Series title.
