     Learn More1883 Season 2 - What We Know So FarThe fate of one generation of Duttons may be up in the air following the Season 1 episode "This Is Not Your Heaven," but the "Yellowstone" prequel's outlook is considerably brighter.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Paramount+ has ordered additional episodes of "1883."
However, throughout the season, "1883" chips steadily away at both the eldest Dutton child's and the viewers' naïveté.
"The incredible storytelling and stellar performances behind '1883' have fueled phenomenal new records for Paramount+," said Tanya Giles, chief programming officer for Paramount Streaming (via The Hollywood Reporter).
Here's everything we know about Season 2 of "1883."

     Will There Be A Season 2 of ‘1883’ On Paramount+? What We Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The first season of 1883 was not only a critical darling (it earned Certified Fresh status on Rotten Tomatoes), but it also shattered Paramount+ records, becoming the most-watched title in the streamer’s young history.
WHEN WILL 1883 SEASON 2 PREMIERE ON PARAMOUNT+?
It was previously reported that Yellowstone Season 5 will begin filming in May of 2022, which is obviously a big priority.
Our best guess is that 1883 will take an extended break, with new episodes debuting in mid-to-late 2023 on Paramount+.

It follows James (McGraw) and Margaret Dutton (Hill) as they travel from Texas with the help of veteran frontiersman Shea Brennan (Sam Elliott).
The season finale followed up on the cliffhanger from season 1, episode 9, "Racing Clouds."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Nothing in 1883 gave us any insight or foreshadowing into season 5 of Yellowstone (unless Beth dies in John’s arms under a tree).
Here’s what happened on the 1883 finale.
She notices a hawk circling (the last thing she will ever see at the end of the episode is also a bird).
Both these events occur before the episode end.
Riding ahead of the train, Elsa encounters riders from a native tribe.

     ‘1883’ Producer Explains That Heartbreaking Finale (and What Comes Next)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Is 1883 the Paramount+ drama’s title or how many tears each viewer shed during Sunday’s finale?
I have to admit: I didn’t think Elsa was going to die until about two minutes before she did.
Shea (Sam Elliott) wanted to see the coast one more time — that’s what he wanted out of this journey after losing his family.
There was one way set with it — there was one version — and now there’s going to be two versions.
I think 1883 was an incredible journey.
