     Plans to Convert Auto Club Speedway to Short Track are on Hold
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s been almost two years since NASCAR revealed plans to convert the 2-mile Auto Club Speedway into a half-mile short track.
Coliseum, Cup driver Kyle Busch said there was “no question, after what we saw today” that Auto Club would be “cut up.”Now, on the eve of the sport’s return to Fontana for the first time since March 1, 2020, when those short track plans could be a reality aren’t any clearer.
Dave Allen, the president of Auto Club Speedway, was asked about the status of the track conversion on SiriusXM NASCAR Radio’s “Tradin’ Paint” Friday.
“We definitely are looking at the potential of changing the facility to a half-mile track.
A lot of fans have said they want to see more short track racing.

     NASCAR returns to Auto Club Speedway after a two year hiatus.
Jared Haas is joined by Bryan Nolen this week Sunday (Feb. 27) at Auto Club Speedway for the second race of the 2022 season.
Austin Cindric won his first race last week, the Daytona 500, and is riding a high by winning the pole at Auto Club.
After Harrison Burton took a tumble last week at Daytona International Speedway, Nolen caught up with Burton in a Frontstretch exclusive interview.
Burton discussed if he has made amends with Brad Keselowski after the Daytona 500 wreck and how the racing will be at Auto Club with the Next Gen car.

By all indications, it looked as though Reddick had the best car and was set to earn his first Cup win.
After spinning to bring out the final caution, Elliott ended up 26th.
That marks Hemric's first Top 10 in a Cup car since Pocono in July of 2019.
Last year, Las Vegas was the site of Kyle Larson's first victory of 2021 en route to the Cup Series title.
