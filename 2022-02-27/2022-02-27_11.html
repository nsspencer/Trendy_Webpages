     It has been almost three years since we were last invited into the fold of Tommy Shelby’s gang of Peaky Blinders.
Her loss was an emotional blow for the cast and crew, and a practical one: for many (me included) Polly was one of the main reasons to watch Peaky Blinders.

This was the Peaky Blinders we have fallen in love with over the past nine years – a dark, gloomy, tense, intricately planned (but never too complicated) show, full of exceptional performances and the underhand machinations of a loveable rogue gangster.
Peaky Blinders continues on Sunday 6 March at 9pm on BBC One

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SPOILER ALERT: This post contains details about the Season 6 premiere of Peaky Blinders.
Surprising as it sounds, it has been 889 days since BBC One aired the Season 5 finale of period gangster saga Peaky Blinders.
The last time we checked in with the Shelbys, a foiled attempt to assassinate fascist politician Oswald Mosley had Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy) at his wits end and pointing a gun at his own head.
Tommy’s response: “You know, Michael, when you’re dealing with a very powerful enemy taking revenge sometimes requires time.
Little does Michael know that Tommy has planted a well-sized packet of drugs into the briefcase he hands Michael before exiting the meeting.
