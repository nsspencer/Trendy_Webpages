     Peaky Blinders Season 6 Episode 1 Review: Black Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     If the swagger and action of that harbour opening belong to the Western genre, then the symbolism, with its black dog, black cats and caged canaries, is very Peaky Blinders.
An island surrounded by fog that Tommy needs to leave before it traps him?
Going into the meeting with Michael, Tommy treats the likelihood of his own death with total equanimity: “Someone may die,” he tells the Miquelon gendarme.
The devil, in the form of Oswald Mosley, is who Tommy was trying to rid the world of last season.
Tommy’s told that the IRA needs fellow nationalist Mosley alive, and that’s all he needs to know.
