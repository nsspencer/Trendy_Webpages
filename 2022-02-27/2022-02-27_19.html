     Illinois Too Much For Michigan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Michigan is now 15-12 overall and just 9-8 in the Big Ten after falling to Illinois today, 93-85.
Illinois' monstrous big man finished with 27 points, 7 rebounds and of course, the win.
Illinois has been a better shooting team than Michigan all year, but a discrepancy like that is a recipe for disaster, and that's how it played out.
Michigan simply didn't do enough on defense to make things tough for Illinois.
In this case, that's Michigan, and I'm sure Phil Martelli would say the same.

     Illinois basketball win over Michigan big for both teams, according to Dick Vitale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Fighting Illini were clinging to an 84-80 lead with under a minute left when Trent Frazier gave the Illini breathing room with a huge 3-point make.
And Michigan was looking for a resume win to push the Wolverines fully into the NCAA Tournament field.
— Dick Vitale (@DickieV) February 27, 2022Before the game, ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi listed Michigan among the last four ‘byes’ in his projected NCAA Tournament field.
While Michigan hasn't found the level that made the Wolverines a popular top-five pick before the season started — Michigan ranked No.
But since Curbelo returned earlier this month, the Fighting Illini are 5-3 and have been a bit up-and-d0wn.

     5 takeaways: Michigan basketball vs. Illinois Fighting Illini
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It would be a tall task, with the opponent being Illinois, a team that has really come to hate all things maize and blue.
Illinois found itself up 11 11 minutes into the game.
Every time the maize and blue started chipping away, Illinois would hit another big shot, pushing the lead even further.
After a Caleb Houstan steal, Jones hit a 3 at the other end, cutting the Illinois lead to just five.
A couple of turnovers later, Illinois found itself up by double digits yet again, 112 seconds later.

     Point guard DeVante’ Jones led Michigan with 25 points and 10 assists.
Dickinson, who managed just 13 points, shot 4-for-13 from the field, including 1-for-5 from 3-point range.
The chess match between Martelli and Illinois coach Brad Underwood began when lineups were released roughly 10 minutes before tipoff.
Martelli reinserted power forward Moussa Diabate into the starting lineup following a one-game suspension to give Michigan its traditional starting five.
But the furious rally was undone by the same porous defense that cratered Michigan in the first half when Plummer flamed his way around the court.
