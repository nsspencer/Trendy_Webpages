     Syracuse, N.Y. — The Duke Blue Devils delivered a haymaker that knocked the Syracuse University men’s basketball out before many had processed the game had even started.
Duke blitzed the Orange with a 14-0 run to start Saturday’s contest at the Carrier Dome, eventually built its lead to 30 points and went on to deliver one of the worst home losses in Jim Boeheim’s 46-year tenure with a 97-72 victory over the Orange.

     With vets gone, Syracuse basketball next term will be young, more athletic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Syracuse basketball head coach Jim Boeheim recently said on his radio show that three of his five starters on the current roster will be gone after the 2021-22 campaign.
Syracuse basketball has five commits in its 2022 class and is pursuing four-star guard Judah Mintz in this cycle.
Let’s take a look at what 2022-23 might appear as for Syracuse basketball.
In 2022-23, Syracuse basketball would return two starters, although one of them, Edwards, missed the tail-end of 2021-22 due to injury.
My point here is that this group in 2022-23, if we’re talking about experience-wise, will be quite young.

It was the most—and best—he’s played in a Syracuse uniform and with the Orange in need of athleticism to battle Duke’s front-court, Williams delivered.
So I just went out and played as hard as I can and it went in my favor,” Williams said.
He’s struggled shooting it, he’s been shooting it a little better in practice.”Williams has struggled to get going at various points this season.

     Syracuse Orange women’s basketball ended the regular season with another crushing loss, this time in 91-75 fashion to the Boston College Eagles on Sunday afternoon at the Carrier Dome on senior day in a game it never led.
Boston College gave Syracuse a reality check with a 95-71 thrashing in Chestnut Hill in early January.
The Eagles scored 11 of the game’s first 13 points and led 21-5 with four minutes left in the first period.
Gakdeng and Soule did plenty of damage inside, with the former scoring to make it 49-18 with inside three minutes left.
As it stands, Syracuse is the 12-seed and is in line for a matchup against Clemson in the opening game.
