     Red Sox release minor leaguer Netzer after hateful Twitter rant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Boston Red Sox have released a minor league player after he posted a series of hateful tweets, including several directed at Red Sox chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom.
A Red Sox spokesperson told NewsCenter 5 that former third-round draft pick Brett Netzer asked for his release on Sunday and the team granted it.
The Athletic's Chad Jennings was the first to report that the Red Sox officially released Netzer following a racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic rant on Twitter.
Red Sox minor-league pitcher Brendan Cellucci, a 2019 draft pick, took to Twitter to denounce Netzer's comments on the social media platform.
"It’s safe to say Red Sox fans have been shocked by the comments of a former player," Cellucci tweeted.
