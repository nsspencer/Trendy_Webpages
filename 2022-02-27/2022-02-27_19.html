     Watch : Will Poulter Calls Michael Keaton a "Wonderful Guy"Michael Keaton's win at the 2022 Screen Actors Guild Awards was bittersweet.
The 70-year-old actor won the Actor for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series for his performance in Dopesick.
Keaton's nephew, also named Michael, died in 2016 following an accidental overdose of heroin and fentanyl, and the Oscar winner got emotional at the end of his speech over his devastating loss.
"Given the subject matter, this is for my nephew, Michael, and my sister, Pam," Keaton said while trying to hold back tears.
To my sister Pam, thanks."

     Michael Keaton dedicates 'Dopesick' SAG Award to nephew who died from addiction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Actor Michael Keaton was late to the stage when accepting his Screen Actor's Guild Award, but once he was there, he made his time count.
Keaton, who won the award for his role in "Dopesick," Hulu's compelling recounting of the rise of opioid addiction in America, gave an impassioned speech in which he expressed his appreciation for the craft of acting and the ability to tell stories that can "improve someone's life."
"I'm the most fortunate person," said Keaton, who was late to the stage after taking an ill-timed bathroom break.
Through tears, Keaton dedicated his award to his sister, Pam, and nephew, Michael, who died in 2016 following a battle with drug addiction, he said.
Through tears, Keaton said the gesture was fitting "given the subject matter" of the series for which he won.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Michael Keaton missed the moment he was announced as the winner of the 2022 SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series because he was relieving himself in the bathroom.
“Sorry, quick trip to the men’s room, and it’s packed by the way,” Keaton, 70, quipped before launching into his acceptance speech.
Thank you very much.”Hilariously, Keaton isn’t the first star to miss his moment because of a need to hit the stalls.
In 1998, actress Christine Lahti won Best Actress by an Actress in Television Series (Drama) for her performance in “Chicago Hope” but was going to the bathroom when her name was called.
Maybe they could relate in a way,” Lahti recalled to People in 2017.

     Dopesick Dopesick (TV series)Michael Keaton showed off some Batman-worthy skills at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, after almost missing his win due to an ill-timed bathroom break.
After presenter Salma Hayek announced the award, she awkwardly paused while Keaton came dashing in from the audience, eventually rolling onto stage.
"I have a job where I can be part of a production like Dopesick that can actually spawn thought, conversation, and actual change," Keaton told the audience.
