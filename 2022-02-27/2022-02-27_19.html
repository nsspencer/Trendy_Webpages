The Ohio State basketball team isn’t a particularly tall team, so they have to be good at boxing out opponents.

     There sure have been some “what-ifs” and “if-only” things to reflect upon that would have OSU already in first place this season, but that’s every team in the ultra-competitive Big Ten.
Now it’s time for the next step for Ohio State that’s still a game or two behind because of some scheduling quirks this season.
The Buckeyes will have to battle fatigue and quick-gameplan installations as they play four games in a week, but at least there’s still a prize potentially out there.
Will the Terps kill OSU’s dreams of a regular-season crown, or can Ohio State do its part to make a mess of the top of the league?

Ohio State needed some help from their co-champions to do it.
Before the 2021-22 season even began, it was a roller coaster for Ohio State.
For the negatives in the front court, Ohio State strengthened their back court.

The first-year wing seems to be getting hotter by the minute for Ohio State, which isn’t shying away from leaning on its emerging star.
Given the hot streak that Branham has been on, coupled with a healthy Liddell, Ohio State should roll once again, even in the Terps’ backyard.

     22 Ohio State Buckeyes are really cramming their games in as they approach the final days of the regular season.
In all, Ohio State shot 52% from the field and 50% from three-point range — another major area of improvement.
Ohio State, meanwhile, is certainly not out of contention for a regular season conference title, though they’d need help to get there.
While Ohio State rattled off two straight wins, at some point, fatigue does become an issue.
