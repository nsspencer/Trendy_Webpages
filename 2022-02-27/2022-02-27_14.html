     Putin puts Russian nuclear forces on high alert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Press play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon PollyRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert Sunday, reminding the world he has the power to use weapons of mass destruction, after complaining about the West’s response to his invasion of Ukraine.
Putin’s threat came during yet another highly-staged meeting, broadcast to the Russian public on video, this time with his top military commanders, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and the chief of the general staff of the Russian military, Valery Gerasimov.
“The top officials of the leading NATO countries allow aggressive statements against our country,” Putin griped, a day after Germany and other European countries said they would speed weapons and other military assistance to help Ukraine battle the Russian invaders.
“Therefore, I order the Minister of Defense and the Chief of the General Staff to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty.”

     U.S. deflects Putin’s nuclear alert as another effort at escalation.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The White House avoided a heated response to President Vladimir V. Putin’s announcement that he was putting Russia’s nuclear forces on alert, casting it as another example of Mr. Putin’s moves to imagine a threat and escalate the confrontation with the West.
Officials were still debating whether to alter the status of American nuclear forces.
But for now, according to two government officials, they were trying to avoid being lured into a spiral of escalation, taking the position that American nuclear forces are on a constant low level of alert that is sufficient to deter Russian use of nuclear weapons.
“At no point has Russia been under threat from NATO,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Sunday after Mr. Putin ordered the alert.
“We have the ability to defend ourselves.”But the longer-term U.S. response will almost certainly depend on what the Russian nuclear forces do in the next several days, as the commanders of the Russian strategic forces try to demonstrate that they are responding to Mr. Putin’s vaguely worded order, delivered for the cameras, to move “Russia’s deterrence forces” to a level of “special combat readiness.”

     Putin Declares a Nuclear Alert, and Biden Seeks De-escalation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Now the question is how General Gerasimov will translate Mr. Putin’s vaguely worded order for “special combat readiness” into action.
Both Russia and the United States conduct drills that replicate various levels of nuclear alert status, so the choreography of such moves is well understood by both sides.
Whatever one thinks of Mr. Putin’s judgment, the decision to put the forces on alert in the midst of extraordinary tensions over the invasion of Ukraine was highly unusual.
Until last week, the two nations were meeting regularly to discuss new arms-control regimes, including a revival of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which President Donald J. Trump abandoned in 2019.
But the United States said last week that it was suspending those talks.

     Key questions after Putin’s nuclear announcement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Experts weigh in after President Putin put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert in a dramatic escalation of East-West tensions after the Ukraine invasion.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s order on Sunday to place Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert is part of a pattern of escalating tensions following his attack on Ukraine.
Just as in NATO, a portion of Russian nuclear weapons are in constant readiness and “can be launched within 10 minutes”, said Marc Finaud, a nuclear proliferation expert at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.
Putin’s nuclear menace is all the more puzzling because it departs from established Russian nuclear deterrence doctrine.
They were when ballistic missiles were fired at Russia’s or allied territory, when an enemy used nuclear weapons, an attack on a Russian nuclear weapons site, or an attack threatening the existence of the Russian state.

     As Putin puts nuclear forces on high alert, here are 5 genuine nuclear dangers for us all
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The risk Putin would order the use of nuclear weapons in response to a US or NATO intervention is low, but it cannot be dismissed.
As countries modernise and expand their nuclear weapons arsenals, experts around the world have been warning nuclear weapons are increasingly being seen as “usable” by the political and military leaders who wield them.
The fact Ukraine does not possess nuclear weapons doesn’t negate these risks.
This is not a far-fetched scenario given Russia’s nuclear posture, which maintains nuclear forces on high alert, and given the nuclear threats made by President Putin.
Nuclear weapons empower erratic and volatile heads of governments in despotic and democratic countries alike and create unacceptable risks for all humanity.

     How Should the U.S. Respond to Putin’s Nuclear Provocation?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Putin’s order to raise Russia’s nuclear-alert status is aimed as much at a domestic audience as it is at the West.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russia’s strategic nuclear forces to raise their alert status.
Or, at the least, to increase the sense that protest during a nuclear crisis is even more traitorous than usual.
This might seem counterintuitive: The Russians have gone to higher alert, and it would seem only prudent to answer this with a reciprocal raising of U.S. alert status.
There’s no good strategic reason to give Putin what he wants, and we should hope that President Biden will pointedly ignore this obvious provocation.

     Advertisement Does Putin putting nuclear forces on high alert change the risk of nuclear war?
In fact, Putin's words amount to the kind of threat rarely heard even during the Cold War period, when vastly larger nuclear arsenals of the United States and the former Soviet Union threatened the world with nuclear Armageddon.How does this change the risk of nuclear war?
In Russia, like in the United States, the president has sole authority to order a nuclear strike.The United States and Russia have the two largest nuclear arsenals in the world, by far.
The only time in history that nuclear weapons have been used in combat was when the United States twice bombed Japan in August 1945, and at that point the U.S. had a global monopoly on nuclear weapons.
"What does it mean to put nuclear weapons on alert?According to U.S. nuclear doctrine, the weapons' alert level is central to their role in deterring attack.
