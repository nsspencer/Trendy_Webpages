     Ukraine's Zelenskiy says he spoke to Belarus' Lukashenko
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MOSCOW, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday said on his Telegram channel that he had spoken with Belarus' leader Alexander Lukashenko, after Kyiv had rejected talks in Belarus, accusing it of allowing Russian troops through its territory.
He provided no further details so far.
Russian military vehicles pushed into Ukraine's second-largest city on Sunday and explosions rocked oil and gas installations on a fourth day of fighting in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.

     Belarus authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko gains more powers in Belarus after referendum
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has secured further power for himself in a referendum.
The amendment will allow Lukashenko, who has ruled the country since 1994, to secure further time in office and guarantee him lifelong immunity from prosecution after his eventual withdrawal from politics.
It would also allow Russian troops and nuclear weapons to be permanently stationed in Belarus in future.
The move comes as a senior US intelligence official is reported as saying Belarus is expected to send troops into Ukraine as soon as Monday to fight alongside Russian forces.
The official told Associated Press the decision by Lukashenko on whether to bring Belarus further into the war depends on talks between Russia and Ukraine in the coming days.

The Belarusian president added that Russia aimed to "restore Ukraine," without specifying what it would be restored to.
He warned that Belarusian troops are ready to deploy within a matter of hours, "if necessary."
The official said that Belarusian troops could deploy to Ukraine as soon as Monday.

     Lukashenko tells Russian media: Sanctions pushing Russia ‘toward third world war’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The authoritarian leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, tells Russian media that Western sanctions are pushing Russia toward a new world war.
Russia is being pushed toward a third world war.
Because nuclear war is the end of everything,” Lukashenko tells the Russian state media outlet Tass.
He says the US is the “sole beneficiary” of the war, and says Belarus and Moscow will enact “painful” sanctions against the West.
Russian state media has been widely discredited as pro-Russian propaganda during the war and has been sanctioned by leading online platforms.

     Lukashenko tries to consolidate power while Ukraine burns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russia sent about 30,000 troops to Belarus in recent weeks, and they’ve been used to attack Ukraine.
But Lukashenko insisted his troops aren’t taking part in the invasion, saying there is “not a single Belarusian soldier, not a single cartridge” in Ukraine.
Belarus relies on Russian cash to keep the government afloat after the EU and U.S. hit the country with sanctions.
Despite earlier insistence that the Russian troops would head home once military exercises were finished, the government now says they’ll remain indefinitely.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Lukashenko to ensure the withdrawal of Russian troops from Belarus.
