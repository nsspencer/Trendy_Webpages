     North Korea Test Fires Rocket for ‘Satellite’ as Ukraine Heats Up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     North Korea said it conducted an “important” test for a reconnaissance satellite over the weekend, launching its first rocket with ballistic missile capability in a month as global attention is focused on Ukraine.
Its official Korean Central News Agency said Monday the launch that took place a day earlier helped test high-definition photography and data-transmission systems and attitude control devices.
State media released photos showing the Korean Peninsula from space it said were taken from the satellite.

     North Korea says latest missile test part of building satellite surveillance system
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     North Korea says a test conducted on Sunday was for the development of a reconnaissance satellite system, state media reported a day after a missile launch was detected from the country.
The launch was the eighth test this year, and the first since January when nuclear-armed North Korea fired off a record number of missiles.
The last missile test, on 30 January, featured a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile with a camera fitted in its nose cone.
Previous launches of what it says are space rockets have been criticised by the US and its allies as thinly veiled tests of ballistic missile technology.
North Korea has previously successfully placed at least two satellites in orbit, the last one in 2016.

     "The test is of great significance in developing the reconnaissance satellite," the report said.

"It does, however, remind us that Kim Jong Un committed to launching a military reconnaissance satellite at the last meeting of the Worker's Party Congress," Lewis said.
"In general, it confirms that we should expect a North Korean space launch sooner or later."

     North Korea fires ballistic missile in resumption of testing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea launched a ballistic missile into the sea on Sunday, its neighbors said, in a resumption of weapons tests that came as the United States and its allies are focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
North Korea also might view the U.S. preoccupation with the Ukraine conflict as a chance to accelerate testing activity without any serious response from Washington.
The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command later Sunday condemned the launch and called on North Korea to refrain from further destabilizing acts.
This photo provided by the North Korean government shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks in a ruling party meeting in Pyongyang, North Korea on Feb. 26, 2022.
North Korea halted testing activity after the start of the Winter Olympics in China, its last major ally and economic pipeline, earlier this month.
