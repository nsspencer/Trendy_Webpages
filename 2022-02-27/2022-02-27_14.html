     North Korea Fires Rocket for ‘Satellite’ as Ukraine Heats Up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     North Korea said it conducted an “important” test for a reconnaissance satellite over the weekend, launching its first rocket with ballistic missile capability in a month as global attention is focused on Ukraine.
Its official Korean Central News Agency said Monday the launch that took place a day earlier helped test high-definition photography and data-transmission systems and attitude control devices.
State media released photos showing the Korean Peninsula from space it said were taken from the satellite.

     North Korea says it tested cameras for spy satellite
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     North Korea didn’t directly acknowledge any missile launch, but the KCNA statement suggests North Korea fired a rocket or a missile to take space-based photos.
But Lee said he couldn’t verify the quality of the North Korean cameras because it didn’t release higher-resolution satellite images.
After repeated failures, North Korea successfully put its first satellite into orbit in 2012 and second one in 2016.
He said tensions would still deepen as the United States would strengthen military drills with South Korea, which North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal, in response.
Lee said the North needs a much more powerful rocket to put a functioning spy satellite into orbit.

     North Korea's new suspected ballistic missile launch is an 'unforgivable' act if it is taking advantage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, says Japan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Military officials have said North Korea fired a suspected ballistic missile today.
The United States condemned the latest launch, and called on North Korea to "refrain from further destabilizing acts."
It said that North Korea was threatening the security of Japan and the international community, Reuters reported.
"If North Korea deliberately carried out the missile launch while the international community is distracted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, such an act is absolutely unforgivable," he told reporters, according to AP.
"Whatever the motives are, North Korea's repeated missile launches are absolutely inexcusable, and we cannot overlook considerable missile and nuclear advancement," Kishi said.

     North Korea fires ballistic missile in resumption of testing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea launched a ballistic missile into the sea on Sunday, its neighbors said, in a resumption of weapons tests that came as the United States and its allies are focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
North Korea also might view the U.S. preoccupation with the Ukraine conflict as a chance to accelerate testing activity without any serious response from Washington.
The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command later Sunday condemned the launch and called on North Korea to refrain from further destabilizing acts.
This photo provided by the North Korean government shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks in a ruling party meeting in Pyongyang, North Korea on Feb. 26, 2022.
North Korea halted testing activity after the start of the Winter Olympics in China, its last major ally and economic pipeline, earlier this month.

     North Korea Fires up 8th Weapons Test of the Year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     North Korea fired what looks to be a ballistic missile early Sunday, marking a return to weapons testing after a near monthlong pause overlapping the Beijing Winter Olympics.
North Korea’s last test, conducted January 30, involved a Hwasong-12 intermediate range missile — Pyongyang’s longest-range missile test in more than four years.
Ballistic missile activity by North Korea is banned under a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions.
North Korea on its own timelineSome analysts have warned North Korea may soon resume larger weapons testing while the world’s attention is focused on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Motivating North Korea is its ultimate goal to be recognized as a nuclear-armed state by the United States and the world, said Park Won-gon, associate professor of North Korean studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.
