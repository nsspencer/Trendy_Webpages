     ‚ÄòAmerican Idol‚Äô: Katy Perry sobs as man dedicates Whitney Houston song to 1-year-old nephew

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     "American Idol" is back ‚Äì and Season 20 is already bringing plenty of inspiring stories and tear-jerking moments.
Just ask judge Katy Perry, who was reduced to a puddle of tears in Sunday's season premiere by Tyler Allen's heart-wrenching audition.
The 24-year-old delivery driver, from Mobile, Alabama, dedicated his performance to his 1-year-old nephew Noah, who was killed in a car accident last April.
The moving song ‚Äì and Allen's soft, intimate vocals ‚Äì had a clear effect on all three judges, especially Perry, who sobbed into tissues throughout the audition.

     American Idol star Katy Perry is turning heads with her latest social media post.
Although Katy's appearance was virtual, that didn't stop the "Dark Horse" singer from pulling out all the stops with her outfit.
While the full look is hard to see on camera, Katy posted it to Instagram for fans to see.
In the photo, we see Katy rocking brown snakeskin pants with a matching knee-length coat and neon yellow snakeskin crop top.
Katy, Lionel and Luke will be reunited with host Ryan Seacrest for ABC's American Idol season 5, which will premiere on February 27.

     Now, American Idol airs on ABC, and its judging panel is made up of actual singers Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, and Luke Bryan.
Instead, the current iteration of Idol focuses on tear-jerking inspirational stories and, well, people who can actually sing.
Ryan Seacrest is still the host, a perpetually smiling mannequin-come-to-life that is essential to the Idol DNA.
First of all, it really is a beautifully-written song that captures the devastation of violence against Black people in America, specifically focusing on the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor.
It‚Äôs also hard to imagine what Fagins‚Äô future might look like on American Idol.
