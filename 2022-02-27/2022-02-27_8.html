     Like Lowry, Straka started the day five shots in arrears of Berger but made up that ground and more with a six-birdie, two-bogey 66.
His first four birdies all came inside 12 feet, but it was a birdie from just off the green from 18 feet at the par-4 16th that put Straka in a share of the lead before one final two-putt birdie at the last proved to be the difference.

But despite owning a tie for the largest 54-hole lead in tournament history, Berger gave it all back in the first 70 minutes.
Soon enough it was anyone’s game, and Straka took advantage.
After Lowry and Berger both parred 8 and 9, they made the turn in a tie for the lead.
Berger shot a four-over 74 and finished fourth, three back of Straka.

     He’s headed to his first Masters, after pulling off a huge comeback to win the Honda Classic.
“Just a poor round,” Berger said.
Luke List was also down by five entering the final round at San Diego last month.
He was paired with Lowry for the final round, and it didn’t take long for everything to change.
Straka was in the group five shots back to start Sunday, then made bogey on the opening hole.

     2022 Honda Classic leaderboard, grades: Sepp Straka becomes first Austrian to win on PGA Tour
    </h2>

     The golfer most in control of his ball on Sunday thrived when conditions got untenable late at the 2022 Honda Classic.
The victory is the first on the PGA Tour in Straka's career and the first by an Austrian in the organization's history.
"The third round I definitely didn't have my best stuff, just hung in there and grinded out a good round.
Straka, a nice hitter off the tee, pounded driver 334 yards at the last, reached the green and two-putted from 48 feet for the win.
"I played the golf, good enough golf I felt to win the tournament," said Lowry.
