     Dembélé proves himself right in Barcelona vs Athletic Club
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ousmane Dembélé reminded Barcelona why club bosses have been so keen to keep him on Sunday night.
Dembélé is said to have demanded a very high wage, something some fans are furious with due to his rich history of injuries.
His goal during Barcelona’s comprehensive win over Athletic Club left Camp Nou stunned as he fired in a strike from a ridiculous angle.
It was sensational wing play, and that’s exactly why Barca have been trying so hard to keep him.
It’s also why, if Dembélé goes to market on a free transfer, he will almost certainly get what he is asking for.

     Barcelona vs Athletic Bilbao, La Liga: Final Score 4-0, Barça cruise to easy victory at Camp Nou
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Barcelona finished the month of February in style and will remain in the La Liga Top 4 for another week thanks to a dominant 4-0 win over Athletic Bilbao at Camp Nou.
FIRST HALFMarcelino García Toral made several changes to the Athletic side looking ahead to next Wednesday’s Copa del Rey semi-final, so his gameplan with such a weakened team was to try and frustrated the Barça attack and take a 0-0 into the second half.
Despite having over 75% possession throughout the first half, Barça were not at their best offensively and struggled to create many meaningful attacks thanks to a mixture of their own wastefulness in the final third and a good, solid defensive structure by the visitors.
Over the entire half Barça only created one real chance through open play, with Gavi finding himself all alone inside the box after a pass from Ferran Torres but missing the target completely and sending the ball high into the Camp Nou sky.
Torres was soon replaced by Ousmane Dembélé, who came on alongside Frenkie De Jong to try and put the game to bed.

     Xavi set to bench three heavyweights for Barcelona vs Athletic Club
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Thanks to an almost perfect infirmary, manager Xavi is expected to bench as many as three first-team players for Barcelona’s home game against Athletic Club.
And as relayed by Cule Mania, the likes of Ferran Torres, Frenkie de Jong and club captain Sergio Busquets could be those who are expected to be dropped.
Hence, it is safe to say a break from the starting XI wouldn’t really hurt.
Araujo, in fact, hasn’t achieved full fitness yet simply because he had limited time for recovery.
Apart from that, full-back Dani Alves is most likely to return to the starting XI after missing out on the Europa League tie along with midfielder Gavi.

     Barcelona goes up 2-0 against Athletic Bilbao thanks to Ousmane Dembele's strike at the near post.
(0:50)Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored for the third game in a row and helped a much improved Barcelona to earn a comfortable 4-0 home win against Athletic Club in LaLiga on Sunday.
When asked about his side's hopes of challenging for the LaLiga title, the manager said they are taking it all in stride.
We're working with all the humility in the world, taking things game by game.
The fans rule and they can do what they want, but they have to be on our side," Xavi said.
