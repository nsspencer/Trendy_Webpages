     Ukraine claims Russia used an illegal vacuum bomb during invasion: 'Potentially a war crime'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The International Criminal Court has started investigating Russia over potential war crimes the country may have committed during its invasion of Ukraine, after a Ukrainian official claimed that Russia used an illegal weapon during the war, officials said.
On Monday, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, told reporters at the U.S. Capitol that during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the former country used a vacuum bomb, in violation of international law, Reuters reported.
PUTIN'S 40 MILES OF KILLING MACHINES TAUNT UKRAINE'S CAPITAL: LIVE UPDATES"They used the vacuum bomb today," Markarova said outside a closed congressional hearing where committee members received an intelligence briefing on the war.
A Russian vehicle capable of carrying thermobaric weaponry was spotted traveling in Ukraine, CNN reported, but there is no official determination that such a weapon was used.
"If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said during a press briefing Monday.

     Russia used powerful vacuum bomb on Ukraine, envoy says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russia used the potent vacuum bomb during its invasion of Ukraine, Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, told reporters on Monday night after a meeting with U.S. lawmakers.
A vacuum bomb, also called a thermobaric weapon, works by taking in oxygen to create powerful, high-temperature explosions.
“They used the vacuum bomb today,” Markarova said.
Okhtyrka Mayor Pavel Kuzmenko described the weapon used in the attack as a vacuum bomb.
In Washington, the White House said it had not independently verified the incidents.

     What are thermobaric weapons and how do they work?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fears have risen over the use of thermobaric weapons by Russia after the Ukrainian ambassador to the US said a vacuum bomb – another term for the weapon – had been used during the invasion.
The thermobaric weapon, also known as an aerosol bomb or fuel air explosive, is a two-stage munition.
Hellyer said thermobaric weapons were effective at their “specific purpose” of “primarily destroying defensive positions”.
Given their use is “pretty standard” in terms of Russian tactics, Hellyer said he expected to see more thermobaric warfare in Ukraine.
“It’s clear that the Ukrainians are hunkering down in some of the cities … as that continues the Russians are going to resort more and more to using … whatever weapons they have including thermobaric weapons in built-up urban areas.”Reuters contributed to this report

     Ukraine, Rights Groups Say Russia Used Cluster &amp; Vacuum Bombs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     By Patricia ZengerleWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Human rights groups and Ukraine's ambassador to the United States on Monday accused Russia of attacking Ukrainians with cluster bombs and vacuum bombs, weapons that have been condemned by a variety of international organizations.
"They used the vacuum bomb today," Markarova said after a meeting with lawmakers.
There has been no official confirmation that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.
CNN reported that one of its teams had spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rocket launcher near the Ukrainian border early on Saturday afternoon.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said she had seen reports but did not have confirmation that Russia had used such weapons.
