As a result, “Yellowstone” star Forrie J. Smith, who is nominated along with his cast in the television drama ensemble category, announced last week that he would skip out on the ceremony.
The most recognized of the ensemble nominees was “House of Gucci,” which scored individual nominations for Lady Gaga and Jared Leto.
