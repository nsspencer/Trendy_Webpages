     Orwell Would Eat These Free-Speech Warriors on Toast and Still Have Room for Bangers and Mash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Local police have cordoned off the area and the National Guard has set up a perimeter at 15 miles.
DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told a House panel Wednesday that the governance board would counter the threat of misinformation and disinformation for elections and homeland security.
They're afraid that we might actually think for ourselves.”Spare a thought for Nina Jankowicz, who has stepped up to lead this effort at the Department of Homeland Security.
And there had to be a better name for it than the Disinformation Governance Board, a monicker that sounds as though it were made of steel, concrete, and barbed-wire.
Orwell would eat you all on toast and still have room for bangers and mash.

     Port: The dumbest thing about the new Disinformation Governance Board is that anyone thinks it will work
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MINOT, N.D. — President Joe Biden's administration has announced a new agency within the Department of Homeland Security aimed at combating misinformation.
It's called the Disinformation Governance Board, or DGB, and since this idea comes from a Democratic administration, the winds of outrage it has inspired are blowing from places like Fox News where commentators have been apoplectic.
ADVERTISEMENTWhat's interesting to me is that anyone thinks this is going to work.
I suppose you could argue that there may be some small utility in this initiative in the margins.
Weaponized, figuratively, to undermine the arguments of critics and enhance the preferred political narrative of those in charge at the moment.

     Liberal media, watchdogs 'utterly asleep at their keyboards' on Biden’s Disinformation Governance Board
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden administration announced this week that a Disinformation Governance Board has been created to combat online disinformation, irking conservatives and free speech advocates who aren’t sure about potential consequences as media watchdogs on the left have stayed quiet.
"On the other hand, if the Trump administration had created a Disinformation Board, everyone knows they would have had one of their daily freak outs," Graham added.
The New York Times and Washington Post hadn’t even mentioned the "Disinformation Governance Board" as of Friday morning, according to their websites.
While liberal newspapers and media watchdogs groups have ignored the "Disinformation Governance Board," conservative and nonpartisan organizations have taken issue.
DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall believes outlets ignoring the "Disinformation Governance Board" think it’s a great idea.

     Disinformation Governance Board to tackle spread of misinformation in U.S., focusing on Russia and U.S.-Mexico border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Department of Homeland Security is setting up a Disinformation Governance Board to try to counter the spread of false information.
The board will focus on disinformation coming from Russia as well as misleading messages about the U.S.-Mexico border, the Associated Press reports.
The immediate focus will be on misinformation from human smugglers, who spread false claims about U.S. border policy to migrants to help drum up business.
"The Russians engage in… very active disinformation, misinformation, and in fact information warfare as a key part of their arsenal," Wray told CBS News' Scott Pelley.
Recent disinformation from Russia includes the false claim last month that American National Guard troops were killed fighting in Ukraine.

Elon Musk called on Thursday the creation of Joe Biden's new 'disinformation' board 'discomforting' as the president tapped a Russia misinformation 'expert' to lead the initiative.
'I write with deep concern about the Department of Homeland Security's decision to create a new Disinformation Governance Board,' he penned in a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
It is unclear how much cash will be spent on the Disinformation Board.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Supporters say it will fend off Russian disinformation efforts.
It's part of a larger DHS effort to blunt Russian disinformation campaigns, but it would go further than that.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday announced the formation of a Disinformation Governance Board that the federal government claims will fight disinformation.
The Disinformation Governance Board will be instructed to help fend off any Russian disinformation campaigns related to the war in Ukraine or the U.S. midterm elections.
"That the Biden Admin casually announced today that the Dept of Homeland Security -- a domestic security agency -- has created a 'disinformation' board is indescribably dystopian and chilling," Greenwald wrote.
