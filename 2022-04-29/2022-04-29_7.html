     POLL: Grade the Trevor Penning pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Saints traded up from the 16th pick in the 2022 NFL Draft to select WR Chris Olave out of Ohio State with the 11th pick, so there were plenty of eyes on New Orleans when they were on the clock again with the 19th pick.
While it wasn’t necessarily the splashiest move of the Draft, the Saints stayed put at 19 and selected Northern Iowa tackle Trevor Penning.
With Terron Armstead departing in free agency and signing a deal with the Miami Dolphins, the New Orleans Saints had a hole on the left side of their offensive line.
Now the Saints have a rookie in Trevor Penning to come in and compete with veteran James Hurst for the role.
You can read about the pick here, but what grade would you give the move?

     Trevor Penning goes No. 19 to New Orleans Saints, becomes highest-drafted UNI player
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trevor Penning has found his football home.
The highly touted offensive tackle became the first Northern Iowa player ever selected in the NFL Draft's opening round, going No.
Penning surpasses former UNI standout Brad Meester, who previously held the title as highest Panther drafted after going No.
Those are the biggest reasons why the Saints took Penning over linemen who racked up more spotlight time at larger universities.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Saints had two picks in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft and they spent that second pick, which came at 19 overall, on offensive tackle Trevor Penning out of Northern Iowa.
#Saints ¯_(ツ)_/¯ — Jeff Nowak (@Jeff_Nowak) April 29, 2022What grade do the Saints deserve for their selection of Trevor Penning?
Armstead’s departure meant that NOLA had a vacancy at left tackle that, prior to this move, would have been filled by James Hurst.
Dennis Allen on Penning: "He's going to be able to come in, he's going to be able to compete, and there's a lot of development with any rookie that you draft.
With all of this in mind, what grade does the Trevor Penning pick deserve?
