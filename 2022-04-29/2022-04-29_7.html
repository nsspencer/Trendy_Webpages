    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the first round of the 2022 NFL draft complete, the Chicago Bears are about to be on the clock.
While it was a whirlwind of a first round, which included a slew of the nation’s top prospects off the board, there are some potential impact players still available ahead of Day 2.
Chicago didn’t have any picks in the first round, but they have a pair of second-round selections at 39th and 48th overall.
The team has a long list of positional needs beginning with cornerback, wide receiver, and offensive line.
Before Day 2 kicks off, here’s a look at some players the Bears could target in the second round.

     2022 NFL Draft: S Jaquan Brisker, Penn State, Round 2, Pick 48
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brisker began his college career at Lackawanna College in Scranton, Penn., playing there in 2017-18.
He was selected with a draft pick acquired last month as part of a trade that sent outside linebacker Khalil Mack to the Los Angeles Chargers.
Brisker continued to pick up elements of the defensive scheme and his play has steadily transformed from hesitant in 2019 to downright instinctive in 2021.
He played with a banged-up shoulder in 2021 so his 2020 tape is a clearer indicator of his run support acumen.
Brisker is an ascending talent with the NFL traits to become a long-time starter as a Day 2 draft pick."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft kicked off on Friday night, it was all about a few key positions of need for the Chicago Bears.
39 overall, the Chicago Bears solidified their cornerback position by selecting Washington cornerback Kyler Gordon.
If this cornerback room is healthy, then the Chicago Bears completely renovated that position with a matter of two particular players.
Kyler Gordon immediately makes the Chicago Bears’ cornerback room one to reckon with.
The Chicago Bears got someone who will be able to read the quarterback in a hurry, but make a move immediately once he understands where the ball is going.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 39 pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, the Bears selected Kyler Gordon, a cornerback out of Washington.
Gordon has experience playing on the outside and in the slot, so he provides versatility for the team as Matt Eberflus works to rebuild the defense.
Gordon also has experience playing in zone defenses like Eberflus’ and does a good job of keeping the play in front of him in those situations.
Last season, Gordon surrendered only a 50% completion rate and a 47.3 passer rating, according to PFF.
48, then again at 71, but there’s a chance Poles opts to trade down from one of those spots to add more draft capital.
