     Summary: "We really looked at is as, 'Hey, what is your outcome if you don't do this trade versus what is your outcome if you stay and pick?'
But also, 'Hey, they have to play the Minnesota Vikings and all the players we're going to get.'
There's also the possibility that they have backups [as trade partners], right?
So if we don't do the trade, there are odds they can do a trade anyway.
You're always kind of factoring in many things that could happen.

     Vikings move way down in 1st round, take Georgia safety Cine - Austin Daily Herald
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Georgia safety Lewis Cine was the result, bringing the potential reward of a hard-hitting, sure-tackling, well-respected player from a dominant defense on the most recent national champions.
The catch from the 20-spot slide in the first round for the Vikings was an early third-rounder and a 12-spot jump in the second round.
Cine was the fifth defensive player from Georgia taken in the first round, an NFL record for one school.
12 pick for Alabama wide receiver Jameson Williams, a potential superstar who slipped a bit because he’s recovering from a torn ACL.
The Vikings have six-time Pro Bowl pick Harrison Smith entrenched at one safety spot, but he’s 33.

     Summary: The Vikings will be busy on Friday night, holding three of the next 45 picks (for now).
If you thought the Vikings were busy on Day 1 of the 2022 NFL Draft, just wait until you see the action Day 2 brings.
The Vikings traded down from 12 to 32 in a deal with the Lions, also sending the 46th pick to Detroit and receiving picks 34 and 66.
50: Skyy Moore, WR, Western MichiganIt seems likely that the Vikings' pick at 34 will come from that group, though nothing is certain in a draft like this one.
