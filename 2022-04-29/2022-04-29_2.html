    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fourth season has also become a family affair, adding a deeper hook to the Byrde saga that delivers tension right up until the last frame.
Julia Garner in 'Ozark.'
Similarly, the bifurcated season has explored the Byrdes' fractured alliance with Ruth (Julia Garner), while providing necessary reminders of the collateral damage done in their gradual descent into this world of illegality.
The performances are, again, sensational, with Garner standing out in a home stretch that showcases just how tough and determined Ruth can be.
Richard Thomas also plays a more significant role as Wendy's estranged father, who has come back into her life and, like almost everything else in "Ozark," complicated it.

At the same time, she’s around the same age as he was when he wrote that album.
I also felt the way the album lays out, it feels very whole, but there are different moods in there that were going to suit what we shot.
“You ever wonder if he’d trade that record if it meant not having to go through all that shit?” Langmore asks Mike.

     ‘Ozark’ Ending Tests the Meaning of a Netflix Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By now, some obsessive “Ozark” fans will have already plowed through the show’s final seven hour-long episodes, which appeared early Friday morning on Netflix.
“As a viewer, I love being able to immerse myself and keep going,” Mr. Mundy said.
Once, the series finale was the ultimate group ritual of TV fandom.
The end of “Ozark” raises the question: Does a long-awaited series finale have as much impact when fans don’t experience it in unison?
“There’s this feeling of, we’ve invested five years in this thing, so doing it together seems more substantive,” Mr. Mundy said.

     Netflix's 'Ozark' ends as a thrilling, yet disappointing take on a criminal family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet, here I am, dissecting the complicated legacy of Netflix's Ozark, which drops its final seven episodes on the streamer today.
Shows which have as many plotlines in motion as Ozark can feel rushed in their final episodes as they plow through circumstances to reach the finish line.
The story 'Ozark' is really tellingThere are some big deaths in the series' finale (again, saying who would be a spoiler).
Ozark has a lot of in common with Breaking Bad, but one place where it diverges is in the impact of criminality on a family.
These actors and the wonderfully delicious circumstances producers put them in, kept me watching every second of every Ozark episode, even when aspects of show didn't quite meet the definition of exceptional TV.
