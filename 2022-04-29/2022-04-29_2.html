     Why Madison Cawthorn triggers Republicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is not exactly shocking news to consumers of mainstream media to hear Republicans on Capitol Hill like to tie one on.
None of that information will penetrate the information bubble Republican voters have constructed for themselves, of fundamentalist YouTubers and Facebook personalities like Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens.
RELATED: Fellow Republican rips freshman GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn over "insane" threat of "bloodshed"That's why the leakers of these photos and video believe that it will damage Cawthorn.
But for people who live inside the conservative media bubble, this sort of stuff could easily be read as Satanic decadence.
The Republican goal here is clearly getting Cawthorn out of Congress and, more crucially, out of the right-wing media ecosystem.

     Madison Cawthorn Continues to Face Criticism Amid String of Controversies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "There needs to be a thorough and bipartisan inquiry into the matter by the House Ethics Committee."
There have also been allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct made against Cawthorn by women who attended college with him.
That comment caused notable friction between Cawthorn and other members of the GOP, including House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who said the young lawmaker had "lost [his] trust."
Since then, headlines have continued to mount, though Cawthorn has dismissed the most recent criticism as a "coordinated assault" coming from RINOs (Republicans in Name Only).
Cawthorn is currently running in a crowded GOP primary in North Carolina's 13th District though voters have attempted to challenge his candidacy.

     Timeline of Madison Cawthorn controversies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Madison Cawthorn ( R-N.C.) has been a lightning rod for controversy.
And Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) on Wednesday called for a House Ethics Committee investigation into Cawthorn over allegations of insider trading.
The Asheville Citizen Times reported that Cawthorn was facing three citations for incidents occurring across three counties in North Carolina.
“Insider trading by a member of Congress is a serious betrayal of their oath, and Congressman Cawthorn owes North Carolinians an explanation.
Tillis has come out in support of a primary challenger to Cawthorn, state Sen. Chuck Edwards (R), in recent weeks.
