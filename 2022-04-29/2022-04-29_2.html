     Ozark Season 4 Part 2 Clip: Ruth Meets A Rap Legend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ozark Season 4 Part 2 Clip: Ruth Meets A Rap LegendWhen Ruth Langmore, played by Emmy winner Julia Garner, sets out on a revenge quest in "Ozark," she looks to music for inspiration.
"Ozark" Season 4: Part 2, which hits Netflix today, sees Ruth gunning for Javi Elizonndro (Alfonso Herrera) after the shocking events of the Season 4: Part 1 finale.
Along the way, Ruth is bumping some hip-hop, specifically, Nas, and she's bumping into another rap legend, Killer Mike, who's here to cameo and talk music with her.
Killer Mike made his musical debut in 2000 on the classic Outkast album, "Stankonia," and he would go on to play himself in the film "ATL," which co-starred Outkast's Big Boi.
Now, the Atlanta-born rapper can add "Ozark" to his list of acting credits, courtesy of the Season 4: Part 2 premiere.

     Summary: Learn MoreEvery Symbol On The Ozark Season 4 Part 2 Episode Title Cards ExplainedContains spoilers for "Ozark" Season 4, Part 2After four seasons on the streamer, Netflix's "Ozark" has finally come to its inevitably tragic end.
Ever since the pilot ("Sugarwood"), each episode of the series has been introduced with an opening title card of four unique symbols surrounded by an O.
Although it may not be entirely obvious to viewers each time, every hieroglyph is guaranteed to have some significance in the episode.
Like we did for every symbol in Season 4, Part 1, we're going to explain the purpose of each and every title card in Season 4, Part 2.
Starting with Season 4, Episode 8, we'll review the symbols episode by episode, starting in the top row, moving left to right, and then doing the same on the bottom row.

     Ozark season 4, part 2 review – the Byrde family’s final bid for freedom brings sobering truths
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This review of Netflix’s Ozark season 4, part 2, does not contain spoilers.
Ozark had fourteen episodes to articulate the Byrde family’s final bid for freedom in season 4.
And I suppose that’s what comes to mind in Ozark season 4, part 2, the sobering truths.
The final bid for freedom raises plenty of questions about how our universe is manufactured.
The truth behind the final bid for freedom, heralded by Wendy, and operated by Marty, is that there’s a weight of darkness to it regardless of whether they win that bid or not.

     Who Lives and Who Dies in the 'Ozark' Finale? Season 4 Ending Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ozark Season 4 was always going to take the season out with a bang—but Netflix viewers did not expect that to literally be the case.
Ruth Langmore (played by Julia Garner), Wendy Byrde (Laura Linney) and Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) were among the top predictions for who would die in Ozark Season 4, Episode 16 (titled "A Hard Way to Go").
Here's who made it to the end of the show, and who died across the final hour of the Netflix seriesWho Died in the 'Ozark' Season 4 Finale?
So it was with the last episode of Ozark, where Camila Elizonndro (Veronica Falcón) tied up all the loose ends before taking over the cartel.
This is possible but less likely—if we learned anything from this episode, it is that Wendy and Marty can withstand anything.
