The performances are, again, sensational, with Garner standing out in a home stretch that showcases just how tough and determined Ruth can be.
“Ozark” deftly builds toward that answer, delivering it in a thought-provoking way that cements its place among Netflix’s finest dramas.
“Ozark” begins its final run of episodes April 29 on Netflix.

     Summary: I enjoyed him, I really enjoyed Javi.
On the contrary, I was – and that's why it's so fun to play Javi, because the possibilities are, it's so unpredictable.
He's so unpredictable that I did five or six takes, different from each one another, and each option could fit in.
I really enjoyed Javi, and I really laughed reading the script.
It's the appeal of a magnetic yet dangerous predator, the unpredictable force that menaces the protagonists with aplomb.

     Summary: By now, some obsessive “Ozark” fans will have already plowed through the show’s final seven hour-long episodes, which appeared early Friday morning on Netflix.
“As a viewer, I love being able to immerse myself and keep going,” Mr. Mundy said.
Once, the series finale was the ultimate group ritual of TV fandom.
The end of “Ozark” raises the question: Does a long-awaited series finale have as much impact when fans don’t experience it in unison?
“There’s this feeling of, we’ve invested five years in this thing, so doing it together seems more substantive,” Mr. Mundy said.

     Summary: And yet, here I am, dissecting the complicated legacy of Netflix's Ozark, which drops its final seven episodes on the streamer today.
Shows which have as many plotlines in motion as Ozark can feel rushed in their final episodes as they plow through circumstances to reach the finish line.
The story 'Ozark' is really tellingThere are some big deaths in the series' finale (again, saying who would be a spoiler).
Ozark has a lot of in common with Breaking Bad, but one place where it diverges is in the impact of criminality on a family.
These actors and the wonderfully delicious circumstances producers put them in, kept me watching every second of every Ozark episode, even when aspects of show didn't quite meet the definition of exceptional TV.
