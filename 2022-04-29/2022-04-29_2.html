     Chicago Bears should go get one of these players on Day 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After Round 1 of the 2022 NFL Draft, the Chicago Bears should be feeling pretty good about themselves.
That could also work to the Bears’ advantage in Round 2, for those teams looking to move up and snag a quarterback.
Round 2 of the 2022 NFL Draft could be setting up nicely for Ryan Poles and the Chicago Bears.
Again, the Bears might only have to move up a couple of picks to snag one of these game-changers.
These three, though, could end up giving Chicago first-round talent on Day 2.

     Don’t Let The Chicago Bears Land This Player, NFL. You’ve Been Warned
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He played on the best defense in the entire country last season at Georgia and was arguably its best player.
He finished with the second-most tackles (72), second-most sacks (6), most tackles for a loss (10.5), and third-most interceptions (2) on the team.
Don’t forget this team already has Roquan Smith on the roster, a Pro Bowler in all but name.
Adding a talent like Dean alongside him threatens to create the best combination this team has seen since Brian Urlacher and Lance Briggs.
This is another case of teams overlooking evident football ability just because a guy doesn’t precisely fit the ideal measurables.

     5 best remaining options for Chicago Bears in 2nd round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bears didn’t have a selection in the first round so we are still waiting to see what a draft selection looks like from new general manager Ryan Poles.
Based on how round one went on Thursday, there is a lot to be excited about.
There was also a string of wide receivers taken in the first round which is not the best news.
The Chicago Bears need a good one really bad and now they are going to have a bit slimmer pickings than they originally thought.
There are still going to be a lot of good players available to the Chicago Bears.

     Bears' 53-man roster projection ahead of 2022 NFL draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 NFL draft is upon us, where the Chicago Bears will add a new rookie class to their ranks.
For new general manager Ryan Poles, it won’t be easy with just six picks, including none in the first round.
But with two second-round picks — and a high third-round pick at 71st overall — there’s a real opportunity to add impact players that can contribute immediately.
While the Bears will be adding more names to the roster this draft weekend — from draft picks to undrafted free agents — here’s a look at what Chicago’s 53-man roster could look like right now (without the new additions).

     Summary: Bears general manager Ryan Poles said he won’t get “too cute” with his scouting of draft prospects.
They have to be able to do that.”What I think: In Darnell Mooney, the Bears have a receiver who fits what Poles is describing.
For the Bears, Eberflus’ insistence on finding “explosive, athletic ability” will factor into their board.
And, as Eberflus also explained, the versatility of players on the team and those in the draft will be measured.
If you listen to Eberflus, bad tacklers won’t fair well on the Bears’ draft board.
