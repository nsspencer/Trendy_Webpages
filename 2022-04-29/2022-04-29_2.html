     Summary: The fourth season has also become a family affair, adding a deeper hook to the Byrde saga that delivers tension right up until the last frame.
Julia Garner in 'Ozark.'
Similarly, the bifurcated season has explored the Byrdes' fractured alliance with Ruth (Julia Garner), while providing necessary reminders of the collateral damage done in their gradual descent into this world of illegality.
The performances are, again, sensational, with Garner standing out in a home stretch that showcases just how tough and determined Ruth can be.
Richard Thomas also plays a more significant role as Wendy's estranged father, who has come back into her life and, like almost everything else in "Ozark," complicated it.

     Summary: On this great occasion, I'd like to call out a rather legendary cameo in the first episode of the Part Two drop: Killer Mike, one half of hip-hop duo Run The Jewels, who appears as himself.
In the episode, titled "The Cousin of Death," we see Ruth Langmore driving to Chicago, on her way to attempt revenge on Javi Alessandro for killing her cousin .
While grabbing coffee at a diner, Ruth spots Killer Mike at one of the booths.
"I always thought it was so hopeful and fucking cruel at the same time.”Don't get me wrong—any and all appearances of Killer Mike on my TV are welcome.
Maybe he'd say that.

     Summary: The end is weighing heavy on Mexican actor Alfonso Herrera.
The unease doesn’t stem from aging or global catastrophes but rather from sharing with the world the final season of Netflix’s popular crime drama, "Ozark," released on Friday.
Alfonso Herrera as Javi and Felix Solis as Omar Navarro in a scene from "Ozark."
From there, he began booking steady television work in Mexico City, including the Latin American phenomenon that was "Rebelde."

     How ‘Ozark’ Cinematography Put a ‘Sense of Danger in the Shadows’ for Season 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “When we started opening up the background, as you’ll see in part two, there’s a little bit more in focus, overall,” he explains.
“In terms of light, it’s mostly about denser shadows, elevated contrast — a bit more noir,” he says.
And then we introduce a little bit in there, balance it up a little bit to get a little bit of an edge to it so it’s not so stark, dark foreground and bright backgrounds.
It’s all about subtly shifting the viewer’s perspective.”With this being the final season, Kim says there was an impetus to add a kind of visual exclamation point.
Customarily, the world of “Ozark” has a rich cyan-filtered look to it, “almost monochromatic,” he says.

     Netflix's 'Ozark' ends as a thrilling, yet disappointing take on a criminal family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet, here I am, dissecting the complicated legacy of Netflix's Ozark, which drops its final seven episodes on the streamer today.
Shows which have as many plotlines in motion as Ozark can feel rushed in their final episodes as they plow through circumstances to reach the finish line.
The story 'Ozark' is really tellingThere are some big deaths in the series' finale (again, saying who would be a spoiler).
Ozark has a lot of in common with Breaking Bad, but one place where it diverges is in the impact of criminality on a family.
These actors and the wonderfully delicious circumstances producers put them in, kept me watching every second of every Ozark episode, even when aspects of show didn't quite meet the definition of exceptional TV.
