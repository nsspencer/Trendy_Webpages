     Trevor Bauer Suspended for Two Seasons Amid Abuse Claim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trevor Bauer of the Los Angeles Dodgers has been suspended by Major League Baseball for two seasons, effective immediately, for violating the league’s domestic violence and sexual assault policy.
It came after an investigation by the league into allegations that he had sexually assaulted a woman.
Bauer, who joined the Dodgers last season as a free agent, was placed on administrative leave, with pay, on July 2.
Other assault allegations have been reported by The Washington Post — one of which was first reported on Friday following the announcement of Bauer’s suspension.
Bauer, 31, has been vocal in his own defense throughout the process and has filed multiple lawsuits against various people, including media members.

     Everything you need to know about Trevor Bauer's suspension: What's next for Dodgers pitcher?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Left unsaid is the massive difference between a prosecutor believing they can prove charges beyond a reasonable doubt, and conduct that runs afoul of MLB's domestic violence policy.
And the vast majority of MLB's domestic violence suspensions have fallen within that lane.
The arbitrator's ruling will ultimately be binding and can conclude in numerous fashions: Upholding the suspension, overturning the suspension or reducing it.
Bauer was paid during his nearly 10 months on administrative leave, but his MLB suspension is unpaid.
The ruling will also set a new precedent for MLB's domestic violence policy, after seven years in which punishment was always agreed upon, with or without definitive guidance from the legal system.

     Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer is suspended over sexual assault allegations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer was suspended Friday for two full seasons without pay by Major League Baseball for violating the league's domestic violence and sexual assault policy, which he denies.
"In the strongest possible terms, I deny committing any violation of the league's domestic violence and sexual assault policy," he said Friday in a statement.
The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault.
Bauer was placed on administrative leave last July 2 under the joint domestic violence and sexual assault policy of MLB and the players' association.
"The Dodgers organization takes all allegations of this nature very seriously and does not condone or excuse any acts of domestic violence or sexual assault," the team's statement said.

     What we know and don't know about the two-season ban
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The ban -- which covers two full seasons -- is the longest punishment under the sport's domestic violence policy since it was instituted in August of 2015.
Does MLB's 324-game suspension start now or include the time Bauer has already missed?
The domestic violence policy doesn't specify when this hearing needs to take place, and there is no timetable at the moment.
If an independent arbiter upholds MLB's suspension, the Dodgers probably won't have to pay Bauer anything other than what they already have.
How does this compare with other suspensions MLB has given since instituting its domestic violence policy in August 2015?

     Dodgers knew Trevor Bauer was risk, and they're paying the price
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trevor Bauer has made 17 starts for the Dodgers, and he probably won’t make any more after he was suspended on Friday for two seasons for violating baseball’s sexual assault and domestic violence policy.
When Bauer’s three-year agreement was finalized in February of last year, the Dodgers viewed the contract as a steal.
Dodgers Trevor Bauer suspended for 324 games by MLB; new accuser emerges Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer will appeal a two-year suspension to an arbitrator.
The Dodgers believed they were paying $85 million for about 60 regular-season starts by Bauer at his prime of his career — plus whatever he did in the postseason.
While none of this was illegal, what Bauer represented was the opposite of what the Dodgers claim to be.

     Summary: The Columbus woman asked not to be named, and The Post typically does not name alleged victims of domestic violence unless they ask to be identified.
AdvertisementThe Columbus woman shared photos and screenshots of text messages documenting that she had a relationship with Bauer.
The Columbus woman said Bauer began choking her unconscious during sex without them ever speaking of it first.
The Columbus woman said she expects people may not understand why she continued to stay with Bauer as the alleged abuse continued.
As she followed the coverage of the restraining order hearing, the Columbus woman began to feel an obligation to share her story.
