Back-to-Back Titles for Manchester City?
Across the Atlantic, Manchester City remains at the top of the English Premier League despite the ill-wishes of Liverpool enthusiasts and broken Manchester United supporters.
With just five games left in the top flight season, City needs to win out in order to ensure they are crowned champions of England for a second year in a row.
Liverpool trail City by only one point and will certainly continue to pressure the current champions by continuing their 10-game unbeaten streak in all competitions.

     Why the 49ers can be patient with Deebo Samuel, unlike the Titans with A.J. Brown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2023, the Tennessee Titans are $240,000 over the salary cap with 37 players under contract (not including a potential extension for Brown).
San Francisco had the ability to be patient and call Deebo Samuel’s bluff because they have budgeted $22-24M annually for a Samuel extension.
Hill’s new extension includes an annual average of $30M, including $72M in total guarantees and $52.5M in full guarantees.
Adams’ new extension includes an annual average of $28M, including $65M in total guarantees and $22.8 in full guarantees.
Their salary cap situation is tied up with highly-paid defensive players and Ryan Tannehill.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA CLARA — Business picks up today for the 49ers in the NFL draft.
Well, that’s unlikely for Deebo Samuel, seeing how he wasn’t dealt amid Thursday’s first round like two other wide receivers were from his 2019 draft class.
DEFENSIVE END: Three of the draft’s first five picks hit this spot, then two more later in the opening round.
OTHER NOTES— No running backs nor tight ends were taken in the first round, and only four cornerbacks were picked.
— Here were the first-round products from among the 49ers’ 2022 opponents:Cardinals: WR Marquise Brown; trade with BaltimoreSeahawks: OT Charles Cross, No.

     NFL Draft comes alive with receiver trades but not for 49ers’ Deebo Samuel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not yet, and not likely as the draft unfolds pick by pick.
When the draft opened just after 5 p.m., Samuel posted an Instagram video of him boarding a plane in Southern California.
In that first hour, the Jets used both their first-round picks, and neither was ticketed in a trade for Samuel.
Samuel will be signing autographs at the NFL Draft Experience from 3:45 p.m. to 5 p.m. Friday.
The best leverage he may have had faded as each draft pick was used Thursday.
