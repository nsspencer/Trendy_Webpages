     MLB suspends Dodgers star pitcher Trevor Bauer for 2 seasons over violation of sexual assault policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MLB suspended Trevor Bauer for two seasons after completing an investigation into sexual assault allegations against the star Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher, Commissioner Rob Manfred announced Friday.
In a statement, the league said Bauer violated its Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy and wouldn't be paid during the suspension, which amounts to 324 games.
In 2021, Bauer signed a three-year deal with the Dodgers worth $102 million.
"In the strongest possible terms, I deny committing any violation of the league's domestic violence &amp; sexual assault policy," he wrote.
In February 2021, Bauer signed a unique three-year deal with the Dodgers.

     Trevor Bauer Suspended for Two Seasons Amid Abuse Claim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a series of extensions of his administrative leave last season, his year officially ended on Sept. 21, when his administrative leave was extended through the end of the season.
If an appeal is not granted, Bauer stands to lose $64 million in salary, according to Spotrac.
In the N.F.L., where Deshaun Watson was accused of sexual assault by numerous women — he has denied all allegations — the young quarterback was given a contract by the Cleveland Browns that guaranteed him $230 million.
“The Dodgers organization takes all allegations of this nature very seriously and does not condone or excuse any acts of domestic violence or sexual assault,” the statement said.
“We’ve cooperated fully with MLB’s investigation since it began, and we fully support MLB’s Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Child Abuse Policy, and the Commissioner’s enforcement of the Policy.”Bauer is the 15th player to be suspended as part of the league’s policy on domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yet unlike the 15 players previously suspended under MLB's domestic violence policy, Bauer will contest his suspension to the end.
Since MLB and the MLB Players' Association jointly agreed to its domestic violence policy in 2015, all 15 players have accepted or negotiated suspensions ranging in length from 15 to 162 games.
Any suspension under the domestic violence policy would be unpaid.
"In the strongest possible terms, I deny committing any violation of the league’s domestic violence and sexual assault policy," Bauer said in a statement released by his representatives.
"We’ve cooperated fully with MLB's investigation since it began, and we fully support MLB’s Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Child Abuse Policy, and the Commissioner’s enforcement of the Policy.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bauer will not be paid during the suspension, which takes effect immediately and will stretch into the 2024 season.
His suspension is by a substantial margin the longest in the history of the policy, which dates back to 2016.
The league's collectively bargained domestic violence policy allows MLB to discipline Bauer even if no criminal charges are filed.
It reads:Today we were informed that MLB has concluded its investigation into allegations that have been made against Trevor Bauer, and the Commissioner has issued his decision regarding discipline.
The Dodgers organization takes all allegations of this nature very seriously and does not condone or excuse any acts of domestic violence or sexual assault.
