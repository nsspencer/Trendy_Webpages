    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This was Trevor Bauer from three years ago, over lunch in suburban Cleveland, describing the forces that drove him.
“I want to be a billionaire,” Bauer said, the same way you might order a sandwich.
“Not because I care about the money at all, just because that’s the highest level of achievement in the business world.
I want to win a World Series to do it.
It’s part of what makes me somewhat unhappy a lot in my life, is I don’t celebrate my successes.

     Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer is suspended over sexual assault allegations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer was suspended Friday for two full seasons without pay by Major League Baseball for violating the league's domestic violence and sexual assault policy, which he denies.
"In the strongest possible terms, I deny committing any violation of the league's domestic violence and sexual assault policy," he said Friday in a statement.
The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault.
Bauer was placed on administrative leave last July 2 under the joint domestic violence and sexual assault policy of MLB and the players' association.
"The Dodgers organization takes all allegations of this nature very seriously and does not condone or excuse any acts of domestic violence or sexual assault," the team's statement said.

     Trevor Bauer domestic violence suspension: MLB hands Dodgers pitcher two-year ban without pay
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bauer will not be paid during the suspension, which takes effect immediately and will stretch into the 2024 season.
His suspension is by a substantial margin the longest in the history of the policy, which dates back to 2016.
The league's collectively bargained domestic violence policy allows MLB to discipline Bauer even if no criminal charges are filed.
It reads:Today we were informed that MLB has concluded its investigation into allegations that have been made against Trevor Bauer, and the Commissioner has issued his decision regarding discipline.
The Dodgers organization takes all allegations of this nature very seriously and does not condone or excuse any acts of domestic violence or sexual assault.

     Dodgers knew Trevor Bauer was risk, and they're paying the price
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trevor Bauer has made 17 starts for the Dodgers, and he probably won’t make any more after he was suspended on Friday for two seasons for violating baseball’s sexual assault and domestic violence policy.
When Bauer’s three-year agreement was finalized in February of last year, the Dodgers viewed the contract as a steal.
Dodgers Trevor Bauer suspended for 324 games by MLB; new accuser emerges Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer will appeal a two-year suspension to an arbitrator.
The Dodgers believed they were paying $85 million for about 60 regular-season starts by Bauer at his prime of his career — plus whatever he did in the postseason.
While none of this was illegal, what Bauer represented was the opposite of what the Dodgers claim to be.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Major League Baseball announced a 324-game suspension for Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer on Friday, the equivalent of two full seasons and by far the most severe punishment handed out under the sport's domestic violence policy.
Bauer promptly released a statement announcing he was appealing the suspension, thus becoming the first player to contest punishment through MLB's domestic violence policy.
"In the strongest possible terms, I deny committing any violation of the league's domestic violence and sexual assault policy," Bauer's statement read.
She is the third known woman to accuse Bauer of sexual assault.
We've cooperated fully with MLB's investigation since it began, and we fully support MLB's Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Child Abuse Policy, and the Commissioner's enforcement of the Policy.

     Summary: The Columbus woman asked not to be named, and The Post typically does not name alleged victims of domestic violence unless they ask to be identified.
AdvertisementThe Columbus woman shared photos and screenshots of text messages documenting that she had a relationship with Bauer.
The Columbus woman said Bauer began choking her unconscious during sex without them ever speaking of it first.
The Columbus woman said she expects people may not understand why she continued to stay with Bauer as the alleged abuse continued.
As she followed the coverage of the restraining order hearing, the Columbus woman began to feel an obligation to share her story.
