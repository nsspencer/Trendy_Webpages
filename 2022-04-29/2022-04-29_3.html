     Ozark Season 4 Part 2 Clip: Ruth Meets A Rap Legend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ozark Season 4 Part 2 Clip: Ruth Meets A Rap LegendWhen Ruth Langmore, played by Emmy winner Julia Garner, sets out on a revenge quest in "Ozark," she looks to music for inspiration.
"Ozark" Season 4: Part 2, which hits Netflix today, sees Ruth gunning for Javi Elizonndro (Alfonso Herrera) after the shocking events of the Season 4: Part 1 finale.
Along the way, Ruth is bumping some hip-hop, specifically, Nas, and she's bumping into another rap legend, Killer Mike, who's here to cameo and talk music with her.
Killer Mike made his musical debut in 2000 on the classic Outkast album, "Stankonia," and he would go on to play himself in the film "ATL," which co-starred Outkast's Big Boi.
Now, the Atlanta-born rapper can add "Ozark" to his list of acting credits, courtesy of the Season 4: Part 2 premiere.

     Ozark season 4, part 2 review – the Byrde family’s final bid for freedom brings sobering truths
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This review of Netflix’s Ozark season 4, part 2, does not contain spoilers.
Ozark had fourteen episodes to articulate the Byrde family’s final bid for freedom in season 4.
And I suppose that’s what comes to mind in Ozark season 4, part 2, the sobering truths.
The final bid for freedom raises plenty of questions about how our universe is manufactured.
The truth behind the final bid for freedom, heralded by Wendy, and operated by Marty, is that there’s a weight of darkness to it regardless of whether they win that bid or not.

     Who Lives and Who Dies in the 'Ozark' Finale? Season 4 Ending Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ozark Season 4 was always going to take the season out with a bang—but Netflix viewers did not expect that to literally be the case.
Ruth Langmore (played by Julia Garner), Wendy Byrde (Laura Linney) and Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) were among the top predictions for who would die in Ozark Season 4, Episode 16 (titled "A Hard Way to Go").
Here's who made it to the end of the show, and who died across the final hour of the Netflix seriesWho Died in the 'Ozark' Season 4 Finale?
So it was with the last episode of Ozark, where Camila Elizonndro (Veronica Falcón) tied up all the loose ends before taking over the cartel.
This is possible but less likely—if we learned anything from this episode, it is that Wendy and Marty can withstand anything.

     Ozark Season 4 Part 2 Early Review: A satisfyingly dark conclusion driven by outstanding performances
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ozark Season 4 Part 2Ozark Season 4 Cast: Jason Bateman, Laura Linney, Julia GarnerOzark Creators: Bill Dubuque, Mark WilliamsStreaming Platform: NetflixIf you have been a fan of Ozark, I assume you will admit that it's been one restless journey towards the final season.
The whole appeal of Ozark has been that it shows the deepest, darkest levels at which humans can function when need be.
The last seven episodes of the final season kick off from where we left in January.
After Wyatt and Darlene, there are other characters as well who gets killed off early on in the final season.
Laura Linney continues to put up a brilliant performance season after season and probably the biggest thing that I'm going to miss about Ozark is her performance.
