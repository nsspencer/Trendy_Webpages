    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This was Trevor Bauer from three years ago, over lunch in suburban Cleveland, describing the forces that drove him.
“I want to be a billionaire,” Bauer said, the same way you might order a sandwich.
“Not because I care about the money at all, just because that’s the highest level of achievement in the business world.
I want to win a World Series to do it.
It’s part of what makes me somewhat unhappy a lot in my life, is I don’t celebrate my successes.

     Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer is suspended over sexual assault allegations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer was suspended Friday for two full seasons without pay by Major League Baseball for violating the league's domestic violence and sexual assault policy, which he denies.
"In the strongest possible terms, I deny committing any violation of the league's domestic violence and sexual assault policy," he said Friday in a statement.
The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault.
Bauer was placed on administrative leave last July 2 under the joint domestic violence and sexual assault policy of MLB and the players' association.
"The Dodgers organization takes all allegations of this nature very seriously and does not condone or excuse any acts of domestic violence or sexual assault," the team's statement said.

     MLB Suspends Dodgers Pitcher Trevor Bauer for 324 Games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mark J. Rebilas/USA TODAY SportsEditor’s note: This story contains graphic accounts of domestic violence and sexual assault.

Major League Baseball suspended Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer for 324 games due to violating its domestic violence policy, the league announced Friday.
The Dodgers pitcher has been on administrative leave for allegations of domestic violence and sexual assault since July 2, 2021.

     What we know and don't know about the two-season ban
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The ban -- which covers two full seasons -- is the longest punishment under the sport's domestic violence policy since it was instituted in August of 2015.
Does MLB's 324-game suspension start now or include the time Bauer has already missed?
The domestic violence policy doesn't specify when this hearing needs to take place, and there is no timetable at the moment.
If an independent arbiter upholds MLB's suspension, the Dodgers probably won't have to pay Bauer anything other than what they already have.
How does this compare with other suspensions MLB has given since instituting its domestic violence policy in August 2015?
