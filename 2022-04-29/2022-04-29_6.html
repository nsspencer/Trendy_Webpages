     Summary: Wimbledon champion Boris Becker gets 2 1/2 years in prison for bankruptcy offensesEnlarge this image toggle caption Alastair Grant/AP Alastair Grant/APLONDON — Tennis great Boris Becker was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison on Friday for illicitly transferring large amounts of money and hiding assets after he was declared bankrupt.
The three-time Wimbledon champion was convicted earlier this month on four charges under the Insolvency Act and had faced a maximum sentence of seven years in prison.
The jury at Southwark Crown Court in London acquitted him on 20 other counts, including charges that he failed to hand over his many awards, including two Wimbledon trophies and an Olympic gold medal.
Becker, wearing a striped tie in Wimbledon's purple and green colors, walked into the courthouse hand in hand with girlfriend Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro.
The six-time Grand Slam champion has denied all the charges, saying he had cooperated with trustees tasked with securing his assets — even offering up his wedding ring — and had acted on expert advice.

     Former tennis great Boris Becker jailed for hiding assets in U.K. bankruptcy case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON — German tennis great Boris Becker was jailed by a London court on Friday for hiding hundreds of thousands of pounds of assets after he was declared bankrupt.
Becker was convicted earlier this month of four charges under Britain’s Insolvency Act, including failing to disclose, concealing and removing significant assets following a bankruptcy trial.
The 54-year-old six-time Grand Slam champion was found guilty of transferring money to his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely after his 2017 bankruptcy.
“There has been no humility.”She said Becker would serve half his sentence behind bars and the remainder on probation.
Becker, whose partner Lillian and son Noah were in court, looked straight ahead as the sentence was handed down.

     Boris Becker sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail over bankruptcy charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Six-time grand slam champion Boris Becker was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail on Friday for flouting the terms of his bankruptcy in 2017, according to the UK's Insolvency Service.
During the sentencing at London's Southwark Crown Court, Becker, supported by partner Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro, wore a grey suit, white shirt and a striped tie in the Wimbledon colors of green and purple.
"You have not shown remorse, acceptance of your guilt and have sought to distance yourself from your offending and your bankruptcy.
"Today's verdict confirms that Boris Becker failed to comply with his legal obligation to declare significant assets in his bankruptcy," said Dean Beale, chief executive of the Insolvency Service.
He has remained active in the tennis world since retiring from the sport, notably as the coach of Novak Djokovic and through frequent media appearances as a commentator and pundit.

Judge Deborah Taylor announced the sentence after hearing arguments from both the prosecutor and Becker’s attorney.
