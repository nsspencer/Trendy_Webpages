     What the Vikings can expect from new safety Lewis Cine in 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Vikings selected Lewis Cine in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft.
After trading down from the 12th overall pick, the Minnesota Vikings landed Georgia safety Lewis Cine with the 32nd overall pick on Thursday night.
The trade also gives the Vikings the second pick of the second round on Friday night which could be a huge trade slot once again.
Lewis Cine was one of the leaders of the Georgia defense that dominated the SEC last season as they charged toward a National Championship.
Grabbing a player like Lewis Cine with the 32nd pick is great value and fills an immediate need for their defense.

     Summary: "We really looked at is as, 'Hey, what is your outcome if you don't do this trade versus what is your outcome if you stay and pick?'
But also, 'Hey, they have to play the Minnesota Vikings and all the players we're going to get.'
There's also the possibility that they have backups [as trade partners], right?
So if we don't do the trade, there are odds they can do a trade anyway.
You're always kind of factoring in many things that could happen.

     Vikings enter Friday's second round near front of the line, and with more needs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After trading back 20 spots in Thursday night's first round, the Vikings won't have to wait long to be on the clock Friday night.
The Vikings hold the second pick – 34th overall – in the second round, which general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah could take in multiple directions with needs remaining at cornerback, defensive line and receiver, among others, and other NFL teams potentially looking to trade up.
Adofo-Mensah referenced a "curveball" in getting a late trade offer for the 32nd overall pick on Thursday night, when they ultimately selected Georgia safety Lewis Cine.
The Vikings addressed the secondary by drafting Cine at the end of the first round, with Adofo-Mensah citing his "special" range in coverage.
Two prospects discussed as possible first-round options, Clemson's Andrew Booth Jr. and Washington's Kyler Gordon, didn't hear their names called and may be worth a swing at the top of the second round.
