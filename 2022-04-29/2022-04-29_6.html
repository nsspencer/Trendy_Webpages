     Clemson wide receiver Justyn Ross goes unpicked in NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was an unexpected drop for Clemson wide receiver Justyn Ross.
Ross, who was seen as likely choice in the top three rounds of seven in the NFL Draft, went unpicked Saturday and was left to find a free agent deal somewhere.
Teams might not be convinced that Ross is fully past a medical condition that sidelined him for an entire year.
As a freshman in 2018, Ross led the ACC and ranked fifth nationally in yards per catch, second in receiving touchdowns and fifth in yards.

     Former first-round prospect Justyn Ross goes undrafted, hopes for one chance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesClemson wide receiver Justyn Ross would have been a first-round draft pick in 2019, if the NFL would allow freshmen to declare for the draft.
But Ross couldn‚Äôt turn pro, and after returning to Clemson he suffered a stinger in practice that revealed a potentially serious congenital spinal condition that caused him to miss one full season.
Ross went undrafted over the weekend, and now he‚Äôs just hoping that some team gives him a shot as an undrafted free agent.
‚ÄúJust need dat 1 chance,‚Äù Ross wrote on Twitter.
It had to be a rough weekend for Ross, especially knowing that if not for the NFL‚Äôs draft rules forcing him to remain in school, he could have been a first-round pick who‚Äôs now heading into his fourth NFL season.

The 2022 NFL Draft was no different, as plenty of players experienced said slide.

     Former Clemson Tiger Justyn Ross Not Selected In NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NFL Draft has come and gone with former Clemson wideout Justyn Ross never hearing his name called.
The last time Clemson had just two players selected in the draft was in 2008, when Tommy Bowden was the head coach in the 2008 NFL Draft.
In 2019, Ross hauled in a team-high 66 catches for 865 yards and nine touchdowns, earning All-ACC honorable mention honors.
Although, despite leading the team in catches (46) and receiving yards (514), Ross never looked like quite the same player.
Maybe there is a team out there willing to take a shot on the talented receiver as an undrafted free agent, maybe not, but this certainly isn't how Ross' Clemson career was expected to end.
