     Michigan Football: Breaking down Daxton Hill to Bengals at No. 31
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Michigan football safety Daxton Hill was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals, he was taken in the first round but not as high as you might think.
The Bengals selected Daxton Hill with the 31st pick in the first round, and he will fit in nicely with a nice young team in Cincinnati.
Hill was a rock this past year for Michigan football, and as we know, he can make plays in the backend.
I think I speak for all Michigan football fans when I say thank you to Daxton Hill; he has been remarkable and a key player for the Wolverines these past three years.
Hill came to Michigan with a lot of hype as 5-stars do, but he surpassed that and more.

     Summary: “One of the steals of the draft so far,” ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. said after the Cincinnati Bengals drafted former Michigan safety Daxton Hill with the 31st pick in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft on Thursday night.
13 prospect on his most recent draft rankings after an impressive NFL Combine in which Hill ran a 4.38 40, one of the fastest time for a safety in years.
Hill played mostly as a slot cornerback for the Wolverines last year.
“Let’s start with the instincts and the eyes, being able to get your eyes on the quarterback,” said NFL Network draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah.

     Summary: 31 and the player joining the reigning AFC champions is Daxton Hill out of Michigan.
With all of this in mind, what grade do the Bengals deserve for their selection of Daxton Hill in the first round?
They stick and take Daxton Hill, DB, Michigan.
The Bengals need good tacklers and Hill is just that, notching 69 total tackles for the Wolverines during a 14-game stint in 2021.
I’ll give the Daxton Hill pick a B+.

     Dehner Jr.: Daxton Hill checks off themes of the weekend for Bengals and what his arrival means for Jessie Bates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bengals wasted no time asserting what figures to be their themes of the weekend: Versatility, defense, culture.
There were two obvious targets at premium positions of need when the Bengals went on the clock at 31: CB Andrew Booth, of Clemson, and Hill.
The nod went to Hill, who played safety and nickel at a high level for the Wolverines.
“We feel that way — the more the player can do, the better off he’ll help us as a team,” Anarumo said.
Hill will serve as the immediate backup this year for Jessie Bates, Vonn Bell and Mike Hilton.
