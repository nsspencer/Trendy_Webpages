     Google Doodle celebrates the anniversary of Route 66’s creation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The most recent Google Doodle commemorates the 50th anniversary of the establishment of Route 66, the iconic roadway that extended from Chicago to Los Angeles and is considered a historical landmark in American automobile culture.
The Lone Star Route, Ozark Trails, and National Old Trails Road were grafted together on April 30, 1926, to become US Route 66, which runs 2,448 miles from Chicago to Los Angeles.
Before arriving in California, Route 66 passed through Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona before being entirely paved in 1938.
Matthew Cruickshank, the Googler behind today’s Doodle, drove the full 2,448-mile stretch of Route 66 to commemorate its heritage.
He sketched and painted over 100 different pieces along the road, all of which have been brought to life in today’s Google Doodle, which is set to the popular song “(Get Your Kicks On) Route 66.”

     What is Route 66?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ROUTE 66 has become an icon in American popular culture as a road symbolic of adventure and freedom.
2 Route 66 stretches over 2,000 miles from Chicago to CaliforniaWhat is Route 66?
Also known as US Route 66 or US Highway 66, it was one of America's the first national highways for motor vehicles and has since become a cultural icon.
But, after the Route gained its status as a tourist attraction, the Route 66 Association decided to mount the "End of the Trail" sign at Santa Monica Pier.
Online advice recommends that driving Route 66 will take around two or three weeks, depending on frequency and length of stops.

     Google Video Doodle Lets You Get Your Kicks on Route 66
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For many Americans, Route 66 holds a special place in their heart, evoking memories of days gone by.
Its position as Main Street of America was cemented by the hit 1946 song (Get Your Kicks on) Route 66, as well as in the '60s TV show Route 66.
Although Route 66 was retired as a US highway in 1985, more than 85% of the original 2,448-mile highway is still drivable, giving thousands of tourists each year the chance to take their own trip back in time.
One of those tourists was Google Doodle artist Matthew Cruickshank, who made the journey west in his 1972 Chevy Chevelle.
A video Doodle, released Friday, is his creation, essentially an animated sketchbook of the various historic sites he encountered along the way.

     Google Doodle celebrates Route 66, a touchstone of American car culture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The latest Google Doodle celebrates the anniversary of the creation of Route 66, the famous highway that ran from Chicago to Los Angeles and serves as a historical touchstone in American car culture.
Route 66 — which wouldn’t be fully paved until 1938 — coursed through Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona before arriving in California.
The 1950s steadily wore away at the charm and necessity of Route 66, most notably with the beginnings of the US Interstate System.
Ultimately, Route 66 was decommissioned from the US Highway System in 1985, but the mark it left on American culture drives on.
To celebrate the history of Route 66, the Googler responsible for today’s Doodle, Matthew Cruickshank, drove the entire 2,448-mile stretch of Route 66.

     Summary: Why is Google Celebrating Route 66?
What is ‘Historic’ Route 66?
Technically, Route 66 no longer exists today.
Parts of Route 66 in Illinois, Missouri, New Mexico, and Arizona have been classified as a National Scenic Byway, with the name ’Historic Route 66’ reinstated on some maps, and many original establishments from the historic highway's heyday can still be found today.
Several states have also incorporated substantial bypassed sections of the former US 66 as State Route 66 into their state road networks.
