     Summary: 31 and the player joining the reigning AFC champions is Daxton Hill out of Michigan.
With all of this in mind, what grade do the Bengals deserve for their selection of Daxton Hill in the first round?
They stick and take Daxton Hill, DB, Michigan.
The Bengals need good tacklers and Hill is just that, notching 69 total tackles for the Wolverines during a 14-game stint in 2021.
I‚Äôll give the Daxton Hill pick a B+.
