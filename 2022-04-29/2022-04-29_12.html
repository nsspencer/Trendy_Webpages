Manage cookie settingsThis new Modern Warfare 2 is the fifth major game in COD's Modern Warfare subseries.
It's also a sequel to 2019's Modern Warfare reboot - which at least had the decency to have a slightly different name to the 2007 Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare original.

     Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is happening — along with new Warzone experience
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Infinity Ward revealed a first look at Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, a sequel to 2019's Modern Warfare that's set to release in late 2022.
As previously announced, Call of Duty 2022 will be a continuation of the revamped Modern Warfare, and it will also come with a new Warzone experience.
And, despite already introducing a new engine in Modern Warfare 2019 with ray tracing and detailed environments, this year's Call of Duty and Warzone will be powered by an all-new engine.
This is the team behind the popular Modern Warfare installments, along with the hugely successful Warzone.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has some big shoes to fill, especially after the big reception the original received in 2009.

     Summary: Infinity Ward has finally revealed the first official logo for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.
Continuing the odd naming convention that takes past relesaes wholesale, Infinity Ward has confirmed that it's working on a sequel to 2019's Modern Warfare reboot (not a remake of 2009's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2).

This game could also mark the end of the yearly Call of Duty release – something we've seen in some for or another since 2005.
This would give the studios tied to the series – Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, Treyarch and Raven – some room to breathe and commit to longer development cycles.

     New Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Proves It's Getting Confusing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So it’s no surprise that we are getting another Call of Duty Modern Warfare, this one a sequel to the 2019 MW reboot.
However, did you know that this is actually the 10th Modern Warfare game and the fourth one to end in a 2?
Some of these are mobile ports or handheld spin-offs, but they all officially shipped with “Modern Warfare” slapped on the front of the box, so in my book they count:Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Modern Warfare 2 Modern Warfare 3 Modern Warfare Reflex Edition Modern Warfare Mobilized Modern Warfare Remastered Modern Warfare 2 Remastered Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2: Force Recon Modern Warfare (2019 Reboot) Modern Warfare II (Reboot Sequel)Let’s try to clear this up.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is the sequel to Modern Warfare (2019), which was a reboot of Modern Warfare, and is not related to Modern Warfare Remastered or Modern Warfare 2 Remastered, both of which are part of the same sub-series within Call of Duty that includes Modern Warfare 2: Force Recon and Modern Warfare Mobilized, which is a DS port of Modern Warfare 2, but not the remastered edition but instead the original, which is not the new game just announced, which is a sequel to the rebooted Modern Warfare.
Regardless, Modern Warfare II (Not Modern Warfare 2) will be out later this year across the usual platforms, I assume.

It's also been suggested a remastered multiplayer mode for the original 2009 Modern Warfare 2 will launch as part of the 2022 Modern Warfare 2, just to keep things nice and confusing.
In the same way 2019's Modern Warfare remastered classic maps and weapons from the original Modern Warfare, expect the likes of Rust and Terminal to end up in the 2022 shooter.
