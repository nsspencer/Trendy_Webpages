     Summary: After selecting Kyler Gordon 39th overall and Jaquan Brisker 48th overall, the Chicago Bears make a splash at [position] by selecting Velus Jones 71st overall in the 2022 NFL Draft.
If there’s one thing Velus Jones brings to the table, it’s speed.
Jones player is a fast, physical, and not-that-small receiver considering his speed and twitch.
Along with those attributes he brings to the table, Velus Jones was a rather impactful player at Tennessee.
There’s a lot that goes into evaluating players, and in this instance, I think it’s safe to say the Bears got a good player in Velus Jones Jr. at the 71st overall selection in the 2022 NFL Draft.
