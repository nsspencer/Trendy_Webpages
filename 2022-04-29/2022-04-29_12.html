     What is Rivian and why did it drag down Amazon and Ford earnings?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Both Amazon and Ford reported quarterly earnings losses this week, citing their investments in Rivian Automotive.
Amazon on Thursday reported a rare quarterly loss of $3.84 billion, owing entirely to a $7.6 billion loss in value of its stock investment in Rivian Automotive.
Rivian Automotive is an electric truck manufacturer that owns a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois.
Shareholders – and, indirectly, investors in Ford and Amazon – can't expect a quick turnaround.
Amid all the economic headwinds, Rivian stock continues to fall, closing Thursday at $32.18.

     Summary: Amazon has a $10 billion stake in Rivian, a startup making electric trucks.
As Tesla CEO Elon Musk famously said, “those who have not been involved in manufacturing just have no idea how painful and difficult it is.
But Rivian is currently focusing on manufacturing its electric pickup truck, the R1T.
A bumpy road for Amazon’s Rivian investmentIronically, just three months earlier, Rivian added a $12 billion profit to Amazon’s fourth-quarter bottom line, thanks to its then soaring stock.
Almost every publicly traded electric carmaker, with the exception of Tesla, have seen their share prices tumble amid sluggish market conditions.

     Amazon joins Ford in reporting significant losses from Rivian investment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

Amazon reported during its Earnings Call on Thursday that it lost $7.6 billion on its Rivian investment.

“We have incurred net losses since our inception, including net losses of $0.4 billion, $1.0 billion, and $4.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively,” Rivian said in the filing.

     Here's Why Rivian Stock Is Sinking This Week and Could Fall Further
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The company's share price was down roughly 4.3% from last week's close ahead of Friday's market open, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.
The electric vehicle (EV) company's share price also took a hit this week following downward stock-price target revisions from analysts.
Lately, the EV specialist is making the news because big declines for its share price have led to big losses showing up in the earnings reports of the aforementioned backers.
That's still a highly growth-dependent valuation, and it puts the stock at risk for more pullbacks if investor appetite for risk continues to wane.
With the market reacting negatively to Amazon's recent earnings report and plenty of other risk factors to consider, Rivian stock could see more bumpy trading in the near term.

     Summary: Earlier this week, Ford reported an overall $3.1 billion loss for the first quarter, due to its mark-to-market loss of $5.4 billion on its Rivian investment.
The future of these investments in Rivian by Ford and Amazon is an open question.
That, combined with Ford's definitive "no comment" on Rivian raises the question whether Ford's Rivian investment might change in some manner.
This October 13, 2021 photo shows a Rivian electric truck at the Blue Origin Launch Site One in the West Texas region, 25 miles (40kms) north of Van Horn.
Regardless of what Amazon and Ford do, Rivian has a lot of work to do.

     Summary: This is a given for the companies (Ford and Rivian) that are the subject of this article.
Ford and exit from ICEWhile Ford has taken steps to silo its BEV and ICE activities, how they will deal with the ICE business (Ford Blue) continues to evolve.
Here I've focused on Ford and Rivian and these companies offer very different investment theses.
The point is that the Rivian stock price is down 68% in less than six months from listing.
Both companies look to become significant participants in a process that could foreshadow replacing 1.4 billion ICE vehicles with electrified emissions-free solutions.
