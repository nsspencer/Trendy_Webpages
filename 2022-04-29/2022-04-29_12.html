Manage cookie settingsThis new Modern Warfare 2 is the fifth major game in COD's Modern Warfare subseries.
It's also a sequel to 2019's Modern Warfare reboot - which at least had the decency to have a slightly different name to the 2007 Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare original.

     Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is happening — along with new Warzone experience
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Infinity Ward revealed a first look at Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, a sequel to 2019's Modern Warfare that's set to release in late 2022.
As previously announced, Call of Duty 2022 will be a continuation of the revamped Modern Warfare, and it will also come with a new Warzone experience.
And, despite already introducing a new engine in Modern Warfare 2019 with ray tracing and detailed environments, this year's Call of Duty and Warzone will be powered by an all-new engine.
This is the team behind the popular Modern Warfare installments, along with the hugely successful Warzone.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has some big shoes to fill, especially after the big reception the original received in 2009.

     Summary: Infinity Ward has finally revealed the first official logo for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.
Continuing the odd naming convention that takes past relesaes wholesale, Infinity Ward has confirmed that it's working on a sequel to 2019's Modern Warfare reboot (not a remake of 2009's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2).

This game could also mark the end of the yearly Call of Duty release – something we've seen in some for or another since 2005.
This would give the studios tied to the series – Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, Treyarch and Raven – some room to breathe and commit to longer development cycles.

     Modern Warfare 2 Reveal Is Full Of Easter Eggs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Don't tell Call of Duty, but we kinda knew about Modern Warfare 2 this whole time.
AdvertisementLeaks and rumours pointed towards a sequel to 2019's Modern Warfare since even before Vanguard, and the revelation of the upcoming Warzone 2 came with the reveal that the sequel was on the way anyway.
But in a move of a "pretend you didn't know this" energy, Call of Duty has revealed the logo for Modern Warfare 2 in incredibly dramatic fashion.
AdvertisementBut, the logo reveal might have been revealing more than we had expected.
Modern Warfare 2's Logo Reveal Is Rife With Easter EggsThough on the surface, the video revealed across the Call of Duty social media channels might just look like the reveal of a predictable logo, it seems there's a lot that's waiting under the surface.
