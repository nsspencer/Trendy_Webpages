     Remembering Neal Adams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DC joins the world in mourning the loss of Neal Adams, one of the most acclaimed artists to have contributed to the comic book industry.
DC Publisher and Chief Creative Officer Jim Lee, who has drawn quite a few Batman stories of his own, said, “Neal Adams was an amazing illustrator, he changed comics.
In 1967, Neal came to DC Comics, where he drew covers for war comics and contributed stories to The Adventures of Jerry Lewis and The Adventures of Bob Hope.
The artist showed a natural affinity for the Dark Knight, and in 1970, DC editor Julius Schwartz assigned the Batman comics to Neal and writer Dennis O’Neil.
With deep respect for Neal and his tireless work and great love for the comics industry, we extend our condolences to his family and friends.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But his eye apparently never strayed far from the first company he’d ever reportedly applied to work for: DC Comics.
In the meantime, Adams picked up his first serious fan attention for his work on a less well-known hero, Deadman.
Adams, never politically shy, used also used his growing reputation to disrupt systems inside the comics industry that put much of the power in the hands of publishers.
But he remained, and remains, one of the gods of 20th century comics; an artist who didn’t just define the look of superhero comics, but also pushed back on assumptions of how the industry itself could, or should, run.
DC Comics penned a tribute to Adams earlier today, writing, “ With deep respect for Neal and his tireless work and great love for the comics industry, we extend our condolences to his family and friends.”
