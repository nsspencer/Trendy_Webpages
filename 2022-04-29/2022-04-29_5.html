     Bears draft Kyler Gordon, cornerback with first pick of 2022 draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 39 pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, the Bears selected Kyler Gordon, a cornerback out of Washington.
Gordon has experience playing on the outside and in the slot, so he provides versatility for the team as Matt Eberflus works to rebuild the defense.
Gordon also has experience playing in zone defenses like Eberflus’ and does a good job of keeping the play in front of him in those situations.
Last season, Gordon surrendered only a 50% completion rate and a 47.3 passer rating, according to PFF.
48, then again at 71, but there’s a chance Poles opts to trade down from one of those spots to add more draft capital.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft kicked off on Friday night, it was all about a few key positions of need for the Chicago Bears.
39 overall, the Chicago Bears solidified their cornerback position by selecting Washington cornerback Kyler Gordon.
If this cornerback room is healthy, then the Chicago Bears completely renovated that position with a matter of two particular players.
Kyler Gordon immediately makes the Chicago Bears’ cornerback room one to reckon with.
The Chicago Bears got someone who will be able to read the quarterback in a hurry, but make a move immediately once he understands where the ball is going.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brisker began his college career at Lackawanna College in Scranton, Penn., playing there in 2017-18.
He was selected with a draft pick acquired last month as part of a trade that sent outside linebacker Khalil Mack to the Los Angeles Chargers.
Brisker continued to pick up elements of the defensive scheme and his play has steadily transformed from hesitant in 2019 to downright instinctive in 2021.
He played with a banged-up shoulder in 2021 so his 2020 tape is a clearer indicator of his run support acumen.
Brisker is an ascending talent with the NFL traits to become a long-time starter as a Day 2 draft pick."

If there’s one thing Velus Jones brings to the table, it’s speed.
Jones player is a fast, physical, and not-that-small receiver considering his speed and twitch.
Along with those attributes he brings to the table, Velus Jones was a rather impactful player at Tennessee.
There’s a lot that goes into evaluating players, and in this instance, I think it’s safe to say the Bears got a good player in Velus Jones Jr. at the 71st overall selection in the 2022 NFL Draft.
