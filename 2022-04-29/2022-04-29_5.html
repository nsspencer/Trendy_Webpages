     Summary: He played on the best defense in the entire country last season at Georgia and was arguably its best player.
He finished with the second-most tackles (72), second-most sacks (6), most tackles for a loss (10.5), and third-most interceptions (2) on the team.
Don’t forget this team already has Roquan Smith on the roster, a Pro Bowler in all but name.
Adding a talent like Dean alongside him threatens to create the best combination this team has seen since Brian Urlacher and Lance Briggs.
This is another case of teams overlooking evident football ability just because a guy doesn’t precisely fit the ideal measurables.
