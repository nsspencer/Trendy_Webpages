     Summary: With the 32nd overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, the Minnesota Vikings have selected Georgia safety Lewis Cine.
At 6-foot-1, 200 pounds, Cine is a "long safety who plays in cover two, single high and man against tight ends," according NFL.com analyst Daniel Jeremiah.
His physical traits breed confidence that Cine could translate into a single high safety in the NFL.
The athletic ability cannot be questioned about Lewis and will allow him to play in a lot of man-to-man coverage as a box safety.
But what makes Cine stand out in the opinion of SI Dawgs Daily's Brooks Austin is his play as a box safety.
