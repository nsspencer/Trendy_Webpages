     Summary: Celebrating arbor day, what community members can do to care for their treesDELMARVA – Local agriculture and tree experts are sharing their thoughts on National Arbor Day, and how you can help both plant and maintain trees around you.
According to Delmarva arborist, Lou Meyer, the day is about more than just celebrating trees.
Meyers says trees add so much to our lives that it’s easy to take them for granted.
Trees produce oxygen, clean the air, put water into the air, create wildlife habitats, and so much more.
Dr. Stotts says basic pruning and educating yourself about fertilizer are great ways to help your trees thrive.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yes, Arbor Day, the holiday dedicated to celebrating trees, began in the flat—and often treeless—prairie stretch of southern Nebraska.
There’s an old saying that you don’t plant trees for yourself, you plant trees for 20 years from now.”So Morton, a silver-tongued newspaper man, put pen to paper.
In the northwest corner of Nebraska City, the Arbor Day Farm sprawls out over 260 acres.
Each year, school kids are given trees to take home for Arbor Day to plant with their families.
For places like Nebraska City, trees don’t just happen.

     Manatee County highlights Median Plantings on Arbor Day 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manatee County highlights Median Plantings on Arbor Day 2022MANATEE COUNTY, FL (April 29, 2022) – On National Arbor Day 2022, Manatee County is “taking it to the streets” to show off a unique way to help soften urban hardscapes by planting shrubs, plants and trees in medians between traffic lanes.Along a typically busy 53rd Avenue West (SR70) at 36th Street West, County Commission Chair Kevin Van Ostenbridge praised the work of the County’s Property Management Department, whose landscape team members have installed nearly 5000 plants, and planted between 150 and 200 trees in dozens of medians across the county.“Right away, they shared the vision and jumped right on top of it, said the District Three Commissioner.
“It has been a huge success.”Speakers from the Florida Forest Service and the Manatee County Environmental Lands Management and Acquisition Committee (ELMAC) extolled the virtues of these median plantings, noting that each tree can help scrub about 50 pounds of carbon out of the air… right at the source.
They also noted that Manatee County has been named a Tree City USA community fort the 13th straight year.The median beautification program is being rolled out in various locations around the county.
Residents can expect to see more of the beautification projects coming soon… to a median near them.
brief video of the Arbor Day 2022 ceremony and comments from those on hand can be found on the County YouTube Channel.
