     Summary: Scientists have taken the first step to creating the next generation of wearable health monitors.
A new study suggests that a wearable sensor may be able to monitor the body's health by detecting the gases released from a person's skin.
Gouma also leads the Smart Connected Health project, which aims to support research in health and medicine.
advertisementBut such a gadget requires "active intent" and only provides a "momentary snapshot" of the body, Annerino noted.
"Not every research study has an obvious impact on society and people's lives, but that's something that this project in particular really has," he said.
