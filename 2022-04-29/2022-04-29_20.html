     Former Idaho lawmaker found guilty of raping teenage intern, reports say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. --- A former Idaho lawmaker was convicted Friday of raping a teenage intern, following a trial during which the victim walked out of the courtroom in the middle of testimony, according to multiple media reports.
Aaron von Ehlinger, 39, was found guilty of raping a 19-year-old legislative intern at his apartment after eating dinner with her at a Boise restaurant last March, the Associated Press reported.
The victim apparently told a Statehouse supervisor she and von Ehlinger had gone out to dinner, then returned to her apartment where she was raped.
He told the jury that he asked the intern to “hang out” following their dinner and said they began making out on the couch, the Associated Press reported.
“Things were going well, and I asked if she would like to move to the bedroom,” he told the media outlet.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 30 (UPI) -- An Idaho jury has found former state Rep. Aaron von Ehlinger guilty of raping a legislative intern last year.
The jury came to its decision after 11 hours of deliberation, also finding von Ehlinger, 39, not guilty of a separate charge of forcible penetration, KTVB-TV in Boise, Idaho, reported.
Von Ehlinger denied the accusations, saying the two had a consensual relationship.
Von Ehlinger, who was taken into custody after the verdict was read Friday, faces up to life in prison during his sentencing July 28.
Von Ehlinger resigned from the Idaho House last year after the legislative ethics committee voted to remove him from his seat.

     Summary: Former Idaho state Rep. Aaron von Ehlinger looks toward a gallery during his rape trial in Idaho's Ada County on Wednesday.
CNN —A former Idaho state lawmaker was found guilty Friday of raping a state legislative intern in 2021.
Von Ehlinger resigned in April 2021 after a state House committee heard the intern’s allegations and unanimously recommended that von Ehlinger be censured and stripped of the powers of his office without pay.
Jon Cox, an attorney for von Ehlinger, did not comment on the case when approached by KIVI.
Von Ehlinger first took office in June 2020, when Idaho’s governor appointed him to fill a vacancy in the state House.

     Idaho Republican’s rape conviction a rare victory for sexual assault victims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The rape conviction of the Republican Idaho lawmaker Aaron von Ehlinger on Friday was a rare victory for prosecutors in a criminal justice system that can be fraught for victims of sexual assault, experts said.
When a legislative intern accused von Ehlinger of rape last year, she was subjected to online harassment and abuse.
Doe was 19 and interning at the Idaho statehouse when she met Von Ehlinger and agreed to go to dinner.
A sexual assault examination revealed DNA that matched von Ehlinger.
Successful prosecutions can help the public better understand the dynamics of power and control in sexual assault cases, Jeglic said.
