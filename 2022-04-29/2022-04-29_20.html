     Donald Trump declares ‘I’M BACK! #COVFEFE’ as he returns to social media
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ex-President Donald Trump posted on social media for the first time in more than a year (Pictures: AP/Reuters/Truth Social)Former President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform for the first time officially, announcing he is back on social media and sharing a hashtag of his infamous 2017 typo.
It was not clear exactly why Trump used #covfefe in his Truth Social post, but the term again caught the attention of his fans and critics alike.
Trump’s social media post on Thursday was his first in more than a year.
About a week before Truth Social launched, the ex-president’s eldest son Donald Trump Jr tweeted a screenshot of what he said was his father’s first post.
‘I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,’ Trump told Fox News on Monday.

     Trump's Appearance on Truth Social Reminds Us 'Truths' Is a Perfect Name for These Un-Tweets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Donald Trump has ascended triumphantly to his own social-media platform, Truth Social, billed as an alternative to Twitter where free speech can frolic in the idyllic meadows of liberty and justice.
Anyway, the former president posted a "Truth" on Thursday—it's like a tweet, but True—and in fairness, it fuckin' slaps:Indeed.
Not "Truth Social," really, but the term "Truths" for the messages people post on this thing.
For a long time now, the truth has been whatever you can get enough people to believe.
Elon agrees, though surely he knows there's a reason this is the one thing Trump didn't plaster his name on.

     Analysis: A brief history of 'covfefe'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: #COVFEFE," Trump tweeted truthed , with a picture of himself at his Mar-a-Lago estate.
Mostly because of his use of the made-up word "covfefe."
It all began in back in May 2017 when, a little after midnight, then-President Trump tweeted this : "Despite the constant negative press covfefe."
Trump meant to type "coverage" -- as in "constant negative press COVERAGE" -- but instead wrote "covfefe" and hit send on his tweet before spell-checking it.
The White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, was subsequently asked what Trump meant by "covfefe."
