    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stop what you’re doing and wish living Texas legend Willie Nelson a happy birthday.
Although he retired in the early '70s, settling in Austin, Nelson grew restless and reemerged in the music business.
As a nod to his birthday, his record label, Legacy Recordings, has released his new studio album “A Beautiful Time” on vinyl.
The program will air on Nelson’s SiriusXM channel Willie’s Roadhouse at 8 p.m. EST for the three-day birthday celebration.
Also, don’t forget Willie Nelson’s 4th of July Picnic and Fireworks, convening at the new Q2 Stadium, home of Major League Soccer’s Austin FC, at 11 a.m. on July 4.

     Willie Nelson celebrates his birthday twice: Here’s why
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AUSTIN (KXAN) — Willie Nelson is celebrating his 89th birthday today — and also tomorrow.
But as he’s explained in the past, he observes his birthday on the 30th, too.
Nelson released two albums in 2021 (in February and November), and one of them — “That’s Life,” his tribute to Frank Sinatra — was nominated for a 2022 Grammy Award.
The event marks only the second time Strait and Nelson have shared a stage in their careers.
“I’m so glad I’ll get to ‘sing one with Willie,’ and I can’t think of a better place to do it than Austin, Texas,” Strait said in a release at the time of the announcement.

     Summary: Then followed a period of venerable celebration: Willie Nelson was awash in living legend status as a musician who has cut a distinctive path for decades.
WILLIE NELSON: 81 OF HIS GREATEST SONGSNelson has written and recorded so many enduring songs, trying to put them into ordered form is a fool’s errand.
“I Still Can’t Believe You’re Gone”: The version on “Phases and Stages” (my single favorite Nelson album), remains definitive.
“I Was Just Walkin’ Out the Door”: One of the benefits of being Willie Nelson, nobody tells you what to do.
That’s what Willie Nelson does, right?
