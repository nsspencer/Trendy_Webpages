     Ole Miss Rebels Selected in Sports Illustrated's Day Two Mock Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam WilliamsIn a new Sports Illustrated mock draft, Kevin Hanson predicts how the next two rounds will unfold tonight and included Corral and Williams.
Let's take a look and see what teams could take a chance on Corral and Williams in rounds two and three of the draft:40.
Seattle Seahawks (via Broncos): Matt Corral, QB, Mississippi In an earlier iteration of my mock, I thought it would have made sense if the Seahawks had traded up to No.
Seattle would not be the worst destination for Corral, as he would get to reunite with former Ole Miss receiver DK Metcalf, one of the most electric wideouts in the NFL.
Cowboys: Sam Williams, edge, Mississippi48 picks later, the top edge rusher on the 2021 Ole Miss defense is selected by the Dallas Cowboys.

     NFL Draft | Which team will pick Ole Miss quarterback Matt Corral tonight?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Quarterback Matt CorralMatt Corral was disappointed that he did not hear his name called in Thursday night's first round of the NFL Draft.
So which team may take a flyer on the former Ole Miss Rebel?
Ole Miss fans would certainly love Corral following in legendary rebel Archie Manning's footsteps to the Big Easy.
The Saints draft tonight with the 49th overall pick.
They may have lost a few Ole Miss fans Thursday night when they traded ex-Rebel AJ Brown to Philadelphia, and they could gain most of them back if they pick Corral.
