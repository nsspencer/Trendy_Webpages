     Report: Eagles sign undrafted free agent Nevada QB Carson Strong
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Undrafted Nevada quarterback Carson Strong has signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, according to a report from Kristen Moran of Nevada Sports Net.
Prior to the start of fall camp this month, Strong has an arthroscopy to clear out scar tissue in the knee.
Strong was a full participant in Nevada's first fall camp practice Aug. 6, although his knee was bleeding heavily after the session.
Strong has since had to have the knee drained a couple of times and has been limited to watching practice from a golf cart in recent sessions.

     Eagles sign Carson Strong as UDFA, quarterback expected to compete for spot on depth chart
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia Eagles went through the 2022 NFL Draft without selecting a quarterback.
Philadelphia signed Nevada quarterback Carson Strong as an undrafted free agent, per Nevada SportsNet.
Strong was one of the top passers in the FBS over the last three seasons, ranking first in completions (852), fourth in pass yards (9,368), and second in pass touchdowns (74).
Strong was seventh in the FBS in completion rate (70%), fifth in pass yards per game (347.9), and tied for seventh in pass touchdowns (36) in 2021.
In a lackluster quarterback class where just one quarterback went in the first 73 picks, Strong went undrafted due to a history of knee issues.

     Eagles reportedly signing UDFA quarterback Carson Strong
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They are signing former Nevada quarterback Carson Strong, according to Kirsten Moran of Nevada SportsNet.
In 2021, Strong put up big numbers, throwing for 4,175 yards with 36 touchdowns and just 8 interceptions.
But the real reason for the slide is likely his long history of injuries to his right knee dating back to high school.
After the 2020 season, however, he underwent surgery to clean up cartilage in the same knee with which he had issues in high school.
With that said, Strong does have the desired quarterback frame and a big arm with the ability to fire passes deep and into tight windows.

     Why did Carson Strong go undrafted? Long-term health issue likely hurt newest Eagles QB
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carson Strong was widely considered to be a top-six quarterback in the 2022 NFL Draft.
BENDER: Ravens, Chiefs, Jets headline winners of 2022 NFL DraftWhy did Carson Strong go undrafted?
It appears that Strong went undrafted because of worries about a knee injury that he has dealt with since he was in high school.
He needed another knee surgery while in college and wore a knee brace throughout his time with the Wolf Pack.
Strong was able to work out without the brace, but NFL teams likely were still leery of the injury.

     Eagles sign Nevada QB Carson Strong to an undrafted free agent deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: JUST IN: Quarterback Carson Strong has signed with the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent — Kirsten Moran (@kirstenlizmoran) April 30, 2022The Eagles add a quarterback to the roster anytime potential is noticed and after going undrafted, former Nevada star Carson Strong is signing an undrafted free agent deal with Philadelphia.
Strong previously met with the Eagles at the Senior Bowl and he offers a big-time throwing arm with solid intangibles.
Strong fits the mold when it comes to quarterbacks, standing 6’4 215 pounds, the former Nevada signal-caller has the best arm in the draft, he’s among the most accurate passers in the draft, can throw his wide receivers open, while also making sound decisions in the passing game.
Strong threw for 4,175 yards and 36 touchdowns in 2021 and definitely could have a future down the line as a development quarterback.
