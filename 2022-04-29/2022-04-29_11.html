     Vikings move way down in 1st round, take Georgia safety Cine - Austin Daily Herald
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Georgia safety Lewis Cine was the result, bringing the potential reward of a hard-hitting, sure-tackling, well-respected player from a dominant defense on the most recent national champions.
The catch from the 20-spot slide in the first round for the Vikings was an early third-rounder and a 12-spot jump in the second round.
Cine was the fifth defensive player from Georgia taken in the first round, an NFL record for one school.
12 pick for Alabama wide receiver Jameson Williams, a potential superstar who slipped a bit because heâ€™s recovering from a torn ACL.
The Vikings have six-time Pro Bowl pick Harrison Smith entrenched at one safety spot, but heâ€™s 33.

If you thought the Vikings were busy on Day 1 of the 2022 NFL Draft, just wait until you see the action Day 2 brings.
The Vikings traded down from 12 to 32 in a deal with the Lions, also sending the 46th pick to Detroit and receiving picks 34 and 66.
50: Skyy Moore, WR, Western MichiganIt seems likely that the Vikings' pick at 34 will come from that group, though nothing is certain in a draft like this one.

There are a lot of different mathematical models teams use to calculate draft pick value.
For what itâ€™s worth, I actually donâ€™t hate the player the Vikings ended up with.
Had the Vikings made that move, it would have been a big night for them.
The Vikings now need to work to correct their own terrible trade, when there were so many better paths of action.

     Vikings enter Friday's second round near front of the line, and with more needs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After trading back 20 spots in Thursday night's first round, the Vikings won't have to wait long to be on the clock Friday night.
The Vikings hold the second pick â€“ 34th overall â€“ in the second round, which general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah could take in multiple directions with needs remaining at cornerback, defensive line and receiver, among others, and other NFL teams potentially looking to trade up.
Adofo-Mensah referenced a "curveball" in getting a late trade offer for the 32nd overall pick on Thursday night, when they ultimately selected Georgia safety Lewis Cine.
The Vikings addressed the secondary by drafting Cine at the end of the first round, with Adofo-Mensah citing his "special" range in coverage.
Two prospects discussed as possible first-round options, Clemson's Andrew Booth Jr. and Washington's Kyler Gordon, didn't hear their names called and may be worth a swing at the top of the second round.
