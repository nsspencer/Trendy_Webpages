     Group seeks ethics investigation into Madison Cawthorn
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A political action group is asking for an ethics investigation of North Carolina Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn, citing his pattern of bringing weapons into banned spaces and a possible inappropriate financial relationship with a staffer.
The group, American Muckrakers PAC, wrote to the Office of Congressional Ethics on Wednesday asking for an investigation after Cawthorn was cited — but not charged — for attempting to bring a loaded gun through security at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina.
It can refer its investigations to the bipartisan House Ethics Committee, conduct its own investigations and dole out fines as punishment for violations.
Aside from weapons, the Muckrakers PAC complaint focuses on Cawthorn's relationship with Smith, a young staffer.
The North Carolina congressman's behavior has drawn some criticism from his fellow Republicans in the House.

     Summary: "There needs to be a thorough and bipartisan inquiry into the matter by the House Ethics Committee."
There have also been allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct made against Cawthorn by women who attended college with him.
That comment caused notable friction between Cawthorn and other members of the GOP, including House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who said the young lawmaker had "lost [his] trust."
Since then, headlines have continued to mount, though Cawthorn has dismissed the most recent criticism as a "coordinated assault" coming from RINOs (Republicans in Name Only).
Cawthorn is currently running in a crowded GOP primary in North Carolina's 13th District though voters have attempted to challenge his candidacy.
