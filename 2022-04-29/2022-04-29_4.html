     Summary: Wimbledon champion Boris Becker gets 2 1/2 years in prison for bankruptcy offensesEnlarge this image toggle caption Alastair Grant/AP Alastair Grant/APLONDON — Tennis great Boris Becker was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison on Friday for illicitly transferring large amounts of money and hiding assets after he was declared bankrupt.
The three-time Wimbledon champion was convicted earlier this month on four charges under the Insolvency Act and had faced a maximum sentence of seven years in prison.
The jury at Southwark Crown Court in London acquitted him on 20 other counts, including charges that he failed to hand over his many awards, including two Wimbledon trophies and an Olympic gold medal.
Becker, wearing a striped tie in Wimbledon's purple and green colors, walked into the courthouse hand in hand with girlfriend Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro.
The six-time Grand Slam champion has denied all the charges, saying he had cooperated with trustees tasked with securing his assets — even offering up his wedding ring — and had acted on expert advice.

     Former tennis star Boris Becker sentenced to 2.5 years in prison after bankruptcy fraud
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former tennis star Boris Becker was sentenced to more than two years in prison on Friday after he illegally transferred large amounts of money after declaring that he was bankrupt, according to The Associated Press.
Becker was convicted in London earlier this month on four charges under the country’s Insolvency Act, per the report.
Becker said during the trial that his bankruptcy came from a $4.8 million loan in 2013 and then about a $1.6 million loan from a businessman in 2014.
Becker, a six-time Grand Slam winner, earned about $50 million throughout his tennis career.
He won Wimbledon two other times during his career, along with the U.S. Open and the Australian Open twice.
