     Summary: Anyone that’s heard of the term “hit sticking” will feel right at home with the arrival of Lewis Cine to the Minnesota Vikings’ defensive backfield.
32 overall pick of the 2022 NFL draft on Thursday night, after the Vikings engineered a surprise trade with the rival Detroit Lions.
After missing out on the top cornerbacks in the draft, the Vikings decided to go with a safety, which is a high positional need.
Cine is a player capable of stepping into the lineup and helping the Vikings win right away.

     Summary: Vikings Trade Down With LionsAt pick No.
Many other trade charts base themselves on how prospects tend to turn out, and they almost always declare the trade down the winner over the trade up.
Vikings Get: Lions Get: Pick 32 (Lewis Cine, S, Georgia)Pick 34Pick 66 Pick 12 (Jameson Williams, WR Alabama)Pick 46The Rich Hill chart has the Vikings losing the trade by about 50 points, equivalent to a third-round pick.
He doesn’t have the ball skills of a true cover safety either, only notching one interception in his career.
Let’s say the Vikings had Hamilton as their 12th-ranked player and Cine as their 15th-ranked player.
