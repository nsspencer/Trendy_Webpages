     Tennis star Boris Becker jailed for hiding assets after bankruptcy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A London court sentenced tennis star Boris Becker to 2 1/2 years in prison on Friday for hiding assets after he was declared bankrupt, AP reported.
Driving the news: The six-time Grand Slam champion was convicted of four charges under Britain's Insolvency Act earlier this month.
Becker, 54, was found guilty of transferring money to his ex-wife Barbara Becker and estranged wife Sharlely Becker after he was declared bankrupt in June 2017.
The big picture: Becker won his first Wimbledon at 17 in 1985, becoming the youngest men's singles champion in the tournament's history.
He also won the U.S. Open in 1989 and the Australian Open in 1991 and 1996, giving him six Grand Slam singles titles.

     Summary: Wimbledon champion Boris Becker gets 2 1/2 years in prison for bankruptcy offensesEnlarge this image toggle caption Alastair Grant/AP Alastair Grant/APLONDON — Tennis great Boris Becker was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison on Friday for illicitly transferring large amounts of money and hiding assets after he was declared bankrupt.
The three-time Wimbledon champion was convicted earlier this month on four charges under the Insolvency Act and had faced a maximum sentence of seven years in prison.
The jury at Southwark Crown Court in London acquitted him on 20 other counts, including charges that he failed to hand over his many awards, including two Wimbledon trophies and an Olympic gold medal.
Becker, wearing a striped tie in Wimbledon's purple and green colors, walked into the courthouse hand in hand with girlfriend Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro.
The six-time Grand Slam champion has denied all the charges, saying he had cooperated with trustees tasked with securing his assets — even offering up his wedding ring — and had acted on expert advice.

     Summary: Becker arrives at London's Southwark Crown Court for his sentencing on Friday.
CNN —Six-time grand slam champion Boris Becker was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail on Friday for flouting the terms of his bankruptcy in 2017, according to the UK’s Insolvency Service.
1 and three-time Wimbledon champion, was found guilty of four offenses relating to his bankruptcy, including failing to disclose, concealing and removing significant assets, the Insolvency Service said.
“Today’s verdict confirms that Boris Becker failed to comply with his legal obligation to declare significant assets in his bankruptcy,” said Dean Beale, chief executive of the Insolvency Service.
He has remained active in the tennis world since retiring from the sport, notably as the coach of Novak Djokovic and through frequent media appearances as a commentator and pundit.
