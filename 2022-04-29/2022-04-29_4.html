    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the 32nd overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, the Minnesota Vikings have selected Georgia safety Lewis Cine.
At 6-foot-1, 200 pounds, Cine is a "long safety who plays in cover two, single high and man against tight ends," according NFL.com analyst Daniel Jeremiah.
His physical traits breed confidence that Cine could translate into a single high safety in the NFL.
The athletic ability cannot be questioned about Lewis and will allow him to play in a lot of man-to-man coverage as a box safety.
But what makes Cine stand out in the opinion of SI Dawgs Daily's Brooks Austin is his play as a box safety.

     Summary: With the 32nd pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the Minnesota Vikings select Georgia S Lewis Cine.
Moreover, there are still a lot of good cornerbacks on the board, and Minnesota has extra picks to deal with that.
Cine was named Massachusetts Defensive Player of the Year in 2017, the same year the Everett won the state championship.
Even if he’s in the deep third, your simple swing pass can be blown up once Cine gets a bead on your running back.
Over time, and once he cleans up a few things in coverage and with his tackling, he could be a top-10 NFL safety with his athleticism, aggressiveness, and coverage potential.
