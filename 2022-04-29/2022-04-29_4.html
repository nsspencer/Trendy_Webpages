     Pressure Mounts on Cawthorn as Scandals Pile Up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Besieged by multiplying scandals and salacious accusations, Representative Madison Cawthorn, Republican of North Carolina, is under mounting pressure from both parties to end his short career in Congress.
That came just days after pictures surfaced of him wearing women’s lingerie as part of a cruise ship game, imagery that might not go over well in the conservative stretches of his Western North Carolina district.
And last month he was charged with driving with a revoked license for the second time since 2017.
A political group supporting Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, has been pouring money into an ad campaign accusing Mr. Cawthorn of being a fame-seeking liar.
The group is supporting the campaign of a more mainstream Republican, State Senator Chuck Edwards, who is running against Mr. Cawthorn.

     'Pathetic': Madison Cawthorn Responds to Ethics Complaint Over Conduct
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Representative Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina has denounced a "pathetic" ethics complaint made against him as scandals involving the first-term Republican continue to pile up.
The group Fire Madison Cawthorn, which is operated by the American Muckrakers PAC, submitted an ethics complaint to the Office of Congressional Ethics on Wednesday.
The ethics complaint from the American Muckrakers PAC alleges inappropriate and undisclosed payments and gifts from Cawthorn to Smith, who the group said lives with and has a close "personal relationship" with Cawthorn.
The complaint also references the airport incidents and Cawthorn allegedly brining "daggers" to North Carolina schools on multiple occasions.
"The House Ethics Committee complaint we filed relates to Cawthorn's short tenure in Congress not his early 20's which was only 2 years ago," he added.

     Group seeks ethics investigation into Madison Cawthorn
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A political action group is asking for an ethics investigation of North Carolina Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn, citing his pattern of bringing weapons into banned spaces and a possible inappropriate financial relationship with a staffer.
The group, American Muckrakers PAC, wrote to the Office of Congressional Ethics on Wednesday asking for an investigation after Cawthorn was cited — but not charged — for attempting to bring a loaded gun through security at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina.
It can refer its investigations to the bipartisan House Ethics Committee, conduct its own investigations and dole out fines as punishment for violations.
Aside from weapons, the Muckrakers PAC complaint focuses on Cawthorn's relationship with Smith, a young staffer.
The North Carolina congressman's behavior has drawn some criticism from his fellow Republicans in the House.

     Why Madison Cawthorn triggers Republicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It isn't a huge shock news to consumers of mainstream media to hear reports that Republicans on Capitol Hill like to tie one on.
None of that information will penetrate the information bubble Republican voters have constructed for themselves, of fundamentalist YouTubers and Facebook personalities like Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens.
RELATED: Fellow Republican rips freshman GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn over "insane" threat of "bloodshed"That's why the leakers of these photos and video believe they will damage Cawthorn.
But for people who live inside the conservative media bubble, this sort of stuff could easily be read as Satanic decadence.
The Republican goal here is clearly to get Cawthorn out of Congress and, more crucially, out of the right-wing media ecosystem.
