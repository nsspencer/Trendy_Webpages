     GOP Senator Calls For Insider Trading Probe Of Rep. Madison Cawthorn
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) has called for an investigation of Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) for possible insider trading in cryptocurrency.
Insider trading by a member of Congress is a serious betrayal of their oath, and Congressman Cawthorn owes North Carolinians an explanation.
In the post, Cawthorn hyped the coin, boasted that he owned it and said it would “go to the moon” the following day.
Although Cawthorn is not a target of the suit, he is named as one of the “celebrities” who touted the coin.
Cawthorn has come under fire in recent months over repeated encounters with law enforcement involving firearms and traffic offenses.
