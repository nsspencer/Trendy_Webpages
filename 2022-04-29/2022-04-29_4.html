     Pressure Mounts on Cawthorn as Scandals Pile Up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Besieged by multiplying scandals and salacious accusations, Representative Madison Cawthorn, Republican of North Carolina, is under mounting pressure from both parties to end his short career in Congress.
That came just days after pictures surfaced of him wearing women’s lingerie as part of a cruise ship game, imagery that might not go over well in the conservative stretches of his Western North Carolina district.
And last month he was charged with driving with a revoked license for the second time since 2017.
A political group supporting Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, has been pouring money into an ad campaign accusing Mr. Cawthorn of being a fame-seeking liar.
The group is supporting the campaign of a more mainstream Republican, State Senator Chuck Edwards, who is running against Mr. Cawthorn.

     Group seeks ethics investigation into Madison Cawthorn
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A political action group is asking for an ethics investigation of North Carolina Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn, citing his pattern of bringing weapons into banned spaces and a possible inappropriate financial relationship with a staffer.
The group, American Muckrakers PAC, wrote to the Office of Congressional Ethics on Wednesday asking for an investigation after Cawthorn was cited — but not charged — for attempting to bring a loaded gun through security at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina.
It can refer its investigations to the bipartisan House Ethics Committee, conduct its own investigations and dole out fines as punishment for violations.
Aside from weapons, the Muckrakers PAC complaint focuses on Cawthorn's relationship with Smith, a young staffer.
The North Carolina congressman's behavior has drawn some criticism from his fellow Republicans in the House.

     Why Madison Cawthorn triggers Republicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It isn't a huge shock news to consumers of mainstream media to hear reports that Republicans on Capitol Hill like to tie one on.
None of that information will penetrate the information bubble Republican voters have constructed for themselves, of fundamentalist YouTubers and Facebook personalities like Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens.
RELATED: Fellow Republican rips freshman GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn over "insane" threat of "bloodshed"That's why the leakers of these photos and video believe they will damage Cawthorn.
But for people who live inside the conservative media bubble, this sort of stuff could easily be read as Satanic decadence.
The Republican goal here is clearly to get Cawthorn out of Congress and, more crucially, out of the right-wing media ecosystem.

     Timeline of Madison Cawthorn controversies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Madison Cawthorn ( R-N.C.) has been a lightning rod for controversy.
And Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) on Wednesday called for a House Ethics Committee investigation into Cawthorn over allegations of insider trading.
The Asheville Citizen Times reported that Cawthorn was facing three citations for incidents occurring across three counties in North Carolina.
“Insider trading by a member of Congress is a serious betrayal of their oath, and Congressman Cawthorn owes North Carolinians an explanation.
Tillis has come out in support of a primary challenger to Cawthorn, state Sen. Chuck Edwards (R), in recent weeks.
