     Chicago Bears Get ‘A’ 1st Round Grade From Draft Expert Despite No Pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bears were absent from the 1st round action of the NFL draft for the third time since 2019.
He delivered his draft grades after Thursday night with a surprise twist.
Even the teams that didn’t actually pick in the 1st round got grades too.
That was hammered home on Thursday when only one of them managed to go in the 1st round.
If Fields ends up working out for the Bears, nobody will remember them having no 1st round pick in this draft.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bears didn’t have a selection in the first round so we are still waiting to see what a draft selection looks like from new general manager Ryan Poles.
Based on how round one went on Thursday, there is a lot to be excited about.
There was also a string of wide receivers taken in the first round which is not the best news.
The Chicago Bears need a good one really bad and now they are going to have a bit slimmer pickings than they originally thought.
There are still going to be a lot of good players available to the Chicago Bears.
