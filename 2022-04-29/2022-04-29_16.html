     White House Sets Up Monumentally Stupidly Named ‘Disinformation Governance Board’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is very easy to read “Disinformation Governance Board” and think it is some Orwellian government program designed to qualitatively analyze information in order to deem it either suitable to be expressed, or forbidden.
From the AP article about the board’s launching:A newly formed Disinformation Governance Board announced Wednesday will immediately begin focusing on misinformation aimed at migrants, a problem that has helped to fuel sudden surges at the U.S. southern border in recent years.
Meanwhile, the other thing that seems like it could be an interesting idea for a government “disinformation board” to do is simply to do more research into how and why disinformation has traction.
But everything about the way this Disinformation Governance Board has been rolled out has been a disaster.

     Summary: Local police have cordoned off the area and the National Guard has set up a perimeter at 15 miles.
DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told a House panel Wednesday that the governance board would counter the threat of misinformation and disinformation for elections and homeland security.
They're afraid that we might actually think for ourselves.”Spare a thought for Nina Jankowicz, who has stepped up to lead this effort at the Department of Homeland Security.
And there had to be a better name for it than the Disinformation Governance Board, a monicker that sounds as though it were made of steel, concrete, and barbed-wire.

     Disinformation Governance Board to tackle spread of misinformation in U.S., focusing on Russia and U.S.-Mexico border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Department of Homeland Security is setting up a Disinformation Governance Board to try to counter the spread of false information.
The board will focus on disinformation coming from Russia as well as misleading messages about the U.S.-Mexico border, the Associated Press reports.
The immediate focus will be on misinformation from human smugglers, who spread false claims about U.S. border policy to migrants to help drum up business.
"The Russians engage in… very active disinformation, misinformation, and in fact information warfare as a key part of their arsenal," Wray told CBS News' Scott Pelley.
Recent disinformation from Russia includes the false claim last month that American National Guard troops were killed fighting in Ukraine.

     What is the Biden administration's new ‘Disinformation Governance Board’?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadThe Department of Homeland Security’s creation of a Disinformation Governance Board has set off a backlash on the right — even as it’s not entirely clear what the perhaps unfortunately named board will do.
Choose your plan ArrowRight Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas mentioned the creation of the board in multiple congressional hearings this week.
“Congressman, the Disinformation Board addresses disinformation that imperils the safety and security of our homeland,” Mayorkas said.
🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/C4xiEGfhDt — Nina Jankowicz 🇺🇦🇺🇸 (@wiczipedia) April 27, 2022Which brings us back to the Disinformation Governance Board.
“It recants some of the language in their letter, which I never adopted.”Somewhat similarly, the name “Disinformation Governance Board” does sound a bit ominous; it sounds less like an effort to combat disinformation rather than to, well, govern it.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The idea that Covid could have come from a Chinese lab was similarly dismissed as disinformation; now it’s considered a legitimate possibility by the Biden administration.
By conjuring the Disinformation Governance Board into existence, the Biden administration will give itself a referee’s power to declare some things completely out of bounds.
Somehow we survived the Soviet onslaught without a Disinformation Governance Board to guide us.
Anybody who is good at inventing lies can produce disinformation faster than anybody can shoot disinformation down.
Earlier this week, David C. Lowery of Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker fame responded to the Disinformation Governance Board news by tweeting a poll: “Okay you’re a punk rocker in 1982 and the Department of Homeland Security under President Reagan sets up a Disinformation Governance Board to combat disinformation.
