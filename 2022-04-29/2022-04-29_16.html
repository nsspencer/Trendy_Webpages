     Cleveland Browns Select David Bell, WR Purdue with the 99th Overall Pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the third of their three third round picks, the Cleveland Browns selected wide receiver David Bell from Purdue.
With the first of two third-round compensatory selections the Cleveland Browns receive for the hire of Kwesi Adolfo-Mensah as general manager of the Minnesota Viking, the Browns used the 99th pick in the third round to select wide receiver David Bell from Purdue.
The hitch with Bell and the reason he's still available is because he's not particularly athletic.
He's going to function in a similar role as former Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry.
Bell was reasonably productive against man coverage, which might bode well for his ability to function in the NFL.

     Cleveland Browns redeem themselves with the pick of Alex Wright
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cleveland Browns select edge Alex Wright with the 78th pick of the 2022 NFL draft.
In what has been one of the weirdest drafts in recent Cleveland Browns history, Andrew Berry selected Alex Wright with the 78th pick of the 2022 NFL Draft.
Berry and the Browns had seemingly been punting on the draft up until the selection of the edge defender with massive upside.
But Wright will be given the chance to grow in the Browns defensive scheme and eventually earn a starting spot across from Garrett.
All in all, the Browns got an absolute steal getting an athlete of Wright’s caliber with the 78th pick.

     Summary: "What we do love about him is he is big, he is long and he is physical.
The last pick will perhaps draw the most attention from the Browns on Day 2.
Bell was one of the top receivers available for the day, and the Browns were able to grab him at No.
Bell is capable of playing in the slot and outside and will be worth watching closely through offseason workouts.
"He is also very savvy as a route runner, just very nuanced and polished and has the ability to separate.
