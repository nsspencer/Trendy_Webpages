     Summary: Big news for fans nostalgic about TV shows from the 2000s that are, in turn, about being nostalgic about the 1970s, as THR reports that Netflix’s upcoming That ’90s Show has signed deals to bring back five out of the six main cast members of That ’70s Show, excepting only co-star Danny Masterson.

He’s set to stand trial on three charges of rape in August of this year. )
Specifically, Topher Grace, Laura Prepon, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, and Wilmer Valderrama have all reportedly signed deals to appear on the streaming service-set sequel , reuniting them with fellow ’70s castmates Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp, who were already part of the cast.
The series stars Callie Haverda as Leia For man, the daughter of Grace and Prepon’s characters, who comes to stay with her grandparents (Smith and Rupp) for a summer in the 1990s.
