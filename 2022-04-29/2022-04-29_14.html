     How To Make A Mii For Nintendo Switch Sports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But perhaps the most egregious crime committed by Nintendo Switch Sports is how it totally sidelines Miis, the lovable oddball player-created avatars who’ve defined Nintendo accounts for years.
Like its forebear, Nintendo Switch Sports is a sports sim in which you use motion controls—Joy-Cons, in this case—to engage in various activities.
How To Create A Mii In Nintendo Switch SportsFirst, from your Switch’s homescreen settings, scroll down to the “Mii” menu, then click on “create a new Mii.” You’ll see options to make one from scratch, or to use a procedurally generated one as a canvas.
AdvertisementNathaniel Bandy, the popular Nintendo-focused YouTuber, cited the eternally memeable Matt Mii as one of three crucial absent features from Nintendo Switch Sports.
But for those who must have him in Nintendo Switch Sports, he’s not all gone!

     Nintendo Switch Sports isn’t really built for the Switch Lite
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nintendo Switch Sports, out Friday on Nintendo Switch, brings back the motion-controlled fun of Wii Sports for the modern era, letting players enjoy bowling, soccer, badminton, and more with their Joy-Cons.
But if you’re a Nintendo Switch Lite owner, be aware that the experience is much more limited, thanks to the game’s dependency on motion controls.
Switch Lite owners will need an external set of Joy-Cons to play Nintendo Switch Sports, similar to how earlier motion-control-dependent games like Ring Fit Adventure and 1-2-Switch work.
(Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers are not compatible with Nintendo Switch Sports, Nintendo says on its support website.)
But there are more severe limits on local multiplayer in Nintendo Switch Sports on a Switch Lite, so if you were planning on playing a close-quarters game of doubles tennis, for example, that’s not possible locally.

     Nintendo Switch Sports | Critical Consensus

     Summary: Nintendo Switch Sports | Critical Consensus Spiritual successor to the iconic Wii title is a fun, polished reboot, but doesn't quite knock it out of the parkDanielle Partis News Editor Friday 29th April 2022 Share this article ShareToday sees the release of Nintendo Switch Sports, a spiritual successor to the successful Wii Sports title that launched with the titular console 16 years ago.
As such, a reboot of the game for the Nintendo Switch -- now Nintendo's best-selling console -- was much anticipated.
Nintendo Switch Sports, on the other hand, feels complete."
"Nintendo Switch Sports tries to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle moment with a tighter but all too familiar experience" Colin Stevens, IGNIGN was a little more reserved; in a 7/10 review, Colin Stevens said Nintendo Switch Sports "tries to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle moment with a tighter but all too familiar experience."
"If you're keen on simply playing some motion-controlled Wii Sports-like games on your Switch then Nintendo Switch Sports might bring you a good bit of enjoyment," NintendoLife's Olney said.

     Nintendo Switch Sports review: "Really is a social game through and through"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What Nintendo Switch Sports does well is to mix that nostalgia with plenty of freshness.
Oddly for someone who has no interest in the real sport whatsoever, it's football that I've had the most fun with in Switch Sports.
The game literally tells you what move to pull off next, which leaves you feeling more like you've triggered a QTE than really engaged.
It really is a social game through and through.
Nintendo Switch Sports officially launches on April 29, exclusively on Switch.

     Summary: Subscribe to Nintendo Life onNote: At the original time of publication, online functionality was not yet live for Nintendo Switch Sports.
Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)Bowling is (as it always has been in Nintendo’s sport games) an absolute delight.
Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)And lastly we have Tennis.
However in the case of Nintendo Switch Sports, there's still just not enough variety to keep things interesting for anything longer than an hour or so.
Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)As far as looks go, it's a generally decent effort.
