     Summary: With Georgia linebacker Nakobe Dean falling down draft boards there are questions about whether or not the Chicago Bears should draft him.
Dean is dealing with multiple injury questions and some teams have decided that he is not worth the risk.
From NFL Draft Kickoff: A look at why #Georgia LB Nakobe Dean is still on the board, plus the #Bucs are getting calls at No.
The other added factor is that with multiple injuries over multiple years including a recent one is that Dean is undersized already.

     Summary: When the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft kicked off on Friday night, it was all about a few key positions of need for the Chicago Bears.
39 overall, the Chicago Bears solidified their cornerback position by selecting Washington cornerback Kyler Gordon.
If this cornerback room is healthy, then the Chicago Bears completely renovated that position with a matter of two particular players.
Kyler Gordon immediately makes the Chicago Bears’ cornerback room one to reckon with.
The Chicago Bears got someone who will be able to read the quarterback in a hurry, but make a move immediately once he understands where the ball is going.

     Kyler Gordon Selected 39th Overall by the Chicago Bears
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington has been the cream of the crop over the past half-decade putting defensive backs into the NFL and they added a 2nd one in the last 24 hours as Kyler Gordon was taken...Kyler Gordon’s wait is finally over after he was taken 39th overall by the Chicago Bears.
This was the expectation coming into the weekend that Gordon would either get taken late round one or early in round two.
New coach Matt Eberflus was likely salivating to get a player like Kyler Gordon on his defense, hence the trade up to select him.
Gordon started out his sophomore year as a starter on the outside but after a few games lost his starting spot to now 1st round pick Trent McDuffie.
Gordon finished the 4-game season with 15 tackles and 3 pass break-ups.
