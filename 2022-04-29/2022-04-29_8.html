     Future – ‘I NEVER LIKED YOU’ review: Atlanta’s trap overlord proves he’s still on top
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But then a great run of tracks appears in the middle of the album, proving that Future is more mature than he’s given credit for.
‘WAIT FOR U’, the first of two Drake and Future collaborations on the record and featuring Nigerian breakthrough star Tems, is a schmoozy love song.
AdvertisementTrap overlord Future certainly shines the best atop moodier, more traditional trap sounds on this album; by the end you’ll have forgiven the disappointing opening volley.
Ready for everywhere – from Magic City to the gym – this totally uncompromising tune perfectly demonstrates why we still love Future today.
After more than a decade of working alongside the Atlanta’s rap pool – which continues to grow in talent and notoriety – Future has proved time and again that he’s special.
