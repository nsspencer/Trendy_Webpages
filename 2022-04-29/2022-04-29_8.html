    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA CLARA — Business picks up today for the 49ers in the NFL draft.
Well, that’s unlikely for Deebo Samuel, seeing how he wasn’t dealt amid Thursday’s first round like two other wide receivers were from his 2019 draft class.
DEFENSIVE END: Three of the draft’s first five picks hit this spot, then two more later in the opening round.
OTHER NOTES— No running backs nor tight ends were taken in the first round, and only four cornerbacks were picked.
— Here were the first-round products from among the 49ers’ 2022 opponents:Cardinals: WR Marquise Brown; trade with BaltimoreSeahawks: OT Charles Cross, No.

     49ers Turned Down Two Deebo Samuel Trade Offers, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a drama-filled first round of the 2022 NFL draft, it appears that the 49ers are serious in their desire to keep All-Pro wide receiver Deebo Samuel.
On Monday, 49ers general manager John Lynch addressed the trade rumors surrounding Samuel saying he had no intention of dealing his team’s best offensive weapon.
NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport appeared on The Pat McAfee Show on Friday, emphasizing San Francisco’s goal of not letting Samuel go to another team.
The 49ers turned down two offers from teams for the star wideout, he says.

     49ers turn down Deebo Samuel trade offers from Jets, Lions: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 49ers look like they’re not budging when it comes to Deebo Samuel.
They received trade offers from both the Jets and Lions in Thursday night’s first round of the NFL Draft and declined both, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.
“The Jets offered pick 10 and a pick swap — so basically what would have been the equivalent of between pick 13 and 14, so pick 10 and a little less — for Deebo Samuel,” he said.
And I think they’re going to try to make this better, but will they?
There’s a lot more questions than answers with the Deebo Samuel situation now that he didn’t get traded last night.”Teammate Arik Armstead spoke briefly about the Samuel situation Friday on NFL Network’s Good Morning Football.

     Deebo Samuel trade decision puts 49ers on one side of changing NFL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In an offseason that has highlighted a stark change in NFL team building, the 49ers have gone against the tide.
For years NFL teams have viewed building around rookie receivers as a gamble.
Brown became the latest star receiver to be traded this offseason, joining Davante Adams and Tyreek Hill.
But while the Titans were fielding calls for and eventually trading Brown, the 49ers did not move disgruntled receiver Deebo Samuel, who has asked for a trade.
The 49ers' decision to keep Samuel, trying to mend fences with a disgruntled Samuel, reveals a few things.
