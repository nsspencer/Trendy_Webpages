     Memory movie review: Liam Neeson film astounds you with its laziness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Memory movie director: Martin CampbellMemory movie cast: Liam Neeson, Monica Bellucci, Guy Pearce, Taj AtwalMemory movie rating: 1.5 starsLiam Neeson has played so many versions of this cynical, ageing (but never aged) assassin that memory perhaps is not what he needs to get it right.
And it is not – despite the entire premise for this film being that Alex Lewis (Neeson) is an assassin with a difference, for being an assassin with Alzheimer’s.
Even if you are willing to forget that, Memory just astounds you with its laziness in all the other aspects of filming as well.
A processing centre for illegal Mexican immigrants, built with big money, being misused to meet the base needs of those behind it.
Those faces behind bars are not easily forgotten; the many dead bodies Lewis leaves behind are not easy to remember.

     Memory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Martin Campbell’s Memory (the 78-year-old Casino Royale director like Neeson still has his mojo), he plays Alex Lewis, a contract killer telling his sponsors he’s done, but they refuse to accept his offer.
The audience immediately sides with the hit man and shows no sympathy for the rich people doing the reprehensible trafficking.
The strongest leitmotif is that of memory, or the lack thereof, so that the early-onset Alzheimer’s plays a technical part of the plot and a thematic reminder that combating trafficking is going to involve memory, not just of the computer kind.
One memory Alex never loses is the murder of young Beatriz, for whose violent end Alex was not responsible.
HIS CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR,” says the memory poster.

     ‘Memory’ Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the surprise 2008 hit Taken grossed nearly nine times its budget worldwide, Liam Neeson, then 56, became the go-to guy for a very specific genre: the Old-Man Action Movie.
But Neeson is the first undisputed king of the micro-genre since Charles Bronson made the first Death Wish at 53.
Neeson is now almost 70, and Memory is the next, logical step in the Old-Man Action Movie: old cartel hit man vs. Alzheimer’s.
Neeson stars as Alex Lewis, a paid killer for the cartels who is suffering from memory loss thanks to the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.
The action in Memory is more stilted, less dynamic.

     Review: 'Memory' is mostly a standard-issue Neeson film
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Jake Coyle | Associated Press“Memory” is an interesting title for the latest Liam Neeson thriller.
Do you remember the last Liam Neeson thriller?
“Memory,” which opens in theaters Friday, doesn’t much alter the formula but makes for a brutal and bleak variation on the Liam Neeson theme.
If the Liam Neeson thriller has cast Neeson as a kind of globe-trotting vigilante and defender of justice in a fallen world, it’s fitting that he should make his way to the U.S.-Mexican border.
Pearce, sweaty and grungy, steadies “Memory”; it’s his film as much as Neeson’s.

     In Memory, Liam Neeson Gets to Act More Than Usual
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liam Neeson in Memory.
His latest, Memory, directed by action legend Martin Campbell (Casino Royale, The Mask of Zorro), offers a helpful reminder that Neeson kicking ass need not mean Neeson on acting autopilot.
When we first meet Alex Lewis (Neeson), he’s posing as a nurse in order to brutally strangle a man visiting his sick mother in the hospital.
But overall, Memory works not so much as a procedural — it’s a bit too simply plotted for that — as it does as a character study.
That speaks to why he’s able to keep offing people even as he seems to be losing his cognitive abilities.
