     Summary: After trading picks #38 and #146 to the New York Giants to move up to #36, with the 36th overall selection in the 2022 NFL draft the New York Jets have selected Breece Hall out of Iowa State University.
The Jets needed a running back to pair with Michael Carter.
Hall is widely considered to be the best running back in this draft and a potential three down back in the NFL.
He and Michael Carter have the potential to become one of the best running back duos in the NFL.
That sounds pretty good to me.

     Iowa State running back Breece Hall selected by New York Jets in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Iowa State’s Breece Hall is an NFL running back.
One of the top three backs in Iowa State history was selected by the New York Jets in the second round of the NFL Draft Friday night.
Many NFL Draft experts pegged Hall, who left Iowa State after his junior season, to Buffalo as the 25th pick of the first round.
“Breece has prepared for this moment and I am thrilled for him and his family,” Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said.
“Breece had a really special career at Iowa State and played such an important role in the success our program has had the last few seasons.

     2022 NFL Draft: Pure smoke behind Breece Hall first-round rumors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Beane told the media afterwards that those rumors linking the Bills to Hall were just that: rumors and they originated from outside of One Bills Drive.
“I definitely heard about [the Hall rumors],” Beane said.
Nationally it was definitely Breece Hall, and I’m assuming a lot of people are kind of studying what other people are saying, too.
Doesn't seem like there was any validity to Breece Hall rumors.
— Jon Scott (@JonScottTV) April 29, 2022The Bills could still draft Hall (or another running back) in Friday’s second and third rounds of the draft.

     Jets trade up to select Iowa State RB Breece Hall in Round 2 of 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Jets and New York Giants executed a trade early in the second round Friday night.
With the pick, the Jets snagged Iowa State running back Breece Hall.
Over three seasons at Iowa State, Hall racked up 3,941 yards rushing and 50 rushing touchdowns to go with 734 yards receiving on 82 receptions for six receiving scores.
Pairing that with a 5-foot-11, 217-pound frame, Hall is very much the prototype for today's NFL running back.
In New York, Hall pairs with 2021 fourth-rounder Michael Carter to form a dynamic young duo.

     Summary: The Jets began Round 2 with a trade and a bang.
They moved up two spots from the38th spot that they held from the Sam Darnold trade with Carolina in 2021, while sending their fifth-round pick to the Giants in a trade between stadium mates.
36 selection, the Jets then selected Iowa State's Breece Hall, making him the first back taken in this year's draft.
"Jets fans are getting a three-down back, a guy that can catch the ball, make people miss, run you over," Hall said after the selection.
He didn't succeed that second time, but then orchestrated the pick with the Giants to move up two spots at the top of Round 2.
