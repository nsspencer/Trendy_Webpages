     Manchin’s Opposition Imperils Electric-Car Tax Credits as Prices Rise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Senator Joe Manchin’s apparent opposition to a push by Democrats and the White House to expand a popular consumer incentive for electric vehicles threatens to widen a gap between the prices for traditional and electric cars at a time when interest in climate-friendly technology is ticking up.
The average transaction price of a new electric car was $60,054 in February, which was $1,820 more than the average manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $58,234, according to the latest data from Edmunds.com.
The average industrywide transaction price, including EVs, was $45,596, or $680 above an average MSRP of $44,916.

     Joe Manchin calls EV tax credits “ludicrous” in Senate hearing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Senator Joe Manchin called federal tax credits for electric vehicles "ludicrous" in a Senate hearing on Thursday.
Since 2009, the US has used federal tax credits as a way to offset the higher price of EVs thanks to their battery packs.
The tax credit also sunsets once a car manufacturer has sold 200,000 plug-in vehicles, although, so far, only Tesla and General Motors have crossed that threshold.
But the Democratic Party has a razor-thin majority in the Senate, and passing more tax credits would be impossible without Manchin's vote.
Manchin was questioning Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, urging his department to spend more money building more highways in West Virginia, when talk turned to EV tax credits.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ByWest Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin blasted a potential expansion of the electric vehicle (EV) tax credit on Thursday, while also calling for the development of the hydrogen sector to decarbonize the transportation industry.
The EV tax credit was set to be introduced with new terms.
It would have also put an end to EV credit caps, which Tesla and General Motors both have as they are disqualified from offering the credit after selling 200,000 EV units.
Manchin added that the money put toward expanding the EV tax credit program should be funneled to other sources, like research into hydrogen powertrains.

     Manchin criticizes key Biden tax policy on electric vehicles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. questioned a key Biden Administration energy policy Thursday when he called tax credits for electric vehicles “ludicrous” amid strong consumer demand and a lack of American production of EV batteries.
“There’s a waiting list for electric vehicles with the fuel price at $4.
But they still want us to throw $5,000, $7,000 or $12,000 credits at electric vehicles,” Manchin said Thursday during a Senate appropriations subcommittee hearing with U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on the U.S. DOT’s FY23 budget.
“We feel a sense of enormous urgency to accelerate not just the uptake of electric vehicles but their production and our productive capacity for them,” Buttigieg said.
China is responsible for 80% of the world’s electric battery and material processing and 75% of the world’s lithium-ion battery cell production, Manchin said.

     Summary: Twitter has tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it."
This whole adventure began with Musk buying a huge stake in the company — violating SEC disclosure rules along the way — and considering a seat on Twitter's board.
Twitter reportedly became more open to Musk’s bid in recent days.
"The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing," Twitter board chair Bret Taylor said in the deal announcement.
Twitter (except for maybe the company's former leader ) seemed resistant to Musk's bid.

     Summary: These are all my friends on both sides of the aisle,” Manchin said when asked about the book’s claim.
Democrats also have taken note that Manchin’s opposition to various Democratic initiatives appears to be playing well back home.
Fifty-seven percent of West Virginians now approve of Manchin’s job performance, compared to only 40 percent after the first three months of 2021.
It’s an unsettling development for Democratic senators who hoped a climate and renewable energy package would be a core piece of the budget reconciliation package.
Now the climate and energy piece of the reconciliation package is competing with what Manchin is trying to negotiate with a group of Republicans.

     Summary: Advocates for an expanded child tax credit (CTC) did not expect to be in this situation.
Within just six months, researchers estimated the expanded CTC payments had reduced the child poverty rate by 30 percent.
Coming back from the winter holiday, leading Senate supporters of the expanded child tax credit vowed to keep fighting, insisting a path through reconciliation was still there.
“I’ll keep working with all of my colleagues until an extension of the expanded CTC is signed into law,” he said.
The political cost of inactionNot being able to reach a deal on the child tax credit before the midterms could make an already grim-looking situation for Democrats worse.
