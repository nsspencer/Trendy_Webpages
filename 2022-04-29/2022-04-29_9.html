     49ers News: Why they were one of the winners of the NFL Draft’s first night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: John Lynch said the first round of the NFL Draft was going to be boring, and it was.
Despite mounting pressure from Samuel’s camp and at least one enticing offer, the 49ers stood firm and didn’t move their disgruntled superstar.
Nonetheless, the Eagles made the move of the night while also giving Brown a brand new contract.

     49ers turn down Deebo Samuel trade offers from Jets, Lions: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 49ers look like they’re not budging when it comes to Deebo Samuel.
They received trade offers from both the Jets and Lions in Thursday night’s first round of the NFL Draft and declined both, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.
“The Jets offered pick 10 and a pick swap — so basically what would have been the equivalent of between pick 13 and 14, so pick 10 and a little less — for Deebo Samuel,” he said.
And I think they’re going to try to make this better, but will they?
There’s a lot more questions than answers with the Deebo Samuel situation now that he didn’t get traded last night.”Teammate Arik Armstead spoke briefly about the Samuel situation Friday on NFL Network’s Good Morning Football.

     49ers Turned Down Two Deebo Samuel Trade Offers, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a drama-filled first round of the 2022 NFL draft, it appears that the 49ers are serious in their desire to keep All-Pro wide receiver Deebo Samuel.
On Monday, 49ers general manager John Lynch addressed the trade rumors surrounding Samuel saying he had no intention of dealing his team’s best offensive weapon.
NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport appeared on The Pat McAfee Show on Friday, emphasizing San Francisco’s goal of not letting Samuel go to another team.
The 49ers turned down two offers from teams for the star wideout, he says.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA CLARA — Business picks up today for the 49ers in the NFL draft.

OTHER NOTES— No running backs nor tight ends were taken in the first round, and only four cornerbacks were picked.
— Here were the first-round products from among the 49ers’ 2022 opponents:Cardinals: WR Marquise Brown; trade with BaltimoreSeahawks: OT Charles Cross, No.

But the decision to pay a premium to get Lance last spring looks even better after how the first round unfolded Thursday night.

That's a solid NFL quarterback, but the 49ers wanted more in a franchise signal-caller.
