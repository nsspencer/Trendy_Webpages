     BREAKING: Carolina Panthers Draft Ole Miss QB Matt Corral
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moments ago, the Carolina Panthers completed a trade with the New England Patriots to move up in the third round.
With that pick, the Panthers selected Ole Miss QB Matt Corral.
The Panthers will send the 137th pick and a 2023 3rd round pick to New England.
He has great but not elite arm strength and has tremendous pocket maneuverability while keeping his eyes downfield.

     NFL Network insider: Alcohol issues, 'unreliable behavior' caused Matt Corral's NFL Draft slide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport had some strong words about former Ole Miss quarterback Matt Corral after the Carolina Panthers picked Corral in the third round of the 2022 NFL Draft on Friday.
After four seasons and two dominant campaigns at Ole Miss, Corral was the fourth quarterback selected, going at No.
"He dealt with a multitude of issues including alcohol and related issues," Rapoport said on NFL Network's broadcast.
During his first two years on the team, Corral admittedly didn't watch film and didn't put in as much work as his status may have required of him.

     Panthers trade up to 3rd round, select QB Matt Corral
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Tuesday, general manager Scott Fitterer seemed quite sure the Carolina Panthers would be walking away from the 2022 NFL draft with a quarterback.
In a little leap of faith, Fitterer and the Panthers moved into the 94th overall pick on Friday night and drafted University of Mississippi quarterback Matt Corral.
Carolina, in exchange, has sent their 2023 third-round pick and this year’s 137th pick to the New England Patriots.
Draft Wire analyst Natalie Miller lauded Corral for his pro-ready mentality and technicality.
“Corral has endeared himself to his teammates, his fans, coaches, and undoubtedly all of that will bleed over onto NFL coaches and scouts,” Miller writes.

     Panthers trade up to select Ole Miss QB Matt Corral in third round of 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Panthers traded up into the third round of the 2022 NFL Draft to select Ole Miss quarterback Matt Corral on Friday in Las Vegas.
Corral was the fourth quarterback selected in the draft, but he could very well have the best chance at a starting job.
Ideal for the RPO game, Corral boasts a quick trigger and excellent athleticism.
X-rays on the injury were negative, but kept Corral from participating in much of the physical parts of the draft process.
Combining his enticing athleticism with a stellar NFL arm makes Corral a prospect who could be a gamer with the proper grooming.
