     Summary: (WAFB) - A legal analyst tells the 9News Investigators it’s unlikely Laine Hardy will spend any significant time in jail after being arrested on a felony charge, accused of spying on his ex-girlfriend.
RELATED: American Idol winner Laine Hardy accused of putting listening device in ex-girlfriend’s dorm room at LSUHe’s gone from the big screen to the big house.
Music star Laine Hardy left the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison hours after his arrest on Friday, April 29.
Borghardt calls it ironic that he’s asking for the very thing he’s accused of denying his ex-girlfriend.
Borghardt believes no amount of fame makes Laine Hardy-- or anyone else-- above the law.
