     Grading the Pittsburgh Steelers’ 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsTo say that the Pittsburgh Steelers crushed the 2022 NFL Draft in general manager Kevin Colbert’s final run with the team after 22 seasons is an understatement.
While Pickett steals the headlines of the draft class, the Steelers actually made several other moves to help improve the depth chart on their roster ahead of the 2022 season.

Other Steelers picks in 2022 NFL DraftCalvin Austin, WR, Memphis – Round 4, pick 138 – Having Austin slip all the way down to the fourth is yet another coup for the Steelers.
Even though they didn’t have a ton of draft capital and had to pick late in each round, the Steelers did extremely well.

     Summary: The two are sons of the late Craig "Ironhead" Heyward, a former NFL fullback who played for the Saints, Bears, Falcons, Rams and Colts from 1988-1998.
Connor plays with a fierceness of a Steeler.
The tight end owns strong hands and barrels through contact.
In addition, he brings a strong contested-catch game and a physicality after the catch to Pittsburgh.
The younger Heyward doesn't have great speed and needs to improve his blocking, but he's a hardnosed worker who could carve out a role.
