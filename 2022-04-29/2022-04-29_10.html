     BREAKING: Carolina Panthers Draft Ole Miss QB Matt Corral
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moments ago, the Carolina Panthers completed a trade with the New England Patriots to move up in the third round.
With that pick, the Panthers selected Ole Miss QB Matt Corral.
The Panthers will send the 137th pick and a 2023 3rd round pick to New England.
He has great but not elite arm strength and has tremendous pocket maneuverability while keeping his eyes downfield.

     NFL Network insider: Alcohol issues, 'unreliable behavior' caused Matt Corral's NFL Draft slide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport had some strong words about former Ole Miss quarterback Matt Corral after the Carolina Panthers picked Corral in the third round of the 2022 NFL Draft on Friday.
After four seasons and two dominant campaigns at Ole Miss, Corral was the fourth quarterback selected, going at No.
"He dealt with a multitude of issues including alcohol and related issues," Rapoport said on NFL Network's broadcast.
During his first two years on the team, Corral admittedly didn't watch film and didn't put in as much work as his status may have required of him.

     Panthers trade up to select Ole Miss QB Matt Corral in third round of 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Panthers traded up into the third round of the 2022 NFL Draft to select Ole Miss quarterback Matt Corral on Friday in Las Vegas.
Corral was the fourth quarterback selected in the draft, but he could very well have the best chance at a starting job.
Ideal for the RPO game, Corral boasts a quick trigger and excellent athleticism.
X-rays on the injury were negative, but kept Corral from participating in much of the physical parts of the draft process.
Combining his enticing athleticism with a stellar NFL arm makes Corral a prospect who could be a gamer with the proper grooming.

     Matt Corral felt an immediate "comfort" with Panthers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There were also signs that Corral was someone they wanted to work with as they watched the Sugar Bowl, when he went down with a high ankle sprain.
"I think you can go back to the bowl game and you watch when he gets hurt, and you watch every single guy on that field when he comes back out onto the field," Rhule said.
"I'm talking about trainers, I'm talking about running backs, I'm talking about D-linemen, they all come over to him.
One of the benefits in my life is when I go into some of these schools, there are kids that I recruited.
I sat in their houses, I talked to them.
