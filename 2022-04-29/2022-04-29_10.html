     Google Doodle celebrates Route 66, a touchstone of American car culture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The latest Google Doodle celebrates the anniversary of the creation of Route 66, the famous highway that ran from Chicago to Los Angeles and serves as a historical touchstone in American car culture.
Route 66 — which wouldn’t be fully paved until 1938 — coursed through Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona before arriving in California.
The 1950s steadily wore away at the charm and necessity of Route 66, most notably with the beginnings of the US Interstate System.
Ultimately, Route 66 was decommissioned from the US Highway System in 1985, but the mark it left on American culture drives on.
To celebrate the history of Route 66, the Googler responsible for today’s Doodle, Matthew Cruickshank, drove the entire 2,448-mile stretch of Route 66.

     Google Video Doodle Lets You Get Your Kicks on Route 66
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For many Americans, Route 66 holds a special place in their heart, evoking memories of days gone by.
Its position as Main Street of America was cemented by the hit 1946 song (Get Your Kicks on) Route 66, as well as in the '60s TV show Route 66.
Although Route 66 was retired as a US highway in 1985, more than 85% of the original 2,448-mile highway is still drivable, giving thousands of tourists each year the chance to take their own trip back in time.
One of those tourists was Google Doodle artist Matthew Cruickshank, who made the journey west in his 1972 Chevy Chevelle.
A video Doodle, released Friday, is his creation, essentially an animated sketchbook of the various historic sites he encountered along the way.
