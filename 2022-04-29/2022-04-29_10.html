     Biden administration creates Disinformation Governance Board
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Supporters say it will fend off Russian disinformation efforts.
It's part of a larger DHS effort to blunt Russian disinformation campaigns, but it would go further than that.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday announced the formation of a Disinformation Governance Board that the federal government claims will fight disinformation.
The Disinformation Governance Board will be instructed to help fend off any Russian disinformation campaigns related to the war in Ukraine or the U.S. midterm elections.
"That the Biden Admin casually announced today that the Dept of Homeland Security -- a domestic security agency -- has created a 'disinformation' board is indescribably dystopian and chilling," Greenwald wrote.

     White House Sets Up Monumentally Stupidly Named ‘Disinformation Governance Board’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is very easy to read “Disinformation Governance Board” and think it is some Orwellian government program designed to qualitatively analyze information in order to deem it either suitable to be expressed, or forbidden.
From the AP article about the board’s launching:A newly formed Disinformation Governance Board announced Wednesday will immediately begin focusing on misinformation aimed at migrants, a problem that has helped to fuel sudden surges at the U.S. southern border in recent years.
Meanwhile, the other thing that seems like it could be an interesting idea for a government “disinformation board” to do is simply to do more research into how and why disinformation has traction.
But everything about the way this Disinformation Governance Board has been rolled out has been a disaster.

     As Homeland Security tackles disinformation, the right balks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Department of Homeland Security has identified a problem, and officials are moving forward with plans to address that problem.
With another election season effectively underway in the United States, the Homeland Security board will also reportedly “monitor and prepare for Russian disinformation threats.”This doesn’t seem especially remarkable, either.
In fact, there’s ample precedent for this: The Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in 2018, and part of CISA’s purview was (and is) to combat misinformation and disinformation.
In other words, Homeland Security officials have recognized these informational threats before.
When Homeland Security officials raised concerns about potentially violent radicals, and their possible impact on public safety, quite a few conservatives quickly assumed that this described them.

     Disinformation Governance Board to tackle spread of misinformation in U.S., focusing on Russia and U.S.-Mexico border
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Department of Homeland Security is setting up a Disinformation Governance Board to try to counter the spread of false information.
The board will focus on disinformation coming from Russia as well as misleading messages about the U.S.-Mexico border, the Associated Press reports.
The immediate focus will be on misinformation from human smugglers, who spread false claims about U.S. border policy to migrants to help drum up business.
"The Russians engage in… very active disinformation, misinformation, and in fact information warfare as a key part of their arsenal," Wray told CBS News' Scott Pelley.
Recent disinformation from Russia includes the false claim last month that American National Guard troops were killed fighting in Ukraine.

     Summary: Local police have cordoned off the area and the National Guard has set up a perimeter at 15 miles.
DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told a House panel Wednesday that the governance board would counter the threat of misinformation and disinformation for elections and homeland security.
They're afraid that we might actually think for ourselves.”Spare a thought for Nina Jankowicz, who has stepped up to lead this effort at the Department of Homeland Security.
And there had to be a better name for it than the Disinformation Governance Board, a monicker that sounds as though it were made of steel, concrete, and barbed-wire.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadThe Department of Homeland Security’s creation of a Disinformation Governance Board has set off a backlash on the right — even as it’s not entirely clear what the perhaps unfortunately named board will do.
Choose your plan ArrowRight Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas mentioned the creation of the board in multiple congressional hearings this week.
“Congressman, the Disinformation Board addresses disinformation that imperils the safety and security of our homeland,” Mayorkas said.
🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/C4xiEGfhDt — Nina Jankowicz 🇺🇦🇺🇸 (@wiczipedia) April 27, 2022Which brings us back to the Disinformation Governance Board.
“It recants some of the language in their letter, which I never adopted.”Somewhat similarly, the name “Disinformation Governance Board” does sound a bit ominous; it sounds less like an effort to combat disinformation than to, well, govern it.
