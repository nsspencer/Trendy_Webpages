    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But his eye apparently never strayed far from the first company he’d ever reportedly applied to work for: DC Comics.
In the meantime, Adams picked up his first serious fan attention for his work on a less well-known hero, Deadman.
Adams, never politically shy, used also used his growing reputation to disrupt systems inside the comics industry that put much of the power in the hands of publishers.
But he remained, and remains, one of the gods of 20th century comics; an artist who didn’t just define the look of superhero comics, but also pushed back on assumptions of how the industry itself could, or should, run.
DC Comics penned a tribute to Adams earlier today, writing, “ With deep respect for Neal and his tireless work and great love for the comics industry, we extend our condolences to his family and friends.”

     Summary: Neal Adams, the legendary comic book artist who reinvigorated Batman and other superheroes with his photorealistic stylings and championed the rights of creators, has died.
Adams died Thursday in New York of complications from sepsis, his wife, Marilyn Adams, told The Hollywood Reporter.
“It was no secret that we were doing Batman right,” Adams said during a panel at San Diego Comic-Con in 2010.
“It was as if the memory of DC Comics went along with the statements that both Denny and I were making, that we want it to be more realistic, more gritty.
His three sons and Zeea all work as artists in the comic book or fantasy field.
