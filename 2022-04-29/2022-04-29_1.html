    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Timberwolves have been eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies; however, before Game 6 began, Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green had some constructive criticism for Karl Anthony-Towns.
Draymond then went on to say that he was surprised Towns was unable to exploit the Memphis Grizzlies defending him with Dillon Brooks at times.
Ty Lue did it in the play-in as well, and while the Clippers lost the game, KAT was a non-factor.
With the Wolves eliminated, it will now be Draymond Green and the Golden State Warriors taking on the Memphis Grizzlies.
