     6 best remaining players for the Chicago Bears after round 1 to draft Day 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a chaotic Round 1 of the 2022 NFL Draft, the Chicago Bears find themselves in a peculiar situation with the needs they have going into Day 2.
Six wide receivers were taken in Round 1, so what’s left for the Chicago Bears?
Jahan Dotson was the one receiver of the top six that I personally didn’t want on the Chicago Bears from receivers taken in the first round.
Luckily for them, teams that seemed like they’d pick a wide receiver in the first round (i.e.
That being said, there are still at least five remaining players after round one that the Chicago Bears could happily draft in Day 2.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bears didn’t have a selection in the first round so we are still waiting to see what a draft selection looks like from new general manager Ryan Poles.
Based on how round one went on Thursday, there is a lot to be excited about.
There was also a string of wide receivers taken in the first round which is not the best news.
The Chicago Bears need a good one really bad and now they are going to have a bit slimmer pickings than they originally thought.
There are still going to be a lot of good players available to the Chicago Bears.

     Summary: He played on the best defense in the entire country last season at Georgia and was arguably its best player.
He finished with the second-most tackles (72), second-most sacks (6), most tackles for a loss (10.5), and third-most interceptions (2) on the team.
Don’t forget this team already has Roquan Smith on the roster, a Pro Bowler in all but name.
Adding a talent like Dean alongside him threatens to create the best combination this team has seen since Brian Urlacher and Lance Briggs.
This is another case of teams overlooking evident football ability just because a guy doesn’t precisely fit the ideal measurables.

While it was a whirlwind of a first round, which included a slew of the nation’s top prospects off the board, there are some potential impact players still available ahead of Day 2.
Chicago didn’t have any picks in the first round, but they have a pair of second-round selections at 39th and 48th overall.
The team has a long list of positional needs beginning with cornerback, wide receiver, and offensive line.

     Summary: Bears general manager Ryan Poles said he won’t get “too cute” with his scouting of draft prospects.
They have to be able to do that.”What I think: In Darnell Mooney, the Bears have a receiver who fits what Poles is describing.
For the Bears, Eberflus’ insistence on finding “explosive, athletic ability” will factor into their board.
And, as Eberflus also explained, the versatility of players on the team and those in the draft will be measured.
If you listen to Eberflus, bad tacklers won’t fair well on the Bears’ draft board.
