He did lead Memphis' starters in defensive rating over the course of the series, in which he blocked 16 shots in six games.
Though he finished with only 17 points, Morant was once instrumental as the Grizzlies' floor general as they staged their fourth-quarter comeback.
After the game, Morant was visibly exhausted, as he placed his head down on the podium between testimonials about his teammates' contributions.
After some teasing from Bane, Morant expanded on his plans.

     Summary: MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Desmond Bane and Dillon Brooks each scored 23 points and the Memphis Grizzlies rallied yet again to eliminate the Minnesota Timberwolves, winning 114-106 in Game 6 on Friday night.
The Grizzlies advanced in the playoffs for the first time in seven years, this time to meet Golden State.
Jaden McDaniels had 24 points off the bench, and Karl-Anthony Towns added 18 points and 10 rebounds.
Bane then swished another one from deep at 3:03 for a 101-99 lead, the first for the Grizzlies since they were up 39-38.
The kill shot came soon after for a Wolves team that, like so many others against the Grizzlies this season, was consistently a step and a jump behind on the glass.
