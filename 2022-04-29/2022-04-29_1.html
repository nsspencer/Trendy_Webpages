     Summary: The fourth season has also become a family affair, adding a deeper hook to the Byrde saga that delivers tension right up until the last frame.
Julia Garner in 'Ozark.'
Similarly, the bifurcated season has explored the Byrdes' fractured alliance with Ruth (Julia Garner), while providing necessary reminders of the collateral damage done in their gradual descent into this world of illegality.
The performances are, again, sensational, with Garner standing out in a home stretch that showcases just how tough and determined Ruth can be.
Richard Thomas also plays a more significant role as Wendy's estranged father, who has come back into her life and, like almost everything else in "Ozark," complicated it.

     Summary: This story contains spoilers for Season Four, Part Two of Ozark.
If you think he's bad, maybe he'll change and you'll like him.
If you think back to just about everything Marty Byrde either did or said over the course of the series, Ozark seems to always hint that he might change.
Ozark could've written the finale so that even one Byrde would find redemption, but it didn't.
Ozark, clear as day, wants to show us that not only do we stay the same at our very core.

     How ‘Ozark’ Cinematography Put a ‘Sense of Danger in the Shadows’ for Season 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “When we started opening up the background, as you’ll see in part two, there’s a little bit more in focus, overall,” he explains.
“In terms of light, it’s mostly about denser shadows, elevated contrast — a bit more noir,” he says.
And then we introduce a little bit in there, balance it up a little bit to get a little bit of an edge to it so it’s not so stark, dark foreground and bright backgrounds.
It’s all about subtly shifting the viewer’s perspective.”With this being the final season, Kim says there was an impetus to add a kind of visual exclamation point.
Customarily, the world of “Ozark” has a rich cyan-filtered look to it, “almost monochromatic,” he says.

     Netflix's 'Ozark' ends as a thrilling, yet disappointing take on a criminal family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet, here I am, dissecting the complicated legacy of Netflix's Ozark, which drops its final seven episodes on the streamer today.
Shows which have as many plotlines in motion as Ozark can feel rushed in their final episodes as they plow through circumstances to reach the finish line.
The story 'Ozark' is really tellingThere are some big deaths in the series' finale (again, saying who would be a spoiler).
Ozark has a lot of in common with Breaking Bad, but one place where it diverges is in the impact of criminality on a family.
These actors and the wonderfully delicious circumstances producers put them in, kept me watching every second of every Ozark episode, even when aspects of show didn't quite meet the definition of exceptional TV.

     ‘Ozark’ Ending Tests the Meaning of a Netflix Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By now, some obsessive “Ozark” fans will have already plowed through the show’s final seven hour-long episodes, which appeared early Friday morning on Netflix.
“As a viewer, I love being able to immerse myself and keep going,” Mr. Mundy said.
Once, the series finale was the ultimate group ritual of TV fandom.
The end of “Ozark” raises the question: Does a long-awaited series finale have as much impact when fans don’t experience it in unison?
“There’s this feeling of, we’ve invested five years in this thing, so doing it together seems more substantive,” Mr. Mundy said.

     Summary: As Marty works the Mexican cartel, Wendy works the Ozarks, trying to keep her foundation alive by getting in Ruth’s way.
Does Marty know at this point that it’s likely he can’t leave Mexico without killing Arturo?
But Marty needs a confession and he needs to know who else was involved.
Wendy calls Clare, threatening that she shouldn’t make the people Wendy works for unhappy.
• Jonah’s line about why he works for Ruth made me laugh for some reason: “We’re friends.
