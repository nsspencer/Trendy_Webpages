     Alfonso Herrera, 'Javi' on 'Ozark,' reflects as final season debuts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The end is weighing heavy on Mexican actor Alfonso Herrera.
The unease doesn’t stem from aging or global catastrophes but rather from sharing with the world the final season of Netflix’s popular crime drama, "Ozark," released on Friday.
Alfonso Herrera as Javi and Felix Solis as Omar Navarro in a scene from "Ozark."
From there, he began booking steady television work in Mexico City, including the Latin American phenomenon that was "Rebelde."
Jason Bateman as Martin 'Marty' Byrde, Alfonso Herrera as Javi in an episode of "Ozark."

     How ‘Ozark’ Cinematography Put a ‘Sense of Danger in the Shadows’ for Season 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “When we started opening up the background, as you’ll see in part two, there’s a little bit more in focus, overall,” he explains.
“In terms of light, it’s mostly about denser shadows, elevated contrast — a bit more noir,” he says.
And then we introduce a little bit in there, balance it up a little bit to get a little bit of an edge to it so it’s not so stark, dark foreground and bright backgrounds.
It’s all about subtly shifting the viewer’s perspective.”With this being the final season, Kim says there was an impetus to add a kind of visual exclamation point.
Customarily, the world of “Ozark” has a rich cyan-filtered look to it, “almost monochromatic,” he says.

     Netflix's 'Ozark' ends as a thrilling, yet disappointing take on a criminal family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet, here I am, dissecting the complicated legacy of Netflix's Ozark, which drops its final seven episodes on the streamer today.
Shows which have as many plotlines in motion as Ozark can feel rushed in their final episodes as they plow through circumstances to reach the finish line.
The story 'Ozark' is really tellingThere are some big deaths in the series' finale (again, saying who would be a spoiler).
Ozark has a lot of in common with Breaking Bad, but one place where it diverges is in the impact of criminality on a family.
These actors and the wonderfully delicious circumstances producers put them in, kept me watching every second of every Ozark episode, even when aspects of show didn't quite meet the definition of exceptional TV.
