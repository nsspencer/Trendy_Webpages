     Summary: The Minnesota Timberwolves have been eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies; however, before Game 6 began, Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green had some constructive criticism for Karl Anthony-Towns.
Draymond then went on to say that he was surprised Towns was unable to exploit the Memphis Grizzlies defending him with Dillon Brooks at times.
Ty Lue did it in the play-in as well, and while the Clippers lost the game, KAT was a non-factor.
With the Wolves eliminated, it will now be Draymond Green and the Golden State Warriors taking on the Memphis Grizzlies.

Desmond Bane and Dillon Brooks each scored 23 points and the Grizzlies rallied yet again to eliminate the Timberwolves, winning 114-106 in Game 6 on Friday night.
The kill shot came soon after for a Wolves team that, like so many others against the Grizzlies this season, was consistently a step and a jump behind on the glass.
Former Timberwolves star Latrell Sprewell sat courtside, a few seats down from Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen, a Minnesota native.
