     Republicans are hellbent on kicking Madison Cawthorn out for good
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Thursday evening, the Daily Mail published screenshots of a video of Representative Madison Cawthorn with his staffer Stephen Smith putting his hand on the congressman’s crotch.
First, many Republicans never really liked Cawthorn in the first place (as I wrote in a feature earlier this month).
“There are a lot of good Republican legislators out there that have done a lot of good,” this person said.
Then there’s the fact that Cawthorn picked a fight with the North Carolina Republican establishment.
All these actions mean Republicans just need to keep shoveling till they finally pile up enough extra dirt.

     Timeline of Madison Cawthorn controversies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Madison Cawthorn ( R-N.C.) has been a lightning rod for controversy.
And Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) on Wednesday called for a House Ethics Committee investigation into Cawthorn over allegations of insider trading.
The Asheville Citizen Times reported that Cawthorn was facing three citations for incidents occurring across three counties in North Carolina.
“Insider trading by a member of Congress is a serious betrayal of their oath, and Congressman Cawthorn owes North Carolinians an explanation.
Tillis has come out in support of a primary challenger to Cawthorn, state Sen. Chuck Edwards (R), in recent weeks.
