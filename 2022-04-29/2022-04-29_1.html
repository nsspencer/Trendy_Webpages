Julia Garner in 'Ozark.'
The performances are, again, sensational, with Garner standing out in a home stretch that showcases just how tough and determined Ruth can be.
“Ozark” deftly builds toward that answer, delivering it in a thought-provoking way that cements its place among Netflix’s finest dramas.

     How ‘Ozark’ Cinematography Put a ‘Sense of Danger in the Shadows’ for Season 4
    </h2>

     Summary: “When we started opening up the background, as you’ll see in part two, there’s a little bit more in focus, overall,” he explains.
“In terms of light, it’s mostly about denser shadows, elevated contrast — a bit more noir,” he says.
And then we introduce a little bit in there, balance it up a little bit to get a little bit of an edge to it so it’s not so stark, dark foreground and bright backgrounds.
It’s all about subtly shifting the viewer’s perspective.”With this being the final season, Kim says there was an impetus to add a kind of visual exclamation point.
Customarily, the world of “Ozark” has a rich cyan-filtered look to it, “almost monochromatic,” he says.

     Netflix's 'Ozark' ends as a thrilling, yet disappointing take on a criminal family
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet, here I am, dissecting the complicated legacy of Netflix's Ozark, which drops its final seven episodes on the streamer today.
Shows which have as many plotlines in motion as Ozark can feel rushed in their final episodes as they plow through circumstances to reach the finish line.
The story 'Ozark' is really tellingThere are some big deaths in the series' finale (again, saying who would be a spoiler).
Ozark has a lot of in common with Breaking Bad, but one place where it diverges is in the impact of criminality on a family.
These actors and the wonderfully delicious circumstances producers put them in, kept me watching every second of every Ozark episode, even when aspects of show didn't quite meet the definition of exceptional TV.
