I also felt the way the album lays out, it feels very whole, but there are different moods in there that were going to suit what we shot.

Similarly, the bifurcated season has explored the Byrdes' fractured alliance with Ruth (Julia Garner), while providing necessary reminders of the collateral damage done in their gradual descent into this world of illegality.
The performances are, again, sensational, with Garner standing out in a home stretch that showcases just how tough and determined Ruth can be.
Richard Thomas also plays a more significant role as Wendy's estranged father, who has come back into her life and, like almost everything else in "Ozark," complicated it.

     Summary: I enjoyed him, I really enjoyed Javi.
On the contrary, I was – and that's why it's so fun to play Javi, because the possibilities are, it's so unpredictable.
He's so unpredictable that I did five or six takes, different from each one another, and each option could fit in.
I really enjoyed Javi, and I really laughed reading the script.
It's the appeal of a magnetic yet dangerous predator, the unpredictable force that menaces the protagonists with aplomb.

     Summary: And yet, here I am, dissecting the complicated legacy of Netflix's Ozark, which drops its final seven episodes on the streamer today.
Shows which have as many plotlines in motion as Ozark can feel rushed in their final episodes as they plow through circumstances to reach the finish line.
The story 'Ozark' is really tellingThere are some big deaths in the series' finale (again, saying who would be a spoiler).
Ozark has a lot of in common with Breaking Bad, but one place where it diverges is in the impact of criminality on a family.
These actors and the wonderfully delicious circumstances producers put them in, kept me watching every second of every Ozark episode, even when aspects of show didn't quite meet the definition of exceptional TV.
