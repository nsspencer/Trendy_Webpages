     Chicago Bears Mock Draft: Rounds 4 though 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This Chicago Bears finally got to participate in the 2022 NFL Draft and it went like no one expected.
The board seemed to line up well for the Bears, both at wide receiver and for a possible trade down, but general manager Ryan Poles went defense with his first two picks.
He then got a wide out that many fans never thought would be an option in the third round.
and receiver on his first night picking prospects, so I rectified that in my mock by targeting some big guys.
What positions do you think the Bears will address on day 3?

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft kicked off on Friday night, it was all about a few key positions of need for the Chicago Bears.
39 overall, the Chicago Bears solidified their cornerback position by selecting Washington cornerback Kyler Gordon.
If this cornerback room is healthy, then the Chicago Bears completely renovated that position with a matter of two particular players.
Kyler Gordon immediately makes the Chicago Bears’ cornerback room one to reckon with.
The Chicago Bears got someone who will be able to read the quarterback in a hurry, but make a move immediately once he understands where the ball is going.

     Summary: Drafting cornerback Kyler Gordon, safety Jalen Brisker and wide receiver Velus Jones addressed three Bears needs but GM Ryan Poles has plenty of other spots yet to fill.
Make no mistake, the three players drafted Friday by the Bears in Rounds 2 and 3 of the 2022 NFL Draft will help.
They're responsible, dependable," Bears GM Ryan Poles said.
Jones has elite speed after running 4.31 seconds in the 40 at the combine, second fastest time for any receiver.
At 6-foot, 204 and with such speed, Poles had to invoke the name everyone wants to throw around these days when they pick a receiver: Deebo, as in Samuel.
