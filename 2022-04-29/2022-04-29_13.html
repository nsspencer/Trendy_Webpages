     NFL Draft: Bengals plan to let Daxton Hill blitz quarterbacks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Michigan safety Daxton Hill is now playing for a team that just appeared in a Super Bowl — the Cincinnati Bengals.
Hill was selected at the tail end of the first round, the Bengals selected him with the No.
We’re really, really fired up to get him in the building.”ESPN NFL Draft analyst Mel Kiper was just as surprised as Taylor, who felt Hill should have been drafted much sooner in the first round.
Daxton Hill, to me, one of the steals in the draft so far.
It’s ironic how we could’ve won the Super Bowl last year, but my upside can be important to the team,” Hill said.
