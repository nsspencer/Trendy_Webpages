     Who is Patriots second-round draft pick Tyquan Thornton?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots keep building around second-year quarterback Mac Jones.
After drafting offensive lineman Cole Strange with their first-round pick on Thursday, they added a speedy wide receiver in Round 2.
50, the Patriots ended up picking Tyquan Thornton out of Baylor.
The Patriots’ only true need at the wide receiver position was a developmental X — something they addressed by drafting Thornton.
One-sentence verdict: The Patriots spoke about adding speed to their team earlier during the offseason, and few players in this year’s draft are faster than Thornton.

     Grading the Patriots drafting Baylor WR Tyquan Thornton in Round 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots are taking another swing at the speedy, outside receiver that they have lacked for so many years.
No one expects the Patriots’ second-round pick Tyquan Thornton to be Moss.
Surely, that’s what the Patriots are hoping by grabbing the speedster receiver in the second round after trading up to get him.
His 3-cone drill underwhelmed (7.25 seconds), which is interesting — because that’s usually the Patriots’ favorite barometer for receivers.
But that’s the type of player the Patriots like to chase in Round 2.
