     Shining Girls review – Elisabeth Moss is perfect for this time-hopping thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But I would urge, even if that is your current position, to give Shining Girls (Apple TV+) a try, though the premise may be unalluring.
Moss is, as ever, ferociously intense and attentive to the minutest shift in her character’s mood or suffering.
When you add Moss’s remarkable, nuanced performance to the slightly slow pacing and the audience being arguably too far ahead of the protagonists, Shining Girls works better as a character study than a thriller (though it’s certainly worth watching as the latter).
One reality is replaced by another and another and another as you take two steps forwards and one back towards a new normality.
Even as the female victim count adds up, Shining Girls keeps its integrity and never backs away from this underlying truth.

     Shining Girls Offers Twist on Serial Killer Genre
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And what about the matchbook found in Kirby from a place that doesn’t exist ... yet.
“Shining Girls” is a thematic treasure trove in how it unpacks the reality-shifted impact of trauma and Moss is more than up to the challenge of a tough role like this one.
Moss is simply one of the best actresses of her generation, the kind of performer who can sell a premise as out-there as this one.
She’s ably balanced by Jamie Bell, who does some of the best work of his career in a truly menacing, terrifying performance.
If there’s a problem with “Shining Girls,” and it’s kind of a big problem, this is yet another one of those projects that I wish was made a decade ago as a feature film.

     Elisabeth Moss’ New Serial Killer Show Loses the Hit Book’s Key Feature
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The serial killer thriller has always been a sketchy genre, hovering in the disreputable margin between murder mystery and horror.
As Beukes’ novel conceived them, his victims are “shining girls,” women of unusual potential.
The Shining Girls is that rare serial killer thriller in which the victims out-glow the killer, but none of these rich stories makes it into the miniseries.
In a scene from the miniseries, Kirby and Dan pore over police records and crime photos, looking for other victims of Harper.
This makes for a serviceable supernatural thriller, but this reader, for one, can’t help mourning the loss of all those shining girls.

     Summary: ​​Warning: Spoilers ahead for the AppleTV+ series Shining GirlsAfter reading Lauren Beukes’s 2013 psychological thriller Shining Girls, Silka Luisa knew she had to try and turn it into a TV show.
“You can never change the intention of the book,” the creator, writer, and producer of Shining Girls said.
Making the series more Kirby-centricBeukes’ novel Shining Girls centers on Harper, a time-traveling Depression-era drifter who murders “shining girls,” women who burn bright with potential, in order to survive.
Before Luisa even started writing the Shining Girls pilot five years ago, she knew she wanted to filter the story through Kirby.
His humanness made him almost more unsettling.”Read More: There’s an Ingenious Method in Shining Girls’ Mind-Bending MadnessMaking sense of timeUnderstanding how time works on Shining Girls isn’t always easy, especially since the mechanics of it differ slightly from the book.
