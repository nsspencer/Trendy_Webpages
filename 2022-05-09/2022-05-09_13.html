     Biden signs bill that aims to streamline U.S. military aid to Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. President Joe Biden signs into law S. 3522, the "Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022" at the White House in Washington, May 9, 2022.
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed a bill Monday that will streamline the lengthy process of supplying Ukraine with the military equipment needed for the fight against Russia.
"The cost of the fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression is even more costly," Biden added.
Biden's signature on the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 will make it easier for the U.S. to lend or lease military aid to allies affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Biden already has some power to lend or lease equipment, but the legislation he will sign into law will ease some of the requirements for doing so.

     Biden announces partnership with internet providers to lower costs for low-income households
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden on Monday announced that 20 of the nation's internet providers have committed to lowering costs for low-income households, a step the administration says will increase access to high-speed internet for 48 million households nationwide.
"Over the last few months, my administration has worked closely with internet providers.
The announcement follows provisions in the administration's bipartisan infrastructure law to subsidize wireless internet for low-income families under the Affordable Connectivity Program, which reduces internet service costs for eligible families by up to $30 a month through grant funding.
Biden thanked the participating providers -- which include national names like AT&amp;T, Comcast, Frontier, Spectrum and Verizon, as well as more local providers such as Jackson Energy Authority and Ideatek.
The President said participating providers cover about 80% of the US population.

     Biden Speeds Up Military Aid to Ukraine, Drawing U.S. Deeper Into War
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Putin is still telling people outside Europe this is just a repeat of the Cold War, nothing to look at here.
“But saying it out loud helps his public narrative that Russia is fighting the U.S. and NATO in Ukraine, not just the Ukrainians.
No one in Washington really knows the line that should not be crossed with Mr. Putin, and instead the United States has simply been making assumptions.
“Because I rather think we are.”The consequence, he added, is being too slow to provide what Ukraine really needs.
“They’ve done amazingly well at making stuff happen in a relatively timely fashion,” Mr. Kagan said of the Biden administration.

     Summary: Previously, I had recommended that Congress take overdue action on much needed funding for COVID treatments, vaccines and tests, as part of the Ukraine Supplemental bill.
Without timely COVID funding, more Americans will die needlessly.
In addition, our effort to help lower-income countries get COVID vaccines into arms will stall.
So I call on Congress to pass the Ukrainian Supplemental funding bill immediately, and get it to my desk in the next few days.
And then, I urge Congress to move promptly on the COVID funding bill.

     Summary: AdvertisementThe House passed the lend-lease bill last month on a 417-to-10 vote.
The measure, introduced by a bipartisan group of senators, updates a 1941 law the United States used to help its allies during World War II.
“The Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 revives this pivotal program, waiving time-consuming requirements on the president’s authority to send critical defensive resources to Ukraine,” she said.
There, they met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, who thanked the United States for “helping to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity” of his country.
President Biden on April 28 proposed legislation for the United States to provide additional funding to support Ukraine in its defense from Russia’s invasion.

Speaking in Washington DC on Monday, Biden described the Russian president as "a very calculating man" but without an exit strategy and admitted "I'm trying to figure out what we do about that".
He said Mr Putin had mistakenly believed the invasion of Ukraine would break up NATO and the European Union.
During a speech marking Europe Day in Strasbourg, France, President Macron said he feared the process would take "decades".

High-speed Internet is not a luxury any longer, it’s a necessity.
So they go without high-speed Internet or they sacrifice other necessities in order to make it work.
That’s why — that’s why, in November, when we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, we also created something called the Affordable Connectivity Program.
More than 65 million Americans live in a place with only one high-speed Internet provider.
