     Eagles depth chart following the 2022 NFL Draft: Offense edition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Free agency and the NFL Draft are behind us so let’s take a look at how the Philadelphia Eagles’ 2022 projected depth chart is coming together.
Minshew is the QB2 unless some team blows the Eagles away with a trade offer.
It’s always possible the Eagles re-sign JoHo, though it might be worth noting they already gave out his No.
Reagor really shouldn’t be on the team considering how he’s not helping on offense and he doesn’t provide special teams value.
If all goes to the Eagles’ plan, Jurgens won’t play a single snap in 2022.
