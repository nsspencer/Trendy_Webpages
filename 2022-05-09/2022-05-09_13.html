     Mario Batali Goes on Trial in Sexual Misconduct Case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mario Batali, once considered the best-known celebrity chef in the United States, went on trial Monday in Boston on charges of indecent battery and assault connected to what began as a selfie session in a Boston bar in 2017.
Several prominent chefs and restaurateurs have been accused of sexual harassment and abuse since the #MeToo movement spread into the world of restaurants and hospitality in the fall of 2017, but Mr. Batali is the only one who has faced criminal charges.
If convicted, he could face up to two and a half years in the Suffolk County House of Correction and be required to register as a sex offender.
Jury selection had been scheduled to begin on Monday, but in the morning Mr. Batali told Judge James Stanton that he would waive his right to a jury trial and instead leave the verdict to the judge, The Boston Globe reported.
Testimony was underway by midmorning.

     Mario Batali accuser testifies she felt confused and powerless to stop chef
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Massachusetts woman who accused Mario Batali of kissing and groping her while attempting to take a selfie at a Boston restaurant testified Monday that she felt confused and powerless to do anything to stop the celebrity chef.
The trial opened Monday after Batali, perhaps surprisingly, waived his right to a jury trial and opted instead to have a judge decide his fate.
The woman also testified that she felt embarrassed by the 2017 incident – until she saw other women step forward to share similar encounters with Batali.
The 61-year-old was once a Food Network fixture on shows like Molto Mario and Iron Chef America.
Batali has since been bought out of his stake in Eataly, which still has dozens of locations worldwide, including in Boston and New York City.

     Woman tells trial that celebrity chef Mario Batali groped her at Boston bar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrity chef Mario Batali is seated at Boston Municipal Court during the first day of his trial on a criminal charge that he forcibly groped and kissed a woman at a restaurant in 2017, in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. May 9, 2022.
BOSTON, May 9 (Reuters) - A teary Boston-area software worker on Monday testified that celebrity chef Mario Batali groped and squeezed her "sensitive feminine areas" five years ago at a Boston bar while posing with her for "selfie" photographs.
While the case had been set for a jury trial, Batali waived his right to one and elected to have Judge James Stanton decide his guilt or innocence.
He denied allegations of sexual assault but apologized for "deeply inappropriate" behavior.
"She wanted to get a celebrity picture with a celebrity chef, the defendant," Assistant District Attorney Nina Bonelli said in her opening statement.

     Accuser testifies in Mario Batali sexual misconduct trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Local Accuser testifies in Mario Batali sexual misconduct trial “This happened to me and this is my life,” the woman said on the stand.
While being questioned by prosecutors at Batali’s sexual misconduct trial, the 32-year-old said he appeared drunk and was slurring his words and closing his eyes as they took multiple photos together at his insistence.
The trial opened Monday after Batali — in a surprise move — waived his right to a jury trial and opted instead to have a judge decide his fate.
The 61-year-old was once a Food Network fixture on shows like “Molto Mario” and “Iron Chef America.” But the ponytail-and-orange Croc-wearing personality’s high-flying career crumbled amid sexual misconduct allegations.
I take full responsibility.”Last year, Batali, his business partner and their New York City restaurant company agreed to pay $600,000 to resolve a four-year investigation by the New York attorney general’s office into allegations that Batali, restaurant managers and other workers sexually harassed employees.

     Mario Batali’s Trial for Sexual Misconduct Allegations Begins in Boston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Restaurateur and celebrity chef Mario Batali goes on trial in Boston this week for sexual misconduct allegations dating back to 2017, involving an alleged incident at now-closed Back Bay restaurant Towne Stove and Spirits.
A 2018 report by Eater NY detailed this and other claims by several different women that Batali inappropriately touched them.
The 2018 reporting of the incident at Towne Stove and Spirits was a followup to Eater NY’s initial report in 2017 detailing at least two decades of alleged sexual misconduct by Batali.
The alleged incident at Towne involved Batali suggesting that he and a woman take selfies together after she recognized him at the restaurant.
By early 2019, Batali had divested from all his restaurants.
