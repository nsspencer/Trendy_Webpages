     Report: Nuggets’ Nikola Jokic wins second straight NBA MVP award
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Nuggets center has won his second straight NBA Most Valuable Player Award, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Monday morning.
Jokic averaged 27.1 points (sixth in NBA), 13.8 rebounds (second in NBA) and 7.9 assists (eighth in NBA) during the regular season.
Jokic and the Nuggets went through the regular season without two of their top players.
Still, Jokic powered the Nuggets to a 48-34 regular season record and the No.
By winning the honor, Jokic became the 15th player in NBA history to earn multiple MVPs and the 13th to earn MVPs in consecutive seasons.

     Nuggets star Nikola Jokic makes history, named back-to-back NBA MVP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic was named NBA MVP for the 2021-2022 season on Monday, making him the 13th back-to-back MVP in league history.
Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic has been voted the NBA’s Most Valuable Player for a second consecutive season, sources tell ESPN.
It truly is one of the best individual sports stories (if not the best) in Colorado history.
The Nuggets were defeated by the Golden State Warriors 4-1 in the first-round of the Western Conference playoffs, despite having the best player in the world on their side.
Next up is getting healthy and getting him some help, as The Joker once again reigns supreme as the top player in the NBA.

     Nuggets Center Nikola Jokic to Win Second Straight MVP, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nuggets center Nikola Jokic has been voted the NBA’s Most Valuable Player for a second consecutive season, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.
Jokic will become just the 13th player in the history of the NBA to win back-to-back MVP awards.
In addition, Jokic is the 14th player in league history to win multiple league MVPs.
In addition to posting some of the best numbers of his career this season, Jokic now also stands alone with his counting stats in three major categories.
Jokic edged out 76ers star center Joel Embiid, who had a phenomenal season in his own right.

     Summary: Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN:Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic has been voted the NBA’s Most Valuable Player for a second consecutive season, sources tell ESPN.
The Nuggets with Jokic, 76ers with Embiid and Bucks with Antetokounmpo each performed at similar levels with their stars on the court in the regular season.
Despite Jamal Murray missing the entire season and Michael Porter Jr. unhelpful/sidelined all year, Jokic lifted Denver to a 48-34 record.
Jokic was uniquely excellent – the best-passing center of all-time, a highly efficient scorer from all levels and an improved defender.
Unfounded rumors last week Embiid would be named MVP only add to the disapointment.

     Nuggets' Nikola Jokic to win second consecutive MVP, league source confirms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jokic will be named league MVP for the second consecutive season, a league source confirmed Monday, becoming only the fifth center to win in back-to-back years and only the 13th player in NBA history to earn the award in consecutive seasons.
Jokic learned he’d won the award on Monday, the source said, and a formal announcement is expected later this week.
In 39 of his 74 games this season, Jokic led the Nuggets in points, rebounds and assists.
At the All-Star Game in Cleveland, Jokic found a shrewd way to handle the mounting attention as his second MVP campaign grew.
I’m just trying to win the game.”While Nuggets coach Michael Malone and every one of his teammates stumped for his MVP candidacy, Jokic never once campaigned for it.

     Summary: Nikola Jokic has won the 2021-22 NBA MVP award, taking the league's top individual honor for the second consecutive year, per ESPN.
Aside from assists, Jokic managed to improve upon his per-game averages in every major statistical category in the regular season.
The race between Jokic, Embiid and Antetokounmpo was a fierce one.
Embiid won the scoring title by averaging 30.6 points.
He is the only Nugget to win an NBA MVP award, though Spencer Haywood won an ABA MVP award when the team was still known as the Denver Rockets.
