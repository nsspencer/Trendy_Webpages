     Report: Nuggets’ Nikola Jokic wins second straight NBA MVP award
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Nuggets center has won his second straight NBA Most Valuable Player Award, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Monday morning.
Jokic averaged 27.1 points (sixth in NBA), 13.8 rebounds (second in NBA) and 7.9 assists (eighth in NBA) during the regular season.
Jokic and the Nuggets went through the regular season without two of their top players.
Still, Jokic powered the Nuggets to a 48-34 regular season record and the No.
By winning the honor, Jokic became the 15th player in NBA history to earn multiple MVPs and the 13th to earn MVPs in consecutive seasons.

     NBA MVP: Sixers' Joel Embiid finishes behind Nikola Jokic in voting, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MVP is reportedly not in the cards for Joel Embiid this season.
The NBA’s scoring champion finished behind Nikola Jokic in voting for the award for a second straight season, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Monday morning.
In addition to Jokic and Embiid, two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo was the other finalist.
Jokic had another incredible season as the Nuggets’ do-everything big man, leading Denver to 48 wins despite Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. combining to play nine games.
From big man to big man, I’m happy.

     Nuggets Center Nikola Jokic to Win Second Straight MVP, per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nuggets center Nikola Jokic has been voted the NBA’s Most Valuable Player for a second consecutive season, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.
Jokic will become just the 13th player in the history of the NBA to win back-to-back MVP awards.
In addition, Jokic is the 14th player in league history to win multiple league MVPs.
In addition to posting some of the best numbers of his career this season, Jokic now also stands alone with his counting stats in three major categories.
Jokic edged out 76ers star center Joel Embiid, who had a phenomenal season in his own right.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN:Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic has been voted the NBA’s Most Valuable Player for a second consecutive season, sources tell ESPN.
The Nuggets with Jokic, 76ers with Embiid and Bucks with Antetokounmpo each performed at similar levels with their stars on the court in the regular season.
Despite Jamal Murray missing the entire season and Michael Porter Jr. unhelpful/sidelined all year, Jokic lifted Denver to a 48-34 record.
Jokic was uniquely excellent – the best-passing center of all-time, a highly efficient scorer from all levels and an improved defender.
Unfounded rumors last week Embiid would be named MVP only add to the disapointment.

     Summary: ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski first reported that Jokic would be named MVP again.
“It’s just remarkable what he’s done,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone recently said of Jokic.
There’s other great players, I’m not saying they’re not great players, but what Nikola Jokic has done this year, with this team, with everything that we’ve had to go through, is incredible.
“There’s nothing more important” than keeping Jokic, Nuggets president of basketball operations Tim Connelly recently said.
After being knocked out of the playoffs — he averaged 31 points, 13.2 rebounds — Jokic was asked how he might celebrate should he win MVP.
