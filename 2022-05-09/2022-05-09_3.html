    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nuggets center Nikola Jokic has been voted the NBA‚Äôs Most Valuable Player for a second consecutive season, according to ESPN‚Äôs Adrian Wojnarowski.
Jokic will become just the 13th player in the history of the NBA to win back-to-back MVP awards.
In addition, Jokic is the 14th player in league history to win multiple league MVPs.

Jokic edged out 76ers star center Joel Embiid, who had a phenomenal season in his own right.

     Nuggets' Nikola Jokic to win second consecutive MVP, league source confirms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jokic will be named league MVP for the second consecutive season, a league source confirmed Monday, becoming only the fifth center to win in back-to-back years and only the 13th player in NBA history to earn the award in consecutive seasons.
Jokic learned he‚Äôd won the award on Monday, the source said, and a formal announcement is expected later this week.
In 39 of his 74 games this season, Jokic led the Nuggets in points, rebounds and assists.
At the All-Star Game in Cleveland, Jokic found a shrewd way to handle the mounting attention as his second MVP campaign grew.
I‚Äôm just trying to win the game.‚ÄùWhile Nuggets coach Michael Malone and every one of his teammates stumped for his MVP candidacy, Jokic never once campaigned for it.
