     Why Another, Smaller Crypto Is Partly to Blame as Bitcoin Prices Plunge to Yearly Lows
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cryptocurrency market analysts are looking around for where to lay the blame as Bitcoin prices plunge on Monday.
Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks is certainly a major factor.
Cryptos have tumbled in tandem with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes as investors fret over the possibility of a U.S. recession amid rising interest rates and the highest inflation in decades.

     Bitcoin’s value nears $30,000 mark as Luna Foundation Guard liquidates wallet – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are two main factors driving pressure on bitcoin prices right now, Caleb Franzen, senior market analyst at Cubic Analytics, said to TechCrunch.
Terraform Labs (TFL) — the organization behind UST, cryptocurrency LUNA, and Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) — emptied its treasury wallet of all of its bitcoin, about 42,530 bitcoin, or $1.3 billion, today.
The depegging of UST is forcing LFG to liquidate reserves from both LUNA and bitcoin in order to correct the pegging of UST to $1, Franzen said.
But UST is designed to withstand shocks because it’s an algorithmic stablecoin, Twitter user stablechen, a Terra developer, tweeted.
“With the LFG essentially forced to liquidate BTC to stabilize the stablecoin, we have a major institution dumping thousands of BTC into the market,” Franzen said.

     Summary: At a price of just below $31,000, bitcoin is more than 50% below its record high of near $69,000 from late last year and at its lowest point since July 2021.
But he added that "bitcoin is not immune to the global inflation risk spreading across most other asset classes.
That's bad news for bitcoin too, as many crypto backers point to dollar weakness as a bullish sign for digital currencies.
As rates (and the dollar) continue to climb, some crypto skeptics think the selling in bitcoin has only just begun.
The massive pullback in these and other momentum tech stocks is yet another sign of the rapid shift in the market's mood this year.

     Ethereum and Bitcoin Prices Are Tanking. Here’s Why One Expert Thinks Bitcoin Could Drop Even Lower

     Summary: Bitcoin and ethereum have dropped more than 10% over the last 24 hours, with bitcoin going below $30,000 for the first time since July 2021 and ethereum trading near $2,200.
Cryptocurrency Prices Today: Bitcoin, EthereumIt’s been a shaky start to the week for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, largely driven by ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.
Ethereum is down 18% over the past week amid a big retreat in Bitcoin and the stock market.
If Bitcoin is falling in price, ethereum is likely falling, too.
If it seems like the crypto market has been acting increasingly like the stock market lately, it’s because it has been.
