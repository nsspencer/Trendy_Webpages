     Summary: Payne signed with Michigan State as a five-star prospect out of Dayton, Ohio, in 2010 over offers from Arizona, Cincinnati and Dayton.
Payne at Michigan State became a star on the court, where he twice earned All-Big Ten honors.
He also developed a bond with Lacey Holsworth, a young Michigan State fan who had terminal cancer.
In the wake of the 2018 ESPN report which detailed inaction and denial related to sexual assault cases at Michigan State -- including an incident involving Appling and Payne -- Michigan State president Lou Anna Simon resigned from her post.
In the years after leaving the NBA, Payne continued his pursuit of a professional career, playing overseas with several teams.

     Summary: Adreian Payne, the former NBA first-round draft pick whose friendship with a young cancer patient during his senior season at Michigan State University made national headlines in 2014, was fatally shot Monday morning in central Florida, authorities said.

After Michigan State, where he averaged 16 points and seven rebounds per game during his senior season, Payne was selected with the 15th pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the Atlanta Hawks.
