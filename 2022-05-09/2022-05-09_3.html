     Jill Biden visits Ukraine, making her first solo trip to a combat zone as first lady

     Summary: Updated May 8, 2022 at 10:11 AM ETFirst lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine Sunday and met with the country's first lady, Olena Zelenska.
It was the first time a U.S. first lady has traveled solo to a combat zone since 2015, when Michelle Obama visited Qatar's al-Udeid Air Base.
Biden crossed the Slovakia-Ukraine border after a visit to the Slovakia side of a border crossing in Vysne Nemecke.
Biden and Zelenska met at a school that has been converted into a shelter for internally displaced Ukrainians.
The first lady's visit to Ukraine was not announced ahead of time, and was not on Biden's public schedule.

     Summary: Jill Biden spent several hours in Ukraine, driving from the border with Slovakia to a town 10 minutes away to see first lady Olena Zelenska on Mother's DayUZHHOROD, Ukraine -- Jill Biden made an unannounced visit to western Ukraine, holding a surprise Mother’s Day meeting with first lady Olena Zelenska to show U.S. support for the embattled nation as Russia presses its punishing war in the eastern regions.
The women stepped out of their vehicles and embraced, with Biden — who wore a wrist corsage for Mother's Day — handing over a bouquet of flowers before they entered the school.
The visit allowed Biden to conduct the kind of personal diplomacy that her husband would like to do himself.
Her visit was to western Ukraine; Russia is concentrating its military power in eastern Ukraine, and she was not in harm’s way.
She spent Friday and Saturday in Romania, visiting with U.S. troops and meeting with Ukrainian refugee mothers and children.

     Jill Biden’s secret Ukraine trip
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They reached out several days before Biden’s planned four-day tour of Eastern Europe to suggest a meeting with Zelenska in Ukraine, according to Michael LaRosa, the first lady’s spokesman.
She wrote to Biden in April, expressing her concerns for the emotional well-being of the citizens of Ukraine, LaRosa said.
The visit made Biden the latest high-profile person close to Joe Biden to travel to Ukraine.
While he visited troops near the border with Ukraine, he stopped short of entering the country because of security concerns.
Shortly after she departed the school in Ukraine, the first lady called her husband, who was home in Wilmington, Delaware, from her motorcade.

     Day after visiting Ukraine, Jill Biden meets with Slovakian president
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First lady Jill Biden wrapped up her four-day trip to eastern Europe Monday by meeting with Slovakian President Zuzana Caputova in Bratislava, Slovakia.
LaRosa described their conversation as “more of a personal mother-to-mother exchange” and said Jill Biden was interested in how Zalenska was coping “through that lens.”He said Zalenska told Jill Biden that she was able to hold her children's hands every night even though she could not be with her husband.
“I cannot explain because I don’t know myself and I’m a teacher,” Victorie Kutocha, who had her arms around her 7-year-old daughter, Yulie, told Jill Biden.
Jill Biden also dropped in at a Slovakian public school that has taken in displaced students.
Slovakian and Ukrainian moms were brought together at the school for a Mother’s Day event while their children made crafts to give them as gifts.
