     New York Islanders fire head coach Barry Trotz after four seasons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The New York Islanders have relieved Barry Trotz of his coaching duties after four seasons with the club, Islanders President and General Manager Lou Lamoriello announced Monday.
The Islanders missed the Stanley Cup playoffs this past season after finishing with a 37-35-10 record.
"It will be a tremendous understatement to say that this was not an easy decision to make," Lamoriello said in a statement to NHL.com"Unfortunately it is my role to make the best decisions for the organization going forward and I believe that this group of players needs a new voice and this in no way is anything negative on Barry Trotz, who as each and every one of you knows is a tremendous human being."
The Islanders qualified for the postseason in Trotz's first three seasons.
The Isles advanced to the Eastern Conference finals in 2020 and 2021 but came up short both times to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning.

     Islanders fire Barry Trotz in shock move: ‘This group of players needs a new voice’

     Summary: “It is my role to make the best decisions for the organization going forward and I believe that this group of players needs a new voice.
This season was an immensely difficult one for both Trotz and the Islanders.
Meanwhile, the Islanders limped to a 37-35-10 record (84 points) to finish fifth in the Metropolitan Division.
“We’re very appreciative of that… These types of decisions are made for going forward, not for the backward.
With this group we have — and they’re on notice right now — that new voice is necessary to have success… My opinion is what makes these decisions.”

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Islanders’ decision to fire Barry Trotz could alter the look of the Detroit Red Wings’ coaching search.

     Why Blackhawks, Barry Trotz Are an Unlikely Match for Head Coaching Position
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Could Barry Trotz be a coaching option for Blackhawks?
originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoSome eyebrow-raising news dropped on Monday morning after the New York Islanders announced they fired head coach Barry Trotz, who is the third-winningest bench boss in NHL history.
The Blackhawks are undoubtedly going to be one of them, but it doesn't feel like there'd be a mutual fit.
The Blackhawks are hoping to have a permanent head coach in place by mid-July at the latest, which is right around the NHL Draft and free agency.
Interim head coach Derek King remains a candidate for the job.

The Islanders fired Barry Trotz on Monday after his squad failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in his four seasons as the team's coach.
Joe Sargent/NHLI via Getty ImagesIn four seasons as the team's coach, Trotz was 152-102-34 and 28-21 in the playoffs.
Trotz's Islanders teams were known for their stingy defense, twice finishing in the top two in goals-against average.
