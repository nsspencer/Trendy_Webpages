    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The St. Louis Blues got a 5-2 win in Game 4 over the Wild, evening the series at 2-2 with the two teams back at Xcel Energy Center Tuesday night.
Fiala’s was a questionable call, as his stick was lifted by the St. Louis player and drew blood.
We have to get back to our game," Wild coach Dean Evason said Monday.
They went 0-for-6 in Game 1, scored twice in Game 2 and were 0-for-4 in Game 5.
But it is if the Wild don’t want to head to St. Louis on Thursday facing elimination.

     Minnesota's Patience Cost Them Game 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Wild knew that after they embarrassed the St. Louis Blues on home ice, St. Louis was going to return in Game 4 with a lot of desperation.
When all was said and done, Minnesota’s patience cost them a commanding lead in the series with a chance to clinch at home in a decisive Game 5.
But the longer the Wild allowed the Blues to play their game, the worse it would get for Minnesota.
St. Louis called upon Binnington for Game 4 after riding Ville Husso the first three games.
“It’s the Minnesota Wild that didn’t get to our game quick enough,” Evason added.

     Wild coach Dean Evason mulls lineup changes ahead of Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After being extremely forthcoming about the Minnesota Wild lineup throughout the regular season, coach Dean Evason has been much more tight lipped with the playoffs underway.
It’s worth noting that Evason did confirm that Alex Goligoski was drawing into the lineup in Game 2, as well as the fact that there wouldn’t be any lineup changes for Game 3 or Game 4.
But Evason appears to be mum again with the Wild set to host the Blues in Game 5 on Tuesday night at Xcel Energy Center.
“We’re excited for tomorrow night,” Evason said of Game 5.
If the Wild win Game 5, that would give them some wiggle room heading into Game 6 in St. Louis.

     Wild Attempt Comeback But Fall Short in Game 4 Loss to Blues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Wild were riding a high after a win in Game 3 but Game 4 did not start with the same kind of jump.
Wild Need Stick ControlApart from Game 1, the Wild have done well with controlling their sticks defensively, as they’ve blocked shots and poke-checked the puck away.
If the Wild can get those two things back under control, it’ll help as they head back home for Game 5.
Wild vs Blues Game 5The Wild will head back to Minnesota to take on the Blues for Game 5.
Kirill Kaprizov, Minnesota Wild (Jess Starr/The Hockey Writers)It’ll be interesting to see if the Wild keep Fleury in the net or if they let Cam Talbot have a turn.

     Summary: Four games into the first round against the Blues, with the teams tied at two games, Fiala has not scored.
Over seven games in the first round last year against Vegas, Fiala had one goal and one assist.

“We know how critical Game 5 is in this tight series.”BLUES at WILD, series tied 2-2 (9:30 p.m. EDT, ESPN)The Blues defense remains an injury-ravaged concern, with Marco Scandella ruled out of Game 5.
KINGS at OILERS, series tied 2-2 (10 p.m. EDT, ESPN2)Connor McDavid and the Oilers could use a power-play spark, a rare scenario for the star-laden squad.
