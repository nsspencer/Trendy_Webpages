     Sam Hunt + Pregnant Wife Hannah Lee Fowler Call Off Their Divorce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Hunt and Hannah Lee Fowler aren't getting divorced, after all.
TMZ reports that Fowler, who filed for divorce in February, has submitted legal documents requesting that the court dismiss their case.
She had originally listed infidelity as the reason for the split, saying that Hunt was "guilty of adultery" and "guilty of inappropriate marital conduct."
The paperwork revealed another bombshell, too: The documents indicated that Fowler is pregnant with the couple's first child, and that her due date is in May.
After her first filing, Fowler withdrew her complaint, briefly leading fans to believe that she'd changed her mind about the divorce.
