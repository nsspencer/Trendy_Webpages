     Summary: The weather is warming up and folks are itching to get out and get away for a while, and the Jersey Shore is a popular spot for doing just that.
But “Ironbound,” is a pretty, darned big great white shark.
There are bigger great white sharks in the world, true, but that’s still a large shark that has been pinging right off the Jersey Shore of late.
He is believed to be about 20-years-old, and he is off the Jersey Shore as he continues to migrate north.
And, the report said, the big fella gets around pretty good, logging about 13,000 miles since he was tagged.

Meet Ironbound, the 1,000-pound great white shark swimming off the coast of New Jersey https://t.co/Gh2GQED1Ft — Miami Herald (@MiamiHerald) May 9, 2022According to Live Science, the giant fish surfaced off the Jersey Shore at around 10:30 p.m. April 28, after being caught and tagged in October 2019.
The nonprofit tags and tracks great white sharks in a bid to “better understand their elusive migrations,” Live Science reported, noting that a SPOT tag is attached to the dorsal fin and relays the shark’s location to a global positioning device satellite.
Hueter estimated that Ironbound is about 20 years old and confirmed to CNN that larger sharks tagged to date by OCEARCH measured as long as 17.5 feet and as heavy as 4,000 pounds.

     Summary: With Memorial Day Weekend fast approaching for beachgoers, the Jersey Shore recently got an advance visit from a gigantic great white shark migrating up the Atlantic coast.
Measuring 12 feet 4 inches and weighing about 998 pounds, the tagged shark is named after the West Ironbound Island in Nova Scotia.
OCEARCH is among the world's leading shark research outfits that uses a data-centric approach to tag and track shark movements during its expeditions.
Last summer, OCEARCH tracked another great white shark off the coast of Cape May.
“They generally just ignore people," Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research, told BBC in 2019.

     Summary: A great white shark weighing approximately 998lbs has been recorded swimming along the New Jersey shore by a marine wildlife non-profit, OCEARCH.
The group, who track shark migration, traced the shark known as “Ironbound” to New Jersey at the end of April, CNN reported on Monday.
“He’s gone back and forth from where we found him in Nova Scotia and the Florida Keys several times,” said Mr Hueter to CNN.
The scientist added that although great white shark numbers had fallen over the past four decades, they were now on the rise again in the Atlantic.
“They in many cases occupy what’s called the apex predator position, in marine food webs.

     Summary: A 1,000-pound (453 kilograms) migrating great white shark surfaced off the coast of New Jersey April 28 while seeking rich fishing grounds farther north.
Researchers nicknamed the shark 'Ironbound' when he was first caught and tagged in 2019, as he was found near West Ironbound Island near Lunenburg, Nova Scotia.
Ocearch tags and tracks great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) in a bid to better understand their elusive migrations.
"White sharks are often portrayed as 'mindless killers' and 'fond of human flesh."
Great white sharks are vulnerable to extinction and have a decreasing population, according to a 2018 assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
