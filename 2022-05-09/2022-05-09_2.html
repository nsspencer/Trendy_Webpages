     Son of late Philippine dictator Marcos takes big lead in unofficial vote count
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MANILA, May 9 (Reuters) - An unofficial vote count in the Philippines presidential election showed a huge early lead for Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the notorious late dictator who ruled the country for 20 years.
Marcos had 15.3 million votes, more than double the number those of his nearest rival, Vice President Leni Robredo, with 46.9% the number of eligible ballots counted, according to an unofficial count by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) .
REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan Read MoreIt closely tracks the outcome of all opinion polls this year, which showed Marcos, a former senator and congressman, with a huge advantage over Robredo, who is allied with the movement that toppled the Marcos dictatorship in 1986.
The vote was also a chance for Marcos to avenge his loss to Robredo in the 2016 vice presidential election, a narrow defeat by just 200,000 votes that he sought unsuccessfully to overturn.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite his family's horrific history of human rights violations and corruption, opinion polls predict Marcos Jr, also known as Bongbong, is likely to win the race.
The Marcoses pillaged the government for up to $10 billion, while thousands of his opponents were detained, tortured, and assassinated.
Around 18,000 positions are up for grabs, ranging from vice president to Senate and House of Representatives representatives to mayors, governors, and councillors.
After the polls shut at 7 p.m., an unofficial vote total might reveal the winner within hours.

Naga City, Philippines – Millions of Filipinos voted on Monday to choose a new president in an election pitting the son of the Philippines’ late strongman against a liberal human rights lawyer.

     Philippines election: polls close in race that could put Marcoses back in power
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before voting began on Monday, opinion polls had Marcos Jr, known in the Philippines as Bongbong, as a clear frontrunner ahead of closest rival Robredo.
The Marcos family has repeatedly denied abuses under martial law and using state funds for their personal use.
Philippine presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr casts his vote at Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in Batac, Ilocos Norte on May 9.
The presidential race bears some similarities to the 2016 election, when Marcos Jr took on Robredo for the vice presidency.
On that occasion Marcos Jr lost, despite leading in the polls for most of the race.
