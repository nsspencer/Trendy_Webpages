     At Start of Mario Batali Trial, Accuser Details Unwanted Groping and Kissing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The woman who has accused the celebrity chef Mario Batali of groping her at a Boston bar inApril 2017 spent several contentious hours testifying on Monday, the opening day of his criminal trial on charges of indecent battery and assault.
The woman, Natalie Tene, 32, who has also filed a lawsuit based on the same encounter with Mr. Batali, was the first and only witness of the day.
Jury selection had been scheduled to begin on Monday, but in the morning Mr. Batali told Judge James Stanton that he would waive his right to a jury trial and instead leave the verdict to the judge.
“The defense in this case is very simple,” said Tony Fuller, Mr. Batali’s lawyer, in his opening statement in Boston Municipal Court.
He is the only one who has faced criminal charges.

     Mario Batali accuser testifies she felt confused and powerless to stop chef
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Massachusetts woman who accused Mario Batali of kissing and groping her while attempting to take a selfie at a Boston restaurant testified Monday that she felt confused and powerless to do anything to stop the celebrity chef.
The trial opened Monday after Batali, perhaps surprisingly, waived his right to a jury trial and opted instead to have a judge decide his fate.
The woman also testified that she felt embarrassed by the 2017 incident – until she saw other women step forward to share similar encounters with Batali.
The 61-year-old was once a Food Network fixture on shows like Molto Mario and Iron Chef America.
Batali has since been bought out of his stake in Eataly, which still has dozens of locations worldwide, including in Boston and New York City.

     Woman at trial says celebrity chef Mario Batali groped her at Boston bar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrity chef Mario Batali is seated at Boston Municipal Court during the first day of his trial on a criminal charge that he forcibly groped and kissed a woman at a restaurant in 2017, in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. May 9, 2022.
BOSTON, May 9 (Reuters) - A teary Boston-area software worker on Monday testified that celebrity chef Mario Batali groped and squeezed her "sensitive feminine areas" five years ago at a Boston bar while posing with her for "selfie" photographs.
Originally slated to face a jury trial, Batali on Monday waived his right to one, leaving his fate to Judge James Stanton.
If convicted, Batali faces up to 2-1/2 years in jail and having to register as a sex offender.
He denied allegations of sexual assault but apologized for "deeply inappropriate" behavior.

     Mario Batali’s Trial for Sexual Misconduct Allegations Begins in Boston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Restaurateur and celebrity chef Mario Batali goes on trial in Boston this week for sexual misconduct allegations dating back to 2017, involving an alleged incident at now-closed Back Bay restaurant Towne Stove and Spirits.
A 2018 report by Eater NY detailed this and other claims by several different women that Batali inappropriately touched them.
The 2018 reporting of the incident at Towne Stove and Spirits was a followup to Eater NY’s initial report in 2017 detailing at least two decades of alleged sexual misconduct by Batali.
The alleged incident at Towne involved Batali suggesting that he and a woman take selfies together after she recognized him at the restaurant.
By early 2019, Batali had divested from all his restaurants.

BOSTON (AP) — Mario Batali’s sexual misconduct trial opened Monday in a Boston court with his accuser recounting how she’d been “shocked, surprised and alarmed” as the celebrity chef aggressively kissed and groped her while taking selfies at a restaurant in 2017.
“Just a lot of touching.”Advertisement:She said she felt embarrassed until she saw other women step forward to share similar encounters with Batali.
I take full responsibility.”Last year, Batali, his business partner and their New York City restaurant company agreed to pay $600,000 to resolve a four-year investigation by the New York attorney general’s office into allegations that Batali, restaurant managers and other workers sexually harassed employees.
