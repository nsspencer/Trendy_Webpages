     Islanders Fire Coach Barry Trotz After Missing N.H.L. Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Islanders were one of the most disappointing teams in the N.H.L.
this season, and Barry Trotz paid the price with unexpected finality.
Lou Lamoriello, the Islanders’ president and general manager, fired Trotz as coach on Monday after the team failed to make the playoffs, saying it was time for a “new voice.”“It would be a tremendous understatement to say that this wasn’t an easy decision to make,” Lamoriello said on a conference call with reporters.
“This is a business decision as far as hockey and winning.”Lamoriello has made 21 coaching changes since he was named general manager of the Devils in 1987 and has not been shy about exchanging one big-name coach for another.
He would not say what his plans were for a new leader behind the bench, but in explaining the surprising move, he made it clear he wanted more out of the current squad.

     Islanders fire Barry Trotz in shock move: ‘This group of players needs a new voice’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “It is my role to make the best decisions for the organization going forward and I believe that this group of players needs a new voice.
This season was an immensely difficult one for both Trotz and the Islanders.
Meanwhile, the Islanders limped to a 37-35-10 record (84 points) to finish fifth in the Metropolitan Division.
“We’re very appreciative of that… These types of decisions are made for going forward, not for the backward.
With this group we have — and they’re on notice right now — that new voice is necessary to have success… My opinion is what makes these decisions.”

     Why Blackhawks, Barry Trotz Are an Unlikely Match for Head Coaching Position
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Could Barry Trotz be a coaching option for Blackhawks?
originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoSome eyebrow-raising news dropped on Monday morning after the New York Islanders announced they fired head coach Barry Trotz, who is the third-winningest bench boss in NHL history.
The Blackhawks are undoubtedly going to be one of them, but it doesn't feel like there'd be a mutual fit.
The Blackhawks are hoping to have a permanent head coach in place by mid-July at the latest, which is right around the NHL Draft and free agency.
Interim head coach Derek King remains a candidate for the job.

     Islanders fire coach Barry Trotz after missing playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barry Trotz was fired as coach of the New York Islanders on Monday, with general manager Lou Lamoriello saying he felt the team needed a new voice.
Trotz lost his job after four seasons with the Islanders and the first without a playoff appearance.
It’s obviously that I thought quite a bit to make this type of a decision.”A series of events outside Trotz’s control contributed to the Islanders missing the playoffs this year.
Lamoriello said the choice to move on from Trotz was not made primarily about what happened this past season.
New York went 152-102-34 in the regular season and 28-21 in the playoffs under Trotz, the organization’s most success in more than two decades.
