    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 0 of 10Credit: WWEWelcome to Bleacher Report's coverage and recap of WWE Raw on May 9.
WrestleMania Backlash featured some great matches, but the only title that changed hands was over on SmackDown, so Raw was mostly unaffected by Sunday's event.
One major change we did see was Rhea Ripley joining Edge's new Judgment Day stable after interfering in his match against AJ Styles.
Monday's show dealt with the fallout from Backlash and began the buildup for Hell in a Cell, and it also featured a U.S. Championship match between Theory and Cody Rhodes.
Let's look at what happened on Monday's show.

     Major WWE Star is Reportedly Finally Returning on WWE Raw Tonight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✖Alexa Bliss is finally returning to WWE television on tonight's Monday Night Raw, according to a report from Fightful Select's Sean Ross Sapp.
She was then pulled from TV again and reportedly voiced her frustration to Vince McMahon about how WWE Creative had nothing new for her.
As a result, she was absent from WrestleMania 38 and when asked why she was missing she repeatedly said she was simply waiting for WWE to contact her.
It looks like that has finally happened.
Sapp's report has Bliss booked to take on Sonya Deville in a match, indicating she'll be returning as a babyface.

     Summary: ORMOND BEACH — A World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Famer is accused in the DUI death of man in a traffic crash earlier this year, authorities said.
Tamara “Sunny” Sytch was arrested Friday night at the Hard Rock Hotel in Daytona Beach, according to a social media post by the Ormond Beach Police Department.
The March 25 crash in Ormond Beach killed Julian Lasseter, 75.
The 49-year-old former wrestler was also charged with multiple counts of causing injury in a DUI crash and driving with a suspended license, records show.
An attorney was not listed for Sytch on jail records.

     Why WWE Fans Will Probably See Less Of Roman Reigns Going Forward
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WWE fans (and those who have Peacock Premium subscriptions ) watched Roman Reigns once again solidify his spot as “Head of the Table” at WrestleMania Backlash.
But going forward, that seat might be vacant in certain scenarios.
In short, fans will probably see less of Roman Reigns going forward, and it’s all tied to a new agreement he’s reportedly worked out with the organization.
Limiting Roman Reigns’ television time also helps keep him as fresh as possible for the rumored WrestleMania 39 match against The Rock .
Roman Reigns appears on Monday Night Raw on USA on Mondays at 8:00 p.m.

     Did WWE Just Change the Rules for the Money in the Bank Briefcase?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✖WWE dropped its first commercial for the 2022 Money in the Bank pay-per-view during Sunday's WrestleMania Backlash event, featuring Cody Rhodes hyping up the event from inside Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.
This marks the first time the annual show will be held inside a stadium but, based on Rhodes' wording in the advertisement, some fans have been left wondering if WWE has changed the rules regarding the Money in the Bank briefcase.
Is WWE making the right call by shaking up the rules for Money in the Bank?
The last three Women's Money in the Bank winners have all cashed in within 24 hours of winning the briefcase, while three of the last five ladder match winners (Baron Corbin, Braun Strowman and Otis) all failed to cash in for one reason or another.
Money in the Bank is scheduled to take place on July 2.

     Summary: The state of Florida has asked to revoke the bond of a former professional wrestler after she was involved in a car accident that killed a 75-year-old in March.
The vehicle that Sytch hit slammed into the car in front of it, according to police.
An attorney for the family of Lasseter also recently filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Sytch, WFTV reported.
In 2019, another WWE star, Jimmy Uso, was arrested in Florida for a DUI.
Newsweek reached out to Ormond Beach Police and Tamara Sytch for additional comment.

     ‘WrestleMania Backlash’ Delivers Some Good Matches but Not Much Else
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you simply enjoy a Sunday night of mindless pro-wrestling action for $4.99 on Peacock, there were some good matches and two great matches.
The only title match saw Ronda Rousey beat Charlotte Flair in an “I Quit” match to win the SmackDown women’s title.
The match was great, the best Rousey match since she returned after having a baby, and the best Charlotte match in months and months.
Suffice to say, this leaves us with no viable contenders for Roman Reigns.
Cody Rhodes beat Seth Rollins in a match that was not quite as good as their WrestleMania match, but very good nonetheless.

     Summary: A few takeaways were abundantly clear from Sunday night’s WrestleMania Backlash pay-per-view, most prominently the line of challengers for Roman Reigns’s spot as WWE and universal champion.
Rhodes and Rollins have tremendous chemistry together, and their match at Backlash made a great deal of sense.
Now, a year after Cesaro got his shot, the same issue exists for WWE: Reigns needs the right opponent.
Based on last night, the next three opponents for Reigns will be Orton, Riddle and McIntyre.
As evidenced by the massive reaction from his RKO on Reigns last night, so is the crowd.

GRADE: A-FINAL THOUGHTSWrestleMania Backlash was certainly a step up from the roller-coaster affair that was WrestleMania 38.
Overall, it was a quality effort from WWE and one can only hope that trend will continue on into the upcoming Hell In A Cell event.
While Ken's niche is firmly rooted in pro wrestling, he's never afraid to branch out and review the latest game or film.
