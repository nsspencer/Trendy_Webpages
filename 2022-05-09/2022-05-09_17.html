     Why Blackhawks, Barry Trotz Are an Unlikely Match for Head Coaching Position
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Could Barry Trotz be a coaching option for Blackhawks?
originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoSome eyebrow-raising news dropped on Monday morning after the New York Islanders announced they fired head coach Barry Trotz, who is the third-winningest bench boss in NHL history.
The Blackhawks are undoubtedly going to be one of them, but it doesn't feel like there'd be a mutual fit.
The Blackhawks are hoping to have a permanent head coach in place by mid-July at the latest, which is right around the NHL Draft and free agency.
Interim head coach Derek King remains a candidate for the job.
