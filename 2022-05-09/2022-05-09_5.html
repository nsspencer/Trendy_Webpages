     Marcos, son of strongman, poised for Philippines election triumph
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Presidential aspirant Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the late dictator, waves after casting his vote in the 2022 national elections at Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in Batac, Ilocos Norte, Philippines, May 9, 2022.
Ferdinand Marcos Jr. clinched a stunning runaway victory in the Philippines' presidential election on Monday in the first win by a majority since a 1986 revolution that toppled his late father's two-decade dictatorship.
Marcos Jr. had 29.9 million votes, double that of Leni Robredo, the vice president, with 93.8% of the eligible ballots counted, according to the unofficial Commission on Elections (COMELEC) tally.
Marcos Jr. has served as a governor, congressman and senator, his sister, Imee, is currently a senator and mother Imelda, the influential power-broker and widow of the late dictator, served four terms in congress.
Marcos Jr.'s son Ferdinand Alexander was poised to win a seat in congress on Monday.

     Summary: ALEX HOLMES, EMERGING ASIA ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS"The victory puts Marcos in a powerful position.
There is little doubt that the Philippines would benefit from upgrading its infrastructure, which is rated as among the worst in Asia."
Philippine presidential candidate Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., son of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, delivers a speech during a campaign rally in Lipa, Batangas province, Philippines, April 20, 2022.
"Courting China would likely involve a trade-off in relations with the Philippines’ traditional ally, the U.S.
"The United States would be better served by engagement rather than criticism of the democratic headwinds buffeting the Philippines."

     Bongbong Marcos’s win in the Philippines sends a warning about authoritarian nostalgia - The Washington Post
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Filipinos seemed ready to embrace their democratic rights and move on from Marcos’s misrule.
Starting out as a foreign correspondent, I often saw popular uprising bringing democracy as the end of the story.
What I learned is that for many people, democracy means little if it doesn’t bring meaningful change to their everyday lives.
In tough economic times, nostalgia and amnesia might be more powerful motivators than concern about democratic institutions and guardrails.
That is what propelled Bongbong Marcos to his overwhelming lead in the crowded presidential contest in the Philippines.

     Summary: Presidential candidate Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the late dictator, waves after casting his vote in the 2022 national elections at Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in Batac, Ilocos Norte, Philippines, May 9, 2022.
President Ferdinand Marcos talks to journalists during his campaign in his northern home province of Ilocos Norte, Laoag, Philippines, in this December 17, 1985 file photo.
Willie Vicoy/REUTERSDespite that history, the dictator's son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who goes by his childhood nickname of "Bongbong," took a decisive early lead as the votes poured in Monday.
In 1986, the Philippines ousted the first Ferdinand Marcos after 21 years of authoritarian rule.
Analysts say Sara Duterte, the daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte and the mayor of Davao City, helped shore up support for Marcos Jr. by joining him on the ticket as his pick for vice president.

     Polls close in pivotal Philippines election that could put Marcoses back in power
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before voting began on Monday, opinion polls had Marcos Jr, known in the Philippines as Bongbong, as a clear frontrunner ahead of closest rival Robredo.
The Marcos family has repeatedly denied abuses under martial law and using state funds for their personal use.
Philippine presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr casts his vote at Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in Batac, Ilocos Norte on May 9.
The presidential race bears some similarities to the 2016 election, when Marcos Jr took on Robredo for the vice presidency.
On that occasion Marcos Jr lost, despite leading in the polls for most of the race.

     Summary: But five years later, the younger Mr. Marcos and his mother were back in the Philippines.
Mr. Marcos has said he would try to shield Mr. Duterte from international court proceedings.
Mr. Marcos’s supporters see in him a glimmer of Mr. Duterte, whose strongman rule remains largely popular in the Philippines.
Many of them backed Mr. Marcos because Sara Duterte, Mr. Duterte’s daughter, ran for vice president on his ticket.
Mr. Marcos will face a range of challenges when he begins presiding over a divided country.
