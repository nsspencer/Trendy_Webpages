     'Candy' on Hulu tells story of real-life murder that shocked the nation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Candy" is great reminder, but the new show also takes her acting career to a new level.
That's no exaggeration, because in real life, Montgomery was charged and stood trial for the brutal murder of Gore.
In fact, Biel and Lynskey give two of the most compelling and interesting performances on TV this year.
"Candy" isn't so much about death and mayhem as it is about characters pushed to their limits.
"Candy" streams on Hulu, owned by Disney, the same parent company as this ABC station.

     Candy movie review &amp; film summary (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deeply dissatisfied by early ‘80s suburban ennui, Candy and Betty don’t realize how much they have in common.
And the easiest target is someone in her friend circle, Allan Gore (Pablo Schreiber), Betty’s husband.
And when she adopts a child with serious anger issues, Allan doesn’t really step to the plate to help out.
And the stellar Lynskey expresses the numbing depression of suburbia in a way that doesn’t feel clichéd.
The way Candy treats her affair like something else on her housewife to-do list is fascinating.

     Candy Premiere Recap: Death, Deception and Casserole — Grade It!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What made Monday’s debut of Hulu’s five-day limited series Candy, starring Jessica Biel, different and more engaging was, well, Jessica Biel.
Christina Gore is the best friend of Candy’s daughter Becky, and the little girl was staying at Candy’s house for a sleepover.
Candy was greeted by Christina’s maladroit mom Betty (played with awkward perfection by Melanie Lynskey), and then… we didn’t see what happened next.
Instead, an hour later, Candy was shown running from Betty’s house, jumping in her car and driving away.
Even without seeing Betty’s dead body, there was no doubt Candy had killed her.

     ‘Candy’ Episode 1 Recap: The Texas Chain Store Massacre
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unusually, Hulu is rolling out all five episodes of the limited series this week, one episode per day.
Shots of Betty’s house, its door shut, exist simply to remind you there’s a body inside.
Biel and Lynskey make for an interesting contrast as Candy and Betty respectively.
When he finally calls Candy to give her the bad news (“She’s been shot.” “…Shot?” Candy replies, confused.)
Candy looks like a bad dream, an earth-toned nightmare, with a title character who seems sweet enough, until your teeth rot away.

     Candy Leaves a Sour Aftertaste
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Did Candy always want to be a housewife, or did her sense of adventure get tamped down at some point?
How did Candy and Pat, and Allan and Betty, meet and fall in love?
In the weeks or months between when Candy was arrested and when she faced trial, what did she go through?
There isn’t much illumination of interiority here on Betty’s part compared with Candy, and historically, that’s all the jury got too.
Instead, Candy ends with the sense that it used Betty too, revictimizing her and flattening her for its purposes.
