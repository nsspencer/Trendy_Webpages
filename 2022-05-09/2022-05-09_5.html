     Marcos, son of strongman, poised for Philippines election triumph
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Presidential aspirant Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the late dictator, waves after casting his vote in the 2022 national elections at Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in Batac, Ilocos Norte, Philippines, May 9, 2022.
Ferdinand Marcos Jr. clinched a stunning runaway victory in the Philippines' presidential election on Monday in the first win by a majority since a 1986 revolution that toppled his late father's two-decade dictatorship.
Marcos Jr. had 29.9 million votes, double that of Leni Robredo, the vice president, with 93.8% of the eligible ballots counted, according to the unofficial Commission on Elections (COMELEC) tally.
Marcos Jr. has served as a governor, congressman and senator, his sister, Imee, is currently a senator and mother Imelda, the influential power-broker and widow of the late dictator, served four terms in congress.
Marcos Jr.'s son Ferdinand Alexander was poised to win a seat in congress on Monday.

     Philippines Election Win Returns Marcos to Power, and Polarisation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though Marcos, 64, campaigned on a platform of unity, political analysts say his presidency is unlikely to foster that, despite the margin of victory.
Philippine stocks fell about 3% on Tuesday, tracking weaker global equities, but with analysts also citing concerns about a Marcos win, particularly its fiscal implications if he follows through on pledges to subsidise food and fuel.
The Marcos family has denied wrongdoing and many of its supporters, bloggers and social media influencers say historical accounts are distorted.
STUDENTS STAGE PROTESTAround 400 people, mostly students, staged a protest outside the election commission on Tuesday against Marcos and citing election irregularities.
As the vote count showed the extent of the Marcos win, Robredo told her supporters to continue their fight for truth until the next election.

     Philippines election results: Bongbong Marcos Jr on cusp of winning landslide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Official results, however, could take weeks to be confirmedKnown as "Bongbong" in the Philippines, Marcos Jr is the son of Ferdinand Marcos Sr, whose 21-year rule was marked by human rights abuses and widespread corruption.
Analysts say Marcos Jr's rise is the culmination of a decades-long attempt to rebrand the Marcos family's name and image, most recently through social media.
Marcos Jr ran on a platform of "unity" and has promised more jobs, lower prices, and more investment in agriculture and infrastructure.
Supporters of the Marcos family say the period was a time of progress and prosperity, characterized by the building of major infrastructure like hospitals, roads and bridges.
The Marcos family has repeatedly denied abuses under martial law and using state funds for their personal use.

     Summary: Presidential candidate Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the late dictator, waves after casting his vote in the 2022 national elections at Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in Batac, Ilocos Norte, Philippines, May 9, 2022.
President Ferdinand Marcos talks to journalists during his campaign in his northern home province of Ilocos Norte, Laoag, Philippines, in this December 17, 1985 file photo.
Willie Vicoy/REUTERSDespite that history, the dictator's son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who goes by his childhood nickname of "Bongbong," took a decisive early lead as the votes poured in Monday.
In 1986, the Philippines ousted the first Ferdinand Marcos after 21 years of authoritarian rule.
Analysts say Sara Duterte, the daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte and the mayor of Davao City, helped shore up support for Marcos Jr. by joining him on the ticket as his pick for vice president.
