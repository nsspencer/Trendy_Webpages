     'Candy' on Hulu tells story of real-life murder that shocked the nation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Candy" is great reminder, but the new show also takes her acting career to a new level.
That's no exaggeration, because in real life, Montgomery was charged and stood trial for the brutal murder of Gore.
In fact, Biel and Lynskey give two of the most compelling and interesting performances on TV this year.
"Candy" isn't so much about death and mayhem as it is about characters pushed to their limits.
"Candy" streams on Hulu, owned by Disney, the same parent company as this ABC station.

     What Hulu's chilling new show 'Candy' is about — and what to know before watching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hulu's new show "Candy" is based on the chilling real-life story of housewife Candy Montgomery.
Biel stars as Montgomery in Hulu's new series, while Melanie Lynskey will play Betty.
Starring Melanie Lynskey as Gore, and Jessica Biel as Gore's friend-turned-murderer Candy Montgomery, the chilling new series will premiere on Monday, May 9.
Here's everything to know about the real-life Montgomery and Gore ahead of the premiere of "Candy."
Pointing to the letters and notes Montgomery left Allan as proof, Gore reportedly grew upset, leading to a struggle with an axe.

     ‘Candy’ Episode 1 Recap: The Texas Chain Store Massacre
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unusually, Hulu is rolling out all five episodes of the limited series this week, one episode per day.
Shots of Betty’s house, its door shut, exist simply to remind you there’s a body inside.
Biel and Lynskey make for an interesting contrast as Candy and Betty respectively.
When he finally calls Candy to give her the bad news (“She’s been shot.” “…Shot?” Candy replies, confused.)
Candy looks like a bad dream, an earth-toned nightmare, with a title character who seems sweet enough, until your teeth rot away.

     Inside the grisly story of an axe killing that inspired new Hulu series ‘Candy’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Candy Montgomery wanted fireworks.
Candy Montgomery ran into Allan Gore – literally – during summer 1978, while both of them were playing on the church volleyball court.
Montgomery reportedly told Allan she was afraid the affair was getting too intense, but the relationship continued.
When Montgomery’s trial began in October 1980, her legal team didn’t seek to deny she had killed Betty Gore.
Candy Montgomery is believed to have also relocated and, according to the newspaper, to have earned a certification as a family counselor.

     Candy Leaves a Sour Aftertaste
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Did Candy always want to be a housewife, or did her sense of adventure get tamped down at some point?
How did Candy and Pat, and Allan and Betty, meet and fall in love?
In the weeks or months between when Candy was arrested and when she faced trial, what did she go through?
There isn’t much illumination of interiority here on Betty’s part compared with Candy, and historically, that’s all the jury got too.
Instead, Candy ends with the sense that it used Betty too, revictimizing her and flattening her for its purposes.
