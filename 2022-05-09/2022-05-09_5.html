     Protests break out as Philippines election returns a Marcos to presidency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though Marcos, 64, campaigned on a platform of unity, political analysts say his presidency is unlikely to foster that, despite the margin of victory.
The Marcos family has denied wrongdoing and many of its supporters, bloggers and social media influencers say historical accounts are distorted.
A big win for Marcos was securing President Rodrigo Duterte's daughter as his vice presidential running mate.
Meanwhile, Amnesty International accused Marcos and his running mate of avoiding discussing human rights violations, including those committed under martial law and during President Duterte's bloody war on drugs.
As the vote count showed the extent of the Marcos win, Robredo told her supporters to continue their fight for truth until the next election.

     Philippines election results: Bongbong Marcos Jr on cusp of winning landslide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Official results, however, could take weeks to be confirmedKnown as "Bongbong" in the Philippines, Marcos Jr is the son of Ferdinand Marcos Sr, whose 21-year rule was marked by human rights abuses and widespread corruption.
Analysts say Marcos Jr's rise is the culmination of a decades-long attempt to rebrand the Marcos family's name and image, most recently through social media.
Marcos Jr ran on a platform of "unity" and has promised more jobs, lower prices, and more investment in agriculture and infrastructure.
Supporters of the Marcos family say the period was a time of progress and prosperity, characterized by the building of major infrastructure like hospitals, roads and bridges.
The Marcos family has repeatedly denied abuses under martial law and using state funds for their personal use.

     Marcos family once ousted by uprising wins Philippines vote in landslide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marcos succeeds the tough-talking President Rodrigo Duterte, best known for his crude insults and a war on drugs that has left thousands dead.
As the numbers steadily trickled in for Marcos, thousands across various precincts were still waiting to cast their votes well past midnight.
AdvertisementAccording to the unofficial count with 97.55 percent of precincts reporting, Marcos won 58 percent of the ballots cast, more than 30 million votes, compared with Duterte’s victory with just 16 million in 2016.
In the Philippines, political dynasties dominate — with the Marcos family being among the most well known.
But with a Marcos win, the family is set to be shielded from accountability.

     Provisional Results Show Landslide Marcos Victory in Philippine Election
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Get the NewsletterWhile these results have not been officially ratified by Comelec, it is clear that the Philippines has elected another Marcos and another Duterte by historic margins.
The margin of victory was accurately reflected in pre-election polls, which showed both Marcos and Duterte-Carpio far out front of the rest of the field.
The broader questions arising from Marcos’ victory concern the overall trajectory of Philippine politics, and how we perceive the global crisis of democracy.
In explanations of the Marcos phenomenon, much attention has focused on the historical revisionism engineered by the Marcos campaign, especially via social media, which has asserted the earlier Marcos reign as an era of stability and order.
But as I’ve noted before, the return of the once-shunned Marcos clan speaks to more profound social and political forces; disinformation alone can neither explain the Marcos victory, nor account for its massive scale.
