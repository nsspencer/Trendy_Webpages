Payne at Michigan State became a star on the court, where he twice earned All-Big Ten honors.
He also developed a bond with Lacey Holsworth, a young Michigan State fan who had terminal cancer.

In the years after leaving the NBA, Payne continued his pursuit of a professional career, playing overseas with several teams.
