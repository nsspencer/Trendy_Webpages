    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Payne signed with Michigan State as a five-star prospect out of Dayton, Ohio, in 2010 over offers from Arizona, Cincinnati and Dayton.
Payne at Michigan State became a star on the court, where he twice earned All-Big Ten honors.
He also developed a bond with Lacey Holsworth, a young Michigan State fan who had terminal cancer.
In the wake of the 2018 ESPN report which detailed inaction and denial related to sexual assault cases at Michigan State -- including an incident involving Appling and Payne -- Michigan State president Lou Anna Simon resigned from her post.
In the years after leaving the NBA, Payne continued his pursuit of a professional career, playing overseas with several teams.
