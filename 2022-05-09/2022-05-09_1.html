     WWE signs deal for new wresting RPG
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A recent WWE financial call has revealed the existence of an upcoming wrestling-based RPG game, which will be officially announced "soon".
"[WWE] recently signed a new deal in the role-playing game space that will be announced soon.
In addition to this statement, McMahon also shared satisfaction for the relaunch of the WWE 2K series, after the company recently skipped a year's release.
McMahon concluded: "Gaming is a priority for WWE to reach our next-gen audience with over 80 percent of WWE's audience self-identifying as gamers."

     An Official WWE Role-Playing Game Is Coming Soon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the absolute mess that was WWE 2K20, I’m not sure that anyone was really expecting great things from 2K22.
Advert 10Regardless, the general consensus when 2K22 released in March this year seemed to be that, yeah, it’s pretty good, actually.
So with that victory under their belts, it’s not at all surprising that WWE have their sights set on their next hit game.
Take a look at the trailer for WWE 2K22 below.
We were extremely pleased with the re-launch of our premium video game console franchise, WWE 2K,” she said.

     RPG based on WWE confirmed to be in development
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HQWe have got tons of different WWE games through the years, with most of them offering fairly straightforward wrestling, but there are a few oddities as well like the car-combat game WWE Crush Hour and the card-based WWE SuperCard.
Now a new surprising title has been confirmed by Stephanie McMahon (former wrestler, daughter to the owner of the company and also chief brand officer), and this one is a yet to be named RPG.
It is currently under development, and judging from McMahon's description of the project during the earnings call last week, it's for smartphones:"We continue to see strength in the performance of our mobile games with 2K and Scopely, SuperCard and Champions, and recently signed a new deal in the role-playing game space that will be announced soon."
We will get back to you with more information when we have it - but in the mean time; how likely is it that you would play a WWE RPG?
Thanks GamingBolt
