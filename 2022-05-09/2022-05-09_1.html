     NBA MVP: Sixers' Joel Embiid finishes behind Nikola Jokic in voting, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MVP is reportedly not in the cards for Joel Embiid this season.
The NBA’s scoring champion finished behind Nikola Jokic in voting for the award for a second straight season, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Monday morning.
In addition to Jokic and Embiid, two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo was the other finalist.
Jokic had another incredible season as the Nuggets’ do-everything big man, leading Denver to 48 wins despite Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. combining to play nine games.
From big man to big man, I’m happy.

     Nuggets star Nikola Jokic makes history, named back-to-back NBA MVP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic was named NBA MVP for the 2021-2022 season on Monday, making him the 13th back-to-back MVP in league history.
Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic has been voted the NBA’s Most Valuable Player for a second consecutive season, sources tell ESPN.
It truly is one of the best individual sports stories (if not the best) in Colorado history.
The Nuggets were defeated by the Golden State Warriors 4-1 in the first-round of the Western Conference playoffs, despite having the best player in the world on their side.
Next up is getting healthy and getting him some help, as The Joker once again reigns supreme as the top player in the NBA.

It’s a weird time to drop the MVP news on a Monday morning, but nonetheless is awesome to now know that Jokic has for sure won MVP.
Jokic joins some elite company as he is just the 13th player in NBA history to win MVP in back-to-back seasons.
Congrats to Jokic, who has now made not only Nuggets history, but NBA history as well!
