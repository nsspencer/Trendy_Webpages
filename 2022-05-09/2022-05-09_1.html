     WATCH: Giannis Antetokounmpo Gets A Ridiculous Technical Foul
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Giannis Antetokounmpo got called for a technical foul in Game 4 between the Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics.
The Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics are facing off in Wisconsin for Game 4 of their second-round playoff series on Monday night, and during the game Giannis Antetokounmpo got called for a silly technical foul.
The two-time NBA MVP threw down a dunk, and then gave a big reaction, but was called for a technical foul.
The series is currently 2-1 in favor of the Bucks, so a win for the Bucks gives them a commanding 3-1 lead.
The Bucks beat the Chicago Bulls in just five games, while the Celtics picked up a sweep against the Brooklyn Nets.

     Celtics' Robert Williams: Ruled out for Game 4 with sore knee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Williams (knee) will not play in Monday's Game 4 against Milwaukee due to soreness in his left knee, Shams Charania of The Athletic reports.
As it turns out, Williams is battling discomfort in his left knee -- the same one on which he underwent surgery in late-March to address a torn meniscus.
After missing roughly three weeks, Williams returned to action midway through the Celtics' first-round series against the Nets and had played in five straight games entering Monday night.
The big man finished Game 3 on Saturday with 10 points, five rebounds, four assists, three blocks and two steals in 23 minutes.
In Williams' absence, Grant Williams will move into the starting lineup alongside Al Horford for Game 4.

     Summary: In what has been a knock-down, drag-out second-round series in the NBA playoffs, the Milwaukee Bucks missed a chance to put the Boston Celtics in a stranglehold.
But the Bucks seemed staggered late in the game, with the Celtics scoring 43 points in the fourth quarter.
Tatum bounced back from a 4-for-19 shooting performance in Game 3 and his big game helped Boston overcome the foul trouble of fellow star Jaylen Brown.
He had 22 points and 16 rebounds in Game 3 but played even better with Robert Williams (knee) sitting out Game 4.
