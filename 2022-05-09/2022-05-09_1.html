     Summary: Here are the top three things we learned last week Bitcoin (BTC)†1: Bitcoin drops through moving averagesYes we know: Moving averages Very simple and doesn’t say much about what the future will bring.
If we look at the 100-week moving average for Bitcoin, we see that the price of BTC in dollars has clearly fallen through the moving average.
Bitcoin is currently doing better against the Euro, although BTC/EUR has passed its support as well.
For example, the weekly candles have all been red since the week of March 28th, and since then the shorter period candles have also shown that Bitcoin is in a downtrend.
Sure enough, the weekly candles are gradually declining.

     Summary: The majority of the cryptocurrency market tumbled on Monday.
Even the stablecoin Terra (UST) fell below the $1 USD it's pegged to.
El Salvador's president Nayib Bukele announced on Twitter that the country purchased 500 Bitcoin while the market was tanking.

Cryptocurrency Prices Today: Bitcoin, EthereumIt’s been a shaky start to the week for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, largely driven by ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.
Ethereum is down 18% over the past week amid a big retreat in Bitcoin and the stock market.
If Bitcoin is falling in price, ethereum is likely falling, too.
