     Philippines Election 2022: Voting underway to decide next president
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite his family's horrific history of human rights violations and corruption, opinion polls predict Marcos Jr, also known as Bongbong, is likely to win the race.
The Marcoses pillaged the government for up to $10 billion, while thousands of his opponents were detained, tortured, and assassinated.
Around 18,000 positions are up for grabs, ranging from vice president to Senate and House of Representatives representatives to mayors, governors, and councillors.
After the polls shut at 7 p.m., an unofficial vote total might reveal the winner within hours.

     Son of Philippines dictator Marcos headed for presidency with huge election lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The massive lead bolsters the chances of a once unthinkable return to rule of the Marcos family, 36 years after its patriarch's overthrow in a "people power" revolution and his family's humiliating retreat into exile.
Despite its fall from grace, the Marcos family returned from exile in the 1990s and has since been a powerful force in politics, retaining its influence with vast wealth and far-reaching connections.
The Marcos family denies siphoning off billions of dollars of state wealth during its time at the helm of what its opponents say was one of Asia's most famous kleptocracies.
Late on Monday as the unofficial votes were counted, a small group of supporters gathered outside the Marcos campaign headquarters, chanting "Marcos, Marcos, Marcos" ecstatically.
Election Commissioner George Erwin Garcia said he was "overwhelmed' by the number of voters flocking to polling centres despite the pandemic threat.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sara Duterte, the daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte, who is running for vice president in support of Mr. Marcos, also led by a wide margin.
She had 18.6 million votes, more than triple her nearest rival, Senator Francis Pangilinan, who had six million votes.
Still, Mr. Marcos’s lead was so strong that it appeared extremely unlikely that Ms. Robredo could prevail.
It remains to be seen if Mr. Marcos will claim victory before that process is complete.
They returned after the death of the older Mr. Marcos in 1989, however.

     Summary: Top contenders in Monday’s vote are Ferdinand Marcos Jr, son of the Philippines’ late dictator, and the current Vice President Leni Robredo.
Polls officially closed at 7pm, but election authorities said those waiting in line would be allowed to vote after the deadline.
The contest has become a two-way race between Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr and the current Vice President Leni Robredo.
On the campaign trail, Marcos Jr referred to “unity” but provided little detail on his policies.
We are scared of Marcos Jr coming back to power, especially paired with Sara Duterte,” she also said.

     Philippines election 2022 looks set to make dictator's son Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. the president
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Presidential candidate Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the late dictator, waves after casting his vote in the 2022 national elections at Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in Batac, Ilocos Norte, Philippines, May 9, 2022.
President Ferdinand Marcos talks to journalists during his campaign in his northern home province of Ilocos Norte, Laoag, Philippines, in this December 17, 1985 file photo.
Willie Vicoy/REUTERSDespite that history, the dictator's son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who goes by his childhood nickname of "Bongbong," took a decisive early lead as the votes poured in Monday.
In 1986, the Philippines ousted the first Ferdinand Marcos after 21 years of authoritarian rule.
Analysts say Sara Duterte, the daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte and the mayor of Davao City, helped shore up support for Marcos Jr. by joining him on the ticket as his pick for vice president.

     Polls close in pivotal Philippines election that could put Marcoses back in power
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before voting began on Monday, opinion polls had Marcos Jr, known in the Philippines as Bongbong, as a clear frontrunner ahead of closest rival Robredo.
The Marcos family has repeatedly denied abuses under martial law and using state funds for their personal use.
Philippine presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr casts his vote at Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in Batac, Ilocos Norte on May 9.
The presidential race bears some similarities to the 2016 election, when Marcos Jr took on Robredo for the vice presidency.
On that occasion Marcos Jr lost, despite leading in the polls for most of the race.
