    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In what has been a knock-down, drag-out second-round series in the NBA playoffs, the Milwaukee Bucks missed a chance to put the Boston Celtics in a stranglehold.
BOX SCORE: Celtics 116, Bucks 108Boston evened the best-of-seven matchup at 2-2.
But the Bucks seemed staggered late in the game, with the Celtics scoring 43 points in the fourth quarter while making 16 of 19 shots.
"He's a hell of a player," Bucks guard Wesley Matthews said.
He had 22 points and 16 rebounds in Game 3 but played even better with Robert Williams (knee) sitting out Game 4.

     Celtics' Robert Williams: Ruled out for Game 4 with sore knee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Williams (knee) will not play in Monday's Game 4 against Milwaukee due to soreness in his left knee, Shams Charania of The Athletic reports.
As it turns out, Williams is battling discomfort in his left knee -- the same one on which he underwent surgery in late-March to address a torn meniscus.
After missing roughly three weeks, Williams returned to action midway through the Celtics' first-round series against the Nets and had played in five straight games entering Monday night.
The big man finished Game 3 on Saturday with 10 points, five rebounds, four assists, three blocks and two steals in 23 minutes.
In Williams' absence, Grant Williams will move into the starting lineup alongside Al Horford for Game 4.

Horford had 16 points and Tatum 12 in the fourth quarter alone to help the Celtics outscore the defending NBA champions 43-28.
After the Celtics lost Game 3 because his potential tying basket came just after the buzzer, Horford made sure this series returned to Boston all tied up.
