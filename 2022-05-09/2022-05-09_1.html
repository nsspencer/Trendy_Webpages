    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cryptocurrency prices tumbled over the weekend and into Monday, with Bitcoin nearing a yearly low as investors continued to dump risky assets amid a tough stock market and challenging macroeconomic backdrop.
The price of Bitcoin has fallen 4% over the past 24 hours to below $33,300, deepening losses from over the weekend after changing hands around $36,000 on Friday.
It puts the largest crypto at its lowest level since January, and a move well below $33,000 would mark a new yearly bottom and the lowest level since July 2021.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bitcoin extended sharp losses Monday, falling below $32,000 after touching a recent high of $40,000 last week.
Earlier in the day, it fell as low as $31,003.22, its weakest point since last July when Bitcoin traded as low as $29,839.80 – the last time bitcoin traded below $30,000.
The crypto market, led by bitcoin, has remained highly correlated with the moves in equities, particularly tech stocks, for about a year.
"Bitcoin has followed the lead of the equity market, extending lower after a weak April," said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies.
"Short-term momentum has deteriorated ... and bitcoin is no longer oversold from a short-term perspective."

     Rough Monday For Bitcoin: 5.2% Drop in 24 Hours
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As of Monday morning, Bitcoin is down to $32,940, a drop that marks a steep fall of more than 50% since its all-time high of $68,990 in November — and Bitcoin isn’t the only digital currency taking a dive.
The dramatic drops follow the Fed’s move last week to hike interest rates by half a point to combat inflation.
The largest interest rate increase in 20 years was met with slipping far and wide, with European and Asian stocks also dropping on Monday.
The pan-European Stoxx 600 slipped by 1.5% by late morning, and Japan's benchmark Nikkei index fell by around 2.5%.
Unfortunately, some say the downward trend isn't over, and is likely to continue for a few days.

     Summary: At a price of just below $32,000, bitcoin is more than 50% below its record high of near $69,000 from late last year and at its lowest point since July 2021.
But he added that "bitcoin is not immune to the global inflation risk spreading across most other asset classes.
That's bad news for bitcoin too, as many crypto backers point to dollar weakness as a bullish sign for digital currencies.
As rates (and the dollar) continue to climb, some crypto skeptics think the selling in bitcoin has only just begun.
The massive pullback in these and other momentum tech stocks is yet another sign of the rapid shift in the market's mood this year.

     Bitcoin Flirts With Lowest Level Since 2021 as Equities Drop
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin is falling toward levels last seen in July 2021, part of a wider retreat in cryptocurrencies amid a global flight from riskier investments.
Equities in Asia and Europe also dropped, with the Nikkei gauge down 2.5% and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index falling 1.2%.
Tightening monetary policy to combat runaway inflation and ebbing liquidity are turning investors away from speculative assets across global markets.
“The downward trend is likely to continue for the next few days,” he said, adding Bitcoin could test the $30,000 level.

     Summary: Bitcoin and ethereum have dropped by 7% over the last 24 hours, with bitcoin approaching $32,000 and ethereum trading near $2,400.
Cryptocurrency Prices Today: Bitcoin, EthereumIt’s been a shaky start to the week for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, largely driven by ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.
Ethereum is down over 15% over the past week amid a big retreat in Bitcoin and the stock market.
If Bitcoin is falling in price, ethereum is likely falling, too.
If it seems like the crypto market has been acting increasingly like the stock market lately, it’s because it has been.
