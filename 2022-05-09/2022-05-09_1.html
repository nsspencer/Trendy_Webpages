    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Nuggets center has won his second straight NBA Most Valuable Player Award, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Monday morning.
Jokic averaged 27.1 points (sixth in NBA), 13.8 rebounds (second in NBA) and 7.9 assists (eighth in NBA) during the regular season.
Jokic and the Nuggets went through the regular season without two of their top players.
Still, Jokic powered the Nuggets to a 48-34 regular season record and the No.
By winning the honor, Jokic became the 15th player in NBA history to earn multiple MVPs and the 13th to earn MVPs in consecutive seasons.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Denver Nuggets’ superstar Nikola Jokic has been voted as the 2021-2022 NBA MVP.
With the award, Jokic becomes just the 13th player in NBA history to win the award in back-to-back seasons.
There were some who believed that Embiid had a realistic shot at dethroning Jokic as MVP this season.
However, arguably the most impressive thing Jokic accomplished during the 2021-2022 NBA season was keeping Denver out of the play-in tournament.
It has been a long time since we have seen a center dominate the league the way Nikola Jokic has.

     Nuggets Center Nikola Jokic to Win Second Straight MVP, per Report

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nuggets center Nikola Jokic has been voted the NBA’s Most Valuable Player for a second consecutive season, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.
Jokic will become just the 13th player in the history of the NBA to win back-to-back MVP awards.
In addition, Jokic is the 14th player in league history to win multiple league MVPs.
In addition to posting some of the best numbers of his career this season, Jokic now also stands alone with his counting stats in three major categories.
Jokic edged out 76ers star center Joel Embiid, who had a phenomenal season in his own right.
