But he added that "bitcoin is not immune to the global inflation risk spreading across most other asset classes.
That's bad news for bitcoin too, as many crypto backers point to dollar weakness as a bullish sign for digital currencies.
As rates (and the dollar) continue to climb, some crypto skeptics think the selling in bitcoin has only just begun.
The massive pullback in these and other momentum tech stocks is yet another sign of the rapid shift in the market's mood this year.

     Bitcoin Price Hits Three-Month Low, What’s Driving This?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last time, the low market momentum following the market crash on December 4th had been the culprit.
Stock Market On The RocksBitcoin’s correlation with the stock market had been on the rise in the past couple of months, eventually hitting a high point in the first quarter of 2022.
In multiple moves, the crypto market has been mirroring the stock market and this same mirroring has triggered the recent downtrend.
It’s easy to see why this is the case given that the largely unregulated crypto market remains more volatile than its stock market counterparts.
Now, while the stock market correlation has had a hand in the recent market crash, it is not the only reason for this.

Cryptocurrency Prices Today: Bitcoin, EthereumIt’s been a shaky start to the week for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, largely driven by ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.
Ethereum is down 18% over the past week amid a big retreat in Bitcoin and the stock market.
If Bitcoin is falling in price, ethereum is likely falling, too.
If it seems like the crypto market has been acting increasingly like the stock market lately, it’s because it has been.
