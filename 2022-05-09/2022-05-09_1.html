     Summary: 2 of 6Credit: WWE.comUnderstanding why WWE did something doesn't mean that makes it okay.
Yes, WWE gave Lashley the original win to pop the crowd and make him look like a big deal.
Yes, Omos won this one in part to make them "even" with each other, and used MVP's help because he's a heel, so that will get you to boo him and not respect him.
Plus, it keeps Lashley looking strong.
It was a predictable outcome that ultimately accomplishes nothing but to stretch this feud out anymore, and one thing WWE doesn't need any more of is feuds that overextend their welcome.

     Summary: CHARLOTTE FLAIR is set to be off WWE television screens for some time as she prepares to marry All Elite Wrestling’s Andrade El Idolo.
The Queen was in action at last night’s WrestleMania Backlash pay-per-view as she defended her SmackDown Women’s Title against Ronda Rousey.
However, it has now emerged that the injury is “very much a storyline angle” in order to write Flair off television storylines.
“I think Manny (Andrade) would be a little angry if I walked down the aisle with my title.
Andrade requested his WWE release in 2021 and quickly joined rival promotion All Elite Wrestling.

     WWE Seemingly Changes Stakes For Money In The Bank
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WWE may have changed the prize for those competing in the upcoming Money In The Bank ladder matches according to an ad starring Cody Rhodes.
During WrestleMania Backlash, an ad was shown for July’s Money In The Bank premium live event which will emanate from the home of 2021’s SummerSlam, Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada.
The ad showed Cody Rhodes discussing the stakes for the eponymous ladder matches and many fans noticed what appears to be a change in stakes for the matches.
Previously, winning the Money In The Bank briefcase meant a WWE Superstar had won a title shot any time, anywhere, for the next calendar year.
The move in recent years to a two-night WrestleMania by WWE however means that a Money In The Bank winner could headline one night, while the Royal Rumble winner still headlines the other.

#6 Omos vs. Bobby Lashley - WWE WrestleMania BacklashWhile it ranks as the lowest out of every match, Bobby Lashley's clash with Omos was an improvement from WrestleMania.
Hopefully, this can help her kick on and enjoy a successful reign atop the SmackDown women's division following WrestleMania Backlash.
The two elite workers exceeded their WrestleMania match with another brilliant effort, which took pieces from it and enhanced the story.
Was WrestleMania Backlash 2022 better than WrestleMania 38?

     Summary: WWE’s first Premium Live Show since WrestleMania took place last night, as WrestleMania Backlash took place from Rhode Island.
The event saw Ronda Rousey capture the SmackDown Women’s Championship and The Bloodline reign supreme in the night’s main event.
You can read the full results from the night here, but GiveMeSport have picked out five headliners coming out of WrestleMania Backlash 2022.
WrestleMania rematches ruleThe clue is in the title, so we shouldn’t expect too much more from WrestleMania Backlash then a ton of reruns from last month’s big event in Dallas.
However, the mere mention of Bray Wyatt’s alter ego, is certainly not something WWE tends to promote from their announce team.
