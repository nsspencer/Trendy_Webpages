     Boston Celtics beat Milwaukee Bucks 116-108 in Game 4, using nearly perfect fourth quarter to even series at 2-2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MILWAUKEE — Al Horford set a new playoff career-high with 30 points, helping the Celtics rally from a 11-point second half deficit and secure a 116-108 victory in Game 4.
The hosts racked up 11 free throw attempts in the period, building a double-digit lead as Boston’s offense sputtered.
Boston were without starting center Rob Williams for the matchup, who was a late scratch due to soreness in his left knee.
Grant Williams got the start in his place but it was Horford who delivered big for Boston in his absence.
Game 5 of the series is at TD Garden on Wednesday night.
