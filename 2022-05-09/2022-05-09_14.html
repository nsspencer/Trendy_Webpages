     Biden signs bill that aims to streamline U.S. military aid to Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. President Joe Biden signs into law S. 3522, the "Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022" at the White House in Washington, May 9, 2022.
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed a bill Monday that will streamline the lengthy process of supplying Ukraine with the military equipment needed for the fight against Russia.
"The cost of the fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression is even more costly," Biden added.
Biden's signature on the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 will make it easier for the U.S. to lend or lease military aid to allies affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Biden already has some power to lend or lease equipment, but the legislation he will sign into law will ease some of the requirements for doing so.

     Biden announces partnership with internet providers to lower costs for low-income households
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden on Monday announced that 20 of the nation's internet providers have committed to lowering costs for low-income households, a step the administration says will increase access to high-speed internet for 48 million households nationwide.
"Over the last few months, my administration has worked closely with internet providers.
The announcement follows provisions in the administration's bipartisan infrastructure law to subsidize wireless internet for low-income families under the Affordable Connectivity Program, which reduces internet service costs for eligible families by up to $30 a month through grant funding.
Biden thanked the participating providers -- which include national names like AT&amp;T, Comcast, Frontier, Spectrum and Verizon, as well as more local providers such as Jackson Energy Authority and Ideatek.
The President said participating providers cover about 80% of the US population.

     Summary: Previously, I had recommended that Congress take overdue action on much needed funding for COVID treatments, vaccines and tests, as part of the Ukraine Supplemental bill.
Without timely COVID funding, more Americans will die needlessly.
In addition, our effort to help lower-income countries get COVID vaccines into arms will stall.
So I call on Congress to pass the Ukrainian Supplemental funding bill immediately, and get it to my desk in the next few days.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In an Oval Office signing ceremony for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act on Monday afternoon, Biden said, "The atrocities that the Russians are engaging in are just beyond the pale."
"I'm signing a bill that provides another important tool in our efforts to support the government of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in their fight to defend their country and their democracy against (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's brutal war -- and it is brutal," Biden said while flanked alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and the bill's sponsors, Indiana Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz, Michigan Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Maryland Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin.
Earlier Monday, Putin delivered an address on Russia's annual Victory Day.
Though many had speculated that the Russian leader may reveal more about his plans in Ukraine, Putin offered few clues about the direction of the conflict.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Putin's claims about NATO "creating threats next to our border" were "patently false and absurd."

     Biden Speeds Up Military Aid to Ukraine, Drawing U.S. Deeper Into War
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Putin wants us to make it a proxy war,” said Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to two presidents now at the Brookings Institution.
“Putin is still telling people outside Europe this is just a repeat of the Cold War, nothing to look at here.
“But saying it out loud helps his public narrative that Russia is fighting the U.S. and NATO in Ukraine, not just the Ukrainians.
No one in Washington really knows the line that should not be crossed with Mr. Putin, and instead the United States has simply been making assumptions.
“They’ve done amazingly well at making stuff happen in a relatively timely fashion,” Mr. Kagan said of the Biden administration.

     Summary: (CNN) President Joe Biden called on Congress to "immediately" pass a nearly $40 billion Ukrainian aid bill, warning for the first time that existing aid will run out in "approximately ten days."
Biden had urged Congress to pass $10 billion in additional pandemic relief funding and the massive new assistance to Ukraine in the same bill.
Biden initially requested $33 billion to help Ukraine as it fights Russia, but Congress has proposed billions more for food aid and military equipment.
"We cannot afford delay in this vital war effort," Biden said in the statement.
"Hence, I am prepared to accept that these two measures move separately, so that the Ukrainian aid bill can get to my desk right away."

     Summary: AdvertisementThe House passed the lend-lease bill last month on a 417-to-10 vote.
The measure, introduced by a bipartisan group of senators, updates a 1941 law the United States used to help its allies during World War II.
“The Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 revives this pivotal program, waiving time-consuming requirements on the president’s authority to send critical defensive resources to Ukraine,” she said.
There, they met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, who thanked the United States for “helping to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity” of his country.
President Biden on April 28 proposed legislation for the United States to provide additional funding to support Ukraine in its defense from Russia’s invasion.

But too many families go without high-speed internet because of the cost or have to cut back on other essentials to make their monthly internet service payments.
Lowering prices—including the cost of high-speed internet service—is President Biden’s top priority.
Today, President Biden and Vice President Harris are announcing that they have secured private sector commitments that will lower high-speed internet costs for millions of American families.
Today’s announcement is just one part of the President’s strategy for lowering the cost of high-speed internet for all Americans.
