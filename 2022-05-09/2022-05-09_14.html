     Warriors' Steve Kerr Praises New Kings' Head Coach Mike Brown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Sunday, the Sacramento Kings made their choice as to who their next head coach was going to be and they decided to hire current Golden State Warriors’ assistant Mike Brown.
After spending the last six seasons as an assistant with the Warriors, including this year, Brown will be joining the Kings organization as their new head coach following the end of Golden State’s postseason run.
Head coach Steve Kerr spoke with the media on Monday afternoon ahead of the Warriors' Game 4 against the Memphis Grizzlies and he praised Brown for the kind of coach and person Brown is.
Brown spent six seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers as their head coach and also spent just over one season with the Los Angeles Lakers as their head coach prior to joining the Golden State Warriors coaching staff in 2016.
Helping the Warriors win two championships, Mike Brown is a highly respected coach around the NBA that has always been known to be a “players-first” type of coach.
