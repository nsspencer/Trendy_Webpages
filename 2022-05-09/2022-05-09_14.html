     Summary: The Sacramento Kings have agreed to a deal with Golden State Warriors assistant Mike Brown to become their next coach, the team announced Monday.
Reports had previously suggested that team owner Vivek Ranadive preferred former Warriors coach Mark Jackson, who was also a finalist, but the front office appears has made Brown their choice.
Brown is best known for his first five-year stint as head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Since then, Brown has served as a top assistant under Warriors coach Steve Kerr.
Brown will attempt to impart his championship experience upon the young Kings and help turn them into winners.
