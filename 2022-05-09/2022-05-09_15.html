     Nikola Jokic’s cards go nuclear after back-to-back MVP win over Joel Embiid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But when everything is said and done, it’s Nikola Jokic who stood tall over Joel Embiid and all the other contenders for the said award.
Nikola Jokic’s second MVP campaignIf this was a few years ago, many would be shocked that a player like Nikola Jokic would have the chance to win back-to-back MVP awards.
Although Jokic’s win last season was justified, the race this year came pretty close with Joel Embiid coming in second.
The state of Nikola Jokic rookie cardsAs compared to LeBron James, Luka Doncic, or Ja Morant’s stocks, Nikola Jokic cards aren’t a top-tier draw in the hobby.
In any case, those who want to diversify their collection would do well with those rare Nikola Jokic cards in the market.
