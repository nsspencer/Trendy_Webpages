     Summary: Colorado Avalanche: 3-0 Nashville Predators: 0-3 Time: 7:30 p.m. MT Watch: ESPN, Altitude, BSSO Listen: Altitude Sports Radio FM 92.5, AM 950 Opponent’s Beat: On the Forecheck (@OnTheForecheck)Game 4 is right around the corner with the Colorado Avalanche’s spot in the second round just around the corner as well.
With a good 60 minutes or more of hockey, the Avs can be the first team to clinch their spot in the quarterfinals of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
They sit in a wonderful position with this chance to clinch and rest up.
This is thanks to the St. Louis Blues and Minnesota Wild having to go at least six games with their series.
But first, they must complete the job against the Nashville Predators tonight.

     Colorado Avalanche complete sweep of Nashville Predators with 5-3 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER – The Colorado Avalanche are on their way to the second round of the NHL playoffs after beating the Nashville Predators 5-3 Monday night in Nashville to complete the opening-round sweep.
André Burakovsky started off the game with a rocket through the goal — literally ripping a hole through the net.
The Avalanche swept the Blues in the first round of last year’s playoffs before falling to the Vegas Golden Knights in six games in the second round.
They have lost in the second round of the playoffs each of the last three seasons, and lost in the first round of the 2017-18 playoffs in coach Jared Bednar’s second season with the team.
Monday’s loss marks the first time in 15 playoff appearances the Predators have been swept out of a series.

     Colorado Avalanche overwhelm Nashville Predators to clinch sweep
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before the Colorado Avalanche entered the postseason, Calgary Flames head coach Darryl Sutter infamously predicted that a first-round series against them would be "a waste of eight days."
It only took seven days for the Avalanche to sweep the Nashville Predators.
Colorado ended their first-round Western Conference series with a 5-3 road win on Monday night, as the top-seeded team in the conference eliminated the final wild-card team.
In the third period, Filip Forsberg gave the Predators a 3-2 lead just 3:58 into the third period.
Just 3:06 later, Makar artfully set up Valeri Nichushkin for a one-timer that gave Colorado the lead.

     Game Preview: Nashville Predators vs Colorado Avalanche (Game 4) 5/9/22
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Nashville Predators had never gone down 0-3 in a playoff series before Saturday night, and tonight they’ll look to avoid getting swept by the Colorado Avalanche.
As I said in the preview for Saturday’s game, we would have been talking very differently about most of the penalties in Game 2 if they hadn’t been able to kill them off, and as Saturday’s game proved, they need to stop taking those.
Darcy Kuemper was not at morning skate today after receiving a stick to the eye area in Saturday’s game.
Assuming he isn’t able to play tonight, or is being held out for precautionary reasons, that still makes very little difference to the Predators’ chances.
How to WatchThe game airs at 8:30 Central on Bally Sports South, ESPN, and Sportsnet, as well as on 102.5 The Game.

     COLORADO AVALANCHE SWEEP: Avs take out Nashville Predators in 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. (KDVR/AP) — Valeri Nichushkin scored the tiebreaking goal with 7:58 left, and the Colorado Avalanche became the first team to advance to the second round Monday night by finishing a sweep of the Nashville Predators 5-3 Monday night.
Andre Burakovsky had a goal and two assists, Cale Makar added a goal and an assist, and Devon Toews added a goal for Colorado.
MacKinnon dominated the series for the Avalanche, raising his career playoff points total to 75.
But the top line remained most active with Cale Makar, Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen leading in points overall through four games.
The Predators went into the series without starting goalie Juuse Saros, who suffered a lower-body injury prior to the playoffs.
