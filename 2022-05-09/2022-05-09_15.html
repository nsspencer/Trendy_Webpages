     Mario Batali Goes on Trial in Sexual Misconduct Case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mario Batali, once considered the best-known celebrity chef in the United States, went on trial Monday in Boston on charges of indecent battery and assault connected to what began as a selfie session in a Boston bar in 2017.
Several prominent chefs and restaurateurs have been accused of sexual harassment and abuse since the #MeToo movement spread into the world of restaurants and hospitality in the fall of 2017, but Mr. Batali is the only one who has faced criminal charges.
If convicted, he could face up to two and a half years in the Suffolk County House of Correction and be required to register as a sex offender.
Jury selection had been scheduled to begin on Monday, but in the morning Mr. Batali told Judge James Stanton that he would waive his right to a jury trial and instead leave the verdict to the judge, The Boston Globe reported.
Testimony was underway by midmorning.

     Mario Batali accuser testifies she felt confused and powerless to stop chef
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Massachusetts woman who accused Mario Batali of kissing and groping her while attempting to take a selfie at a Boston restaurant testified Monday that she felt confused and powerless to do anything to stop the celebrity chef.
The trial opened Monday after Batali, perhaps surprisingly, waived his right to a jury trial and opted instead to have a judge decide his fate.
The woman also testified that she felt embarrassed by the 2017 incident – until she saw other women step forward to share similar encounters with Batali.
The 61-year-old was once a Food Network fixture on shows like Molto Mario and Iron Chef America.
Batali has since been bought out of his stake in Eataly, which still has dozens of locations worldwide, including in Boston and New York City.

     Celebrity chef Mario Batali waives jury trial in sexual misconduct case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — Celebrity chef Mario Batali has waived his right to a jury trial and is opting to have a judge decide his fate in his sexual misconduct trial in Boston.
Batali confirmed the decision to Boston Municipal Court Judge James Stanton as the trial opened Monday morning.
In her opening statement, prosecutor Nina Bonelli described how Batali aggressively and nonconsensually kissed and groped a woman who tried to take a selfie with him at a downtown Boston restaurant in 2017.
Fuller also said the accuser, in an effort to get out of jury duty, recently pleaded guilty to lying during jury selection in another Massachusetts criminal trial because she claimed she was clairvoyant.
The 61-year-old was once a Food Network fixture on shows like “Molto Mario” and “Iron Chef America.” But the ponytail-and-orange Croc-wearing personality’s high-flying career crumbled amid sexual misconduct allegations.

     Woman at trial says celebrity chef Mario Batali groped her at Boston bar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celebrity chef Mario Batali is seated at Boston Municipal Court during the first day of his trial on a criminal charge that he forcibly groped and kissed a woman at a restaurant in 2017, in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. May 9, 2022.
BOSTON, May 9 (Reuters) - A teary Boston-area software worker on Monday testified that celebrity chef Mario Batali groped and squeezed her "sensitive feminine areas" five years ago at a Boston bar while posing with her for "selfie" photographs.
Originally slated to face a jury trial, Batali on Monday waived his right to one, leaving his fate to Judge James Stanton.
If convicted, Batali faces up to 2-1/2 years in jail and having to register as a sex offender.
He denied allegations of sexual assault but apologized for "deeply inappropriate" behavior.

     Mario Batali’s Trial for Sexual Misconduct Allegations Begins in Boston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Restaurateur and celebrity chef Mario Batali goes on trial in Boston this week for sexual misconduct allegations dating back to 2017, involving an alleged incident at now-closed Back Bay restaurant Towne Stove and Spirits.
A 2018 report by Eater NY detailed this and other claims by several different women that Batali inappropriately touched them.
The 2018 reporting of the incident at Towne Stove and Spirits was a followup to Eater NY’s initial report in 2017 detailing at least two decades of alleged sexual misconduct by Batali.
The alleged incident at Towne involved Batali suggesting that he and a woman take selfies together after she recognized him at the restaurant.
By early 2019, Batali had divested from all his restaurants.
