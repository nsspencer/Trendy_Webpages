     Hochman: ‘Unreal’ Blues’ Binnington, who once sparked a season, sparked a series with Game 4 win

     Summary: And those Binnington saves saved the season.
But in Game 4, Binnington made the routine saves, and sure enough, St. Louis scored the first goal.
And the high save Binnington made while Minnesota’s Brandon Duhaime seemingly sat on his lap like he was Santa.
He’s in this series, invested in this series — and could be the difference in this series.
“It was special for sure,” Binnington said.
