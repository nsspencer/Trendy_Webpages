     Summary: Colorado Avalanche: 3-0 Nashville Predators: 0-3 Time: 7:30 p.m. MT Watch: ESPN, Altitude, BSSO Listen: Altitude Sports Radio FM 92.5, AM 950 Opponent’s Beat: On the Forecheck (@OnTheForecheck)Game 4 is right around the corner with the Colorado Avalanche’s spot in the second round just around the corner as well.
With a good 60 minutes or more of hockey, the Avs can be the first team to clinch their spot in the quarterfinals of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
They sit in a wonderful position with this chance to clinch and rest up.
This is thanks to the St. Louis Blues and Minnesota Wild having to go at least six games with their series.
But first, they must complete the job against the Nashville Predators tonight.

     Summary: The Nashville Predators' lines John Hynes penciled in Monday night left much to read between the lines.
The Predators kept answering back after that but it wasn't enough to avoid the first sweep of the Predators in franchise history.
The Avalanche managed two more shots on goal than the Predators' during the latter's first power play.
Cale Makar untied it with 6:27 left in the second with a laser past Connor Ingram.
Trenin tied the score again with 3:11 remaining in the second.

     Colorado Avalanche complete sweep of Nashville Predators with 5-3 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER – The Colorado Avalanche are on their way to the second round of the NHL playoffs after beating the Nashville Predators 5-3 Monday night in Nashville to complete the opening-round sweep.
André Burakovsky started off the game with a rocket through the goal — literally ripping a hole through the net.
The Avalanche swept the Blues in the first round of last year’s playoffs before falling to the Vegas Golden Knights in six games in the second round.
They have lost in the second round of the playoffs each of the last three seasons, and lost in the first round of the 2017-18 playoffs in coach Jared Bednar’s second season with the team.
Monday’s loss marks the first time in 15 playoff appearances the Predators have been swept out of a series.

     Colorado Avalanche overwhelm Nashville Predators to clinch sweep
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before the Colorado Avalanche entered the postseason, Calgary Flames head coach Darryl Sutter infamously predicted that a first-round series against them would be "a waste of eight days."
It only took seven days for the Avalanche to sweep the Nashville Predators.
Colorado ended their first-round Western Conference series with a 5-3 road win on Monday night, as the top-seeded team in the conference eliminated the final wild-card team.
In the third period, Filip Forsberg gave the Predators a 3-2 lead just 3:58 into the third period.
Just 3:06 later, Makar artfully set up Valeri Nichushkin for a one-timer that gave Colorado the lead.

     Nashville Predators 3, Colorado Avalanche 5: That’s a Wrap on the 2021-22 Preds Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If Game 4 wasn’t a microcosm of the entire 2021-22 Nashville Predators’ season, I don’t know what was.
Give credit where it’s due: the Colorado Avalanche were the better team throughout the series.
The Predators, a team that prides themselves on their identity of a “hard team to play against,” never quite lived up to that billing.
If there’s any solace, it’s that Game 4 was the Nashville Predators’ best of the series.
Ultimately, it would be the Preds’ top line that gave Nashville their first lead of the series.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NASHVILLE — A month ago, Calgary coach Darryl Sutter said playing the Western Conference-leading Avalanche in the first round of the playoffs would “be a waste of eight days.”He was almost right.
Colorado roared back at Bridgestone Arena to defeat Nashville 5-3 and sweep the series to advance to the second round for the fourth consecutive year.
“They had a good game tonight and I felt like we didn’t have a great one,” MacKinnon said.
The latter came late in the second period on a bad line change by Colorado.
“We had really good focus throughout the series,” Avs coach Jared Bednar said.
