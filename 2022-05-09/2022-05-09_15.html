     How the Pandemic Shaped the 2022 Tony Nominations Landscape
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The list of 2022 Tony Awards nominees — announced early Monday morning — is a picture of pandemic theater.
For Skeleton Crew, Dominique Morisseau’s third entry in her acclaimed Detroit cycle (it received three nominations including best play), previews were even pushed into early 2022 during its limited-engagement run at the Manhattan Theatre Club.
Omicron-fueled shutterings — which included previous Tony nominees and winners Jagged Little Pill, Ain’t Too Proud and Waitress — are also represented in this year’s nominees pool.
Despite weathering a nearly two-year production pause, Lucas Hnath’s reconstruction of his mother’s kidnapping, Dana H., is among this year’s Tony nominees that represent the season’s pandemic-impacted closures.
Another way the 2022 Tony nominations captured the unique nature of the pandemic season is through its recognition of Black playwrights.

     Tony Nominations 2022: The 7 Biggest Takeaways
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The race for the Tony Awards has officially begun with the announcement of the 2022 nominations on Monday.
In honoring and highlighting the work in a crowded, COVID-disrupted season, nominators surprised, snubbed and gave observers plenty to chatter about.
If any other show looks likely to benefit from the nominations buzz, it’s “Paradise Square.” That one got little critical love and has notably struggled at the box office, but it managed to surprise with 10 nominations including one for best musical.
The 2021-2022 season encompassed an unprecedented number of shows by Black creators, and the nominations list reflects that history-making representation.
The vote for the leading actor in a play category was unusually tight.
