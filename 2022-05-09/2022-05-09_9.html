     Global stock markets fall sharply amid fears over inflation and China slowdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Global markets fell sharply on Monday as fears over rising inflation and a slowdown in China’s export growth fuelled worries about the health of the world economy.
Stocks in Asia-Pacific markets, Europe and the US all dropped into the red as investors fretted that global growth is weakening, at a time when central banks are raising interest rates to rein in surging inflation.
Stocks slid after China’s export growth hit a near two-year low of 3.9% a year in April, down from 14.7% in March.
“Two of the biggest concerns are supply chains and the impact of inflation, including higher interest rates.
“The supply chain disruptions will in turn impact earnings of companies around the world, and thereby their stocks.”European markets fell to a two-month low, down 2.9% at the close of trading.

"You could have argued a few decades ago that the stock market was not the economy, and that was very accurate.

So as the stock market goes through this volatile period, it’s not sending a particularly good sign for the broader growth outlook.
“You could have argued a few decades ago that the stock market was not the economy, and that was very accurate.
The decline in spending slows sales growth and makes share prices less attractive when compared to future earnings.
