     Toronto Maple Leafs Get Crushed in Game Four vs Tampa Bay Lightning

     Summary: May 2, 2022; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Toronto Maple Leafs goalie Jack Campbell (34) makes a save on a shot from Tampa Bay Lightning forward Corey Perry (10) in game one of the first round of the 2022 Stanley Cup Playoffs at Scotiabank Arena.
Mandatory Credit: Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsThe Toronto Maple Leafs had a terrible game Sunday night in Tampa.
The Toronto Maple Leafs once again mounted a somewhat spirited comeback, but that is perhaps the nicest thing anyone will ever say about the game they played tonight, which was very bad.
Toronto Maple Leafs vs Tampa Bay LightningTampa scored immediately, and I think that one thing that really sums this game up completely is the fact that Tampa had 36 scoring chances, and the Leafs had 21.
The Leafs played their worst game last night, but hopefully they still have their best game yet to come.

     Tampa Bay Lightning Game 5 preview: Back to Toronto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the series knotted up at 2-2, the Bolts and Maple Leafs play a pivotal Game 5 Tuesday night at 7:30 p.m.TAMPA, Fla. — This has been a weird series, right?
Besides Game 3 where the Tampa Bay Lightning made a late-game push, the Maple Leafs and Bolts have equally dominated and struggled.
In each contest, the squad who has started with more urgency and pace has won the game.
When Toronto came to Florida for Game 3, this was a 5-game series with three matchups inside AMALIE Arena.
As well as Game 4 went, the Lightning went 1-of-8 on the power play.

     Summary: "Now that we’ve done that twice now in this series, let’s go out and grab the series lead.
....That’s a successful road trip in that sense," said Maple Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe, whose team won Game 3 to regain home-ice advantage.
William Nylander scored twice and Jake Muzzin also had a goal for the Maple Leafs.
The Maple Leafs, meanwhile, were 0 for 2 in man-advantage situations before finally breaking through against Vasilevskiy with the first of Nylander’s two goals at 2:27 of the third.

     Mishkin's Extra Shift: Lightning 7, Maple Leafs 3 - Game 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Minutes later, the Maple Leafs converted on the power play and they never relinquished the lead.
The Lightning had eight power play chances in the game - six of those came in the second period following Colton's goal.
An over-the-glass delay of game penalty on David Kampf, which occurred with the Lightning already on a power play, gave Tampa Bay an extended five-on-three.
Unlike during their five-minute major power play in Game One, the Lightning did well to prevent the Leafs from generating shorthanded chances during those second period power plays.
A post-whistle penalty on the Lightning led to William Nylander's power play goal at 2:27.

     LeBrun: Curtis McElhinney on being part of both Tampa Bay and Toronto playoff team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TORONTO — He has sat in both the Tampa Bay Lightning and Toronto Maple Leafs dressing rooms before playoff games.
McElhinney was also the backup in Tampa Bay for back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in ’20 and ’21.
“It’s been a weird series,’’ McElhinney told The Athletic on Monday from Steamboat Springs, Colorado, where he settled down with his wife and kids after announcing his NHL retirement last October.
But at the time, it was also expected for a young, growing Leafs team.
So, whatever adversity comes now, it’s a Lightning team that won’t be overwhelmed by the moment.
