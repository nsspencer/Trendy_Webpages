     Rivian stock plummets as Ford unloads 8 million shares of EV start-up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Production of electric Rivian R1T pickup trucks on April 11, 2022 at the company's plant in Normal, Ill.Shares of Rivian Automotive opened Monday at a new low following a CNBC report that Ford Motor is selling 8 million shares of the electric vehicle start-up.
CNBC's David Faber reported Saturday that Ford would sell 8 million of its Rivian shares through Goldman Sachs.
The Detroit automaker owned 102 million shares of Rivian.
Rivian said in March it expected to produce 25,000 electric trucks and SUVs this year, as the start-up battles through supply chain constraints and internal production snags.
That would be just half of the vehicle production it forecast to investors last year as part of its IPO roadshow.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 180-day "lockup" period, which prevented insiders and early investors from selling their Rivian shares, expired Monday.
CNBC reported on Saturday that Ford, which owns a 11.4% stake in Rivian, plans to sell 8 million of its 102 million shares.
JPMorgan Chase plans to sell between 13 million to 15 million Rivian shares on behalf of an unidentified seller, according to CNBC.
Amazon, which owns 162 million Rivian shares, is the company's largest stakeholder.
"The report of Ford selling 8 million shares is not what any Rivian investor wants to see," said Dan Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities.

     Rivian plunges 19% as Ford and other investors to sell millions of shares as lock-up period expires

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rivian stock plunged 19% on Monday after CNBC reported that Ford is selling millions of shares.
The expiration of Rivian's lock-up period means insiders can now sell shares in the company following its November IPO.
CNBC reported over the weekend that Ford is selling 8 million of its Rivian shares through a block trade with Goldman Sachs.
Ford owned about 12% of the electric truck manufacturer, or about 102 million shares, prior to the sale.
Meanwhile, JPMorgan is selling a block of 13 million to 15 million Rivian shares for an unknown seller, CNBC reported.

     Why Rivian Stock Sank 39.8% in April but May Could Be Even Worse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a double-digit drop in March, Rivian shares tanked another 39.8% last month, according to data provided by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.
Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter, who cut Rivian's price target to $112 per share from $130 per share.
Barclays analyst Brian Johnson, who cut Rivian's price target to $38 per share from $42 per share.
But here's the thing: Ford owned roughly 102 million shares in Rivian and Amazon nearly 160 million as of last count.
If these companies dump these shares even in tranches, there's little that could stop Rivian shares from sinking further.
