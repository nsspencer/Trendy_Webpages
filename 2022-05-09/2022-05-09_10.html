     Summary: Rivian shares down more than 17% following report of Ford sell-offRivian’s stock price fell more than 17% Monday, a drop prompted by a CNBC report that Ford was selling 8 million shares of the EV automaker.
Ford held a 12% stake, or about 102 million shares, of Rivian.
Over the weekend, David Faber of CNBC reported that Ford would sell 8 million of its Rivian shares through Goldman Sachs.
The news has further accelerated the decline of Rivian’s share price since its IPO last year.
Rivian’s share price reached as high as $179.47 a week later, before coming back down to earth.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rivian electric trucks are seen parked near the Nasdaq MarketSite building in Times Square on November 10, 2021 in New York City.
The downdraft has been particularly brutal for companies that held their market debuts in 2021.
Of 53 tech-related companies tracked by CNBC that went public last year through an IPO or direct listing, all but three are now trading below their offer price (for IPOs) or opening price (for direct listings).
That includes some of the most notable names, such as trading apps Coinbase and Robinhood, electric car maker Rivian, cloud software vendor UiPath and fin-tech companies Marqeta and Toast.
Going public today would require a complete revaluation of their business and leave many late-stage investors and employees with out-of-money stock.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 180-day "lockup" period, which prevented insiders and early investors from selling their Rivian shares, expired Monday.
CNBC reported on Saturday that Ford, which owns a 11.4% stake in Rivian, plans to sell 8 million of its 102 million shares.
JPMorgan Chase plans to sell between 13 million to 15 million Rivian shares on behalf of an unidentified seller, according to CNBC.
Amazon, which owns 162 million Rivian shares, is the company's largest stakeholder.
"The report of Ford selling 8 million shares is not what any Rivian investor wants to see," said Dan Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities.

     Summary: CEO RJ Scaringe warned investors in March that Rivian wouldn't be able to produce as many vehicles in 2022 as it had originally planned, despite a swelling order book.
The electric truck maker may also face questions about whether its largest investors — Amazon and Ford Motor — are losing confidence in the company.
Back in March, Rivian said it had about 83,000 reservations for its R1T pickup and R1S SUV.
Fisker won't begin production until mid-November, but both Lucid and Nikola have already had to reset expectations for this year's production totals.
Wall Street will be looking for an update on production capacity when the company reports this week.

Rivian shares have been sinking after a sharp post-IPO surge“We’ll look at everything,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said of his company’s Rivian stake in a Bloomberg TV interview in January.
Gianarikas said he does not expect the e-commerce giant to reduce its stake, pointing to its order of 100,000 Rivian electric delivery vehicles.
Abdul Latif Jameel, a Saudi Arabia-based group and an investor in Rivian, said it has no plans to sell shares.
Jameel holds almost 114 million Rivian shares, or about 12.8% stake, through Global Oryx -- making it the third biggest holder in the company after T Rowe Price Group Inc. and Amazon.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The electric vehicle startup’s shares have tanked nearly 80% so far this year.
The stock was especially hard-hit after CNBC reported over the weekend that one of Rivian’s two biggest corporate investors, Ford, would sell 8 million of its 102 million shares in the electric vehicle maker.
Sources also told CNBC that JPMorgan plans to sell between 13 million and 15 million shares of Rivian on behalf of an unnamed investor who is looking to offload shares.
The weaker-than-expected forecast spooked investors, with Rivian predicting it would produce just 25,000 electric pickups and SUVs this year.
Contra:Analysts at CFRA maintained a “hold” rating on Rivian stock Monday, despite the recent struggles.
