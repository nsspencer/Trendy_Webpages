     'Kid' Kyrou jumpstarts the Blues' offense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With that in mind, the further adventures of Jordan Kyrou continued Sunday at Enterprise Center in the Blues’ 5-2 Game 4 victory over the Minnesota Wild.
Much to the bewilderment of Berube, Kyrou might have done even more damage on the scoreboard.
Despite all the focus on the Blues’ goaltending situation and injuries on defense, what the Blues do best is score goals.
So far, David Perron (five goals), Kyrou (three) and Ryan O’Reilly (three) have combined for 11 of the 12 goals scored by St. Louis in the series.
Granted, the Blues didn’t cash in on a four-minute power play after yet another high-sticking penalty by Minnesota’s Kevin Fiala in the first period Sunday.
