     New York Islanders fire head coach Barry Trotz after four seasons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The New York Islanders have relieved Barry Trotz of his coaching duties after four seasons with the club, Islanders President and General Manager Lou Lamoriello announced Monday.
The Islanders missed the Stanley Cup playoffs this past season after finishing with a 37-35-10 record.
"It will be a tremendous understatement to say that this was not an easy decision to make," Lamoriello said in a statement to NHL.com"Unfortunately it is my role to make the best decisions for the organization going forward and I believe that this group of players needs a new voice and this in no way is anything negative on Barry Trotz, who as each and every one of you knows is a tremendous human being."
The Islanders qualified for the postseason in Trotz's first three seasons.
The Isles advanced to the Eastern Conference finals in 2020 and 2021 but came up short both times to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning.

     Islanders fire Barry Trotz in shock move: ‘This group of players needs a new voice’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “It is my role to make the best decisions for the organization going forward and I believe that this group of players needs a new voice.
This season was an immensely difficult one for both Trotz and the Islanders.
Meanwhile, the Islanders limped to a 37-35-10 record (84 points) to finish fifth in the Metropolitan Division.
“We’re very appreciative of that… These types of decisions are made for going forward, not for the backward.
With this group we have — and they’re on notice right now — that new voice is necessary to have success… My opinion is what makes these decisions.”

     Islanders fire head coach Barry Trotz as ‘new voice’ needed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a stunning move on Monday the New York Islanders announced that they have fired head coach Barry Trotz after four seasons in charge.
“All my assistants I’ve ever had, I want them all to be head coaches.
I don’t want them not to be head coaches,” Trotz told The Athletic’s Josh Cooper in 2019.
I think Lane has enough people in his corner who he’s worked with, who know him and his success as a head coach and his success as an assistant coach and now as an associate coach.
The Philadelphia Flyers and Detroit Red Wings need head coaches, while the Chicago Blackhawks and Winnipeg Jets had interims for the most of the season.
