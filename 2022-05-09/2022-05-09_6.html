    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rising bond yields continued to pressure stocks as traders maintained their revolt against the Federal Reserve, doubting it can get inflation under control.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield on Monday topped 3.18% , after going above 3% last week for the first time since late 2018.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday tried to defend Moscow's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in a speech on "Victory Day," annual celebrations marking the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany.
Putin urged his forces on to success in Ukraine, saying there's a duty to remember those who prevailed in World War II.

     Summary: The VIX is sometimes referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” because it tends to rise when stocks tumble.
But it did not, and so we continue to wait for an investable bottom.”In One Chart: Stock market selloff in ‘liquidation’ stage.
The Nasdaq dropped 3.4%, leaving it down more than 25% year to date and trading at its lowest intraday level since November 2020.
The VIX, meanwhile, has yet to take out its April high above 36, much less the March high above 37.
BTIGKrinsky said that while this time could be different, every meaningful S&amp;P 500 drawdown of the past 15 years “hasn’t concluded until the VIX curve has gone to -10 or lower.”

     Stock market’s plunge continues on new concerns about global economy.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wall Street’s relentless decline stretched into a sixth week on Monday, fueled by new data from China that added to concerns about a global economy that’s being battered by high inflation, rising interest rates and a malfunctioning supply chain.
The Euro Stoxx 600 fell 2.9 percent, and the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped 3.8 percent.
That could include raising interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point in one go, though he doesn’t think that is necessary right now.
One month of better data probably won’t be enough to calm markets, analysts say, but it could be a start.
Bear markets are similarly uncommon, with the last two having occurred in early 2020 and in the financial crisis before.

     Summary: Stocks extended their longest weekly losing streak in a decade Monday as Fed rate hike worries give way to stagflation bets and a renewed slump for the tech sector.
The region-wide Stoxx 600 was marked 2.8% lower by the close of trading in in Frankfurt trading while the FTSE 100 fell another 2.2% in London.
"US equity sentiment continues to be weak with S&amp;P 500 futures testing this morning the Friday lows around the 4,060 level, which is the key level to watch on the downside," the team added.
