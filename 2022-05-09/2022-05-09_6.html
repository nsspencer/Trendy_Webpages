     Young Thug Arrested on Gang-Related Charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Young Thug was arrested Monday afternoon in Georgia on gang-related charges, according to online jail records.
The “Go Crazy” rapper, legal name Jeffery Lamar Williams, is accused of conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and participation in criminal street gang activity.
According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the RICO act charge comes from an alleged offense committed in January 2013, while the gang activity charge is from an alleged May 2018 incident.
Young Thug’s arrest comes in the wake of a 56-count grand jury indictment reviewed by Rolling Stone filed in Georgia’s Fulton County that names 28 members or associates of YSL — including fellow rapper Gunna, legal name Sergio Giavanni Kitchens, who is also charged with one count of conspiring to violate RICO.
The indictment refers to YSL — of which Young Thug is identified as a founding member — as a “criminal street gang that started in late 2012” that “claims affiliation with the national Bloods gang.” (The YSL enterprise operates under the name “Young Slime Life,” but also shares the same initials as Young Thug’s YSL Records imprint.)
