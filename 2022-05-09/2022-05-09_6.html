     The ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ trailer gets wet and wild
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, last week, about an hour before Doctor Strange 2 screened for press, we were invited to catch a sneak peek of James Cameron’s Avatar: The Way of Water.
Did we watch a half-hour of the film?
Maybe, instead, we saw a special featurette about all the crazy tech that went into making this opus?
We were there for the teaser, a 90-second burst of special effects spectacle, presented in full on Dolby Vision, Dolby Audio, and 3D.
The tech was already pretty advanced in the first film, and it looks even better this time around.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Na'vi are back in the nearly wordless trailer for "Avatar: The Way of Water."
"Way of Water" is the long-awaited sequel to James Cameron's groundbreaking epic.
The teaser explores more of the fictional Pandora than viewers saw in the first film, though its brilliant blues and bioluminescence remain.

     Everybody’s got a gun in Avatar: The Way of Water’s first trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Avatar: The Way of Water’s first trailer is finally here, and, strangely, it’s packing a conspicuous amount of heat.
By transferring his consciousness into the body of his human / Na’vi hybrid avatar, Jake was able to start a new life on Pandora — whose atmosphere is toxic to humans — alongside his chosen Na’vi mate, Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña).
While Jake and Neytiri make their return in The Way of Water’s first trailer, this time around, it isn’t just the two of them.
For any other franchise, a premise that straightforward might not be enough to move people to theaters, but with all the hype Avatar: The Way of Water’s built up ahead of its release, it might do the trick.
Avatar: The Way of Water hits theaters on December 16th.

     The First Avatar: The Way of Water Trailer Splashes Ashore
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you thought that the sequel to James Cameron’s 2009 beyond-blockbuster sci-fi film Avatar was never going to come out, well, that makes sense, it’s been 13 years since the original came to movie screens, and the sequel was originally scheduled to premiere way, way back in 2014.
It’s only taken eight years, but it turns out Avatar: The Way of Water is extremely real and on the way—and the proof is in this very first trailer.
But there are the striking images of Na’v i working together with humans, other Na’v i holding weapons (but are they actual Na’v i or humans in Na’v i avatars?
), and a clear focus on the two species working together—a far cry from the tense human-Na’v i relations chronicled in the original.
Meanwhile, Kate Winslet, Jemaine Clement, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, Vin Diesel, Oona Champlin, and many more join the cast.
