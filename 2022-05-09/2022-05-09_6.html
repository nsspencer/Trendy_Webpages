     Atlanta rapper Young Thug arrested on RICO, gang charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rapper Young Thug was one of 28 people indicted Monday in Georgia on conspiracy to violate the state’s RICO act and street gang charges, according to jail recordsATLANTA -- Rapper Young Thug was one of 28 people indicted Monday in Georgia on conspiracy to violate the state's RICO act and street gang charges, according to jail records.
The Atlanta rapper, whose name is Jeffrey Lamar Williams, was arrested at his home in Buckhead, an Atlanta neighborhood just north of downtown.
Young Thug is allegedly one of three founders of the Young Slime Life, “a criminal street gang that started in late 2012” in Atlanta, the indictment says.
It was not immediately known if Gunna, who is accused of conspiracy to violate the state's RICO act, has been arrested.
In April 2021 Young Thug and Gunna posted bail for 30 low-level inmates who were unable to afford the costs themselves.

     Young Thug, Atlanta Rap Star, Is Arrested on Gang-Related Charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Contacted late Monday night, Drew Findling, a lawyer who has represented Mr. Williams in the past, declined to comment.
In April 2021, Ms. Willis charged a dozen people who were said to be members of gangs in that rival cluster, including Rayshawn Bennett, another famous rap artist whose stage name is YFN Lucci.
Mr. Bennett was indicted on, among other things, a felony murder charge in connection with a drive-by shooting.
Monday’s indictment charges three people accused of being YSL members with attempted murder in an attack on Mr. Bennett, who was stabbed in jail in February.
“If they committed acts of violence, and if we have enough evidence to substantiate that, you’re going to see indictments,” Ms. Willis said.

     Young Thug Arrested in Georgia on Gang-Related Charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Young Thug was arrested Monday afternoon in Georgia on gang-related charges, according to online jail records.
The 88-page indictment reveals Young Thug is both directly and indirectly associated with a slew of criminal activity, ranging from armed robbery and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon to murder.
In February of this year, two YSL associates asked Young Thug for “permission” to “make a second attempt to murder” Atlanta rapper YFN Lucci while he was incarcerated at Fulton County Jail awaiting trial for murder.
In July 2015, Young Thug was arrested during a raid on his home and charged with weapons and drug violations after making “terroristic threats” against a mall security guard.
Like Monday’s indictment, that filing also centered on Young Thug’s high-level involvement with the YSL organization.
