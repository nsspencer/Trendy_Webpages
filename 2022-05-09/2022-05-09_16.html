     Sam Hunt + Pregnant Wife Hannah Lee Fowler Call Off Their Divorce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Hunt and Hannah Lee Fowler aren't getting divorced, after all.
TMZ reports that Fowler, who filed for divorce in February, has submitted legal documents requesting that the court dismiss their case.
She had originally listed infidelity as the reason for the split, saying that Hunt was "guilty of adultery" and "guilty of inappropriate marital conduct."
The paperwork revealed another bombshell, too: The documents indicated that Fowler is pregnant with the couple's first child, and that her due date is in May.
After her first filing, Fowler withdrew her complaint, briefly leading fans to believe that she'd changed her mind about the divorce.

Just two months after she first filed for divorce, Hannah Lee Fowler asked the court in April to dismiss the case, and a judge signed off on her request, according to documents obtained by PEOPLE.
The reversal comes after Fowler, 33, first filed for divorce in February, then withdrew her initial complaints hours later and re-filed the same day in a different county.
In her divorce filing, Fowler said Hunt was guilty of "inappropriate marital conduct" and adultery, and indicated that she believes "all hopes of reconciliation are exhausted."
The "Body Like a Back Road" singer said in March that he and Fowler were expecting a baby girl.
