     Summary: “It is my role to make the best decisions for the organization going forward and I believe that this group of players needs a new voice.
This season was an immensely difficult one for both Trotz and the Islanders.
Meanwhile, the Islanders limped to a 37-35-10 record (84 points) to finish fifth in the Metropolitan Division.
“We’re very appreciative of that… These types of decisions are made for going forward, not for the backward.
With this group we have — and they’re on notice right now — that new voice is necessary to have success… My opinion is what makes these decisions.”

     New York Islanders fire coach Barry Trotz after missing playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Islanders fired head coach Barry Trotz on Monday, with president and general manager Lou Lamoriello saying the team needs "a new voice."
The Islanders fired Barry Trotz on Monday after his squad failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in his four seasons as the team's coach.
Joe Sargent/NHLI via Getty ImagesIn four seasons as the team's coach, Trotz was 152-102-34 and 28-21 in the playoffs.
Trotz's Islanders teams were known for their stingy defense, twice finishing in the top two in goals-against average.
Offensively, Trotz's teams didn't finish higher than 21st in goals per game average during his time with the Islanders.

     Summary: Barry Trotz was fired as coach of the New York Islanders on Monday, with general manager Lou Lamoriello saying he felt the team needed a new voice.
Trotz lost his job after four seasons with the Islanders and the first without a playoff appearance.
It’s obviously that I thought quite a bit to make this type of a decision.”A series of events outside Trotz’s control contributed to the Islanders missing the playoffs this year.
Lamoriello said the choice to move on from Trotz was not made primarily about what happened this past season.
New York went 152-102-34 in the regular season and 28-21 in the playoffs under Trotz, the organization’s most success in more than two decades.
