     Summary: Erling Haaland Contract Worth £100 Million To Tie Him To Man City Until 2027With Erling Haaland poised to be imminently confirmed as a Manchester City player, transfer insider Fabrizio Romano has revealed some contract details.
According to Romano, Norway forward Haaland has agreed a five-year deal at City on the same pay as current top-earner Kevin De Bruyne.
Therefore, Haaland should earn a little more than £100m over the five years of his City contract until 2027.
City won the race to sign Haaland despite interest from Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid.
"The project of Manchester City was really important for Haaland."

     Erling Haaland Appears Set to Join Manchester City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Those figures are not an issue for City, which is bankrolled by the billionaire brother of the ruler of the United Arab Emirates and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to assemble one of the world’s most-talented squads.
Closing the deal for Haaland this week will allow him to say farewell to Dortmund’s fans in the club’s final game of the season on Saturday, at home to Hertha Berlin.
City currently leads Liverpool in the Premier League title race by 3 points with three games remaining, but it entered the chase for Haaland with an eye on finally winning the Champions League.
A prolific scorer who possesses a fearsome mix of size, speed and skill, Haaland, who turns 22 in July, has been ticketed for global stardom since his teens.
The son of the former Premier League midfielder Alfie Haaland, Erling Haaland made his debut for his boyhood club, Norway’s Bryne FK, as a 15-year-old, and joined Molde a year later, signed by the former Manchester United star Ole Gunner Solskjaer, who was Molde’s manager at the time.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City, already with what is viewed as the most talented squad in the world, have added Erling Haaland, arguably the top young player in the game, according to CBS Soccer Insider Fabrizio Romano.
Haaland is expected to give his farewell to Borussia Dortmund on Saturday after the last game of the season at home against Hertha Berlin.
Haaland underwent the medicals on Monday in Brussels, and in the next hours Manchester City will activate the release clause as it was written in the deal with Borussia Dortmund.
The release clause at the end will be closer to $63.3 million (60 million euros) rather than $79.2 million (75 million euros) as it was reported before.
Additionally, Haaland's camp agreed with Manchester City on a salary that won't go beyond the one of Kevin De Bruyne, now worth approximately $462,700 per week (375,000 pounds).

     Summary: Erling Haaland has broken numerous goalscoring records since moving to Dortmund.
What he did know for sure, however, was if Haaland did leave, Dortmund will continue competing as it always has done.
"It's a decision for Erling," Watzke said.
"But we [Dortmund] have played football for 113 years, and for 111 years, we played without Erling Haaland.
"Then next came Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and then Erling Haaland and you can be sure if Erling takes a decision to leave us, we will find the next [player] 100% percent."
