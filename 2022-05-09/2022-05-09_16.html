With a good 60 minutes or more of hockey, the Avs can be the first team to clinch their spot in the quarterfinals of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
They sit in a wonderful position with this chance to clinch and rest up.
This is thanks to the St. Louis Blues and Minnesota Wild having to go at least six games with their series.
But first, they must complete the job against the Nashville Predators tonight.

     Colorado Avalanche complete sweep of Nashville Predators with 5-3 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER – The Colorado Avalanche are on their way to the second round of the NHL playoffs after beating the Nashville Predators 5-3 Monday night in Nashville to complete the opening-round sweep.
André Burakovsky started off the game with a rocket through the goal — literally ripping a hole through the net.
The Avalanche swept the Blues in the first round of last year’s playoffs before falling to the Vegas Golden Knights in six games in the second round.
They have lost in the second round of the playoffs each of the last three seasons, and lost in the first round of the 2017-18 playoffs in coach Jared Bednar’s second season with the team.
Monday’s loss marks the first time in 15 playoff appearances the Predators have been swept out of a series.

     Colorado Avalanche overwhelm Nashville Predators to clinch sweep
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before the Colorado Avalanche entered the postseason, Calgary Flames head coach Darryl Sutter infamously predicted that a first-round series against them would be "a waste of eight days."
It only took seven days for the Avalanche to sweep the Nashville Predators.
Colorado ended their first-round Western Conference series with a 5-3 road win on Monday night, as the top-seeded team in the conference eliminated the final wild-card team.
In the third period, Filip Forsberg gave the Predators a 3-2 lead just 3:58 into the third period.
Just 3:06 later, Makar artfully set up Valeri Nichushkin for a one-timer that gave Colorado the lead.

     Nashville Predators 3, Colorado Avalanche 5: That’s a Wrap on the 2021-22 Preds Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If Game 4 wasn’t a microcosm of the entire 2021-22 Nashville Predators’ season, I don’t know what was.
Give credit where it’s due: the Colorado Avalanche were the better team throughout the series.
The Predators, a team that prides themselves on their identity of a “hard team to play against,” never quite lived up to that billing.
If there’s any solace, it’s that Game 4 was the Nashville Predators’ best of the series.
Ultimately, it would be the Preds’ top line that gave Nashville their first lead of the series.

     Summary: Goalie Pavel Francouz will start for the Colorado Avalanche when they try to sweep the Nashville Predators with a win in Game 4 of the Western Conference First Round on Monday.
The toe of Predators forward Ryan Johansen's stick blade poked through the eyehole of Kuemper's mask.
Avalanche coach Jared Bednar had left open the possibility Kuemper might play in Game 4 if the swelling went down, but Kuemper did not take part in the morning skate.
