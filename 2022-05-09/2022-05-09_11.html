     Wild sign Pavel Novak to rookie contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before a summer full of inevitable transactions, we are getting a sweet little taste — some transaction hors d’oeuvres — in the middle of the playoffs.
Announced by the team on Monday afternoon, the Minnesota Wild have signed prospect Pavel Novak to a three-year, entry-level contract that will start next season.
NEWS: We've signed Pavel Novak to a three-year, entry level contract.#mnwild — Minnesota Wild (@mnwild) May 9, 2022The 20-year-old Czech winger was drafted in the fifth round of the 2020 NHL Draft at 146th overall, and is yet another hopeful offensive tool that the Wild can add to their bulging cupboard of young players.
While playing for the WHL’s Kelowna Rockets this past season, Novak scored 29 goals and 72 points in 62 games.
Minnesota selected just five players in the 2020 draft, after moving around some picks and trying to get higher up the board, and it seems like they might get a decent haul now.
