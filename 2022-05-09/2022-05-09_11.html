     Sam Hunt + Pregnant Wife Hannah Lee Fowler Call Off Their Divorce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Hunt and Hannah Lee Fowler aren't getting divorced, after all.
TMZ reports that Fowler, who filed for divorce in February, has submitted legal documents requesting that the court dismiss their case.
She had originally listed infidelity as the reason for the split, saying that Hunt was "guilty of adultery" and "guilty of inappropriate marital conduct."
The paperwork revealed another bombshell, too: The documents indicated that Fowler is pregnant with the couple's first child, and that her due date is in May.
After her first filing, Fowler withdrew her complaint, briefly leading fans to believe that she'd changed her mind about the divorce.

     Summary: The wife of country singer Sam Hunt is changing her tune.
A judge canceled the couple’s divorce proceedings in April at the request of wife Hannah Lee Fowler, TMZ reported over the weekend.
Fowler, who is pregnant with her and Hunt’s first child, had filed for divorce in February, accusing the 37-year-old singer of “inappropriate marital conduct” at the time.
Neither Hunt nor Fowler had announced the pregnancy before she submitted the divorce filing.
They haven’t commented publicly on the end of the divorce case, but were reportedly seen together recently in Tennessee.
