    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cryptocurrency prices tumbled over the weekend and into Monday, with Bitcoin nearing a yearly low as investors continued to dump risky assets amid a tough stock market and challenging macroeconomic backdrop.
The price of Bitcoin has fallen 4% over the past 24 hours to below $33,300, deepening losses from over the weekend after changing hands around $36,000 on Friday.
It puts the largest crypto at its lowest level since January, and a move well below $33,000 would mark a new yearly bottom and the lowest level since July 2021.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bitcoin market has been in a constant decline since hitting its all-time high of $69,000 late last year.
The price has fallen in four straight days with about a 3% decline in the last 24 hours trading at the current price of $33,697 as of press time.
Its current price is the lowest since late January.
For some months now, the Bitcoin price had moved to and fro between $46000 and $35,000.
The struggle of the Bitcoin market as investors are unaware of how long the bearish run would last has not affected its adoption rate in any way.

     Summary: According to data on CoinGecko, Bitcoin price has fallen by 43.8 percent in one year.
In the last 30 days, BTC price is down by 21.9 percent.
There are several topical reasons behind the falling price of Bitcoin and other cryptos.
This means that the bitcoin price on Coinbase is higher than on Binance.
However, especially in India, regulatory uncertainty and introduction of a punishing crypto tax regime are quickly turning the new-age virtual digital assets less attractive.
