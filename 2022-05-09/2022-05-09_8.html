     St. Louis Blues: 3 Reasons To Stick With Jordan Binnington For Now
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The St. Louis Blues find themselves in an interesting position.
St. Louis did that by turning to Jordan Binnington in Game 4 against the Minnesota Wild.
Goaltending is always a hot-button topic in every NHL city, especially St. Louis.
If not for an injury to Husso, Binnington would have never gotten his look in 2019.
The series got evened up with Binnington in net and the team playing well in front of him.

     Turnovers and Unlucky Bounces Proved Too Costly In Game 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Wild’s 5-2 loss against the St. Louis Blues in Game 4 was not the byproduct of getting outplayed but rather sloppy defensive turnovers and a few unlucky bounces.
It shouldn’t be a surprise that the Wild dominated at 5-on-5 despite losing the game.
The Wild were slow at the start of the game and had a prevalent lack of energy.
He ultimately didn’t have his best game, allowing 0.67 goals above expected with four goals on 33 shots.
The Wild were the better team at even strength in Game 4, but costly mistakes and unlucky bounces spoiled Minnesota’s late-game push.

     Summary: It has been a similar story for Fiala this postseason as he’s been bottled up by the St. Louis Blues through the first four games of the opening-round series.
“They play pretty tight,” Fiala said after the Wild suffered a 5-2 loss in Game 4 on Sunday in St. Louis.
That’s something Fiala prided himself on after struggling with such things early in his career.
“Well, frustrated or not, it’s a new game,” Fiala said.
New chances.”There were some positives from the final 20 minutes of Game 4 that give Fiala some confidence heading into Game 5.

     Blues Weekly: Perron, Injuries, Binnington &amp; More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The playoff series between the St. Louis Blues and Minnesota Wild is now tied 2-2 after the Blues bounced back in a Game 4 victory on home ice.
Ryan O’Reilly, David Perron (The Hockey Writers)This series being tied was the expectation, but the journey to get there has been quite surprising, especially from the Blues’ perspective.
Perron Nets Five Goals in Four GamesNot only has David Perron been brilliant in this series, but it’s rubbing off on Ryan O’Reilly too, who has also been tremendous.

     Hochman: ‘Unreal’ Blues’ Binnington, who once sparked a season, sparked a series with Game 4 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And those Binnington saves saved the season.
But in Game 4, Binnington made the routine saves, and sure enough, St. Louis scored the first goal.
And the high save Binnington made while Minnesota’s Brandon Duhaime seemingly sat on his lap like he was Santa.
He’s in this series, invested in this series — and could be the difference in this series.
“It was special for sure,” Binnington said.
