     The Tragic True Story Behind Hulu's Candy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch : Jessica Biel Goes Dark &amp; Grim in Hulu's CandyWarning: Spoilers ahead!
When Candy Montgomery and Allan Gore started an extramarital affair, they never could've predicted the events to come—or that they would be re-created by Jessica Biel and Pablo Schreiber in the Hulu limited series Candy.
As Texas Monthly's sources tell it, Candy (Biel) was content raising her two children and socializing with other churchgoers in her quiet Southern town.
Their conversations were innocent at first, but Candy found herself drawn to Allan, yearning for someone to fulfill the sexual desires her husband, Pat (Timothy Simmons), couldn't.
But Texas Monthly's sources said that Allan also felt his marriage lacked the passion he craved.

     Candy Montgomery Was an Average Housewife. Until Her Friend Turned Up Dead, Anyway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Candy, an '80s housewife who killed her friend and lover's wife with a three-foot ax, is based on true events.
When Betty and Allen's daughter was born in 1979, he ended the affair, leaving Candy distraught.
After attempting to deny the affair, Candy eventually confessed.
Candy cleaned herself up and went about her day as normal, leaving Betty dead on the floor and her newborn upstairs sleeping.
Not much can be said for sure about where Candy ended up after.

     Summary: Hulu's ‘Candy’ Encapsulates What We Love About True Crime but in a Structurally Disorganized WayBy Sara Clements | TV | May 9, 2022 |By Sara Clements | TV | May 9, 2022 |No true-crime podcast or show these days seems to struggle to find an audience.
True crime is fascinating, especially so when someone who seems so normal commits the most brutal and grisly crime.
The things that make Candy and Betty so different in personality could only be picked out thanks to how the actresses portray them.
The series is about how someone who seemed so normal could actually be insane, encapsulating our fascination with true crime.
That’s the enjoyment of true crime after all.

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘Candy’ On Hulu, Where Jessica Biel And Melanie Lynskey Star In A Dramatization Of The Candy Montgomery Case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first, Candy, starring Jessica Biel and Melanie Lynskey, will be rolled out by Hulu over five straight days, like an old-fashioned network miniseries.
The Gist: Candy Montgomery (Jessica Biel) seems to have everything together; she and her husband Pat (Timothy Simons) have a solid marriage, two kids, and a nice house in suburban Texas.
The story of Betty Gore’s killing at the hands of Candy Montgomery has been told in a number of true-crime docuseries, like Snapped.
Another series about this case, Love And Death, will debut on HBO Max later this year, with Elizabeth Olsen playing Candy Montgomery.
But, as we said, the idea behind this telling of the Montgomery case is how Candy came out of that seemingly mundane visit to Betty’s house and what led to it.

     Inside the grisly story of an axe killing that inspired new Hulu series ‘Candy’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Candy Montgomery wanted fireworks.
Candy Montgomery ran into Allan Gore – literally – during summer 1978, while both of them were playing on the church volleyball court.
Montgomery reportedly told Allan she was afraid the affair was getting too intense, but the relationship continued.
When Montgomery’s trial began in October 1980, her legal team didn’t seek to deny she had killed Betty Gore.
Candy Montgomery is believed to have also relocated and, according to the newspaper, to have earned a certification as a family counselor.
