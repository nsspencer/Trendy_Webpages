     Adreian Payne, first-round pick in 2014 NBA draft, dies at 31 in Florida shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adreian Payne, the former NBA first-round draft pick whose friendship with a young cancer patient during his senior season at Michigan State University made national headlines in 2014, was fatally shot Monday morning in Central Florida, authorities said.
The suspect, Lawrence Dority, 29, stayed at the scene and was interviewed by homicide detectives, the sheriff's office said.
At Michigan State, Payne gained national attention not only for his play on the court but also because of a bond he formed with a young cancer patient off it.
The Orlando Magic waived Payne in January 2018 after ESPN detailed sexual assault allegations against former players at Michigan State.
“So sad to hear that former Michigan State star Adreian Payne passed away at the age of 31.

     Summary: Payne signed with Michigan State as a five-star prospect out of Dayton, Ohio, in 2010 over offers from Arizona, Cincinnati and Dayton.
Payne at Michigan State became a star on the court, where he twice earned All-Big Ten honors.
He also developed a bond with Lacey Holsworth, a young Michigan State fan who had terminal cancer.
In the wake of the 2018 ESPN report which detailed inaction and denial related to sexual assault cases at Michigan State -- including an incident involving Appling and Payne -- Michigan State president Lou Anna Simon resigned from her post.
In the years after leaving the NBA, Payne continued his pursuit of a professional career, playing overseas with several teams.
