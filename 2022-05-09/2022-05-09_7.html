     Jessica Biel Shines in New Hulu Series, ‘Candy’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There's a sharp contrast between their lifestyles and personalities, but it's clear that both ladies have a huge need that their marriages can't satisfy.
In Betty's case, it's quality time with her husband, Allan (Pablo Schreiber)—except he's always leaving her to travel for work.
And as for Candy, what she really wants is to add some spice to her love life, but this seems virtually impossible with her geeky and clueless husband.
It's that buildup of suspense that's bound to reel any viewer in and keep them guessing—without the terrifying jump scares.
Whether you're fascinated by true-crime stories or just looking for a binge-worthy, thought-provoking drama, do yourself a favor and add Candy to your list.

     Inside the grisly story of an axe killing that inspired new Hulu series ‘Candy’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Candy Montgomery wanted fireworks.
Candy Montgomery ran into Allan Gore – literally – during summer 1978, while both of them were playing on the church volleyball court.
Montgomery reportedly told Allan she was afraid the affair was getting too intense, but the relationship continued.
When Montgomery’s trial began in October 1980, her legal team didn’t seek to deny she had killed Betty Gore.
Candy Montgomery is believed to have also relocated and, according to the newspaper, to have earned a certification as a family counselor.
