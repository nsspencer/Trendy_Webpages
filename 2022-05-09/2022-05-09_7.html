    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rising bond yields continued to pressure stocks as traders maintained their revolt against the Federal Reserve, doubting it can get inflation under control.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield on Monday topped 3.18% , after going above 3% last week for the first time since late 2018.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday tried to defend Moscow's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in a speech on "Victory Day," annual celebrations marking the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany.
Putin urged his forces on to success in Ukraine, saying there's a duty to remember those who prevailed in World War II.

     Summary: Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe stock market may not literally be the economy, but the distinction between the two is getting increasingly harder to draw.
So as the stock market goes through this volatile period, it's not sending a particularly good sign for the broader growth outlook.
"You could have argued a few decades ago that the stock market was not the economy, and that was very accurate.
No one would argue that the stock market is all of the economy, but it's also hard to dispute the notion that it's become a larger part of everyday life.
"If stock prices are down, it's much more difficult to raise equity.

     Summary: The VIX is sometimes referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” because it tends to rise when stocks tumble.
But it did not, and so we continue to wait for an investable bottom.”In One Chart: Stock market selloff in ‘liquidation’ stage.
The Nasdaq dropped 3.4%, leaving it down more than 25% year to date and trading at its lowest intraday level since November 2020.
The VIX, meanwhile, has yet to take out its April high above 36, much less the March high above 37.
BTIGKrinsky said that while this time could be different, every meaningful S&amp;P 500 drawdown of the past 15 years “hasn’t concluded until the VIX curve has gone to -10 or lower.”

     Why Is the Stock Market Down Today? Dow Slides as Selloff Continues.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It seems all confidence in the stock market has slipped away for the moment, as economic risks mount and bond yields remain near highs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 654 points, or 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 dropped 3.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 4.3%.
At first, the blame was partly on a selloff in Treasuries, which had caused yields to spike.
It seems the stock market just isn’t finished reflecting the entirety of the risks.
Palantir Technologies (PLTR) stock dropped 21% after the company reported a profit of 2 cents a share, missing estimates of 4 cents a share, on sales of $446.4 million, above expectations for $443 million.

     Summary: Richard Drew/ASSOCIATED PRESSKey FactsThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2%, over 600 points, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 4.3%.
The wider market selloff continued on Monday as stocks struggled to find their footing and added to recent losses after moving lower for the last five weeks in a row.
Rates surged, putting pressure on stocks: The yield on the benchmark ten-year Treasury note jumped to 3.185%, its highest level since November 2018.
. . higher interest rates, higher inflation and higher geopolitical tensions remain the key headwinds facing the equity market and fixed income, and they don’t show many signs of abating at this point,” according to a note from Bespoke Investment Group.
The wider market selloff has been in large part driven by a decline in tech stocks, with nervous investors continuing to dump shares and turn to safe-haven assets.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wall Street’s relentless decline stretched into a sixth week on Monday, fueled by new data from China that added to concerns about a global economy that’s being battered by high inflation, rising interest rates and a malfunctioning supply chain.
The Euro Stoxx 600 fell 2.9 percent, and the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped 3.8 percent.
That could include raising interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point in one go, though he doesn’t think that is necessary right now.
One month of better data probably won’t be enough to calm markets, analysts say, but it could be a start.
Bear markets are similarly uncommon, with the last two having occurred in early 2020 and in the financial crisis before.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stocks extended their longest weekly losing streak in a decade Monday as Fed rate hike worries give way to stagflation bets and a renewed slump for the tech sector.
The region-wide Stoxx 600 was marked 2.8% lower by the close of trading in in Frankfurt trading while the FTSE 100 fell another 2.2% in London.
"US equity sentiment continues to be weak with S&amp;P 500 futures testing this morning the Friday lows around the 4,060 level, which is the key level to watch on the downside," the team added.
"If S&amp;P 500 futures close below 4,100 today it will be the lowest close since May 2021 and reinforcing the downward trend."
The CME Group's FedWatch tool suggests only a 12.6% chance of a 75 basis point Fed Funds increase next month.

     Stock market news live updates: Stock futures open slightly higher after S&amp;P 500 closes at lowest level since March 2021
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. equity futures edged slightly higher ahead of overnight trading Monday after stocks extended a sharp sell-off that sent all three major indexes to their lowest level year-to-date.
Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3% after the benchmark closed below 4,000 for the first time since March 2021, deepening losses from its longest streak of weekly declines since 2011.
The moves expand a period of recent turbulence for equity markets as worries around inflation, rising interest rates, and the possibility of an economic slowdown continue to weigh on investor sentiment.
As of Friday, the percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies beating EPS estimates was above the five-year average, but the magnitude of the upside surprises was below the five-year average, according to data from FactSet.
If it moves too slowly, it risks not tamping down inflation and having higher inflation expectations become embedded – making it more difficult to eliminate," Lynch noted.
