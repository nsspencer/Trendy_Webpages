     Summary: According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, Denver Nuggets superstar big man Nikola Jokic has won his second consecutive MVP award.
ESPN Sources: Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic voted the NBA’s MVP for a second consecutive season https://t.co/qN5VI0N96Q — Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) May 9, 2022Wojnarowski reports that a formal announcement is expected later this week.
It’s a weird time to drop the MVP news on a Monday morning, but nonetheless is awesome to now know that Jokic has for sure won MVP.
Jokic joins some elite company as he is just the 13th player in NBA history to win MVP in back-to-back seasons.
Congrats to Jokic, who has now made not only Nuggets history, but NBA history as well!

     Long live Nikola Jokić, the NBA’s Most VORPable Player
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last season, Jokić posted averages of 26.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, 8.3 assists per game.
And now Jokić will be etched into official NBA history as only the 13th player to win consecutive MVPs, but the timing couldn’t be worse.
Based on FiveThirtyEight’s Defensive RAPTOR statistic, Jokić had a greater impact on the defensive end this season than Utah’s Rudy Gobert.
Alternatively, ESPN’s Defensive Real-Plus Minus considers Gobert the best defender in the NBA, Jokić ranks sixth, Embiid is 15th and Antetokounmpo is 98th.
The framing of Jokić’s case for NBA MVP has legitimacy, but the stats-heavy narrative lacked soul.
