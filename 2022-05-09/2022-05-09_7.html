     Marcos, son of strongman, poised for Philippines election triumph
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Presidential aspirant Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the late dictator, waves after casting his vote in the 2022 national elections at Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in Batac, Ilocos Norte, Philippines, May 9, 2022.
Ferdinand Marcos Jr. clinched a stunning runaway victory in the Philippines' presidential election on Monday in the first win by a majority since a 1986 revolution that toppled his late father's two-decade dictatorship.
Marcos Jr. had 29.9 million votes, double that of Leni Robredo, the vice president, with 93.8% of the eligible ballots counted, according to the unofficial Commission on Elections (COMELEC) tally.
Marcos Jr. has served as a governor, congressman and senator, his sister, Imee, is currently a senator and mother Imelda, the influential power-broker and widow of the late dictator, served four terms in congress.
Marcos Jr.'s son Ferdinand Alexander was poised to win a seat in congress on Monday.

     Protests break out as Philippines election returns a Marcos to presidency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though Marcos, 64, campaigned on a platform of unity, political analysts say his presidency is unlikely to foster that, despite the margin of victory.
STUDENTS STAGE PROTESTAround 400 people, mostly students, staged a protest outside the election commission on Tuesday against Marcos and citing election irregularities.
A big win for Marcos was securing President Rodrigo Duterte's daughter, Sara Duterte-Carpio, as his vice presidential running mate.
Human rights group Karapatan called on Filipinos to reject the new Marcos presidency, which it said was built on lies and disinformation "to deodorize the Marcoses' detestable image".
As the vote count showed the extent of the Marcos win, Robredo told her supporters to continue their fight for truth until the next election.

     Philippines election 2022 looks set to make dictator's son Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. the president

     Summary: Presidential candidate Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the late dictator, waves after casting his vote in the 2022 national elections at Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in Batac, Ilocos Norte, Philippines, May 9, 2022.
President Ferdinand Marcos talks to journalists during his campaign in his northern home province of Ilocos Norte, Laoag, Philippines, in this December 17, 1985 file photo.
Willie Vicoy/REUTERSDespite that history, the dictator's son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who goes by his childhood nickname of "Bongbong," took a decisive early lead as the votes poured in Monday.
In 1986, the Philippines ousted the first Ferdinand Marcos after 21 years of authoritarian rule.
Analysts say Sara Duterte, the daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte and the mayor of Davao City, helped shore up support for Marcos Jr. by joining him on the ticket as his pick for vice president.

     Philippines election results: Bongbong Marcos Jr on cusp of winning landslide
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Official results, however, could take weeks to be confirmedKnown as "Bongbong" in the Philippines, Marcos Jr is the son of Ferdinand Marcos Sr, whose 21-year rule was marked by human rights abuses and widespread corruption.
Analysts say Marcos Jr's rise is the culmination of a decades-long attempt to rebrand the Marcos family's name and image, most recently through social media.
Marcos Jr ran on a platform of "unity" and has promised more jobs, lower prices, and more investment in agriculture and infrastructure.
Supporters of the Marcos family say the period was a time of progress and prosperity, characterized by the building of major infrastructure like hospitals, roads and bridges.
The Marcos family has repeatedly denied abuses under martial law and using state funds for their personal use.

     Provisional Results Show Landslide Marcos Victory in Philippine Election
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Get the NewsletterWhile these results have not been officially ratified by Comelec, it is clear that the Philippines has elected another Marcos and another Duterte by historic margins.
The margin of victory was accurately reflected in pre-election polls, which showed both Marcos and Duterte-Carpio far out front of the rest of the field.
The broader questions arising from Marcos’ victory concern the overall trajectory of Philippine politics, and how we perceive the global crisis of democracy.
In explanations of the Marcos phenomenon, much attention has focused on the historical revisionism engineered by the Marcos campaign, especially via social media, which has asserted the earlier Marcos reign as an era of stability and order.
But as I’ve noted before, the return of the once-shunned Marcos clan speaks to more profound social and political forces; disinformation alone can neither explain the Marcos victory, nor account for its massive scale.
