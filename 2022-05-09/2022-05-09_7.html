     Rivian stock plummets as Ford unloads 8 million shares of EV start-up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Production of electric Rivian R1T pickup trucks on April 11, 2022 at the company's plant in Normal, Ill.Shares of Rivian Automotive opened Monday at a new low following a CNBC report that Ford Motor is selling 8 million shares of the electric vehicle start-up.
CNBC's David Faber reported Saturday that Ford would sell 8 million of its Rivian shares through Goldman Sachs.
The Detroit automaker owned 102 million shares of Rivian.
Rivian said in March it expected to produce 25,000 electric trucks and SUVs this year, as the start-up battles through supply chain constraints and internal production snags.
That would be just half of the vehicle production it forecast to investors last year as part of its IPO roadshow.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 180-day "lockup" period, which prevented insiders and early investors from selling their Rivian shares, expired Monday.
CNBC reported on Saturday that Ford, which owns a 11.4% stake in Rivian, plans to sell 8 million of its 102 million shares.
JPMorgan Chase plans to sell between 13 million to 15 million Rivian shares on behalf of an unidentified seller, according to CNBC.
Amazon, which owns 162 million Rivian shares, is the company's largest stakeholder.
"The report of Ford selling 8 million shares is not what any Rivian investor wants to see," said Dan Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities.

     Rivian reports earnings Wednesday. Here's what we learned after 3 rivals reported last week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CEO RJ Scaringe warned investors in March that Rivian wouldn't be able to produce as many vehicles in 2022 as it had originally planned, despite a swelling order book.
The electric truck maker may also face questions about whether its largest investors — Amazon and Ford Motor — are losing confidence in the company.
Back in March, Rivian said it had about 83,000 reservations for its R1T pickup and R1S SUV.
Fisker won't begin production until mid-November, but both Lucid and Nikola have already had to reset expectations for this year's production totals.
Wall Street will be looking for an update on production capacity when the company reports this week.

     Why Rivian Stock Sank 39.8% in April but May Could Be Even Worse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a double-digit drop in March, Rivian shares tanked another 39.8% last month, according to data provided by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.
Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter, who cut Rivian's price target to $112 per share from $130 per share.
Barclays analyst Brian Johnson, who cut Rivian's price target to $38 per share from $42 per share.
But here's the thing: Ford owned roughly 102 million shares in Rivian and Amazon nearly 160 million as of last count.
If these companies dump these shares even in tranches, there's little that could stop Rivian shares from sinking further.
