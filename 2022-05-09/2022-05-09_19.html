     The ‘Candy’ Cast Introduces the Characters at the Center of a Shocking Crime (VIDEO)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A shocking crime shakes a Texas suburb in Candy, a drama based on true events from 1980.
But she falls under police suspicion after a violent attack on her church friend, Betty Gore (Melanie Lynskey) with whose husband Allan (Pablo Schreiber) she’s been having an affair.
“There were a lot of repressed emotions and desires and dreams and regrets and things that both of these women [had],” Biel says.
Lynskey’s character suffers from postpartum depression, and is a helper who earnestly wants everyone to feel happy and loved.
The moments where we got to act together were some of the best of my career.”Watch the video above for more from the cast.

     'Candy' turns infidelity and death into an old-fashioned true crime treat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Odd and tense, "Candy" burnishes Jessica Biel's crime-based limited series credentials, following her star-producer turn in "The Sinner."
Here, those two hats come in the service of an understated "whydunit" true crime yarn with all the trappings of a "Dateline" episode, which happily doesn't overstay its welcome at five episodes.
Like "Fargo," the small Texas town where this all unfolded is also a character, a place where people harbor grudges and live lives of quiet desperation while sitting beside those they've betrayed in church, wearing plastered-on smiles.
The victim, Betty Gore (Melanie Lynskey, fresh off "Yellowjackets") , is married to Allan (Pablo Schreiber), and her child and Candy's are friends.
Using a familiar device, "Candy" basically starts toward the ending and then works backward, portraying a community where everyone seems to be restless for different reasons, and a recreational volleyball team becomes the source of its own kind of mini-soap opera.

     Candy movie review &amp; film summary (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deeply dissatisfied by early ‘80s suburban ennui, Candy and Betty don’t realize how much they have in common.
And the easiest target is someone in her friend circle, Allan Gore (Pablo Schreiber), Betty’s husband.
And when she adopts a child with serious anger issues, Allan doesn’t really step to the plate to help out.
And the stellar Lynskey expresses the numbing depression of suburbia in a way that doesn’t feel clichéd.
The way Candy treats her affair like something else on her housewife to-do list is fascinating.

     Candy is a well-crafted story of murder &amp; desperate housewives
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Candy wisely focuses less on the details of the murder, and more on Candy and Betty (Melanie Lynskey, wearing an equally unflattering Dorothy Hamill ‘do), and the circumstances leading up to their bloody confrontation.
On the surface, though they’re both housewives in the same tiny everybody-knows-everybody’s-business town, they couldn’t be more different.
Candy is surrounded by adoring friends, while Betty is kept at a polite, passive-aggressive distance by the other women in town.
Though Candy definitely killed Betty, she successfully claimed self-defense, never wavering from her story about an enraged Betty attacking her first.
Perhaps Candy, fearful that Betty would tell Pat about the affair and destroy her perfect image, lashed out first.

     Candy Leaves a Sour Aftertaste
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Did Candy always want to be a housewife, or did her sense of adventure get tamped down at some point?
How did Candy and Pat, and Allan and Betty, meet and fall in love?
In the weeks or months between when Candy was arrested and when she faced trial, what did she go through?
There isn’t much illumination of interiority here on Betty’s part compared with Candy, and historically, that’s all the jury got too.
Instead, Candy ends with the sense that it used Betty too, revictimizing her and flattening her for its purposes.
