     Biden signs bill that aims to streamline U.S. military aid to Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. President Joe Biden signs into law S. 3522, the "Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022" at the White House in Washington, May 9, 2022.
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed a bill Monday that will streamline the lengthy process of supplying Ukraine with the military equipment needed for the fight against Russia.
"The cost of the fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression is even more costly," Biden added.
Biden's signature on the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 will make it easier for the U.S. to lend or lease military aid to allies affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Biden already has some power to lend or lease equipment, but the legislation he will sign into law will ease some of the requirements for doing so.

     Biden tells Congress to 'immediately' pass $40 billion Ukrainian aid bill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) President Joe Biden called on Congress to "immediately" pass a nearly $40 billion Ukrainian aid bill, warning for the first time that existing aid will run out in "approximately ten days."
Biden had urged Congress to pass $10 billion in additional pandemic relief funding and the massive new assistance to Ukraine in the same bill.
Biden initially requested $33 billion to help Ukraine as it fights Russia, but Congress has proposed billions more for food aid and military equipment.
"We cannot afford delay in this vital war effort," Biden said in the statement.
"Hence, I am prepared to accept that these two measures move separately, so that the Ukrainian aid bill can get to my desk right away."

So I call on Congress to pass the Ukrainian Supplemental funding bill immediately, and get it to my desk in the next few days.

     Biden announces partnership with internet providers to lower costs for low-income households
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden on Monday announced that 20 of the nation's internet providers have committed to lowering costs for low-income households, a step the administration says will increase access to high-speed internet for 48 million households nationwide.
"Over the last few months, my administration has worked closely with internet providers.
The announcement follows provisions in the administration's bipartisan infrastructure law to subsidize wireless internet for low-income families under the Affordable Connectivity Program, which reduces internet service costs for eligible families by up to $30 a month through grant funding.
Biden thanked the participating providers -- which include national names like AT&amp;T, Comcast, Frontier, Spectrum and Verizon, as well as more local providers such as Jackson Energy Authority and Ideatek.
The President said participating providers cover about 80% of the US population.

     Summary: AdvertisementThe House passed the lend-lease bill last month on a 417-to-10 vote.
The measure, introduced by a bipartisan group of senators, updates a 1941 law the United States used to help its allies during World War II.
“The Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 revives this pivotal program, waiving time-consuming requirements on the president’s authority to send critical defensive resources to Ukraine,” she said.
There, they met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, who thanked the United States for “helping to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity” of his country.
President Biden on April 28 proposed legislation for the United States to provide additional funding to support Ukraine in its defense from Russia’s invasion.

     Summary: As part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the President and Vice President worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which allows tens of millions of American households to reduce their internet service costs by up to $30/month (or $75/month on Tribal lands).
To ensure the most efficient use of those public dollars and to deliver maximum cost savings to families, the Biden-Harris Administration has secured commitments from 20 leading internet providers—covering more than 80% of the U.S. population across urban, suburban, and rural areas—to either increase speeds or cut prices, making sure they all offer ACP-eligible households high-speed, high-quality internet plans for no more than $30/month.

It’s a necessity,” President Biden said in remarks announcing the program at the White House Rose Garden.
Biden, during his 2020 campaign and in negotiations for the bipartisan infrastructure bill, has made Internet access a high priority, especially for rural America and low-income consumers.
The White House said it would partner with other federal agencies, state and city governments and charitable groups to spread the word.
That raises issues of price transparency, experts said, even as Monday’s announcement is a positive step for increasing Internet access.
