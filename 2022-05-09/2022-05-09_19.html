     Summary: Before a summer full of inevitable transactions, we are getting a sweet little taste — some transaction hors d’oeuvres — in the middle of the playoffs.
Announced by the team on Monday afternoon, the Minnesota Wild have signed prospect Pavel Novak to a three-year, entry-level contract that will start next season.
NEWS: We've signed Pavel Novak to a three-year, entry level contract.#mnwild — Minnesota Wild (@mnwild) May 9, 2022The 20-year-old Czech winger was drafted in the fifth round of the 2020 NHL Draft at 146th overall, and is yet another hopeful offensive tool that the Wild can add to their bulging cupboard of young players.
While playing for the WHL’s Kelowna Rockets this past season, Novak scored 29 goals and 72 points in 62 games.
Minnesota selected just five players in the 2020 draft, after moving around some picks and trying to get higher up the board, and it seems like they might get a decent haul now.

     Summary: The Minnesota Wild knew that after they embarrassed the St. Louis Blues on home ice, St. Louis was going to return in Game 4 with a lot of desperation.
When all was said and done, Minnesota’s patience cost them a commanding lead in the series with a chance to clinch at home in a decisive Game 5.
But the longer the Wild allowed the Blues to play their game, the worse it would get for Minnesota.
St. Louis called upon Binnington for Game 4 after riding Ville Husso the first three games.
“It’s the Minnesota Wild that didn’t get to our game quick enough,” Evason added.

     Summary: The front office work for a team never stops, even when they’re in the thick of a tight playoff series.
The Minnesota Wild have signed Pavel Novak to a three-year entry-level contract that starts next season.
Novak spent this season with the Kelowna Rockets of the WHL but saw his season end last month with a first-round defeat.
Novak, 20, was a fifth-round pick of the Wild in 2020, after his first season in North America.
Novak will be eligible to play in the AHL next season and his entry-level contract will kick in regardless of where he spends the year.

But it is if the Wild don’t want to head to St. Louis on Thursday facing elimination.

     Summary: After being extremely forthcoming about the Minnesota Wild lineup throughout the regular season, coach Dean Evason has been much more tight lipped with the playoffs underway.
It’s worth noting that Evason did confirm that Alex Goligoski was drawing into the lineup in Game 2, as well as the fact that there wouldn’t be any lineup changes for Game 3 or Game 4.
But Evason appears to be mum again with the Wild set to host the Blues in Game 5 on Tuesday night at Xcel Energy Center.
“We’re excited for tomorrow night,” Evason said of Game 5.
If the Wild win Game 5, that would give them some wiggle room heading into Game 6 in St. Louis.

     Summary: The Minnesota Wild were riding a high after a win in Game 3 but Game 4 did not start with the same kind of jump.
Wild Need Stick ControlApart from Game 1, the Wild have done well with controlling their sticks defensively, as they’ve blocked shots and poke-checked the puck away.
If the Wild can get those two things back under control, it’ll help as they head back home for Game 5.
Wild vs Blues Game 5The Wild will head back to Minnesota to take on the Blues for Game 5.
