     Bitcoin drops more than 10% on Monday, dips below $31,000 just days after topping $40,000
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bitcoin dropped more than 10% on Monday, dipping below $31,000 after touching a recent high of $40,000 last week.
The price of bitcoin dropped 10.5% at $30,953.94, according to Coin Metrics.
The cryptocurrency is at its weakest point since July when Bitcoin traded as low as $29,839.80 – the last time bitcoin traded below $30,000.
The crypto market, led by bitcoin, has remained highly correlated with the moves in equities, particularly tech stocks, for about a year.
"Equity and Crypto markets are selling off across the board due to a broad shift from risk-off to heavy risk-selling," said Steven McClurg, chief investment officer at Valkyrie Investments.
