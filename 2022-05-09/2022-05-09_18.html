     Giants release James Bradberry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants have released James Bradberry after failing to find a trade partner for him, the team announced on Monday.
Bradberry was slated to have a $21.8 million cap hit in the final year of his deal.
Bradberry’s release will cost the Giants $11.7 million in dead money but save them $10.1 million against the cap this season.
If Bradberry is designated as a post-June 1 release, the move will cost $10.4 million in dead cap this season but save $11.5 million.
Bradberry signed with the Giants in free agency in 2020 after playing four seasons with the Panthers to start his career.

     Summary: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The New York Giants released cornerback James Bradberry on Monday to save about $10.1 million against the salary cap this season.
Bradberry, 28, was set to make $13.5 million this season and would have counted as $21.9 million on the team's salary cap.
His release leaves the Giants thin at cornerback, where the oft-injured Adoree' Jackson is the only veteran with significant starting experience.
Bradberry had $2 million of his $13.4 million base salary guaranteed at the start of the league year.
The Giants signed him as a free agent in the 2020 offseason to a deal worth $43.5 million over three years.

     Giants Release CB James Bradberry After Two Seasons With Team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants released cornerback James Bradberry after failing to find a trade for the 2020 Pro Bowler, the team announced on Monday.
New franchise general manager Joe Schoen had been trying to work out a trade involving Bradberry since before free agency began in March this offseason.
Unfortunately, letting go of Bradberry also means that the Giants are forced to move on from one of their most reliable contributors on defense.
Bradberry spent the first four seasons of his NFL career with the Panthers before signing a three-year deal with the Giants during the 2020 offseason.

     BREAKING: NY Giants release cornerback James Bradberry: How they got here and what's next
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Athletic was first to report the news on Bradberry's departure, and the Giants made the release official soon after.
“It’s unfortunate because he’s a great kid,” Schoen said of Bradberry during an interview Wednesday on WFAN Radio.
Schoen did not want to release Bradberry, who turns 29 in August.
If Bradberry stays with a lower cap number, the Giants would have to do an extension, and Bradberry has no reason to accept anything less than market value.
The reality of having to release Bradberry is on the previous regime that left the cap situation the way it was when Schoen got here.
