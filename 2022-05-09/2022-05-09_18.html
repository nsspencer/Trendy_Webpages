     Summary: Will Lindholm or McAvoy play in Game 5?
Lindholm participated in Boston's morning skate Monday at Warrior Ice Arena, however, which is a sign of progress for the 28-year-old.
I'll get an update on him from the medical team," Cassidy told reporters Monday.
"So, I'm not going to rule him out [for Game 5] but I'm not putting him in either right now.
McAvoy was placed in COVID-19 protocols prior to Game 4, and while he's "feeling better," it's unlikely he'll be out of protocols in time to travel with the team to Carolina for Game 5.

     Boston Bruins Lindholm Practices, Not Ruled Out For Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BRIGHTON, MA – While it feels doubtful that Boston Bruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy will be able to return for Tuesday night’s Game 5, it appears that Hampus Lindholm might be a possibility to return for the Black and Gold.
Lindholm participated in an optional skate with the Boston Bruins at Warrior Ice Arena on Monday morning without any limitations and has not been ruled out from playing on Tuesday night at PNC Arena at this point, per Bruce Cassidy.
The Boston Bruins head coach did indicate that he wasn’t sure if Lindholm had been medically cleared to play as of yet, but that’s a status that could potentially change right up until puck drop in Carolina.
“I have to hear from the doctors that he’s cleared.
If he’s cleared, he’s in.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruins How the Bruins’ D overcame the loss of McAvoy and Lindholm in Game 4 Carolina's Antti Raanta and Boston's Connor Clifton vie for control of the puck in the second period of Game 4.
AP Photo/Steven SenneBruce Cassidy didn’t expect the cleanest of outings from his six defensemen entering Game 4 without Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm.
“I think collectively, we’re all going to pick up a couple more minutes,” Clifton said of the defensive approach without McAvoy and Lindholm.
In Game 4, the Bruins trotted out Clifton in crunch time to stave any potential Carolina comeback.
Forbort’s strength, PK, blocking shots, getting in the way has been good,” Cassidy said.

At the heart of those two wins was rookie goaltender Jeremy Swayman , who stopped 25 shots in Game 3 and 24 in Game 4.
