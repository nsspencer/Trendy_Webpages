     Summary: Rapper Young Thug is arrested on gang-related chargesEnlarge this image toggle caption Amy Harris/Amy Harris/Invision/AP Amy Harris/Amy Harris/Invision/APATLANTA — Rappers Young Thug was one of 28 people indicted Monday in Georgia on conspiracy to violate the state's RICO act and street gang charges, according to jail records.
The Atlanta rapper, whose name is Jeffrey Lamar Williams, was arrested at his home in Buckhead, an Atlanta neighborhood just north of downtown.
Young Thug is allegedly one of three founders of the Young Slime Life, "a criminal street gang that started in late 2012" in Atlanta, the indictment says.

Young Thug's record label has been called YSL Records or Young Stoner Life Records.

     Young Thug, Atlanta Rap Star, Is Arrested on Gang-Related Charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Contacted late Monday night, Drew Findling, a lawyer who has represented Mr. Williams in the past, declined to comment.
In April 2021, Ms. Willis charged a dozen people who were said to be members of gangs in that rival cluster, including Rayshawn Bennett, another famous rap artist whose stage name is YFN Lucci.
Mr. Bennett was indicted on, among other things, a felony murder charge in connection with a drive-by shooting.
Monday’s indictment charges three people accused of being YSL members with attempted murder in an attack on Mr. Bennett, who was stabbed in jail in February.
“If they committed acts of violence, and if we have enough evidence to substantiate that, you’re going to see indictments,” Ms. Willis said.

     Summary: Photo: Prince Williams/FilmMagicYoung Thug and Gunna are among 28 defendants connected to YSL who are facing charges in a 56-count indictment, according to WSB-TV reporter Michael Seiden.
The 88-page grand jury indictment released Monday describes YSL, the label and artists’ collective founded by Young Thug, as a “criminal street gang” affiliated with the national Bloods gang.
Prosecutors reportedly also alleged that two YSL associates sought Young Thug’s permission to make a second murder attempt on YFN Lucci.
The two Atlanta rappers have had beef since 2017, when Young Thug compared himself to Tupac.
Young Thug is reportedly scheduled to make his first appearance in court on Tuesday, May 10 at 11:30 a.m. “I’ll tell you the response to any allegation,” his defense attorney told WSB-TV.
