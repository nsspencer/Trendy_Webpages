     'Candy' on Hulu tells story of real-life murder that shocked the nation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Candy" is great reminder, but the new show also takes her acting career to a new level.
That's no exaggeration, because in real life, Montgomery was charged and stood trial for the brutal murder of Gore.
In fact, Biel and Lynskey give two of the most compelling and interesting performances on TV this year.
"Candy" isn't so much about death and mayhem as it is about characters pushed to their limits.
"Candy" streams on Hulu, owned by Disney, the same parent company as this ABC station.

     Hulu's Candy insults with sexist crime caper, worse wigs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The axe murder of Betty Gore isn’t the only attack on women in Hulu’s Candy, a screamingly sexist limited series even the most fervent true-crime fans can safely skip.
Candy kicks off with the sensational crime in question, though we don’t see exactly how Gore ended up so…well, gory until much later.
Told nonlinearly, Candy clumsily switches between before and after Gore’s death with minimal justification for why it does what when.
But as it stands, this series is a textbook example of how not to write women, reinforcing stereotypes instead of challenging them.
AdvertisementAfter Gore’s death, Lynskey’s clever characterization is reduced to shallow victim status, and Montgomery is further vilified as a teflon whore with a black heart.

     ‘Candy’ Episode 1 Recap: The Texas Chain Store Massacre
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unusually, Hulu is rolling out all five episodes of the limited series this week, one episode per day.
Shots of Betty’s house, its door shut, exist simply to remind you there’s a body inside.
Biel and Lynskey make for an interesting contrast as Candy and Betty respectively.
When he finally calls Candy to give her the bad news (“She’s been shot.” “…Shot?” Candy replies, confused.)
Candy looks like a bad dream, an earth-toned nightmare, with a title character who seems sweet enough, until your teeth rot away.

     Candy Leaves a Sour Aftertaste
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Did Candy always want to be a housewife, or did her sense of adventure get tamped down at some point?
How did Candy and Pat, and Allan and Betty, meet and fall in love?
In the weeks or months between when Candy was arrested and when she faced trial, what did she go through?
There isn’t much illumination of interiority here on Betty’s part compared with Candy, and historically, that’s all the jury got too.
Instead, Candy ends with the sense that it used Betty too, revictimizing her and flattening her for its purposes.
