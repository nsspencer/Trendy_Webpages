     Philippines Election 2022: Voting underway to decide next president
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite his family's horrific history of human rights violations and corruption, opinion polls predict Marcos Jr, also known as Bongbong, is likely to win the race.
The Marcoses pillaged the government for up to $10 billion, while thousands of his opponents were detained, tortured, and assassinated.
Around 18,000 positions are up for grabs, ranging from vice president to Senate and House of Representatives representatives to mayors, governors, and councillors.
After the polls shut at 7 p.m., an unofficial vote total might reveal the winner within hours.

     Dictator’s son Marcos takes overwhelming lead in Philippines election
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The election appeared to show the resounding success of a decade-long effort by the Marcos family to rehabilitate its name through an elaborate historical-revisionism campaign on social media.
Presidents serve only a single six-year term and are elected separately from the vice president.
During the campaign, Marcos and his running mate avoided discussing any concrete agenda, sticking to optimistic predictions for the future.
I just want to see my receipt.”Marcos’s main challenger is independent candidate Robredo, a vocal critic of Marcos and the elder Duterte — even though she was his vice president.
If Robredo’s grass-roots campaign is sustained after the election, it could become a major force in the opposition.

     Philippines election 2022 looks set to make dictator's son Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. the president
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Presidential candidate Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the late dictator, waves after casting his vote in the 2022 national elections at Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in Batac, Ilocos Norte, Philippines, May 9, 2022.
President Ferdinand Marcos talks to journalists during his campaign in his northern home province of Ilocos Norte, Laoag, Philippines, in this December 17, 1985 file photo.
Willie Vicoy/REUTERSDespite that history, the dictator's son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who goes by his childhood nickname of "Bongbong," took a decisive early lead as the votes poured in Monday.
In 1986, the Philippines ousted the first Ferdinand Marcos after 21 years of authoritarian rule.
Analysts say Sara Duterte, the daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte and the mayor of Davao City, helped shore up support for Marcos Jr. by joining him on the ticket as his pick for vice president.

     Philippines Live Updates: Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Appears Set for Sweeping Victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mr. Marcos’s supporters saw in him a glimmer of Mr. Duterte, whose strongman rule remains largely popular in the Philippines.
Many of them backed Mr. Marcos because Sara Duterte, Mr. Duterte’s daughter, ran for vice president on his ticket.
A victory for Mr. Marcos is likely to lead to democracy regressing further in the Philippines, where institutions have been obliterated or weakened under Mr. Duterte.
Just five years after Mr. Marcos’s family was forced to flee, the government allowed his family to return to the Philippines.
“I think he can solve everything,” said Chereen Nicole Rivera, a 21-year-old student who was celebrating Mr. Marcos’s win.

     Polls close in pivotal Philippines election that could put Marcoses back in power
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before voting began on Monday, opinion polls had Marcos Jr, known in the Philippines as Bongbong, as a clear frontrunner ahead of closest rival Robredo.
The Marcos family has repeatedly denied abuses under martial law and using state funds for their personal use.
Philippine presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr casts his vote at Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in Batac, Ilocos Norte on May 9.
The presidential race bears some similarities to the 2016 election, when Marcos Jr took on Robredo for the vice presidency.
On that occasion Marcos Jr lost, despite leading in the polls for most of the race.
