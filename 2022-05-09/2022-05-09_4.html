     'Candy' on Hulu tells story of real-life murder that shocked the nation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Candy" is great reminder, but the new show also takes her acting career to a new level.
That's no exaggeration, because in real life, Montgomery was charged and stood trial for the brutal murder of Gore.
In fact, Biel and Lynskey give two of the most compelling and interesting performances on TV this year.
"Candy" isn't so much about death and mayhem as it is about characters pushed to their limits.
"Candy" streams on Hulu, owned by Disney, the same parent company as this ABC station.

     Candy movie review &amp; film summary (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deeply dissatisfied by early ‘80s suburban ennui, Candy and Betty don’t realize how much they have in common.
And the easiest target is someone in her friend circle, Allan Gore (Pablo Schreiber), Betty’s husband.
And when she adopts a child with serious anger issues, Allan doesn’t really step to the plate to help out.
And the stellar Lynskey expresses the numbing depression of suburbia in a way that doesn’t feel clichéd.
The way Candy treats her affair like something else on her housewife to-do list is fascinating.

     Candy Premiere Recap: Death, Deception and Casserole — Grade It!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What made Monday’s debut of Hulu’s five-day limited series Candy, starring Jessica Biel, different and more engaging was, well, Jessica Biel.
Christina Gore is the best friend of Candy’s daughter Becky, and the little girl was staying at Candy’s house for a sleepover.
Candy was greeted by Christina’s maladroit mom Betty (played with awkward perfection by Melanie Lynskey), and then… we didn’t see what happened next.
Instead, an hour later, Candy was shown running from Betty’s house, jumping in her car and driving away.
Even without seeing Betty’s dead body, there was no doubt Candy had killed her.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hulu's new show "Candy" is based on the chilling real-life story of Candy Montgomery, a housewife.
Texas Monthly articles describe the killing of Betty Gore, whom Montgomery was accused of murdering.
Starring Melanie Lynskey as Gore and Jessica Biel as Candy Montgomery, Gore's friend turned killer, the chilling series will premiere Monday.
Here's everything to know about the real-life Montgomery and Gore ahead of the premiere of "Candy."
Jesse Plemons will star as Allan Gore in the forthcoming HBO show.

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘Candy’ On Hulu, Where Jessica Biel And Melanie Lynskey Star In A Dramatization Of The Candy Montgomery Case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first, Candy, starring Jessica Biel and Melanie Lynskey, will be rolled out by Hulu over five straight days, like an old-fashioned network miniseries.
The Gist: Candy Montgomery (Jessica Biel) seems to have everything together; she and her husband Pat (Timothy Simons) have a solid marriage, two kids, and a nice house in suburban Texas.
The story of Betty Gore’s killing at the hands of Candy Montgomery has been told in a number of true-crime docuseries, like Snapped.
Another series about this case, Love And Death, will debut on HBO Max later this year, with Elizabeth Olsen playing Candy Montgomery.
But, as we said, the idea behind this telling of the Montgomery case is how Candy came out of that seemingly mundane visit to Betty’s house and what led to it.

     Inside the grisly story of an axe killing that inspired new Hulu series ‘Candy’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Candy Montgomery wanted fireworks.
Candy Montgomery ran into Allan Gore – literally – during summer 1978, while both of them were playing on the church volleyball court.
Montgomery reportedly told Allan she was afraid the affair was getting too intense, but the relationship continued.
When Montgomery’s trial began in October 1980, her legal team didn’t seek to deny she had killed Betty Gore.
Candy Montgomery is believed to have also relocated and, according to the newspaper, to have earned a certification as a family counselor.

     Summary: Did Candy always want to be a housewife, or did her sense of adventure get tamped down at some point?
How did Candy and Pat, and Allan and Betty, meet and fall in love?
In the weeks or months between when Candy was arrested and when she faced trial, what did she go through?
There isn’t much illumination of interiority here on Betty’s part compared with Candy, and historically, that’s all the jury got too.
Instead, Candy ends with the sense that it used Betty too, revictimizing her and flattening her for its purposes.
