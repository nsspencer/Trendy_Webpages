     Summary: Stocks continued their selloff on Monday.
It seems all confidence in the stock market has slipped away for the moment, as economic risks mount and bond yields remain near highs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 654 points, or 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 dropped 3.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 4.3%.

     Stock market’s plunge continues on new concerns about global economy.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wall Street’s relentless decline stretched into another week on Monday, fueled by new data from China that added to concerns about a global economy that’s being battered by high inflation, rising interest rates and a malfunctioning supply chain.
The drop has stocks approaching a bear market, Wall Street’s term for a decline of 20 percent from the most recent record, which would serve as a marker of a severe shift in sentiment.
The concern rippled across global markets: Oil prices slid more than 6 percent, dragging shares of oil producers lower, while stocks in Europe and Asia also plunged.
The Euro Stoxx 600 fell 2.9 percent, and the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped 3.8 percent.
The Federal Reserve’s effort to cool the economy also means that a crutch for stock investors over the past two years, cheap borrowing costs and easy access to capital, is going to start to fade.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rising bond yields continued to pressure stocks as traders maintained their revolt against the Federal Reserve, doubting it can get inflation under control.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield on Monday topped 3.18% , after going above 3% last week for the first time since late 2018.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday tried to defend Moscow's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in a speech on "Victory Day," annual celebrations marking the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany.
Putin urged his forces on to success in Ukraine, saying there's a duty to remember those who prevailed in World War II.

     Summary: Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe stock market may not literally be the economy, but the distinction between the two is getting increasingly harder to draw.
So as the stock market goes through this volatile period, it's not sending a particularly good sign for the broader growth outlook.
"You could have argued a few decades ago that the stock market was not the economy, and that was very accurate.
No one would argue that the stock market is all of the economy, but it's also hard to dispute the notion that it's become a larger part of everyday life.
"If stock prices are down, it's much more difficult to raise equity.
