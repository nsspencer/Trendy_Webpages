     Summary: First lady Jill Biden met with Slovakian President Zuzana Čaputová on Monday during the last stop on her trip to Eastern Europe to highlight Russia’s invasion into Ukraine.
During their meeting at the presidential palace, Biden and Čaputová discussed support for the Ukrainian people and how the U.S. and Slovakia are joining forces to help.
Biden on Sunday made an unannounced visit to western Ukraine and met with first lady Olena Zelenska to show U.S. support for the embattled nation.
Earlier Sunday, she met with Ukrainian refugees at Ukraine’s border with Slovakia.
Ukrainian refugees have been able to receive basic services at the crossing before traveling to processing centers or transit hubs located further into Slovakia.

     Jill Biden completes 4-day Europe visit after surprise trip into Ukraine

     Summary: 1/4U.S. first lady Jill Biden meets on Monday with Slovakian President Zuzana Caputova in Bratislava before she departed for the United States.
Photo courtesy Zuzana Caputova/TwitterMay 9 (UPI) -- After a busy weekend in Eastern Europe -- which included a surprise visit to war-scarred Ukraine -- U.S. first lady Jill Biden departed Slovakia on Monday to return to the United States.
AdvertisementBefore departing, Biden briefly addressed her surprise trip in western Ukraine on Sunday -- saying that the trip over the border made an impression with her.
It was Biden's first official trip to Europe without President Joe Biden and just her second official visit anywhere, after her trip to Tokyo last summer for the Summer Games.
During her visit inside Ukraine, Biden met with Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska and expressed gratitude for Slovakia's efforts in supporting thousands of Ukrainian civilians who have fled the fighting in their home country.

     Jill Biden pays surprise visit to Ukraine, meets first lady

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jill Biden spent several hours in Ukraine, driving from the border with Slovakia to a town 10 minutes away to see first lady Olena Zelenska on Mother's DayUZHHOROD, Ukraine -- Jill Biden made an unannounced visit to western Ukraine, holding a surprise Mother’s Day meeting with first lady Olena Zelenska to show U.S. support for the embattled nation as Russia presses its punishing war in the eastern regions.
The women stepped out of their vehicles and embraced, with Biden — who wore a wrist corsage for Mother's Day — handing over a bouquet of flowers before they entered the school.
The visit allowed Biden to conduct the kind of personal diplomacy that her husband would like to do himself.
Her visit was to western Ukraine; Russia is concentrating its military power in eastern Ukraine, and she was not in harm’s way.
———This story has been corrected to reflect that the name of Ukraine's first lady is Olena Zelenska, not Zalenska.

     Day after visiting Ukraine, Jill Biden meets with Slovakian president
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First lady Jill Biden wrapped up her four-day trip to eastern Europe Monday by meeting with Slovakian President Zuzana Caputova in Bratislava, Slovakia.
LaRosa described their conversation as “more of a personal mother-to-mother exchange” and said Jill Biden was interested in how Zalenska was coping “through that lens.”He said Zalenska told Jill Biden that she was able to hold her children's hands every night even though she could not be with her husband.
“I cannot explain because I don’t know myself and I’m a teacher,” Victorie Kutocha, who had her arms around her 7-year-old daughter, Yulie, told Jill Biden.
Jill Biden also dropped in at a Slovakian public school that has taken in displaced students.
Slovakian and Ukrainian moms were brought together at the school for a Mother’s Day event while their children made crafts to give them as gifts.
