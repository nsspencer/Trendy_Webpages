     Hurricane Agatha: Mexico faces flooding, mudslides threat from storm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hurricane Agatha — the first 2022 hurricane in either the Atlantic or the eastern Pacific — came ashore in southern Mexico on Monday as a high-end Category 2 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center.
Threat level: "Although Agatha is weakening, life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rains are still possible through Tuesday," said the National Hurricane Center in a forecast discussion Monday night, after it became a tropical storm.
"Tropical storm conditions will continue within the warning area through Tuesday morning," it added.
Of note: Agatha was the strongest hurricane on record to strike land in the eastern Pacific during the month of May, according to the National Hurricane Center.
The first named Pacific hurricane of 2022 formed Sunday.

By 5:00 pm PT, the hurricane's maximum sustained winds decreased to about 80 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.
