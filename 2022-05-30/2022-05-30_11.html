     DeLorean EV: First Look at Electric Alpha5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeLorean Motor Company has revealed the first full look at the Alpha5 — and this sucker is electric.
Inspired by the classic DMC-12 of the 1980s, the next generation DeLorean Alpha5 is a four-seater with a 100+kWh battery powering "multiple electric motors."
Early access subscribers received the first look on Monday, one day before DeLorean Motor Company's redesigned website goes public worldwide.
"The Alpha5 is a representation of the past 40 years of DeLorean," Troy Beetz, Chief Marketing Officer of DeLorean Motor Company, said in a statement.
The DeLorean EV Alpha5 will officially be unveiled Thursday, August 18, at the Awards Ramp at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.

     DeLorean is back from the future with a luxury electric vehicle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The iconic car brand DeLorean, from the Back to the Future franchise, is back with an electric vehicle: Alpha5.
The original DeLorean came out as a limited edition car in 1981, before the DeLorean Motor Company went bankrupt in 1982.
A few months later, DeLorean Motor Company confirmed the rumors and announced that the DeLorean will come back as a luxury EV.
DeLorean has partnered with the design firm which worked on the original DeLorean, Italdesign, to design the Alpha5 model.
Unfortunately, that is all we know about this new luxury electric vehicle as it won't be unveiled until the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance in August.

     DeLorean offers a first look at its gull-winged Alpha 5 EV revival
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeLorean Motor Company has revealed the first images of the Alpha 5 electric vehicle (EV), the brand’s attempt at resurrecting the DeLorean name in an all-electric form.
Before we dive into the details, it’s worth noting the company behind the Alpha 5 isn’t actually the same one behind the original DeLorean vehicles — that company went defunct in 1982.
An unrelated Texas-based company, which supplies replacement parts to the owners of vintage DeLorean vehicles, snapped up the rights to the DeLorean brand and teased an all-electric revival in April.
Grid View Image: DeLoreanImage: DeLoreanImage: DeLoreanImage: DeLoreanImage: DeLoreanThe Alpha 5 could come with a 100kWh battery, offering an estimated 300 miles of range and a top speed of 155mph.
DeLorean indicates these specs will belong to the “base” performance model, but there isn’t any word on other possible performance tiers or pricing.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The original DeLorean came out in 1981, and about 9,000 cars were made.
This new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company, founded in 1995, actually shares no relation to the original DeLorean Motor Company, which was founded by John DeLorean in 1975 and went bankrupt in 1982.
The new company acquired the old company’s logo and parts inventory and has mostly worked as a service and restoration company for old DeLorean cars since then.
While it is a whole new company, DeLorean has partnered with Italdesign, the design firm that worked on the original DeLorean, to design the Alpha5.
Despite its provenance as the futuristic star vehicle of the Back to the Future series of movies, the original DeLorean had a pretty standard V6 engine.

     Summary: The DeLorean Alpha V, as it’s officially known, looks absolutely nothing like the original DeLorean DMC-12.
That's where the similarities end, however, because the DeLorean Alpha V is very much a modern coupé.
(Image credit: DeLorean Motor Company)So what sort of specs can we expect from the Alpha V?
The Alpha V will also feature a four seat layout, though there doesn't seem to be much legroom back there.
The DeLorean Alpha V won’t go into production until sometime in 2024, and we don’t know how much it’s likely to cost.

     Summary: The DeLorean is back as an all-electric 2+2 grand tourer with striking looks signed by Italdesign and exhilarating performance.
It's called Alpha5 and it spearheads an entire lineup from the revived brand, which will include an electric sedan, hydrogen SUV and a V8 coupe.
As the photos can attest, the DeLorean Alpha5 is a major departure from the original DMC-12.
As for performance, the Alpha5 "base performance model"—this suggests more potent models are in the pipeline—packs a 100+kWh battery powering "multiple electric motors."
The DeLorean Alpha5 will make its official public debut at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance on August 18 before entering production in 2024 at an undisclosed location in Italy.

     Summary: John Z. DeLorean was once a god in the world of American automobiles.
In 1973, he left General Motors to found DMC, the DeLorean Motor Company, which took almost a decade to bring its first car to market.
The big car companies are falling all over themselves to prepare for the inevitable transition to electric cars.
The DeLorean brand may still be snakebit by an incident that happened years ago when John Z. tried to set up a factory in Northern Ireland.
But when it came time to stake out the site for the factory, John Z. himself selected the location.
