     Norm Macdonald says goodbye in a Netflix special, with a little help from his friends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The posthumous release provides a fitting and deeply personal tribute, as well as a primer on the art of stand-up.
Netflix has packaged Macdonald's performance, which runs a little over 50 minutes, with a half-hour discussion featuring six of his friends: Dave Chappelle, David Letterman, Adam Sandler, David Spade, Conan O'Brien, and Molly Shannon, who spend another 30 minutes or so reminiscing about him while deconstructing what viewers just saw.
Chappelle calls the stark setting "very endearing," while Letterman notes that without an audience to respond to the material, "We weren't watching standup comedy.
Without that audience, you don't get the full measure of Norm."
While Macdonald knew his time might be short, there's nothing morbid or maudlin about the presentation, which essentially trains a camera on his face and lets him rip.

     Norm Macdonald’s Nothing Special: a standup says farewell
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After two years of closed venues and Zoom comedy gigs, I’m in no hurry to ever again watch standup delivered to absent audiences.
But I’ll make an exception for Norm Macdonald, whose Nothing Special, performed to no one, lands on Netflix today.
There’s a symmetry at play here, given that the first viral comedy set of the coronavirus era was Macdonald’s, at the Hollywood Improv the day before the US went into lockdown.
In Nothing Special, you see what happens when a constitutionally private man uses comedy to both process, and defy, his imminent mortality.
It’s a laugh that will last as long as audiences watch Macdonald’s comedy.

     Norm MacDonald’s Colleagues Discuss Comedian’s Death in Netflix Special: We Didn’t Get to ‘Tell Him What He Meant to Us’

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During their conversation, several of them admitted they didn’t know the star, who died in September 2021 after a nine-year battle with cancer, was sick.
“I don’t know how everyone else felt here, but Norm was sick for quite a while, and he got sicker and I didn’t know and I talked to so many people who I was sure knew,” O’Brien said.
Is there something I did?’ because we kept trying to get him to come back on and we couldn’t.
| ChartsChappelle also said he didn’t know that MacDonald was sick.
And there’s a picture of me and him and the back of Chris Rock’s head — I put it in my special,” Chappelle said.
