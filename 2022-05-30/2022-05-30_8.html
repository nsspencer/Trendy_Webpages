     Norm Macdonald says goodbye in a Netflix special, with a little help from his friends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The posthumous release provides a fitting and deeply personal tribute, as well as a primer on the art of stand-up.
Netflix has packaged Macdonald's performance, which runs a little over 50 minutes, with a half-hour discussion featuring six of his friends: Dave Chappelle, David Letterman, Adam Sandler, David Spade, Conan O'Brien, and Molly Shannon, who spend another 30 minutes or so reminiscing about him while deconstructing what viewers just saw.
Chappelle calls the stark setting "very endearing," while Letterman notes that without an audience to respond to the material, "We weren't watching standup comedy.
Without that audience, you don't get the full measure of Norm."
While Macdonald knew his time might be short, there's nothing morbid or maudlin about the presentation, which essentially trains a camera on his face and lets him rip.
