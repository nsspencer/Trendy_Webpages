     Summary: It was fitting the winner of the inaugural Larry Bird Eastern Conference Finals MVP awards was a member of the Boston Celtics.

I thank God every day just to be in this position to be able to do that.
To be the first person to win this award, obviously, after Larry Bird, it still hasn‚Äôt like sunk in yet.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum won the inaugural Larry Bird MVP for the Eastern Conference Finals, and the Boston Celtics are on their way to a Finals showdown against the Golden State Warriors.
‚ÄúI still feel like a kid sometimes that I‚Äôm truly living out my dream,‚Äù said Tatum during the postgame press conference.
After losing Game 6 at TD Garden, Tatum was asked how he came into Game 7 so confident.
It‚Äôs the Celtics‚Äô first trip to the Finals since 2010 when they lost to the Kobe Bryant-led Lakers.
Tatum wore an armband, and shoes, and watched film of his childhood hero before his game for inspiration.

     YouTube Gold: Larry Bird Being Funny
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Boston Celtics back in the NBA Finals for the first time in 12 years, we thought it would be a great time to see some (you guessed it) Larry Bird footage.
Larry Bird had a reputation as one of the great trash talkers of all time.
This time, it‚Äôs about a less renowned but still impressive Bird talent.
Normally taciturn and always guarded, Bird has also always had a tremendous sense of humor.
This video is a compilation of commercials, talk show appearances, award ceremonies and ragging on Magic Johnson and Charles Barkley.

     Jayson Tatum Wins Larry Bird Trophy As Eastern Finals MVP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the Celtics‚Äò dramatic victory over the Heat in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Sunday, Jayson Tatum was named the Most Valuable Player of the series, making him the first-ever winner of the Larry Bird Trophy, according to the league (Twitter press release).
The NBA introduced the award earlier this month in an effort to honor the players who played crucial roles in leading their teams to the Finals.
Last week, Warriors star Stephen Curry became the first player to win the Magic Johnson Trophy award as the MVP of the Western Conference Finals.
Tatum earned eight of nine votes, with Heat star Jimmy Butler receiving the only other vote, from ESPN‚Äôs Tim Bontemps.
Tatum will look to carry over his Eastern Finals success into the NBA Finals vs. the Warriors.

‚ÄúIt's an honor,‚Äù Tatum said after the game while sitting at a podium with his new trophy by his side.
Well-deserved all the accolades he's getting and he's only 24 and not even touched his ceiling, not even close to that.
We know we've still got a long way to go.‚ÄùAs thrilled as he was to earn the inaugural Bird trophy, Tatum's mind is on another piece of "Larry" hardware.
Up next: the Larry O'Brien trophy.
