     Canada's Trudeau announces bill to cap sales, transfers and imports of all handguns in the country
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday announced the introduction of a bill that would place a national freeze on handgun ownership across Canada.
"What this means is that it will no longer be possible to buy, sell, transfer or import handguns anywhere in Canada," Trudeau said in a news conference.
"In other words we're capping the market," he added.
If passed, the new anti-gun legislation will fine gun smuggling and trafficking "by increasing maximum criminal penalties and providing more tools for law enforcement to investigate firearm crimes," Trudeau said.
The new legislation would also require that long gun magazines "can never" hold more than five rounds.

     Summary: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters the new measures were needed as gun violence was increasing.
Canada has stronger gun legislation than the United States but while its gun homicide rate is less than one-fifth the U.S. rate it is higher than that of other rich countries and has been rising.
The new laws would also ban some toys that look like real guns, such as airsoft rifles.

     Invoking Uvalde, Trudeau out to freeze handgun sales

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The tragedy prompted Trudeau to announce an immediate ban on 1,500 types of what his government calls “assault-style” weapons, including semi-automatic firearms designed to fire quickly.
Canada has seen an increase in gun violence in recent years.
And gun violence accounted for less than three percent of all violent crime reported to police in 2020, according to Statistics Canada.
Earlier this month, survey results from the Angus Reid Institute showed that 60 percent of respondents believe gun violence is rising in Canada.
“They only care about wedging and dividing Canadians.”The Statistics Canada report pointed to data gaps around gun violence, including whether the weapons were legally obtained.

     Summary: “We are, however, facing a level of gun violence in our communities that is unacceptable.”AdvertisementThe proposed legislation came after mass shootings in Texas and across the U.S.-Canada border in Buffalo in recent weeks have revived a long-simmering debate in the United States about whether Congress might act to curb gun violence.
“Unfortunately, the reality is in our country [gun violence] is getting worse and has been getting worse over the past years,” Trudeau said.
The Liberals pledged stricter gun-control measures if reelected.
The Liberal Party typically employs guns as a wedge issue during federal election campaigns, painting their Conservative counterparts as supportive of easing gun-control measures to gain an edge.

     Canada PM proposes complete freeze on sale, purchase of handguns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington, May 30 (EFE).- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Monday proposed a complete freeze on the sale and purchase of new firearms after an 18-year-old gunman shot dead 19 students and two teachers at a school in the United States.
Trudeau introduced a bill in parliament that would tighten gun control in Canada and freeze private ownership of all short-barrelled firearms by making it illegal to buy them.
He said that “one Canadian killed by gun violence is one too many,” justifying the ban on 1,500 types of military-style assault firearms.
“I have seen all too well the tragic cost that gun violence has in our communities across the country.
Handguns were the most serious weapon present in the majority of firearm-related violent crimes (59 percent) between 2009 and 2020.
