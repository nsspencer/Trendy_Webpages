    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mr. Hawkins was born in Huntsville, Ark., on Jan. 10, 1935 and studied physical education at the state university, where he excelled as a promising athlete.
While performing with his first bands, doing gymnastic splits, backflips and even double backflips, he soon earned the nickname “Jumpin’” Ronnie Hawkins, and later “Rompin’” Ronnie.
Mr. Hawkins called Canada “the promised land” because he found its bars safer and more lucrative than those in the American South.
One version has Mr. Hawkins trying to buy the luxury car, only to be rebuffed by a salesman who doubted his ability to pay for such an automobile, leaving Mr. Hawkins to return with a paper bag containing $18,500 in crisp hundred-dollar bills.
Two years later, Mr. Hawkins’s status as a legend in Canadian rock history was secured with his induction into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame.
