     Swiatek extinguishes Zheng's fire to reach French Open last eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Poland's Swiatek, who will next face American 11th seed Jessica Pegula, is unbeaten since last February, claiming titles on clay in Stuttgart and Rome.
The 20-year-old is on the longest unbeaten run in the women's tour since Serena bagged 34 victories in succession in 2013.
"She's playing amazing tennis," Swiatek said of Zheng.
Swiatek broke for 2-0 and kept her advantage throughout the first set although she rushed things at time.
She picked herself up to fight back in the third but the Swiatek express train was already going full speed and the Pole wrapped it up when Zheng's backhand sailed long.

     Summary: 1 Iga Swiatek overcame a huge scare to beat Qinwen Zheng in the French Open fourth round and take her winning run to 32 matches.
Swiatek dropped her first set of the tournament when 19-year-old Zheng saved five set points before rallying from 5-2 down in the tie-break to win the next five points.
AdThe prospect of a shock merely clicked Swiatek into gear, however, as the 2020 champion responded with a bagel in the second set before winning the decider 6-2.
- Zheng nails serve and volley to surprise SwiatekAfter a comfort break, Swiatek came out firing at the start of the second set, breaking immediately to lay down an early marker.
Zheng hoped to hit back, but after seeing two break points come and go she was then broken to love for a second straight time.
