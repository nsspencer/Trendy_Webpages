     Holger Rune dumps out Stefanos Tsitsipas as young guns shine at Roland Garros
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The so-called ‘next generation’ of men’s tennis is in danger of being usurped by an even newer breed at this year’s French Open after Stefanos Tsitsipas was sent packing by Danish teenager Holger Rune.
Greek fourth seed Tsitsipas, runner-up 12 months ago, is one of a handful of players still waiting to step in when the powers or physical health of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and, notionally, Roger Federer, finally begin to wane.
But the 23-year-old was outplayed by Rune, competing at Roland Garros for the first time, in a shock 7-5 3-6 6-3 6-4 defeat.
Rune joins fellow 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals, the first time two teenage men have reached that stage of a grand slam since the 1994 French Open.
Now that they have beaten me I want payback.”Medvedev does have a grand slam title to his name having won the US Open last year.

Like Tsitsipas Rune is a student of the Mouratoglou Academy, where he has trained since his early teens, and a contest against its talisman carried greater significance.
As Rune tried to serve out Tsitsipas in the fourth set, he finally felt the weight of the moment.
Stefanos Tsitsipas had no answer to Holger Rune’s deep returns and delicate drop shots.
Asked about Rune’s best qualities, Tsitsipas described Rune’s backhand as “very consistent, very precise,” but his compliment was backhanded: “But he gets tight.
