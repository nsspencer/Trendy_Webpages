     Summary: The title matchup is set: It’ll be Udoka and the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics facing Kerr and the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors, a series that begins Thursday night in San Francisco.
The Warriors have been waiting for an opponent since this past Thursday after needing only five games to beat Dallas for the West title.
The Celtics got there the hard way, winning Game 7 in Miami on Sunday night to capture the East.
We made a commitment on the defensive end,” said Celtics forward Al Horford, who, after 141 playoff games, is headed to the NBA Finals for the first time.
It’s also a rematch of the 1964 finals, when Bill Russell and the Celtics topped the Warriors in five games.

     Summary: When the year started it definitely did not look like a Boston vs. Golden State Finals was likely.
NBA Finals odds and thoughtsGolden State -160Boston +130Picking the outright winner of a seven-game series is usually the least interesting kind of bet you can make.
In recent Finals wins for Golden State, the MVP has been claimed by Kevin Durant twice and Andre Iguodala.
One thing you cannot debate, though, is that Golden State has the homecourt advantage and has the more experienced roster.
Now if Boston wins that is a whole other situation but that is why they call it gambling.
