     The Bob’s Burgers Movie review – delightfully weird and comfortable in it’s own skin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I have never seen an episode of the long-running Fox animated series Bob’s Burgers.
Loren Bouchard’s ode to anyone unafraid to let their freak flag fly, no matter how cumbersome, is a breath of awkward fresh air.
The Bobs Burgers Movie is so delightfully weird, off-kilter, and steadfast in its quirk that it keeps a smile on your face for much of the bewildering ride.
Bob’s Burgers gets The Simpsons treatment with its movie that centers around the floundering burger joint with another pothole in the road.
He was arrested for murder when the children stumbled upon a dead body hidden at the bottom of the hole.

     The Bob’s Burgers movie may change season 13 opening, say creators
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bob’s Burgers Movie is a lot of things.
Since its release in 2011, we have seen Bob’s Burgers have the same opening sequence.
Before an episode of the animated series begins, the Belcher family stand outside their restaurant for its grand opening.
In response, Bouchard heavily hinted that the change was coming, as continuity in the world of Bob’s Burgers is something the team always considers.
The Bob’s Burgers Movie is out in cinemas now.

     Bob’s Burgers Fails To Learn From The Simpsons Movie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: THEGAMER VIDEO OF THE DAYAt its simplest, The Simpsons Movie feels like a movie, while The Bob’s Burgers Movie feels like a long episode of Bob’s Burgers.
The Bob’s Burgers Movie is ultimately a comedy, and it made me laugh out loud a dozen or so times.
This comparison doesn’t really exist with The Simpsons Movie because it’s not an episode of The Simpsons, it’s just the best Simpsons movie we have.
The Bob’s Burgers Movie is a great time if you’re a Bob’s Burgers fan, but it doesn’t feel any different from watching three or four great Bob’s Burgers episodes in a row.
I’m glad it’s here, and I know fans will enjoy it, but it feels like a shame that even with The Bob’s Burgers Movie in theatres, we don’t actually have a Bob’s Burgers movie to enjoy.

The Bob's Burgers Feature film got hit with many covid delays in its production and release: but it was worth the wait!
It's incredible what a bigger budget can do for production, and Bob's Burgers is no different.

     The Bob’s Burgers Movie REVIEW – Comfort Food
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The premise of The Bob’s Burgers Movie feels like a natural escalation of the usual misadventures of downbeat burger-slinger Bob Belcher (H. Jon Benjamin), his perpetual optimist wife Linda (John Roberts) and their family.
The plot does bear resemblance to a few previous episodes, and consequently it feels at times like The Bob’s Burgers Movie’s trying to rehash some of its greatest hits.
That’s not to say Bob’s Burgers has lost its charm – this movie is as gut-bustingly funny as the show has ever been.
The Bob’s Burgers Movie may not push the envelope or push its characters into a brand new world, but it does deliver an exciting adventure that rockets through its runtime with no drag.
It’s sincere without being saccharine, heartfelt without being hokey, and a sure crowd-pleaser for fans and Bob’s Burgers newbies alike.

     Polygon eats Bob’s burgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bob’s Burgers Movie is hitting theaters this weekend (read our review!
Here at Polygon, we decided the best way to commemorate the occasion was by picking a few burgers out of the official Bob’s Burgers Burger Book to cook and sample at home.
Six of our intrepid staffers picked a burger that sang to them (not quite literally, although you never know with Bob’s Burgers) and set out to make them at home.
I know you have a passion for burgers and for food in general.
We also ate it while watching Spy x Family, and eating a burger from Bob’s Burgers while watching a different animated show about a dysfunctional family at work was perfect.
