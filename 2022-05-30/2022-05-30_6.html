     Summary: A man in a wig was detained after throwing a piece of cake at the Mona LisaEnlarge this image toggle caption Thibault Camus/AP Thibault Camus/APA man who seems to have been disguised as an old woman in a wheelchair threw a piece of cake at the Mona Lisa in Paris.
Another video showed someone clearing the cake off the glass protecting the Mona Lisa, as onlookers held up their phones to film the incident's aftermath.
The original Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1519.
In 1911, the Mona Lisa disappeared from the museum.
"So the Mona Lisa was recovered — and her fame was all the greater," the Louvre says on its website.

     Summary: Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNNThe "Mona Lisa" was the subject of attempted vandalism on Sunday when a visitor to the world-famous Louvre museum in Paris smeared frosting all over the Renaissance-era painting's protective glass.
"A visitor simulated a disability in order to use a wheelchair to approach the work, which was installed in a secure display case.
"While standing near the painting, this individual threw a pastry he had hidden in his personal belongings at the Mona Lisa's glass case.
A visitor to the Louvre smeared cake on the glass protecting the Mona Lisa.
In 2009, a woman angrily threw a ceramic cup at the painting, breaking the cup but leaving the painting unharmed.

     Suspect arrested after Mona Lisa smeared with cream cake
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‘Think of the Earth, people are destroying the Earth,’ man dressed in a wig said as he was being led away from the Louvre Museum.
The Mona Lisa survived unharmed when a visitor to the Louvre in Paris tried to smash the glass protecting the world’s most famous painting before smearing cake across its surface in an apparent environment-related publicity stunt.
The cake attack left a conspicuous white creamy smear but the famous work by Leonardo da Vinci was not damaged.
Then proceeds to smear cake on the glass, and throws roses everywhere all before being tackled by security.
The Mona Lisa has been behind glass since a Bolivian man threw a rock at the painting in December 1956, damaging her left elbow.

     Man in wig throws cake at Mona Lisa in climate protest stunt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An activist targeted Leonardo Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa on Monday, throwing cake at the portrait inside the Louvre Museum in Paris.
Sergio Migliaccio, a witness to the incident, said the man was in a wheelchair wearing a long wig amid the crowd of people there to see the famed painting.
“All of a sudden the guy jumped from the wheelchair and, with a red rose between his lips, he climbed the fences and attacked the Mona Lisa with a cake,” Migliaccio said.
The painting hangs behind a layer of glass, leaving it unharmed by the cake.
It was also damaged in an acid attack perpetrated by a vandal in the 1950s, and has since been kept behind glass.
