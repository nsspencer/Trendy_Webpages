     You May See a New Meteor Shower in Night Skies, or Nothing at All
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To catch the shower, get away from bright city lights and find the darkest and clearest location you can, one with few hills or other obstacles on the horizon.
The moon will be new that night, so its light will not interfere with the display.
The Tau Herculids, the meteor shower from SW3, was predicted to come from the constellation Hercules — hence the shower’s name — a forecast that has since turned out to be incorrect.
The first bright star you see should be Arcturus.
Unlike meteor showers that are visible for days before and after a peak night, this show will not last long, if it occurs at all.

     Tau Herculids meteor shower may light up night sky over North America
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Earth is expected to pass through the debris trail of a broken comet on Monday night and early Tuesday morning.
Night sky watchers in North America have the best chance of seeing the tau Herculid shower, with NASA recommending around 1 a.m. on the East Coast or 10 p.m. on the West Coast as the best times to look up.
However, there's no guarantee of a dazzling display even if the sky is clear and dark, NASA stressed.
The comet, officially known as 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann, or SW3, was discovered in 1930 by German observers Arnold Schwassmann and Arno Arthur Wachman.
It wasn't spotted again until the late 1970s and in the 1990s the comet shattered into several pieces, NASA said.

     Calling all stargazers: Rare meteor shower possible Monday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) — A rare and potentially “spectacular” meteor shower may streak across the sky late Monday night, according to NASA.
The Tau Hercluids meteor shower is expected to peak at 1 a.m. Tuesday.
The visibility of the meteor shower all depends on the speed of the debris as the comet passes through Earth’s atmosphere.
“If the debris from SW 3 was traveling more than 220 miles per hour when it separated from the comet, we might see a nice meteor shower.
Stargazers have the best chance of seeing the meteor shower under clear, dark skies that are as far away from light pollution as possible.

     Meteor shower possible overnight: Where, when to watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AUSTIN (KXAN) — A meteor shower is possible overnight from Memorial Day into Tuesday.
What is it: The tau Herculids shower, which is forecast to peak overnight, was first discovered as a comet back in 1930, according to NASA.
If the debris from SW3 was traveling more than 220 miles per hour when it separated from the comet, we might see a nice meteor shower.
Where to watch: If this shower is visible, it’s likely you’ll be able to see it from Central Texas.
Tips: NASA says the best way to catch a meteor shower is to get as far away from light pollution as possible (sorry downtown Austin dwellers) and find the darkest patch of sky that you can.
