     Worcesteria: Memorial Day, and the echo of gunfire ...
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Every Memorial Day, I find myself mulling one of the few photographs I have of my father taken during the Vietnam War.
I say “boys” because now, at the age of 50, I can see that's what my father was at the time.
A PLACE TO REFLECT: The pool at the Vietnam War Memorial at Green Hill Park is filled with large tadpoles right now, clearly on the brink of becoming frogs, and there are bright patches of yellow flowers scattered along its perimeter.
On the sunny Sunday before Memorial Day, children play, families take photos and one or two people solemnly and silently read the names of Worcester's war dead, forever etched in stone.
When I'm at the memorial, those thoughts resonate with something else, something ephemeral.

     Summary: Memorial Day offers an opportunity to do something good when you see the OBX V.F.W.
We are grieving for the families who lost their little ones and adult family members, too, and I for one need to vent.
No matter how you spend your Memorial Day, we will be thinking of you; we will be grateful for the tremendous sacrifice of your loved one and we will honor them on this dedicated day of remembrance.
Hug tightly the ones you love that are still here with you; put old family conflicts aside and do your best to forgive and hopefully forget.

As the U.S Census recently reported:Memorial Day, originally called Decoration Day, is a day of remembrance for those who died in service to their country.
It became an official federal holiday in 1971, known as Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day.
The loans are offered through retailers nationwide, including auto mechanics, furniture stores, and pet stores and are packed with deceptive provisions designed to entrap borrowers.
If members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation are serious about honoring veterans, they should sign on as co-sponsors to this important bill right away.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2017, seven states – Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia – chose to also celebrate some form of Confederate Memorial Day.
Editor’s note: Three states — Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina — still had a Confederate Memorial Day on their calendars in 2022, according to Newsweek.
It surfaces daily as communities such as New Orleans wrestle with whether or not to keep memorial statues honoring Confederate leaders like Robert E. Lee.
In “Facing It,” a poem about visiting the Vietnam War Memorial, Komunyakaa, an African-American, confronts the wall and issues linked to war and race.
They also point to how those remaining alive, particularly those who have not served, might come to understand the depth of the sacrifice expressed by memorials and, by extension, Memorial Day.

Deeply emotional moments in my career involving the fallen and their families often play out in my memories as I reflect upon the true meaning of Memorial Day.
I will never forget looking into their eyes and promising never to forget their fallen loved ones — my fellow airmen.
To Gold Star families: My heart is with you on this sacred day — today and every day.

     Raising a red flag on Memorial Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wisconsin Republicans’ obsession with increasing the proliferation of guns has reached the point where they don’t even justify it in practical terms anymore.
The idea that mass shootings are unavoidable is simply a lie.
We endured 214 mass shootings within the first 145 days of 2022 — more than one per day.
As Republicans push for less and less regulation and more and more guns, gun violence keeps going up.
On Memorial Day, we need people of all political persuasions to stand up against this deeply distorted view of American patriotism.
