     Man in wig throws cake at Mona Lisa in climate protest stunt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An activist targeted Leonardo Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa on Monday, throwing cake at the portrait inside the Louvre Museum in Paris.
Sergio Migliaccio, a witness to the incident, said the man was in a wheelchair wearing a long wig amid the crowd of people there to see the famed painting.
“All of a sudden the guy jumped from the wheelchair and, with a red rose between his lips, he climbed the fences and attacked the Mona Lisa with a cake,” Migliaccio said.
The painting hangs behind a layer of glass, leaving it unharmed by the cake.
It was also damaged in an acid attack perpetrated by a vandal in the 1950s, and has since been kept behind glass.
