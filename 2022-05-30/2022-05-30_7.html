     You May See a New Meteor Shower in Night Skies, or Nothing at All
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To catch the shower, get away from bright city lights and find the darkest and clearest location you can, one with few hills or other obstacles on the horizon.
The moon will be new that night, so its light will not interfere with the display.
The Tau Herculids, the meteor shower from SW3, was predicted to come from the constellation Hercules — hence the shower’s name — a forecast that has since turned out to be incorrect.
The first bright star you see should be Arcturus.
Unlike meteor showers that are visible for days before and after a peak night, this show will not last long, if it occurs at all.

     Tau Herculids meteor shower may light up night sky over North America
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Earth is expected to pass through the debris trail of a broken comet on Monday night and early Tuesday morning.
Night sky watchers in North America have the best chance of seeing the tau Herculid shower, with NASA recommending around 1 a.m. on the East Coast or 10 p.m. on the West Coast as the best times to look up.
However, there's no guarantee of a dazzling display even if the sky is clear and dark, NASA stressed.
The comet, officially known as 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann, or SW3, was discovered in 1930 by German observers Arnold Schwassmann and Arno Arthur Wachman.
It wasn't spotted again until the late 1970s and in the 1990s the comet shattered into several pieces, NASA said.

     How to Watch the (Potential) Tau Herculids Meteor Shower Tonight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a periodic meteor shower, the Tau Herculids tend to be quite boring, but astronomers have reason to believe that this year’s version might be different.
The Tau Herculids meteor shower happens each year between May 19 and June 19, but virtually no one tends to notice.
Advertisement“If the fragments…were ejected with speeds greater than twice the normal speeds—fast enough to reach Earth—we might get a meteor shower,” according to a NASA press release.
And even then the storm may not rival what could happen tonight, as dust tends to dissipate over time.
People living in areas where the sky will be bright, such as in Australia, can watch the meteor shower online at the Virtual Telescope Project.

Previously, NASA astronomer Bill Cooke also called the potential meteor shower an "all or nothing event" in an agency blog post.
Don't worry if the tau Herculids don't end up happening as planned, however, as meteor showers happen fairly often.

     Meteor shower possible overnight: Where, when to watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AUSTIN (KXAN) — A meteor shower is possible overnight from Memorial Day into Tuesday.
What is it: The tau Herculids shower, which is forecast to peak overnight, was first discovered as a comet back in 1930, according to NASA.
If the debris from SW3 was traveling more than 220 miles per hour when it separated from the comet, we might see a nice meteor shower.
Where to watch: If this shower is visible, it’s likely you’ll be able to see it from Central Texas.
Tips: NASA says the best way to catch a meteor shower is to get as far away from light pollution as possible (sorry downtown Austin dwellers) and find the darkest patch of sky that you can.
