    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Rune and Carlos Alcaraz, it’s the first Grand Slam event with two teenage men in the quarterfinals since the 1994 French Open (Hendrik Dreekmann and Andrei Medvedev).
Rune is also the first Danish man to make a French Open quarterfinal and the first to do it at any major since Jan Leschly at the 1967 U.S. Open.
Tsitsipas, who blew a two-set lead over Novak Djokovic in last year’s French Open final, became the first men’s top eight seed to lose at this year’s Roland Garros.
The eighth-seeded Ruud is the first man from Norway to get to the round of eight at the French Open.
He had lost in the first round of the French Open in three consecutive appearances.

     Holger Rune dumps out Stefanos Tsitsipas as young guns shine at Roland Garros
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The so-called ‘next generation’ of men’s tennis is in danger of being usurped by an even newer breed at this year’s French Open after Stefanos Tsitsipas was sent packing by Danish teenager Holger Rune.
Greek fourth seed Tsitsipas, runner-up 12 months ago, is one of a handful of players still waiting to step in when the powers or physical health of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and, notionally, Roger Federer, finally begin to wane.
But the 23-year-old was outplayed by Rune, competing at Roland Garros for the first time, in a shock 7-5 3-6 6-3 6-4 defeat.
Rune joins fellow 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals, the first time two teenage men have reached that stage of a grand slam since the 1994 French Open.
It worked out and I’m really happy.”Stefanos Tsitsipas was last year’s runner-up (Jean-Francois Badias/AP)Rune will face Norwegian eighth seed Casper Ruud on Wednesday for a place in the semi-finals.
