     Summary: MINOT, N.D. – Your News Leader spoke with a member of Minot’s VFW about his thoughts on the meaning of Memorial Day.
“An honor to have come after the folks that have given their lives for this country, it’s an honor to carry that banner, it was an honor for the last 20 years to live in a legacy and heritage that came from those before,” said Bobby Meager.
Those we talked to want people to remember that Memorial Day is for those service members we have lost and Veterans Day is for those that are serving and have served in the past.

     Is It Ever OK to Say 'Happy Memorial Day'? Americans Split Over Sentiment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today (May 30, 2022), is Memorial Day, a day to honor all those who gave their lives in service to their country.
While it may seem natural to wish someone a "Happy Memorial Day," Americans remain split over whether it is an appropriate phrase to use to mark the national day of remembrance.
Is It Ever Appropriate To Say 'Happy Memorial Day'?
COSF CEO and Co-Founder Kristina Kaufmann told Newsweek that for some, the meaning of Memorial Day is deeply personal and not a day of celebration, and therefore it isn't appropriate to wish someone a "Happy Memorial Day."
She added, "One of the most hurtful things to hear or see when you've lost a parent is 'Happy Memorial Day.'
