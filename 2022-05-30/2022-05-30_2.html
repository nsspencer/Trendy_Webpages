     Summary: CLEVELAND — Across the state, Ohioans gathered on Memorial Day to honor the true meaning of the holiday: remembering those who gave their lives while serving their country in the U.S. military.
“The soldiers that have lost their lives and the sacrifices that were given are not to be lost.
They did it so that we can continue to live on,” said Maj. Christopher Zurawski with the United States Army Reserve.
More than 1,000 of those soldiers died in battle.
So as citizens, we are in a debt that we cannot repay,” said Greg Palumbo, executive director of Cuyahoga County Soldiers and Sailors Monument.

     Is It Ever OK to Say 'Happy Memorial Day'? Americans Split Over Sentiment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today (May 30, 2022), is Memorial Day, a day to honor all those who gave their lives in service to their country.
While it may seem natural to wish someone a "Happy Memorial Day," Americans remain split over whether it is an appropriate phrase to use to mark the national day of remembrance.
Is It Ever Appropriate To Say 'Happy Memorial Day'?
COSF CEO and Co-Founder Kristina Kaufmann told Newsweek that for some, the meaning of Memorial Day is deeply personal and not a day of celebration, and therefore it isn't appropriate to wish someone a "Happy Memorial Day."
She added, "One of the most hurtful things to hear or see when you've lost a parent is 'Happy Memorial Day.'

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (NEXSTAR) – While some may view Memorial Day as the unofficial start to summer – and the chance at a three-day weekend – the day carries a heavier meaning.
In the decades since its inception, the day became better known as Memorial Day, the Department of Veterans Affairs explains.
Memorial Day is often confused with Veterans Day, which falls on November 11 every year and honors those who fought in American wars and were discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.
After World War II, Armistice Day was renamed Veterans Day as part of the Uniform Holiday Bill.
Memorial Day should also not be confused with another military holiday in May, Armed Forces Day.
