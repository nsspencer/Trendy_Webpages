     Man in wig throws cake at glass protecting Mona Lisa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS (AP) — A man seemingly disguised as an old woman in a wheelchair threw a piece of cake at the glass protecting the Mona Lisa at the Louvre Museum and shouted at people to think of planet Earth.
The Paris prosecutor’s office said Monday that the 36-year-old man was detained following Sunday’s incident and sent to a police psychiatric unit.
Videos posted on social media showed a young man in a wig and lipstick who had arrived in a wheelchair.
The cake attack left a conspicuous white creamy smear on the glass but the famous work by Leonardo da Vinci wasn’t damaged.
That’s why I did this.”Guards were then filmed cleaning the cake from the glass.

Someone smashed a cake on Mona Lisa... pic.twitter.com/4NpztMCJEG — KL (@klevisl007) May 29, 2022“A man dressed as an old lady jumps out of a wheelchair and attempted to smash the bulletproof glass of the Mona Lisa.
Then proceeds to smear cake on the glass and throws roses everywhere, all before being tackled by security,” Lukeee wrote.
Speaking French, the man in the video says: “There are people who are destroying the Earth … All artists, think about the Earth.
The Mona Lisa has been behind glass since a Bolivian man threw a rock at the painting in December 1956, damaging her left elbow.

     Summary: ‘Think of the Earth, people are destroying the Earth,’ man dressed in a wig said as he was being led away from the Louvre Museum.
The Mona Lisa was attacked but unharmed when a visitor to the Louvre in Paris tried to smash the glass protecting the world’s most famous painting before smearing cake across its surface in an apparent environment-related publicity stunt.
The perpetrator, disguised as an old lady, then jumped out of the wheelchair before assaulting the bulletproof glass.
The cake attack left a conspicuous white creamy smear but the famous work by Leonardo da Vinci was not damaged.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The attack was defined as vandalism. However, since the painting is protected by bullet-proof glass, the creamy product never reached its target.
Louvre museum staff was quick to clean the area, as dozens of onlookers recorded the moment with their cell phones, separated from the painting by a black protective tape.
In one of the videos shared on Twitter, a black wheelchair can be seen abandoned in front of the oil painting, before a museum worker removed it.
The Louvre Museum, which precisely has the Mona Lisa in its Twitter image, has not issued any statement on the event.
The Mona Lisa has suffered other attacks over the years.

     Louvre mulls action after man dressed as woman smears Mona Lisa with cake
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris, May 30 (EFE).- Punters at the Paris Louvre museum were left stunned when a man disguised as a woman in a wheelchair smeared cake over the glass protecting Leonard Da Vinci’s iconic Mona Lisa painting over the weekend.
Sources from the Louvre told Efe that management at the French institution had not yet made a decision over whether they would be pursuing legal action in the aftermath of the attack.
According to initial information, the painting, which is protected by bulletproof glass, has not been damaged.
In 2009, a man hurled a ceramic cup at it, and when it was loaned to Japan in 1974, a woman tried to vandalize it with red spray.
The move to cover the canvas with a protective layer of glass was done to prevent it from being damaged in future attacks.
