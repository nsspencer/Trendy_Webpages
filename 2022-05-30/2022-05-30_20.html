     Hurricane Agatha 2022: Projected path track leads to Mexico’s southern coast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hurricane Agatha, the first of the eastern Pacific season, headed for a stretch of tourist beaches and fishing towns on Mexico’s southern coast Monday amid warnings of dangerous storm surge and flooding from heavy rains.
After forming on Sunday, Agatha quickly gained power, and it was predicted to make landfall as a strong Category 2 hurricane Monday afternoon or evening, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
The hurricane center said Agatha could “bring an extremely dangerous storm surge and life-threatening winds.”Early Monday, Agatha had maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 kph) — just 1 mph under the threshold for a Category 3, the hurricane center said.
Little change in strength was expected before the storm makes landfall, according to the hurricane center.
The government’s Mexican Turtle Center — a former slaughterhouse turned conservation center in Mazunte — announced it was closed to visitors until further notice because of the hurricane.
