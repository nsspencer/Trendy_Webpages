     Cardinals cornerback Jeff Gladney, former first-round pick, dead at 25
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeff Gladney, a former first-round draft pick of the Vikings who signed a two-year contract with the Cardinals in March, was killed in a car accident early Monday morning.
“We are asking prayers for the family and privacy at this most difficult time,” Overstreet said.
The Cardinals released this statement following news of Gladney's death.
Gladney, 25, was signed by Arizona with the intent of competing for a starting role at cornerback this upcoming season.
He was released by the Vikings in August 2021 after being indicted on domestic violence charges.
