In August 2009, a tourist threw a cup of tea at the Mona Lisa, smashing the display case.
In 1956, there were two more attacks: in the first, a man threw acid on the canvas, which damaged the bottom.
The Mona Lisa was not recovered until two years later when Perugia attempted to sell the work to the world-famous Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence, Italy.
