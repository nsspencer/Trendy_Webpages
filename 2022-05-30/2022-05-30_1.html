     Summary: PARIS, May 30 (Reuters) - The Mona Lisa was left shaken but unharmed on Sunday when a visitor to the Louvre tried to smash the glass protecting the world's most famous painting before smearing cream across its surface in an apparent climate-related publicity stunt.
The perpetrator was a man disguised as an old lady who jumped out of a wheelchair before attacking the glass.
"Maybe this is just nuts to me...," posted the author of a video of the incident's aftermath that shows a Louvre staffer cleaning the glass.

PARIS (AP) — A man seemingly disguised as an old woman in a wheelchair threw a piece of cake at the glass protecting the Mona Lisa at the Louvre Museum and shouted at people to think of planet Earth.
Videos posted on social media appear to show a young man in a wig and lipstick who had arrived in a wheelchair.
The man, whose identity was unknown, was also seen throwing roses in the museum gallery on Sunday.
The cake attack left a conspicuous white creamy smear on the glass but the famous work by Leonardo da Vinci wasn't damaged.

     Summary: Leonardo da Vinci's portrait of Lisa Gherardini, known as the Mona Lisa or La GiocondaParis (AFP) – The Mona Lisa was smeared with cake at the weekend by a man in a woman's wig who jumped out of a wheelchair and said artists should focus more on the planet.
"A man dressed as an old lady jumps out of a wheelchair and attempted to smash the bulletproof glass of the Mona Lisa.
Then proceeds to smear cake on the glass and throws roses everywhere, all before being tackled by security," Lukeee wrote.
Speaking French, the man says: "There are people who are destroying the Earth... All artists, think about the Earth.
The Mona Lisa has been behind glass since a Bolivian man threw a rock at the painting in December 1956, damaging her left elbow.

     'Mona Lisa' Gets Smeared With Cake By Man Disguised as Old Woman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Sunday afternoon in Paris, a man dressed as an elderly woman was seen attempting to vandalize the Louvre Museum’s most famous painting, the Mona Lisa.
According to witness reports, a young man dressed as an elderly woman jumped out of his wheelchair and smashed a cake on the bulletproof glass protecting Leonardo da Vinci‘s infamous painting.
The protective glass was later cleaned by museum workers without any damage to the original artwork.
A man once damaged the painting with sulfuric acid back in the 1950s and a Bolivian student hit the Mona Lisa canvas with a stone in 1956.
VIDEO: The protective glass of the Mona Lisa painting at The Louvre was caked today by a man dressed up as an elderly woman in a wheelchair.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The attack was defined as vandalism. However, since the painting is protected by bullet-proof glass, the creamy product never reached its target.
Louvre museum staff was quick to clean the area, as dozens of onlookers recorded the moment with their cell phones, separated from the painting by a black protective tape.
In one of the videos shared on Twitter, a black wheelchair can be seen abandoned in front of the oil painting, before a museum worker removed it.
The Louvre Museum, which precisely has the Mona Lisa in its Twitter image, has not issued any statement on the event.
The Mona Lisa has suffered other attacks over the years.

     Louvre mulls action after man dressed as woman smears Mona Lisa with cake
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris, May 30 (EFE).- Punters at the Paris Louvre museum were left stunned when a man disguised as a woman in a wheelchair smeared cake over the glass protecting Leonard Da Vinci’s iconic Mona Lisa painting over the weekend.
Sources from the Louvre told Efe that management at the French institution had not yet made a decision over whether they would be pursuing legal action in the aftermath of the attack.
According to initial information, the painting, which is protected by bulletproof glass, has not been damaged.
In 2009, a man hurled a ceramic cup at it, and when it was loaned to Japan in 1974, a woman tried to vandalize it with red spray.
The move to cover the canvas with a protective layer of glass was done to prevent it from being damaged in future attacks.
