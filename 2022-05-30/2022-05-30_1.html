     Summary: Former Minnesota Vikings cornerback Jeff Gladney has died at age 25.
Shortly after the news, Jalen Reagor, who was teammates with Gladney at TCU from 2017-19, posted on his Twitter account calling Gladney "my brother, my best friend" and "my right-hand man."
Justin Jefferson, who was teammates with Gladney in Minnesota during the 2020 season, also took to social media to pay his respects.
Gladney was selected by the Vikings with the 31st overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.
Gladney was found not guilty on both counts last March and signed a one-year deal with the Arizona Cardinals this offseason.
