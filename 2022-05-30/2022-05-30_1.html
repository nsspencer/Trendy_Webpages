     Mona Lisa left unharmed but smeared in cream in climate protest stunt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS (Reuters) – The Mona Lisa was left shaken but unharmed on Sunday when a visitor to the Louvre tried to smash the glass protecting the world’s most famous painting before smearing cream across its surface in an apparent climate-related publicity stunt.
The perpetrator was a man disguised as an old lady who jumped out of a wheelchair before attacking the glass.
“Maybe this is just nuts to me…,” posted the author of a video of the incident’s aftermath that shows a Louvre staffer cleaning the glass.
“(He) then proceeds to smear cake on the glass, and throws roses everywhere before being tackled by security.”The Louvre was not immediately available for comment.
Another video posted on social media showed the same staffer finishing cleaning the pane while another attendant removes a wheelchair from in front of the Da Vinci masterpiece.

     'Mona Lisa' Gets Smeared With Cake By Man Disguised as Old Woman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Sunday afternoon in Paris, a man dressed as an elderly woman was seen attempting to vandalize the Louvre Museum’s most famous painting, the Mona Lisa.
According to witness reports, a young man dressed as an elderly woman jumped out of his wheelchair and smashed a cake on the bulletproof glass protecting Leonardo da Vinci‘s infamous painting.
The protective glass was later cleaned by museum workers without any damage to the original artwork.
A man once damaged the painting with sulfuric acid back in the 1950s and a Bolivian student hit the Mona Lisa canvas with a stone in 1956.

     Summary: The iconic Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci, hung at the Louvre in Paris, came under attack recently as a man disguised as an old woman in a wheelchair threw a cake at the portrait.
Much to everyone’s astonishment, he suddenly stood up and attempted to smash the bulletproof glass of the Mona Lisa, and then smeared cake on the glass itself.
Maybe this is just nuts to me💀but an man dressed as an old lady jumps out of a wheel chair and attempted to smash the bullet proof glass of the Mona Lisa.
Then proceeds to smear cake on the glass, and throws roses everywhere all before being tackled by security.

     Pie thrown at Mona Lisa by fake old woman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The attack was defined as vandalism. However, since the painting is protected by bullet-proof glass, the creamy product never reached its target.
Louvre museum staff was quick to clean the area, as dozens of onlookers recorded the moment with their cell phones, separated from the painting by a black protective tape.
In one of the videos shared on Twitter, a black wheelchair can be seen abandoned in front of the oil painting, before a museum worker removed it.
The Louvre Museum, which precisely has the Mona Lisa in its Twitter image, has not issued any statement on the event.
The Mona Lisa has suffered other attacks over the years.
