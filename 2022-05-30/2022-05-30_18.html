     Colombia: Presidential elections head toward second-round run off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Colombian Presidential Election will progress to a second-round runoff on June 19th, as no candidate has won fifty percent of the vote, for an outright victory.
By James BlearsWith most of the votes counted, left-wing candidate Gustavo Petro has won round one of Sunday`s Colombian Presidential Election.
Petro won just over forty percent of the vote, while Hernandez, a former mayor of Bucaramanga has got 28.1 percent.
In 2018, Petro lost the second-round runoff to now outgoing President Ivan Duque.
On June 19th Colombian voters will decide who of these two, will lead and run the country for the next four years.

     Leftist candidate to run-off against millionaire who praised Hitler in Colombian presidential elections
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LEFTIST candidate Gustavo Petro has won the first round of the Colombian elections.
He will face a run-off against a millionaire businessman who has previously praised Adolf Hitler.
Mr Hernandez is a far-right populist whose campaign, largely run on social media, tried to strike an anti-establishment tone.
Mr Petro is a former M-19 guerilla fighter, but has since shifted from revolutionary politics to a more moderate stance.
His preferred candidate, Federico Gutierrez, finished in third place on 24 per cent of the vote and immediately called for his supporters to back Mr Hernandez.

     Colombia Elections: The End of Uribismo?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This result in itself represents a profound change in Colombia, where Uribismo has remained iron-clad for more than 20 years.
Indeed, Uribismo is better positioned to achieve this goal by supporting the outsider than with its own candidate in the race.
Uribismo has been propped up by a system of dominant alliances that cater to the United States and sustained by the perpetuation of internal armed conflict that legitimizes a brutal repressive order.
Since the 2016 peace accords with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Uribismo has ebbed.
With Uribismo deflated, Petro entered the fray with a moderate proposal linked to the social movements that confronted Uribismo during and in the aftermath of the armed conflict.

     REACTION: Petro and Hernández Lead Colombia’s Presidential Race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The runner-up, Rodolfo Hernández (Independent) who had surged in polls in the last few weeks, amassed 28% of the preference.
Hernández won all but 4 of the 123 municipalities of Boyacá department and all but 10 of 116 municipalities in Cundinamarca.
Both Gustavo Petro and Rodolfo Hernández embody anti-establishment options.
Petro won in Bogotá, the Caribbean Coast and the southwest with an advantage that would have allowed him to win the presidency at once.
Almost the same thing happened with Rodolfo Hernández who won in a large part of the Andean region.

     Colombia: Gustavo Petro wins first round of the presidential election
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just as all of the polls predicted over the last three months, Gustavo Petro led the first round of voting for the Colombian presidential election with an astonishing 8.5 million votes (40 percent).
For a start, Hernández is the only candidate who ties with Petro in the opinion polls for the second round.
But the findings of one poll that Hernández would tie with Petro in a second round, gave momentum to his campaign.
A section of the ruling class decided that the only way to beat Petro in the second round was to back Hernández, rather than Fico.
A close second roundIt looks like the second round will be a genuine challenge for Pacto Histórico, but the outcome is not decided in advance.

The result is really going to define whether or not Colombia is really going to move forward with the peace accord.

One, the peace accord, which was a real milestone.
