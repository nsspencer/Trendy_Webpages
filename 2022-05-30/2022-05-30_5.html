     Summary: MINOT, N.D. – Your News Leader spoke with a member of Minot’s VFW about his thoughts on the meaning of Memorial Day.
“An honor to have come after the folks that have given their lives for this country, it’s an honor to carry that banner, it was an honor for the last 20 years to live in a legacy and heritage that came from those before,” said Bobby Meager.
Those we talked to want people to remember that Memorial Day is for those service members we have lost and Veterans Day is for those that are serving and have served in the past.

     Summary: CLEVELAND — Across the state, Ohioans gathered on Memorial Day to honor the true meaning of the holiday: remembering those who gave their lives while serving their country in the U.S. military.
“The soldiers that have lost their lives and the sacrifices that were given are not to be lost.
They did it so that we can continue to live on,” said Maj. Christopher Zurawski with the United States Army Reserve.
More than 1,000 of those soldiers died in battle.
So as citizens, we are in a debt that we cannot repay,” said Greg Palumbo, executive director of Cuyahoga County Soldiers and Sailors Monument.

     Is It Ever OK to Say 'Happy Memorial Day'? Americans Split Over Sentiment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today (May 30, 2022), is Memorial Day, a day to honor all those who gave their lives in service to their country.
While it may seem natural to wish someone a "Happy Memorial Day," Americans remain split over whether it is an appropriate phrase to use to mark the national day of remembrance.
Is It Ever Appropriate To Say 'Happy Memorial Day'?
