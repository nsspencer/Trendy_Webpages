     Swiatek survives scare against injured Zheng at French Open
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris (AFP) – World number one Iga Swiatek survived a scare at the hands of injured Chinese teenager Zheng Qinwen on Monday, dropping the first set in their French Open last-16 clash before going on to make the quarter-finals with a 32nd successive win.
Advertising Read moreSwiatek prevailed 6-7 (5/7), 6-0, 6-2 to equal the third best winning streak this century set by Justine Henin 14 years ago.
As the 2020 Roland Garros champion's streak looked in peril, Zheng required a medical timeout at 0-3 in the second set for a leg injury.
Zheng, who had defeated 2018 champion Simona Halep on her way to the fourth round, returned with her right thigh heavily strapped and quickly dropped the second set.
Swiatek carved out a double break in the decider and will face US 11th seed Jessica Pegula for a place in the semi-finals.

     Tennis-Swiatek extinguishes Zheng’s fire to reach French Open last eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Julien PretotPARIS (Reuters) – Iga Swiatek survived a big scare as she advanced to the French Open quarter-finals by beating Chinese teenager Qinwen Zheng 6-7(5) 6-0 6-2 for her 32nd consecutive victory on Monday.
Poland’s Swiatek, who will next face American 11th seed Jessica Pegula, is unbeaten since last February, claiming titles on clay in Stuttgart and Rome.
The 20-year-old is on the longest unbeaten run in the women’s tour since Serena bagged 34 victories in succession in 2013.
“She’s playing amazing tennis,” Swiatek said of Zheng.
She picked herself up to fight back in the third but the Swiatek express train was already going full speed and the Pole wrapped it up when Zheng’s backhand sailed long.
