     Celtics' Jaylen Brown: Records 24 points
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brown registered 24 points (8-15 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 7-8 FT), six rebounds and six assists in 44 minutes during Sunday's 100-96 win over the Heat in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals.
Brown stuffed the stat sheet and was one of the best players for Boston in a win that punched the team a ticket to the NBA Finals.
The former California standout scored 20 or more points in all but one of seven games in the series against the Heat and should play a key role in the Finals against the Warriors.

     Jaylen Brown contract incentive would push Celtics into luxury tax with NBA Finals win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, Boston left open the door they could become a luxury tax team for this year via one happy scenario for the franchise: They win an NBA Championship.
There were a number of individual contract incentives in the deal (games played, NBA awards) as well as incentives triggered by team success (regular season wins, playoff rounds won).
According to ESPN’s Bobby Marks, Brown’s biggest remaining incentive is worth $964,286 for winning the NBA Finals.
The Celtics currently stand just $358,000 below the luxury tax line, which provided Boston with enough of a cushion to avoid the tax barring anything short of a NBA Finals win with Brown’s team contract incentives.
Brown’s deal isn’t the only one on the Celtics with plenty of contract implications involved based on how Boston performs in the NBA Finals.

     Jaylen Brown calls out Celtics fans for stoking fire of trade rumors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s hard to imagine at this point that earlier in the season, some fans were calling for the head of Jaylen Brown.
Now that the Boston Celtics are in the Finals, however, most folks could not be more proud of what this young man has done to help his team reach this level of success this season.
The 25-year-old has been around long enough to understand how passionate Boston fans truly are and how they’re not the type to go easy even on their own players.
Right now, there’s no denying that Brown is one of the most important players on the roster.
It would also be safe to say that the Celtics probably wouldn’t even be contending for a title if he were not around.

     Jaylen Brown Calls Out Celtics Fans For Promoting Trade Rumors: "The Talk Was Loud..."
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY SportsAs the Celtics walked off the court with a win on Sunday, star guard Jaylen Brown found himself reflecting on the season.
“That trade talk was loud, and most of it came from Boston fans,” Brown told Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports.
While the Celtics appear committed to building around Brown and Tatum, speculation about Brown’s availability has notably increased around the league.
It's a good thing the Celtics never traded Brown.
He was huge all season long for the Celtics and his two-way game is part of the reason why they're scheduled to play in the NBA Finals.
