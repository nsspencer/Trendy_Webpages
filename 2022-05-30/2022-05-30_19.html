     The Bob’s Burgers Movie review – delightfully weird and comfortable in it’s own skin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I have never seen an episode of the long-running Fox animated series Bob’s Burgers.
Loren Bouchard’s ode to anyone unafraid to let their freak flag fly, no matter how cumbersome, is a breath of awkward fresh air.
The Bobs Burgers Movie is so delightfully weird, off-kilter, and steadfast in its quirk that it keeps a smile on your face for much of the bewildering ride.
Bob’s Burgers gets The Simpsons treatment with its movie that centers around the floundering burger joint with another pothole in the road.
He was arrested for murder when the children stumbled upon a dead body hidden at the bottom of the hole.

     ‘The Bob’s Burgers Movie’ Is Disney’s Most Successful 2D Release Since ‘The Princess And The Frog’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disney’s The Bob’s Burger’s Movie opened at #3, earning a modest $15 million (estimated) over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, with $12.6m of that amount posted over the standard weekend period.
While the Fox tv series spinoff proved no match for Top Gun: Maverick, which is headed to a $150m+ opening, it did best the Walt Disney Company’s last theatrical 2d animation effort, 2011’s Winnie the Pooh, which opened with $7.9m.
The last time Disney put out a better-performing 2d feature was The Princess and the Frog, which launched wide with a $24.2m weeekend back in 2009.
The Bob’s Burgers opening is also a far cry from The Simpsons Movie, another Fox 2d series spinoff that launched with $74m a decade-and-a-half ago, but as Deadline points out, Bob’s Burgers is a niche franchise with a weekly series average of roughly 1.3 million viewers.
Around 1.1 million people paid to see the film in theaters over the Fri-Sun period, which is a fair number considering the show’s limited appeal.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bob’s Burgers Movie is a lot of things.
Since its release in 2011, we have seen Bob’s Burgers have the same opening sequence.
Before an episode of the animated series begins, the Belcher family stand outside their restaurant for its grand opening.
In response, Bouchard heavily hinted that the change was coming, as continuity in the world of Bob’s Burgers is something the team always considers.
The Bob’s Burgers Movie is out in cinemas now.

     The Bob’s Burgers Movie Review: A Familiar, Evenly Cooked Burger
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And as is the case with some animated shows, its success has finally culminated in a full-length movie simply titled The Bob’s Burgers Movie.
Directed by series creator Loren Bouchard and longtime series director Bernard Derriman, The Bob’s Burgers Movie sees the Belcher family’s wild kickoff to their summer.
Between a sinkhole blocking the entrance to Bob’s Burgers and the family unable to repay loans, the Belcher family is in a tough spot.
The tone remains aligned with the Bob’s Burgers TV show; silly, lighthearted, and occasionally a little gross, but with nice messages of family love.
The Bob’s Burgers Movie is nothing revolutionary, but it’s still fun, big-screen translation of a celebrated animated series that should please fans of the series and newcomers alike.

     Bob’s Burgers Fails To Learn From The Simpsons Movie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: THEGAMER VIDEO OF THE DAYAt its simplest, The Simpsons Movie feels like a movie, while The Bob’s Burgers Movie feels like a long episode of Bob’s Burgers.
The Bob’s Burgers Movie is ultimately a comedy, and it made me laugh out loud a dozen or so times.
This comparison doesn’t really exist with The Simpsons Movie because it’s not an episode of The Simpsons, it’s just the best Simpsons movie we have.
The Bob’s Burgers Movie is a great time if you’re a Bob’s Burgers fan, but it doesn’t feel any different from watching three or four great Bob’s Burgers episodes in a row.
I’m glad it’s here, and I know fans will enjoy it, but it feels like a shame that even with The Bob’s Burgers Movie in theatres, we don’t actually have a Bob’s Burgers movie to enjoy.

     The Bob’s Burgers Movie REVIEW – Comfort Food
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The premise of The Bob’s Burgers Movie feels like a natural escalation of the usual misadventures of downbeat burger-slinger Bob Belcher (H. Jon Benjamin), his perpetual optimist wife Linda (John Roberts) and their family.
The plot does bear resemblance to a few previous episodes, and consequently it feels at times like The Bob’s Burgers Movie’s trying to rehash some of its greatest hits.
That’s not to say Bob’s Burgers has lost its charm – this movie is as gut-bustingly funny as the show has ever been.
The Bob’s Burgers Movie may not push the envelope or push its characters into a brand new world, but it does deliver an exciting adventure that rockets through its runtime with no drag.
It’s sincere without being saccharine, heartfelt without being hokey, and a sure crowd-pleaser for fans and Bob’s Burgers newbies alike.
