     Johnny Depp, awaiting verdict, turns up on stage with Jeff Beck in England
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Depp appeared with English guitarist Jeff Beck to perform a series of music covers, including John Lennon’s “Isolation”, a track they collaborated on and released in 2020.
Jurors in Virginia deliberating the defamation claims from both “Pirates of the Caribbean” star Depp and Heard adjourned on Friday without returning a verdict.
Heard, 36, countersued for $100 million, saying Depp smeared her reputation when his lawyer called her accusations a “hoax”.
Depp fans took to Instagram and Twitter to share their views of the American actor’s performance on stage.
“Johnny is an absolute mad man … leaves court Friday .. playing a gig in Sheffield UK Sunday.. with Jeff Beck..mind blown,” Twitter user @OneloveEarth said.
