     Tennis-Swiatek extinguishes Zheng’s fire to reach French Open last eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Julien PretotPARIS (Reuters) – Iga Swiatek survived a big scare as she advanced to the French Open quarter-finals by beating Chinese teenager Qinwen Zheng 6-7(5) 6-0 6-2 for her 32nd consecutive victory on Monday.
Poland’s Swiatek, who will next face American 11th seed Jessica Pegula, is unbeaten since last February, claiming titles on clay in Stuttgart and Rome.
The 20-year-old is on the longest unbeaten run in the women’s tour since Serena bagged 34 victories in succession in 2013.
“She’s playing amazing tennis,” Swiatek said of Zheng.
She picked herself up to fight back in the third but the Swiatek express train was already going full speed and the Pole wrapped it up when Zheng’s backhand sailed long.
