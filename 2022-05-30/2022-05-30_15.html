     Stranger Things: Predictions For Season 4 Volume 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 of Stranger ThingsThe first seven episodes of season 4 of Stranger Things are packed with favorite characters, a few newcomers, and learning the history of the villain Vecna.
After binge-watching volume 1, it's hard not to make predictions for volume 2, as there are some things that fans would absolutely love to see.
RELATED: Stranger Things: The Show Still Can’t Decide What To Do With WillSometimes episode titles can hint at the action, and episode 8 of Stranger Things season 4 is called "Papa," with the season finale (episode 9) being called "The Piggyback."
With so many big things happening in volume 1 of Stranger Things season 4, it definitely seems like the last two episodes will deliver massive surprises and powerful moments.
The Stranger Things season 4 finale is long and since the episode is more than two hours, that gives the show a lot of room to set up season 5.
