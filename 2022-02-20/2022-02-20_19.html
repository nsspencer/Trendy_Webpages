     Kevin Durant won't attend 2022 NBA All-Star Game after death of grandmother
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant was named a captain for the 2022 NBA All-Star Game by virtue of receiving the most fan votes of any player in the Eastern Conference.
He was not scheduled to play in the game due to a knee injury, but now Durant will no longer be in attendance at all.
On Sunday, Durant's mother, Wanda, announced on Instagram that Barbara Davis, her mother and Kevin Durant's grandmother, died on Sunday.
"It is with great sadness that we share with family and friends that our Dear Sweet Mama, BARBARA A. Davis, transitioned early this morning," Wanda Durant wrote.
It's no surprise that he would skip the All-Star Game in order to be with his mother and family during this difficult time.
