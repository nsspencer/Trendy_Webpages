     Giannis Antetokounmpo Knows You Miss 100% of the Fits You Don’t Try
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Last year, a clip of Giannis Antetokounmpo talking to his former Milwaukee Bucks teammate PJ Tucker went viral.
The two-time MVP told Tucker about how he isn’t afraid to make mistakes, to air ball shots, or miss back-to-back free throws.
The same mindset can apply to style, I suggested to Antetokounmpo over the phone this week: The best-dressed people in the world are fearless, not worried about wearing the wrong thing the wrong way.
“The way I dress is I try to live in the moment as much as possible,” he said.
Both Antetokounmpo, with friends and family around the world, and Okuboyejo, who needs to reach his network of artisans abroad, attest to relying on WhatsApp.

     Looking at Giannis Antetokounmpo’s MVP case this seasonWhen it comes to the basic numbers, Giannis is right up there with the best of them (as always).
What is also incredible about the numbers Giannis is able to put up is how few minutes he plays.
As far as advanced numbers, Giannis has been fantastic there as well.
He is 2nd in Win Shares, Box Plus-Minus, Value Over Replacement Player, Player Efficiency Rating, and Total Points Added.
The two players who are clearly battling Giannis for MVP right now are Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic (honorable mention to DeMar DeRozan, but he is clearly fourth right now).
