     [PHOTOS] ‘1883’: Reasons to Like the ‘Yellowstone’ Spinoff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     I know pretty much everyone who watches even one episode of the western primetime soap Yellowstone instantly loves it.
But that (really, really large) number doesn’t include me.
I’ve got nothing against Taylor Sheridan’s juggernaut Paramount Network series, which stars Kevin Costner as the patriarch of a Montana ranching family.
But then came 1883, Yellowstone‘s post-Civil War prequel, a series whose premiere I watched on a whim on a slow day.
So in the effort of pulling some Yellowstone averse folks (c’mon, there’s gotta be more of you out there) into the 1883 fold, I’ve pulled together a bunch of reasons that you might actually love the Paramount+ prequel.

     Will 1883 Actually Kill Off One Of Its Main Characters In The Season 1 Finale?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Spoilers below for the penultimate episode of 1883 Season 1, so be warned if you haven’t yet watched!
When 1883 debuted to streaming audiences, basically the first thing viewers witnessed was Isabel May’s travel-worn Elsa Dutton being shot through the stomach with an arrow.
But instead of just informing viewers about what happened and then clearing things up in purely optimistic ways, 1883 made it appear as if the season finale will actually take one of its main characters out of the picture for good.
Is Elsa Going To Die Now?
How weird would it be to have someone else narrating in Season 2?
