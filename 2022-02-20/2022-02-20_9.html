     Lexi, You In Danger Girl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Of all the characters on Euphoria, Lexi Howard (Maude Apatow) is usually the one you can rely on for a reprieve from the drama.
In a flashback, Lexi explains to Fezco (Angus Cloud) that her play is centered around friendship, and that she wrote it with the best intentions.
While Lexi recounts for the audience how Maddy once moved in with them, Cassie goes to the bathroom to sob.
It‚Äôs a huge hit with the audience: People give a standing ovation, Jules and Rue laugh, and Maddy yells, ‚ÄúLexi, you‚Äôre a f*cking G!‚Äù But Nate and Cassie are furious.
Lexi, you in danger girl.

     4 Summary ‚ÄúThe Theatre and It‚Äôs Double‚Äù blends art and reality as Lexi‚Äôs play proves to be a hit ‚Äî a little too close to home.
This recap of Euphoria season 2, episode 7, ‚ÄúThe Theatre and It‚Äôs Double‚Äù, contains spoilers.
‚ÄúThe Theatre and It‚Äôs Double‚Äù, the penultimate episode of the season, takes this to something of an extreme.
Fez‚Äôs house, totally removed from the stage and audience, is a reminder that, for all its similarities to real life, Lexi‚Äôs play is fiction, a performance.
You can stream Euphoria season 2, episode 7, ‚ÄúThe Theatre and It‚Äôs Double‚Äù exclusively on HBO.

Yet, Lexi's play still manages to capture the thrill of putting on a production at that age, and Euphoria's soundtrack only adds to this.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As far as anyone can tell, there isn't much that actually happens over the course of Lexi Howard's semi-autobiographical play, which consumes the bulk of Euphoria season 2's penultimate episode.
Case in point: Lexi's play seems to wrap Act 1 with Ethan, as the Nate Jacobs-inspired ‚ÄúJake,‚Äù gyrating against a set of dumbbells with an accompanying chorus of shirtless jocks.
By the end of episode 7, we aren't sure if he makes it to the play in one piece.

     'Euphoria' Season 2, Episode 7 Recap: What Happened in Lexi's Play?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Let‚Äôs quickly set the stage for Euphoria episode 7, the first of what appears to be a two-part season finale framed through Lexi‚Äôs school play.
All those parties are in the audience for Lexi‚Äôs play, which chronicles her own strained relationships with Rue, Cassie, her mother, and Maddy since freshman year.
At this moment, we‚Äôre made aware of the school audience, themselves now made aware that they are watching a play about them.
Lexi then introduces the cast, which includes stand-ins for Lexi, Cassie, Maddy, Kat, and Rue.
At the play, Cassie leaves and goes to the bathroom crying.
