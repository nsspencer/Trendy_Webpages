    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There were multiple moments worth noting from the festivities of NBA 75 during All-Star Weekend that featured Jordan.
Jordan also looked to sneak up on the Dallas Mavericks superstar point guard Luka Doncic for a hug that he wasn’t expecting.
At first, Luka looked like he was caught off-guard when Jordan went for the hug.
Luka Doncic on his interaction with Michael Jordan: “MJ knows my name.
Meanwhile, Jordan obviously had one of the most decorated careers in modern sports history with six NBA Championships, five MVPs, six Finals MVPs, and 14 All-Star selections.

     LeBron James ‘humbled’ by Michael Jordan hug at emotional NBA 75 celebration
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LeBron James was 11 years old when the NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland honored basketball’s 50 greatest players.
25 years later, 19 of them spent playing in the NBA, James was still starstruck upon meeting his childhood hero, Michael Jordan.
On Sunday, the 37-year-old was among the 76 current and former NBA players named to the league’s all-time best with Jordan.
“It meant something to me.”Michael Jordan and LeBron James embraced at the NBA All-Star Game.
I couldn’t picture that moment any better.”James said his interaction with Michael Jordan was more meaningful following his game-clinching shot during the All-Star Game.

     At halftime of the All-Star Game at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse on Sunday, the NBA honored the 75 greatest players in the history of the league in conjunction with their 75th anniversary.
While the names of those on the roster had been announced, it wasn’t known how many were going to show up.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     He made a splashy appearance at the NBA All-Star game this Sunday, greeting both current superstars and past legends alike.
As part of Sunday's ceremony, the NBA recognized the team during halftime of the All-Star game.
We can go play 1-on-1, me and you, right now," Jordan told Magic when he first met him at the All-Star game.
ET, about an hour and a half before the All-Star Game was set to tip off.
Attending the All-Star Game would have required Jordan to sprint from Daytona International Speedway to an airport, take a private jet, and head straight to the arena before halftime ended.

     At the beginning of the day, it wasn't entirely clear if Michael Jordan, a player the NBA definitely would have wanted to have for its All-Star Game halftime festivities, would be in attendance.
ET, about an hour and a half before the All-Star Game was set to tip off.
Which, to be fair, is probably something fans would have wanted to see over the rest of the All-Star Game.
