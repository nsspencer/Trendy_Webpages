     Michael Jordan, LeBron James embrace at NBA All-Star Game (video)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 2022 NBA All-Star Game was the most special in recent memory.
The league celebrated its 75th anniversary and the best 75 players to ever grace an NBA floor.
Ever since he was 18 years old, LeBron James has found himself—sometimes unfairly—compared to Michael Jordan.
In a refreshing scene from the sometimes contentious debate, Jordan and James didn't appear to have a serious conversation.
Jordan, who was James's idol growing up, simply asked him, “Hanging in there?”The two shared a hug and although their whole conversation couldn't be heard, Jordan did leave James with one message.

First, it didn't look like Jordan was going to make it to the halftime ceremony honoring the NBA's 75th anniversary all-time team.
As a new owner of the 23XI Racing team, he was at the Daytona 500 watching his driver, Bubba Wallace.

     LeBron James 'humbled and appreciative' for chance to see Michael Jordan during NBA 75 celebration
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CLEVELAND — LeBron James relished the 2022 NBA All-Star Game perhaps more than any other among his 18 career appearances.
And James made the winning shot, a fadeaway jumper he said was inspired by Michael Jordan.
Speaking of Jordan, James made time to greet Jordan at halftime when the league’s 76 greatest players were recognized for the NBA’s 75th anniversary season.
Twenty-five years ago, when the All-Star Game in Cleveland honored the game’s greatest 50 players, James was just 11 years old, his amazing basketball future just a dream.
Super, super, super dope, and I was very humbled and appreciative of that," James said.

Which, to be fair, is probably something fans would have wanted to see over the rest of the All-Star Game.
