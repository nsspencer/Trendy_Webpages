     Michael Jordan Hugs Vanessa Bryant As Kobe's Honored At NBA 75 Ceremony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Michael Jordan shared a special moment with Kobe Bryant's wife at the All-Star Game on Sunday ... with MJ embracing Vanessa after the Lakers legend was honored during halftime.
Jordan, Jerry West and Lakers GM/Kobe's longtime agent Rob Pelinka were spotted alongside Vanessa during the festivities ... as #23 went up and gave her a big hug and chatted with her on the court.
Kobe's presence was felt throughout the night ... as Vanessa was in attendance to hand Chris Paul the WNBA's first Kobe and Gigi Bryant Advocacy award, which honors players for their contributions to women's hoops.
Stephen Curry won the newly-designed Kobe Bryant All-Star MVP award ... after nailing 16 3-pointers to help Team LeBron beat Team Durant, 163-160.
The exchange between MJ and Vanessa was truly emotional for fans to watch -- Jordan and Kobe were close, and the Bulls legend even gave a tearful speech at Bryant's service in 2020.

     Vanessa Bryant's Charitable Night at NBA All-Star Game Overshadowed by Sexist Twitter Comments About Her Appearance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s been just over two years since Vanessa Bryant lost husband Kobe and 13-year-old daughter Gigi in a devastating helicopter crash.
So, when she presented the inaugural Kobe &amp; Gigi Bryant WNBA Advocacy Award on Sunday night at the NBA All-Star game, that should have been the only story.
Unfortunately, Twitter decided to take the moment to comment about her appearance instead of praising her giving heart.
And yes, most of the comments (but not all) came from men, which just added another layer to the sexism.
But it’s Kelli Fields, who summed it up best, “People sitting on Twitter talking about Vanessa Bryant‘s weight… Whether she’s pregnant, large or wearing a big coat is no one’s business.
