His head coach Monty Williams (who is also the All-Star game coach) was also asked if Paul will play in the game (see tweet below from Rankin).

     Chris Paul, 12-time All-Star for the Phoenix Suns, was the inaugural recipient of the Kobe &amp; Gigi Bryant WNBA Advocacy Award for his “significant contributions to the advancement of girls’ and women’s basketball, and advocacy for the WNBA.” The WNBA and Vanessa Bryant presented Paul the award at Sunday’s NBA All-Star at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland.
WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert in a news release: “I have seen first-hand Chris’ appreciation of the WNBA and the game at every level for women and girls, especially in Phoenix and North Carolina, and his ardent support of our game strongly reflects the legacy of Kobe and Gigi.
The league is proud to name Chris as the inaugural recipient of the Kobe &amp; Gigi Bryant WNBA Advocacy Award, as he serves as a leader and role model for other professional athletes around growing the future of the game for young girls and all fans.”Said Paul: “I’m excited about seeing the growth in the women’s game.
I’m a big fan of the W. It’s probably been the funniest year, and last year having the WNBA team right there in our home city.
We don’t really get to do that in the league.”Editorial credit: Kathy Hutchins / Shutterstock.com

     Report: Chris Paul to miss at least 6-8 weeks with avulsion fracture in right thumb
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Phoenix Suns will have to finish most if not all of the regular season without half of its All-Star backcourt.
Just moments before the 2022 All-Star Game on Sunday, Allie LaForce of TNT reported that Chris Paul had been diagnosed with an avulsion fracture in his right thumb.
He had reportedly undergone an MRI, but the results were unknown even as he participated in All-Star Weekend events, often with a visible wrap on his injured right hand.
It’s like my hand surgeon is part of my family, but things could be a lot worse,” Paul said during Saturday’s All-Star press conference.
The Suns are coming off just their third Western Conference championship season in franchise history and are seeking to win the team’s first ever NBA championship in its 54 seasons of existence.

     On Sunday before the NBA All-Star game, TNT's Allie LaForce reported that Chris Paul would be out six to eight weeks with a right thumb avulsion fracture.
During this season, the 12-time All-Star averages 15 points per game and leads the league with 10.7 assists per game.
So far this season, Paul hadn't missed a game with his streak of 68 consecutive games dating back to last postseason.
This season, Paul's net rating is +10.5, which is good for third among players averaging 30 minutes per game.
If you rostered Paul or just want to capitalize on this situation, Cameron Payne should be added immediately.

The Suns are the deepest team in the West and remain the best bet to return to the NBA Finals.
