     Macy Gray's NBA All-Star National Anthem Gets Grin from LeBron James
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Macy Gray’s the latest to try something different with the National Anthem during the NBA All-Star weekend ... and yet again, it evoked some would-be chuckles from the players.
He was standing next to Steph Curry, who kept his composure this time ... and you can see LBJ with a big grin on his face as Macy sings.
When he looks up to the Jumbotron and sees his reaction was captured, he bows his head in embarrassment -- trying to hide.
When Bill Murray is terrified by Macy Gray’s rendition of the Star Spangled Banner.
Funny enough, she’s actually had some thoughts on Old Glory of late ... suggesting the flag needs to be redesigned to reflect modern-day America.

APIt’s not the first time the All-Star Game has provided amusement for James, who is playing in his 18th edition of the game and captaining one of the squads.
As James and Kevin Durant drafted their respective teams for the game, James couldn’t hold back his laughter, and covered his face, as Durant explained his reasoning for selecting Rudy Gobert over James Harden when the two were the only remaining players yet to be chosen.
