     Euphoria season 2, episode 7 recap – “The Theatre and It’s Double”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     4 Summary “The Theatre and It’s Double” blends art and reality as Lexi’s play proves to be a hit — a little too close to home.
This recap of Euphoria season 2, episode 7, “The Theatre and It’s Double”, contains spoilers.
“The Theatre and It’s Double”, the penultimate episode of the season, takes this to something of an extreme.
Fez’s house, totally removed from the stage and audience, is a reminder that, for all its similarities to real life, Lexi’s play is fiction, a performance.
You can stream Euphoria season 2, episode 7, “The Theatre and It’s Double” exclusively on HBO.

     Euphoria season 2 episode 7: Lexi’s play, Our Life, reviewed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Still, we’ve had Lexi’s play to look forward to, a project she’s been obsessing over ever since she decided her high school production of Oklahoma!
Today, Our Life made its debut on the Euphoria High stage to much acclaim from the audience – particularly Lexi’s own mother.
To review Lexi’s play fairly, we need to do some mental gymnastics.
We must see Lexi’s characters as new creations, rather than people based on characters that we’ve got to know over the last two seasons.
Our Life, Euphoria High, reviewOur Life is an autobiographical, fourth-wall breaking story of girlhood and what it means to grow up in a broken family.
