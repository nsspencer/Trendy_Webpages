     Atletico Madrid Training XI Revealed Ahead of Manchester United UEFA Champions League Clash, With Luis Suarez and Koke Omitted
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It was revealed earlier today the starting XI that Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone used in training, ahead of their Champions League clash with Manchester United.
Span based journalist Belen Sanchez Garcia reported the training XI as follows: Oblak; Vrsaljko, Savic, Felipe, Reinildo, Lodi; Llorente, Herrera, Kondogbia; Correa, Joao Félix.
There are multiple changes from Atletico's team that beat Osasuna 3-0 on Saturday, with goal scorer Luis Suarez and Koke among the omissions.
Although it is not necessarily the team that will be picked for Wednesday's match, it makes sense that the Madrid team would use a similar XI to train as they would to play.

     Manchester United sinks Leeds in EPL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Celebrating scoring Manchester United's fourth goal, Anthony Elanga held a finger to his lips.
Leeds can't yet escape the fear that its return to the Premier League after a 16-year exile will end after two seasons.
Certainty of its Premier League status is needed to invest in a stadium shorn of much investment since Leeds was relegated in 2004 from the world's richest league.
Parts look little changed from the era that saw Leeds pip United to the title in 1992, the last season before the inception of the Premier League.
For the first time since Harry Kewell’s headed winner in September 2002, the fans at Elland Road witnessed a Premier League goal against United.

     Manchester United's Scott McTominay shows off battle scars after 'proper game' against rivals Leeds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has showed off some nasty ankle scars after a 'proper game' against Leeds on Sunday.
Scotland international McTominay got stuck in from the off and in a post on Instagram captioned 'Leeds away - proper game', the 25-year-old posted a photo of his ankle with numerous fresh scars following the contest.
McTominay escaped with a warning from the referee, while Koch continued but was later substituted in the 31st minute due to concerns over concussion.
McTominay was eventually cautioned in the 78th minute after getting nowhere near the ball with a tackle on Joe Gelhardt.
A vital win for United means they are now in fourth place, four points above West Ham below them.

(0:44)Late goals from substitutes Fred and Anthony Elanga helped Manchester United avoid a stunning second-half collapse in a 4-2 victory over Leeds United in the Premier League on Sunday.
Fred replaced Paul Pogba shortly after and proved to be the difference, linking up with Jadon Sancho before lashing the ball past Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier.
Sunday's result means United remain in fourth place, four points clear of Champions League qualification rivals West Ham United and Arsenal.
Fred put Manchester United back into the lead at Elland Road just three minutes after coming off the bench.
