     Simone Biles Defends Skier Mikaela Shiffrin As She Goes Toe To Toe With Trolls
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     of American gymnastics, Simone Biles came to the defense of American skier Mikaela Shiffrin on Thursday after she took to Instagram to share how she’s been bullied following her performance at the Beijing Games.
Shiffrin’s scores unfortunately failed in earning her an individual medal, and because of this, the haters came out hard.
“I know this all too well, I’m sorry you’re experiencing this,” she commented on Shiffrin’s post.
Her show of support to fellow athlete Shiffrin was an outpouring of the empathy she did not receive in her own moment of despair.
We’re all cheering for you, proud of you, love &amp; support you!” Biles added.

     Mikaela Shiffrin ‘not disappointed’ after fourth-place finish in team event
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mikaela Shiffrin will leave the Beijing Olympics without a medal after Team USA finished fourth in the mixed team parallel skiing event.
“I have had a lot of disappointing moments at these Games; today is not one of them.
Despite competing in every alpine skiing event, she uncharacteristically skied out of the giant slalom, slalom and alpine combined races and did not finish those races.
I can’t explain to you how frustrated I am to not know what I can learn from today,” Shiffrin said after her third DNF.
Petra Vlhová did so in 2018, the first year of the team event.

     Mikaela Shiffrin loses a last shot at a medal as the U.S. mixed team falls short.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shiffrin, 26, was hoping the team competition would help put the struggles of the past two weeks behind her.
In her other five races, all individual events, she failed to finish three runs and placed ninth and 18th in two others.
“I decided to stay because I wanted to compete with my teammates,” she said.
Two women and two men from each country compete, each racing an opponent of the same gender.
A team advances to the next round if it wins three of these races; if the teams tie, 2-2, the winner is the team with the best combined time.

     'You can rise tomorrow and keep going': Shiffrin shares story of resilience at Beijing Olympics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shiffrin considered leaving Beijing after failing to finish in her two strongest events.
BEIJING, China — The 2022 Winter Olympics have wrapped up, and for Colorado’s Mikaela Shiffrin, so did an Olympics in which she didn’t earn a medal.
Shiffrin skied off course and failed to finish in the giant slalom and the slalom -- her two strongest events.
And gosh knows failing, even failing multiple times, it doesn’t make you a failure -- it just means you didn’t do it today, but you can rise tomorrow and keep going," Shiffrin said.
And in those moments, at these Olympics, Shiffrin defined a champion not by the medal count, but by getting back up, by inspiring others and fighting to race in the sport she loves.

     Mikaela Shiffrin Ends Beijing Olympics Without a Medal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Shiffrin and the American mixed ski team missed out on a medal by 0.42 seconds, losing in the bronze matchup to Norway on Sunday.
The narrow loss meant the two-time gold medalist would leave China empty handed, but after crashing out several times at the Beijing Games, Shiffrin was riding high from a strong U.S. showing.
“I don't think you can emphasize enough how unbelievable it is for us to be here and be in the hunt for a medal,” Shiffrin said.
When mixed team debuted in 2018, 15 of that year's 23 individual medal winners skipped it, including Shiffrin.
“There's things to work out with the logistics of this event,” Shiffrin said.

     Simone Biles showed her support for fellow American Mikaela Shiffrin after the alpine skier took to social media to open up about the criticism she received for her struggles at the Beijing Olympic Games.
Shiffrin is a two-time gold medalist and was one of the United States’ medal favourites heading into these Games.
“Get up because you can, because you like what you do when [it’s] not infested with the people who have so much apparent hate for you," Shiffrin wrote.
“I know this all too well,” Biles wrote.
Or been bullied in school,” Shiffrin said Sunday after the United States placed fourth in the Alpine team event.
