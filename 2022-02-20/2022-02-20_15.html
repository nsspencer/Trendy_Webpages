     Jessie Diggins Caps Olympics Run With a Silver in 30-km Cross-Country Race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jessie Diggins came to Beijing as the only American cross-country skier—man or woman—to win a gold medal at the Olympics.
She’ll leave China as the most decorated U.S. cross-country skier ever, ending her ambitious racing schedule with a silver medal in the women’s 30-kilometer mass start on Sunday.
Earlier in the Olympics, she earned a bronze in the women’s sprint free.
“To have a medal in the sprint and the 30 km are the ultimate bookends for me.
I have been trying to be a good all-around athlete my whole life, so this has been really cool,” Diggins said.

     30 hours after food poisoning, Jessie Diggins wins silver in 30-km cross-country race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jessie Diggins made history on multiple fronts Sunday when she took the silver in the women's 30-kilometer freestyle mass start in Beijing.
Her podium finish was made even more impressive when word got out that Diggins had been suffering from food poisoning leading up to the race.
The moment that @jessdiggs became the first woman to win a distance medal in cross-country skiing history for @TeamUSA.
The United States hadn't performed particularly well in cross-country skiing before Diggins came on the scene.
Until Diggins and her teammate, Kikkan Randall, took the gold in the team sprint in 2018, the last cross-country medal Team USA brought back was in 1976, when Bill Koch took silver in the 30k.

     BEIJING — Jessie Diggins didn't cry when she lay in bed with food poisoning.
She admitted she had a moment of self-pity, but with her final race at the Beijing Olympics only hours away, that wasn't going to do any good.
On the final day of the Beijing Olympics, Diggins seized her last shot to make more history in the mountains of Zhangjiakou.
She finished second to runaway winner Therese Johaug of Norway, earning her second medal of the Beijing Games.
She advised Jessie to wait and see how she felt at the start of the race, and at each 5km checkpoint.
