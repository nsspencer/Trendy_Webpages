     WATCH: Ja Morant throws down filthy alley-oop in NBA All-Star Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     We already know that Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant is one of the rising stars in the Association.
Those watching the NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland Sunday evening got a first-hand view of Morant‚Äôs excellence and downright ridiculous athletic ability.
Just check out this reverse alley-oop Ja Morant threw down on a pass from Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young.
JA MORANT IS NOT REAL ü§¢ pic.twitter.com/0Y4oF6lWHC ‚Äî BetMGM ü¶Å (@BetMGM) February 21, 2022The dude is just 6-foot-3.
Even then, that play we saw from Ja Morant was absolutely absurd.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The superstar point guard is only the second Grizzly to start an All-Star Game.
One thing fans in Memphis and around the NBA could say, if the season ended Sunday, Ja Morant, the face of the Grizzlies, has affixed himself to the national spotlight.
Ja is just the latest in a barrage of young talent unleashed upon the NBA.
"When he's at full speed, he has like one more gear," said Denver Nuggets All-Star Nikola Jokic.
In a press conference ahead of the All-Star Game this week, Ja had his family and his work ethic "in the dark" to thank for his rise.

     2022 NBA All-Star Game: Ja Morant puts Dunk Contest to shame with two absurd alley-oop slams in first half
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In his first All-Star appearance, Morant threw down two insane dunks that showed off the vertical leap and creativity of the 6-3 budding superstar.
Morant came flying down the lane, contorting his body in the air to eventually throw down a reverse jam with his head practically at the rim.
The next one came late in the second quarter, when Young once again found Morant, this time from half-court.
It was the first NBA dunk contest since 2001 in which no dunks received a perfect score, and was quickly dubbed the "worst dunk contest ever" by many on Twitter, with a corresponding hashtag that made the rounds.
Needless to say, Morant quickly allowed us all to forget about Saturday night's disappointment with his two highlight dunks in the first half.

     The Memphis Grizzlies All-Star is one of the most exciting players in the league, blending insane athleticism with scoring prowess to become a bona fide superstar.
After participating in the NBA All-Star Game for the first time in his career, the Grizzlies star declared that his goal is to be part of the eventual NBA Top 100 ceremony in 2047.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm working for.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/EgxUdm9Xms ‚Äî Ben Golliver (@BenGolliver) February 21, 2022Ja Morant went to the All-Star Game as a starter for Team Durant.
Morant is referencing the NBA‚Äôs Top 75 ceremony this year, which was held during half-time of the All-Star Game.
In the meantime, though, Morant and the Grizzlies are focused on one thing: making a deep run in the playoffs.

The world is taking notice, and the highlights and honor of his first All-Star game is just another chapter in his meteoric rise.
