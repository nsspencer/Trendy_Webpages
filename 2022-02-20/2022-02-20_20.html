    </h2>

     Keke Wyatt and her husband Zackariah Darring are expecting their second child together.
“My husband Zackariah and I are blessed to welcome our beautiful and healthy 7lb 11ounce son, Ke’Riah Darring,” Wyatt announced on Instagram.
Wyatt married Darring in 2019 following her divorce from ex-husband Michael Ford, with whom she shares nine of her children.
Back in 2020, Keke was rumored to be pregnant again, but she shut down those rumors down, saying, “I’ve been hearing rumors going around that I’m pregnant,” Keke began her statement on Instagram last week.
Why in God’s creation would I give birth to another child, or even think about getting pregnant with a child, [when] my body hasn’t even healed?
