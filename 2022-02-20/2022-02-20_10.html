     Jamal Edwards, Force in British Rap, Dies at 31
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LONDON — Jamal Edwards, the founder of a music YouTube channel that gave an early platform to British rap stars including Stormzy, Skepta and Dave, as well as pop stars like Ed Sheeran, died on Sunday.
His death of “a sudden illness” was confirmed by his mother, Brenda Edwards, a well-known TV presenter in Britain.
Edwards set up the YouTube channel SB.TV in 2006, at first posting clips of rappers performing on street corners and in public housing projects.
A few years later, he widened the channel’s focus to include interviews, and music in other styles, including pop from emerging artists.
Edwards posted a video of Ed Sheeran in 2010, more than a year before the British singer-songwriter released his first single on a major label.
