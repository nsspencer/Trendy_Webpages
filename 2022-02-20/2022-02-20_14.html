     Suns star Chris Paul to miss at least 6-8 weeks with right thumb avulsion fracture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CLEVELAND – Chris Paul’s right thumb is going to keep him out most of the remaining regular season.
The Suns gave an official release that Paul has suffered a right thumb avulsion fracture in Wednesdays’ game against Houston and will be re-evaluated in six to eight weeks.
TNT reported Paul is going to try to play in Sunday's All-Star game at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse and get an "honorary" assist or two.
Upset, Paul reacted at referee JT Orr, who hit him with a technical for use of profanity.
Then when Paul made contact with him from behind, Orr gave him a second technical that led to an automatic ejection.

     Chris Paul, 12-time All-Star for the Phoenix Suns, was the inaugural recipient of the Kobe &amp; Gigi Bryant WNBA Advocacy Award for his “significant contributions to the advancement of girls’ and women’s basketball, and advocacy for the WNBA.” The WNBA and Vanessa Bryant presented Paul the award at Sunday’s NBA All-Star at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland.
WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert in a news release: “I have seen first-hand Chris’ appreciation of the WNBA and the game at every level for women and girls, especially in Phoenix and North Carolina, and his ardent support of our game strongly reflects the legacy of Kobe and Gigi.
The league is proud to name Chris as the inaugural recipient of the Kobe &amp; Gigi Bryant WNBA Advocacy Award, as he serves as a leader and role model for other professional athletes around growing the future of the game for young girls and all fans.”Said Paul: “I’m excited about seeing the growth in the women’s game.
I’m a big fan of the W. It’s probably been the funniest year, and last year having the WNBA team right there in our home city.
We don’t really get to do that in the league.”Editorial credit: Kathy Hutchins / Shutterstock.com

     Report: Chris Paul to miss at least 6-8 weeks with avulsion fracture in right thumb
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Phoenix Suns will have to finish most if not all of the regular season without half of its All-Star backcourt.
Just moments before the 2022 All-Star Game on Sunday, Allie LaForce of TNT reported that Chris Paul had been diagnosed with an avulsion fracture in his right thumb.
He had reportedly undergone an MRI, but the results were unknown even as he participated in All-Star Weekend events, often with a visible wrap on his injured right hand.
It’s like my hand surgeon is part of my family, but things could be a lot worse,” Paul said during Saturday’s All-Star press conference.
The Suns are coming off just their third Western Conference championship season in franchise history and are seeking to win the team’s first ever NBA championship in its 54 seasons of existence.

     The NBA’s best team will be without one of its most important players for up to two months.
Suns point guard Chris Paul suffered an avulsion fracture of his right thumb, and he will be reevaluated in 6-to-8 weeks.
The 12-time All-Star still was expected to be on the floor for a short time during Sunday’s All-Star Game in Cleveland, according to reports, with the understanding among both teams that he’d be playing injured.
Led by Paul and All-Star scorer Devin Booker, Phoenix boasts the best record in the NBA at the break.
“We’re 48-10 and if we do miss some time, I know the guys are going to hold it down,” Paul said Saturday.
