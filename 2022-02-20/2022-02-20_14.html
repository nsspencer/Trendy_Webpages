     Bernie Madoff's sister and her husband have died in a suspected murder-suicideEnlarge this image toggle caption Louis Lanzano/AP Louis Lanzano/APBOYNTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The sister of Wall Street fraudster Bernie Madoff and her husband were found dead in what investigators said was an apparent murder-suicide in Florida, according to news reports.
The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office on Sunday identified the couple as 87-year-old Sondra Wiener of Boynton Beach and her 90-year-old husband, Marvin.
After further investigation it appears to be a murder/suicide," the Sheriff's Office statement said.
A woman who identified herself as the wife of son David Wiener asked for privacy "at this time of grief."
He was sentenced to 150 years in prison after pleading guilty in 2009 to fraud and other charges and died while incarcerated at age 82 last year.

     Bernie Madoff’s Sister and Her Husband Are Found Dead in Florida
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Bernie Madoff’s sister, Sondra Wiener, and her husband were found dead on Thursday in their home in Boynton Beach, Fla., in what the authorities said was an apparent murder-suicide.
The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office said deputies responded to a 911 call and found Ms. Wiener, 87, and her husband, Marvin, 90, both dead from gunshot wounds.
The Medical Examiner’s Office personnel “arrived on the scene and took possession of both Marvin and Sondra,” according to the sheriff’s Facebook page and Twitter account.
The cause of death will be determined by the Medical Examiner’s Office.
Though the social media accounts of the Sheriff’s Office included the names of the couple, a statement from the office identified only Ms. Wiener and said the family “had invoked Marsy’s Law for the male,” which provides protections for crime victims.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The sister of Wall Street con artist Bernie Madoff and her husband were found dead last week in an apparent murder-suicide in Florida, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel.
The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Sunday that two elderly residents had been found dead in Boynton Beach on Thursday.
Both the 90-year-old man and an elderly woman were discovered dead with gunshot wounds, said the sheriff's office said, which identified the woman as Sondra Wiener, 87.
The sheriff's office did not confirm the relationship, and Wiener's family declined to comment Sunday, calling it a private family matter.
The family of the man found dead invoked Marsy's Law, which seeks to protect the privacy rights of crime victims, but the sheriff's office appeared to name him in their release.

     On Facebook, the sheriff’s office named Sondra Wiener, 87, as one of the deceased.
But in a tweet and earlier version of the Facebook post, the sheriff’s office named Marvin, 90, Sondra Wiener’s husband.

In 2009, Sondra Wiener’s son, David, told the New York Post that Madoff, the disgraced financier who masterminded what was perhaps the largest Ponzi scheme in history, defrauded his sister, as well.

     Sondra Weiner, 87, and her 90-year-old husband Marvin were discovered dead from gunshot wounds in their home Thursday afternoon in Boynton Beach, Fla., authorities said.
The Weiners were among those financially ruined by Madoff’s $65 billion Ponzi scheme.
Henrietta Kleinman, who lives on the same block as the Wieners, said, “They were very lovely people, they were nice neighbors.
The Weiners moved to the Valencia Lakes gated community following the Madoff scandal.
“It’s sad.”The Weiners were remembered as lovely people, and neighbors were shocked at their deaths.

     Bernie Madoff's Only Sister and Her Husband Dead in Suspected Murder-Suicide, Police Say

     The bodies of Sondra Wiener, 87, and 90-year-old Marvin Wiener were discovered in their residence in unincorporated Boynton Beach, The Boca Raton News was the first to report.
The Wieners — who became ensnared by Madoff's deception along with numerous others, losing millions — lived in Valencia Lakes.
The couple moved to a $315,000 three-bedroom home in Valencia Lakes in 2009, online records show.
One resident told The Palm Beach Post the Wieners were "a lovely couple."
In early 2020, the elder Madoff told The Washington Post that he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and sought a compassionate release.
