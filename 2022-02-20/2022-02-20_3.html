     Updated February 20, 2022 at 10:11 AM ETLONDON — Queen Elizabeth II tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday and is experiencing mild, cold-like symptoms, Buckingham Palace said, adding that the famously stoic 95-year-old monarch still plans to carry on working.
Both the queen's eldest son Prince Charles, 73, and her 74-year-old daughter-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall contracted COVID-19 earlier this month.
There are also thought to be several recent virus cases among staff at Windsor Castle, where the queen is staying.
The queen is the latest monarch from around the world to catch COVID-19.
Queen Margrethe of Denmark, 82, and Spain's King Felipe VI, 54, both tested positive for the illness earlier in February and had mild symptoms.
