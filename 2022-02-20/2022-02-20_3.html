     Winter storm forecast for large swath of Minnesota today, Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Warm, sunny weather with temperatures in the 40s brought Minnesota a brief reprieve from winter on Sunday, but the season isn't done with Minnesota yet.
The National Weather Service says an area extending west to east across the state that includes St.
The Twin Cities is a bit south of that line but still has a strong chance of that much accumulation, the Weather Service said.
The Minnesota Department of Transportation shut down multiple highways in northwestern Minnesota on Friday, and the Minnesota State Patrol said that it is investigating a pile-up crash late Friday morning involving 20 to 30 cars on Highway 371 north of Brainerd.
The National Weather Service said Saturday morning that wind gusts in the previous 24 hours reached as high as 61 miles per hour at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
