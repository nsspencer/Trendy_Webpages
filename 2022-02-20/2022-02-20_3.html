     If you use music or meditation apps to help you drift off to sleep, consider a pair of sleep headphones.
AcousticSheep’s SleepPhones come in a headband style, delivering the most comfortable speaker design of all the sleep headphones we tested.
It even has removable electronics, so you can wash or replace the headband as needed.
Its battery life lasts for 12 to 13 hours, but it’s very slow to charge, taking about three hours to go from dead to full.
That said, if your heart is set on sleep headphones and you don’t mind the drawbacks, this deal with the code WCSLEEP is a great chance to try a pair out for less.
