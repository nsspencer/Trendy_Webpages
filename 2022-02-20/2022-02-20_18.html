     Young, a 25-year-old rookie who looks and acts like a grizzled veteran, hung with Niemann step for step on the weekend.
He trailed by two after two rounds and trailed by two after four.
It is the Wake Forest grad’s second runner-up finish this season after a T-2 at the Sanderson Farms Classic last fall.
After the round, Young was asked if he planned to play the Arnold Palmer Invitational in two weeks.
“If they let me in,” he said, not yet aware that he jumped from No.

“I want to compete with the best players in the world, I want to be No.

Getty ImagesJoaquin Niemann set records all week long at Riviera.
The 23-year-old Chilean breezed to his second career PGA Tour title by winning the Genesis Invitational on Sunday at Riviera, closing with an even-par 71 to beat Collin Morikawa and Cameron Young by two.
His opening-round 63 tied the lowest first-round score in Genesis Invitational history, and he set both 36-hole (126, 16 under) and 54-hole (194, 19 under) scoring records.
Leading Morikawa and Young by two on the 18th, Niemann found the fairway, found the green and two-putted to victory.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Joaquin Niemann finishes off his strong week at the Genesis Invitational to become the first wire-to-wire winner of the event in 53 years.
"Winning a PGA Tour event, getting a trophy, having Tiger there, all the history behind it, there's nothing that can compete with this."
About the only thing Niemann missed was a chance to break the oldest tournament scoring record on the PGA Tour.
As for Niemann, the tournament hasn't had a 23-year-old winner since Phil Rodgers in 1962, the tournament best known for Jack Nicklaus making his pro debut.
This year is the 100th anniversary of when Sifford, the first Black golfer to win on the PGA Tour, was born.
