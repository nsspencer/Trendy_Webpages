     2022 NBA All-Star Game: Ja Morant puts Dunk Contest to shame with two absurd alley-oop slams in first half
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In his first All-Star appearance, Morant threw down two insane dunks that showed off the vertical leap and creativity of the 6-3 budding superstar.
Morant came flying down the lane, contorting his body in the air to eventually throw down a reverse jam with his head practically at the rim.
The next one came late in the second quarter, when Young once again found Morant, this time from half-court.
It was the first NBA dunk contest since 2001 in which no dunks received a perfect score, and was quickly dubbed the "worst dunk contest ever" by many on Twitter, with a corresponding hashtag that made the rounds.
Needless to say, Morant quickly allowed us all to forget about Saturday night's disappointment with his two highlight dunks in the first half.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - One of the biggest nights of the NBA season had a little grit and grind to it this year.
Ja Morant, the Memphis Grizzlies star, was featured as a starter for team Durant at the 71st NBA All-Star game, and there was a lot of excitement in Memphis for it.
“I’m just happy to be a Memphian, happy to be a part of Grizz nation, happy to have Ja,” said BLJ, the Grizzlies hype man.
The #NBAAllStar game has watch parties in Memphis cheering on our own @JaMorant.
pic.twitter.com/VwhRoyX0l3 — Parker King (@King_Reports) February 21, 2022Many in Memphis and the Mid-South will agree with BLJ’s statement, especially after Sunday night’s introduction of Ja Morant to the NBA All-Star game.

     As it turned out, maybe the most significant shot Ja Morant took during his first NBA All-Star game appearance occurred on an airplane.
Maybe Morant decided to defer to the politics that play out behind-the-scenes with veterans of this event jockeying to take home the MVP trophy.
GIANNOTTO:As Ja Morant's NBA All-Star moment arrives, a Bruce Pearl compliment still stingsGIANNOTTO:Grizzlies' Ja Morant soars into rare air with all-time greats as NBA all-star starterSo when it was over late Sunday, after Morant had a couple jaw-dropping alley-oops but largely remained in the background on an evening that highlighted the NBA’s 75th anniversary team, "Ja Morant plane" and “Ja Morant drunk” were still trending on Twitter.
Morant generated the seventh-most All-Star game fan votes of the players who appeared in Sunday's game, but he played fewer minutes than 15 players.
Maybe, like this All-Star weekend, the biggest moments for now are the journey to arrive on the same stage as the NBA’s best.

     Ja Morant became the second Memphis Grizzly to be named an All-Star starter, becoming the youngest player in franchise history to earn this honor.
But we’re here for Ja Morant ... only if Erik Spoelstra got the memo.
The other one is that the Ja Morant has the world on notice.
Ja Morant is a superstar.
The world is taking notice, and the highlights and honor of his first All-Star game is just another chapter in his meteoric rise.
