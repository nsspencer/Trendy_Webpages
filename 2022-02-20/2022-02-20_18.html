     Nets news: Kevin Durant will skip 75th Anniversary Team ceremony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Brooklyn Nets superstar Kevin Durant won’t be able to attend the NBA 75th Anniversary Team ceremony during the All-Star Game on Sunday due to a death in the family.
KD’s mother Wanda Durant confirmed the sad news, and so the Nets forward decided to skip the NBA All-Star ceremony to mourn the loss.
The grandmother of Kevin Durant passed away this morning, Wanda Durant announces.
Kevin Durant – named one of the 75 greatest players ever – will no longer attend 75th Anniversary team ceremony tonight at NBA All-Star Game as the family mourns loss.
Kevin Durant made the list alongside his Nets head coach Steve Nash and former teammate James Harden, who is now with the Philadelphia 76ers.

     Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant was named a captain for the 2022 NBA All-Star Game by virtue of receiving the most fan votes of any player in the Eastern Conference.
He was not scheduled to play in the game due to a knee injury, but now Durant will no longer be in attendance at all.
On Sunday, Durant's mother, Wanda, announced on Instagram that Barbara Davis, her mother and Kevin Durant's grandmother, died on Sunday.
"It is with great sadness that we share with family and friends that our Dear Sweet Mama, BARBARA A. Davis, transitioned early this morning," Wanda Durant wrote.
It's no surprise that he would skip the All-Star Game in order to be with his mother and family during this difficult time.

     Steph Curry said he was "humbled" to honour the late, great Kobe Bryant by setting new ground in Sunday's NBA All-Star game.
The Golden State Warriors superstar nailed 16 three-pointers as Team LeBron defeated Team Durant 163-160 – a new benchmark for the annual exhibition contest.
He had vowed to donate $1,000 for every point he scored, $3,000 for every three he made, and $10,000 if he won All-Star MVP recognition to the Cleveland Metro School District.
Home favourite James, who is now 5-0 as a captain in the All-Star game, fittingly hit the game-winning shot after receiving a rousing reception from the fans in attendance.
But James paid tribute to Curry, a man who was for so long his rival while representing the Cleveland Cavaliers in their battles with the Warriors for the NBA title.
