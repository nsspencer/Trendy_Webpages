     Manchester United sinks Leeds in EPL

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Celebrating scoring Manchester United's fourth goal, Anthony Elanga held a finger to his lips.
Leeds can't yet escape the fear that its return to the Premier League after a 16-year exile will end after two seasons.
Certainty of its Premier League status is needed to invest in a stadium shorn of much investment since Leeds was relegated in 2004 from the world's richest league.
Parts look little changed from the era that saw Leeds pip United to the title in 1992, the last season before the inception of the Premier League.
For the first time since Harry Kewell’s headed winner in September 2002, the fans at Elland Road witnessed a Premier League goal against United.

We want to be physical, hard-working group that wants to play a physical game as well as a skilful game.

     Manchester United's Scott McTominay shows off battle scars after 'proper game' against rivals Leeds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has showed off some nasty ankle scars after a 'proper game' against Leeds on Sunday.
Scotland international McTominay got stuck in from the off and in a post on Instagram captioned 'Leeds away - proper game', the 25-year-old posted a photo of his ankle with numerous fresh scars following the contest.
McTominay escaped with a warning from the referee, while Koch continued but was later substituted in the 31st minute due to concerns over concussion.
McTominay was eventually cautioned in the 78th minute after getting nowhere near the ball with a tackle on Joe Gelhardt.
A vital win for United means they are now in fourth place, four points above West Ham below them.
