     A Washington Post reporter early Monday was able to download the app and submit an email address to create an account, but a verification email was not immediately received.
Reuters reported that the app was set to be released in full on Monday, Presidents’ Day, according to an executive’s posts on a beta version of the platform.
The Post reported in January that it could be months after launch before the app is fully functional.
Trump has been frustrated with the pace of the network’s development, people familiar with the matter told The Post at the time.
He and other conservative politicians have long charged that popular social networks were trying to censor them.

     REUTERS/Octavio JonesFeb 21 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's new social media venture, Truth Social, launched late on Sunday in Apple's App Store, potentially marking the former president's return to social media after he was banned from several platforms last year.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Donald Trump's new social media platform, Truth Social, has gone live in the Apple app store, with a number of right-wing figures already sharing their accounts.
Of course, one top GOP figure who has set up an account on Truth Social is Trump himself.
The screen shot also confirmed previous reports that Truth Social, created by the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), is almost identical looking to Twitter's interface.
I am speaking Truth on Truth Social.
Social media experts previously questioned if Truth Social, yet another right-wing "free speech" app in a similar vein to Gab, Gettr, and Parler, will prove to be a success if only conservatives use it.

     Getty ImagesFormer US President Donald Trump's social media app Truth Social became available for download in Apple's App Store on Sunday night but some users are having trouble creating an account.
People who preordered Truth Social had the app automatically downloaded to their iPhones.
Truth Social, which looks similar to Twitter, is also another example of an alternative social media app like Parler, Gettr and Rumble that conservatives are flocking to because of censorship concerns.
On Feb. 15, Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. posted what he said was the former president's first post on Truth Social.
About 500 people have reportedly started using an early version of Truth Social, Reuters reported last week.

     Donald Trump's social media app, Truth Social, launched on Apple's App Store late Sunday.

     Truth Social, run by Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, was announced in October.
“TRUTH Social is America’s ‘Big Tent’ social media platform that encourages an open, free and honest global conversation without discriminating against political ideology,” the website claims.
Reuters reported Sunday that Truth Social appears ready to launch in Apple’s App Store on Monday, which is President’s Day.
Many on the right have turned to Gettr, Parler and Rumble in the wake of Trump’s social media absence, but the established platforms still dominate.
Miller congratulated the former president on Truth Social back in October, noting the two were unable to reach a deal on their twin social media sites.
