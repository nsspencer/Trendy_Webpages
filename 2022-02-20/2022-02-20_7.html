     Why George Washington has two birthdays — and neither falls on Presidents’ Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Yes, there were exactly 365 days between Feb. 11, 1750, and Feb. 22, 1752.
In the Gregorian calendar, the rules of adding a leap day are a little more complicated than how we usually think of it.
New Year’s Day, the day the calendar year changed, used to happen in late March, as it was more associated with spring.
That is why, depending on which calendar you are using, Washington was born on both Feb. 11, 1731, and Feb. 22, 1732.
That’s what Washington and Benjamin Franklin — the tech geeks of their day — did, though most people stuck with their Julian birthdays and griped about having 11 days “stolen” from them.
