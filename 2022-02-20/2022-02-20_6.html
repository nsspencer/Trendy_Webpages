     WATCH: LeBron James Can’t Hide His Laughter During Macy Gray’s All-Star Rendition of the National Anthem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Macy Gray sang the national anthem prior to Sunday night’s NBA All-Star Game and LeBron James couldn’t help but laugh during the performance.
Gray was accompanied by a guitarist and certainly put her own creative spin on the song to provide a unique All-Star rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner.
A little more than halfway through the national anthem, TNT cameras panned to James, who had a giant smirk on his face.
As James looked up to see he was being displayed on the jumbotron, the Lakers superstar seemingly ducked with embarrassment.
The smile from James might have been ignored if not for a memorable 2018 All-Star Game national anthem performance, when he and other NBA stars were stunned and confused by Fergie’s bizarre rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner.

APIt’s not the first time the All-Star Game has provided amusement for James, who is playing in his 18th edition of the game and captaining one of the squads.
As James and Kevin Durant drafted their respective teams for the game, James couldn’t hold back his laughter, and covered his face, as Durant explained his reasoning for selecting Rudy Gobert over James Harden when the two were the only remaining players yet to be chosen.

     Macy Gray's NBA All-Star National Anthem Gets Grin from LeBron James
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Macy Gray’s the latest to try something different with the National Anthem during the NBA All-Star weekend ... and yet again, it evoked some would-be chuckles from the players.
He was standing next to Steph Curry, who kept his composure this time ... and you can see LBJ with a big grin on his face as Macy sings.
When he looks up to the Jumbotron and sees his reaction was captured, he bows his head in embarrassment -- trying to hide.
When Bill Murray is terrified by Macy Gray’s rendition of the Star Spangled Banner.
Funny enough, she’s actually had some thoughts on Old Glory of late ... suggesting the flag needs to be redesigned to reflect modern-day America.

     Macy Gray Clowned For National Anthem Performance At NBA All-Star Game, Twitter Reacts
    </h2>

     Macy Gray said she was “nervous af” ahead of her performance of the “Star-Spangled Banner” at the All-Star Game on Sunday.
Macy Gray fans have come out in defense of the singer following her rendition of the National Anthem during the NBA All-Star weekend.
Earlier in the day, Macy Gray explained she was “nervous af” ahead of the show.
Both singers belted out a less-than-traditional version of the song, and like Fergie, Macy Gray also raised some eyebrows.
“I loved Macy Gray’s version of the National Anthem at NBA Allstars game,” wrote one on Twitter.
