     Leeds face FA sanctions after Man United's Anthony Elanga struck by missile
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manchester United's Anthony Elanga was struck by an object thrown by the stands while celebrating a goal.
- Ogden: Maguire, Man United respond to Leeds hostilityOne supporter ran onto the pitch at the end of the game before being stopped by stewards, but Leeds could also face sanction for that incident.
Sunday's fixture was the first time the two clubs had met in a Premier League game in front of supporters at Elland Road for 19 years.
The long-standing hostility between the two clubs resulted in 900 police officers being on duty for the game -- a record for a Premier League fixture.
Leeds will face an automatic £25,000 fine for failing to control their players after receiving six yellow cards during the game.

     Manchester United sinks Leeds in EPL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Celebrating scoring Manchester United's fourth goal, Anthony Elanga held a finger to his lips.
Leeds can't yet escape the fear that its return to the Premier League after a 16-year exile will end after two seasons.
Certainty of its Premier League status is needed to invest in a stadium shorn of much investment since Leeds was relegated in 2004 from the world's richest league.
Parts look little changed from the era that saw Leeds pip United to the title in 1992, the last season before the inception of the Premier League.
For the first time since Harry Kewell’s headed winner in September 2002, the fans at Elland Road witnessed a Premier League goal against United.

     Manchester United's Scott McTominay shows off battle scars after 'proper game' against rivals Leeds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has showed off some nasty ankle scars after a 'proper game' against Leeds on Sunday.
Scotland international McTominay got stuck in from the off and in a post on Instagram captioned 'Leeds away - proper game', the 25-year-old posted a photo of his ankle with numerous fresh scars following the contest.
McTominay escaped with a warning from the referee, while Koch continued but was later substituted in the 31st minute due to concerns over concussion.
McTominay was eventually cautioned in the 78th minute after getting nowhere near the ball with a tackle on Joe Gelhardt.
A vital win for United means they are now in fourth place, four points above West Ham below them.

     "Manchester United needed these points in the bag.
"I still don't think it is plain-sailing and I still think it could turn quite quickly as I don't think it is stable behind the scenes at all."
"I don't think he gets the job at the end of the season, come what may, now," he added.
Manchester United will have a new manager next season.
He has got good experience around building structures in football clubs and Manchester United do need that.
