     Michigan Coach Juwan Howard Suspended for Rest of Regular Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After slapping an assistant coach for the Wisconsin men’s basketball team in the head in the handshake line after his team’s loss on Sunday, Michigan Coach Juwan Howard was suspended for five games — the remainder of the regular season — and fined $40,000, the Big Ten Conference announced on Monday.
In a statement on Monday, Howard apologized for the first time.
“I am truly sorry.”Michigan forwards Terrance Williams II and Moussa Diabaté, who were involved in the fracas, were suspended for one game each, the conference said.
Wisconsin Coach Greg Gard was fined $10,000 for his role in the altercation but not suspended.
“Big Ten Conference coaches and student-athletes are expected to display the highest level of sportsmanship conduct,” the Big Ten commissioner, Kevin Warren, said in a statement.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Juwan Howard, the head coach of the University of Michigan men’s basketball team, was suspended for the rest of the regular season for his part in a postgame fracas in which he appeared to strike a University of Wisconsin assistant coach in the head.
Big Ten Conference officials ruled that Howard was in “clear violation” of the league’s sportsmanship policy.
Wisconsin head coach Greg Gard was also found to have violated the sportsmanship policy and was fined $10,000.
“Big Ten Conference coaches and student-athletes are expected to display the highest level of sportsmanship conduct,” Commissioner Kevin Warren said in a statement.
After the incident, Michigan Athletic Director Warde Manuel said, “There is no excuse for any of our staff or student-athletes to get into a physical altercation with others regardless of instigating factors.”

     Michigan-Wisconsin fight: Why Juwan Howard now needs to be a better leader
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Michigan coach is emerging from Sunday's incident at Wisconsin with his job, and a chance to do better.
The Michigan coach said his postgame anger was a byproduct of Wisconsin coach Greg Gard’s last-minute timeout call with the game in control.
In this situation, Gard did initiate the confrontation by grabbing Howard’s arm and setting him off, as Howard repeatedly said “Don’t f------ touch me.
At that point, I thought it was time to protect myself.”In neither situation did Howard appear to be in physical danger.

     Wisconsin coach Greg Gard was fined $10,000 for violating the conference’s sportsmanship policy, but was not suspended.
Howard is expected to be back for the Big Ten tournament, which begins March 9 in Indianapolis.
Howard was upset after Gard called a timeout with 15 seconds left and his team leading by 15 on Sunday.
Last season, Howard got into a shouting match with then-Maryland coach Mark Turgeon and had to be restrained during the conference tournament.
Howard is in his third season as Michigan’s coach after being part of Michigan’s Fab Five teams three decades ago.
