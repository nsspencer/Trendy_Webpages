After Wisconsin beat Michigan on Sunday in a Big Ten Conference basketball game, members of both teams fought after Michigan head coach Juwan Howard slapped Wisconsin assistant coach Joe Krabbenhoft in the head.
Howard explained after the melee that he was upset Wisconsin had called a timeout with a few seconds left in the game when Wisconsin was already up 14 points.
As the teams lined up to shake hands after the game, Wisconsin head coach Greg Gard grabbed Howard's arm and appeared to try to talk with him.
In a postgame press conference, Gard said he tried to explain to Howard why he called the timeout.

     Michigan head coach Juwan Howard throws punch at end of college basketball game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Michigan men's basketball head coach Juwan Howard threw a punch during postgame handshakes after his team's game against Wisconsin on Sunday.
Following the Michigan Wolverines' 77-63 loss against the Wisconsin Badgers, Howard and Wisconsin's head coach Greg Gard shook hands, and Howard could be seen saying something to Gard.
Gard grabbed Howard with his left hand to stop the Michigan coach from moving to the next person to shake hands with, which seemed to anger Howard.
After arguing for a few moments, the two were separated before another Wisconsin assistant began shouting at Howard.
Shortly after, Howard threw a punch towards a member of the Badgers coaching team, sparking pushing and shoving between both sets of players and staff.

     New On-Court Video Includes Audio of Lead-up to Juwan Howard-Greg Gard Altercation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     New raw video has emerged from the moments leading up to the altercation between Michigan’s Juwan Howard and Wisconsin’s Greg Gard.
Please note the video is raw and unedited, and contains language that is not suitable for all viewers.
The video began with Howard approaching Gard in the handshake line, visibly upset saying, “I’ll remember that s---.”At that moment, Gard grabbed Howard’s shirt and Howard escalated saying, "Don’t f------ touch me!"
At that point, the audio becomes mostly incoherent as multiple members of Michigan and Wisconsin’s staff tried to intervene in the altercation.
Had Gard not called timeout, Wisconsin would have had only four seconds to get the ball across halfcourt to dribble out the clock.

     Michigan men's basketball coach Juwan Howard hit Wisconsin assistant Joe Krabbenhoft's face in the postgame handshake line between the teams, setting off a brawl involving coaches and players from both sides.
Wisconsin coach Greg Gard stopped Howard in the handshake line, leading to the two men exchanging words before being surrounded by a few players and coaches.
"The Big Ten Conference is aware of a physical altercation involving Michigan Head Coach Juwan Howard at the conclusion of the Michigan Wolverines and Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball game.
At last year's Big Ten tournament, Howard was ejected after getting into a shouting match with Maryland coach Mark Turgeon.
The two head coaches exchanged words before Howard began walking toward Turgeon, with Howard needing to be held back by his assistant coaches.

     Michigan basketball coach Juwan Howard erupts, brawl goes viral after game against Wisconsin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     What seemed like a normal college basketball game turned into a viral sensation Sunday after University of Michigan coach Juwan Howard erupted in anger after his arm was grabbed and he appeared to strike an opposing coach.
Michigan lost to Wisconsin 77-63, and as the two teams shook hands at the close of the game, Wisconsin's head coach, Greg Gard, appeared to grab Howard after it appeared that Howard was slow to shake his hand.
In a video of the scuffle, Gard seems to grab Howard when he doesn't offer a handshake, and the two appear to have a heated exchange.
It appeared Howard had to be restrained by members of his team at least twice, according to video of the incident.
Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement that a review will be launched and disciplinary action will be considered.

In short, Howard admitted to not liking the timeout and telling Gard about in the postgame handshake line.
He later added, “At that point, I thought it was time to protect myself.”MORE: Howard, Gard explain postgame brawlIt was not the first time Howard offered a similar defense.
