    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Updated February 20, 2022 at 10:11 AM ETLONDON — Queen Elizabeth II tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday and is experiencing mild, cold-like symptoms, Buckingham Palace said, adding that the famously stoic 95-year-old monarch still plans to carry on working.
Both the queen's eldest son Prince Charles, 73, and her 74-year-old daughter-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall contracted COVID-19 earlier this month.
There are also thought to be several recent virus cases among staff at Windsor Castle, where the queen is staying.
The queen is the latest monarch from around the world to catch COVID-19.
Queen Margrethe of Denmark, 82, and Spain's King Felipe VI, 54, both tested positive for the illness earlier in February and had mild symptoms.

     Queen Elizabeth II Is Working Through COVID
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Just ten days after Prince Charles tested positive for the virus, and six days after his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, confirmed she also had COVID, Queen Elizabeth II has tested positive for the coronavirus.
(Granted, so far her public duties during COVID have consisted of releasing a congratulatory message to Great Britain’s curling team on their Olympic victory.)
Queen Elizabeth has been keeping a very low profile since the COVID-19 pandemic began, isolating at Windsor Castle and limiting social gatherings, both private and public.
Per the New York Times, she also had contact with her son Prince Charles on February 8, two days before he tested positive.
Though her symptoms appear to be mild, Queen Elizabeth is 95 years old, which puts her at a higher risk for complications, and her health has reportedly been in decline in recent years.
