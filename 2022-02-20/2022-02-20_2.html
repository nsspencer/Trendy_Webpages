     Lakers: LeBron James Hits Ridiculous Shot to Win the NBA All-Star Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 2022 NBA All-Star break might not have been everything fans had hoped for.
The events leading up to Sunday night's All-Star Game weren't all that great, and the always entertaining Dunk Contest drew the ire of almost everyone around the league.
But the All-Star Game on Sunday brought a little bit more excitement to the weekend.
With Team LeBron facing off against Team Durant, the stage was set for a whole lot of offense.
Speaking of Curry, he dropped 50 points en route to becoming the All-Star Game MVP.

Many places, such as downtown’s Harry Buffalo, were rented out for private parties.
Cleveland area hotels were half full last year due to the pandemic but were sold out this past week.
Reddy, a partner with Ariel Ventures, she said the NBA All-Star Game filled her hotel.
“We did do an ad targeting NBA customers on Facebook and we were very fortunate to get NBA people to come and stay,” Reddy said.

     2022 NBA All-Star Game: Stephen Curry earns MVP after demolishing record for most 3-pointers in single game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry is having the worst 3-point shooting season of his career, but during Sunday's NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland, he reminded everyone why he's the greatest shooter of all time.
His thrilling performance in Team LeBron's 163-160 win over Team Durant earned him the 2022 Kobe Bryant NBA All-Star Game MVP, the first time he's received the honor in eight career All-Star Games.
With his 10th 3-pointer of the game during the third quarter, Curry broke Paul George's record for the most 3-pointers in a single All-Star Game.
Curry's final tally of 50 points was just two away from Anthony Davis' All-Star Game record of 52, set in 2017.
With his performance, Curry -- who was born in Akron, Ohio -- also raised over $100,000 for the Cleveland Metro School District.

     NBA All-Star Weekend 2022 is in the books.
Please rate each piece on a scale of 1-10.”Contrast the NBA All-Star weekend events with a spectacle that ran alongside them this year: The Olympics.
What do the Olympics have that the more-comprehensible, and theoretically more exciting, NBA All-Star events don’t?
But we’re not talking about NBA All-Star weekend actually equaling the Olympics, just picking up some of that inherent interest.
Both they, and the actual All-Star Game, have codified rules already, so they don’t need help in that vein.
