     5 biggest reveals in the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania trailer
    </h2>

     Summary: As the Marvel Cinematic Universe lurches into Phase 5, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has a big task ahead of it.
Here’s everything you need to know about the film’s new trailer, from the huge reveals to the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it secrets.
Then Marvel announced we’d have to wait two years to meet Kang, so there’s been quite the build-up.
The Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania trailer establishes what makes Kang a villain to Ant-Man specifically: he makes a bargain with Scott to give him years back with his daughter Cassie.
Marvel StudiosIn the lead-up to Quantumania, we’ve seen several mystical powers without clear explanations.

     Breaking down the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A new trailer for Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania gives Marvel fans a big little look at the next installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is only about a month away.
It’s not an Ant-Man trailer like any we’ve seen before, being short on jokes and long on angst, but let’s dig into those details before Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly return for the third and presumably final Ant-Man movie in February.
Of course, the only problem with this universe is that Kang the Conqueror appears to control it.
In Quantumania, he appears to be played by Corey Stoll, who portrayed the villainous Yellowjacket in 2015’s Ant-Man, where he was ultimately dispatched by being forced to shrink uncontrollably — and presumably into the Quantum Realm.
This trailer goes heavy on the foreshadowing, almost aggressively teasing Scott’s death at the end of this movie.

     The ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’ Trailer Doesn’t Hold Back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The latest trailer for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania debuted during a one-sided college football national championship on Monday night, providing a closer look at what will be the first film of the MCU’s Phase 5 when it arrives on February 17.
But in the latest trailer, Kang is front and center.
“You’re an interesting man, Scott Lang,” Kang says to open the preview.
Cassie’s technological breakthrough naturally gets the Ant-Man clan into trouble as they’re all sucked into the Quantum Realm.
The preview ends with Kang offering Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) an ominous deal that would return him and his family to their own dimension.
