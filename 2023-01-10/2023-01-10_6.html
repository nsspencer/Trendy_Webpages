The reviews came out, and I remember someone going, ‘Oh God, it’s not good.’ And my publicist going, ‘It’s really not good,'” Farrell said at The Hollywood Reporter‘s recent Actor Roundtable.
If you have, I’m really sorry.’ I’m not even joking.
I went, ‘I’m just shite at it.
And I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to reconnect with the simplicity that should never leave the core of what we do.”Main Image: Colin Farrell in Alexander.

     Alexander: Colin Farrell felt such shame after failure of the Oliver Stone epic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nearly twenty years ago, Oliver Stone set out to tell the life story of the ancient Macedonian general and king Alexander the Great.
Alexander was a story that Oliver Stone had dreamed of since he was in college.
“ This is not to apologize — I was a young man — but Alexander really made me go, ‘I don’t know,’ ” Farrell explained.
“Despite the failure of Alexander in theaters, the film has enjoyed a long life on home media, with Oliver Stone releasing three different cuts of the movie.
In addition to the theatrical cut, Stone released the Director’s Cut in 2005, followed by the Final Cut in 2007, and the Ultimate Cut in 2014.

By James Brizuela |Colin Farrell has been in plenty of amazing movies during his career, but one of his features happens to be the biggest disaster of his career: Alexander.
Even worse is that Colin Farrell thought the movie was going to be his ticket to the Academy Awards.
The movie would become one of the worst ventures for Colin Farrell, and the rest of the massive cast included.
Oddly enough, though Alexander would become a box office disaster for Colin Farrell, it would make a ton of money in DVD sales.
