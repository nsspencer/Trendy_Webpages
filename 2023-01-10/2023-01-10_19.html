     Ban new gas stoves, a federal safety commissioner proposes; CPSC says no such official plan yet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A commissioner with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is proposing a ban on gas stoves, calling them a "hidden hazard."
"To be clear, CPSC isn’t coming for anyone’s gas stoves.
Regulations apply to new products," he said, adding the newly passed Inflation Reduction Act includes a $840 rebate to replace equipment like gas stoves.
An estimated 40% of American homes still rely on gas stoves.
“A ban on gas cooking appliances would remove an affordable and preferred technology used in more than 40% of homes across the country," it said.

     Federal agency is considering a ban on gas stoves in the US, report says: 'Hidden hazard'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal agency is reportedly considering a ban on gas stoves on the heels of rising concern about harmful indoor air pollutants emitted by the appliances.
"To be clear, CPSC isn't coming for anyone's gas stoves," Trumka tweeted late Monday.
Commission staff also continues to work with voluntary standards organizations to examine gas stove emissions and address potential hazards."
The CPSC has been considering action on gas stoves since the fall.
"Our results quantify the U.S. public health burden attributed to gas stove use and childhood asthma," researchers wrote.

     Joe Biden Is Thinking About Banning Your Gas Stove
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden Administration is considering a ban on gas stoves.
Gas stoves are also a greenhouse gas contributor.
While gas advocates argue that gas appliance health concerns are miniscule compared to other things like cigarettes, environmental law experts tell CNN that banning gas stoves is “low-hanging fruit” in humanity’s battle with climate change.
As for the millions of gas stoves out there already, the Biden Administration has a plan for that.
For now, gas stoves are safe from federal regulation, but those arguing for a ban are now, ironically, “cooking with gas.”

     Is Biden Administration Banning Gas Stoves Over Climate Change Concerns?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Advertisment:Claim: U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is planning to ban gas stoves over concerns surrounding climate change.
Some social media users claimed that U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was considering such a ban over climate change concerns.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have linked air pollutants from gas stoves to a range of health concerns, including cardiovascular problems and cancer.
They pointed out that more than 40 million homes in the U.S. rely on gas stoves for cooking, and "methane leaks from gas stoves inside U.S. homes were recently found to contribute the equivalent climate impacts as about 500,000 gasoline-powered cars."
Another option besides imposing a ban on the import and manufacturing of gas stoves was to set standards on emissions from the stoves.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some cities — including Los Angeles, Seattle and New York — have already moved to ban gas stoves in certain new homes and apartments.
Kathy Hochul (D), the governor of New York, has also proposed banning gas hookups, including for gas stoves, in new buildings in the entire state.
But gas stoves are burning natural gas, a mix of methane and other chemicals.
The American Gas Association pushed back against the recent research and on natural gas cooking and asthma.
“Any efforts to ban highly efficient natural gas stoves should raise alarm bells for the 187 million Americans who depend on this essential fuel every day,” they said in a statement.

     What the Potential Ban on Gas Stoves Means If You Have One
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The agency plans to open public comment on hazards posed by gas stoves in March, according to the agency’s yearly operating plan.
“To be clear, CPSC isn’t coming for anyone’s gas stoves,” Trumka tweeted on Monday.
Natural gas stoves are currently used in about a third of households in the U.S., or about 40 million homes.
“I think having a mandatory performance standard and warning labels on gas stoves would be huge,” she says.
More fodder in the war on gas that will hurt low-income homes and small biz.”An outright ban on gas stoves could have a particularly significant impact on Asian restaurants, which often require very hot flash frying that can only be achieved with gas stoves.
