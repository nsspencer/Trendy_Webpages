    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the many, many joys in Everything Everywhere All at One is seeing actor Ke Huy Quan back on the big screen.
Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter as part of a recent actors award roundtable, Quan revealed that his lawyer is none other than Jeff Cohen.

He too left acting decades ago, in his case to become an entertainment lawyer, and it was Cohen who helped Quan close his deal to appear in the film.
“Jeff Cohen, who was in The Goonies with me—he’s Chunk—he’s all grown now and he’s an entertainment lawyer so he’s my entertainment lawyer,” Quan explained, which elicited the laughs of fellow participants like Adam Sandler and Colin Farrell.

     Summary: Ke Huy Quan has won the Golden Globe for best supporting actor in a motion picture.
The role is also significant for Quan personally, as it marks his return to acting after more than two decades working behind the camera.
Opportunities for Asian actors during that time were scarce, Quan has said.
