     HBO Confidently Adapts Breakthrough Video Game The Last of Us
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first half of the first episode unfurls the devastating prologue to the game, introducing Joel (Pedro Pascal), an Austin-based contractor, and his brother Tommy (Gabriel Luna).
In a world with few supplies, Joel is now a smuggler, working with a woman named Tess (Anna Torv) on the fringe of society.
The Fireflies, led by a woman named Marlene (Merle Dandridge, the character's voice actor from the game), are holding a girl named Ellie (Bella Ramsey) captive.
For example, the third episode consists almost entirely of a flashback to what happened to a minor character from the game named Bill (Nick Offerman) during the outbreak and subsequent two decades.
The seventh chapter adapts the excellent expansion "Left Behind," filling in the essential back story for Ellie.

     'The Last of Us' Review: All Flesh, No Bones
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Twenty years after the zombie apocalypse began, Ellie is the world’s new hope, the first person to anyone’s knowledge who’s resistant to the fungal Cordyceps brain infection that caused the zombie outbreak.
The same details that can be so immersive in the game become mere window dressing for the apocalypse here.
Take the fifth episode, in which Joel and Ellie confront a cult of personality led by would-be authoritarian Kathleen (Melanie Lynskey) in Kansas City.
And the more that the characters explain and conjecture, the less substantive the creators’ ostensibly clever rewrite of the zombie apocalypse seems.
In the end, by stripping out the gameplay from a vivid genre game that’s fleshed out by cinematic and televisual tropes, the series ends up as mostly just the latter: all flesh, no bones.

     HBO's The Last Of Us Is A Safe Show That's Caught Between Big Changes, Expectations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the fact that a playthrough of The Last of Us takes about 15 hours has always made me associate it more with prestige TV than with movies.
Nowadays, a great many games have prestige TV vibes, and that really started with The Last of Us.
And now, the game that always felt like a product of the same pop culture era that gave us prestige TV such as Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones has become prestige TV.
The only big change that’s early enough for me to talk about right now is the prologue focusing on Joel’s daughter, Sarah.
AdvertisementThere are also elements—certain needle drops and other prestige TV signifiers—that the series trots out in ways that feel perfunctory or obligatory, things it’s doing not because they reflect any particular artistic impulse but just because these are the kinds of things that prestige TV does and The Last of Us wants to remind you that it is prestige TV.

     HBO’s ‘The Last Of Us’ Show Reviews Are In, And They Are Stellar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Right now, the series has a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, albeit only from eight critics (update, now 29 critics, still 100%).
The TV adaptation doesn’t veer far from the script set by the video game.
That really does not happen often with video game adaptations, and when it does, it often goes poorly.
There are hints of HBO’s other post-apocalyptic masterpiece here—Station Eleven—though I suppose the zombies make it a little less poetic.
The opposite seems to have happened, a game-faithful adaptation that also works as a blockbuster HBO series.

     Review: 'The Last of Us' Is Gorgeous—But Something’s Missing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The plot is a pastiche of familiar post-apocalyptic survival narratives, though not one that too closely resembles any particular predecessor.
Even the surrogate parent-child bond that inevitably develops between Joel and Ellie transcends cliché thanks to the performances.
Equally impressive is the visual world Druckmann and Mazin import from the game.
But that moral conflict, which resonated with so many fans of the game, isn’t exactly novel in this medium.
A game that interrogates your ethics is a game that teaches you about yourself.

     The Last Of Us (HBO Show) Review - Faithful, Additive, And Excellent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The show, on the whole, is very faithful to the game.
Often, the TV series delivers a scene that is nearly a shot-for-shot replica of the game, from the dialogue to even the cadence of its delivery.
Was it beneficial to be so faithful, and thus largely predictable, to the millions who have played the game already?
For those who played the video game, familiar characters will come to life in memorable new ways.
The Last of Us on HBO never tramples over the game, but it skillfully adds its own lore.
