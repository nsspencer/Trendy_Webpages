     Golden Globes 2023: How the Show Addressed the Controversy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden Globes 2023 wasted no time in addressing the series of controversies that led to the show’s removal from NBC last year and a complete overhaul of the voting body that determines the awards.
Walking onstage to begin his opening monologue, host Jerrod Carmichael introduced himself thusly: “I’ll tell you why I’m here.
I’m here because I’m Black.”It was in February of 2021 that a Los Angeles Times report revealed that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which presents the Golden Globes, had zero Black members.
Then again, he also seemed aware of his power: “They haven’t had a Black host in 79 years, they’re going to fire the first one?
Even when thanking the Hollywood Foreign Press Association directly, none of the winners acknowledged the upheaval within the group from onstage.

     Summary: Carmichael began by shouting out "The Fabelmans" director Steven Spielberg, who is Jewish.
"(They're the) three Golden Globe awards that Tom Cruise returned" to protest the show's lack of diversity.
Seyfried's name started trending on Twitter almost immediately after, as users joked about the actress' top-secret musical project.
Angela Bassett said as she walked onstage, pulling out her phone to accept best supporting actress for "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."
"Abbott Elementary" star Quinta Brunson similarly flashed her phone to the crowd as she read her speech for best actress in a comedy series.

Later, Brunson accepted the best comedy award and thanked some of her comedy heroes in the crowd (Henry Winkler, Bob Odenkirk and Seth Rogen, the latter of whom Brunson assumed was “probably high”).

     Summary: These are the highs, lows and whoas of the 2022 Golden Globes.
And the absence of a scenario in which Moss-Bachrach yelled “Cousin!” during Jeremy Allen White’s acceptance speech for The Bear.
HIGH: A Quinta Brunson acceptance speech that won’t lead to discourse about Jimmy Kimmel.
His acceptance speech for The Banshees of Inisherin was predictably loose and banter-filled.
HIGH: A tour-de-force Jennifer Coolidge acceptance speech for her role in The White Lotus.

     ‘The Fabelmans,’ ‘The Banshees of Inisherin’ Win Big at Revamped Golden Globes (Complete Winners List)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “House of the Dragon” won best TV drama and “Abbott Elementary” received the prize for best TV comedy at the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards on Tuesday.
In a marathon telecast from the Beverly Hilton Hotel that stretched over three hours, “The Banshees of Inisherin” scored a best motion picture musical or comedy statue, while “The Fabelmans” was named the best movie drama.
“The Fabelmans,” a warm-hearted look at Steven Spielberg’s childhood, also won a directing prize for the filmmaking icon.
Several of the winners described themselves as being given golden opportunities after being cut out from or overlooked by a business that failed to appreciate their talents.
“The tide is turning and it is already clear who will win,” Zelensky said to loud applause.
