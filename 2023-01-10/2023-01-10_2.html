     David Dastmalchian Returning for ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania ’ As New Character
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The actor, who played Russian ex-con Kurt in Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) is returning for the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
However he will not be playing Kurt, and instead is stepping into a new role, a character named Veb.
Luckily for the actor, new Ant-Man director Peyton Reed knew Dastmalchian’s Dark Knight work and was a fan of Prisoners as well.
Reed kept him on the project, asking him to come back for Ant-Man and the Wasp.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania once again stars Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, and Michelle Pfeiffer, with franchise newcomers including Kathryn Newton and Jonathan Majors.

     Paul Rudd Prepares for the Fight of His Life in New ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’ Poster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That all begins in February with Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania.
The new poster has Rudd’s Scott Lang aka Ant-Man stranded in the middle of the Quantum Realm.
If he wants to get his daughter out of the Quantum Realm alive, Scott’s going to have to fight by any means necessary.
Given all the bleak imagery filled with various Ant-Men dying, Scott Lang might be the MCU’s next emotional sacrifice.
Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania releases in theaters February 17, 2023.

     Breaking down the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A new trailer for Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania gives Marvel fans a big little look at the next installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is only about a month away.
It’s not an Ant-Man trailer like any we’ve seen before, being short on jokes and long on angst, but let’s dig into those details before Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly return for the third and presumably final Ant-Man movie in February.
Of course, the only problem with this universe is that Kang the Conqueror appears to control it.
In Quantumania, he appears to be played by Corey Stoll, who portrayed the villainous Yellowjacket in 2015’s Ant-Man, where he was ultimately dispatched by being forced to shrink uncontrollably — and presumably into the Quantum Realm.
This trailer goes heavy on the foreshadowing, almost aggressively teasing Scott’s death at the end of this movie.

     'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' Trailer Reveals Kang's Villainous Temptation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We got another taste of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania on Monday, as a new trailer for the next Marvel Cinematic Universe movie landed.
However, Scott's scientist ally Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) implies that Kang isn't to be trusted, and the trailer suggests that he goes back on his word.
As shown in the previous trailer released in October, the movie will unfold as the adventurous Cassie sends a signal into the quantum realm.
That turns out to be a terrible move for Cassie, Scott, his partner Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), along with Hope's scientist parents Janet van Dyne and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas).
The preceding MCU movie Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which brought Phase 4 to an end, hit theaters in November and comes to Disney Plus on Wednesday, Feb. 1.
