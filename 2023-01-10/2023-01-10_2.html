     Golden Globes 2023: How the Show Addressed the Controversy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden Globes 2023 wasted no time in addressing the series of controversies that led to the show’s removal from NBC last year and a complete overhaul of the voting body that determines the awards.
Walking onstage to begin his opening monologue, host Jerrod Carmichael introduced himself thusly: “I’ll tell you why I’m here.
I’m here because I’m Black.”It was in February of 2021 that a Los Angeles Times report revealed that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which presents the Golden Globes, had zero Black members.
Then again, he also seemed aware of his power: “They haven’t had a Black host in 79 years, they’re going to fire the first one?
Even when thanking the Hollywood Foreign Press Association directly, none of the winners acknowledged the upheaval within the group from onstage.

     The Golden Globes 2023 Really Did Pull Off Their Comeback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet, Hollywood loves a comeback story, so the Golden Globes returned this year, determined to advertise the HFPA as a changed and enlightened organization that can still put on a glitzy, booze-soaked show.
Perhaps it was fitting that his monologue featured none of the usual riffing on various nominated films and television series.
Which is maybe a cynical strategy for this specific awards body—“Remember when it was all so fancy and easy?
The mood in the room did seem genuinely ebullient, after all the sturm und drang and existential wrestling of last year (Would celebrities ever attend the Golden Globes again?
It was an unexpectedly stirring and sincere speech from a creator who often trades in grime and nihilism.
