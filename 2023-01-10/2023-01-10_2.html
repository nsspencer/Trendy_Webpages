     Golden Globes 2023: How the Show Addressed the Controversy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden Globes 2023 wasted no time in addressing the series of controversies that led to the show’s removal from NBC last year and a complete overhaul of the voting body that determines the awards.
Walking onstage to begin his opening monologue, host Jerrod Carmichael introduced himself thusly: “I’ll tell you why I’m here.
I’m here because I’m Black.”It was in February of 2021 that a Los Angeles Times report revealed that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which presents the Golden Globes, had zero Black members.
Then again, he also seemed aware of his power: “They haven’t had a Black host in 79 years, they’re going to fire the first one?
Even when thanking the Hollywood Foreign Press Association directly, none of the winners acknowledged the upheaval within the group from onstage.

     Golden Globes 2023: Jerrod Carmichael addresses HFPA racism allegations in opening monologue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tuesday night, one year after the Golden Globes were held as a private event amid allegations of racism within the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the awards show returned to television.
The evening kicked off with host Jerrod Carmichael addressing the controversy.
"I'll tell you why I'm here," Carmichael began in his opening monologue.
In May that same year, NBC announced it would not air the Golden Globes in 2022.
"And regardless of whatever Hollywood Foreign Press Association's past may be, this is an evening where we get to celebrate," Carmichael added.

     The Messy 2023 Golden Globes Failed to Justify Its Existence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If the Golden Globes airs on a weeknight and no one watches it, does it still matter?
As previously mentioned, Fraser sat out this year’s Golden Globes even though he was nominated in Best Actor for his career-best performance in the film The Whale (he lost to Elvis’ Austin Butler).
Amy Sussman/Getty ImagesFraser told GQ in November of last year that he would not be attending this year’s Golden Globes should he be nominated for The Whale.
The 2023 Golden Globes had none of that.
So, if the Golden Globes is just going to be another boring awards show, what purpose does it serve?
