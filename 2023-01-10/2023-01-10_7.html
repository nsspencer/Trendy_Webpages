     Summary: A 5-year-old was swept away by floodwaters as California's heavy storms continueEnlarge this image toggle caption Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty ImagesA 5-year-old boy was swept away in floodwaters as another powerful storm battered California on Monday, according to local authorities.
The boy's mother was driving a truck around 7:50 a.m. near San Miguel, a central town roughly 35 miles inland from the coast.
