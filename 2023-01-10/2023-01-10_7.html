     Golden Globes 2023: Steven Spielberg wins best director for ‘The Fabelmans’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steven Spielberg won the Golden Globe for best director for “The Fabelmans,” a story based on his own early life that the director said he’d been too intimidated to take on for decades.
“I’m really, really happy about this,” he said of his third Golden Globe win out of 20 nominations.
“I’ve been hiding from this story since I was 17 years old,” Spielberg said.
But I never had the courage to take this story head on.”Years ago, though, screenwriter Tony Kushner, while working on Spielberg’s “Munich,” asked him about his early life, and why he hadn’t told that story yet.
They talked more as they collaborated on “Lincoln” and then “West Side Story.”“Nobody really knows who we are until we’re finally courageous enough to tell everybody who we are,” Spielberg said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As tears are shed and accusations thrown, the eldest Fabelman child — teenage aspiring film director Sam (Gabriel LaBelle) — glances over to the mirror.
In the mirror, Sam sees himself with his 8mm camera circling his family, finding the best angles to capture the drama.
In fact, it’s what “The Fabelmans” is about: the way that film can simultaneously distort reality and reveal truth.
Mitzi is able to pick up on the fact that her son is attempting to overcome the fear, and lends him a movie camera to film the crash.
Maybe Sam Fabelman doesn’t know exactly where to put the camera yet, but Steven Spielberg does, and he knows exactly why you keep looking.

     Summary: Afterward, legendary agent and casting director Eleanor Kilgallen told the young man, “Let me introduce you to some people,” and so Judd Hirsch got a brief tour of the place.
“There was a little guy behind a desk in a cubicle working on a movie and on his desk was a shark,” Hirsch recalls.
“I have a feeling Steven was confident that I had something in my background because I’ve never played anything like this,” Hirsch says.
His outsized performance as Uncle Boris — especially the pivotal speech he gives Sammy about art — has generated more Oscar buzz for the 87-year-old.
