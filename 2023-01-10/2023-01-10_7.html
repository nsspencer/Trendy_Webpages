     The Beau Is Afraid trailer sees Joaquin Phoenix in psychedelic misery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first trailer for Beau Is Afraid teases some tense family relationships, generational curses, kidnappings, and psychedelic imagery—in short, it looks like an Ari Aster joint.
Joaquin Phoenix stars as Beau, who sets out on a dangerous mission to see his mother, played by Patti LuPone.
Before Beau descends into true Misery, he apparently stages an escape, which is where things seem to get really surreal.
Beau Is Afraid | Official Trailer HD | A24Notably, Aster directed a short film in 2011 simply called “Beau, ” which was available on YouTube until relatively recently.
In addition to Phoenix, Lane, Ryan, and LuPone, Beau Is Afraid counts Kylie Rogers, Stephen McKinley Henderson , Hayley Squires, Michael Gandolfini, Zoe Lister-Jones, and Richard Kind in its cast.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you've been paying attention to the horror genre in the past five years, you probably know who Ari Aster is.
Now, Aster is back with a brand-new film, Beau Is Afraid—and it looks like a hell of a trip.
When the first poster for Beau Is Afraid dropped, all we knew was that Joaquin Phoenix would star in the film.
Who else had Joaquin Phoenix going full Benjamin Button on their Ari Aster movie bingo card?
In the Beau Is Afraid trailer, Aster plays tricks on our eyes, keeping us from being able to decipher any sort of linear story.

     'Beau is Afraid' trailer: Ari Aster's new movie is weirder than you imagined
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ari Aster is the master of throwing a curveball — anyone who’s seen the opening moments of Midsommar or that car ride scene in Hereditary can tell you that.
His latest film, Beau is Afraid (recently changed from original title Disappointment Blvd.)
Beau is Afraid has quite the task ahead of it.
The new poster for Beau is Afraid, showing the many different Joaquins we’ll see.
Maybe 2023 is the year that audiences are truly ready for something so abstract, and if anyone can lead the charge into Dali-esque film, it’s Ari Aster with the help of Joaquin Phoenix.

     ‘Beau Is Afraid’ Trailer, Cast, Release Date: What We Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You would think Beau would be afraid of IBS after subsisting on TV dinners and prescription medications.
But he’s got bigger problems than a “Best of Hawaii &amp; Ireland” TV dinner consisting of frozen seaweed, peas, mangos, and probably mashed potatoes and pharmaceuticals.
Beau (played by Joaquin Phoenix), lost in recollections of family vacations aboard a picture-perfect cruise ship, is on his way to see his mother.
“I’m so sorry for what your dad passed down to you, but I wanted a child,” she tells him when he’s a kid, lit by only a blood-red light.
After absconding from his rundown apartment to make the date with his mom, he encounters chaos on the streets and gets run over by some lady (Amy Ryan).
