     Stephanie McMahon resigns as WWE co-CEO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephanie McMahon has resigned as co-CEO and chairman of the board of WWE, the company announced Tuesday.
Why it matters: McMahon's resignation comes days after her father Vince McMahon announced he was appointing himself back to WWE's board to lead a potential sale process.
Nick Khan, who had been serving as co-CEO with Stephanie McMahon, was named sole CEO.
JoEllen Lyons Dillon, Jeffrey Speed, and Alan Wexler were removed from WWE's board.
The big picture: Vince McMahon, who retired last year amid a sexual misconduct scandal, is returning to lead WWE through a potential sale process as well as its next round of media rights talks.

     Stephanie McMahon resigns from WWE
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CategoriesMUST-READ LIST NEWS TICKER WWE NewsBy Jason Powell, ProWrestling.net Editor (@prowrestlingnet)Stephanie McMahon issued the following statement via social media announcing that she has resigned from WWE.
Powell’s POV: The shakeup continues at WWE following Vince McMahon forcing himself back into the leadership role.
If nothing else, it’s encouraging to see Paul Levesque still listed as the head of creative, though there’s nothing stopping Vince from reinserting himself into that position.
The Wall Street reaction to Vince teasing a sale along with his return to the company has led to a major surge in WWE stock.
