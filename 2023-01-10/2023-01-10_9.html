     Coaches Poll top 25: Georgia tops final college football rankings for 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 team in all the final college football rankings to end the 2022 season, and that includes the last top 25 Coaches Poll.
Georgia destroyed TCU, 65-7, to capture its second straight College Football Playoff National Championship in a game that was won by the widest margin of any postseason game in NCAA football history.
Here's your look at the final Coaches Poll for the 2022 college football season.
Conversely, the Trojans need to do some major overhaul to their defense before trying to make another College Football Playoff run in 2023.

     AP Top 25 Reality Check: Record churn in final college football rankings ... again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second consecutive year, a record number of teams that started the season ranked in the AP Top 25 finished unranked.
The final Associated Press college football poll presented by Regions Bank was released early Tuesday and back-to-back champ Georgia was a unanimous No.
Reality check: The Bulldogs started this season ranked third under the assumption there would be a little regression.
Reality check: Breaking in a new quarterback will cost the Buckeyes a few spots in the preseason rankings.
Reality check: The Huskies made a huge jump in 2022 and grabbed their first final top 10 ranking since 2016.

     College football rankings: Georgia, Michigan lead way-too-early top 25 ahead of 2023 season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the first year of the new Big 12, look for the Horned Frogs to have a legitimate chance at repeating.
Sure, the Tigers have won at least 10 games for 12 consecutive seasons, but missing the CFP in 2023 would mark three years in a row without a Football Four berth.
Oregon State comes off a 10-win campaign for the first time in 16 years.
Sark has recruited well, but If the Horns don't beat Oklahoma and challenge for the Big 12, there will be rumblings.
The defending Big 12 champions are peaking under Chris Klieman.

     College football rankings: ESPN's final FPI Top 25 after Georgia's national title repeat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ESPN's Football Power Index exiting the playoff finale includes changes inside the top 10 and a not-so-surprising pick for the nation's second-best team behind the Bulldogs.
Tulane cracked the FPI's final top 25 after winning a program-record 12 games with last week's 46-45 victory over USC to complete the biggest turnaround in college football history.
Projected results are based on 20,000 simulations of the rest of the season using FPI, results to date, and the remaining schedule.
