     Stephanie McMahon resigns from WWE
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CategoriesMUST-READ LIST NEWS TICKER WWE NewsBy Jason Powell, ProWrestling.net Editor (@prowrestlingnet)Stephanie McMahon issued the following statement via social media announcing that she has resigned from WWE.
Powell’s POV: The shakeup continues at WWE following Vince McMahon forcing himself back into the leadership role.
If nothing else, it’s encouraging to see Paul Levesque still listed as the head of creative, though there’s nothing stopping Vince from reinserting himself into that position.
The Wall Street reaction to Vince teasing a sale along with his return to the company has led to a major surge in WWE stock.

The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior goes on to critique and dissect Warrior from the inside out, and the next thing to target was his promos.
To frame Vince McMahon as some sort of savior in The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior is amusing to say the least.
The release of The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior had Warrior seething, and he filed a lawsuit for defamation against WWE and McMahon, to which he ultimately lost.
In his speech, while thankful to everyone in the company, Warrior made one last jab at The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior which evidently caused him distress.
