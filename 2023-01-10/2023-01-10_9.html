     Golden Globes 2023: Fashion—Live From the Red Carpet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tonight, the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards return live from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California.
Shortly before the A-listers head into the ceremony and pick up their accolades, however, they will be hitting the red carpet in their best formal wear.
The Golden Globes have a long history of delivering glamorous gowns on the step and repeat after all (though given this year’s climate, it will be interesting to see how the stars dress).
It’s the first major red carpet of awards season 2023, though stars like Yeoh have already kicked off the celebrations on a bold note (the actor wore a surreal Schiaparelli design to the Palm Springs International Film Festival just last week.)
Below, see what all your favorite stars wore to the 2023 Golden Globes—and be sure to check back in real time for live updates throughout the night.

     Golden Globes 2023: How to Watch and What to Know About the Controversy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden Globes 2023, which will be hosted by newly minted Emmy winner Jerrod Carmichael, air on Tuesday, January 10.
Their comeback from awards-show exile follows a rocky few years for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that hosts the Globes.
Now, with the announcement of the Golden Globes 2023 nominees (The Banshees of Inisherin and Everything Everywhere All at Once lead all films with eight nods and six nods, respectively), the show is hoping to reclaim some of its former shine.
Then there’s the arrival of Todd Boehly, cofounder and chairman of Eldridge Industries, the parent company of the Globes’ longtime producer.
That plan is currently awaiting approval from California’s attorney general; if approved, it would give members of the Golden Globes Assn.

     Summary: Laverne Cox Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer/FilmMagicThe 2023 Golden Globes mark a comeback.
After one year in the doghouse, during which the winners of the 2022 Golden Globes were announced on Twitter, the drunkest and stupidest award show of the season is back, finally kicking this season into high gear.
While predictions for what will win abound, and, if you know anything about the Mozart in the Jungle-loving Globes, are likely to be wrong as the Globes’ picks are mostly inscrutable, one thing we feel confident about is that the red carpet will be a glamorous affair.
So come take a look at the stars who showed up for this attempted comeback, because award shows come and go and come back again, but glamor is forever.

     Summary: (Winners were announced on Twitter, and the industry more or less pretended the Golden Globes did not exist.)
All of this is why this year’s Golden Globes feel harder to predict than ever — not just who’s going to win but who’s going to show up.
MoviesBest Motion Picture — DramaAvatar: The Way of WaterElvisThe FabelmansTárTop Gun: MaverickThis Oscar season is blessed with an abundance of big crowd-pleasing hits.
When the Drama field lacks a sure Best Picture heavyweight, the Globes like to make a splash with a slightly unexpected pick.
