     Thibaut Courtois, Real Madrid’s saviour once again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Once again, the imposing figure of Thibaut Courtois proved decisive.
Nearly eight months have passed since the Champions League final in Paris, when Courtois put in a man-of-the-match performance to help Madrid beat Liverpool.
“After the World Cup, I recovered from all my problems and now I’m at my full capacity,” Courtois said after the Supercopa semi-final against Valencia.
“Every now and then some team-mates ask to practise penalties after the training sessions and we do that,” Courtois said.
At 30, Courtois is still eager to continue adding titles to his trophy cabinet and emulate his great idol, Iker Casillas.
