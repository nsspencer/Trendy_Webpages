    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Daddy Day Care (2003)Look, there's nothing wrong with making family-friendly films.
Many actors are more than happy to make movies that their kids can see.
And, for the most part, family films are profitable at the box office.
Murphy certainly had a winning formula with most of his kid flicks, but Daddy Day Care exemplifies the commerce over art theory that seemed to drive most of his career moves in the early 2000s.
Somehow, this tepid film spawned a three-movie franchise (minus Murphy).
