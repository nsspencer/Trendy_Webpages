     Eddie Murphy brings The Slap to Golden Globes with Will Smith wisecrack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eddie Murphy made sure during Tuesday’s Golden Globe Awards that the most infamous moment in recent entertainment awards history — Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at last year’s Oscars ceremony — was not forgotten.
Accepting the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award, the popular comedian and actor thanked several producers, executives and publicists he had worked with through the years before wrapping up with a tip for up-and-coming “dreamers and artists.”“There’s a definitive blueprint that you can follow to achieve success, prosperity, longevity and peace of mind,” said Murphy, adding that he had followed it his whole career.
Advertisement“Pay your taxes, mind your business,” he said before adding with a dramatic pause, “and keep Will Smith’s wife’s name out of your f— mouth!”The quip, which was bleeped during the live NBC broadcast, was a reference to Smith slapping Rock onstage after he made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.
Smith yelled at Rock from his seat after the attack to keep his wife’s name out of his mouth.
When he appeared backstage a few moments later, Murphy said he had not spoke to Rock or Smith since the incident, “but I love both of them.”Times staff writer Michael Ordoña contributed to this report.

     Summary: Daddy Day Care (2003)Look, there's nothing wrong with making family-friendly films.
Many actors are more than happy to make movies that their kids can see.
And, for the most part, family films are profitable at the box office.
Murphy certainly had a winning formula with most of his kid flicks, but Daddy Day Care exemplifies the commerce over art theory that seemed to drive most of his career moves in the early 2000s.
Somehow, this tepid film spawned a three-movie franchise (minus Murphy).

“I want to let you know that there is a definitive blueprint that you can follow to achieve success, prosperity, longevity and peace of mind,” Murphy said at the end of his speech.
3) Keep Will Smith's wife's name out your f—ing mouth.https://t.co/YDe7QBg9R9 pic.twitter.com/1iH3iHGBiz — Variety (@Variety) January 11, 2023The joke — which, of course, references the infamous moment at last year’s Oscars when Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock for making a jab at Jada Pinkett Smith’s alopecia — resulted in rapturous, shocked laughter from the audience.
