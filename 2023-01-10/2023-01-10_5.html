    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The revelation that classified documents were kept at the Biden Penn Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a Washington, D.C., think tank, has raised questions about how the situation involving President Joe Biden compares with the classified documents seized at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home.
It's not clear whether Biden, unlike Trump, was aware of the classified documents at the office.
In September, Biden was critical of the former president' handling of classified documents in an interview with the CBC News program "60 Minutes."
"I wonder why the president asking the same questions of him as vice president taking classified documents that they were asking President Trump."
"I applaud President Biden and Attorney General Garland for their professional, nonpartisan handling of this situation," Durbin said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Archives immediately referred the matter to the DOJ, just as it did when classified documents were discovered amid Trump’s files.
But House Republicans are eager to use their freshly gained investigative powers against the Biden administration.
Initial reports also suggest that Trump possessed scores more classified documents than the number discovered at Biden’s office, an important detail prosecutors scrutinize in criminal cases involving classified documents.
House Republicans and Senate Democrats are already taking steps to probe the Biden incident, though Democrats were predictably more restrained.
Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), meanwhile, praised Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland for their handling of the situation.

     Summary: MEXICO CITY — President Biden and Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador had a bumpy start to talks on Monday when what were supposed to be some brief opening pleasantries devolved into a contentious debate over the history of U.S. support for Latin America.
Andrew Harnik / AP / AP President Biden and members of his cabinet listen as Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador speaks during a meeting at the National Palace in Mexico City.
"The United States provides more foreign aid than every other country, just about combined, in the world — to not just the hemisphere, but around the world," Biden told López Obrador.
An Oval Office meeting last summer with López Obrador also saw the leftist leader hit on some politically touchy issues, like U.S. gasoline prices.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —The Biden administration will roll out additional measures during Tuesday’s North American Leaders’ Summit in a desperate bid to keep migrants from journeying to the US southern border.
Leading up to Tuesday’s summit, administration officials underscored the need for a regional response that shares the responsibility of stemming the flow of migration among partners in the hemisphere.
“The US, Mexico, and Canada will all commit to making it possible for migrants to access our legal pathways through one platform,” the senior administration official told CNN.
“This is an experiment,” the senior administration official said, citing recently launched programs for certain nationalities seeking to come to the US.
“We do know that it’s a transit location and so the center can help people stay where they are, and apply from there,” the senior administration official said.
