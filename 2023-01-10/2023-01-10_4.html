     Bad Bunny, Blackpink and Frank Ocean to headline Coachella 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Festival promoters Goldenvoice and AEG originally booked Ocean as a headliner for 2020’s festival, which Goldenvoice Chief Executive Paul Tollett pushed back and ultimately canceled during the worst of the pandemic.
AdvertisementBad Bunny, Spotify’s most-streamed artist in 2022, will be making his second Coachella appearance, following a main stage set in 2019.
The Puerto Rican singer, rapper and actor will be the first artist from Latin America and the first Spanish-language artist to headline the festival.
While Coachella was again the most profitable music festival in America last year, 2022 was a challenging year for the festival industry more broadly.
Goldenvoice has released an additional, limited batch of tickets for both Coachella weekends, which start at $499.
