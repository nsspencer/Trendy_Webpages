     HBO Confidently Adapts Breakthrough Video Game The Last of Us
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first half of the first episode unfurls the devastating prologue to the game, introducing Joel (Pedro Pascal), an Austin-based contractor, and his brother Tommy (Gabriel Luna).
In a world with few supplies, Joel is now a smuggler, working with a woman named Tess (Anna Torv) on the fringe of society.
The Fireflies, led by a woman named Marlene (Merle Dandridge, the character's voice actor from the game), are holding a girl named Ellie (Bella Ramsey) captive.
For example, the third episode consists almost entirely of a flashback to what happened to a minor character from the game named Bill (Nick Offerman) during the outbreak and subsequent two decades.
The seventh chapter adapts the excellent expansion "Left Behind," filling in the essential back story for Ellie.

     The Last of Us Makes the Apocalypse Feel New Again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But what made The Last of Us even more immersive was how it implicates players in the lead character’s own morally dubious actions.
Yet some of the show’s best dramatic flourishes go beyond Joel and Ellie’s trek across a ruined nation.
(This season covers the events of the first game; future ones may take on the sprawling, challenging second one.)
Mazin’s skill in Chernobyl lay in how he tied together disparate story threads about the disaster without losing sight of the show’s core relationship.
This is no ordinary grab bag of jump scares and grisly kills: The Last of Us respects its genre but works to defy its creakiest tropes.

     'The Last of Us' preview: New drama bucks the game-to-screen trend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —The spotty track record of videogame adaptations and glut of apocalyptic/zombie dramas receive a welcome boost from “The Last of Us,” which proves there’s room for more of each as long as it’s this good.
A road series with mini-dramas baked into the episodes, the HBO show quickly proves itself worthy of the hype and anticipation by delivering a fully realized series graced with flesh-and-blood characters.
From that perspective the storytelling here is absolutely fearless and unflinching, creating horrifying scenarios and moments that can be alternately touching and utterly tragic.
Light escapism this is not, and the level of violence isn’t for the faint of heart.
“The Last of Us” is just the latest iteration of imagining a world gone mad, emphasizing the personal dramas that unfold against that backdrop.

     ‘The Last of Us’ Cast on Video-Game Adaptation Challenges and Why a TV Series Was Better Than a Film
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The show is based on the hit PlayStation video game that deals with the crippling effects of a zombie apocalypse that turns humans brain-dead and into fungus monsters that drastically spread the disease throughout the United States.
Though “The Last of Us” is looking to change things up, the repeated failures of video-game adaptations were on the minds of the creators and cast.
“The hardest part of getting it right is all of it, is you have to get by every little thing.
You have to get the casting right, the scripting right, the production design, the music, the editing, the visual effects.
Co-showrunner and creator of the original game, Neil Druckmann was quick to add why it was best that “The Last of Us” was better suited as a series over a film.

     'The Last of Us' Review: All Flesh, No Bones
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Twenty years after the zombie apocalypse began, Ellie is the world’s new hope, the first person to anyone’s knowledge who’s resistant to the fungal Cordyceps brain infection that caused the zombie outbreak.
The same details that can be so immersive in the game become mere window dressing for the apocalypse here.
Take the fifth episode, in which Joel and Ellie confront a cult of personality led by would-be authoritarian Kathleen (Melanie Lynskey) in Kansas City.
And the more that the characters explain and conjecture, the less substantive the creators’ ostensibly clever rewrite of the zombie apocalypse seems.
In the end, by stripping out the gameplay from a vivid genre game that’s fleshed out by cinematic and televisual tropes, the series ends up as mostly just the latter: all flesh, no bones.

     HBO's The Last Of Us Is A Safe Show That's Caught Between Big Changes, Expectations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the fact that a playthrough of The Last of Us takes about 15 hours has always made me associate it more with prestige TV than with movies.
Nowadays, a great many games have prestige TV vibes, and that really started with The Last of Us.
And now, the game that always felt like a product of the same pop culture era that gave us prestige TV such as Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones has become prestige TV.
The only big change that’s early enough for me to talk about right now is the prologue focusing on Joel’s daughter, Sarah.
AdvertisementThere are also elements—certain needle drops and other prestige TV signifiers—that the series trots out in ways that feel perfunctory or obligatory, things it’s doing not because they reflect any particular artistic impulse but just because these are the kinds of things that prestige TV does and The Last of Us wants to remind you that it is prestige TV.
