Smith finished with 169 tackles, 4.5 sacks, three interceptions, and six passes defended with the Ravens and Chicago Bears this season.
The Ravens acquired Smith at the trade deadline, sending to the Bears a 2023 second-round pick, 2023 fifth-round pick and linebacker A.J.

     Ravens, LB Roquan Smith agree to terms on five-year, $100 million contract extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following an offseason hold-in in Chicago after the linebacker didn't get extension offers he deemed worthy from the Bears, Smith promised to prove his value.
Smith led the NFL in tackles through eight games, with 83 in Chicago, and added 2.5 sacks before being dealt.
In Baltimore, Smith upgraded the Ravens' defense immensely.
Since Smith arrived, the Ravens have allowed more than 16 points twice in nine games.
The Ravens met those, making him the only inside linebacker making $20 million per season and giving him the highest fully guaranteed figure.

     Staff reactions to the Ravens signing LB Roquan Smith to richest ILB deal in NFL history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Baltimore Ravens have signed linebacker Roquan Smith to a five-year, $100 million deal with $45 million guaranteed.
The Ravens signaled they wanted Roquan Smith for the long term when they sent the Chicago Bears a second- and fifth-round pick for him.
Roquan Smith has been an impactful player from the jump, as soon as he arrived in Baltimore.
â€” Zach CanterIt always seemed more likely that the Ravens would give Roquan Smith a contract extension as opposed to letting him walk after a half-season rental.
Tactically, the Ravens defense will have less flexibility to deploy dime and quarter personnel packages that replace linebackers with better coverage safeties.

     Summary: Asked about Smith's leadership Monday, Head Coach John Harbaugh said Smith is one of the best he's seen.
He doesn't worry about what people think; he doesn't care," Harbaugh said.
That's what he's all about â€“ 100% â€“ [and] that's what I love about him.
He's one of the top guys I've ever seen that way, and I think that does always impact everybody as a leader, for sure.
In 2019, the Ravens signed cornerback Marcus Peters to an extension late in the season after acquiring him at the trade deadline.
