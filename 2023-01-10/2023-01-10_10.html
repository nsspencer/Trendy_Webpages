     College Football Rankings: Way-too-early Top 25 projections for 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 college football season has officially ended and was an eventful year, to say the least.
All of these guys should have some of the best teams in the country next season and will continue to climb up the coaching ranks.
Bennett is a former walk-on who was a Heisman finalist and Duggan began the 2022 season as TCU’s backup.
Will Dykes have the Horned Frogs back in national contention next season?
So, without further ado, here’s what I think the Top 25 could look like to begin the 2023 season.

Georgia destroyed TCU, 65-7, to capture its second straight College Football Playoff National Championship in a game that was won by the widest margin of any postseason game in NCAA football history.

Conversely, the Trojans need to do some major overhaul to their defense before trying to make another College Football Playoff run in 2023.

     AP Top 25 Reality Check: Record churn in final college football rankings ... again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the second consecutive year, a record number of teams that started the season ranked in the AP Top 25 finished unranked.
The final Associated Press college football poll presented by Regions Bank was released early Tuesday and back-to-back champ Georgia was a unanimous No.
Reality check: The Bulldogs started this season ranked third under the assumption there would be a little regression.
Reality check: Breaking in a new quarterback will cost the Buckeyes a few spots in the preseason rankings.
Reality check: The Huskies made a huge jump in 2022 and grabbed their first final top 10 ranking since 2016.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the first year of the new Big 12, look for the Horned Frogs to have a legitimate chance at repeating.
Sure, the Tigers have won at least 10 games for 12 consecutive seasons, but missing the CFP in 2023 would mark three years in a row without a Football Four berth.
Oregon State comes off a 10-win campaign for the first time in 16 years.
Sark has recruited well, but If the Horns don't beat Oklahoma and challenge for the Big 12, there will be rumblings.
The defending Big 12 champions are peaking under Chris Klieman.
