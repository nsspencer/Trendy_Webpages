     The Last of Us Makes the Apocalypse Feel New Again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But what made The Last of Us even more immersive was how it implicates players in the lead character’s own morally dubious actions.
Yet some of the show’s best dramatic flourishes go beyond Joel and Ellie’s trek across a ruined nation.
(This season covers the events of the first game; future ones may take on the sprawling, challenging second one.)
Mazin’s skill in Chernobyl lay in how he tied together disparate story threads about the disaster without losing sight of the show’s core relationship.
This is no ordinary grab bag of jump scares and grisly kills: The Last of Us respects its genre but works to defy its creakiest tropes.

     “The Last Of Us” Is Appointment TV
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Last of Us, HBO’s TV adaptation of the bestselling 2013 video game of the same name, comes out on Sunday.
Warcraft, the highest-grossing film adaptation of a video game since 2016, boasts nearly $440 million in box office revenue but didn’t even break even because of marketing and distribution costs.
Fans and critics seem to think if any adaptation could “break the video game curse,” it would be this one.
Neil Druckmann, the creator of the video game, has received widespread critical acclaim bordering on reverence for his attention to the craft of storytelling.
But for the HBO series, he’s found an ideal co-creator in Craig Mazin, who was behind Chernobyl, the Emmy-winning HBO miniseries about the nuclear disaster in 1980s Soviet Ukraine.

     The Last of Us: TV finally has the perfect video game adaptation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Last of Us came out in 2013 on the PlayStation 3 and is considered one of the best video games ever made.
In the game you play Joel – finally, some Joel representation!
So HBO has decided to remake it as a TV series (Monday, 9pm, Sky Atlantic), cutting all traces of the video game out of the story, and finally letting those who have an Xbox experience it for themselves.
And culture has a rich history of taking video games and making something somewhere between bad and underwhelming – Mortal Kombat, Tomb Raider, The Angry Birds Movie.
Game of Thrones alumni Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey play Joel and Ellie with perfect lightness of touch.

     'The Last of Us' preview: New drama bucks the game-to-screen trend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —The spotty track record of videogame adaptations and glut of apocalyptic/zombie dramas receive a welcome boost from “The Last of Us,” which proves there’s room for more of each as long as it’s this good.
A road series with mini-dramas baked into the episodes, the HBO show quickly proves itself worthy of the hype and anticipation by delivering a fully realized series graced with flesh-and-blood characters.
From that perspective the storytelling here is absolutely fearless and unflinching, creating horrifying scenarios and moments that can be alternately touching and utterly tragic.
Light escapism this is not, and the level of violence isn’t for the faint of heart.
“The Last of Us” is just the latest iteration of imagining a world gone mad, emphasizing the personal dramas that unfold against that backdrop.

COLLIDER VIDEO OF THE DAYThe LeftoversImage via HBOThe Last of Us isn't the first post-apocalyptic series that HBO has put into production.
Unlike other post-apocalyptic series, The Leftovers doesn't focus on the apocalypse itself but rather its aftereffects.
Station ElevenImage via HBOFresh off the success of The Leftovers and Chernobyl, HBO would turn to another novel: Station Eleven.
SnowpiercerImage via TNTThe Last of Us makes its debut just as fellow post-apocalyptic series Snowpiercer is wrapping up.

     ‘The Last of Us,’ From ‘Chernobyl’s’ Craig Mazin, Is a Promising, Moving Zombie Saga: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s plainly something seductive about depicting the end of the world — especially if it comes from beyond human hands.
And some 20 years after society fell, those who remain appear shell-shocked in moments, unable to believe what they lived through.
As played by Bella Ramsey (a memorable child royal on “Game of Thrones”), Ellie is a teen who’s never known anything but the post-fall world.
It’s this dynamic, and her relationship with her protector Joel (Pedro Pascal) that buoys “The Last of Us” through its run.
The raw material, including a poignant and thoughtful curiosity about what it might be like to live through catastrophe, is there.

     The Last of Us Will Invade Your Psyche
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The other lies in translating the inherently interactive experience of a game into something that feels unique to television.
This approach is deployed just often enough to add a sense of immediacy without feeling too much like a gimmick.
The hour barely accelerates the main story, but it’s so moving and focused that it feels integral to the series.
Ultimately, though, it’s the dynamic between Joel and Ellie that commands the most attention and progresses with the greatest degree of patience.
But the series reminds us why postapocalyptic stories continue to invade our psyches: They remind us of the value of being alive and how terrifying it would be to stand among the few who still are.
