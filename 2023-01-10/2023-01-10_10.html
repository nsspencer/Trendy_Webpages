     Biden 'surprised' at document discovery, says he doesn't know what was in them
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden on Tuesday said that he was “surprised” at the discovery of classified documents in a private space at a Biden-related think tank and that he did not know what was in them.
“I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there were any government records that were taken there to that office,” Biden said, speaking in Mexico City at a news conference with the leaders of Mexico and Canada.
“But I don’t know what was in the documents.
My lawyers have not suggested I ask what documents they were.”The White House has said it is cooperating with the National Archives and the Department of Justice, after confirming on Monday that Obama-era documents, including materials marked classified, were found by personal lawyers for Biden on Nov. 2 at the Penn Biden Center think tank at the University of Pennsylvania.

     Summary: “Why has President Biden, who has repeatedly kept classified materials in an unsecure location for years, never faced a raid?
The White House said it is cooperating with a Department of Justice review of the documents.
Bacon added that the revelation of classified documents in Biden’s office is “a data point saying why it needs to be done.”Beyond the new select subcommittee, the Biden documents are also helping to kick other House GOP committees into high gear.
“This discovery of classified information would put President Biden in potential violation of laws protecting national security, including the Espionage Act and Presidential Records Act,” Turner said.
So if there were classified documents, when you know, Joe Biden was vice president … that’s a huge issue,” Jordan said.

     Biden ‘surprised’ by classified documents as Hill demands more information
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Biden said on Jan. 10 that he was "surprised" to learn lawyers had found classified documents in an office he used after serving as vice president.
The classified documents, about 10 in total, were found at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, an institute in downtown Washington that Biden started after leaving the White House in 2017.
A person familiar with both inquiries said that among the Biden documents returned to the Archives were briefing materials on foreign countries.
There are key distinctions between the Justice Department’s review of the Biden documents and the agency’s ongoing criminal investigation into former president Donald Trump’s possible mishandling of classified documents.
The FBI recovered more than 300 classified documents from Mar-a-Lago last year, according to government court filings.

But as they closed Tuesday’s summit in Mexico City with a joint news conference, the leaders offered an optimistic outlook.
Still, López Obrador prodded Biden to “insist” Congress regularize undocumented Mexican migrants who work in industries where American employers are struggling mightily to find enough workers.
In addition, Canada and the U.S. accuse López Obrador of violating a free trade pact by favoring Mexico’s state-owned utility over power plants built by foreign and private investors .
Meanwhile, Trudeau and López Obrador are concerned about Biden’s efforts to boost domestic manufacturing, creating concerns that U.S. neighbors could be left behind.
