     Vince McMahon returns, only to sell WWE to Saudi Arabia : reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to numerous reports on Tuesday night, WWE chairman Vince McMahon has sold the company to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.
The company was first founded by the McMahon family in the 1950s and went public in 1999.
Earlier in the week, it was announced that McMahon was returning as WWE’s chairman following an extended leave of absence amid a fray of sexual harassment allegations and alleged coverups.
On Tuesday, McMahon’s daughter Stephanie McMahon, who was the company’s acting CEO, announced her resignation.
The reported sale was largely expected, though the buyer was not necessarily anticipated.

     Saudi Arabia may be buying WWE, Stephanie McMahon resigns as CEO: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If Vince McMahon has indeed sold WWE to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, well, that’s something every wrestling fan knew could happen for a while.
Though no deal has yet been officially confirmed or even addressed, it’s always been a distant buzz in the ether.
Rumors of a sale of the company have been louder, though, since Nick Khan came aboard (big deals are what he does).
Tuesday’s news of Stephanie McMahon resigning as co-CEO of WWE barely had time to settle before Twitter went ablaze with rumors that Vince McMahon had already completed a sale of WWE to the Saudi PIF, and the company would again go private.
(Comcast has also been seen as a frontrunner to purchase the company, given the amount it already spends on WWE content.)

     Vince McMahon’s WWE Sale Would Body Slam UFC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Vince McMahon not-quite-voluntary resigned from WWE last summer, Wall Street began suggesting World Wrestling Entertainment should be sold.
Instead, it seems McMahon is looking to force a sale—and probably place an exclamation mark on WWE’s supremacy over UFC.
Already, McMahon’s return to “maximize shareholder value” has rallied shares up 30% this year, after a superb 2022 that saw WWE stock advance 40%.
Founded in 1993 and not even half the age of WWE, UFC is now about even on two major metrics: social media followers (WWE 60.4 million; UFC 59.5 million) and revenue (for 2021: WWE $974 million; UFC roughly $1 billion*).
To be fair, by another metric, Endeavor and UFC are more valuable than WWE.

     Summary: For instance, The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior begins with a discussion on how The Warrior captivated audiences through his intensity, his strength, and his chiseled physique.
The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior goes on to critique and dissect Warrior from the inside out, and the next thing to target was his promos.
To frame Vince McMahon as some sort of savior in The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior is amusing to say the least.
The release of The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior had Warrior seething, and he filed a lawsuit for defamation against WWE and McMahon, to which he ultimately lost.
In his speech, while thankful to everyone in the company, Warrior made one last jab at The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior which evidently caused him distress.
