     Katie Porter launches Senate campaign for Feinstein’s seat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Spokespeople for Lee and Schiff told POLITICO on Tuesday that Porter’s announcement did not change their timeline for launching their own campaigns.
I’m not making any decisions for a few months.”Porter, a three-term congresswoman, is well positioned to run a powerful Senate campaign.
Porter’s announcement quickly rippled through California’s broader campaign landscape.
Former Assemblymember Scott Baugh, a Republican, said he would seek the seat in 2024 after unsuccessfully challenging Porter in 2022.
Democratic state Sen. Josh Newman does not intend to run for Porter’s seat, a representative said.

     Summary: Rep. Katie Porter attends an election night watch party in Costa Mesa, Calif., on Nov. 8, 2022.
Photo: Mindy Schauer/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty ImagesRep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) announced Tuesday that she is running for Senate in 2024.
Why it matters: Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), 89, has not said if she’s running for re-election, but Porter will put significant pressure on California’s senior senator to decide.
Porter beat a Republican challenger during the 2022 midterm elections to secure a third term in Congress.

     Summary: Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) announced on Tuesday that she will run for Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s (D-Calif.) Senate seat in 2024.
Porter has previously acknowledged that she was considering a bid for what is expected to be an open Senate seat in deep-blue California.
On Tuesday, however, Porter made clear that she’s not willing to wait for the 89-year-old Feinstein to make a formal decision.
In a video announcing her campaign, Porter said that “it’s time for new leadership in the U.S. Senate.”“California needs a warrior in Washington,” Porter said.
Of course, she’s not the only prominent California Democrat interested in Feinstein’s Senate seat.

     Rep. Katie Porter to run for Feinstein’s Senate seat in 2024
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES (AP) — Democratic Rep. Katie Porter of California said Tuesday she will seek the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a fellow Democrat and the oldest member of the chamber.
“Especially in times like these, California needs a warrior in Washington,” Porter said in a video posted on Twitter.
Feinstein won her sixth election in 2018 and has been a force for Democrats, serving for a time as chair of the intelligence and judiciary committees.
Porter’s media savvy was again on display during the recent meltdown in the U.S. House over the election of a new speaker.
As Republicans argued, Porter was seen sitting in the chamber, disinterestedly, reading a book on “the subtle art” of not caring about what’s happening.

     Progressive Rep. Katie Porter launches bid for Feinstein’s California Senate seat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —California Rep. Katie Porter announced a 2024 Senate bid on Tuesday, launching her campaign for Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s seat in what could be a bruising Democratic primary.
Porter, who studied under future Sen. Elizabeth Warren at Harvard Law School, is best known nationally for her sharp questioning in House oversight committee hearings.
She is also a leading progressive, serving as deputy chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
If Feinstein were to retire, it would likely set off a crowded scramble for the high-profile Senate seat in the country’s most populous state.
Sen. Feinstein has filed 2024 reelection paperwork with the FEC, but has faced criticism recently about her fitness for the job.
