     Coachella Announces 2023 Lineup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The year in music never really feels like it’s begun until Goldenvoice unveils the lineup for the Coachella Festival.
Coachella is America’s biggest annual music festival, and it’s the one that sets the tone for every other fest.
But this year, Coachella has been dragging its feet on announcing this year’s lineup — reportedly because of ongoing negotiations with one of its headliners — and other festivals have started announcing their own bills.
Ocean was originally announced as a headliner for the cancelled 2020 festival, and Coachella announced that Ocean would headline the 2023 festival way back in 2021.
There’s a lot to parse here; stay tuned for our annual breakdown of the Coachella poster and its merciless hierarchy of font sizes.

     Bad Bunny, BLACKPINK &amp; Frank Ocean to Headline Coachella 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The lineup for this year’s Coachella Valley Music &amp; Arts Festival was revealed on Tuesday (Jan. 10), and it features a two-weekend run topped by Bad Bunny, Frank Ocean and K-pop superstars BLACKPINK.
The 2023 edition is slated to run on two consecutive weekends, from April 14 to 16 and then again from April 21 to 23.
Also set to perform are Gorillaz, Rosalia, Bjork and many more.
Elusive singer Ocean was originally booked to perform at the 2020 pandemic-canceled edition of the festival; he made his Coachella debut on a side stage in 2012.
Last year’s edition featured headline sets from Harry Styles, Billie Eilish, The Weeknd and the reunited Swedish House Mafia following the cancellation of the event in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

     Bad Bunny, Blackpink and Frank Ocean to headline Coachella 2023

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Festival promoters Goldenvoice and AEG originally booked Ocean as a headliner for 2020’s festival, which Goldenvoice Chief Executive Paul Tollett pushed back and ultimately canceled during the worst of the pandemic.
AdvertisementBad Bunny, Spotify’s most-streamed artist in 2022, will be making his second Coachella appearance, following a main stage set in 2019.
The Puerto Rican singer, rapper and actor will be the first artist from Latin America and the first Spanish-language artist to headline the festival.
While Coachella was again the most profitable music festival in America last year, 2022 was a challenging year for the festival industry more broadly.
Tickets for both Coachella weekends, which start at $499, are sold out.
