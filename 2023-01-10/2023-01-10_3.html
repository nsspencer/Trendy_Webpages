     Summary: A 5-year-old was swept away by floodwaters as California's heavy storms continueEnlarge this image toggle caption Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty ImagesA 5-year-old boy was swept away in floodwaters as another powerful storm battered California on Monday, according to local authorities.
The boy's mother was driving a truck around 7:50 a.m. near San Miguel, a central town roughly 35 miles inland from the coast.
The mother escaped the truck with the help of bystanders, but the boy was swept downstream.
A search for the boy — which involved 17 firefighters, professional divers and a helicopter — uncovered only his shoe, the Cal Fire spokesperson confirmed.
As of Tuesday morning, more than 200,000 residents were without power after high wind speeds sent trees crashing into power lines.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The death toll from the storms that began last week climbed from 12 to 14 on Monday, after two people including a homeless person were killed by falling trees, state officials said.
Evacuation orders were issued in Santa Cruz County for about 32,000 residents living near rain-swollen rivers and creeks.
The boy had not been declared dead, said spokesperson Tony Cipolla of the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff’s Office.
County officials ordered 20 homes evacuated in the area of Orcutt after flooding and a sinkhole damaged up to 15 homes.
Much of California remains in severe to extreme drought, though the storms have helped fill depleted reservoirs.

In downtown Los Angeles, Union Station was flooded and some commuters had to pick their way through standing water while shuttles carried others.
Evacuation orders were still in place Tuesday, and all Santa Barbara County public schools remained closed, according to the county’s website.
Monday’s strong winds even led the Federal Aviation Authority to issue a temporary ground stop at Los Angeles International Airport.

     California Floods About to Get Worse as Huge Cyclone Hurtles Towards Coast

     Summary: As the latest storm to batter California begins to let off on Tuesday, leaving severe flooding and destruction in its wake, residents will be bracing for another "enormous" cyclone to slam into the Pacific coast on Wednesday, forecasters have predicted.
The series of storms prompted California Governor Gavin Newsom on Sunday to ask the White House to declare an emergency in order to support response efforts.
It expects the latest weather front to be "packing some thunderstorms" as well.
Vast swathes of California remain under flood warnings—including Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties—after Monday's rainfall.
"What California has at the moment is it has lots of moist air being brought across the Pacific by the Jetstream.
