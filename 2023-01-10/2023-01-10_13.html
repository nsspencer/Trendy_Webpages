     Cardinals have a decision to make on DeAndre Hopkins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Receiver DeAndre Hopkins has a cap number of $30.75 million for 2023, thanks to a $19.45 million salary and $11.3 million in allocations from past bonus payments.
A trade before June 1 would result in a cap charge of $22.6 million.
After June 1, the cap charge would be split between 2023 and 2024, the last year of the current contract.
Of course, with only $19.45 million due this year, Hopkins may also want a raise that reflects the current market at receiver.
They could be a way to give him more while dropping the cap number.

     Cardinals plan to trade DeAndre Hopkins in 2023 offseason: Can NY teams jump at the opportunity?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeAndre Hopkins could be the next big name on the move when the offseason begins.
According to a report from Jordan Shultz, the Cardinals will be looking to trade the All-Pro wide receiver during the 2023 off-season.
In three seasons with the Cardinals, the all-pro has totaled over 200 catches, 2,600 yards, and 17 scores.
New York JetsPlenty of teams are going to be looking to try and get DeAndre Hopkins.
It makes sense for both New York teams to swing at a top wide receiver.

     Report: Cardinals will look to trade WR DeAndre Hopkins this offseason
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per NFL Insider Jordan Schultz, they’ll be looking to deal wide receiver Deandre Hopkins in a trade this coming offseason.
Sources: #AZCardinals plan to try and trade All-Pro WR DeAndre Hopkins this offseason.
DHop has 2 yrs and $34.36M left on his contract and is likely to seek a new deal.
The Ravens lack of a second round pick, workable cap space, and long term deal for Lamar Jackson all seem to be working against their favor here.
In the parlance of Ozzie Newsome, Hopkins (as things stand) appears to be the right player, for the wrong price.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Acquiring the 4x Pro-Bowler would take the Jaguars receiving corps to new heights, but is DeAndre Hopkins really that high on Jacksonville?
Could one of those suitors very well may be the Jacksonville Jaguars?
However, Dave Burns and John Gambarado of the ‘Burns &amp; Gambo Show’ noted that the Los Angeles Chargers and Jacksonville Jaguars could be primary contenders for the wideout’s services.
The Jags because he could be, you know, with Lawrence (QB Trevor Lawrence) and Pederson (Head Coach Doug Pederson).
Additionally, the major appeal for outside talent stems from the quickly established rapport between Trevor Lawrence and the Jaguars' wide receivers.

     3 best trade destinations for Cardinals star DeAndre Hopkins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Arizona Cardinals are reportedly going to look for a trade partner in the offseason to unload star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins.
The Cardinals were a huge letdown in 2022, but they could have had a much better finish if DeAndre Hopkins was available from the get-go.
All of a sudden, the Cardinals don’t look like an ideal situation for DeAndre Hopkins.
With all that said, here are three potential landing spots for DeAndre Hopkins outside of Arizona.
Give him someone like DeAndre Hopkins and he’d be way more confident with his arm, while helping stretch the field for Chicago’s offense that became too predictable.
