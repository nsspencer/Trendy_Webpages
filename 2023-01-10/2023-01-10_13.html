    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following an offseason hold-in in Chicago after the linebacker didn't get extension offers he deemed worthy from the Bears, Smith promised to prove his value.
Smith led the NFL in tackles through eight games, with 83 in Chicago, and added 2.5 sacks before being dealt.
In Baltimore, Smith upgraded the Ravens' defense immensely.
Since Smith arrived, the Ravens have allowed more than 16 points twice in nine games.
The Ravens met those, making him the only inside linebacker making $20 million per season and giving him the highest fully guaranteed figure.

     Summary: Asked about Smith's leadership Monday, Head Coach John Harbaugh said Smith is one of the best he's seen.
He doesn't worry about what people think; he doesn't care," Harbaugh said.
That's what he's all about – 100% – [and] that's what I love about him.
He's one of the top guys I've ever seen that way, and I think that does always impact everybody as a leader, for sure.
In 2019, the Ravens signed cornerback Marcus Peters to an extension late in the season after acquiring him at the trade deadline.

     Report: Ravens, LB Roquan Smith reach $100M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Baltimore Ravens have agreed in principle with inside linebacker Roquan Smith on a five-year, $100 million contract extension, NFL Network reported Tuesday.
The deal includes $45 million fully guaranteed and would make Smith the highest-paid off-ball linebacker in NFL history at $20 million per campaign, per the report.
Smith, who was acquired in an Oct. 31 trade with Chicago, represented himself with the Ravens after failing to reach a long-term deal with the Bears.
Dating to 2016 with the Denver Broncos, outside linebacker Von Miller established a record for the "linebacker" position with a six-year, $114.5 million deal in 2016.
A long-term extension with Smith frees up the Ravens to potentially use their franchise tag on quarterback Lamar Jackson this offseason.

     Summary: Klein, to the Chicago Bears for standout inside linebacker Roquan Smith.
The Ravens wanted to see how Smith fit both on the field and in the locker room, and what kind of impact he’d make.

The ball-hawking cornerback helped transform the Ravens’ defense amid a 14-2 regular season.
Three years later, the Ravens made the same bet with Smith and won, although they paid handsomely in the process.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Baltimore Ravens have signed linebacker Roquan Smith to a five-year, $100 million deal with $45 million guaranteed.
The Ravens signaled they wanted Roquan Smith for the long term when they sent the Chicago Bears a second- and fifth-round pick for him.
Roquan Smith has been an impactful player from the jump, as soon as he arrived in Baltimore.
— Zach CanterIt always seemed more likely that the Ravens would give Roquan Smith a contract extension as opposed to letting him walk after a half-season rental.
Tactically, the Ravens defense will have less flexibility to deploy dime and quarter personnel packages that replace linebackers with better coverage safeties.
