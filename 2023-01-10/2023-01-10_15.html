On Monday evening, a storm-water basin in northern Santa Barbara County failed, sending mud and water into a residential neighborhood.
“There’s water and mud damage to the homes adjacent to that area,” Scott Safechuck, public information officer with the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, said Tuesday.
Video of a person kayaking down a flooded street in east Santa Barbara has gone viral, but emergency officials recommend against such activities.
About 100 people sought refuge Monday night in evacuation centers in Carpinteria and Santa Barbara, both run by the American Red Cross.

     Summary: Meanwhile Barsky and Gottlieb stayed in touch, and when Gottlieb was hired as UCSB’s head women’s basketball coach in 2008 she reached out to Barsky to join her staff.
In addition, Barsky is The Big West’s liaison for the NCAA Division I Council and is a member of the NCAA Women’s Basketball Oversight Committee.
Those statistics juxtaposed with the fact that nearly half of NCAA Division I athletes are women paints a startling picture of inequality.
“We are so proud and so pleased to (introduce) the first woman ever to serve as Athletics Director for the Gaucho athletics teams,” said UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang.

“The storm that we just experienced was a significant and powerful weather event, one in a series of storms that have and will continue to hit Santa Barbara County,” Brown said.

     Santa Barbara Airport Begins Phased Resumption of Operations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Santa Barbara Airport officials resumed flight operations Tuesday afternoon, including commercial air travel, after crews spent the day on recovery efforts from Monday’s major storm.
The airport was shut down at about 11 a.m. Monday due to flooding caused by the record-breaking storm, which hammered Santa Barbara County.
Runways and taxiways at the Santa Barbara Airport were flooded by Monday’s big storm, shutting down operations.
The airport was short staffed on Tuesday due to roads being closed north and south of Santa Barbara, which blocked access for workers who commute from Ventura or the North County.
Flooding is not unheard at the Santa Barbara Airport because it was built atop a slough, only a few feet above sea level, according to Hastert.
