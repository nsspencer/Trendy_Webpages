     Biden 'surprised' at document discovery, says he doesn't know what was in them
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden on Tuesday said that he was “surprised” at the discovery of classified documents in a private space at a Biden-related think tank and that he did not know what was in them.
“I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there were any government records that were taken there to that office,” Biden said, speaking in Mexico City at a news conference with the leaders of Mexico and Canada.
“But I don’t know what was in the documents.
My lawyers have not suggested I ask what documents they were.”The White House has said it is cooperating with the National Archives and the Department of Justice, after confirming on Monday that Obama-era documents, including materials marked classified, were found by personal lawyers for Biden on Nov. 2 at the Penn Biden Center think tank at the University of Pennsylvania.

     Special counsel decision looms over Biden documents probe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Attorney General Merrick Garland will eventually have to decide whether to appoint a special counsel on the Biden classified documents probe — while leaning on guidance from a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney.
Lausch's assignment is to conduct an initial facts-based investigation to better inform Garland's decision about a potential special counsel, the New York Times reports.
"People know I take classified documents, classified information seriously," Biden said, adding that he's "cooperating fully" and that his lawyers "did what they should have done" by immediately contacting the National Archives.
The big picture: Key facts distinguish the probe from special counsel Jack Smith's investigation of former President Trump's mishandling of classified documents, which resulted in a court-authorized search of Mar-a-Lago by FBI agents in August.
Zoom in: When conducting a probe into classified documents, FBI agents and investigators work with the U.S. attorney to identify the agency where the documents originated, said David Laufman, a partner at Wiggin and Dana who previously oversaw classified documents investigations at the Justice Department.

We thank you for that, sir," said López Obrador, lauding Biden as "a man with conviction" at the end of the North American Leaders' Summit.
López Obrador was there to greet Biden on the tarmac.
"This has been the only important thing, really, that has been done in terms of cooperation for development in our continent in more than half a century," said López Obrador.
"The United States provides more foreign aid than every other country, just about combined, in the world — to not just the hemisphere, but around the world," Biden told López Obrador.

     Biden ‘surprised’ government records found at old office
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden said he was surprised when informed that government records were found by his attorneys at his former office space in Washington.
The White House confirmed that the Department of Justice was reviewing “a small number of documents with classified markings” found at the office.
“I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there are any government records that were taken there to that office,” Biden said in his first comments since news of the Nov. 2, 2022, document discovery emerged Monday.
There are significant differences between the Trump and Biden situations , including the gravity of an ongoing grand jury investigation into the Mar-a-Lago matter.
CBS was first to report Monday on the discovery of the potentially classified documents.

NARA learned about these documents days before the 2022 midterm elections and did not alert the public that President Biden was potentially violating the law.

     Summary: “You, President Biden, you are the first president of the United States in a very long time that has not built even one meter of wall,” López Obrador said.
Biden, López Obrador and Trudeau committed to continue working together to reduce irregular migration, including by announcing a new website to give migrants more information about legal migration options.
“There can no longer be any question — none — in today’s interconnected world: We cannot wall ourselves off,” Biden said Tuesday, standing alongside López Obrador and Trudeau.
And Republicans say Biden is continuing to pursue lax policies that invite a flood of undocumented immigrants into the United States.
