     Cardinals have a decision to make on DeAndre Hopkins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Receiver DeAndre Hopkins has a cap number of $30.75 million for 2023, thanks to a $19.45 million salary and $11.3 million in allocations from past bonus payments.
A trade before June 1 would result in a cap charge of $22.6 million.
After June 1, the cap charge would be split between 2023 and 2024, the last year of the current contract.
Of course, with only $19.45 million due this year, Hopkins may also want a raise that reflects the current market at receiver.
They could be a way to give him more while dropping the cap number.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per NFL Insider Jordan Schultz, they’ll be looking to deal wide receiver Deandre Hopkins in a trade this coming offseason.
Sources: #AZCardinals plan to try and trade All-Pro WR DeAndre Hopkins this offseason.
DHop has 2 yrs and $34.36M left on his contract and is likely to seek a new deal.
The Ravens lack of a second round pick, workable cap space, and long term deal for Lamar Jackson all seem to be working against their favor here.
In the parlance of Ozzie Newsome, Hopkins (as things stand) appears to be the right player, for the wrong price.

     Summary: Acquiring the 4x Pro-Bowler would take the Jaguars receiving corps to new heights, but is DeAndre Hopkins really that high on Jacksonville?
Could one of those suitors very well may be the Jacksonville Jaguars?
However, Dave Burns and John Gambarado of the ‘Burns &amp; Gambo Show’ noted that the Los Angeles Chargers and Jacksonville Jaguars could be primary contenders for the wideout’s services.
The Jags because he could be, you know, with Lawrence (QB Trevor Lawrence) and Pederson (Head Coach Doug Pederson).
Additionally, the major appeal for outside talent stems from the quickly established rapport between Trevor Lawrence and the Jaguars' wide receivers.

     Best landing spots for WR DeAndre Hopkins if Cardinals trade him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The changes may not stop there, as it was reported on Tuesday that the Cardinals are going to look at trading WR DeAndre Hopkins this offseason.
If they decide they want to try and woo the aging quarterback to stay, what better way than bringing in a reliable veteran wide receiver in Hopkins?
His top wide receiver was Darnell Mooney, and the team acquired Chase Claypool at the trade deadline.
New England could give Mac Jones the best receiving option that he has had in his short career if they bring in Hopkins.
The last time the Titans picked up a veteran wide receiver, it was Robert Woods coming off an ACL injury.
