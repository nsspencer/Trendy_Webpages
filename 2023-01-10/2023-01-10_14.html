    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In an interview with Allure magazine, Stefani, 53, who is Italian American, cited the influence of Japanese culture in her home when she was growing up.
"I said, 'My God, I'm Japanese and I didn't know it,'" Stefani told Allure.
She later insisted, "I am, you know," calling herself a "super fan" of Japanese culture.
A representative for Stefani told Calaor that she had "misunderstood what Stefani was trying to convey" but declined to provide an on-the-record statement.
Even before the interview, Stefani had defended her "Harajuku" era.
