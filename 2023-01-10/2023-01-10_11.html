     Steven Spielberg Calls ‘The Fabelmans’ an Act of ‘Courage’ in Moving Golden Globes Speech
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steven Spielberg was anointed best director at Tuesday night’s Golden Globes ceremony, the ninth win of his career.
But, he revealed on stage at the Beverly Hilton, his journey to becoming Hollywood’s most successful filmmaker wasn’t always linear.
Accepting the award for his autobiographical drama “The Fabelmans,” Spielberg admitted that’s partially why he’d been hesitant to share his most personal story onscreen.
It landed a total of five Globes nods, including best screenplay, as well as best supporting actress for Michelle Williams, who portrays a fictional version of Spielberg’s mother.
“Everything I’ve done up to this point has made me ready to finally be honest about the fact that it’s not easy to be a kid,” Spielberg said.
