     Santa Barbara Airport Begins Phased Resumption of Operations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Santa Barbara Airport officials resumed flight operations Tuesday afternoon, including commercial air travel, after crews spent the day on recovery efforts from Monday’s major storm.
The airport was shut down at about 11 a.m. Monday due to flooding caused by the record-breaking storm, which hammered Santa Barbara County.
Runways and taxiways at the Santa Barbara Airport were flooded by Monday’s big storm, shutting down operations.
The airport was short staffed on Tuesday due to roads being closed north and south of Santa Barbara, which blocked access for workers who commute from Ventura or the North County.
Flooding is not unheard at the Santa Barbara Airport because it was built atop a slough, only a few feet above sea level, according to Hastert.

     Storm hits Santa Barbara and Montecito hard, bringing mass rescues, damage and the jitters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The raging storm that slammed Santa Barbara County forced a mass evacuation of Montecito and surrounding communities amid concerns about flooding and mudslides.
On Monday evening, a storm water basin meant to channel flood waters in northern Santa Barbara County failed, sending mud and water into the residential neighborhood.
“There’s water and mud damage to the homes adjacent to that area,” Scott Safechuck, public information officer with the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, said Tuesday.
Video of a person kayaking down a flooded street in east Santa Barbara has gone viral, but emergency officials do not recommend people doing that.
About 100 people sought refuge in evacuation centers in Carpenteria and Santa Barbara last night, both run by the American Red Cross.
