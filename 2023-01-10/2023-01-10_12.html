     RRR Star NTR Jr. Is Ready Anytime for the Marvel Cinematic Universe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s a breakneck energy in RRR despite its three- hour run time—and it’s an energy that Marvel Studios could use a dose of .
It’d be such a win to bring in director S.S. Rajamouli (who has an RRR sequel in the works) or recruit its leading men, NTR Jr. and Ram Charan, to be Marvel stars.
Already willing it into existence along with fans, NTR Jr. is about to manifest himself into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
“I would love to do it,” he told Variety at a recent DGA screening of RRR.

     Golden Globes: ‘RRR’ Beat Taylor Swift For Best Song—As It Should
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RRR went up against some seemingly stiff competition in the Best Song category at this year’s Golden Globes.
But if you’ve actually seen the epic film, a Telugu-language adventure of over-the-top, glorious scale, you know that “Naatu Naatu” is the most deserving winner of the bunch.
Still, honoring M. M. Keeravani’s fantastic Bollywood-style song seems like an atypical choice.
Surely the Golden Globes would want to give them a chance to give some tearful speech?
Screw the Globes—watch “Naatu Naatu” right now.

     RRR Star NTR Jr. Hopes to Join the Marvel Cinematic Universe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After impressing audiences with his performance in RRR, actor NTR Jr. is hoping to get a call from Kevin Feige.
This worldwide success could mean audiences will be seeing much more of NTR Jr. in future projects outside of India, potentially with a major role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When asked about the prospect of joining the MCU, NTR Jr. says he's "waiting" for that call, clearly putting a Marvel role on his career wish list.
D. V. V. Danayya produced.
Along with NTR Jr., the film stars Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody, and Olivia Morris.

     ‘Argentina, 1985’ Snubs ‘RRR’ for Golden Globe for Best Non-English Language Film
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The acclaimed Indian blockbuster did, however, win Best Song earlier in the evening.
In 1983, “Gandhi” won the award (when it was called Best Foreign Film), but that film was a co-production between the United Kingdom and India, in English and Hindi.
(Earlier in the evening, breakout “RRR” song “Naatu Naatu” did win the Best Song in a Motion Picture category, so celebrations are still in order.)
With their power still casting a long shadow, they lobby for a military trial where they will be judged by the army they used to command.
It was selected as the Argentine entry for both Best International Feature Film at the 95th Academy Awards and Best Ibero-American Film at the 37th Goya Awards.

     ‘RRR’ Wins Best Song at Golden Globes in Rare Hollywood Awards Triumph for Indian Film Music
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gilbert Flores for VarietyThe night before the Globes, Rajamouli, Keeravani and the film’s two leading men, Ram Charan and N.T.
In his introduction at the Chinese, Abrams called “RRR” “a film I love and a filmmaker I so admire.
“When I envisioned the ‘Naatu Naatu’ song,” said Rajamouli, “while both of them (the actors) are great dancers, I didn’t want the steps to be so complicated that people can’t do it.
And in ‘Naatu Naatu,’ this beat took another dimension and another level of BPM (beats per minute) which is very rarely heard in the West.
That omission has only increased the resolve among supporters of the film to see the film get vindicated with a nomination for best picture or best director on top of the strong shot at a best song nod.
