     Breaking down the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A new trailer for Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania gives Marvel fans a big little look at the next installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is only about a month away.
It’s not an Ant-Man trailer like any we’ve seen before, being short on jokes and long on angst, but let’s dig into those details before Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly return for the third and presumably final Ant-Man movie in February.
Of course, the only problem with this universe is that Kang the Conqueror appears to control it.
In Quantumania, he appears to be played by Corey Stoll, who portrayed the villainous Yellowjacket in 2015’s Ant-Man, where he was ultimately dispatched by being forced to shrink uncontrollably — and presumably into the Quantum Realm.
This trailer goes heavy on the foreshadowing, almost aggressively teasing Scott’s death at the end of this movie.
