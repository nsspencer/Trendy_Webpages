     Summary: López Obrador, who is known for being recalcitrant, ended their meetings with nothing but praise for Biden, particularly on issues surrounding migration across the border separating their countries.
We thank you for that, sir," said López Obrador, lauding Biden as "a man with conviction" at the end of the North American Leaders' Summit.
López Obrador was there to greet Biden on the tarmac.
"This has been the only important thing, really, that has been done in terms of cooperation for development in our continent in more than half a century," said López Obrador.
"The United States provides more foreign aid than every other country, just about combined, in the world — to not just the hemisphere, but around the world," Biden told López Obrador.

     GOP races to suggest Trump equivalency in Biden-linked classified docs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Archives immediately referred the matter to the DOJ, just as it did when classified documents were discovered amid Trump’s files.
But House Republicans are eager to use their freshly gained investigative powers against the Biden administration.
Initial reports also suggest that Trump possessed scores more classified documents than the number discovered at Biden’s office, an important detail prosecutors scrutinize in criminal cases involving classified documents.
House Republicans and Senate Democrats are already taking steps to probe the Biden incident, though Democrats were predictably more restrained.
Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), meanwhile, praised Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland for their handling of the situation.

     Summary: “Why has President Biden, who has repeatedly kept classified materials in an unsecure location for years, never faced a raid?
The White House said it is cooperating with a Department of Justice review of the documents.
Bacon added that the revelation of classified documents in Biden’s office is “a data point saying why it needs to be done.”Beyond the new select subcommittee, the Biden documents are also helping to kick other House GOP committees into high gear.
“This discovery of classified information would put President Biden in potential violation of laws protecting national security, including the Espionage Act and Presidential Records Act,” Turner said.
So if there were classified documents, when you know, Joe Biden was vice president … that’s a huge issue,” Jordan said.

     Biden ‘surprised’ by classified documents as Hill demands more information
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Biden said on Jan. 10 that he was "surprised" to learn lawyers had found classified documents in an office he used after serving as vice president.
The classified documents, about 10 in total, were found at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, an institute in downtown Washington that Biden started after leaving the White House in 2017.
A person familiar with both inquiries said that among the Biden documents returned to the Archives were briefing materials on foreign countries.
There are key distinctions between the Justice Department’s review of the Biden documents and the agency’s ongoing criminal investigation into former president Donald Trump’s possible mishandling of classified documents.
The FBI recovered more than 300 classified documents from Mar-a-Lago last year, according to government court filings.

WATCH: Biden meets Mexico’s President López Obrador for welcome ceremonyThe three-way gathering is held most years, although there was a hiatus while Trump was president.
Meanwhile, Trudeau and López Obrador are concerned about Biden’s efforts to boost domestic manufacturing, creating concerns that U.S. neighbors could be left behind.
“There’s a lot of reasons to be optimistic, especially for those of us in our countries,” Trudeau said.
However, it’s one of the keystone projects that López Obrador is racing to finish before his term ends next year.
