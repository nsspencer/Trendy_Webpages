     Stephen Curry back in lineup for Warriors after 11-game injury absence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen Curry will return and start Tuesday night for the Golden State Warriors against the Phoenix Suns, the team announced before the game.
The star point guard's minutes load will not be heavy, but coach Steve Kerr said he had no specific number in mind for how many minutes Curry will play.
Curry missed the Warriors' past 11 games because of a left shoulder subluxation.
That day, Curry participated in contact and 5-on-5 work for the first time since getting injured.
Without Curry, the Warriors have gone 6-5, not including the game against Indiana in which he was injured.

     Warriors' Stephen Curry presents Suns' Damion Lee with ring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It wasn’t just Stephen Curry who was making his return to action on Tuesday night as the Golden State Warriors hosted the Phoenix Suns at the Chase Center.
It was also a special occasion for Suns shooting guard Damion Lee, who marked his first return to his former stomping ground since taking his talents to Phoenix during the offseason.
The capacity crowd cheered on Lee as he was handed his championship ring by none other than the GOAT shooter himself, Stephen Curry.
This may be a memorable occasion for Lee, but you can be sure that Curry and the Warriors will want to mark his return with a loss for the Suns.
This should give Damion Lee more playing time, thereby allowing him to rekindle an old flame in his former stomping ground.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After an 11-game absence, Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry is back.
The Warriors did well to tread water in the absence of Curry, going 6-5 in the 11 games that he missed.
Also without Andrew Wiggins for most of that stretch, the Warriors now have him back as well.
Close to full strength, the Warriors hope they can begin to make their push back towards the top of the standings in the last half of the season.

     Steph Curry to start for Warriors; Suns' Deandre Ayton, Landry Shamet out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns will not have Deandre Ayton (ankle sprain) or Landry Shamet (hip soreness) on Tuesday when they visit the Golden State Warriors, according to The Arizona Republic’s Duane Rankin.
Meanwhile, the home team will receive a boost with All-Star Stephen Curry returning to the starting lineup from a shoulder injury, according to ESPN’s Kendra Andrews.
Ayton is dealing with a left ankle sprain suffered Sunday while shooting guard Shamet has a sore right hip and forward Torrey Craig is nursing a right ankle sprain.
Suns head coach Monty Williams on Monday announced that Payne would be re-evaluated in two weeks and Paul was day-to-day.
The Suns tip off against the Warriors on Tuesday from Chase Center at 8 p.m. on Arizona Sports 98.7, the Arizona Sports App and ArizonaSports.com.

     Stephen Curry injury update: Warriors star to return Tuesday vs. Suns after missing 11 games, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen Curry is set to make his return from a shoulder injury Tuesday night as the Golden State Warriors take on the Phoenix Suns, and the superstar guard is expected to be in the starting lineup, per ESPN.
Given Curry has missed the last 11 games, there's the potential that Curry could be on a minutes restriction, but that has yet to be decided.
Fortunately, Golden State has seemingly figured things out in Curry's absence.
Those are key developments for a Warriors team whose best units were never in question.
Even as they struggled, their starting lineup built around Curry built the best point-differential of any five-man unit in basketball at plus-132.

     Summary: Former Warriors guard Damion Lee received his championship ring in a pregame ceremony from brother-in-law Curry, then scored 22 points and grabbed seven rebounds against his former team.
He converted six free throws over the final 1:13 and went 14 of 14 from the line overall.
The Suns hadn’t scored 100 points in their previous four games.
Curry came back from an 11-game absence with a partially dislocated left shoulder to score 24 points on 8-for-22 shooting.
Thompson had 29 points with six 3-pointers — four 3s and 14 points in the first quarter alone.
