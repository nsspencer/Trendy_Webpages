     Cardinals have a decision to make on DeAndre Hopkins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Receiver DeAndre Hopkins has a cap number of $30.75 million for 2023, thanks to a $19.45 million salary and $11.3 million in allocations from past bonus payments.
A trade before June 1 would result in a cap charge of $22.6 million.
After June 1, the cap charge would be split between 2023 and 2024, the last year of the current contract.
Of course, with only $19.45 million due this year, Hopkins may also want a raise that reflects the current market at receiver.
They could be a way to give him more while dropping the cap number.

     Report: Cardinals will look to trade WR DeAndre Hopkins this offseason
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Per NFL Insider Jordan Schultz, they’ll be looking to deal wide receiver Deandre Hopkins in a trade this coming offseason.
Sources: #AZCardinals plan to try and trade All-Pro WR DeAndre Hopkins this offseason.
DHop has 2 yrs and $34.36M left on his contract and is likely to seek a new deal.
The Ravens lack of a second round pick, workable cap space, and long term deal for Lamar Jackson all seem to be working against their favor here.
In the parlance of Ozzie Newsome, Hopkins (as things stand) appears to be the right player, for the wrong price.

     Summary: The Score's Jordan Schultz reported on Tuesday that the Cardinals plan on trading wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins.
Hopkins currently has two years left on his deal and is expected to ask for a new deal according to the report.

     Best landing spots for WR DeAndre Hopkins if Cardinals trade him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The changes may not stop there, as it was reported on Tuesday that the Cardinals are going to look at trading WR DeAndre Hopkins this offseason.
If they decide they want to try and woo the aging quarterback to stay, what better way than bringing in a reliable veteran wide receiver in Hopkins?
His top wide receiver was Darnell Mooney, and the team acquired Chase Claypool at the trade deadline.
New England could give Mac Jones the best receiving option that he has had in his short career if they bring in Hopkins.
The last time the Titans picked up a veteran wide receiver, it was Robert Woods coming off an ACL injury.

     Cardinals plan to trade DeAndre Hopkins in 2023 offseason: Can NY teams jump at the opportunity?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeAndre Hopkins could be the next big name on the move when the offseason begins.
According to a report from Jordan Shultz, the Cardinals will be looking to trade the All-Pro wide receiver during the 2023 off-season.
In three seasons with the Cardinals, the all-pro has totaled over 200 catches, 2,600 yards, and 17 scores.
New York JetsPlenty of teams are going to be looking to try and get DeAndre Hopkins.
It makes sense for both New York teams to swing at a top wide receiver.

     Why Patriots Should Pursue DeAndre Hopkins Amid Trade Rumors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Patriots have been hurting for a receiver of Hopkins’ caliber in recent years.
A player like Hopkins would fill that void, even if, at 30, he’s no longer in his physical prime.
Hopkins has two years remaining on his Cardinals contract, so the Patriots wouldn’t be able to just go out and sign him this offseason.
Cap-wise, the Patriots are set to enter the 2023 league year with the fourth-most available space of any NFL team, so they’d have the room to take on Hopkins’ contract.
If the Patriots want to add a player like that — and they should — their best chance of doing so is via trade.
