     Golden Globes: House of the Dragon Wins Best Drama Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House of the Dragon just did something Game of Thrones never could.
The HBO prequel took home the Golden Globe for best drama series at Tuesday‚Äôs ceremony.
HBO has renewed the series for Season 2, but HBO boss Casey Bloys says it likely won‚Äôt return until 2024.
Game of Thrones was a darling on the award circuit throughout its eight-season run, including four Emmy wins for Outstanding Drama Series.
It wasn‚Äôt as successful at the Golden Globes (no wins for best drama series on five nominations), but Peter Dinklage did win a Globe in 2012 for best supporting actor.
