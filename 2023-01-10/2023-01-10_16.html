     Federal Agency Mulls Ban on Gas Stoves Due to Health Concerns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The federal agency will open public comment on gas cooking stoves and their hazards sometime this winter, Bloomberg News reported.
About 12 percent of childhood asthma cases can be linked to gas stove use, according to a recent study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.
“By having a gas connection, we are polluting the insides of our homes.”About 40 percent of Americans have natural gas stoves in their homes.
This includes the New York City Council, which voted in 2021 to ban natural gas hookups in some new buildings.
Natural gas distributors have said that bans on this fuel would offer little environmental benefit but would increase costs.

     Joe Biden Is Thinking About Banning Your Gas Stove
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Biden Administration is considering a ban on gas stoves.
Gas stoves are also a greenhouse gas contributor.
While gas advocates argue that gas appliance health concerns are miniscule compared to other things like cigarettes, environmental law experts tell CNN that banning gas stoves is “low-hanging fruit” in humanity’s battle with climate change.
As for the millions of gas stoves out there already, the Biden Administration has a plan for that.
For now, gas stoves are safe from federal regulation, but those arguing for a ban are now, ironically, “cooking with gas.”

     Federal agency is considering a ban on gas stoves in the US, report says: 'Hidden hazard'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal agency is reportedly considering a ban on gas stoves on the heels of rising concern about harmful indoor air pollutants emitted by the appliances.
"To be clear, CPSC isn't coming for anyone's gas stoves," Trumka tweeted late Monday.
Commission staff also continues to work with voluntary standards organizations to examine gas stove emissions and address potential hazards."
The CPSC has been considering action on gas stoves since the fall.
"Our results quantify the U.S. public health burden attributed to gas stove use and childhood asthma," researchers wrote.

     There’s a secret pollution source in 40 million homes. The U.S. may try to ban it.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some cities — including Los Angeles, Seattle and New York — have already moved to ban gas stoves in certain new homes and apartments.
Kathy Hochul (D), the governor of New York, has also proposed banning gas hookups, including for gas stoves, in new buildings in the entire state.
But gas stoves are burning natural gas, a mix of methane and other chemicals.
The American Gas Association pushed back against the recent research and on natural gas cooking and asthma.
“Any efforts to ban highly efficient natural gas stoves should raise alarm bells for the 187 million Americans who depend on this essential fuel every day,” they said in a statement.

     What the Potential Ban on Gas Stoves Means If You Have One

     Summary: The agency plans to open public comment on hazards posed by gas stoves in March, according to the agency’s yearly operating plan.
“To be clear, CPSC isn’t coming for anyone’s gas stoves,” Trumka tweeted on Monday.
Natural gas stoves are currently used in about a third of households in the U.S., or about 40 million homes.
“I think having a mandatory performance standard and warning labels on gas stoves would be huge,” she says.
More fodder in the war on gas that will hurt low-income homes and small biz.”An outright ban on gas stoves could have a particularly significant impact on Asian restaurants, which often require very hot flash frying that can only be achieved with gas stoves.
