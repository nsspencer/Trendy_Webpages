     Golden Globes: House of the Dragon Wins Best Drama Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House of the Dragon just did something Game of Thrones never could.
The HBO prequel took home the Golden Globe for best drama series at Tuesday’s ceremony.
HBO has renewed the series for Season 2, but HBO boss Casey Bloys says it likely won’t return until 2024.
Game of Thrones was a darling on the award circuit throughout its eight-season run, including four Emmy wins for Outstanding Drama Series.
It wasn’t as successful at the Golden Globes (no wins for best drama series on five nominations), but Peter Dinklage did win a Globe in 2012 for best supporting actor.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s official: “House of the Dragon” is better than parent series “Game of Thrones.” At least where the Golden Globes are concerned.
[POLL]“Severance” was Gold Derby’s pick to win Best Drama Series.
Its four bids this year were for series, actress (Staunton), supporting actor (Pryce) and supporting actress (Elizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana).
Netflix’s gritty drama about drug laundering was up for three noms: drama series, drama actress (Laura Linney as Wendy Byrde) and supporting actress (Julia Garner as Ruth Langmore).
Garner won, making her the only actor from a nominated drama series to claim a Golden Globe this year.
