     ‘The Fabelmans,’ ‘The Banshees of Inisherin’ Win Big at Revamped Golden Globes (Complete Winners List)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “House of the Dragon” won best TV drama and “Abbott Elementary” received the prize for best TV comedy at the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards on Tuesday.
In a marathon telecast from the Beverly Hilton Hotel that stretched over three hours, “The Banshees of Inisherin” scored a best motion picture musical or comedy statue, while “The Fabelmans” was named the best movie drama.
“The Fabelmans,” a warm-hearted look at Steven Spielberg’s childhood, also won a directing prize for the filmmaking icon.
Several of the winners described themselves as being given golden opportunities after being cut out from or overlooked by a business that failed to appreciate their talents.
“The tide is turning and it is already clear who will win,” Zelensky said to loud applause.
