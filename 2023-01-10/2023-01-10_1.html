     New Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania Trailer Hints Scott Lang’s Impending Death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new trailer of Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania dropped today giving us a glimpse of some Quantum adventure.
The movie is led by Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Casandra Lang(Katherine Newton), and Hope Van Dyne(Evangeline Lilly).
The trailer hints at the impending death of Scott Lang aka Ant-Man.
Since Kang will most likely not lose this fight, there is a huge possibility that Scott Lang might not come out of this alive.
Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania will release in the theatres on 17th February 2023.

     New Ant-Man 3 Trailer Finally Reveals Corey Stoll’s Big MODOK Face
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But here, MODOK seems to be working with Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who appears in a much more sinister fashion during the new trailer for the upcoming Ant-Man threequel.
We previously met a variant of Kang in the Loki TV series.
Kang seems to offer Lang a way to get those years back using his skills at time manipulation, but their relationship apparently soon sours.
We see Kang on the attack, and Lang outgunned as his family try to escape Kang’s clutches.
If you want to enjoy a little MODOK before his big screen debut, you can check out his self-titled stop-motion animated TV series on Disney+, where he is voiced by none other than Patton Oswalt.
