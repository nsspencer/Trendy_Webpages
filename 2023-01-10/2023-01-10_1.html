     Summary: “I was too young to understand the importance of it,” he tells papare.com.
He had seen teens in his neighbourhood and schools play cricket, but he was too young to be with them.
So he went to his uncle, a regular in the softball cricket circuit, where he watched grown-up men blasting the ball into the distance.

     India vs Sri Lanka 1st ODI Highlights: Dasun Shanaka scores century in defeat as IND beat SL by 67 runs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: India vs Sri Lanka 1st ODI Highlights: The only point when Sri Lanka looked like they might be able to put the the Indian target of of 374 under any kind of pressure is when Dhananjaya de Silva and Pathum Nissanka put up a 72-run partnership off 65 balls for the fourth wicket.
Sri Lanka otherwise looked toothless until Dasun Shanaka started going big guns in the last 10 overs.
While it was all too late, Shanaka managed to score a century, almost providing an example to his fellow batters for what could have happened had they stuck around.
Earlier, Virat Kohli's 45th ODI century helped India get to a score of 373/7.
India lead three-match series 1-0.

     India vs Sri Lanka 1st ODI: Rohit withdraws appeal after Shami ‘Mankads’ Dasun Shanaka in final over
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PTIGuwahati, January 10India pacer Mohammed Shami almost did a ‘Mankading’ by trying to run out Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka at the non-striker’s end but his skipper Rohit Sharma intervened and withdrew the appeal to avoid yet another controversy in the first ODI here on Tuesday.
It happened in the fourth ball of the final over of Sri Lanka’s stiff run chase of 374 when Shanaka was two runs shy of his century.
Shanaka backed up Kasun Rajitha too far and Shami ran him out from the non-striker’s end.
But Rohit came in and withdrew the appeal after a brief conversation with Shami.
But his 108 not out off 88 balls went in vain as Sri Lanka managed 306 for 8 to lose by 67 runs.

     Summary: Sri Lanka replied gamely, Pathum Nissanka Dhananjaya de Silva , and Dasun Shanaka producing half-decent innings.
And when Sri Lanka slipped to 23 for 2 then 64 for 3 against some excellent India seam bowling, the chase took on a permanently-doomed quality.
Still, Sri Lanka didn't fold cheaply - they pushed to 306 for 8 - Shanaka completing a second ODI hundred in the final over.
By the end of the fifth, Gill had raced to 25 off 17, but then Rohit took over.
Sri Lanka were 38 for 2, their required rate already more than eight an over.
