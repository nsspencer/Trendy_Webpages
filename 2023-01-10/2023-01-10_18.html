     Italian American Gwen Stefani repeatedly insists she’s ‘Japanese’

     Summary: This s–t is bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s.Gwen Stefani, who was born to an Italian American father and Irish American mother in California, claimed in a bizarre new interview that she is Japanese — despite having absolutely zero ethnic ties to the country.
“I said, ‘My God, I’m Japanese and I didn’t know it,'” she told the interviewer, who is actually Asian.
Elsewhere in the wildly problematic conversation, Stefani claimed that not only does she identify as part Asian, but she is “a little bit of an Orange County girl, a little bit of a Japanese girl, a little bit of an English girl.”Gwen Stefani stated multiple times in new interview with Allure that she’s Japanese.

The “Hollaback Girl” singer also said she’s a little bit of an “English girl.” WireImageStefani, 53, has been accused numerous times of cultural appropriation over the years.
