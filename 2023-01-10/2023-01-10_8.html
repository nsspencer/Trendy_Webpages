"Why didn't the 'Justice' Department announce the Highly Classified documents found in the Biden Office before the Election?"
Trump wrote in a post on his social media site, Truth Social.

     GOP races to suggest Trump equivalency in Biden-linked classified docs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Archives immediately referred the matter to the DOJ, just as it did when classified documents were discovered amid Trump’s files.
But House Republicans are eager to use their freshly gained investigative powers against the Biden administration.
Initial reports also suggest that Trump possessed scores more classified documents than the number discovered at Biden’s office, an important detail prosecutors scrutinize in criminal cases involving classified documents.
House Republicans and Senate Democrats are already taking steps to probe the Biden incident, though Democrats were predictably more restrained.
Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), meanwhile, praised Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland for their handling of the situation.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MEXICO CITY — President Biden and Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador had a bumpy start to talks on Monday when what were supposed to be some brief opening pleasantries devolved into a contentious debate over the history of U.S. support for Latin America.
Andrew Harnik / AP / AP President Biden and members of his cabinet listen as Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador speaks during a meeting at the National Palace in Mexico City.
"The United States provides more foreign aid than every other country, just about combined, in the world — to not just the hemisphere, but around the world," Biden told López Obrador.
An Oval Office meeting last summer with López Obrador also saw the leftist leader hit on some politically touchy issues, like U.S. gasoline prices.

     How does the Biden classified documents matter compare to Trump's?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The revelation that classified documents were kept at the Biden Penn Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a Washington, D.C., think tank, has raised questions about how the situation involving President Joe Biden compares with the classified documents seized at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home.
It's not clear whether Biden, unlike Trump, was aware of the classified documents at the office.
In September, Biden was critical of the former president' handling of classified documents in an interview with the CBC News program "60 Minutes."
"I wonder why the president asking the same questions of him as vice president taking classified documents that they were asking President Trump."
"I applaud President Biden and Attorney General Garland for their professional, nonpartisan handling of this situation," Durbin said.

The White House said it is cooperating with a Department of Justice review of the documents.
Bacon added that the revelation of classified documents in Biden’s office is “a data point saying why it needs to be done.”Beyond the new select subcommittee, the Biden documents are also helping to kick other House GOP committees into high gear.
“This discovery of classified information would put President Biden in potential violation of laws protecting national security, including the Espionage Act and Presidential Records Act,” Turner said.
So if there were classified documents, when you know, Joe Biden was vice president … that’s a huge issue,” Jordan said.

     Biden docs revelation fuels Republicans as they flex new power

     Summary: The documents, which date to when Mr. Biden was vice president, were found Nov. 2, days before the midterm elections, Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, told CBS News.
"President Biden said during the campaign that he would have the most transparent administration in America.
Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia told reporters there needs to be a "very serious investigation" and reiterated her call for Mr. Biden to be impeached.
Republicans criticizing Mr. Biden and the Justice Department have been quick to claim different standards have been set for Mr. Biden and his predecessor, citing the FBI's execution of a court-approved search warrant at Mar-a-Lago.
While the matters involving Mr. Biden and Trump both involve documents marked classified recovered after they left office, there are significant differences in the two cases.

White House downplays documentsThe White House has convened a call with top allies to explain the investigation surrounding the classified documents, hoping to quell the growing criticism and questions about the discovery.
He is now under investigation by special counsel Jack Smith for potentially mishandling classified documents.
Sen. Mark Warner, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Tuesday he expects to be briefed on the classified documents.
Members of the House Intelligence Committee sent Haines a similar request after classified documents were recovered from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.
