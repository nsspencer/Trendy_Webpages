     Summary: The revelation that classified documents were kept at the Biden Penn Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a Washington, D.C., think tank, has raised questions about how the situation involving President Joe Biden compares with the classified documents seized at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home.
It's not clear whether Biden, unlike Trump, was aware of the classified documents at the office.
In September, Biden was critical of the former president' handling of classified documents in an interview with the CBC News program "60 Minutes."
"I wonder why the president asking the same questions of him as vice president taking classified documents that they were asking President Trump."
"I applaud President Biden and Attorney General Garland for their professional, nonpartisan handling of this situation," Durbin said.

Andrew Harnik / AP / AP President Biden and members of his cabinet listen as Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador speaks during a meeting at the National Palace in Mexico City.
"The United States provides more foreign aid than every other country, just about combined, in the world — to not just the hemisphere, but around the world," Biden told López Obrador.
An Oval Office meeting last summer with López Obrador also saw the leftist leader hit on some politically touchy issues, like U.S. gasoline prices.

     Summary: “Why has President Biden, who has repeatedly kept classified materials in an unsecure location for years, never faced a raid?
The White House said it is cooperating with a Department of Justice review of the documents.
Bacon added that the revelation of classified documents in Biden’s office is “a data point saying why it needs to be done.”Beyond the new select subcommittee, the Biden documents are also helping to kick other House GOP committees into high gear.
“This discovery of classified information would put President Biden in potential violation of laws protecting national security, including the Espionage Act and Presidential Records Act,” Turner said.
So if there were classified documents, when you know, Joe Biden was vice president … that’s a huge issue,” Jordan said.

     Summary: CNN —The Biden administration rolled out additional measures during Tuesday’s North American Leaders’ Summit in a desperate bid to keep migrants from journeying to the US southern border.
And together, we’ve made enormous progress since our last summit,” Biden said.
Leading up to Tuesday’s summit, administration officials underscored the need for a regional response that shares the responsibility of stemming the flow of migration among partners in the hemisphere.
“The US, Mexico, and Canada will all commit to making it possible for migrants to access our legal pathways through one platform,” the senior administration official told CNN.
“This is an experiment,” the senior administration official said, citing recently launched programs for certain nationalities seeking to come to the US.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: White House downplays documentsThe White House has convened a call with top allies to explain the investigation surrounding the classified documents, hoping to quell the growing criticism and questions about the discovery.
The White House call did not include a rationale for why this wasn’t disclosed at the time or since November.
The White House is still determining how much they can – and choose to – say about these documents, given the investigation and sensitivity.
Sen. Mark Warner, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Tuesday he expects to be briefed on the classified documents.
Members of the House Intelligence Committee sent Haines a similar request after classified documents were recovered from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.
