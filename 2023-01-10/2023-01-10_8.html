    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steven Spielberg was anointed best director at Tuesday night’s Golden Globes ceremony, the ninth win of his career.
But, he revealed on stage at the Beverly Hilton, his journey to becoming Hollywood’s most successful filmmaker wasn’t always linear.
Accepting the award for his autobiographical drama “The Fabelmans,” Spielberg admitted that’s partially why he’d been hesitant to share his most personal story onscreen.
It landed a total of five Globes nods, including best screenplay, as well as best supporting actress for Michelle Williams, who portrays a fictional version of Spielberg’s mother.
“Everything I’ve done up to this point has made me ready to finally be honest about the fact that it’s not easy to be a kid,” Spielberg said.

“There was a little guy behind a desk in a cubicle working on a movie and on his desk was a shark,” Hirsch recalls.
“I have a feeling Steven was confident that I had something in my background because I’ve never played anything like this,” Hirsch says.
His outsized performance as Uncle Boris — especially the pivotal speech he gives Sammy about art — has generated more Oscar buzz for the 87-year-old.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As tears are shed and accusations thrown, the eldest Fabelman child — teenage aspiring film director Sam (Gabriel LaBelle) — glances over to the mirror.
In the mirror, Sam sees himself with his 8mm camera circling his family, finding the best angles to capture the drama.
In fact, it’s what “The Fabelmans” is about: the way that film can simultaneously distort reality and reveal truth.
Mitzi is able to pick up on the fact that her son is attempting to overcome the fear, and lends him a movie camera to film the crash.
Maybe Sam Fabelman doesn’t know exactly where to put the camera yet, but Steven Spielberg does, and he knows exactly why you keep looking.
