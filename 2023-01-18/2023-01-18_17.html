     Scream 6 Trailer Honors Franchise’s Most Iconic Kill with Easter Egg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And now it’s “New York, new rules” for Scream 6, as the previous film’s surviving crop of tormented teens leaves Woodsboro for the Big Apple.
Now the first full trailer confirms the next chapter will go back to the start of the slasher series.
If you were watching the trailer closely, you might’ve noticed that Scream 6 homages the franchise’s most iconic kill.
A change of scenery has drawn Ghostface(s) closer, with the trailer’s most talked-about scene being an Easter egg hunt for the Scream movies that have come before.
When trying to guide the younger survivors, Gale tells us this unknown warehouse is a “shrine” to the previous killers.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Embattled “Heroes” alum Hayden Panettiere — who played Kirby Reed in 2011’s “Scream 4″ — is using the stab series to launch a career comeback after years of personal struggles.
Hayden Panettiere is back as Kirby Reed in the sixth film of the “Scream” franchise.
The trailer ends with Gooding and Savoy’s characters, as well as Sam and Tara, spotting Ghostface on a No.
I’m not watching this without Neve Campbell.
Not including her in Scream 6 because y’all refused to pay Neve Campbell her worth is absurd,” a fan proclaimed.

     What's Your Favorite Scary Movie Trailer? 'Scream VI' Trailer Breakdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was just a year ago that the Scream franchise was reborn with the fifth entry, the simply titled Scream.
A full trailer has now been released, showing fans of the twenty-seven-year-old slasher franchise what we’re in for next.
It’s a surreal shot, as Ghostface has always used a knife and never a gun except for in the reveal scenes.
From that, we move to another stellar New York City shot, then a voiceover of Sam saying, “There’s a darkness inside of me.
The end takes us back to the teaser trailer, with the characters in a subway at what looks like Halloween.
