     Report: Warriors' Trade Deadline Plans Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having hovered around .500 for most of the season, the Golden State Warriors are in a unique spot.
Had the Warriors started this season the way they started last season, there would be very limited trade talk as the deadline approaches.
Choosing to stay put at last year's deadline, the Warriors showed immense belief in their roster, and it paid off.
In a recent report from The Athletic's Anthony Slater, it was revealed that Golden State is not expected to make a big splash at this year's trade deadline, and instead will nibble on the fringes, if anything.
"Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything."

     Summary: Celtics Celtics beat Warriors in an NBA Finals rematch 121-118 in OT Jayson Tatum and the Celtics beat the Warriors in a wild overtime win at TD Garden on Thursday.
John Tlumacki/Globe StaffBOSTON (AP) — Jayson Tatum scored 34 points with a career-high 19 rebounds, following Al Horford’s overtime 3-pointer with one of his own on Thursday night to help the Celtics pull away from Golden State in an NBA Finals rematch and beat the Warriors 121-118.
Boston scored the first four points of overtime but Draymond Green hit a pair of free throws and Curry sank a 3-pointer to give the Warriors the lead.
The Warriors won the finals in Game 6 in Boston, and then won the first rematch of the regular season on Dec. 10 in San Francisco.
Although the Celtics have come out to the best record in the NBA this season, the losses to Golden State still rankle them.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steve Kerr surprised many when the Warriors' starting lineup was announced without Looney, who played in his 156th consecutive regular-season game.
Jordan Poole, starting in place of Looney, ignited the Warriors' offense from the start.
If he's going to be placed in the starting lineup instead of being a scoring spark off the bench, Poole has to hold his own defensively.
The Warriors' starting five of Curry, Poole, Thompson, Wiggins and Green was a minus-1 overall in plus-minus when sharing the court.
The Celtics' starting five was a minus-7 in 16 minutes together.

     Summary: That’s because Steve Kerr had Jordan Poole on the floor instead of Kevon Looney, spreading the Celtics defense thin.
Poole gave Wiggins an unsure look and then decided to over-help on Marcus Smart, curling off a screen to his right.
Kerr kept his rotation condensed, playing only eight players and pushing Wiggins, Curry and Poole past 40 minutes on the front side of a back-to-back.
The Warriors’ traditional starting lineup with Looney is the second-best five-man unit in the NBA from a plus/minus perspective.

The best doppelgänger for this current Warriors season is actually two years ago.
The day of the 2021 trade deadline, they were 22-22, which is exactly their current record.
Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything.
Inherently, trade deadline rentals negatively impact the long term for a bump in the immediate.

     Summary: In other words, James Wiseman and Moses Moody, and Jonathan Kuminga, who is more solidified in the rotation at this point, are unlikely to be dealt.
From Slater:Those in the know do not expect a loud trade deadline with substantial roster shuffling, instead anticipating some nibbling on the fringes, if anything.
... [Jonathan] Kuminga, [James] Wiseman and [Moses] Moody remain likely to be with the Warriors beyond the deadline.
For these reasons, the Warriors do profile as more of a buyout team than a trade team.
It would really have to be worth it to move him, and a deal like that likely isn't out there.

     How the Warriors aren’t helping themselves on defense by helping too much
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Off of a made basket, one would think an NBA-level defense would easily cross their t’s and dot their i’s while going back on defense: What coverage is being played?
Matching up is arguably the most fundamental concept in transition defense.
If anything, it was Wiggins who was supposed to be stunting at Smart, not Poole.
Green himself explicitly mentioned a defensive ill the Warriors have been plagued with throughout this season: strong-side overhelping, or helping one pass away off of the strong-side corner.
The lack thereof has them as the 11th-ranked defense in the league when eliminating garbage time — decent, but not transcendent.

     Summary: For even in a 121-118 overtime loss at TD Garden, the Warriors proved the collective heartbeat can not only be heard but also felt.
The competitiveness out there.”Story continuesThe Warriors stayed with the Celtics for four quarters mostly because they frustrated MVP candidate Jayson Tatum – again.
It was in OT that Tatum and Brown combined to send the Warriors off the floor with a thick layer of disappointment.
But Golden State is 2-1 against contenders in Boston and Memphis, with only loss coming Thursday night in OT.
If the Warriors bring attitude and fortitude to the degree displayed in Boston, their championship will be defended with honor and self-respect.
