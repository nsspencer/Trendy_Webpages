     How Crystal Palace ended Manchester United's winning run with stoppage-time equaliser
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michael Olise scored a stunning late free-kick to halt Manchester United's winning run and help Crystal Palace rescue a 1-1 draw at Selhurst Park.
His left-footed effort curled over the wall before crashing in off the underside of the crossbar.
Luke Shaw saw an effort swerve across the face of goal before United debutant Wout Weghorst headed onto the roof of the net.
The Portugal midfielder steadied himself and then curled a shot into the back of the net, sending United in ahead at half time.
The night could only get worse for United as Olise scored a wonderful free-kick in the last minute to secure a point for Palace.

     Crystal Palace vs. Manchester United
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United were stunned by a superb late equaliser from Crystal Palace's Michael Olise to claim a 1-1 draw at Selhurst Park in the Premier League on Wednesday.
Further adding to Ten Hag's woes, Casemiro was shown a second-half yellow card to mean he will be suspended for Sunday's clash with Premier League leaders Arsenal.
Manchester United were left frustrated by Crystal Palace's late equaliser at Selhurst Park.
Ten Hag made three changes from that 2-1 win over City, among them Dutch striker Wout Weghorst replacing the injured Anthony Martial to make his Manchester United debut following his loan move from Burnley.
As the match approached its conclusion, Palace began to apply some concerted pressure on their opponents for the first time.

     Summary: How things look for Erik ten Hag's side:Well, pretty toasty and warm.
They beat Manchester City 2-1 at Old Trafford at the weekend, putting them just one point behind their city rivals.
Well, there's the slight possibililty, although it requires more of an Arsenal collapse than a Manchester United resurgence at the minute.
Nevertheless, we've seen them win every game since coming back after the World Cup, and Marcus Rashford has turned into a player remarkably similar to that one they had before.
You know the one, the Portuguese winger...
