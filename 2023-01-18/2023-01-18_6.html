     Is Carole Baskin's Husband Alive? What We Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fate of Tiger King star Carole Baskin's former husband is being debated online following the reemergence of a report suggesting he was found alive in Costa Rica.
"They said that my husband, Don Lewis, is alive and well in Costa Rica," Baskin said during the interview on ITV's This Morning.
The currently imprisoned "Tiger King" himself, Joseph "Joe Exotic" Maldonado, has made similar allegations.
A 2021 statement on Baskin's website concerning Tiger King 2 includes an image purportedly of the letter in question.
"During the filming of Tiger King, detailed efforts were made to find Don Lewis," Philips said.

Rating: About this rating UnprovenCarole Baskin, founder of Big Cat Rescue in Florida, rose to dubious fame after being featured in the Netflix series "Tiger King."
Baskin accused him and other such animal keepers of cruelty, and Maldonado formed a venomous hatred toward her.
The show also, meanwhile, painted Baskin in a negative light, and some accused Baskin of murdering her missing husband.
It's blurry, but if you zoom in on it, you can see the phrase "Don Lewis is currently alive and well in Costa Rica."

     ‘I guess Tiger King 2 wasn’t as popular’: Carole Baskin says claims her ex-husband is alive are old news
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Carole Baskin says ‘dead’ husband was found alive – but no one noticed,” the tabloid reported Wednesday.
The document, which could not be authenticated by CBS 42, claims that investigators found Lewis “alive and well” in Costa Rica.
Baskin said the renewed press coverage may be because “Tiger King 2” didn’t receive the initial attention its previous installment had garnered.
“I guess Tiger King 2 wasn’t as popular as the first one that came out just as we all went into lockdown,” she said.
Asked whether she had anything she’d wish to say to her former husband, Baskin kept it short and clear.

     Summary: Jack Donald “Don” Lewis left his home on August 18, 1997 and was never seen or heard from again.
Does a recently unearthed interview with Baskin from 2021 hold the answer to if Carole Baskin’s husband is still alive?
“They said that my husband, Don Lewis, is alive and well in Costa Rica,” Baskin said.
