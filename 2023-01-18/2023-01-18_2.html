Agreeing that home prices were previously impacted by the Fed’s raised rates, Moynihan said mortgages will slowly start returning to a "long-term trend" near 3%.
At the end of day, there's not that much aggregate demand and so rates slow it down," the CEO said.
If we didn't slow down housing, people would have this wealth effect, it would probably feel more like 2007-08."
Even Senator [Joe] Manchin [of West Virginia], I heard the clip there, we need oil, and we need to drive everybody there… We believe that oil companies have to be at the table or else it won't happen."

"It was bipartisan, and it's good to see them here," he said.
