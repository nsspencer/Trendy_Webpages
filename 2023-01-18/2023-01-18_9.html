    </h2>

     Summary: In 2022, Parton teamed up with Duncan Hines to create a line of Southern-style banana and coconut cake mixes.
Eater: Your new line of baking mixes includes a sweet cornbread mix, but cornbread can be pretty controversial in the South.
So Duncan Hines got to doing their research about whether people like sweet cornbread or the regular, and I guess the sweet won out.
Do you feel a responsibility to preserve these old-school recipes for people who didn’t grow up with a mama making good biscuits in the kitchen?
To me, it’s important to keep things like country music and Southern food in their natural form.
