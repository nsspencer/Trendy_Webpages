     Jason Kidd rips Mavericks' defense after third straight loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS -- The drastically improved defense that helped the Dallas Mavericks make a run to last season's Western Conference finals seems like a distant memory, prompting coach Jason Kidd to call out his team's poor effort on that end of the floor.
The Mavs have lost three straight, allowing at least 130 points in each game of that skid.
"If it's with this personnel, then you've got to keep asking or demanding for those guys to play defense," Kidd said when asked about potential solutions for Dallas' defensive woes.
Injuries have been a significant factor in Dallas' defensive slide.
However, key Mavericks players agreed with Kidd that the effort on the defensive end recently has been inexcusable, regardless of who is on the injured list.

     Mavericks Odds: How to bet the Dallas Mavericks vs Atlanta Hawks

     Summary: Game DetailsFixture: Atlanta Hawks at Dallas Mavericks | 2022-2023 NBA Regular SeasonDate and Time: Wednesday, January 18th, 2023; 6:30PM CSTVenue: American Airlines Center, Dallas, TXOutcome OddsSpread: Mavericks -2(-110)O/U: 233Moneyline: Mavericks -130In a recent article, Tim McMahon explored how Luka and Trae Young are linked in more ways than one and how their current situations are eerily similar.
The truth is that both teams have tried and failed to build a championship level roster around their star.
Tonight, the Mavericks are getting Dorian-Finney Smith and Josh Green back after extended absences for both.
I believe the Mavericks will win and the line is low enough that it would take a mini miracle for the Mavs to win and not cover.
If the Mavericks play drop against Trae, he should exceed 25 points with runners alone.

     Luka Doncic Says Report of Mavs Roster Influence 'Not True'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic denied pushing the front office to make changes to the current roster after Wednesday's loss to the Atlanta Hawks.
The Utah Jazz and Phoenix Suns proved incapable of finding answers to contain Doncic in the first two rounds of the Mavs' playoff run.
“Obviously, people who are next to me – who I talk to – they know that [report] is not true," Doncic said.
The Mavs have to improve defensively if they stand a chance to pull off a deep playoff run.
Christian Wood suffering a fractured thumb adds potential complication to the Mavs' short-term outlook.

Dejounte Murray posed significant problems for the Mavs' defense as he totaled 30 points on 12-18 shooting from the floor.

     Summary: According to a story from ESPN’s Tim MacMahon, Luka Doncic wants the Dallas Mavericks to be active in the trade market before the trade deadline.
Per MacMahon’s sources within the organization, Doncic “has strongly indicated he wants the Mavs to upgrade” before the NBA’s Feb. 9 trade deadline.
Let’s see what they do.” It seems that six months later, Doncic is no longer willing to wait and see what happens.
Unless Luka Doncic is otherworldly, the Mavericks struggle mightily to win.
Though it remains to be seen whether Doncic would ever request a trade one day, the fact is that he wants to win and win right now.
