     Summary: TONOPAH, AZ (3TV/CBS 5) -- Vice President Kamala Harris visited Tonopah on Thursday for a special energy infrastructure groundbreaking.
Harris addressed the administration’s efforts to create a clean energy economy.
Harris also said the new clean energy will help Americans save money.
“This electricity will be clean electricity.
On average you see clean electricity is less expensive than electricity generated from traditional sources and more transition to transmission lines means more clean energy for our communities.

     Border Czar Kamala Harris Heads to the Border—To Push Green Energy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Border czar Kamala Harris is heading to a southern border state Thursday, but don't expect her to discuss the nation's migrant crisis.
That's because Harris's first official vice-presidential visit to Arizona is to talk green energy, not the record number of migrants flooding the southern border under Harris and President Joe Biden.
Instead, she's in the Grand Canyon State to tout a wind and solar energy project.
This is not the first time the Biden administration has missed an opportunity to confront the ongoing chaos at the southern border during a trip down south.
Republican National Committee spokesman Nainoa Johsens said Harris's decision to prioritize green energy over the border shows that the Biden administration "doesn't care" about the migrant crisis.

     Kamala Harris to avoid the US-Mexico border during her Thursday visit to Arizona
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vice President and border czar Kamala Harris won't visit the border during her trip to Arizona Thursday.
The vice president will travel to Tonopah, Arizona, which is about 100 miles away from the southern border with Mexico.
"It is a lost opportunity to visit the border and bring attention to the security issues we’re facing," Giles said.
President Biden visited the southern border for the first time in his presidency this month, when he traveled to El Paso, Texas.
Southern border encounters have hit more than 200,000 each month since June, according to Customs and Border Protection.

She broke ground for the project at 3:42 p.m."The Ten West Link transmission line will stretch from Arizona to California.

     Vice President Kamala Harris eyeing Tallahassee visit Sunday to mark Roe v. Wade anniversary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TALLAHASSEE — While there's no official word yet from the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris may be visiting Tallahassee on Sunday to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade.
A senior White House official was asked specifically about a Tallahassee visit during a press briefing on Wednesday.
“She’s going to talk about choice and abortion rights,” said Barbara DeVane, who also serves as vice president of the local NOW chapter.
Florida Planned Parenthood announced Sunday on Facebook that the organization’s president and CEO, Alexis McGill Johnson, would appear at the event.
DeVane said other rallies planned for Sunday across Florida were moved to Saturday to give participants a chance to travel to Tallahassee to see the vice president.

     Vice President Kamala Harris to give speech in Florida to commemorate 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vice President Kamala Harris will headline the White House's commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade on Sunday, a bitter historical milestone for the Biden administration after the U.S. Supreme Court rolled back the national right to abortion.
Administration officials said she'll speak in Florida, where Democrats have been on guard for new efforts to restrict abortion from Republican Gov.
The speech is a continuation of Harris' focus on reproductive rights in recent months, which has included meetings with activists, healthcare providers and state lawmakers from around the country.
It's also intended to be a signal that the administration isn't giving up on abortion now that the midterm election is over.
Allen added that Harris and President Joe Biden believe "that a women's right to choose is non-negotiable."

At its simplest, the Ten West Link is a stretch of power transmission lines.

The Ten West power lines are designed to let California draw on excess power during high-demand periods.

     Harris to push abortion during Florida trip on Roe v. Wade anniversary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With few options available for ensuring abortion access, Vice President Kamala Harris will demonstrate that Democrats aren't giving up on the issue as she marks the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade on Sunday.
Administration officials said she'll speak in Florida, where Democrats have been on guard for new efforts to restrict abortion from Republican Gov.
It's also intended to be a signal that abortion remains a focus for the administration after the midterm elections.
Democrats performed better than expected, but prospects for codifying Roe v. Wade into law haven't improved, and the administration has bumped up against the limits of its legal ability to keep abortion available.
On Wednesday, Becerra recalled visiting a Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis, Missouri, on the day that Roe v. Wade was overturned.
