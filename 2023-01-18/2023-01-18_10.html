2 Rafael Nadal could miss up to six to eight weeks after an MRI revealed he sustained a grade 2 left hip flexor injury in his second-round loss to American Mackenzie McDonald at the Australian Open, it was announced Thursday.
Nadal sought treatment off the court before the third set but was unable to regain ascendency in the match, losing 6-4, 6-4, 7-5.
