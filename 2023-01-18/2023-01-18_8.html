     Summary: Crime Can Brian Walshe be convicted of murder if police don’t find his wife’s body?
FacebookThere is a significant absence in the case against Brian Walshe, who prosecutors say murdered his wife, Ana, earlier this month.
Police did, however, recover other evidence prosecutors believe will prove Walshe took his wife’s life.
“In a no body case like this, there is inherent doubt, right?
In the Walshe case, the Norfolk County District Attorney’s Office will have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant caused another person’s death.

     Brian Walshe is a ‘dumb as dirt’ alleged criminal: legal experts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alleged wife-murderer Brian Walshe is up a creek without a paddle after his Wednesday arraignment, legal experts say — and his situation will only get worse if authorities find the body of his missing spouse, Ana.
“If these allegations are true, it’s stunning how dumb as dirt this guy appears to be,” Mark Bederow, a high-profile criminal defense attorney, told The Post.
“Without the body, [the case] is not a slam-dunk case for the prosecution,” former New York prosecutor and current criminal defense attorney Duncan Levin said.
“Obviously from what we know, there is an extremely strong circumstantial case against Brian Walshe.
Ana Walshe, 39, went missing on New Year’s Day.
