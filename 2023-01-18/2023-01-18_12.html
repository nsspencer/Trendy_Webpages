     How did Only Murders in the Building – which just cast Meryl Streep – become the biggest comedy on TV?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's no shock, then, that the searingly self-referential Only Murders in the Building became such a hit when it dropped in 2021.
A video uploaded by Gomez shows the cast, including Martin, Short, Hoffman and Rudd reuniting on set with an appearance by Meryl Streep in costume announcing her surprise casting.
So how did Only Murders in the Building become the new ‘it’ TV show for prestige actors?
It's not exactly an indie darling, with cross-generational fan favourites in the shape of Gomez, Martin and Short leading the pack.
Co-created by Martin, the writing is funny, smart and fresh, hitting the zeitgeist of morbid fascination at the exact right moment.
