     John Wall vocal on ‘toxic’ James Harden situation before Rockets exit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: John Wall opened up about all his frustrations during his brief and chaotic stint with the Houston Rockets, including the messy James Harden situation at the start of his tenure with the team.
Wall was traded from the Washington Wizards to the Rockets in December 2020.
Wall, for his part, didn’t like it one bit and called it “toxic.”“I’m going there, thinking James gonna be there.
That news is all toxic.”Sure enough, it’s hard to blame John Wall for his frustration on the James Harden situation.
After all, the Harden trade basically started the rebuild of the team and their eventual tanking, which Wall also had a problem with.

     Ex-Celtic Isaiah Thomas responds to John Wall's 2017 Wizards take
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Boston Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas couldn't help but laugh at John Wall's bold statement about the 2016-17 Washington Wizards.
Wall, a five-time All-Star with Washington from 2010-19, was asked which Wizards team he played on had the best chance to win an NBA title.
Without hesitation, he chose the Wizards group that fell to Thomas and the Celtics in seven games during the Eastern Conference Semifinals.
Kevin Love and Markieff Morris, I’m taking Kevin Love, but Markieff Morris can shoot threes and post up.
I’m taking [Marcin] Gortat over Tristan Thompson, and our bench was deeper than theirs.”Thomas responded to Wall's remarks with a simple "Lol."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Richard Jefferson, a key member of those stellar mid-2010s Cavs teams, will not be outdone.
Posting on his official Twitter account, Richard Jefferson joined IT in clapping back towards John Wall’s statements, using cold hard facts to shut down Wall’s adamant assertions.
RJ is right – there was just no stopping LeBron James and the Cavs in the Eastern Conference, especially during those two years he mentioned.
It even took one of the worst postseason games of James’ career for the Celtics to deal the Cavs their first loss of the 2017 postseason.
Richard Jefferson knows it.

     John Wall blasts Rockets' team culture, levies tanking allegation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Current Los Angeles Clippers guard John Wall didn't hold back when discussing his time in Houston when appearing on the Run Your Race podcast.
Such plans didn't exactly come to fruition.
Harden skipped Rockets' training camp as he demanded a trade, and he was off the roster less than two month's later.
Wall didn't play in 2021-22, then was waived by the Rockets in June 2022.
With or without Wall, Houston hasn't been able to establish a winning culture in recent seasons.

     Tyler Hansbrough denies dismissing John Wall on recruiting visit to North Carolina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Kentucky superstar John Wall has accused North Carolina legend Tyler Hansbrough of dismissing him on a recruiting visit, but Hansbrough has since refuted that version of events.
Wall said North Carolina was his dream school, but the recruiting visit swayed his mind toward Kentucky.
While it may sound like Hansbrough fumbled the Tar Heels' opportunity to land Wall, Hansbrough went on Twitter to deny that he ever shrugged Wall off on a recruiting visit.
Wall went to Kentucky as the No.
In 142 games with North Carolina, Hansbrough averaged 20.2 points, 8.6 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game.

     John Wall claims Tar Heels legend kept him from playing at UNC over Kentucky
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He was a much-hyped high school recruit who ended up with John Calipari at the Kentucky Wildcats before being selected by the Washington Wizards with the first overall pick.
As he said in an appearance on former North Carolina Tar Heels starter Theo Pinson’s Run Your Race podcast, his dream was to play for UNC.
That thing was apparently one of the greatest Tar Heels ever: Tyler Hansbrough.
John Wall claims Tyler Hansbrough is why he chose Kentucky over UNCWall claims that the only thing that could’ve kept him from Calipari and Kentucky was North Carolina wanting him.
… I’m like, ‘I need to meet Ty Lawson and Tyler Hansbrough, this is a dream come true for me.’ School I loved growing up.
