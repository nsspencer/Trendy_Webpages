     'Barry' reloads for its crackling third season without missing a beat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Barreling forward without much apparent thought to its own longevity, "Barry" returns without missing a beat, fearlessly racing through story with a mix of darkly comic violence and drop-dead-funny visual gags.
Delving deeper into Hollywood's quirks and its title character's double life, the crackling third season continues to operate like a high-wire act without a net.
After a shocking end to season two almost three years ago, Barry finds himself suspected of murder (correctly) by his former acting coach, Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler, again sensational), creating a serious dilemma for the title character given his soft spot for the guy.
Barry's girlfriend Sally (Sarah Goldberg), meanwhile, is enjoying unexpected success, having created and starring in her own TV show, though the gig brings with it considerable pressure and major hassles, from network interference to a co-star concerned about Sally and Barry's relationship.
Finally, there's Barry's other world, the one occupied by colorful personalities like his former handler Fuches (Stephen Root), as amoral a biped as ever walked, and Chechen mobster Noho Hank (Anthony Carrigan), who is carrying on a secret relationship that seriously complicates his life.

     Summary: When we catch up with Barry, we find that he’s living with Sally, but he’s no more than a prop in their home.
With Sally, it appears her worst behaviors are learned behaviors that she’s picking up elsewhere.
Meanwhile, No-Ho Hank is forced to answer for Barry’s massacre at the monastery last season and the Chechen pin found near Moss’ body that Barry planted.
The police inform him that the man is a Chechen known as The Raven, but Cousineau remains steadfast about Barry’ involvement.
The police reassure Gene that Barry has been cleared as a suspect, but the old man won’t let it go.

     Barry keeps killing it, and that’s the problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Partway through the third season of Barry, which premieres on HBO this weekend, the show returns to this moment.
Perhaps this is why in its third season, Barry begins to zero in on the multitude of ways a person can be violent.
It makes sense that Barry is so careful to convey this, because Barry also is a very good show about actors.
And so, as Barry has wondered since season 1, what’s the difference between performing good and being good?
Six episodes into Barry’s third season, Barry is discovering that even with his considerable skills and growing performance acumen, there is precious little that will help him bridge that gap.

The opening’s a pitch-black joke, but also a big season statement: Barry may be addicted to murder, doing it out of boredom or irritation.
After a fantastically tense scene between Barry and his former mentor, Gene levels the gun at Barry under the desk.
Or will Barry, unable to forgive himself, in the quest to earn forgiveness, make things even worse?

It wouldn’t be accurate to call cold-blooded murder a “comfort” to Barry; he’s known since before the first episode that killing isn’t exactly self-care.
And only moments later, when the client decides to renege and forgive Jeff after all, Barry can’t even be bothered to listen to the guy’s full explanation.
Sally can’t see what her boyfriend is going through because she’s too distracted living her dream.
Last season, Sally strove for authenticity in telling the story of her own abuse.
