    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Report: Tottenham could make 45-cap assist specialist with 'outstanding qualities' their first summer signingTottenham are keeping tabs on Eintracht Frankfurt wing-back Filip Kostic ahead of a potential transfer this summer, according to The Independent’s Miguel Delaney.
Writing for his weekly Reading The Game column, Delaney named Kostic as one of a number of players Tottenham are keen on signing this summer.
Kostic has won 45 caps for his country, too, and is seen as a viable alternative to the likes of Ryan Sessegnon and Sergio Reguilon at left wing-back for Spurs.
But in terms of attacking play, Kostic is right up there.
Kostic will be entering the final year of his contract this summer and that could mean the door is open for Spurs here.

     Summary: Photo by Craig Mercer/MB Media/Getty ImagesTottenham Hotspur have been heavily linked with re-signing Christian Eriksen – and he has praised both Son Heung-min and Harry Kane.
Tottenham took on Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday evening, playing out a 0-0 draw in West London.
Photo by VisionhausAfter the game against Tottenham, Eriksen told Sky Sports that he felt Spurs played as he expected on Saturday.
Eriksen added that both Son and Kane are ‘exceptional’ players so Brentford had to deal with both of them well.
Eriksen used to be a key part of the Tottenham side with Son and Kane, and we could yet see it again with Spurs chasing a deal.

     Summary: Bringing in a backup striker is a “main priority” for Antonio Conte at Tottenham this summer, according to journalist Pete O’Rourke.
1 of 8 Do you know this obscure player Tottenham signed in the January transfer window?
According to the Telegraph, Conte wants to sign six players when the transfer window reopens for business, and O’Rourke reckons that one of those must be a striker.
They didn’t bring one in the summer to provide cover for Kane and Son, so a striker is definitely a main priority.”Chelsea 2-4 Arsenal!

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over the past two weeks, the wing-backs have become full-backs, basically switching Spurs to a back five.
Every time he dropped deep to find the ball, three Brentford players crowded him out to make sure he couldn’t find a pass.
Conte’s lack of subs – It has been clear in the past couple of games that Conte is not totally satisfied with his bench options.
0-0 late on against Brighton and Brentford, he seems to leave his substitutions extremely late.
It seems as though there will be a big summer ahead with Conte bringing in new faces that suit his system.

Arsenal favorite after winning weekWith five matches left of the season, Arsenal is now favorite for that final Champions League place.
With injuries and suspensions, West Ham could have four center-backs unavailable for the Arsenal match.
It is fair to say West Ham will likely prioritize the European matches over the league clash with Arsenal.
Not easy fixtures, but after the past week these are matches Arsenal will be confident of winning, or at least not losing.
