     Brandon Ingram's playoff tear continues with 30 points in Game 4 to help New Orleans Pelicans tie series with Phoenix Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW ORLEANS -- Pelicans forward Brandon Ingram is four games into the first playoff appearance of his six-year career -- a fact his rookie teammate Jose Alvarado still can't believe.
It was another standout performance for Ingram, who finished with 30 points as the Pelicans defeated the top-seeded Phoenix Suns 118-103 to tie their Western Conference first-round playoff series at 2-2.
Also, Ingram's 119 points across his first four playoff games are the fifth most by any player since the merger, behind only James (137), Anthony Davis (126), Luka Doncic (126) and Ja Morant (124).
Like he did in Game 2, during the Pelicans' other win in the series, Ingram started out with 11 first-quarter points.
For the series, the Pelicans have outscored the Suns in the third quarter 137-93.
