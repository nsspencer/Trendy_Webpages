     Christian Pulisic goal video: Chelsea star scores vs West Ham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christian Pulisic has scored his first goal for Chelsea in more than a month, and it couldn’t have come at a better time for the club.
In the 90th minute of a scoreless match with West Ham, Marcos Alonso’s low cross into the box split four defenders before finding Pulisic.
Chelsea benefitted from a Craig Dawson red card after the West Ham defender brought down Romelu Lukaku with a clear chance on goal in the 86th minute.
But Chelsea’s Jorginho saw his weak penalty saved by West Ham keeper Łukasz Fabiański with just minutes remaining.
The American winger has only logged 71 Premier League minutes since, but he made his 14 minutes count Sunday.

     Summary: Chelsea tightened their grip on third place in the Premier League with a 1-0 victory over 10-man West Ham United on Sunday, with Christian Pulisic's 90th-minute winner at Stamford Bridge making up for teammate Jorginho's missed penalty.
Substitute Pulisic arrived in the box at the right time to guide home a superb pass by Marcos Alonso shortly after Jorginho had wasted his chance from the spot, firing straight at West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.
Clive Rose/Getty ImagesSeventh-placed West Ham made six changes to their starting line-up with an eye on Thursday's Europa League semi-final first leg against Eintracht Frankfurt, a competition that offers them their best chance of reaching next season's Champions League.
With the victory, Chelsea move five points clear of fourth-placed Arsenal, with a match in hand against Mikel Arteta's side.
They can consolidate their position with a victory over struggling Manchester United on Thursday.

     How Chelsea beat West Ham 1-0: Live updates from the Premier League after late Pulisic winner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christian Pulisic’s late goal ensured Chelsea strengthened their grip on third place in the Premier League with a 1-0 win against West Ham.
Pulisic was then able to make the telling difference after being introduced from the bench as he swept Marcos Alonso’s low cross into the bottom corner.
It was a crushing blow for the visitors who, despite making wholesale changes, put up a great fight and defending resolutely throughout.
Meanwhile, Thomas Tuchel won’t have been particularly impressed by his team’s performance but will be happy that they were able to take all three points.
The result restores Chelsea’s five-point cushion to fourth-placed Arsenal while it leaves West Ham seventh, putting a major dent in their ambitions of finishing in a European qualification place.
