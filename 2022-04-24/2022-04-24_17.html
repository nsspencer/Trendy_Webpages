     Summary: In "Grace and Frankie," Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin are two feisty octogenarians who see old age not as a death sentence, but as a victory lap.
Tomlin and Fonda actually are great friends in real life, but they're not exactly like the women the play.
And when I left the theater that night I said to myself, 'I'm not making a movie about secretaries unless Lily Tomlin is in it.'"
Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda, stars of the Netflix series, "Grace and Frankie."
Truth is, what makes Jane and Lily (and "Grace and Frankie") work is that, fake joints and all, they seem so very real.
