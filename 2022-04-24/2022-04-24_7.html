     Outlander Season 6 Episode 7 Recap: Sticks and Stones
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Many of the Ridge residents believe Claire killed Malva because of jealousy and or witchcraft.
Roger agrees to officiate Malva’s funeral but he’s also feeling doubts about whether he is the right person to do it.
Everyone interprets his anger like that of a grieving brother, and Jamie and Claire realize they should leave in order to deescalate the situation.
The episode avoids answering the question of Josiah and Keziah feeling attraction for each other but Lizzie’s description points toward Lizzie having two lovers.
Jamie’s plan doesn’t quite work out, as Lizzie later asks Roger to perform the handfast ceremony with Josiah.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How is it possible that we’ve already reached the penultimate episode of Outlander‘s sixth season?
In the present, Tom Christie (Mark Lewis Jones) and Allan (Alexander Vlahos) arrive at Fraser’s Ridge after learning what’s become of Malva.
Of course, Claire already blames herself.
The B-plot for this episode involves our dear sweet Lizzie (Caitlyn O’Ryan), who seems to be going missing quite a lot.
It’s Keziah who gets lucky, and Jamie performs a handfast ceremony and orders Josiah to leave until the baby’s born.

     The men who (secretly) love ‘Outlander’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Long touted, and sometimes marketed, as a show that appeals mainly to women, the Starz hit “Outlander” actually has a strong – if bashful – male fan base.
John Nicholson, a Scottish telecommunications and IT professional who co-administers a large Facebook fan group, knows of many men who love “Outlander” but “feel embarrassed” about admitting it.
I wish we had more men in the group,” he told me via Facebook.
