    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Many of the Ridge residents believe Claire killed Malva because of jealousy and or witchcraft.
Roger agrees to officiate Malva’s funeral but he’s also feeling doubts about whether he is the right person to do it.
Everyone interprets his anger like that of a grieving brother, and Jamie and Claire realize they should leave in order to deescalate the situation.
The episode avoids answering the question of Josiah and Keziah feeling attraction for each other but Lizzie’s description points toward Lizzie having two lovers.
Jamie’s plan doesn’t quite work out, as Lizzie later asks Roger to perform the handfast ceremony with Josiah.

Herself is in a verra bad way, shaking and hearing both Malva and Lionel Brown taunting her.

     Summary: Outlander Sticks and Stones Season 6 Episode 7 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Robert Wilson/StarzWhen it rains, it pours on Fraser’s Ridge, and by that, I mean just as Claire and Jamie are dealing with Malva’s grisly murder, of which Claire is Suspect No.
I have a serious question, though: Is Lizzie supposed to be an idiot?
That’s especially true of Claire and Jamie, who have much bigger problems than the Ridge’s resident throuple.
This will all certainly come into play by the end of the season.
And while she’s supposed to be talking about Jamie here, doesn’t it sound like there could be a whole list of suspects that fit this description?
