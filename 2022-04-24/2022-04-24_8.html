     Summary: Bringing in a backup striker is a “main priority” for Antonio Conte at Tottenham this summer, according to journalist Pete O’Rourke.

According to the Telegraph, Conte wants to sign six players when the transfer window reopens for business, and O’Rourke reckons that one of those must be a striker.
They didn’t bring one in the summer to provide cover for Kane and Son, so a striker is definitely a main priority.”Chelsea 2-4 Arsenal!

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over the past two weeks, the wing-backs have become full-backs, basically switching Spurs to a back five.
Every time he dropped deep to find the ball, three Brentford players crowded him out to make sure he couldn’t find a pass.
Conte’s lack of subs – It has been clear in the past couple of games that Conte is not totally satisfied with his bench options.
0-0 late on against Brighton and Brentford, he seems to leave his substitutions extremely late.
It seems as though there will be a big summer ahead with Conte bringing in new faces that suit his system.

Arsenal favorite after winning weekWith five matches left of the season, Arsenal is now favorite for that final Champions League place.
With injuries and suspensions, West Ham could have four center-backs unavailable for the Arsenal match.
It is fair to say West Ham will likely prioritize the European matches over the league clash with Arsenal.
Not easy fixtures, but after the past week these are matches Arsenal will be confident of winning, or at least not losing.
