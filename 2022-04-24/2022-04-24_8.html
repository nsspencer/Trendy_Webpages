     Barry Season 3 Episode 1 Review: Forgiving Jeff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When we catch up with Barry, we find that he’s living with Sally, but he’s no more than a prop in their home.
With Sally, it appears her worst behaviors are learned behaviors that she’s picking up elsewhere.
Meanwhile, No-Ho Hank is forced to answer for Barry’s massacre at the monastery last season and the Chechen pin found near Moss’ body that Barry planted.
The police inform him that the man is a Chechen known as The Raven, but Cousineau remains steadfast about Barry’ involvement.
The police reassure Gene that Barry has been cleared as a suspect, but the old man won’t let it go.

     Barry Premiere Recap: Hit and Miss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Our favorite hitman is in pretty rough shape as Barry kicks off its third season — and things are about to get rougher.
Sunday’s premiere finds Barry standing in an open field and eating a snack while we hear a guy pleading for his life.
Gene sits stone-faced as Barry arrives at the theater, walking past a sign that reveals it’s closing after 15 years.
When Barry asks if Gene might try acting again, Gene fires back: “My career is s–t, Barry.
So Barry takes Gene to that same open field, holding a gun on him as he swears not to tell a soul.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is the question hanging over “Barry” when it returns Sunday after a three-year hiatus — and several dead bodies in between seasons.
Series creators and writers Hader and Alec Berg have always infused “Barry” with psychological depth, but in Season 3, the stoic, seemingly emotionless Barry is ready to blow.
His former mentor and partner-in-crime Monroe Fuches (Stephen Root) knows the real Barry, as does Chechen mobster/underworld butterfly NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan).

     'Barry' season 3 review: Bill Hader reloads for the HBO show's crackling third season without missing a beat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Delving deeper into Hollywood’s quirks and its title character’s double life, the crackling third season continues to operate like a high-wire act without a net.
Both Hader and Winkler have earned well-deserved Emmys for the show, but the cast is first-rate from top to bottom.
Instead, “The Baby” toddles along, adding a perverse spin to the notion that a kid can ruin someone’s life.
Season 3 of “Barry” and “The Baby” premiere at 10 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
ET on April 24 on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

     What to Remember About Barry Before Season 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: HBOIt feels like it’s been a literal lifetime since Barry’s second season ended in May 2019 — pre-pandemic, pre-insurrection, basically pre-everything.
Barry Berkman Killed Janice MossYes, this happened at the end of season one, but much of the action related to that incident drives the narrative of season three.
Near the end of the season, Fuches (Stephen Root), furious at Barry, finds Janice’s car buried in the woods near Gene’s cabin with her body in the trunk.
In season two, Detective John Loach (John Pirruccello) led the search for his missing partner, pushing Fuches to try and get Barry to confess.
Barry’s TraumaIn season two, Gene’s acting class taught its students to dig into their own backgrounds to find truth onstage.

Reviews Barry Reviews Barry “forgiving jeff” A A “forgiving jeff” SEASON 3 EPISODE 1Never before has Barry slayed out of anything but duty or rage.
The opening’s a pitch-black joke, but also a big season statement: Barry may be addicted to murder, doing it out of boredom or irritation.
After a fantastically tense scene between Barry and his former mentor, Gene levels the gun at Barry under the desk.
Or will Barry, unable to forgive himself, in the quest to earn forgiveness, make things even worse?

     ‘Barry’ Star Henry Winkler Thinks His Character Could ‘Definitely’ Commit Murder
    </h2>

     Summary: SPOILER ALERT:Do not read if you haven’t watched “Forgiving Jeff,” the Season 3 premiere of “Barry,” now streaming on HBO Max.
After the police ignore his report, Cousineau confronts Barry at the climax of the episode, intending to force him to confess his crime to the cops.
But the confrontation quickly falls apart, and Cousineau winds up with a gun pointed at him by Barry, begging for his life.
“Barry” ended its second season with that cliffhanger ending, and then thanks to COVID, production got delayed for a long time.
I feel like over the seasons he’s really grown as a person.
