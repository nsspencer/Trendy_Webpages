     Happy Birthday, Barbra Streisand! Her Life in 27 Gorgeous Old Pictures
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For a certain kind of musical theater fan, today is a very special day.
First of all, Funny Girl opens at the August Wilson Theatre tonight, starring the irrepressible Beanie Feldstein and featuring Jule Styne’s immortal score.
Second of all, in a truly magnificent coincidence—or, very possibly, not a coincidence at all—it is the singer, actor, director, producer, et al.
Streisand, of course, led the original production of Funny Girl from 1964 to 1965 (and an Oscar-winning film adaptation in 1968), forging a Fanny Brice so completely her own that it took 60 years for the show to return to Broadway.
Here, we pay tribute to the greatest star in pictures.

     Barbra Streisand At 80: Career, Personal Life, More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She’s been an icon for decades, but it’s still hard to believe that Barbra Streisand is 80!
No matter how many candles on her cake, Barbra likes to look at the upside of being older.
“It’s easier to live in your own skin.”It’s also less difficult to accept the passing years when you’re surrounded by love like Barbra.
On her April 24 birthday, husband Jim, 81, rounded up Barbra’s son Jason Gould, 55, and Jim’s son, Josh Brolin, 54, for an intimate family gathering.
Telling her life story in her own words remains important to Barbra, but time with her family takes priority.

     Barbra Streisand’s Career Highlights
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Star Is Born Shutterstock Barbra Streisand’s first taste of applause came after a boyfriend convinced her to enter a talent contest at a gay nightclub in 1960.
A Less Than Auspicious Theatrical Debut Shutterstock Streisand’s first attempt at acting didn’t go over so well.
Another Evening with Harry Stoones, which featured her singing two solos, received terrible reviews and closed one day after opening.
Record-Breaking Music Career Getty Images With a career spanning more than 60 years, Streisand has sold more than 150 million albums worldwide.
Two Oscars, four Emmys, 9 Grammys and one special non-competitive Tony Award for Star Of The Decade in 1970 make up her honours.

     10 incredible Barbra Streisand vocals to prove her genius
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barbra Streisand is one of the strongest vocalists of her generation, imbuing her reality into the songs that have littered her life and lit our stages.
Streisand was strong enough to capture an entirely new form of music, and this tune is neither pop nor funk, but makes for something in between.
It’s a strong vocal delivery from the singer, and she acquits herself nicely to Barry Gibb‘s melody.
The song is decidedly romantic, leading some to speculate that Streisand enjoyed something more than a professional friendship with Gibb.
Indeed, an article on Funny Face could take up the rest of the article, but we’ll be sensible, and say this is a strong vocal.
