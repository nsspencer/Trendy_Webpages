     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur have failed to register a shot on target in their past two games, while Arsenal have scored seven goals in total against Chelsea and Manchester United to shoot past their north London rivals in the egg-and-spoon race for fourth place.
Tottenham fans are seething but they should be worried, because on the evidence against Brentford they do not look good enough to finish in the Champions League places.
Most striking of all on Saturday was the realisation that when Harry Kane is slightly off his game, Tottenham offer virtually no striking threat.
The England striker did not drop deep, as has been his habit this season, and was man-marked by Pontus Jansson.

     ‘Making it difficult’: Ledley King makes Harry Kane claim after Tottenham drop more points
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ledley King has claimed that teams are ‘making it difficult’ for Harry Kane by doubling up on the Tottenham striker, as he told Premier League Productions (23/04/22 at 7:35 pm).
On Saturday, for the second game running, Spurs failed to have a shot on target as they recorded a goalless draw at Brentford.
In previous games, the likes of Kane, Heung-Min Son and Dejan Kulusevski were running riot in front of goal.
“With Harry (Kane), I think teams are sensing that Tottenham like to build up through Harry,” said King.
But, at the end of the day, Spurs can’t continue to rely on their star striker to do the job.

     Summary: Report: Tottenham could make 45-cap assist specialist with 'outstanding qualities' their first summer signingTottenham are keeping tabs on Eintracht Frankfurt wing-back Filip Kostic ahead of a potential transfer this summer, according to The Independent’s Miguel Delaney.
Writing for his weekly Reading The Game column, Delaney named Kostic as one of a number of players Tottenham are keen on signing this summer.
Kostic has won 45 caps for his country, too, and is seen as a viable alternative to the likes of Ryan Sessegnon and Sergio Reguilon at left wing-back for Spurs.
But in terms of attacking play, Kostic is right up there.
Kostic will be entering the final year of his contract this summer and that could mean the door is open for Spurs here.

     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur head coach Antonio Conte could make Inter Milan ace Alessandro Bastoni his top defensive target ahead of the summer transfer window opening for business, according to journalist Dean Jones.
According to Spanish sources, Tottenham have already shown they are keen to welcome Bastoni to north London by lodging a £42million bid.
Bastoni, who is valued at £54million by Transfermarkt, was first linked with a switch to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium just a matter of days after the closure of the January transfer window.
“They have a shortlist, but it’s not in any sort of ranking, as it stands.”1 of 10 What year did the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium open?
Conte and Bastoni enjoyed a successful time together at Inter, with them winning the Serie A title last season.

     Summary: That result, coupled with Arsenal’s win over Manchester United, means that the side have dropped down to fifth and will be hoping to respond in their final five matches.
With that said, here’s a look at how their remaining fixtures look compared to their rivals.
The Foxes have struggled this season compared to their previous campaigns, sitting in tenth with one win from their last five.
Arsenal (H) - May 12While North London derbies are usually huge anyway, this one may be the biggest one in years.

     Conte remains loyal to three at the back but do Spurs need him to roll the dice?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In all four of those games, most felt Conte needed to tweak the system or make some sort of change at half-time.
In both of those latter two games, Spurs failed to register a shot on target.
It would be very unfair, then, to suggest that it’s a system that is unworkable with this Spurs team, or that change is always the answer.
It’s only two games so that may be excessive, especially given the excellent form Spurs were in before the Brighton game.
What changes, if any, do you think Antonio Conte should make for the game against Leicester City next Sunday?
