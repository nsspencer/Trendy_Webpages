     'Barry' reloads for its crackling third season without missing a beat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Barreling forward without much apparent thought to its own longevity, "Barry" returns without missing a beat, fearlessly racing through story with a mix of darkly comic violence and drop-dead-funny visual gags.
Delving deeper into Hollywood's quirks and its title character's double life, the crackling third season continues to operate like a high-wire act without a net.
After a shocking end to season two almost three years ago, Barry finds himself suspected of murder (correctly) by his former acting coach, Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler, again sensational), creating a serious dilemma for the title character given his soft spot for the guy.
Barry's girlfriend Sally (Sarah Goldberg), meanwhile, is enjoying unexpected success, having created and starring in her own TV show, though the gig brings with it considerable pressure and major hassles, from network interference to a co-star concerned about Sally and Barry's relationship.
Finally, there's Barry's other world, the one occupied by colorful personalities like his former handler Fuches (Stephen Root), as amoral a biped as ever walked, and Chechen mobster Noho Hank (Anthony Carrigan), who is carrying on a secret relationship that seriously complicates his life.

     Barry keeps killing it, and that’s the problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Partway through the third season of Barry, which premieres on HBO this weekend, the show returns to this moment.
Perhaps this is why in its third season, Barry begins to zero in on the multitude of ways a person can be violent.
It makes sense that Barry is so careful to convey this, because Barry also is a very good show about actors.
And so, as Barry has wondered since season 1, what’s the difference between performing good and being good?
Six episodes into Barry’s third season, Barry is discovering that even with his considerable skills and growing performance acumen, there is precious little that will help him bridge that gap.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is the question hanging over “Barry” when it returns Sunday after a three-year hiatus — and several dead bodies in between seasons.
Series creators and writers Hader and Alec Berg have always infused “Barry” with psychological depth, but in Season 3, the stoic, seemingly emotionless Barry is ready to blow.
His former mentor and partner-in-crime Monroe Fuches (Stephen Root) knows the real Barry, as does Chechen mobster/underworld butterfly NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan).

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘Barry’ Season 3 On HBO, Where The Already Dark Comedy Goes Even Darker — And Funnier
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BARRY SEASON 3: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?
Barry is not auditioning, and he’s finding people seeking hit men on the dark web, leading to situations where he’s dealing with indecisive amateurs.
In desperation, Barry asks Hank for work, and Hank tells him to fuck off.
Barry is about to kill his new mentor, despite the love he has for Gene — until he comes up with a plan.
Our Take: Yes, Season 2 of Barry was pretty damn dark.
