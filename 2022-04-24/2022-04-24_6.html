     'Barry' reloads for its crackling third season without missing a beat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Barreling forward without much apparent thought to its own longevity, "Barry" returns without missing a beat, fearlessly racing through story with a mix of darkly comic violence and drop-dead-funny visual gags.
Delving deeper into Hollywood's quirks and its title character's double life, the crackling third season continues to operate like a high-wire act without a net.
After a shocking end to season two almost three years ago, Barry finds himself suspected of murder (correctly) by his former acting coach, Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler, again sensational), creating a serious dilemma for the title character given his soft spot for the guy.
Barry's girlfriend Sally (Sarah Goldberg), meanwhile, is enjoying unexpected success, having created and starring in her own TV show, though the gig brings with it considerable pressure and major hassles, from network interference to a co-star concerned about Sally and Barry's relationship.
Finally, there's Barry's other world, the one occupied by colorful personalities like his former handler Fuches (Stephen Root), as amoral a biped as ever walked, and Chechen mobster Noho Hank (Anthony Carrigan), who is carrying on a secret relationship that seriously complicates his life.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is the question hanging over “Barry” when it returns Sunday after a three-year hiatus — and several dead bodies in between seasons.
Series creators and writers Hader and Alec Berg have always infused “Barry” with psychological depth, but in Season 3, the stoic, seemingly emotionless Barry is ready to blow.
His former mentor and partner-in-crime Monroe Fuches (Stephen Root) knows the real Barry, as does Chechen mobster/underworld butterfly NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan).

     Barry keeps killing it, and that’s the problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Partway through the third season of Barry, which premieres on HBO this weekend, the show returns to this moment.
Perhaps this is why in its third season, Barry begins to zero in on the multitude of ways a person can be violent.
It makes sense that Barry is so careful to convey this, because Barry also is a very good show about actors.
And so, as Barry has wondered since season 1, what’s the difference between performing good and being good?
Six episodes into Barry’s third season, Barry is discovering that even with his considerable skills and growing performance acumen, there is precious little that will help him bridge that gap.

     "Barry" returns three years later and is funnier and darker than ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bill Hader may be the objective center of "Barry," but the character that best personifies the show's blackhearted absurdity is Anthony Carrigan's Chechen mob boss NoHo Hank.
Despite this disaster, we find Hank happily unbothered in season 3 at losing so many of his "buddies," including Barry.
Barry, NoHo Hank and Stephen Root's diabolical backstabber Monroe Fuches may be irredeemable, but the writers constantly remind us they're still average guys with desires, fears and feelings.
Maybe the end will be sweeter for NoHo Hank, regardless of whether he earns it, morally speaking.
"Barry" returns for its third season on Sunday, April 24 at 10 p.m. on HBO.

     Summary: Photo: HBOIt feels like it’s been a literal lifetime since Barry’s second season ended in May 2019 — pre-pandemic, pre-insurrection, basically pre-everything.
Barry Berkman Killed Janice MossYes, this happened at the end of season one, but much of the action related to that incident drives the narrative of season three.
Near the end of the season, Fuches (Stephen Root), furious at Barry, finds Janice’s car buried in the woods near Gene’s cabin with her body in the trunk.
In season two, Detective John Loach (John Pirruccello) led the search for his missing partner, pushing Fuches to try and get Barry to confess.
Barry’s TraumaIn season two, Gene’s acting class taught its students to dig into their own backgrounds to find truth onstage.

     Summary: But after Barry saves him from the Chechens near the end of Season 1, he doesn’t have much ammunition.
Hank tells Barry to just kill him so he doesn’t have to go back to Chechnya, but Barry can’t do it.
On her way out, Sally is almost accidentally shot by Barry, who has come to the hotel to kill Sam.
She stabs Barry a few times, and Fuches drives Barry to get stitching materials at a drugstore.
Then, Barry gets a text from Hank: Fuches has shown up at the warehouse.
