     Summary: Many of the Ridge residents believe Claire killed Malva because of jealousy and or witchcraft.
Roger agrees to officiate Malva’s funeral but he’s also feeling doubts about whether he is the right person to do it.
Everyone interprets his anger like that of a grieving brother, and Jamie and Claire realize they should leave in order to deescalate the situation.
The episode avoids answering the question of Josiah and Keziah feeling attraction for each other but Lizzie’s description points toward Lizzie having two lovers.
Jamie’s plan doesn’t quite work out, as Lizzie later asks Roger to perform the handfast ceremony with Josiah.
