     Cubs Pitcher Keegan Thompson's Secret to Hot Start: Hot Yoga
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Only thing hotter than Thompson's pitching is his yoga originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoCubs manager David Ross calls right-hander Keegan Thompson his weapon out of the bullpen.
But there might yet be a secret to all that success, and if so it’s as hot as his pitching.
As in hot yoga.
If his performance arc since last season as a rookie is any indication, hot yoga might be the biggest thing in Cubs pitching workouts since Jake Arrieta and pilates.
Whether any of this is the result of the stepped-up, higher-temperature yoga, Thompson can’t say and hasn’t spent much time wondering.

     Chicago Cubs Lineup (4/24/22): Ortega Leads Off, Villar at SS, Steele Starting for Split
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With just three strikeouts on the afternoon, their constant onslaught of contact buried the Bucs in base knocks.
Rafael Ortega will get things started as the DH, followed by Seiya Suzuki in right and Willson Contreras behind the plate.
Ian Happ cleans up in left, Frank Schwindel is at first, Jonathan Villar is the shortstop, and Jason Heyward is in center.
JT Brubaker is going for the visitors as he faces the Cubs for the first time this season.
And if left-handed batters continue to give him trouble, maybe we’ll see yet another homer from that side of the plate.

     Pirates 4, Cubs 3: A long, wet journey to another defeat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I hereby submit this game, the Cubs’ 4-3 loss to the Pirates Sunday at Wrigley Field, as prima facie evidence that the pace of play in Major League Baseball is awful.
The Cubs did have some chances to come back and win in the seventh, eighth and ninth innings, but fell short.
The Cubs’ first run scored on a fielding error, after Rafael Ortega had led off with a double, with Willson Contreras at bat [VIDEO].
He was constantly behind hitters and the Pirates scored a run off him in the second and two in the third to give them a 3-2 lead.
That was later changed to a hit, but after a stolen base, another Villar error allowed a Pirates run to score [VIDEO].
