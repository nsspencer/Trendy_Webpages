     What is going on with the Utah Jazz rebrand?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been a rather notable past couple of days as it relates to what the Utah Jazz’s upcoming rebrand could look like.
The Jazz are changing their colors to black, white, and yellow next season.
While that question remains somewhat of a mystery, Jazz owner Ryan Smith added some intrigue to the rebrand discussion on Saturday after Game 4 of the playoff series.
His comments came about as the Twitter account Jazz Uniform Tracker observed that Smith has been wearing purple at games more often.
https://t.co/gpnibsfsKX — Ryan Smith (@RyanQualtrics) April 24, 2022To be sure, it is unclear if purple will be a main color of the rebrand or just one that is featured on occasion.

     Jazz center Rudy Gobert fined $25,000 for using profanity in interview after Game 4 win over Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NBA announced on Sunday that Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert has been fined $25,000 for using profanity in an interview following the team's 110-109 win over the Dallas Mavericks in Game 4 of their first-round series.
Following the win, Gobert did an on-court interview with NBATV's Matt Winer, who asked the big man about the potential of this Jazz team.
"Man, f--- the talk," Gobert said.
"We just try to be the best team we can be, we try to enjoy the moment, and whatever happens, happens."
But at least for now, they have been spared more of "the talk" that Gobert was referencing.

     Summary: With about 40 seconds left Luka Doncic hit what looked like a back-breaking three to finish off the Utah Jazz.
Donovan Mitchell did what everyone has been begging for all season, he came up clutch.
The next possession down he willed his way to a massive and-1 that got the Jazz within 1 of the Dallas Mavericks.
This game is in Dallas, but the Jazz may have just had the shot to the chest they needed.
Luka Dončić does not appear at all on Dallas' injury report for Game 5 against visiting Utah on Monday night.

     Summary: Chris Nicoll-USA TODAY SportsWe’ve heard continued rumors about a potential Donovan Mitchell trade from the Utah Jazz with the New York Knicks bandied about as a potential landing spot.
In an interesting situation, New York Knicks executive vice president William Wesley was seen sitting courtside for a Jazz home game against the Mavericks last week.
But that’s going to be hard to prove given that Wesley has not spoken directly about Donovan Mitchell trade rumors.

“For most of the game, we read what the defense gave us,” said Gobert.
“We won the game with our defense, and that’s who we are and what we have to bring every single night,” agreed Bogdanovic.
We did it for one game — now we’ve got to do it again,” he said.
We got a crucial game, and it’s a new series, and we’ve got to go back to Dallas and get a win.
