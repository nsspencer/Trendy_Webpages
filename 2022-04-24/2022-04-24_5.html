     Barry Season 3: Anthony Carrigan on What Makes Hank so Lovable
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the season 3 version of Barry is less human than ever before.
One episode into season 3, Chechen mobster Noho Hank (Anthony Carrigan) is once again one the most delightful characters on television.
According to the actor who plays him, however, balancing Hank’s cartoonish qualities with the real person underneath is one of the series’ biggest challenges.
“It’s just about being mindful that this is a real person,” Carrigan tells Den of Geek about his cheerful mobster.
He’s completely unaware.”Though extremely funny, Hank is indeed as real a person as any outsized fictional character can be.

     'Barry' season 3 review: Bill Hader reloads for the HBO show's crackling third season without missing a beat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Delving deeper into Hollywood’s quirks and its title character’s double life, the crackling third season continues to operate like a high-wire act without a net.
Both Hader and Winkler have earned well-deserved Emmys for the show, but the cast is first-rate from top to bottom.
Instead, “The Baby” toddles along, adding a perverse spin to the notion that a kid can ruin someone’s life.
Season 3 of “Barry” and “The Baby” premiere at 10 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
ET on April 24 on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

     ‘Barry’ is at its best when Barry is at his worst. And Season 3 is a master class
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is the question hanging over “Barry” when it returns Sunday after a three-year hiatus — and several dead bodies in between seasons.
Series creators and writers Hader and Alec Berg have always infused “Barry” with psychological depth, but in Season 3, the stoic, seemingly emotionless Barry is ready to blow.
His former mentor and partner-in-crime Monroe Fuches (Stephen Root) knows the real Barry, as does Chechen mobster/underworld butterfly NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan).

     Barry keeps killing it, and that’s the problem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Partway through the third season of Barry, which premieres on HBO this weekend, the show returns to this moment.
Perhaps this is why in its third season, Barry begins to zero in on the multitude of ways a person can be violent.
It makes sense that Barry is so careful to convey this, because Barry also is a very good show about actors.
And so, as Barry has wondered since season 1, what’s the difference between performing good and being good?
Six episodes into Barry’s third season, Barry is discovering that even with his considerable skills and growing performance acumen, there is precious little that will help him bridge that gap.

     Stream It Or Skip It: ‘Barry’ Season 3 On HBO, Where The Already Dark Comedy Goes Even Darker — And Funnier
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BARRY SEASON 3: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?
Barry is not auditioning, and he’s finding people seeking hit men on the dark web, leading to situations where he’s dealing with indecisive amateurs.
In desperation, Barry asks Hank for work, and Hank tells him to fuck off.
Barry is about to kill his new mentor, despite the love he has for Gene — until he comes up with a plan.
Our Take: Yes, Season 2 of Barry was pretty damn dark.

     Summary: Barry forgiving jeff Season 3 Episode 1 Editor’s Rating 5 stars * * * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Merrick Morton/HBOFor all the show’s crime-drama underpinnings, Barry often resembles an addiction story more than anything else.
It wouldn’t be accurate to call cold-blooded murder a “comfort” to Barry; he’s known since before the first episode that killing isn’t exactly self-care.
And only moments later, when the client decides to renege and forgive Jeff after all, Barry can’t even be bothered to listen to the guy’s full explanation.
Sally can’t see what her boyfriend is going through because she’s too distracted living her dream.
Last season, Sally strove for authenticity in telling the story of her own abuse.
