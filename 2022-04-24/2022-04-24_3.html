     In a First for the Air Force, a General Is Convicted of Sex Abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: General Cooley faces up to seven years in prison and dismissal from the Air Force, but his rank could not be reduced as part of this process, said Derek Kaufman, a spokesman for the Air Force.
A lawyer for General Cooley, Daniel Conway, did not immediately respond to an email on Sunday.
These changes include policy developments that better support accusers, greater sensitivity by military leadership to sexual assault, increased procedural protections for victims, and prosecutors who are more likely to believe survivors.
General Cooley’s conviction “is a hopeful sign, for sure,” Mr. Guilds said.
“The reality, though, is that every survivor who decides to come forward and make that brave choice is going to confront a justice system that is going to be very challenging.”

     General convicted in first U.S. Air Force sexual misconduct trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. Air Force announced Saturday that a major general was found guilty by a military judge of one of three abusive sexual contact specifications in Ohio.
"Today marks the first time an Air Force general officer has been held responsible for his heinous actions," said the victim, an Air Force civilian employee, in a statement via her personal attorney, Ryan Guilds, according to the Dayton Daily News.
Details: Cooley faced one charge of sexual assault under Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, with three specifications — one of forcible kissing and two of forcible touching, according to an Air Force charge sheet.
The former Air Force Research Laboratory commander was found guilty of the first specification, but cleared of the other two by Col. Christina Jimenez, the senior military judge in the case, the Air Force said.
What they're saying: "This case clearly demonstrates the commitment of Air Force leaders to fully investigate the facts and hold Airmen of any rank accountable for their actions when they fail to uphold Air Force standards," said Col. Eric Mejia, Staff Judge Advocate for Air Force Materiel Command, in a statement.

     Summary: A historic court martial ends with the first conviction of an Air Force generalEnlarge this image toggle caption Wesley Farnsworth/AP Wesley Farnsworth/APA historic trial within the ranks of the U.S. military has ended with the first-ever conviction of an Air Force general in a court martial.
Cooley was commander of the Air Force Research Laboratory, but he was relieved of command in early 2020 during the investigation into the allegations against him.
At trial at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, Cooley's sister-in-law said Cooley requested a ride after a 2018 barbecue where he drank alcohol.
After the verdict, she said she hoped the next sexual assault survivor would have an easier time coming forward than she did, Goldstein reported.
Still, the number of U.S. military court martials for sexual assault pales in comparison to the thousands of service members who have experienced some form of sexual assault in the military, according to Pentagon data.

Cooley entered the Air Force through the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program in 1988 and entered active duty in 1990, according to his biography on the Air Force website.
He also completed a master's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Mexico and a PhD in engineering physics from the Air Force Institute of Technology.
Cooley became the commander of the Air Force Research Laboratory in 2017, a role in which he was responsible for managing a $2.5 billion science and technology program and a further $2.3 billion in externally funded research and development, according to the Air Force.

     Split verdict in first-ever Air Force general military trial
    </h2>

     Summary: WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Ohio (AP) — An Air Force major general in Ohio has been convicted by a military judge of one of three specifications of abusive sexual contact in the first-ever military trial of an Air Force general.
Officials said the verdict marks the first court-martial trial and conviction of a general officer in the Air Force’s 75-year history.
Cooley had the option of a trial by court member jurors or by military judge, and chose to have the case heard by the judge.
“Today marks the first time an Air Force general officer has been held responsible for his heinous actions,” the woman's attorney Ryan Guilds, said in a statement, the Dayton Daily News reported.
