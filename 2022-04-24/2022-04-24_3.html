     Convulsed by War, Tearful Ukrainians Mark Orthodox Easter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Parniyan Zemaryalai and Hamuda HassanKYIV/KRAMATORSK (Reuters) -President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that light would defeat darkness and Kyiv would triumph over Russia as Ukrainians marked a bitterly emotional Orthodox Easter overshadowed by the grinding two-month-old war.
Ukrainians flocked to churches on Sunday morning to mark what they call the Great Day after their centuries-old tradition of midnight Easter services was abandoned the night before over fears of Russian shelling and a nationwide curfew.
Long queues formed outside the cathedral as worshippers carrying baskets of ornately painted Easter eggs and paska, a traditional Ukrainian Easter bread, waited to receive blessings from a priest.
Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the eastern Luhansk region, said that seven churches there have been destroyed during the war.
While churches used to be full for overnight and morning Easter services, this year churches have been asked not to gather many people, with concerns they could be targets for missiles.

     Biden notes ‘brutality of war’ in Orthodox Easter message amid Ukraine invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Biden spoke to individuals experiencing “the brutality of war” in his Sunday statement commemorating Orthodox Easter, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its third month.
Biden said he and first lady Jill Biden are praying for people impacted by the war, and mourning for individuals whose loved ones have died.
“During this sacred season, we hold in our prayers all those who are suffering from the brutality of war and persecution,” Biden said in a statement.
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres had pushed for a four-day “humanitarian pause” between Holy Thursday and Orthodox Easter Sunday “to allow for the opening of a series of humanitarian corridors,” but Russia rejected the idea.
