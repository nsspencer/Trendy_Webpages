     Chicago Cubs Lineup: Jonathan Villar at Shortstop
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The nature of this Cubs offense isn’t nearly as feast or famine as it has appeared in this series against the Pirates.
Rafael Ortega, DH2.
Nick Madrigal, 2BNico Hoerner is getting a breather today, and the Cubs are filling in as best they can without a true backup shortstop.
Nick Madrigal takes his “second leadoff” spot in the order and Jonathan Villar will cover the position, despite some defensive issues at third base (maybe some slightly shorter throws will help …?).
Actively managing his work load is of the utmost importance for the Cubs coaching staff – and not just for this season.

     Cubs Pitcher Keegan Thompson's Secret to Hot Start: Hot Yoga
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Only thing hotter than Thompson's pitching is his yoga originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoCubs manager David Ross calls right-hander Keegan Thompson his weapon out of the bullpen.
But there might yet be a secret to all that success, and if so it’s as hot as his pitching.
As in hot yoga.
If his performance arc since last season as a rookie is any indication, hot yoga might be the biggest thing in Cubs pitching workouts since Jake Arrieta and pilates.
Whether any of this is the result of the stepped-up, higher-temperature yoga, Thompson can’t say and hasn’t spent much time wondering.

     Summary: With just three strikeouts on the afternoon, their constant onslaught of contact buried the Bucs in base knocks.
Rafael Ortega will get things started as the DH, followed by Seiya Suzuki in right and Willson Contreras behind the plate.
Ian Happ cleans up in left, Frank Schwindel is at first, Jonathan Villar is the shortstop, and Jason Heyward is in center.
JT Brubaker is going for the visitors as he faces the Cubs for the first time this season.
And if left-handed batters continue to give him trouble, maybe we’ll see yet another homer from that side of the plate.
