     Summary: Will Barton's 3-pointer secures the victory for the Nuggets as they survive and earn their first win of the series against Warriors.
It was a reversal of final-minute fortunes for the Nuggets, who faltered down the stretch in a five-point loss in Game 3.
“We felt like it could have been 2-2 if we didn't drop that last game,” said Rivers, who noted the Nuggets finally matched the Warriors' physicality, especially down the stretch.
Thompson said the Warriors need to be loose ones in Game 5, playing as though their season was on the line, not Denver's.
Nuggets: Rivers had five steals.

     Summary: Warriors vs. Nuggets OddsWarriors Odds -4.5 Nuggets Odds +4.5 Over/Under 225 Time 3:30 p.m.
Despite being overmatched for much of this series, the Nuggets have shown no signs of giving up.
Will the reigning MVP Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets win and stave off elimination, or will Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors advance to the Second Round of the NBA Playoffs?
Holding a 69-59 lead at the half, the Warriors allowed a 15-5 run to start the third quarter, finding themselves in a dogfight with a desperate Nuggets team.
Despite a solid offensive output, it almost doesn’t matter considering that they don’t have the personnel to slow down this Warriors team on defense.

Andrew Wiggins added 20 points, six rebounds, two steals and two blocks for Golden State.
After getting a screen from Jokic, Morris recognized that instead of dropping, Looney stayed with Jokic, leaving the middle wide open.
"They were more physical with him tonight ... That's to be expected," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after the game.
With Jokic out of the game for defensive purposes, the Warriors faced a crucial inbounds play, trailing by two with 33.5 seconds left.
