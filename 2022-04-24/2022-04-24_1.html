     Ukrainian cities take heavy shelling as both sides mark Orthodox Easter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian forces continued heavy shelling of Ukrainian cities on Sunday as people in both countries observed Orthodox Easter and the US secretaries of state and defence prepared to make their first visit to Kyiv since the invasion.
“The Russian army continued to actively shell peaceful cities in Ukraine and kill civilians,” said Liudmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian parliament’s human rights ombudsman.
Most of the Easter fighting focused on the eastern Donbas region where Ukrainian forces are concentrated and where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war.
Earlier in the day, Kyiv had called for a truce in battered Mariupol for Orthodox Easter, celebrated in both Russia and Ukraine.

     Ukrainian refugees dream of home in Orthodox Easter celebrations

     Summary: By Pawel Florkiewicz, Michael Kahn and Riham AlkousaaWARSAW/PRAGUE/BERLIN (Reuters) – Ukrainian refugees filled churches across central Europe on Sunday for Orthodox Easter in bittersweet celebrations, giving thanks for escaping a Russian invasion but dreaming of a return home to family members left behind.

We came with nothing and here people help each other.”As Ukrainians celebrated Orthodox Easter on Sunday, there was no end in sight to a war that has killed thousands, uprooted millions and reduced cities to rubble.
Inside Ukraine, subdued Easter celebrations took place across the country as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed in an Orthodox Easter message that no “wickedness” would destroy the country.
“It’s good to see so many people here that can celebrate Easter.”“It’s my first Easter celebration not in Ukraine.
