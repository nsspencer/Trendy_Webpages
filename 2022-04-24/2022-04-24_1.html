     Soccer-Liverpool back on Man City’s tail after derby win over Everton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Peter HallLIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) – Liverpool closed the gap at the top of the Premier League standings to one point after a hard-fought 2-0 win over Everton in a feisty Merseyside derby on Sunday.
Everton continued to hold their own in a raucous derby atmosphere until, with the first shot on target from either side in the match, Scottish fullback Andy Robertson headed his team in front in the 62nd minute.
A 12th win in their last 13 league games, which was much tougher to come by than many expected, moved Liverpool on to 79 points from 33 matches, one behind City, who must slip-up if Liverpool are to win back their Premier League crown.
Everton can take heart from a spirited performance, but finish the day in the relegation zone, two points behind Burnley after their victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers saw them climb to 17th.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kop taunted Everton with chants of “Going down” while Liverpool refused to give up on catching Manchester City in the title race.
Robertson timed his second goal of the season to perfection from a Liverpool perspective with nerves increasing among the home support before his 62nd-minute breakthrough.
The sense of foreboding that accompanied Everton to Anfield deepened before a ball had been kicked in the 240th Merseyside derby.
Richarlison went down holding his face after a touch from Fabinho early on.
Origi ghosted in behind two Everton defenders to beat Pickford with a close-range header.
