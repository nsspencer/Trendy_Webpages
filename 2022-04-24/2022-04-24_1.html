     Steve Kerr Explains Questionable Play Call to End Game 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With just 33 seconds left in the game, and the Nuggets leading 123-121, the Warriors had a chance to tie.
Steve Kerr drew up an inbounds lob for Andrew Wiggins, which ultimately resulted in a turnover.
After the game, Kerr explained that questionable play call.
If we get a 2-for-1, then we can tie the game and have a chance to win it at the end.
While Kerr explained his initial vision, he took accountability by admitting he would like that play call back.

     Warriors observations: Steph Curry heroics thwarted as Nuggets force Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over 31 minutes, Thompson scored 32 points and made his first five 3-point attempts.
He scored 19 in Game 1, 21 in Game 2, 26 in Game 3 and then 32 in Game 4.
He was averaging nearly 29 points coming into Game 4 and was the Warriors' No.
Kuminga looked a bit lost at first but quickly showed the kind of spark he can bring to the Warriors.
He didn't come back into the game after the second quarter, and it will be awfully interesting to see how he's used in Game 5 and beyond.
