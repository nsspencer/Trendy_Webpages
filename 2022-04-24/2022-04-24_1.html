     Summary: With just 33 seconds left in the game, and the Nuggets leading 123-121, the Warriors had a chance to tie.
Steve Kerr drew up an inbounds lob for Andrew Wiggins, which ultimately resulted in a turnover.
After the game, Kerr explained that questionable play call.
If we get a 2-for-1, then we can tie the game and have a chance to win it at the end.
While Kerr explained his initial vision, he took accountability by admitting he would like that play call back.

     Denver Nuggets avoid series sweep with gritty Game 4 win over Golden State Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Denver Nuggets avoided a first-round series sweep against the Golden State Warriors with a gritty 126-121 home win at Ball Arena.
Reigning MVP Nikola Jokic put up a game-high 37 points for the Nuggets, shooting an absurdly efficient 66.7% from the field, to go along with eight rebounds and six assists.
Denver led for most of the game, finding themselves up by as many as 17 in the second quarter, but buoyed by a combined 65 from Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, the Warriors roared back in the closing stages to take a two-point lead.
However, two huge buckets from Jokic and Monte Morris put the Nuggets back up after Austin Reaves secured a huge defensive stop from a Warriors' inbound pass, before Will Barton sealed with the win with a dagger three-pointer with six seconds remaining.

     Warriors take accountability for foul issues in Game 4 loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Denver wound up with four more fouls called against them, and took just four more free throws than the Warriors.
With Curry coming off the bench for the fourth straight game, Klay Thompson took the reins as the Warriors' go-to scorer early on and throughout the day.
After being called for his third foul, Thompson sat for over six minutes until coming back into the game with 0.6 seconds left in the first half.
Instead of using the refs as an excuse, Thompson took it upon himself for trying to get away with a fast one.
"Aaron Gordon got behind the defense, I took a swipe at the ball, called a foul," Green said.
