     Warriors take accountability for foul issues in Game 4 loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Denver wound up with four more fouls called against them, and took just four more free throws than the Warriors.
With Curry coming off the bench for the fourth straight game, Klay Thompson took the reins as the Warriors' go-to scorer early on and throughout the day.
After being called for his third foul, Thompson sat for over six minutes until coming back into the game with 0.6 seconds left in the first half.
Instead of using the refs as an excuse, Thompson took it upon himself for trying to get away with a fast one.
"Aaron Gordon got behind the defense, I took a swipe at the ball, called a foul," Green said.
