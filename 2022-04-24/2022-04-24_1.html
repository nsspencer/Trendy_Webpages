     Convulsed by war, tearful Ukrainians mark Orthodox Easter

     Summary: A Ukrainian woman takes part in an Easter Mass at the Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine April 24, 2022.
REUTERS/Ueslei MarcelinoKYIV/KRAMATORSK, April 24 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that light would defeat darkness and Kyiv would triumph over Russia as Ukrainians marked a bitterly emotional Orthodox Easter overshadowed by the grinding two-month-old war.
Long queues formed outside the cathedral as worshippers carrying baskets of ornately painted Easter eggs and paska, a traditional Ukrainian Easter bread, waited to receive blessings from a priest.
Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the eastern Luhansk region, said that seven churches there have been destroyed during the war.
While churches used to be full for overnight and morning Easter services, this year churches have been asked not to gather many people, with concerns they could be targets for missiles.
