     Steve Kerr Explains Questionable Play Call to End Game 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With just 33 seconds left in the game, and the Nuggets leading 123-121, the Warriors had a chance to tie.
Steve Kerr drew up an inbounds lob for Andrew Wiggins, which ultimately resulted in a turnover.
After the game, Kerr explained that questionable play call.
If we get a 2-for-1, then we can tie the game and have a chance to win it at the end.
While Kerr explained his initial vision, he took accountability by admitting he would like that play call back.

     Warriors take accountability for foul issues in Game 4 loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Denver wound up with four more fouls called against them, and took just four more free throws than the Warriors.
With Curry coming off the bench for the fourth straight game, Klay Thompson took the reins as the Warriors' go-to scorer early on and throughout the day.
After being called for his third foul, Thompson sat for over six minutes until coming back into the game with 0.6 seconds left in the first half.
Instead of using the refs as an excuse, Thompson took it upon himself for trying to get away with a fast one.
"Aaron Gordon got behind the defense, I took a swipe at the ball, called a foul," Green said.

     Summary: After trailing by as many as 17 points, the Warriors made a valiant comeback behind 33 points from Stephen Curry and 32 from Klay Thompson.
Andrew Wiggins added 20 points, six rebounds, two steals and two blocks for Golden State.
After getting a screen from Jokic, Morris recognized that instead of dropping, Looney stayed with Jokic, leaving the middle wide open.

     Summary: Will Barton's 3-pointer secures the victory for the Nuggets as they survive and earn their first win of the series against Warriors.
It was a reversal of final-minute fortunes for the Nuggets, who faltered down the stretch in a five-point loss in Game 3.
“We felt like it could have been 2-2 if we didn't drop that last game,” said Rivers, who noted the Nuggets finally matched the Warriors' physicality, especially down the stretch.
Thompson said the Warriors need to be loose ones in Game 5, playing as though their season was on the line, not Denver's.
Nuggets: Rivers had five steals.
