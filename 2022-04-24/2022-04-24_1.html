     Soccer-Liverpool keep up chase with derby win, Burnley add to Everton’s woes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea kept a grip on third place but needed a last-minute goal from American Christian Pulisic to beat West Ham United 1-0 at Stamford Bridge.
City, who beat lowly Watford 5-1 on Saturday, have 80 points from 33 games with Liverpool on 79 from the same number of matches.
‘NICE RECORD’Origi has now scored six times in nine games against Everton in the Premier League.
Lampard’s side are now in 18th place on 29 points from 32 games while Burnley are two points ahead having played one game more.
West Ham defender Craig Dawson was shown a red card after a check by the Video Assistant Referee following a clumsy foul on substitute Romelu Lukaku which resulted in the penalty.

     Liverpool back on Manchester City's tail after derby win over Everton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mohamed Salah combined with substitute Origi before floating a cross to Robertson, who headed past the diving Jordan Pickford.
Luis Diaz tried a bicycle-kick volley from a Jordan Henderson cross and the ball bounced to Origi, who headed home from close range.
The Belgian, a fringe player for most of his time at Anfield, has now scored six goals in nine Merseyside Premier League clashes.
A 12th win in their last 13 league games, moved Liverpool on to 79 points from 33 matches, one behind City, who must slip up if Liverpool are to win back their Premier League crown.
Burnley's 1-0 win over Wolves left Everton in 18th place on 29 points from 32 games with the Clarets on 31 points from 33 games.

     Five things seen in Liverpool vs Everton as Andy Robertson heroics support Divock Origi swansong
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following Burnley’s win earlier in the day, Everton made the trip across Stanley Park in the relegation zone.
While the loss sent the Blues deeper into relegation worry, it returned Liverpool to within a point of Manchester City.
Robertson heroicsMuch as Origi's contributions will not be forgotten in a hurry, the goal itself was scored by the head of Robertson: literally and figuratively.
As for Alexander-Arnold, he appeared to broadly get to grips with his task as the game went on, but was forced to take a cynical booking in the second half.
Alongside Jordan Pickford, Richarlison was the orchestrator-in-chief of a bitty, stop-start game designed to frustrate Liverpool.

     Robertson and Origi sink Everton to keep Liverpool on title trail
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kop taunted Everton with chants of “Going down” while Liverpool refused to give up on catching Manchester City in the title race.
Robertson timed his second goal of the season to perfection from a Liverpool perspective with nerves increasing among the home support before his 62nd-minute breakthrough.
The sense of foreboding that accompanied Everton to Anfield deepened before a ball had been kicked in the 240th Merseyside derby.
Richarlison went down holding his face after a touch from Fabinho early on.
Origi ghosted in behind two Everton defenders to beat Pickford with a close-range header.
