     Ross Chastain Wins At Talladega After Frantic Final Lap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The second stage concluded with the field trying to chase down a freight train of all four Hendrick Motorsports cars led by William Byron.
Byron won the stage, followed by Chase Elliott and Kyle Larson.
After the final round of pit stops, Joe Gibbs Racing’s Denny Hamlin and Kyle Larson led the race in a single-file line.
It seemed that Byron and Elliott would pull a second line up to the front to reconnect with the Hendrick teammate like in the second stage, but Petty GMS’ Erik Jones jumped out in front of the second line.
Jones moved up to block Larson’s run, opening the door for Trackhouse’s Ross Chastain to have a clear path to the finish line.

     Ross Chastain converts last-lap pass, wins Talladega thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s all it took for Ross Chastain to drop a watermelon and raise a trophy in celebration.
Chastain was running third behind Erik Jones and Kyle Larson with one lap remaining.
Larson pulled out of line to the outside, poised to make a pass for the lead.
But Jones pulled in front of Larson to block the momentum while Chastain kept his No.
Tried to defend the 5 (Larson), but was too far ahead already and obviously it opened the door for the 1 (Chastain).

     Ross Chastain makes late pass to win Cup race at Talladega
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a last-lap shuffle, Ross Chastain snuck through to win the Cup Series race at Talladega Superspeedway on Sunday afternoon.
As cars crashed behind them, Chastain stayed low and charged past both to score his second career win, both coming in the past five races.
Chastain used the same car at Talladega that he used to win at COTA.
Larson led 32 laps Sunday despite entering the race with just 31 circuits led on superspeedways.
Chastain had never finished better than 12th at Talladega and wins courtesy of the 30th last-lap pass in Talladega history.

     Ross Chastain Triumphs Amid Last-Lap Chaos at Talladega
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite an early scare for mid-pack contact between Joey Logano and Jones, stage one stayed calm and caution-free almost in its entirety.
23 was ahead at the moment of caution, and Wallace scored his first stage win of the season and third of his career.
pic.twitter.com/pfGgf2iumt — NASCAR (@NASCAR) April 24, 2022“I felt a lot of things that didn’t feel good, I will tell you that much,” Logano said.
William Byron won stage two from his teammates Elliott and Larson for his third stage win of 2022.
But the Hendrick foursome got split up during pit stops before the final stage and never again found themselves all together in the pack.

     Ross Chastain steals victory from Erik Jones at Talladega Superspeedway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chastain stole the win Sunday when leader Erik Jones moved out of his way to defensively block reigning NASCAR champion Kyle Larson.
It cleared the lane for Chastain, who pointed his Chevrolet straight, slipped past Jones and collected his second career Cup victory.
The race was Jones' to control on the final lap, and he knew Larson would make a move for the win.
"Looking back, I wish I would have stayed on the bottom and let [Chastain] push me," Jones said.
Ross Chastain's victory at Talladega Superspeedway was his second Cup win in the past five races.
