     Summary: At least she admits to Jamie that she’s been huffing ether to escape, so that’s something, right?
But Claire and Jamie override him, saying that they’ll have a service, and Roger will lead it.
Jamie carries Malva’s corpse into the surgery so Claire can stitch her wounds.
Herself is in a verra bad way, shaking and hearing both Malva and Lionel Brown taunting her.
Though she staves off her feelings of despair with a few slugs of whisky, eventually she’s reaching for the mask again.

     Outlander review, Episode 607: “Sticks and Stones”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Outlander season 6 is living up to all the hype the cast and crew were spreading before the premiere.
That could have been an ether-induced dream, but maybe not…In any case, there is a murderer on the loose in Fraser’s Ridge.
Drama on Fraser’s Ridge and two Outlander “weddings”Throughout the episode, the residents of Fraser’s Ridge can’t help but cast a suspicious eye at Claire.
VerdictNext week is the Outlander season 6 finale, and I’m not entirely sure how we are already here.
With war on the horizon, I don’t think Fraser’s Ridge is prepared for what’s headed its way.

I have a serious question, though: Is Lizzie supposed to be an idiot?
That’s especially true of Claire and Jamie, who have much bigger problems than the Ridge’s resident throuple.
This will all certainly come into play by the end of the season.
And while she’s supposed to be talking about Jamie here, doesn’t it sound like there could be a whole list of suspects that fit this description?
