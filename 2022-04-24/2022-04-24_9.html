     Gaslit review – a star-powered Watergate drama that grips and doesn’t let go
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everything about Gaslit (StarzPlay) is at the pinnacle of prestige television as it stands in 2022.
Gaslit tells the story of the Watergate scandal, starting in January 1972, five months before that infamous break-in at the DNC headquarters.
(This isn’t light on symbolism, and those familiar with the Martha Mitchell side of the story will spot many signposts along the way.)
Martha Mitchell is, to all intents and purposes, the lead character here, and Roberts knows it.
Gaslit has taken its ample ingredients and turned them into a very good, very watchable drama that steadily finds its feet.

     Gaslit review: A searing critique of political corruption
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Gaslit, the new Starz drama about the scandal, isn’t just a show about political corruption or a satire about the buffoonery of arrogant government officials.
The year of the ratOf course, not everyone in Gaslit is blinded by their loyalty to America’s 37th president.
Standing in stark opposition to Liddy and Nixon’s other followers is Martha Mitchell (Julia Roberts), the wife of U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell (Sean Penn).
Opposite her, Penn is fittingly sleazy — if a little underused — as John Mitchell, a political scumbag of the highest order who is brought to life in the show via several layers of impressive prosthetic makeup.
One man’s willIt’s in the depiction of Liddy that Gaslit is at its most scathing and sharp.

     Why Hollywood Still Loves Watergate: Fifty Years Later, The Scandal Inspires ‘Gaslit’ And More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Starz’s new Gaslit, premiering Sunday, central Watergate figure John Dean is played by Dan Stevens.
“The story is picaresque, with weird and wonderful characters including Martha Mitchell, but it’s also a drama that played out differently from something that we all watched.
A Netflix documentary, The Martha Mitchell Effect, focuses on the wife of Attorney General and later Nixon election campaign chair John Mitchell.
“There is this ongoing side of what really happened in Watergate,” Chapin says.
I’m on one side, he’s on the other.”Chapin also has a more nuanced view of Martha Mitchell.
