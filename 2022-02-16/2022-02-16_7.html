    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Supermodel Linda Evangelista has come out of seclusion five years after a botched CoolSculpting “fat-freezing” procedure that left her “permanently deformed and brutally disfigured.”The 56-year-old opens up to People in their latest issue about the emotional and physical pain she has been in, saying, “I loved being up on the catwalk.
Now I dread running into someone I know.
Evangelista tells People, “It wasn't even a little bit better.
If I walk without a girdle in a dress, I will have chafing to the point of almost bleeding.
Because it's not like soft fat rubbing, it's like hard fat rubbing.”She adds, “I don't look in the mirror.

     Linda Evangelista talks about injury from cosmetic procedure gone allegedly wrong
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Linda Evangelista is sharing photos of herself several months after suffering from a cosmetic procedure that alleges left her "brutally disfigured."
The legendary supermodel, 56, discussed with People what life has looked like for her after revealing last September that a cosmetic CoolSculpting procedure had allegedly gone wrong for her.
CoolSculpting is an FDA-cleared cosmetic procedure that's been performed more than 8 million times, according to the company's website.
It's marketed as a non-surgical way to target fat cells -- freezing them so that they eventually break down.
"I hope I can shed myself of some of the shame and help other people who are in the same situation as me," said Evangelista.

Evangelista can no longer put her arms flat to her sides because of rectangular bulges under them.
“I don’t think designers are going to want to dress me with that sticking out of my body,” she said.
“I don’t recognize me as a person any longer,” Evangelista told People, speaking through tears.

It increased, not decreased, my fat cells and left me permanently deformed even after undergoing two painful, unsuccessful, corrective surgeries,” Evangelista said in the statement.
Evangelista told People that she began noticing protrusions in the areas she was treating.

The procedure is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and the side effects Evangelista experienced are rare and disclosed to patients.
Because it’s not like soft fat rubbing, it’s like hard fat rubbing.”"The bulges and protrusions are permanent she says, and so they may not go away," Sheeler said.

     Linda Evangelista reflects on impact her fat-freezing 'disfigurement' had on relationship with son

     Linda Evangelista recently shared how a rare side effect from a fat-freezing procedure she underwent five years ago has left her 'brutally disfigured' and a recluse.
Now the supermodel, 56, is talking about the devastating impact that the aftermath of CoolSculpting - which increased her fat cells instead of decreasing them - had on her relationship with son Augustin James Evangelista, 15.
I hate what this has done to my relationship with him,' she said in an interview with PEOPLE.
Evangelista explained that she retreated from the public eye after the cosmetic procedure - which was designed to decrease fat cells but actually made her fat cells increase - and bulges began to appear all over her body.
In June 2016 Linda underwent a full body liposuction procedure which she claims she paid for.
