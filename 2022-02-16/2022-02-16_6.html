     Lakers: Initial Reports on Anthony Davis' Ankle Bring Good News
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Playing against the Jazz in the final game before the All-Star break, Anthony Davis went down hard and appeared to be in a lot of pain.
Just a few minutes before halftime, Davis went to catch a lob from Malik Monk and came down on the foot of Rudy Gobert.
But the good news is that despite how bad it looked, immediate x-rays on Davis' ankle came back negative.
Davis will receive treatment on the ankle and his status will be updated once the break is over.
But in other good news, the Lakers rallied back to beat the Jazz for the second time this season.

     Anthony Davis is expected to be out for at least the next two weeks with a sprained right ankle, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin.
Davis suffered the injury during the second quarter of the Los Angeles Lakers' 106-101 victory against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night.

     Anthony Davis has to be carried off the court by his teammates after going down on his leg before halftime.
Lakers coach Frank Vogel said Davis has an MRI scheduled for Thursday, and the team said he will be re-evaluated after the upcoming All-Star break.
Late in the second quarter, Davis went airborne to catch a lob pass from Malik Monk and came down on Rudy Gobert's heel.
Lakers forward LeBron James said Davis left the arena on crutches.
"It's very deflating to see AD go down the way he did, and our guys tried to rally the necessary energy to start the second half," Vogel said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Anthony Davis suffered a gruesome-looking ankle injury in the Lakers’ win over the Jazz.
He had 17 points in 17 minutes of play before going down.
It will be the second time this season when Davis is out for an extended period of time.
Davis is averaging 23.1 points, 9.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists in 35.1 minutes per game this year.
Davis’ injury came just days after sports analyst Stephen A. Smith called for the Lakers to trade him due to health concerns.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Now the idea of the team trading Anthony Davis has been broached, and it might make more sense than people think.
Because everyone knows the Lakers won’t get equal value for what Davis brings on the court.
While trading Davis could bring in more assets which the Lakers lack, it would only serve as a bandaid to the overall wounds this franchise is currently suffering through.
These Lakers aren’t far off from a complete overhaul if they’re going to consider trading Davis.
A Davis trade won’t solve all the Lakers’ problems, but it might be the best way to start another reconstruction of this outdated roster.

     Lakers’ Anthony Davis badly rolls right ankle against Jazz

     LOS ANGELES (AP) — Anthony Davis has missed over one-third of the Los Angeles Lakers games this season due to injuries.
Davis sprained his right ankle during the second quarter of Wednesday night’s game against the Utah Jazz.
The Lakers said an X-ray on Davis’ ankle was negative and that he would receive further treatment during the upcoming All-Star break.
Coach Frank Vogel said after the Lakers’ 106-101 win that Davis would get an MRI on Thursday to assess the severity of the sprain.
Despite beating Utah to snap a three-game losing streak, Los Angeles (27-31) goes into the break in ninth place in the Western Conference.

     No, it was what Davis’ injury represented for this team this season that made it feel all the more deflating.
“Just shaking his head about really everything,” head coach Frank Vogel said of his interaction with Davis at halftime.
But after the game, the mood was still relatively somber around Davis’ injury.
I just wish him the best.”James revealed that Davis was on crutches at halftime when the team saw him.
After hanging with the Jazz for much of the first half, Davis’ injury gave way to Utah (predictably) seizing control of the game as the Lakers looked shell-shocked and ready for the All-Star break.

Due to the All-Star break, the Lakers will only play three games between today and March 2, but there’s certainly no guarantee Davis will be ready to return on March 3.
He’ll undergo an MRI today on his injured ankle, head coach Frank Vogel confirmed after Wednesday’s game.
FEBRUARY 16: X-rays taken after Lakers star Anthony Davis injured his right ankle in tonight’s game were negative, tweets Shams Charania of The Athletic.
Davis will receive treatment during the All-Star break, and his condition will be re-evaluated once the break ends.
