     Winter Storm Warning: Snow arrives Thursday in Michigan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Much to discuss, a Winter Weather Warning is in effect for most of southeast Michigan Thursday morning as we look at up to 8 inches of snow - or more - throughout the day.
The same areas are also under a wind advisory on Wednesday until 8 p.m. and a flood watch until Thursday afternoon.
RELATED: How are the roads in Southeast Michigan?
Rain ends with spotty light freezing rain and sleet around the mid/late morning but a lull in the precipitation very well may take over briefly before snow returns.
It then turns over to snow and it looks like we'll be shoveling a decent amount, with estimates ranging from 4-8 inches.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A winter storm warning is in effect for Metro Detroit through Friday morning due to a possible 4-8 inches -- possibly more -- of snow and ice.
Most of our area south of M-59 will get about 6 inches of snow through the afternoon and evening, with 7-9 inches of snow possible right in the heart of Metro Detroit.

     As a winter storm approaches the Chicago area, snowfall projections are being dialed in as the track of that system begins to take shape.
The HRRR model still shows a fairly significant snowfall for the far southern portions of the Chicago area, along with northwest Indiana, but much smaller totals in the city of Chicago and in the northern and western suburbs.

     A swath of 1,500 miles from western Oklahoma to northern Maine was under some form of winter weather alert, with more 13 million people under a winter storm warning, the National Weather Service said.
A tornado watch was issued for portions of Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi Thursday afternoon, the Weather Service said.
The weather service office in Jackson, Mississippi, predicted gusts up to 60 mph and hail the size of a quarter.
Thursday morning, the storm passed through Dallas, bringing heavy rain and gusty winds but no immediate reports of widespread damage.
"An anomalously warm and moist airmass by mid-February standards will create conditions capable for periods of heavy rain," Weather Service forecasters wrote Thursday morning.
