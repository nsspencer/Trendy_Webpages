     Ryan Zimmerman vs. the Colorado Rockies: A look at the statistics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sep 17, 2021; Washington, District of Columbia, USA; Washington Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman (11) slides into second base ahead of a tag by Colorado Rockies second baseman Brendan Rodgers (7) in the ninth inning at Nationals Park.
Mandatory Credit: Amber Searls-USA TODAY SportsRyan Zimmerman of the Washington Nationals announced his retirement on Tuesday after a 16-year career with the franchise.
During those seasons, Zimmerman had plenty of chances to face Colorado Rockies pitching, so how did he do in his career against Colorado?
While Zimmerman appeared in plenty of games against the Rockies, he also did plenty of damage when he squared off against them.
While Zimmerman didn’t see the Rockies that often, he could certainly be considered a Rockies killer during his time with the Nationals.

The team at Baseball Prospectus unveiled their projections for the (hopefully) upcoming 2022 season and went over PECOTA’s evolution in this iteration.
Britt Ghiroli | The Athletic $: MLB recently argued that minor leaguers should remain unpaid during spring training while requesting the ability to reduce the size of the Domestic Reserve List.
Meanwhile, minor leaguers are taking to social media to show off just how little they’re making.

     Memories of covering Ryan Zimmerman after he announced his retirement...
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     I grew up in Harrisonburg, Virginia, and followed the Cavalier’s program from a distance, but wasn’t familiar with the name listed in Baseball America: Ryan Zimmerman, who announced his retirement yesterday.
I also talked to Zimmerman during spring training in 2011 while doing a story on Mark Reynolds for The Washington Times.
Reynolds and Zimmerman had been teammates at the University of Virginia and in 2011 Reynolds was in his first season with the Orioles.
In the one year he played for Brian O’Connor at Virginia, Reynolds was the shortstop for the Cavs while Zimmerman played third.
Zimmerman would play parts of the next two years, but his march towards retirement probably began on that night in Houston when the Nationals won Game 7.

     Ryan Zimmerman linked generations of D.C. baseball fans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Zimmerman links D.C.’s baseball generations, the Senators of the last century and the Nationals of this one.
When the Senators 2.0 left for Texas in 1971 – the original version moved to Minneapolis in 1961 with an expansion team taking its place -- no one knew if a baseball team would ever return to the District.
Zimmerman began his career at RFK Stadium, where the old Senators also played, where the Redskins had their glory days.
Zimmerman’s career began in the cramped, claustrophobic locker room at RFK.
None will mean as much to D.C. baseball fans because Zimmerman was the first.
