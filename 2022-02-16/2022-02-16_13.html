     Nvidia can’t seem to catch a break.
The chip maker delivered what Wall Street was expecting, and more, when it reported fourth-quarter earnings late Wednesday, and yet the stock is falling.
Nvidia (ticker: NVDA) shares were more than 2% lower in U.S. premarket trading Thursday, having slipped 12% so far this year amid a wider selloff in the...

     Why Nvidia Stock Dropped Today After Record Earnings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     What happenedSpecialty chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) just closed out a record year with its fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 revenue showing strength in several of its target growth markets.
Nvidia shares are down about 16% so far in 2022, including a 7.3% drop today, as of 11 a.m.
Those two segments also both realized record annual sales, growing 61% and 58%, respectively, over the prior year.
While its gaming and data center businesses still dominate, professional visualization -- what CEO Jensen Huang refers to as the omniverse -- more than doubled year over year.
Investors today are thinking that the stock's valuation was based on a more optimistic outlook than that, apparently.

     NVIDIA Stock Post-Earnings: Bears Are Likely Wrong
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While watching CNBC after the closing bell, on February 16, I noticed that NVIDIA stock (NVDA) - Get NVIDIA Corporation Report quickly headed lower by 2% in after hours trading.
And NVIDIA’s growth story is far from over.
Bearish reaction is hard to justifyTo be fair, the market’s bearish reaction to NVIDIA’s earnings report was timid.
NVDA stock did not fall apart: it only failed to gain traction after the company’s business-as-usual, all-round beat that was the 12th consecutive one.
For example, non-GAAP EPS increased nearly three fold between fiscal 2018 and last year, while revenues nearly doubled.

     Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis, who has a buy rating and a $370 price target, said in a note that it’s this ecosystem that drives Nvidia’s moat.
Muse, who has an outperform rating and a $375 price target, also said he expects data center to become dominant.
Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay, who has an outperform rating and a $350 price target, said he believes that Nvidia is even favoring its data center business given demand.
Of the 43 analysts who cover Nvidia, 34 have buy ratings, seven have hold ratings and two have sell ratings.
The average price target as of Wednesday morning was $347.63, compared with a previous $345.87, according to FactSet.
