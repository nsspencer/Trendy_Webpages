     Rick Carlisle: Tristan Thompson to be waived, sign with Bulls
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Indiana Pacers coach Rick Carlisle announced that center Tristan Thompson is going to be waived Thursday in order to sign with the Chicago Bulls.
Carlisle made the surprising declaration Wednesday night, shortly after the recently acquired Thompson scored 17 points in the Pacers’ 113-108 win over Washington.
Thompson came to the Pacers last week as part of the Domantas Sabonis-Tyrese Haliburton trade with the Sacramento Kings.
He’s going to be joining a different team,” Carlisle said.
“He’s going to be waived (Thursday), and he’ll be joining a contending team in the East, a little bit north, if anybody wants to tweet.

     Pacers' Rick Carlisle says Tristan Thompson will sign with Bulls
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle took that adage to another level Wednesday night when, after a 113-108 win over the Wizards, he broke the news that Indiana intends to waive Tristan Thompson Thursday morning, and the 11-year big man will then sign with the Chicago Bulls.
"He's going to be joining a different team," Carlisle said of Thompson, who posted 17 points, six rebounds, one block and shot 8-for-9 in 21 minutes off the bench on Wednesday.
"Known Tristan for years," DeMar DeRozan said of Thompson.
Provided it goes through, the Bulls will need to waive a player to free a roster spot for Thompson.
In Thompson, they are poised to add the most proven frontcourt option on the market.

     Pacers to waive Tristan Thompson, who will sign with Chicago Bulls, says Indiana coach Rick Carlisle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Pacers will waive Tristan Thompson on Thursday, and the veteran big man will sign a deal with the Chicago Bulls, Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said Wednesday night.
In a surprising moment, Carlisle announced the news following the Pacers' 113-108 win against the Washington Wizards in Indianapolis.
Thompson had joined the Pacers last week as part of the blockbuster trade that sent Domantas Sabonis to the Sacramento Kings.
He appeared in four games total for Indiana, with his 17 points against the Wizards on Wednesday night his most since the trade.
"We thanked him for what he's brought for the last six or seven days," Carlisle said.

     Tristan Thompson to Indiana, after four-game stint with Pacers: 'Thank you for everything'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As he leaves to join the Chicago Bulls, veteran big man Tristan Thompson wants the city of Indianapolis and the Indiana Pacers organization to know how much his time there meant to him.
I really appreciate all the love and energy I received from everyone from the organization and the fan base.
It was a "rare instance," Carlisle said, "where you get to thank a guy in the presence of his teammates."
It is understandable that the opportunity to make the postseason would mean even more to Thompson than his connection with Indiana.
Thompson made his Pacers debut last Friday and played a total of 66 minutes in four games with the team.

     How Thompson fits, benefits Bulls' postseason dreams originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoMove past the very unconventional manner in which Tristan Thompson’s imminent signing transpired and the veteran big man is a very conventional playoff player.
Here are three ways the 11-year veteran fits and benefits the Bulls.
His defensive rebounding rate ranks in the 73rd percentile, while his offensive rebounding rate sits in the 96th percentile, per Cleaning the Glass.
The Bulls, as of this writing, own a top-5 defensive rebounding rate but are the second-worst offensive rebounding team in the league.
Thompson has played in 83 playoff games, including 22 NBA Finals contests.

Chicago Bulls get needed frontcourt help by signing Tristan ThompsonSo far, the only player that was a part of that trade between the Kings and Pacers last week that hit the buyout market is Thompson.
The Bulls were seeking help in their frontcourt unit at the trade deadline and didn’t make any moves then.
The Bulls will now have a rejuvenated frontcourt unit after the addition of Thompson once the All-Star Break concludes next week.

He's gonna be waived (Thursday), and he'll be joining a contending team in the East.
Thompson is an 11-year NBA veteran, while Taylor is an undrafted rookie, so Taylor gave Thompson the nod due to age.

(Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)INDIANAPOLIS – A postgame news conference for an NBA game three hours south of Chicago would end up producing some big news for Bulls’ fans even as their game at the United Center was going on.
Pacers coach Rick Carlisle told reporters after their victory over the Wizards at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Wednesday that forward Tristan Thompson will sign with the Bulls after they planned to waive him on Thursday.
The veteran had just joined Indiana after a major trade with the Kings and played in just four contests for the Pacers.
In 34 total games this season, all but three as a reserve, Thompson is averaging 6.3 points and 5.3 rebounds a contest.

     Asked in the post-game press conference about Thompson’s showing, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle took a surprising turn – announcing Thompson would sign with the Bulls.
He’s going to be joining a different team.
Perhaps, Chicago plans to use Thompson at power forward, where injuries have ravaged the Bulls and Patrick Williams remains out.
Maybe he’s pacing himself.
By joining the Eastern Conference’s first-place team, Thompson should get a chance to play in the postseason games he values so highly.
