     Canada reclaims the women’s hockey gold, dethroning the U.S.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     All through the Beijing Games, the unchecked swagger of Canada’s women’s hockey team had been conspicuous for all to see — and to admire, fume over and fear.
There were the humiliations of the teams that would play for the bronze medal, the edgy digs at rivals, the nuanced critiques of the failed strategies to score on Ann-Renée Desbiens, the goaltender who made the Canadian crease a fortress.
The Canadians proved Thursday that all of it was justified: They overpowered the United States in the gold medal game, 3-2, and reclaimed the Olympic crown that the Americans had wrested away four years ago.

     Canada wins Olympic gold in women's hockey, toppling rival Team USAEnlarge this image toggle caption Bruce Bennett/Getty Images Bruce Bennett/Getty ImagesCanada defeated the United States 3-2 in the women's ice hockey final on Thursday, triumphing over its longtime rival — and the defending Olympic champion — to win its fifth gold medal in the sport.
Either Canada or the U.S. has won every gold medal since women's hockey was introduced to the winter Olympics in 1998, with Team USA most recently beating its northern neighbor in the gold medal match at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.
The Americans scored again with just 13 seconds left in the game, but by that point, it was too late.
This is redemption," said Canadian captain Marie-Philip Poulin, who scored two of the game's goals and became the only ice hockey player — male or female — to score in four Olympic Games finals.
Team USA's Hilary Knight, who put her team on the scoreboard during Thursday's game, became the fourth player from the U.S. to win four Olympic Games medals in ice hockey.

     U.S. women’s hockey takes home Olympic silver after losing to rival team Canada
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jumping to an early lead that they never lost, Canada’s women's hockey team defeated the U.S. 3-2 for the gold medal at the Beijing Games on Thursday.
Canada scored three unanswered points in the first and second periods to take the lead — the first by Sarah Nurse, followed by two scored by Marie-Philip Poulin.
Thursday’s win is the fifth Olympic gold for Canada, and its fourth victory over the U.S. in a final game.
The U.S. beat Canada for the gold in 1998 and again in a shootout at the 2018 PyeongChang Games, but Canada won at every other Olympics.
After Thursday’s final at the Beijing Games, a U.S. women’s team has won two golds, four silvers and a bronze in the Olympics.

They had 5:12 of power-play time against the Canadians in the gold-medal game and converted with only 12.5 seconds left in the game and their goalie pulled.
Forward Grace Zumwinkle, misused throughout the tournament, played 6:43.
Even when the Americans lost three straight gold-medal games against Canada, there was a sense they were anyone's games to win.
The gold-medal game in Beijing was the closest Canada has gotten in this rivalry to proving that theory.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Canadian women’s ice hockey team took home gold Thursday morning, after beating their rivals and the reigning Olympic champions: Team USA.
The Canadians, who now have five golds to the Americans’ two, have established themselves as the premier force in women’s hockey — at least for another four years.
Outsports estimated that at least 36 openly LGBTQ athletes, from 14 different countries, are competing in Beijing.
It’s a momentous moment for Ambrose, who failed to make the Olympic team in 2018.
Like the Olympics, and the women’s events in particular, the last women’s World Cup saw an exponential increase in openly LGBTQ players.
