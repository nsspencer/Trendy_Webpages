     Winter Storm Warning issued for Thursday, 6 to 10 inches of snow expected
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     BRANCH COUNTY, MI (WTVB) – The National Weather Service is predicting a second winter storm in two weeks will hit Branch County and the surrounding area.
Forecasters have issued a Winter Storm Warning for Branch, St. Joseph and Hillsdale Counties in Michigan as well as for Steuben County in Indiana from 12:00 noon until midnight on Thursday.
The forecast is calling for mixed precipitation into early afternoon followed by heavy snow with total accumulations of 6 to 10 inches along with ice accumulations of around one tenth of an inch.
Rainfall between one and two inches is expected to fall during this period with times of moderate to heavy rain.
Frozen ground, ice jams, and additional snow pack melt will help lead to increased runoff leading to minor to moderate river flooding and flooding in low lying areas.

     Chicagoland: Winter Weather Advisory North, Winter Storm Warning South
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Movie spoiler: The Snow Track forecast has moved south, and that’s the reason Arlington Heights and surrounding northwest suburbs have transformed from a Winter Storm Watch to a Winter Weather Advisory, and not a Winter Storm Warning.
However, Bolingbrook, Plainfield, Joliet and areas south in Chicagoland have been upgraded to a Winter Storm Warning.
The highest winds are forecast for central and south Chicagoland compared to north Chicagoland.
That, plus the anticipated light nature of any wintry precipitation, NWS Chicago favored going with an Winter Weather Advisory vs Winter Storm Warning for this north corridor.
Breezy, with a south southwest wind 15 to 20 mph becoming west southwest 10 to 15 mph in the evening.
