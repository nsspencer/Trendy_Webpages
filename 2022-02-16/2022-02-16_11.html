     Canada reclaims the women’s hockey gold, dethroning the U.S.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     All through the Beijing Games, the unchecked swagger of Canada’s women’s hockey team had been conspicuous for all to see — and to admire, fume over and fear.
There were the humiliations of the teams that would play for the bronze medal, the edgy digs at rivals, the nuanced critiques of the failed strategies to score on Ann-Renée Desbiens, the goaltender who made the Canadian crease a fortress.
The Canadians proved Thursday that all of it was justified: They overpowered the United States in the gold medal game, 3-2, and reclaimed the Olympic crown that the Americans had wrested away four years ago.

     BEIJING — After the United States' third game of group play during the 2022 Winter Olympics, goaltender Alex Cavallini hinted at obstacles that almost prevented her from participating in the Beijing Games.
Asked to elaborate, Cavallini replied on Feb. 6: "We'll talk after the Olympics."
Cavallini, 30, made her Olympic debut against Switzerland, Team USA's third game of the tournament.

"For (the coaches) to believe in me and ride me through was really something truly special," Cavallini said.

     Canada wins Olympic gold in women's hockey, toppling rival Team USAEnlarge this image toggle caption Bruce Bennett/Getty Images Bruce Bennett/Getty ImagesCanada defeated the United States 3-2 in the women's ice hockey final on Thursday, triumphing over its longtime rival — and the defending Olympic champion — to win its fifth gold medal in the sport.
Either Canada or the U.S. has won every gold medal since women's hockey was introduced to the winter Olympics in 1998, with Team USA most recently beating its northern neighbor in the gold medal match at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.
The Americans scored again with just 13 seconds left in the game, but by that point, it was too late.
This is redemption," said Canadian captain Marie-Philip Poulin, who scored two of the game's goals and became the only ice hockey player — male or female — to score in four Olympic Games finals.
Team USA's Hilary Knight, who put her team on the scoreboard during Thursday's game, became the fourth player from the U.S. to win four Olympic Games medals in ice hockey.

     U.S. women’s hockey takes home Olympic silver after losing to rival team Canada
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jumping to an early lead that they never lost, Canada’s women's hockey team defeated the U.S. 3-2 for the gold medal at the Beijing Games on Thursday.
Canada scored three unanswered points in the first and second periods to take the lead — the first by Sarah Nurse, followed by two scored by Marie-Philip Poulin.
Thursday’s win is the fifth Olympic gold for Canada, and its fourth victory over the U.S. in a final game.
The U.S. beat Canada for the gold in 1998 and again in a shootout at the 2018 PyeongChang Games, but Canada won at every other Olympics.
After Thursday’s final at the Beijing Games, a U.S. women’s team has won two golds, four silvers and a bronze in the Olympics.

     For more than three years, the U.S. women’s hockey team worked to repeat as gold medal winners at the Beijing Olympics.
They won a gold medal.
Asked why she came back, Desbiens (38 saves) looked down at her gold medal.
Then 18, Poulin scored the game-winning goal in the 2010 gold medal game and did the same four years later.
It didn't result in a gold medal, though, and doesn’t make the loss any less painful.

     Nurse set the single Olympic tournament record with 18 points.
Gold medallists Canada celebrated during the victory ceremony of the women's ice hockey competition during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games.
She was in the penalty box for tripping when Kessel scored in the closing seconds — but only after Desbiens stopped the first five shots she faced during the power play.
“She showed up in those big moments,” Poulin said of Desbiens, who quit hockey after 2018 before being coaxed into rejoining the team.
“It’s great to know that this team has gone through a lot and we’re able to pull out a win.”

     US women’s hockey gets silver, but won’t stop fighting for future of sport
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     BEIJING — When it was over, when another edition of the fiercest and most frenetic rivalry at these (or any) 2022 Winter Olympics was filed away in the history books, the misty-eyed, muscle-sapped players of the United States women’s hockey team waited.
It is about skaters on both sides of the border banding together to form the Professional Women’s Hockey Players Association in the hunt for equality.
“I know there’s a lot of young girls watching back home, and I hope women’s hockey cannot be silent after these two weeks,” Coyne Schofield said.
We need to continue to push for visibility, we need to continue to fight for women’s hockey, because it’s not good enough.
Here’s to hoping the wait is much shorter for women’s hockey to get what it deserves.

     Never had the United States been dominated like this so early in a gold medal game — and never had it dug so deep to climb back just to give itself a chance.
American players on the bench continued to crank their necks up at the scoreboard clock, watching as the seconds ticked down on their dreams of winning a second consecutive gold medal.
Marie-Philip Poulin was the one to tap it home for her second of the game, seventh in Olympic gold medal games all-time.
Poulin has been unthinkably clutch in her Olympic career, and that goal was her sixth in gold medal games alone.
