     Champions League 2022: Top Scorers After Wednesday's Round-of-16 Leg 1 Results
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AP Photo/Alexandra BeierTwo entertaining Champions League matches went down during round-of-16 action Wednesday.
Eight minutes after Firmino's game-winner, Mohamed Salah scored his eighth Champions League goal in just seven appearances after firing a low shot for the 2-0 advantage.
Here's a look at this year's latest Champions League top-scorers list after Salah's effort.
That's largely thanks to 20-year-old substitute Chukwubuike Adamu, who scored his first-ever Champions League goal in the 21st minute:A win wasn't meant to be for FC Salzburg, which was making its Champions League round-of-16 debut.
However, all is not lost for the Austrian side, which will visit Bayern Munich for the second leg on March 8.

The 21-year-old USMNT playmaker capped a brilliant Champions League display for RB Salzburg with an assist in their 1-1 draw with Bayern Munich.
The assist was perhaps a little lucky as it seemed as though Aaronson miscontrolled Karim Adeyemi's pass perfectly into Adamu's path.
If deliberate, it was one of the most stylish and ingenious passes ever witnessed on the Champions League stage.
Brenden Aaronson had an excellent game as RB Salzburg went toe-to-toe with Bayern Munich IMAGO/David GeiereggerAaronson was singled out for praise by France legend Thierry Henry in the CBS studio.

     Mo Salah strikes to cap Liverpool late show against Inter Milan in Champions League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Amidst all the talk of Liverpool's new age stars, it was two of the club's long-time heroes that delivered a late smash and grab raid in the first leg of the Champions League last-16 tie against Inter Milan on Wednesday.
As 18-year-old Harvey Elliot made his European debut and new signing Luis Diaz came on as a second-half substitute, goals from Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah in the final 15 minutes fired Liverpool to a 2-0 victory at the San Siro.
Forced to weather a strong start to the second-half by the reigning Serie A champion, Liverpool scored with their first and only shots on target to take a commanding lead back to Anfield on March 8.
Having already held the title of the Premier League's youngest ever debutant, Elliot became Liverpool's youngest ever player to start a European fixture -- excluding qualifiers -- and at times looked unnerved at the center of a raucous San Siro atmosphere.
Firmino heads Liverpool into the lead with a superb header.

     The Rapids open their season in the first leg of the Concacaf Round of 16 against Comunicaciones, the Guatemalan champions, at 5 p.m. Thursday at Estadio Doroteo Guamuch Flores in Guatemala City.
But Rapids head coach Robin Fraser believes this group has a different mindset.
But the club has shown some holes in league play recently, giving up 11 goals while scoring 18 in seven games.
“We know that they’re a good team,” Fraser said.
“As you develop throughout your career, you have to switch from the national team back to club,” Kaye said.

     Champions League: Defensive worries remain for Bayern Munich despite 90th-minute equalizer at Salzburg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Bayern Munich denied Red Bull Salzburg what would have been an historic victory in their UEFA Champions League round of 16 first leg tie on Wednesday with a late equalizer which barely papers over the cracks exhibited by the German giants at present.
Ultimately, Julian Nagelsmann's side denied Matthias Jaissle's men what would have been an impressive victory but in many ways, this feels like another defeat for Bayern after their surprise Bundesliga reverse against VfL Bochum over the weekend.
The Polish superstar was powerless in Austria, though, without a single shot.
In fact, rewind to late 2021 and SL Benfica, FC Augsburg and Borussia Dortmund all scored more than once against Bayern while SC Freiburg, Dynamo Kyiv and Mainz 05 also spoiled clean sheets for the German juggernaut.
Salzburg pulling off this sort of result should come as no surprise given their recent continental development but the fact that Bayern could still be their next victims should be of minimal shock too given their deterioration at the back this campaign.
