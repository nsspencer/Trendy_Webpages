     Hoosier Nick Goepper Claims Silver In Slopestyle Skiing At Beijing Olympics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     BEIJING — Nick Goepper, a native of Lawrenceburg, Indiana, was on the back half of a 1-2 finish for Team USA in the slopestyle skiing event at the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing.
Goepper, who was the defending silver medalist from the Pyeongchang games in 2018, hoped to claim gold but came up short to fellow American Alexander Hall in the slopestyle skiing final to claim his second straight silver medal in the event.
Goepper, 27, was also the bronze medalist in slopestyle skiing from the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.
Goepper recorded an 86.48 on his second run, which had him doing a switch double bio 1260 and a rightside double cork 1440, also two extremely difficult tricks.
The two medals for the United States in slopestyle skiing have vaulted Team USA into third in the overall medal count with 19 total medals, behind Germany (20) and Norway (21).

     Beijing Winter Olympics: Indiana skier Nick Goepper wins silver medal in slopestyle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Hall won gold and Goepper silver at Genting Snow Park on Wednesday, extending the United States’ success in this event.
Another Lawrenceburg freeskier, Justin Schoenefeld, earlier became Indiana's first gold medalist at a Winter Olympics in mixed team aerials.
He won bronze in 2014 as part of the U.S. sweep – with gold medalist Joss Christensen and silver medalist Gus Kenworthy – before winning silver in Pyeongchang.
But it really is because every year people are doing bigger and better tricks,” Goepper said.
On his last jump, Hall hit a double cork 1080 but pretzeled it – or basically rewound the spin – 180 degrees before landing.

     Skiing with soul, Hall, Goepper go 1-2 in Olympic slopestyle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Every bit as important to American slopestyle skiers Alex Hall and Nick Goepper: They did it their way.
Hall and Goepper took a gamble by being different Wednesday with a pair of high-stakes runs over an Olympic course that was built for taking chances.
Goepper took silver.
One key detail: Where most skiers fly high off that jump, Hall never got more than 3 feet off the ground.
Goepper took silver in 2018.

     When slopestyle skiers went one way, Alex Hall went the other, and found gold
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As he launched, Hall tried a trick calls a “pretzel” — he started to spin in one direction, then somehow, in midair, twisted back toward the other direction while completing a 900 rotation.
“That’s why I love skiing, with the different ways you can approach it and the creativity,” said the 23-year-old Hall.
He tried tricks in snowy backyards, and eventually, started wandering the world looking for different environments to hone his craft.
He definitely had different ideas for his rail run, then different ideas for his jump run.
But he was still nearly four points behind Hall, whose second run of 86.38 also would have been good enough for a medal, underscoring the consistency and originality with which he skied.
