     Frank Pesce, 'Beverly Hills Cop' and 'Top Gun' actor, dies at 75
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Frank Pesce, a character actor who appeared in the first two “Beverly Hills Cop” movies, “Top Gun,” “Midnight Run” and “Miami Vice,” died on Feb. 6 due to dementia complications.
Born in 1946 in New York City, Pesce’s circle of friends included Sylvester Stallone, Tony Danza and Robert Forster, among others.
Pesce starred in the movie as his real-life older brother Vito, while Dan Aiello played his father and Anthony LaPaglia starred as Frank.
David Permut, who produced the film, said of Pesce: “To say Frank was one of a kind would be a gross understatement.
He claimed to see more movies than Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert combined.”Along with Scher, Pesce is survived by his brother, Vito Pesce; nieces Vanessa Pesce and Danielle Pesce; and sister-in-law Catherine Pesce.
