     Talks of Aaron Rodgers potentially suiting up as a member of the Denver Broncos this coming season are beginning to heat up.
As the back-to-back league MVP weighs his options regarding his NFL future, Bovada Sportsbook has the odds of him taking over as the Broncos’ next QB at (+100).

The Broncos have been floated as a potential landing spot for Rodgers since he first began airing his grievances with his current Green Bay organization last year.
I say no, Green Bay as always.

     Former Packers Executive Points Out Difference With Aaron Rodgers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Over the past few days, rumors have emerged about a potential contract offer from the Green Bay Packers to quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
While that would be a massive offer from the team, one former Packers executive noticed a change in language between this offseason and the 2021 offseason.
Former Packers executive Andrew Brandt pointed out that last offseason, the team made it clear they wouldn’t be trading Rodgers.
“In 2021 the Packers said ‘we are not trading Aaron Rodgers’ … in 2022 it’s ‘we want to make him highest paid QB’ … that’s different,” Brandt said.
These are not the Rams; they are the ‘Draft and Develop’ Packers.”Brandt obviously believes that the Packers and Rodgers might be headed in separate directions.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Actress Shailene Woodley and NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers have ended their one-year engagement, after months of rumors and speculation regarding their status.
Rodgers, 38, and Woodley, 30, began dating in July 2020, after Rodgers split from his girlfriend of two years, NASCAR driver Danica Patrick.
After a year of dating, Rodgers and Woodley announced their engagement in February 2021, saying they had been engaged for months.
Fans began to suspect the couple had split when Shailene was photographed surfing in Malibu without her ring back in October.
More recently, Aaron failed to mention Shailene in his NFL Honors speech on Feb. 10, where he was named MVP; nor was Shailene in attendance at the ceremony.

     The NFL legend took to Twitter this week to clarify that he was not the reason for the breakup.
After spending his entire Hall of Fame career with the Bears, the 79-year-old seems to have found a new favorite pastime and that pastime is tweeting.
Not only did he send out that Rodgers tweet, but he also recently made fun of the Jets.
Butkus also seems to especially love taking shots at Rodgers, who once said that he "owns" the Bears.
As for Rodgers' relationship with Woodley, it seems to have ended almost as quietly as it started.

     (CNN) Shailene Woodley and Aaron Rodgers have called off their engagement, a source close to Woodley told CNN.
"They grew apart, both have busy careers and unfortunately their relationship took a backseat.
Their break up comes nearly one year after Woodley's interview with Jimmy Fallon in which she confirmed that she was planning to wed the football star.
"Yes, we are engaged," Woodley said.
Everybody right now is freaking out over it and we're like, 'Yeah, we've been engaged for a while.'"

     Broncos legend Terrell Davis believes Aaron Rodgers will choose Denver as his next landing spot — if the quarterback decides to return for an 18th NFL season.
“I’ve heard from too many insiders, too many sources, it makes too much sense for us not to get Aaron Rodgers.
I’m not saying that was the reason, but it helps,” Davis said.
Hackett worked with Rodgers as an offensive coordinator for the Packers from 2019-2021, before Denver hired him last month.
Terrell Davis is convinced Aaron Rodgers is coming to Denver.

     GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Watch quarterback Aaron Rodgers’ speech when he accepted the MVP award on Saturday night and you might conclude one thing about his future with the Green Bay Packers.
While the Packers wait for Rodgers to decide, they’ve taken every opportunity to make it clear they want him back.
By making it abundantly clear they want Rodgers to finish his career with the Packers, they effectively shifted the burden to him.
Aaron Rodgers' future is one of the biggest storylines of the offseason, and the only thing that's certain is that if he does walk away, it won't be a bitter split.
“I was obviously frustrated about some things in the offseason,” Rodgers said.

El gerente general Brian Gutekunst era un visor de área en el tiempo, pero trabajó bajó el entonces gerente general Ted Thompson.
Thompson y Murphy se convirtieron en enemigos público N° 1a y N° 1b en el verano de 2008.

     Packers hiring key coach to make Aaron Rodgers happy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Green Bay Packers enter an interesting offseason, as there are multiple questions surrounding the state of the roster.
One of which is the situation involving Aaron Rodgers.
According to Aaron Wilson, the packers have hired Tom Clements as the new quarterback coach.
He’s a veteran assistant coach in the league and has the experience necessary to coach Aaron Rodgers and Jordan Love simultaneously.
Remaining with Green Bay makes sense for Aaron Rodgers, but so does leaving.
