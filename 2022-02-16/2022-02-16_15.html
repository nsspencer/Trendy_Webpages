     Sources -- Derrick Rose in line to rejoin New York Knicks after All-Star break
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After missing two months due to an ankle injury, there's optimism guard Derrick Rose will return to the New York Knicks' lineup out of the All-Star Break next week, sources told ESPN on Wednesday.
Rose has been progressing on the court for a return, and barring setbacks, there's confidence he'll be ready to face the Miami Heat on Feb. 25, when the Knicks resume the season's stretch run with hopes of reaching the play-in tournament, sources said.
Rose told reporters on Jan. 30 that he hoped to return "a little after (the) All-Star" break, and that timetable remains firmly on course, sources said.

     Knicks Takeaways from 2022 NBA Trade Deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     0 of 3David Dow/Getty ImagesHeading up to the 2022 NBA trade deadline, the New York Knicks seemed like they could buy or sell.
In the end, they did nothing, brokering only a mid-January swap that sent out a first-round pick and brought in Cam Reddish, who has some promise but apparently not enough polish for head coach Tom Thibodeau's liking.
When offered an opportunity to gain ground or threatened with bottoming out, they hovered between both (though come much closer to the latter than the former).
This isn't the sequel Knicks fans had hoped to see after last season's playoff breakthrough, but here they are.
What does a smoke-filled, fire-free deadline tell us about this team?

     Here's What Tom Thibodeau Said After The Knicks Lost To The Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New York Knicks lost to the Brooklyn Nets 111-106 on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden.
During the game they had a 28-point lead that they let slip away, and in the fourth quarter they were outscored by the Nets 38-19.
The loss dropped the Knicks to 25-34 on the season, and they are currently the 12th seed in the Eastern Conference.
They have lost three games in a row, and are just 2-8 in their last ten games overall.
Last year they were the fourth seed in the east with a 41-31 record.

     Knicks front-office may have made a massive mistake with Mitchell Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New York Knicks held on for dear life at the trade deadline on February 10, failing to unload any big contracts and acquire more assets for the future.
One player, the Knicks, received calls about was center Mitchell Robinson, who fouled out against the Brooklyn Nets in a devastating defeat after holding a 28 point lead at one point in the game.
Marc Berman of the NY Post reported that the Knicks could lose Mitchell Robinson in free agency:Four teams went after Knicks center Mitchell Robinson at Thursday’s trade deadline, including the Bulls and Pistons, according to an NBA source.
The Knicks’ decision to not trade Robinson for assets shows they at least feel Robinson would accept a contract extension if one is offered.
If the Knicks really allow Mitch to walk without offering him an extension following the end of the season, they will have made a massive mistake.

     The New York Knicks are in freefall, and, according to SNY's Ian Begley, 2021 Coach of the Year Tom Thibodeau doesn't have the support within the organization that he used to.
More specifically, according to a second SNY story on the subject, Knicks executive William Wesley -- "Worldwide Wes" -- has criticized Thibodeau's coaching in private conversations with owner James Dolan.
Wesley has told Dolan that Thibodeau deserves a significant share of the blame for the team's recent slide, per SNY.
The Knicks lost 127-123 to the Oklahoma City Thunder in overtime at home on Monday, despite having a double-digit lead in the third quarter.
(The Thunder entered the game having lost 17 of 21 games and were without Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Lu Dort.)

     NEW YORK (AP) — The Brooklyn Nets aren’t sure when Kevin Durant can come back or how soon Kyrie Irving might be able to play in New York.
The rookie led Brooklyn back from a 28-point deficit with 16 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, and the Nets beat the New York Knicks 111-106 on Wednesday night.
Julius Randle had 31 points and 10 rebounds in perhaps the most embarrassing loss of a disappointing season for the Knicks.
“You get a big lead, you’ve got to play tough with a lead,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said.
