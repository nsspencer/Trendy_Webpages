Team USA had been one minute away from advancing to the Olympic semifinals — but Slovakia came back to force overtime in the final minute of regulation.
The U.S. team, which like other countries lacks NHL stars, is the youngest squad the U.S. has sent to the Olympics in decades, with an average age around 25.

     The Canadian and U.S. women’s ice hockey teams face off Wednesday in the Olympic finals, looking to settle the score on one of the world’s biggest sports rivalries for another four years.
Outsports estimated that at least 36 openly LGBTQ athletes, from 14 different countries, are competing in Beijing.
Last year, at the Summer Games in Tokyo, there were an estimated, record-breaking 186 openly LGBTQ Olympians.
Like the Olympics, and the women’s events in particular, the last women’s World Cup saw an exponential increase in openly LGBTQ players.
The Beijing Olympics women’s hockey final starts on Wednesday at 11:10 p.m.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The action was fast, the players were exhausted, and with so much room on the ice, every change felt fraught.
Somehow, neither team scored.
These Olympics have not captured the American imagination like most do, for a variety of reasons, but there would have been an opening for this hockey team.
The Americans were more like that 1980 team than any team in an NHL-infused Olympics could ever be.
Instead, there were two Slovakian goals, a slew of missed American chances and no more hockey for the U.S. men to play.

     Ice hockey: US men suffer shootout defeat to Slovakia at Winter Olympics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The United States’ improbable, unbeaten run through the Olympic men’s ice hockey tournament came to a devastating halt at the quarter-final stage on Wednesday with a 3-2 penalty shootout defeat to Slovakia.
The youngest US men’s Olympic team in decades appeared bound for the semi-finals after coming from behind for a third straight contest to lead 2-1 with under a minute remaining.
“They played outstanding this entire tournament,” USA defenseman and alternate captain Steven Kampfer said of the college players who made up more than half of the team’s roster.
Team USA players look on after their defeat.
Only Cehlarik managed to find the back of the net in the best-of-five shootout as Rybar turned away all five American attempts.
