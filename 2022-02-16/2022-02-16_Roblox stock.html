     Why Roblox Stock Crashed Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     What happenedShares of Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) plunged 26% on Wednesday after the game development company reported disappointing fourth-quarter results.
Still, growth in the video game platform's bookings, which equates to the amount of virtual currency users bought during the quarter, continued to decelerate.
Bookings rose 20%, compared to 28% in the third quarter and 35% in the second quarter.
The company said its revenue growth slowed to roughly 65% in January, while its bookings rose just 2% to 3%.
So it's possible that Roblox's slowing growth rates are now reflected in its fallen stock price.
