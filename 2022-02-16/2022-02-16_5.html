     Judge blocks release of additional records in Bob Saget death investigation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) A Florida judge on Wednesday granted a temporary injunction blocking the release of additional records related to the death investigation of actor and comedian Bob Saget.
The judge's decision comes after Saget's family filed a lawsuit Tuesday to block the release of certain records, citing privacy concerns, as CNN previously reported.
The Orange County Medical Examiner's Office determined that his death was accidental, most likely due to him falling backward and striking his head.
"In the process of these investigations, Defendants created records which include photographs, video recordings, audio recordings, statutorily protected autopsy information, and all other statutorily protected information," the lawsuit stated.
"Upon information and belief, some of these Records graphically depict Mr. Saget, his likeness or features, or parts of him, and were made by Defendants during Defendants' investigations."

     Judge temporarily blocks release of records from Bob Saget's death investigation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Florida judge has granted the family of Bob Saget a temporary injunction to block the release of records from the investigation of his sudden death, court documents show.
The chief medical examiner for Orange and Osceola counties said that the manner of death was an accident.
"Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm in the form of extreme mental pain, anguish, and emotional distress if Defendants release the Records in response to public records requests or otherwise disseminate the Records for any other reason or purpose," the lawsuit stated.
The family's complaint contends that media outlets have filed or plan to file public records requests seeking the release of the records and argues that no "legitimate public interest would be served" by their release.
On Wednesday, Circuit Court Judge Vincent Chiu granted the temporary injunction that bars the sheriff and medical examiner's office from releasing any of Saget’s death records.

     Judge blocks release of Bob Saget’s autopsy records for now
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Circuit Judge Vincent Chiu issued the temporary injunction, saying that Saget’s family would suffer “severe mental pain, anguish, and emotional distress” if the request wasn’t granted.
During the course of the autopsy and death investigation, the medical examiner’s office and sheriff’s office created graphic videos and photos of Saget’s body, as well as audio recordings.
“Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm in the form of extreme mental pain, anguish, and emotional distress if Defendants release the Records in response to public records requests or otherwise disseminate the records for any other reason or purpose,” their complaint said.
However, “upon a showing of good cause,” a court can allow the records to be viewed or copied under the supervision of the records’ custodian.
“No legitimate public interest would be served by the release or dissemination of the records to the public,” said the lawsuit by Saget’s family.

     Judge Temporarily Blocks Release of Records Related to Bob Saget’s Death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A Florida judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the release of certain medical records regarding Bob Saget’s death.
On Tuesday, Saget’s family sued to keep private certain medical documents related to the comedian’s death.
Media outlets have already filed or plan to file public records requests to obtain documents from the autopsy, according to the lawsuit.
Photos, videos and audio recordings of an autopsy held by a medical examiner are already confidential and exempt from disclosure, according to Florida statutes relating to death investigation records.
Orange County medical examiner Joshua Stephany has ruled Saget’s death an accident.
