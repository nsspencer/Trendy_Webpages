     Trey Songz sued again for alleged sexual assault, accuses plaintiff’s lawyer of witness tampering

     Trey Songz on behalf of a woman who claims he raped her at a 2016 party in Los Angeles, NBC reports.
ADVERTISEMENT"After entering the bedroom, Trey Songz turned, almost immediately, into a savage rapist,” the suit alleges.
“Trey Songz threw Plaintiff Jane Doe to the ground, ripped Plaintiff Jane Doe’s pants off, pinned Plaintiff Jane Doe down face first and forced Defendant Trey Songz’ penis into Plaintiff’s anus without Plaintiff Jane Doe’s consent."
Neverson's attorney filed a motion yesterday to dismiss that case yesterday, accusing Mitchell of offering an unnamed witness at least $100,000 to corroborate Jeffries' claims.
"Trey Songz has a sordid history of attacking women, which now includes myself."

     Trey Songz Accused of Raping Woman at L.A. Party in $20 Million Lawsuit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Trey looks forward to having the facts fully aired," a rep for Songz told TMZ in a statement about the $20 million lawsuit.
"Earlier today, the attorney who drafted this suit was credibly accused of trying to pay a woman to falsely accuse Trey.
Prior to the incident, the woman described her relationship with Songz (whose real name is Tremaine Neverson) as one that was "casual and occasionally sexual."
While at the party, the woman says she obliged his request to join him upstairs because she believed they "would have consensual sex…as they previously have had."
