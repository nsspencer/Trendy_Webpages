     Sha’Carri Richardson, Tara Lipinski, Johnny Weir and others push back at doping decision leniency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     U.S. sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson first shocked the world after winning the 100-meter dash in last summer's Olympic trials.
The Russian Olympic Committee later won gold but were not awarded their medals due to Valieva's positive test.
Before and during the women's singles short program on Tuesday, former ice skaters and commentators Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski agreed that Valieva should not be allowed to skate.
Lipinski, who won gold in the 1998 Nagano Olympics, added that the decision is "putting a permanent scar on our sport."
Former figure skaters Adam Rippon, Yuna Kim, Scott Moir and Kaitlyn Weaver have also expressed their disapproval with the decision.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Typically NBC’s Olympic skating analysts Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir never stop talking.
While Gannon treads a middle ground, Lipinski and Weir did notWhen Valieva was done, she broke down in tears.
“We have to remind ourselves that she is just 15 years old, a minor, and I know more than any what it’s like to compete in an Olympic Games at 15 years old, but a positive test is a positive test.
She cannot skate.”Not only did Valieva skate, she skated well, and is in first placeBut she could, and she did — exceptionally well.
And some thought Lipinski and Weir were abandoning their responsibilities as the high-profile faces of NBC during the highest-profile competition at the Winter Games.

     Johnny Weir And Tara Lipinski Made Their Feelings About Kamila Valieva Being Allowed To Skate At The Olympics Known During NBC's Broadcast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     If you’ve watched Olympic figure skating anytime recently, you're likely very familiar with Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski and their announcing dynamic.
But during Russian skater Kamila Valieva’s skate, there was definitely more of a somber tone, and at the end, they did not hold back their feelings.
Over the last couple of days, figure skating has been caught up in a brouhaha as results of a drug test taken by 15-year-old women’s figure skater Kamila Valieva came to light.
She’d failed a drug test back in December after trimetazidine was found in her system, a drug that has been known to help with endurance.

     There’s no question who most Americans think are the authorities on figure skating in America, and it’s a pair of Olympic medalists in Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir.
As known for their chemistry on-screen as well as their commentary, they have found a terrific balance in how to deal with the unprecedented situation involving Russian skater and gold medal favorite Kamila ValievaTara Lipinski and Johnny Weir weigh in on Kamila Valiyeva's short program.
Lipinski going on to acknowledge Valieva’s undeniable talent is also the right thing to do.
Valieva isn’t even competing for Russia because of the largest state-sponsored pattern of systematic doping in the history of organized sport.
Both Lipinski and Weir hit the mark perfectly here.

     Figure skater Kamila Valieva controversially took the ice Tuesday for the women’s single short program at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, despite the 15-year-old Russian’s positive test for a banned substance days earlier.
Valieva’s presence in the event drew the ire of NBC commentators and former figure skaters Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir, who criticized the International Olympic Committee’s decision to allow Valieva to compete.
Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir weigh in on Kamila Valiyeva's short program.
“Can we get a solid answer on the difference [between] her situation and mine?” Richardson tweeted.
“My mother died and I can’t run and was also favored to place top 3.
