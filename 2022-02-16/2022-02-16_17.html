     Report: Bayern Munich seeking defensive leader and attacking right-back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Bayern Munich backline — whether it is a back-four or back-three — has lacked cohesion for most of the season.
Neither Benjamin Pavard nor Dayot Upamecano has played well enough to warrant such a role and neither is overly vocal anyway.
So, what Bayern Munich is missing is that one commanding personality to be the face of the defense.
Bayern Munich has been linked to both Chelsea FC’s Antonio Rüdiger and Juventus’ Matthias de Ligt, who are both known as leaders, but neither looks like a realistic option.
In addition, kicker stated that Bayern Munich is also looking for an offensive-minded right-back to play opposite of Davies.

     Brenden Aaronson on Champions League assist against Bayern Munich

     Brenden Aaronson Bursts With Pride After First Champions League Assist Against Bayern MunichBrenden Aaronson produced one of the best performances of his fledgling career in his highest-profile game yet on Wednesday night.
The 21-year-old USMNT playmaker capped a brilliant Champions League display for RB Salzburg with an assist in their 1-1 draw with Bayern Munich.
The assist was perhaps a little lucky as it seemed as though Aaronson miscontrolled Karim Adeyemi's pass perfectly into Adamu's path.
If deliberate, it was one of the most stylish and ingenious passes ever witnessed on the Champions League stage.
Brenden Aaronson had an excellent game as RB Salzburg went toe-to-toe with Bayern Munich IMAGO/David GeiereggerAaronson was singled out for praise by France legend Thierry Henry in the CBS studio.

     Report: Julian Nagelsmann unhappy with Bayern Munich’s transfer strategy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stop us if you have heard this before: A Bayern Munich coach is getting frustrated with the club’s transfer policy.
According to a report from Sport Bild’s Christian Falk (as captured by Twitter account @iMiaSanMia), Julian Nagelsmann is starting to become frustrated with Bayern Munich’s transfer policy and the overall lack of moves.
Sport1 also issued a report stating similar information:According to SPORT1 information, Nagelsmann is not satisfied with the depth of his squad.
“In the end, you can create friction in the team yourself by being on the transfer market,” says Nagelsmann.
If Nagelsmann and Salihamidzic cannot get aligned and things eventually do start to get combative, this could become an all too familiar theme for the coach-sporting director relationship.
