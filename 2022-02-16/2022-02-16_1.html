The doodle, illustrated by Tatsuro Kiuchi, a Tokyo-based artist, depicts Dr Takahashi looking through his microscope, and putting a bandaid on a child’s arm.
His chickenpox vaccine, named ‘Oka’, was developed in 1974 and subsequently approved by the World Health Organization.
In 1994, Dr Takahashi was appointed the director of the Microbial Disease study Group at Osaka University.
Dr Michiaki Takahashi died in 2013 of a cardiac arrest.

     A look at the life and work of Michiaki Takahashi, the scientist that developed the chickenpox vaccine.
Japanese scientist Michiaki Takahashi, renowned for the development of the varicella vaccine, would have been 94 years old on February 17.
“I realised then that I should use my knowledge of viruses to develop a chickenpox vaccine,” he told the Financial Times.
Still, his interest in developing a chickenpox vaccine did not diminish, and he started his project in 1970.
The varicella vaccine was developed by using the VZV isolated from the vesicular fluid of a child with typical varicella.

     GoogleThursday’s Google Doodle honors virologist Michiaki Takahashi, who developed the first vaccine against chickenpox.
He’d become one of millions of kids in the U.S. who (until 1995) got sick with chickenpox every year.
The chickenpox vaccine became available in Japan in 1986 and in the U.S. in 1995.
Yes, The Vaccine WorksNo vaccine offers perfect, impenetrable protection from illness, but a good vaccine can dramatically shift the odds in a person’s favor.
By 2005, 10 years after the U.S. introduced the chickenpox vaccine, chickenpox cases nationwide had dropped by about 90%.
