     See the average tax refund as filing season gets off to ‘good start,’ IRS says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 2021 tax filing season is off to “a good start,” the IRS said, as it processes recently submitted tax returns and attempts to cut through a backlog from the 2020 tax year.
So far, the agency has processed 12.99 million of the 16.68 million returns it has received since the 2021 season started on Jan. 24.
Of those, 4.46 million have resulted in refunds that average $2,306, compared to last year’s average of $2,800, the IRS said.
When those families file their 2021 returns, they will receive the other half of the credit rather than the full credit.
The 2021 tax filing deadline is April 18, and more than 160 million individual returns are expected to be filed.

     FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans in a Wednesday letter called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to ensure Americans receive their tax refunds in a "timely" manner and modernize its processing systems.
"Despite its reliance on decades-old legacy technology systems and the fact that the majority of IRS workers continue to telework remotely, Americans expect their tax returns to be processed in a timely and efficient manner," the Republicans wrote.
"[A]mericans rely on the IRS to process tax returns in a timely manner."

     Later, Jack and Jill are married in 2020, and the couple files its first joint income tax return.

After property is segregated as either separate or community property, community property is broken down further into either sole management property or joint management property.
Texas law further defines the rights of creditors vis-à-vis separate property, sole management property, and joint management property.
Under Medaris, the IRS may offset $375 of the income tax withholding attributable to Anne’s wages and $125 of the income tax withholding attributable to Tom’s wages.
