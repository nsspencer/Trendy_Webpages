     Inter Milan vs Liverpool live score and result updates: Champions League latest as Salah and Firmino secure win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Liverpool took a step towards the quarter-finals of the Champions League after beating Inter Milan 2-0 at San Siro.
Inter almost took the lead through Hakan Calhanoglu, but his thumping strike from close-range struck the bar after 16 minutes.
Liverpool took the lead against the run of play 15 minutes from time.
Liverpool doubled their lead eight minutes later as Mohamed Salah’s deflected shot found the back of the net.
Jurgen Klopp’s side will go into the second leg at Anfield in a fortnight with a healthy advantage as they look to repeat their Champions League triumph in 2019.

     Mo Salah strikes to cap Liverpool late show against Inter Milan in Champions League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Amidst all the talk of Liverpool's new age stars, it was two of the club's long-time heroes that delivered a late smash and grab raid in the first leg of the Champions League last-16 tie against Inter Milan on Wednesday.
As 18-year-old Harvey Elliot made his European debut and new signing Luis Diaz came on as a second-half substitute, goals from Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah in the final 15 minutes fired Liverpool to a 2-0 victory at the San Siro.
Forced to weather a strong start to the second-half by the reigning Serie A champion, Liverpool scored with their first and only shots on target to take a commanding lead back to Anfield on March 8.
Having already held the title of the Premier League's youngest ever debutant, Elliot became Liverpool's youngest ever player to start a European fixture -- excluding qualifiers -- and at times looked unnerved at the center of a raucous San Siro atmosphere.
Firmino heads Liverpool into the lead with a superb header.

     Liverpool's win at Inter says plenty about club's depth, character
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Liverpool wasn't at its fluent best and was at times challenged by Inter, but a 2–0 result in Milan was earned by a squad that can win in many ways.
But Liverpool was severely tested, and it was only after four substitutions that the game shifted decisively in favor of the Premier League side.
Inter put it under the sort of pressure it rarely faces and, at least initially, it did not respond particularly well.
Inter seemed to deflate upon that, and the second was rather scruffy, again originating from a set play.
The nature of the goal will frustrate Inter, which must feel it let a chance slip through its fingers.

     Steve Nicol and Gab Marcotti disagree on how well Inter performed in their 2-0 loss to Liverpool in Champions League.
Inter started the second half on the front foot and it looked as though Liverpool didn't have an answer for their overloads down both flanks.
Lost track of Perisic early in the second half whose cross was fired into a perilous area.
After a slow start to the second half, he was replaced by Jordan Henderson.
Replaced in the second half for Naby Keita, but wasn't at fault in a game which Inter had taken over at the start of the second half.

     Liverpool's pursuit of a seventh European Cup resumes on Wednesday on CBS and Paramount+ as Jurgen Klopp's side travel to Italy to face Serie A champions Inter Milan.
ETLocation: San Siro -- Milan, ItalyTV: CBS | Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Inter +240; Draw +250; Liverpool +110 (via Caesars Sportsbook)Liverpool storylinesLiverpool's return to the Champions League this year could hardly be more different to 12 months ago.
Whilst the Colombian winger could make his European debut for his new club, Mohamed Salah will bring up a half century of Champions League matches for the Reds if he features.
PredictionThis is unlikely to be an easy game for Liverpool but that quality off the bench could pay dividends as the Reds return home in control of the tie.
Pick: Inter 1 Liverpool 2

     Liverpool showed their ruthless edge in the Champions League once again this season as Jurgen Klopp's side secured a 2-0 last 16 first leg win at Inter Milan.
81st Min: Inter are not giving up on this game, as a sliding block from Thiago presents Perisic with a chance but his strike flies over the bar.
79th Min: Liverpool want a second goal as Keita knocks down Salah's floated pass but Skriniar gets back to tackle Diaz.
38th Min: Liverpool finally get a break inside the Inter Milan box but Mo Salah is denied by two sliding defenders.
Inter Milan find themselves in a similar situation in Serie A as they look to chase down city rivals AC Milan in their title defence.
