     Charles Barkley trolled UNC alum Kenny Smith so hard over NCAA title game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charles Barkley trolled UNC alum Kenny Smith so hard over NCAA title gameCharles Barkley didn’t have Shaq to kick around during March Madness coverage this year, but he definitely still had Kenny Smith.
During Monday’s NCAA title game between Kansas and North Carolina, Barkley lived his best life at the expense of Smith, a Tar Heels alum.
Amid a timeout after Kansas made a late basket to take a 65-61 lead, Barkley walked up to Smith and started dancing to “YMCA” by The Village People.
Barkley, though he attended Auburn for college, had predicted before the game that Kansas would win.
Take a look at the funny video where Smith wasn’t having any of it and turned his chair away from Barkley.

Barkley, in the postgame TBS show on Saturday, guaranteed a Jayhawks national title.

     Charles Barkley Mercilessly Trolls Kenny Smith As UNC Blows Biggest Lead In National Championship Game History To Kansas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charles Barkley couldn’t help but troll his broadcast buddy Kenny Smith on Monday after Smith’s North Carolina Tar Heels lost the national championship to the Kansas Jayhawks.
After Kansas’ win in the national semifinals game against Villanova on Saturday, Barkley guaranteed the Jayhawks would win the national title.
They were a fringe tournament team for most of the season, and then things changed with the final game of the ACC regular season.
The Tar Heels defeated Marquette in round one and then upset the number-one seed, the Baylor Bears, in round two, to advance to the Sweet 16.
In many respects, that was Carolina’s national title game.
