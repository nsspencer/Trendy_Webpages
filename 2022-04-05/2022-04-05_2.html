     Kristin Cavallari Made Out With Tyler Cameron From 'The Bachelorette'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kristin Cavallari and Tyler Cameron were spotted making out — but it’s not what it looks like.
For the campaign, the Very Cavallari star wore a flowy dress and cowboy boots, while Cameron kept it simple in jeans and a gray T-shirt.
Cavallari seems to be standing on her tiptoes to kiss Cameron, which tracks because he’s over six feet tall.
Cavallari, 35, filed for divorce from her estranged husband, NFL star Jay Cutler, in April 2020 after seven years of marriage.
Last July, Cameron told host Andy Cohen that he was “very in love” with Kendra.
