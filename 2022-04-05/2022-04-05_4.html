     Summary: "They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn their bodies," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
Ukrainian officials said the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv that were recaptured from Russian forces.
Zelenskyy said the civilian death toll may actually be much higher in cities that have been liberated from Russian control.
Zelenskyy said Russia is guilty of war crimes.
Western nations expelled dozens more of Moscow’s diplomats Tuesday and weighed further sanctions as they expressed their revulsion at what they say are war crimes.

     Zelenskyy calls for a Nuremberg-style tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russian war crimes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for a Nuremberg-style tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russian war crimes in a speech before the United Nations Security Council.
"The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes in Ukraine," Zelenskyy said in his nearly 20-minute speech on Tuesday.
Zelenskyy's appearance before the U.N. Security Council follows Ukrainian claims that at least 300 civilians were tortured and killed in Bucha by Russian troops.
Zelenskyy described the aftermath in Bucha, which he saw firsthand on Monday, as a "genocide" and accused Russia of war crimes.
"Based on the currently available information, the United States has assessed that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine," Thomas-Greenfield said on Tuesday.

     Summary: Zelenskyy urges U.N. Security Council to boot Russia or dissolve for the world's sakeEnlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesEditor's note: This story contains descriptions of violence that some may find disturbing.
Zelenskyy doubts the council's ability to hold Russia accountableIt's difficult for the Security Council — the U.N.'s most powerful body — to hold Russia accountable for its war in Ukraine because it is a permanent council member with veto power.
"Where is the security that the Security Council was supposed to guarantee?"
Zelenskyy also highlighted the unlikelihood of the U.N. to take action in light of Russia's permanent seat on the Security Council and its veto power.
He compared their actions to those of terrorist groups such as ISIS, with the only difference being that Russia sits on the Security Council.
