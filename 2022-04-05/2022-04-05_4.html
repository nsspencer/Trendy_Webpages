Ukrainian officials said the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv that were recaptured from Russian forces.
Zelenskyy said the civilian death toll may actually be much higher in cities that have been liberated from Russian control.
Zelenskyy said Russia is guilty of war crimes.
Western nations expelled dozens more of Moscow’s diplomats Tuesday and weighed further sanctions as they expressed their revulsion at what they say are war crimes.

     Zelenskyy calls for a Nuremberg-style tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russian war crimes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for a Nuremberg-style tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russian war crimes in a speech before the United Nations Security Council.
"The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes in Ukraine," Zelenskyy said in his nearly 20-minute speech on Tuesday.
Zelenskyy's appearance before the U.N. Security Council follows Ukrainian claims that at least 300 civilians were tortured and killed in Bucha by Russian troops.
Zelenskyy described the aftermath in Bucha, which he saw firsthand on Monday, as a "genocide" and accused Russia of war crimes.
"Based on the currently available information, the United States has assessed that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine," Thomas-Greenfield said on Tuesday.
