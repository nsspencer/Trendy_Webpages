     Deandre Ayton's Status For Suns Game On Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns are hosting the Los Angeles Lakers in Arizona on Tuesday evening, and for the game they will have their starting center Deandre Ayton back in the lineup.
The 2018 first overall pick had gotten the day off in their last game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, but on Tuesday he is not on the injury report.
The Suns enter the contest having already clinched the top seed in the Western Conference with a very impressive 62-16 record in the 78 games that they have played in so far this season.

     Lakers player grades: L.A. gets burned by Phoenix Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the first half of Tuesday’s game against the Phoenix Suns, the Los Angeles Lakers were very competitive and even maintained a lead, and it looked like perhaps they had at least an outside chance of beating the team with the NBA’s best record.
But L.A. was on the wrong side of a third-quarter onslaught, as it has been so many times this season.
The Lakers ended up falling, 121-110, and now it’s official – they are out of contention for a spot in the play-in tournament.
LeBron James sat out his fourth game in the last five due to a sprained ankle, and without him, L.A. had two chances of winning and salvaging its season – slim and none.
It was a sad, meek and dispirited ending to one of the most disappointing seasons in the history of any major team sport.

     Summary: The One Thing the Phoenix Suns Need to Get Right Before PlayoffsThe One Thing the Phoenix Suns Need to Get Right Before Playoffs by Collin HelwigThe Phoenix Suns have been a staple of excellence all season long.
They’ve been the most consistent team, winning even with their stars sometimes injured or ill.
Phoenix Suns Defeat the Los Angeles Lakers, Breaking their Season Win RecordThe Suns entered tonight’s bout naturally looking a bit dysfunctional following their two straight losses.
Needing to win only one more game to break their franchise’s win record, Phoenix fans, and likely the players, both grew hungrier for that coveted dub as the days passed.
The Suns officially wrapped up that 63rd victory, eclipsing the team’s previous record of 62 wins held by the 1992-93 Suns and the 2004-05 Suns.
