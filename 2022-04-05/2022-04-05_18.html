     Summary: Hawk just recently broke his femur while on his board, although it did not prevent him from attending the March 12th South by Southwest premiere of the documentary film about his life and legendary career, Tony Hawk: Until the Wheels Fall Off.
They don't think it's impossible, and they don't think I'll be at a hundred percent, but that's my goal right now," he says.
Hawk is driven and clearly doesn't let things like injuries, or age, get in the way of his skating goals.
"I was around the entire time, and I used to see Tony skate in 1983 at Del Mar," Jones says.

And you’re dropping into these pools and the crowd is just all around, two feet away as you’re doing this.
I guess I flew too close to the sun, because here I am, broken leg.
I know I'm old, but if I can still do this, why would I not do this?
And the idea that people think I'm still relevant or worth paying attention to, I'm just thankful for it.
