     Bobby Rydell, Teenage Idol With Enduring Appeal, Dies at 79
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bobby Rydell, a Philadelphia-born singer who became a teenage idol in the late 1950s and, with his pleasant voice, stage presence and nice-guy demeanor, maintained a loyal following on tours even after both he and his original fans were well past retirement age, died on Tuesday in Abington, Pa.
Mr. Rydell and two other affable performers who became stars in those years, Frankie Avalon and Fabian, grew up within about two blocks of one another in South Philadelphia.
Long after their days on the pop chart were past them, they enjoyed great success on the oldies circuit.
Mr. Rydell did not just have staying power; he also made a comeback after years of alcohol abuse, which he chronicled in his autobiography, “Bobby Rydell: Teen Idol on the Rocks” (2016), written with the guitarist and producer Allan Slutsky.
But five months later, he underwent cardiac bypass surgery.

     Bobby Rydell, 'Wild One' singer, dead at 79
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Bobby Rydell, a teen idol from the '60s known for songs like "Wild One" and his role as Hugo Peabody in the 1963 film "Bye Bye Birdie," has died, according to a statement released by his representatives.
Rydell died on April 5 in Abington, Pennsylvania, from pneumonia complications, which were unrelated to Covid-19, the statement said.
Born Robert Ridarelli, Rydell got his first song on the Billboard 100 in 1959 and went on to have a career that included 34 top 100 hits and more than 25 million album sales, according to the statement.
Rydell, who opened up about receiving a double organ transplant in 2012 in his 2016 biography "Teen Idol on the Rocks: A Tale of Second Chances," was an advocate for organ donation and supporter of The Gift of Life, a nonprofit that helps families impacted by organ transplants.
Rydell is survived by his wife, Linda J. Hoffman, son Robert Ridarelli, daughter Jennifer Dulin, and his five grandchildren, according to the statement.

I wasn’t a soft shoe type of guy, but I was always a fairly good mover, and everything in Bye Bye Birdie is all moves.
