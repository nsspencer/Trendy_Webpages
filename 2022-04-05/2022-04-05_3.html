     Student Loans Are Set to Be Paused Again, Pushing Payments to September
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Biden will allow millions of federal student loan borrowers to freeze their payments until Aug. 31, according to an administration official briefed on the matter, the latest extension of a pandemic relief measure that began more than two years ago.
Those debts have not been accruing interest, and seven million borrowers in default have received a break from paycheck garnishments and other collection efforts.
The extension is expected to be announced this week, according to the administration official, who was not authorized to speak about the plans before the announcement.
The four-month delay means the pause will become an issue again before the midterm elections and remain a rallying cry for student debt activists who have called for Mr. Biden to cancel at least some debt outright.
Americans owe $1.6 trillion on federal student loans — more than they owe on car loans, credit cards or any consumer debt other than mortgages.

     Summary: Student Loans: Can Your Credit Recover From Late Payments?
michaeljung / Getty Images/iStockphotoThe federally mandated forbearance on student loans will expire on May 1, 2022, meaning millions of borrowers will soon be required to resume monthly payments.
Because student loans are a form of debt, your student loan amount and payment history will go on your credit report.
A series of late payments on your student loan can cause your credit score to drop significantly.
“Defaulting on your student loans, which occurs after a 120-day delinquency on private student loans and 270 to 360 days for federal student loans, can have a bigger impact on your credit score.”However, Kasasa noted that even if a delinquency is added to your credit report, you can make a case to have it removed.

     Biden administration expected to extend payment pause for student loan borrowers through August
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty ImagesThe Biden administration plans to announce another extension to the payment pause for federal student loan borrowers, sources tell CNBC.
Currently, the pandemic-era relief policy suspending student loan bills is scheduled to lapse in May.
Yet the Biden administration has expressed reluctance to resume the payments before it makes its decision on student loan forgiveness.
"The president is going to look at what we should do on student debt before the pause expires, or he'll extend the pause," White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said last month on the podcast "Pod Save America."
"Joe Biden right now is the only president in history where no one's paid on their student loans for the entirety of his presidency," Klain said.

Join us for a live conversation on student loan paymentsWhat are the pros and cons of these repeated extensions?
Democrats and advocates for student loan borrowers have said that more relief is needed as Americans face higher costs as a result of rising inflation gripping the economy.

Some private student lenders whose business has been harmed by the pandemic relief have been lobbying the Biden administration to end the program and restart federal student loan payments for many borrowers.

     Summary: WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden plans to extend the moratorium on federal student loan payments through Aug. 31, the Associated Press reported, citing a federal official.
All the while, the nation’s $1.7 trillion student loan debt portfolio continues to grow, with no firm direction for the indebted.
Want student loan forgiveness?
That’s likely an uphill battle with an evenly split Senate and Republicans broadly opposed to debt forgiveness.

     Biden Likely To Extend The Student Loan Payment Pause — Here’s Why
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are increasing signs that Biden is likely to extend the student loan payment pause again, although so far, there is nothing official.
Student Loan Payment Pause Expires in 26 daysThe CARES Act, which Congress enacted in March 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, is responsible for the long-running pause on most student loan payments (specifically for government-held federal student loans).
This week, hundreds of student loan borrower activists descended on Washington, D.C. and held a protest and march, urging Biden to extend the payment pause and cancel student loan debt through executive action.
And another poll released last week showed wide support for across-the-board student loan forgiveness, and suggested that likely voters may be motivated to vote by actions to provide student loan relief.
