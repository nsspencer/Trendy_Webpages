     Tory Lanez violated restraining orders for Megan Thee Stallion, prosecutors say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A judge ordered that rapper Tory Lanez be remanded into custody Tuesday after prosecutors said he violated a restraining order obtained by his former girlfriend Megan Thee Stallion.
Lanez violated the orders by addressing his ex-girlfriend directly on social media and by discussing DNA evidence, prosecutors told the judge.
He is accused of shooting Megan Thee Stallion, whose real name is Megan Pete, during a 2020 dispute.
Alex Spiro, the attorney for Megan Thee Stallion, emphasized in a statement Tuesday that a judge had found sufficient evidence to order Lanez to stand trial.
Megan Thee Stallion said in July 2020 that she had been shot in the foot and required surgery to remove the bullet.

     Rapper Tory Lanez arrested for social media posts directed at Megan Thee Stallion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rapper Tory Lanez, who is charged with shooting Megan Thee Stallion in the Hollywood Hills in the summer of 2020, was taken into custody in a Downtown Los Angeles courtroom Tuesday for allegedly violating the terms of a pre-trial protective order.
L.A. County Superior Court Judge David Herriford agreed with prosecutors that some of Lanez's recent social media posts appeared to be messages directed at Megan Thee Stallion.
The detective said Megan Thee Stallion told police that Lanez "offered her money" and begged her not to say anything, telling her that he was on probation -- something Stogner said he could never substantiate.
Megan Thee Stallion, who was bleeding, and Lanez were among four people in the SUV that was stopped about a mile from the scene of where shots were reported, according to LAPD Officer Sandra Cabral.
In a video posted on Instagram Live following the shooting, Megan Thee Stallion said, "Tory shot me.
