     Champions League: I always overthink in UCL, says Pep Guardiola ahead of Atletico quarter-final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Premier League defending champions Manchester City will face La Liga defending Champions Atletico de Madrid in the quarter-final of the UEFA Champions League at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday.
Manchester City finished runners-up in the UEFA Champions League last season, losing to Chelsea in the final.
Man City manager Pep Guardiola said in his press conference ahead of the game that he tends to “overthink” in the Champions League.
"In the Champions League I always overthink -- new tactics, tomorrow you will see a new one.
I overthink a lot, that's why I have very good results in the Champions League," Guardiola told reporters on Monday.

     Man City vs. Atletico Madrid best bets, odds, lines, picks, and expert predictions for Champions League quarterfinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pep Guardiola says he will be ready with "stupid tactics" as Man City gets set to face Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal matchup.
While City's seven-match stretch has seen 15 goals scored on an expected goals (xG) number of 17.08, suggesting the team could even be doing slightly better, Atleti's winning streak saw 15 goals scored on 9.08 xG.
Atletico Madrid playmaker Angel Correa's whopping xG differential of +4.51 is third in La Liga behind only Juanmi of Real Betis (+7.22!)
With chance creator Carracso sidelined, Man City can focus on locking down Correa, and thus locking down much of Atleti's attack.
While Man City averages 7 corners a game this season across all competitions, the Champions League is a different story.
