     Matt Gaetz and defense secretary argue over US military capability and 'wokeism'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Rep. Matt Gaetz got into a heated argument during Tuesday's House Armed Services hearing after the Florida Republican accused the Pentagon of being too focused on "wokeism" and not defense.
Austin charged that Gaetz appeared to be "embarrassed for his country" by questioning the US military's capability, and the two men shouted over one another at several points.
Not if we continue to embrace socialism," Gaetz charged.
"The fact that you're embarrassed by your country, by your military.
I'm sorry for that," Austin shot back.

     Matt Gaetz Narrowly Avoids Being Called a “Smug Little Shit” in Official Congressional Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last June, Florida representative Matt Gaetz used his allotted time during a congressional hearing to attack military leadership over the Republican–manufactured claim that the U.S military has become a bastion of wokeism by teaching critical race theory.
Unfortunately for Gaetz, the stunt clearly didn’t pan out as he’d hoped, and he essentially had his ass handed to him on live TV.
Sounding like a bratty teen yelling at his parents, the lawmaker lectured Austin: “You guys said that Russia would overrun Ukraine in 36 days.
And maybe we would be better at them if the National Defense University worked a little more on strategy and a little less on wokeism.”Twitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.
To this Austin asked him, “Has it occurred to you has Russia has not overrun Ukraine because of what we’ve done?

     Summary: Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin skirmished with Florida GOP Rep.

     Summary: Republican Florida Representative Matt Gaetz is facing backlash after tangling with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin over alleged "wokeism" in the military.
Matt Gaetz giving military advice is like Mr. Magoo working in an ER.

     Lloyd Austin hits back at Matt Gaetz: ‘I’m sorry you are embarrassed by your country’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin appeared so incensed by outlandish lines of questioning from Republican congressman Matt Gaetz that he ended up in a shouting match with the Florida representative by the end of Mr Gaetz’s five minute round.
Specifically, Mr Gaetz enquired about a lecture delivered at the US National Defence University by French economist and author Thomas Picketty entitled “Responding to China: The Case For Global Justice and Democratic Socialism”.
“Why should American taxpayers fund lectures at the National Defense University that promote socialism as a strategy to combat China?” he asked.
Mr Austin said he would let the budget request speak for itself, but Mr Gaetz did not stop badgering him about the US being “behind in hypersonics” and having “failed to deter Russia”.
“I’m sorry you are embarrassed by your country,” the retired general said.
