     Melissa Lucio news latest: Kim Kardashian appeals to Texas governor as bipartisan group of lawmakers and trial juror say death sentence wrong
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lucio’s execution by lethal injection is set to take place on 27 April following the 2007 death of her daughter Mariah.
Her lawyers say that her daughter died from falling down a steep staircase outside their apartment in Harlingen, South Texas.
Her lawyers say she was worn down by her grief and being abused throughout her life and finally admitted to a crime she didn’t commit.
On 18 October, the US Supreme Court denied a petition to hear Lucio’s case, paving the way for the state of Texas to set the date for her execution.
In a letter last month to the Board of Pardons and Paroles and to Governor Abbott, 83 Texas House members said executing Lucio would be “a miscarriage of justice”.
