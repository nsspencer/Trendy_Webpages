     Summary: The Phoenix Suns are hosting the Los Angeles Lakers in Arizona on Tuesday evening, and for the game they will have their starting center Deandre Ayton back in the lineup.
The 2018 first overall pick had gotten the day off in their last game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, but on Tuesday he is not on the injury report.
The Suns enter the contest having already clinched the top seed in the Western Conference with a very impressive 62-16 record in the 78 games that they have played in so far this season.

     Lakers out of NBA postseason contention after Suns rout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over and out: Anthony Davis heads to the bench as the Los Angeles Lakers are officially eliminated from postseason contentionLos Angeles (AFP) – The Los Angeles Lakers were officially eliminated from postseason contention on Tuesday as the Phoenix Suns sent the crisis-stricken NBA giants spinning to a seventh straight defeat.
The Los Angeles defeat -– and San Antonio's 116-97 win over the Denver Nuggets earlier Tuesday -– mean the Lakers will not be in the postseason for the first time since 2019.
It is only the fourth time since James entered the league in 2003 that the NBA superstar has failed to reach the postseason.
Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers and Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder have both been linked to the Lakers hotseat.
With San Antonio clinching victory over Denver well before the Lakers-Suns game had finished, Los Angeles knew that only a win would do in Phoenix.

They’ve been the most consistent team, winning even with their stars sometimes injured or ill.
Phoenix Suns Defeat the Los Angeles Lakers, Breaking their Season Win RecordThe Suns entered tonight’s bout naturally looking a bit dysfunctional following their two straight losses.
Needing to win only one more game to break their franchise’s win record, Phoenix fans, and likely the players, both grew hungrier for that coveted dub as the days passed.
The Suns officially wrapped up that 63rd victory, eclipsing the team’s previous record of 62 wins held by the 1992-93 Suns and the 2004-05 Suns.

     Suns set franchise record with win No. 63, eliminate Lakers from playoffs

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns won their 63rd game of the season on Tuesday, a 121-110 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers to set a new franchise record.
The win also eliminates the Lakers from playoff contention after the San Antonio Spurs beat the Denver Nuggets earlier on Tuesday.
The Spurs now have a three-game lead and own the tiebreaker over the Lakers with three games remaining.

The Suns said before the game the Lakers’ fate didn’t matter to them but their swagger on the court indicated otherwise.

Anthony Johnson was part of three different NBA teams to establish franchise record for wins.
Gilgeous-Alexander went from averaging 10.8 points as a rookie with the Los Angeles Clippers to 19.0 his second NBA season playing alongside Paul in OKC.
The third time was in the 2009-10 season in New Orleans when Paul only played 45 games.
That’s the lowest number of games he’s played in a single season in his NBA career.
