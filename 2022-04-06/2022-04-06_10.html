     Bills extend Stefon Diggs‚Äô contract
    </h2>

     Summary: Getty ImagesBills wide receiver Stefon Diggs had two years remaining on the five-year, $72 million contract.
But when the wide receiver market exploded this offseason, it became clear that Diggs was going to want a raise sooner rather than later.

Diggs was traded from the Vikings to the Bills in 2020 and has made the Pro Bowl in both of his seasons in Buffalo.
The Bills think Diggs and Josh Allen are going to be a winning combination for years to come.

     Summary: Another wide receiver got P-A-I-D.
The Buffalo Bills agreed to terms with wideout Stefon Diggs on a four-year, $96 million contract extension that can be worth more in incentives, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday morning.
Diggs will receive a $21.5 million signing bonus and $70 million in total guarantees as part of his new deal, Rapoport added.
Diggs' deal comes on the heels of Davante Adams and Tyreek Hill inking massive contracts with the Las Vegas Raiders and Miami Dolphins, respectively.
