     Cavaliers May Keep Falling After Latest Defeat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cleveland Cavaliers are still set to make the postseason but it looks like they’ll be limping into it.
The Cavaliers needed two wins in their last three games to guarantee avoiding dropping below eighth.
— Tim Bontemps (@TimBontemps) April 6, 2022The Cavaliers fell to the 15th-seed Orlando Magic, 120-115.
After the loss on Tuesday, they will have to defeat Brooklyn on Friday to stay in their current spot.
Those two parts of the team were vital earlier in the season and they are desperately missed now.

     Summary: Apr 5, 2022; Orlando, Florida, USA; Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love (0) looks to pass the ball guarded by Orlando Magic center Moritz Wagner (21) in the first half at Amway Center.
Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-USA TODAY SportsCleveland Cavaliers shoot themselves in the foot with crucial lossThe Cleveland Cavaliers fell for the fourth time in five games after surrendering a 120-115 loss to the Orlando Magic.
The Cavs simply blew it against the worst-ranked team in the Eastern Conference, giving up their final chance to compete for a guaranteed spot in the playoffs.
The Magic even erected a 10-point lead of their own, before the Cavs made a last-ditch effort for a failed comeback in the final minutes.
Welcoming back either or both Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen will certainly give the Cleveland Cavaliers a much-needed boost, especially on the defensive end of the floor as the team looks to arrest this regression.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dick ScanlonThe Associated PressORLANDO, Fla. — The Cavaliers gave up 120 points to one of the NBA's most offensively challenged teams Tuesday night and took a loss that locked them into the Eastern Conference play-in tournament.
Mo Bamba had 20 points and 12 rebounds, Ignas Brazdeikis scored 20 off the bench and the Orlando Magic beat the Cavaliers 120-115 to stop a six-game losing streak.
Markelle Fultz, who finished with 16 points and six assists in his first start of the season, rallied the Magic in the third quarter.
Bamba hit all five of his 3-point shots in the first 10 minutes to help the Magic quickly erase the Cavs' 14-3 game-opening burst.
Forward Wendell Carter Jr. (sprained left wrist) missed a fourth consecutive game.

     Magic: Jalen Suggs reacts to starting next to Markelle Fultz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jalen Suggs on Tuesday returned from a 10-game absence and helped the Orlando Magic defeat the struggling Cleveland Cavaliers to snap a six-game losing streak.
Suggs recorded four points, two assists, one rebound, one steal and one blocked shot in 18 minutes during the 120-115 victory.
The injury came as Suggs battled through a sprain on the same ankle during the early part of the month.
Magic head coach Jamahl Mosley opted to insert Suggs back into the starting lineup versus the Cavaliers.
Of course, the starting lineup next season is far from decided but Fultz sees what Suggs brings to the court on a nightly basis for the Magic.

     Cavs endure worst loss of season, with defensive effort coming up short against Magic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. — The Cleveland Cavaliers suffered their worst loss of the season at an inopportune time.The Cavs’ 120-115 loss to the Orlando Magic on Tuesday was their worst not because of the margin, but because of the lack of defensive effort and the possible fallout.
In coach J.B. Bickerstaff’s assessment, there was no focus.“Plain and simple, they outcompeted us,” he said.
And we didn’t take the challenge to keep guys in front of us, keep them out of the paint.
Something we’ve got to figure out, we’ve got to find a way to remedy it.
Heading into the game, the Cavs knew the importance of the matchup against the Magic, one of the league’s worst teams, and the need to win as the regular season winds down.
