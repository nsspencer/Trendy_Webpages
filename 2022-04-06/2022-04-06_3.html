     Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness’ latest trailer is the stuff of nightmares
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Multiverse of Madness’ newest ad spot doesn’t explicitly spell out how reality comes undone around Earth’s magical heroes, it may explain why by confirming the return of two interesting characters.
Despite Wanda and Strange not having spent the most time on screen together up until this point, the new trailer establishes that the pair have quite a bit in common.
For example, they both have recurring dreams of (what appear to be) other universes only to wake up in their home realities, which feel like nightmares.
The MCU’s rules about whether people are meant to be mucking around in other realities haven’t exactly been set in stone yet.
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness hits theaters on May 6.

     Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness Has The 'Flavor Of Horror,' Sam Raimi Teases
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" is bound to be a film that is wide in scope, given it will deal with the direct repercussions of the events that took place at the end of "Spider-Man: No Way Home."
But even after Scott left the picture due to creative differences, that was still the mandate — to make the first Marvel film that had an element of horror.
Plus, Doctor Strange in the comics has always dealt in universes and dimensions that were quite spooky, so we tried to bring some of that into this film."
That sounds intriguing, to say the least, and as Raimi himself has commented about titillating audience fears, "Multiverse of Madness" might just be able to achieve that to good end.
"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" hits theaters on May 6, 2022.
