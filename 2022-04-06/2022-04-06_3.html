     Eric Boehlert, Media Critic and Writer, Dies at 57
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eric Boehlert, a veteran journalist who was a fierce critic of right-wing misinformation and hypocrisy in the news media, died on Monday in New Jersey.
Mr. Boehlert was struck by a New Jersey Transit train while riding his bicycle near the Watchung Avenue station in Montclair.
His death was confirmed by his wife, Tracy Breslin.
A frequent commentator on television and radio, as well as a prolific writer, Mr. Boehlert never shied away from searing critiques of what he saw as bias in the mainstream press and the circular impact of media on politics.
After more than a decade as a senior fellow at Media Matters for America, a left-leaning media monitoring group, Mr. Boehlert had in recent years started his own newsletter, Press Run, as a vehicle for his commentary.

     Eric Boehlert, Former Billboard Editor-Turned-Media Critic, Dies at 57
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eric Boehlert — who evolved from fire-breathing music-business investigative reporter and editor at Billboard and Rolling Stone to a media critic and pundit whose social-media accounts and 2-year-old Press Run newsletter were progressive must-reads — died Monday at 57.
His friend, journalist Soledad O’Brien, reported the news and called him a “fierce and fearless defender of the truth.” Boehlert was bicycling in his hometown, Montclair, New Jersey, when a train struck him at a railroad crossing.
“What a loss.”In his three-times-a-week commentaries, Boehlert argued that mainstream-media reporters, particularly in The New York Times, unfairly slammed Democrats while kowtowing to Republicans.
“Eric was super-smart, highly creative, a diligent reporter and crazy about music,” recalls Ken Schlager, Billboard‘s former executive editor.
“The story he filed afterwards was packed with Eric’s trademark wit.”At Billboard, he investigated corporate injustice in the music business.
