     Par-3 Contest Sees a Jason Kokrak Ace, Plenty of Kids and a Weather Suspension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first Masters Par-3 Contest in three years wasn't finished, but Canadians Mike Weir and Mackenzie Hughes had the low scores.
Kids are a highlight of the Masters Par-3 Contest, and Russell Henley's son Robert got into the action on Wednesday.
But the Par-3 Contest at the Masters on Wednesday brings out legends and stars alike as a warmup to the tournament proper on Thursday.
It was the first time the Par-3 Contest has been held since 2019 due to the COVID pandemic.
Jason Kokrak made the only hole-in-one of the day, making a 1 on the 4th hole, where an ace hadn’t been recorded since 2016.

     2022 Masters Par 3 Contest coverage: Jason Kokrak ace, Fred Couples besting Tiger Woods among day's highlights
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 event ends with a three-way tie, meaning Mike Weir, Mackenzie Hughes and Kevin Na will all share the victory.
The Par 3 Contest had not been played since 2019 after being postponed two years amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Kokrak's hole-in-one was the 91st since the Par 3 contest began in 1960.
Standing alongside Justin Thomas and Fred Couples, the three simultaneously tried skipping the water onto the green, as is tradition.
However, only Couples was successful as Woods and Thomas' balls found the drink.

     Summary: And as it turns out, even Augusta National isn’t immune from an increasingly common issue these days.
The Georgia Peach Ice Cream Sandwich — possibly one of the finest $2 desserts in the free world — hasn’t been available at Augusta National this week.
“We have had some modest price increases,” Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley said.
The par-4 11th at Augusta National is now longer than the par-5 13th.
“We are going to go forward on our own timetable and make changes we think to,” Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley said.

     Par 3 Contest cut short by weather, brings back iconic Masters Week moments

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A shortened Par 3 Contest was sandwiched between two weather systems, but what onlookers did get to see brought back images of past Masters Tournaments.
“Still really fun.
Mackenzie Hughes and 2003 Masters champion Mike Weir ended in a tie for the lead at 4-under par and were declared co-champs.
A good number of the field had never experienced the Par 3 Contest before this year, so their first one being cut short wasn’t ideal.
