     Par-3 Contest Sees a Jason Kokrak Ace, Plenty of Kids and a Weather Suspension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first Masters Par-3 Contest in three years wasn't finished, but Canadians Mike Weir and Mackenzie Hughes had the low scores.
Kids are a highlight of the Masters Par-3 Contest, and Russell Henley's son Robert got into the action on Wednesday.
But the Par-3 Contest at the Masters on Wednesday brings out legends and stars alike as a warmup to the tournament proper on Thursday.
It was the first time the Par-3 Contest has been held since 2019 due to the COVID pandemic.
Jason Kokrak made the only hole-in-one of the day, making a 1 on the 4th hole, where an ace hadn’t been recorded since 2016.

     Par 3 Contest cut short by weather, brings back iconic Masters Week moments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A shortened Par 3 Contest was sandwiched between two weather systems, but what onlookers did get to see brought back images of past Masters Tournaments.
“Still really fun.
Mackenzie Hughes and 2003 Masters champion Mike Weir ended in a tie for the lead at 4-under par and were declared co-champs.
A good number of the field had never experienced the Par 3 Contest before this year, so their first one being cut short wasn’t ideal.
“This is my third Masters and my first Par 3 Contest.

     Summary: Masters Par-3 Contest: Everything you need to know for Wednesday’s eventShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailJustin Thomas, Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler — with their significant others caddying — played the Masters Par-3 Contest together in 2019.
Getty ImagesIt’s been a few years since we had the Masters Par-3 Contest grace our TV screens.
And the other main takeaway: No winner of the Par-3 Contest has ever gone on to win the same edition of the Masters.
How it startedThe idea for the Par-3 Contest is attributed to Augusta National Chairman and co-founder Clifford Roberts, though not everyone at the club was onboard from the start.
The formatCurrent and past Masters champions are invited to play a relaxing round on the 9-hole par-3 course the Wednesday before the first round of the Masters.

     2022 Masters Par 3 Contest coverage: Jason Kokrak ace, Fred Couples besting Tiger Woods among day's highlights
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 event ends with a three-way tie, meaning Mike Weir, Mackenzie Hughes and Kevin Na will all share the victory.
The Par 3 Contest had not been played since 2019 after being postponed two years amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Kokrak's hole-in-one was the 91st since the Par 3 contest began in 1960.
Standing alongside Justin Thomas and Fred Couples, the three simultaneously tried skipping the water onto the green, as is tradition.
However, only Couples was successful as Woods and Thomas' balls found the drink.
