     The Spurs will face the Pelicans in the 9-10 match-up of the Play-in Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Spurs never had expectations coming into the season, and the Pelicans were quickly written off after a 3-16 start and former no.
The Spurs won the season series 3-1, so they own the tie breaker over the Pelicans.
The Spurs remaining schedule is tough, with road games at Minnesota and Dallas, plus a home game against the Warriors sandwiched in between.
The Pelicans have a slightly easier remaining schedule, against Portland and Golden State at home and the Grizzlies on the road.
As a reminder, the winner of the 9-10 matchup will advance to face the loser of 7-8 matchup to compete for the 8th seed, while the loser is eliminated.

     Surging Spurs bid to take down Timberwolves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Antonio Spurs are looking to keep their momentum headed in the right direction Thursday when they play the host Minnesota Timberwolves at Minneapolis.
Minnesota (45-35) is guaranteed no worse than seventh place in the Western Conference -- and a home game in the play-in tournament.
The Timberwolves, however, could earn the sixth seed and avoid the play-in tournament if they win their final two games and Denver drops its final two.
The Spurs (34-45) can finish ninth in the West -- and secure a home game in the play-in tournament -- if they end up tied with New Orleans.
"I'm proud of that achievement," Poeltl said of the team making the play-in tournament.

     Summary: That was the Spurs’ let’s-not-get-too-high mantra after all but clinching a play-in berth with Tuesday’s impressive 116-97 win over Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets.
"We are just playing every game,” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.
