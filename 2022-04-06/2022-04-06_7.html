     What Putin Has Said About Daughters Katerina Tikhonova, Maria Vorontsova
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over the course of his presidency, Russia's Vladimir Putin has rarely spoken about his two daughters, Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova.
Bloomberg also reported that the European Union was planning to sanction Putin's daughters, citing unnamed sources.
In 2015, Putin held a press conference where he was asked by reporters about his daughters.
"They have their own family life," Putin says in one portion of the interviews.
"We hardly see each other, each of us has our own life," Putin said in 2013, according to the BBC.

     Why US, EU targeted Putin's daughters Mariya, Katerina in new sanctions?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amid mounting global accusations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine, the United States on Wednesday announced a new set of sanctions targeting President Vladimir Putin’s two adult daughters Mariya Putina (Vorontsova) and Katerina Tikhonova, and said it was toughening penalties against Russian banks.
The penalties cut off all of Putin’s close family members from the US financial system and freeze any assets they hold in the United States.
Who are Mariya Putina and Katerina Tikhonova?
Mariya Vorontsova and Katerina (or Ekaterina) Tikhonova are in their mid-30s.
She was thus deemed to benefit from the Russian government and was involved in a sector providing its revenue.

     Why the U.S. is targeting Putin's daughters Katerina and Maria
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/Evgenia NovozheninaWASHINGTON, April 6 (Reuters) - The United States' latest round of sanctions on Russia includes two new targets: Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters, Katerina and Maria, who U.S. officials believe are hiding Putin's wealth.
Putin's daughter Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova is a tech executive whose work supports the Russian government and its defense industry, according to details in the U.S. sanctions package announced on Wednesday.
"We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden with family members, and that's why we're targeting them," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The extent of Putin's wealth is a sensitive subject in Russia.
Putin's elder daughter Maria studied biology at St. Petersburg University and medicine at Moscow State University, according to the Reuters investigation.

     Who are Vladimir Putin’s daughters? Why Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova face sanctions for Ukraine war
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US has sanctioned Vladimir Putin’s two daughters in response to atrocities committed during the invasion of Ukraine.
President Putin has two adult daughters; Maria Vorontsova, 36, and, Katerina Tikhonova, 35.
Their mother is President Putin’s former wife, Lyudmila Putina, who he married in 1983 and divorced in 2014.
In 2013, Ms Tikhonova married Kirill Shamalov, the son of Nikolay Shamalov, a co-owner of Rossiya Bank.
She said sanctions had frozen more than $350bn (about £266bn) of “Putin’s war chest”, rendering unavailable about 60 per cent of the regime’s $604bn (£459bn) of foreign currency reserves.
