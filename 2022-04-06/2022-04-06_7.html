     Chicago Fire Producer Andrea Newman Reveals The Actor Who's The 'Big Brother' On Set
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In addition to Andrea Newman, "Chicago Fire" co-creator Derek Haas and stars Eamonn Walker ("Chief Boden") and Hanako Greensmith ("Violet Mikami") were on hand for the roundtable.
"We've had so many good people come through — some stay a long time, some stay a little bit," says Walker.
While he may have been playing coy, Newman thinks something larger is going on with his avoidance of the question.
"Not only is he a fantastic performer, but he's kind of ... the big brother of everyone on set.
He's amazing that way.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Chicago Fire‘s newest couple, paramedic Violet Mikami and her boss Paramedic Field Chief Evan Hawkins have certainly made an impression in their short time together.
At the same time that Violet is fretting over the fallout of her and Hawkins’ ill-timed smooch, she also gets a new paramedic partner while Brett is on leave.
Making her debut this week, Emma (played by The Fosters‘ Caitlin Carver) is “someone that I think will surprise quite a few people and will definitely surprise Violet as well,” Greensmith previewed.
She’s not a character that I think our show often has to toy with or has to battle.
So it’s going to be really interesting seeing how she weaves within the firehouse,” Greensmith teased.

     Why Chicago Fire Changed Its Plans For Violet And Hawkins, Plus Brett's Surprising Replacement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, Fire co-showrunner Andrea Newman and Greensmith opened up about what changed and what’s ahead.
The Chicago Fire showrunners and Hanako Greensmith spoke with CinemaBlend and other outlets in honor of the 2022 One Chicago Day, and I took the opportunity to ask about the relationship between Violet Mikami and Evan Hawkins, a.k.a.
The original plan wasn’t for Violet and Hawkins to turn romantic the way that they did, but Hanako Greensmith and Jimmy Nicholas were so good together and generated such chemistry that Chicago Fire changed plans.
Hanako Greensmith previewed what to expect from Brett’s replacement, and fans are in for some surprises:Oooh, it's gonna be juicy!
See what happens next for Violet and Hawkins – as well as how Violet meshes with her new paramedic partner – with new episodes of Chicago Fire on NBC on Wednesdays at 9 p.m.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chicago Fire midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri is “day-to-day” with a calf injury ahead of this weekend’s matchup with Orlando City at Exploria Stadium.
Shaqiri came out of last weekend’s match against FC Dallas in the 19th minute after feeling tightness in his calf.
We’re monitoring that, and he’s day-to-day right now.”Anything involving Shaqiri is concerning for the Fire, but this doesn’t appear to be a serious injury.
The Fire’s social media team highlighted his visit to the Chicago Bulls game Tuesday night, meaning he is indeed up and walking.
In other injury news, team captain Rafael Czichos is still out, undergoing MLS’s health and safety protocols related to COVID, Hendrickson said.
