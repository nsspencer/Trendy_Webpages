     NBA playoffs: A look at the Celtics' wild playoff scenarios
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Eastern Conference standings — which were already a knotted shoelace — tightened even more on Tuesday.
Entering Tuesday’s action, the Celtics, who enjoyed a second off-night in a row, sat in second place and held a half-game lead over both the Bucks and the 76ers.
But the Bucks beat the Bulls comfortably, and the 76ers fended off a late rally by the Pacers, which evened all three teams up at 49-30 with three games remaining.
In the event of a three-team tie in the standings, an incredibly complicated list of tiebreakers begins to unfold.
Here’s our best attempt to explain the landscape and what Celtics fans can expect.

     LA Lakers fall out of NBA playoff contention after seventh consecutive defeat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Los Angeles Lakers missed out on a place in the NBA playoffs this year after suffering a seventh consecutive defeat on Tuesday.
Once again missing star LeBron James through injury, the Lakers fell to a 121-110 loss to the Phoenix Suns.
It's just the fourth time in James' 19-season career that he's failed to appear in the postseason.
The 37-year-old was missing his second consecutive game after struggling with an ankle injury.
Lakers coach Frank Vogel told reporters after the game that he was "extremely disappointed" after dropping out of playoff contention.

     Summary: Asked whether he would like to return next season in the hopes of getting more time on the court with James and Davis, the 33-year-old said he would.

     Summary: When LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers were bounced in the first round of last year’s NBA playoffs, they made huge changes to their roster and vowed this year would be different.
Both teams came into this season with stacked rosters, full of current and former All-Stars, loaded with championship aspirations.
The Brooklyn Nets and Kevin Durant are also in danger of missing the playoffs.
In the 393 minutes James, Davis and Westbrook shared the floor, the Lakers were outscored.
