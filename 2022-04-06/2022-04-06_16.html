     Block says a former employee downloaded data on millions of Cash App Investing customers.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sensitive information for more than eight million users of Cash App Investing — a stock trading app run by Block, the owner of the Square payments system — was exposed when a former employee downloaded corporate reports after leaving the company.
Block revealed the data exposure in a regulatory filing on Monday, and said it was contacting the affected customers.
“Upon discovery, we took steps to remediate this issue and launched an investigation with the help of a leading forensics firm,” Fiona Lee, a Block spokeswoman, said.
“We know how these reports were accessed, and we have notified law enforcement.”The exposed data involved only users of Cash App’s investing product, not the person-to-person payment service with roughly 44 million users, the company said.

     Cash App Suffered a Data Breach, Here’s What You Need to Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Block, the parent company of the popular mobile payment service Cash App, recently confirmed Cash App suffered a data breach by a former employee.
The data breach took place back in December of 2021, and it looks like the breach included a host of personal information, but specific credentials were unaffected.
Block said the person responsible for the Cash App data breach had access to this information for their job responsibility.
The data breach only affects those in the United States.
Either way, we suggest that all Cash App users take precautions, and just to be safe, update their passwords as soon as possible.

     Over 8 million Cash App users possibly affected by data breach from a former employee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over 8 million users of the mobile payment app Cash App could be affected by a data breach after a former employee of the company downloaded reports containing the personal information of U.S. users.
Although the ex-employee had access to the information during employment, the report says the information was downloaded after the employee was no longer with the company.
The filing says the only potentially affected users include those in the U.S. who use Cash App Investing, which is around 8.2 million users.
Darrah advised all Cash App users update their passwords and enable two factor authentication to protect themselves from any future concerns.
USA TODAY has reached out to Cash App for comment.
