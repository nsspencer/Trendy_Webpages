     No Charges Against Police in Amir Locke Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a region still shaken by the murder of Mr. Floyd, as well as the police killing of Daunte Wright, a Black man, in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center last year, the killing of Mr. Locke reopened wounds in the community that were still raw.
Mr. Locke’s killing also brought renewed scrutiny to a department that is still depleted from the exodus of hundreds of officers in the aftermath of Mr. Floyd’s murder, and one that is still struggling to enact reforms and rebuild trust with the community.
During the investigation of the raid, Mark Hanneman, the officer who killed Mr. Locke, told investigators that when he saw Mr. Locke’s gun, he feared for his life, and that he had acted quickly because he felt his life was in jeopardy.
Mr. Hanneman, 34, was placed on administrative duty after the shooting but has since returned to his regular job, according to the Police Department.
“This is not the time for people to feel like there’s no hope,” Mr. Ellison said.

     No charges filed against Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot Amir Locke during no-knock raid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prosecutors announced Wednesday they will not file charges against the Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot Amir Locke during a no-knock raid in February, but Locke's mother vowed the case "is not over."
Officer Mark Hanneman shot Locke three times less than 10 seconds after a SWAT team entered the apartment where Locke was sleeping early in the day.
Locke's family is "deeply disappointed by the decision," according to a statement released Wednesday by the family's legal team.
"They, like us, believe that if a no-knock warrant hadn't been used, Amir Locke might well be here today," Freeman said.
Ellison called for the department to enforce the new policy and "get serious about ending in-custody deaths."

     Amir Locke: No charges will be filed in fatal police shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An officer shot Locke within a few seconds of entering the apartment after prosecutors said Locke emerged from a couch with a handgun and raised it toward an officer.
City officials didn't release a lot of information in the days after an officer shot Locke, other than 14 seconds of video that they said showed Locke with the gun.
Hanneman, the officer who shot Locke, was wearing a body-worn camera and provided a written statement to investigators.
Some renewed calls for an end to the practice of no-knock warrants following Locke's death, and many in leadership positions in departments and policing advocacy groups have said there are almost no circumstances where no-knock warrants are appropriate.
But the city did not outright ban no-knock warrants , and like most police department policies, its policy gives wide leeway to field supervisors to make decisions based on conditions they encounter and allows for no-knock warrants in certain situations.

     Police won’t be charged in shooting of Amir Locke during no-knock raid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MINNEAPOLIS — The Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot Amir Locke during a predawn, no-knock raid in February will not face charges in the killing, prosecutors announced Wednesday.
Sysaath said he saw Locke raise the barrel of his gun toward Hanneman and “believed that Mr. Locke intended to use the firearm to harm Officer Hanneman or the SWAT team.”Sgt.
In his first public statement about the shooting, Hanneman said Locke fell onto the floor when another officer kicked the couch where the man was sleeping.
Ellison said Locke’s gun appeared to be “pointed in the direction of” Hanneman, though it was unclear whether Locke was actually aiming it.
The warrant that led to Locke’s killing was not initially slated to be a no-knock raid.

     No charges filed in no-knock warrant killing of Amir Locke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota prosecutors declined to file charges Wednesday against a Minneapolis police SWAT team officer who fatally shot Amir Locke while executing an early morning no-knock search warrant in a downtown apartment in February.
It sparked protests and a reexamination of no-knock search warrants.
Some lawmakers have been pushing for a statewide ban on no-knock warrants, except in rare circumstances.
They, like us, believe that if a no-knock warrant hadn’t been used Amir Locke might well be here today,” Freeman said, declining to give further details about their conversation.
Crump faulted police for creating a life-or-death situation, and said gun rights groups should join with the family in demanding an end to no-knock warrants.

Crump also clarified that Locke “legally possessed a firearm at the time of his death.”Amir Locke’s parents confirm Locke was a legal gun owner.
We just want accountability.”Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey initially placed a “moratorium” on no-knock warrants — with exceptions.
