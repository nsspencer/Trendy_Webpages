     Why You Should Fade Cavaliers Ahead of the NBA Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It seems like forever ago that the Cleveland Cavaliers were the new kids on the block, ready to shock the conference and lead the way.
The Cavaliers are 8-14 since the All-Star break and have to play the Milwaukee Bucks and Brooklyn Nets to finish out their season.
As our Reed Wallach pointed out earlier today, the Cavaliers will likely come out of the regular season bruised and battered.
For that, I’m telling you to not trust the Cavaliers in the playoffs.
That strategy has worked sometimes, but Garland isn’t efficient enough to make it a consistent plan.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cavs would not have the tie-breaker over either the Hawks or Nets no matter what happens this last week.
The Cavs would have the tiebreaker over the Hornets if it came down to it.
Needless to say, the game in Brooklyn on Friday night will go a long way in determining if the Cavs can stay within the top eight.
A win from either team would move them to a game behind the Cavs in the standings.

     The Raptors are the Cavs’ biggest rival for the next 5 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But of all those teams you can make a strong argument why the Toronto Raptors will be the Cavaliers’ biggest rival for the next 5 years.
We’ll get further into why that could very well be the case involving the Raptors and Cavs going forward here.
The Cavs and Raptors have a well-established recent history as rivalsInterestingly enough, in the last 6 years the Cavs and Raptors have already built up some rivalry history in the playoffs.
The Cavs and Raptors first met in 2016, when it was LeBron James’ second year back in Cleveland.
The Cavs went into a complete rebuild, while the Raptors had a semi-rebuilding year in the 2020-2021 season.
