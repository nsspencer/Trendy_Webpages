     Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF slides in stock-market selloff Wednesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF is taking another bruising in the U.S. stock market selloff Wednesday, with the technology sector being hard hit amid concern the Federal Reserve is turning more hawkish in battling soaring inflation.
Shares of the ARK Innovation ETF ARKK, -4.63% , an exchange-traded fund managed by Ark Investment Management founder Wood, was down around 5% Wednesday afternoon, according to FactSet data, at last check.
The ETF, which seeks to invest in shares of companies that will benefit from “disruptive innovation,” has dropped around 33% so far this year after sliding in Tuesday’s stock market slump as well.
The central bank’s monetary tightening would include the reduction of its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet as well interest rate increases.

     Summary: “‘It’s hard to know how much the U.S. Federal Reserve will need to do to get inflation under control.
There are myriad uncertainties the Fed must navigate, he acknowledged, including the effect of easing supply-chain disruptions and a historically tight labor market.
Unlike many other economies, the U.S. doesn’t respond directly to changes in short-term interest rates, Dudley said, partly because most U.S. home buyers have long-term, fixed-rate mortgages.
The pain has been more intense in the bond market.

Markets are pricing in expectations for the Fed to raise interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points at upcoming meetings.
The renewed nervousness among investors was spurred by hawkish remarks from Fed Governor Lael Brainard and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who are both typically dovish voices.
Investors were pricing in ramped-up expectations for the Fed to raise interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points at its meetings in May and June, following up on its hike of 25 basis points in March.
Last month, the Fed raised rates from a range of 0% to 0.25% and indicated six more rate hikes were in the pipeline.

     Stock Market Today - 4/6: Dow Finishes Lower on Hawkish Fed Minutes; Tech Stocks Dive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stocks end lower following the release of the Fed minutes which suggest plans to 'expeditiously' raise interest rates while trimming the central bank's $9 trillion balance sheet.
Update at 4:20 pm ESTTech stocks lead Wall Street lower Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve said it would be prepared to reduce its $9 trillion balance sheet more quickly than forecast, minutes from the central bank's March meeting revealed.
"Participants judged that it would be appropriate to move the stance of monetary policy toward a neutral posture expeditiously," the minutes said.
"They also noted that, depending on economic and financial developments, a move to a tighter policy stance could be warranted."
That puts the Fed's $9 trillion balance sheet -- acquired by years bond purchases under its quantitative easing and pandemic support programs -- in focus.
