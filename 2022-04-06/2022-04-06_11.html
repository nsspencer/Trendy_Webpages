     Summary: The Atlanta Hawks‘ loss against the Toronto Raptors is going to have deep playoff implications.
The Hawks were in it right up until the final minutes but the Raptors were just too strong.
The Atlanta Hawks have put more pressure on themselves to win their last three games.
If the Cavaliers beat the Nets, they have to take on the Milwaukee Bucks in their final game.
Then the Hawks take on the Miami Heat who is one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference prior to the Rockets game.

Not only did they polish off a surprisingly frisky Rockets team, the Atlanta Hawks lost to the Toronto Raptors.
Meanwhile, Kyrie Irving recorded his fourth 40-point game of the season against the Houston.
Kyrie Irving was told that if the Nets win out, they'll lock the 7th seed because of key losses by teams like Atlanta.
After losing that huge game vs. Young’s Hawks last weekend, the Nets were in dire straits, relegated to the No.

Q: What are tiebreaker scenarios that could come into play?
A: Tiebreaker scenarios can get confusing, and the Hawks still have three regular-season games to go, so these might be irrelevant for the Hawks’ purposes.
But just in case, here are the first few tiebreaker scenarios if two teams finish tied.
There are tiebreaker scenarios for three-way ties, too, but there’s still a few too many regular-season games left to delve into that.
