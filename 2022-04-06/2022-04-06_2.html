    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We’ve been analyzing every frame of this new trailer for Doctor Strange 2 like it’s a dossier about the JFK assassination, and yet we’re not seeing any evidence that everyone’s favorite vampire is represented here.
Anyway, this is apparently a post about Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, so, yeah.
Peep it:Here’s a synopsis:“In Marvel Studios’ ‘Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,’ the MCU unlocks the Multiverse and pushes its boundaries further than ever before.
Here’s a question, though: do you think Doctor Strange will go to a universe where Stan Lee decided to straight-up quit Timely Comics and became a traveling vacuum salesman?
Would the world look like a bombed-out husk or would it be like Lionel Hutz’s vision of a world without lawyers?

     New Doctor Strange 2 trailer reveals another WandaVision link
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After breaking open the multiverse in Spider-Man: No Way Home, Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) appears to be finding out that totally warping reality has its consequences.
In this new promotional video for Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, the master of the mystic arts is in way over his head–but does he even remember why?
Doctor Strange hasn’t had a solo movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since his titular debut in 2016, but the character has popped up in a slew of other projects since then, hinting at the further development of his mind-bending powers.
Sorcerer Supreme Wong (Benedict Wong), friend-turned-foe Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and former co-worker/ex-girlfriend Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) all make their returns for the sequel.
Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness will be released in theaters on May 6.
