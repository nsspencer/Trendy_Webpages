Atlanta lost a tough one in Toronto, while Washington upset Minnesota on the Timberwolvesâ€™ floor.
The Wizards are playing a back-to-back after a surprising win, and I expect them to relax a little tonight.
So theyâ€™ll try to make up for last nightâ€™s loss, while the Wizards will dine on last nightâ€™s win.
