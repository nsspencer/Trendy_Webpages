Atlanta lost a tough one in Toronto, while Washington upset Minnesota on the Timberwolves’ floor.
The Wizards are playing a back-to-back after a surprising win, and I expect them to relax a little tonight.
So they’ll try to make up for last night’s loss, while the Wizards will dine on last night’s win.
