     Summary: DENVER (AP) — Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson each scored 20 points to help the San Antonio Spurs secure a spot in the play-in tournament Tuesday night following a 116-97 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
“I just didn’t think we had the requisite focus, determination, urgency, desperation — whatever adjective you want to use.
I just didn’t think we had it tonight.”Aaron Gordon echoed that sentiment.
The Nuggets cut it to four early in the fourth, only to see the Spurs go on a 14-2 surge to regain momentum.
“Every team has nights like that and I think this was one of those for the Nuggets,” Popovich said.
