     Summary: San Antonio Spurs qualify for the play-in tournamentThe San Antonio Spurs have officially qualified for the play-in tournament following a win over the NuggetsWith the loss of the Los Angeles Lakers to the Phoenix Suns, the San Antonio Spurs are officially heading into the play-in tournament, which is an excellent achievement for this young Spurs team who didn’t look like a serious threat to the 10th seed in the West.
Earlier, the Spurs defeated the Nuggets, which boosted their chances of making it to the play-in tournament, as their win made sure that the Lakers needed to win all of their remaining games to make it to the play-in tournament.
This win was a significant achievement for this San Antonio Spurs team because they were without their All-Star point guard Dejounte Murray who is sidelined due to illness and hasn’t played recently.
