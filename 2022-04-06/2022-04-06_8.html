     Prince Charles repeatedly sought Jimmy Savile’s advice, documentary claims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prince Charles repeatedly sought the advice of Jimmy Savile, who was later revealed to have spent decades sexually abusing women and children, even going so far as to take his suggestions to the Queen, a documentary has claimed.
Notes from the the Prince of Wales to Savile uncovered by the producers show that over the course of about 20 years Savile became an unofficial adviser to Charles.
The makers of the Netflix documentary Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story have revealed that Savile produced a PR handbook for royals and their staff.
Some of that advice was then incorporated in a note prepared for the Queen, the Times reported.
There is no suggestion Prince Charles knew anything about Savile’s crimes, which came to the public’s attention decades later.

     Summary: Prince Charles’ close friendship with disgraced BBC presenter Jimmy Savile is being examined in a new Netflix documentary that uncovered letters between the two.
Savile, who was exposed as a pedophile following his death in 2011 at age 84, is the subject of a new special "Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story."
We’re not suggesting for one moment that Thatcher or Prince Charles knew what he was really up to.
"The letters show the trust that Prince Charles put into Jimmy Savile.
