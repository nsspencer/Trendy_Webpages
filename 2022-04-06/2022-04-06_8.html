     Bills extend Stefon Diggs‚Äô contract
    </h2>

     Summary: Getty ImagesBills wide receiver Stefon Diggs had two years remaining on the five-year, $72 million contract.
But when the wide receiver market exploded this offseason, it became clear that Diggs was going to want a raise sooner rather than later.

     Summary: Another wide receiver got P-A-I-D.
The Buffalo Bills agreed to terms with wideout Stefon Diggs on a four-year, $96 million contract extension that can be worth more in incentives, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday morning.
Diggs will receive a $21.5 million signing bonus and $70 million in total guarantees as part of his new deal, Rapoport added.
Diggs' deal comes on the heels of Davante Adams and Tyreek Hill inking massive contracts with the Las Vegas Raiders and Miami Dolphins, respectively.
Diggs' contract puts him up there with the highest-paid wide receivers -- a position that is rolling in cash this offseason.
