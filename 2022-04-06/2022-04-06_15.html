     NXT star Nash Carter has been released by WWE
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WWE has released MSK’s Nash Carter (real name Zachary Green).
This appears to be a sudden decision because Carter is one-half of the NXT Tag Team Champions with Wes Lee and he appeared on last night’s NXT 2.0 show.
The news of Carter’s release comes after his wife Kimber Lee (formerly Abbey Laith in WWE) accused Carter of domestic abuse.
He told me I’m a wrestler so I’m always marked up.
