     Jan. 6 committee testimony forces Ivanka Trump to choose between protecting her dad and "her brand"

     Summary: Ivanka Trump spent about eight hours answering questions about the Jan. 6 insurrection in testimony before the House select committee.
Another conflict she faces is the likelihood that Ivanka Trump did not believe her father had the 2020 election stolen from him, as he claimed.
"It's difficult to imagine that Ivanka Trump actually believes the things about the stolen election that her father believes," Reilly said.
"Just generationally, she's younger, she's more internet-savvy, she's college-educated, she's probably a lot less conservative than her father.
"If he knew they were lies, that's one thing.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trump apparently appeared before the committee remotely and spoke with them for about eight hours.
Both Trump and Kushner held senior enough positions that they required top-secret security clearance for their work in the Trump White House.
Trump appeared before the committee voluntarily, Thompson told reporters, and was not there under subpoena, as several other witnesses have been.
A vote to hold both Navarro and Scavino Jr. in contempt of congress will occur today, according to the House schedule.
The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, or the January 6th Committee, is a bipartisan house committee which held its first hearing in July of 2021.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON -- Ivanka Trump, former President Donald Trump's eldest daughter, who served as one of his senior advisers, testified for about eight hours Tuesday before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, according to people familiar with the matter.
The interviews have been closed to the public as the panel conducts its work in secret.
"There won't be a subpoena," Thompson said, adding, "We've been able to validate a lot of the statements attributed to President Trump and the vice president without his specific testimony."
Thompson also indicated that the panel would not be likely to call Trump as a witness.
"I don't know anything else we could ask Donald Trump that the public doesn't already know," Thompson said.

Ivanka Trump answered questions for about eight hours on Tuesday before the panel, which had originally requested her testimony in January.
“We did not have to subpoena.”Further details of Ivanka Trump’s testimony, and its significance to the investigation, were not immediately available.
The panel has so far referred four Trump aides to the wider chamber for criminal contempt of Congress.
Ivanka Trump’s testimony follows revelations of a seven-hour gap in Trump phone logs during the Capitol violence.

     Jan. 6 Panel Questions Ivanka Trump for 8 Hours
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House panel investigating the Capitol insurrection questioned Ivanka Trump for eight hours on Tuesday, asking about her recollections of that day inside the White House with her father, former President Donald Trump.
Representative Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chairs the committee, told reporters late Tuesday afternoon that “she’s answering questions.”“I mean, not in a broad, chatty term, but she’s answering questions,” he added.
Ivanka Trump, who served as a senior White House adviser during her father’s presidency, testified virtually.
Thompson declined to discuss specifics, but said her voluntary testimony has “obviously significant value.”When asked if Ivanka Trump asserted executive privilege to avoid answering questions, Thompson said, “Not that I’m aware of.”A spokesman for Ivanka Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The panel sought to question her on conversations Donald Trump had on Jan. 6 with then-Vice President Mike Pence, and why quicker action wasn’t taken on to help stop the violence at the Capitol that day.
