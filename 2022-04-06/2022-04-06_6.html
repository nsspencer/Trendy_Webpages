     What Putin Has Said About Daughters Katerina Tikhonova, Maria Vorontsova
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Over the course of his presidency, Russia's Vladimir Putin has rarely spoken about his two daughters, Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova.
Bloomberg also reported that the European Union was planning to sanction Putin's daughters, citing unnamed sources.
In 2015, Putin held a press conference where he was asked by reporters about his daughters.
"They have their own family life," Putin says in one portion of the interviews.
"We hardly see each other, each of us has our own life," Putin said in 2013, according to the BBC.

     Why the U.S. is targeting Putin's daughters Katerina and Maria
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: REUTERS/Jakub Dabrowski/File PhotoWASHINGTON, April 6 (Reuters) - The United States' latest round of sanctions on Russia includes two new targets: Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters, Katerina and Maria, who U.S. officials believe are hiding Putin's wealth.
Putin's daughter Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova is a tech executive whose work supports the Russian government and its defense industry, according to details in the U.S. sanctions package announced on Wednesday.
"We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden with family members, and that's why we're targeting them," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The extent of Putin's wealth is a sensitive subject in Russia.
Putin's elder daughter Maria studied biology at St. Petersburg University and medicine at Moscow State University, according to the Reuters investigation.

     Who are Vladimir Putin’s daughters? Why Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova face sanctions for Ukraine war
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US has sanctioned Vladimir Putin’s two daughters in response to atrocities committed during the invasion of Ukraine.
President Putin has two adult daughters; Maria Vorontsova, 36, and, Katerina Tikhonova, 35.
Their mother is President Putin’s former wife, Lyudmila Putina, who he married in 1983 and divorced in 2014.
In 2013, Ms Tikhonova married Kirill Shamalov, the son of Nikolay Shamalov, a co-owner of Rossiya Bank.
She said sanctions had frozen more than $350bn (about £266bn) of “Putin’s war chest”, rendering unavailable about 60 per cent of the regime’s $604bn (£459bn) of foreign currency reserves.

Maria Vorontsova, who also goes as Maria Fassen, is Putin's first child and the eldest daughter.
Katerina Tikhonova, born Yekaterina Vladimirovna Putina, is the second child of the Russian president and the younger sister of Maria.
