     A new Orphan Black series is in the works at AMC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though the original Orphan Black series seemingly brought the story of Sarah Manning (Tatiana Maslany) and her sprawling family tree of sister clones to a close, AMC’s gearing up to return to their world with an all-new live-action series.
Per The Hollywood Reporter, AMC Networks has tapped Fear The Walking Dead supervising producer Anna Fishko to write and showrun Orphan Black: Echoes, a new series set in the near future of the original.
The new show, which is set to be executive produced and directed by John Fawcett, will follow the lives of a new group of women who gradually begin to realize how deeply interconnected their origins are — despite the fact that none of them know one another.
Given how the original Orphan Black came to a close, it’s unclear whether Echoes will see Maslany return to reprise any of her core Clone Club roles or one of the dozens of other Leda clones that were still living out in the world by the series finale.
Currently, Orphan Black: Echoes doesn’t have a firm release date, but AMC expects the series to premiere sometime in 2023.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The world of Orphan Black is expanding, some five years after the original series left the air.
AMC Networks has greenlit a new series, Orphan Black: Echoes, that’s set in the same fictional world as the BBC America cult favorite that ran from 2013-17.
AMC Networks announced the project in 2019, and Fishko — whose credits also include AMC’s Fear the Walking Dead and Netflix’s The Society — came aboard in February.
“Embarking on a new saga of Orphan Black with Anna, our partners at Boat Rocker, and AMC could not be more exciting,” said Fawcett.
We’re delighted to be partnering with AMC and Anna Fishko and joining forces again with John Fawcett, to boldly re-enter the Orphan Black universe.

     ‘Walking Dead’ Creator Robert Kirkman’s Profits Battle With AMC Gutted By Judge, Again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Walking Dead is coming to an end this year, and so it seems is most of the long-standing legal action by Robert Kirkman and other executive producers of the zombie apocalypse series against AMC.
In a final ruling Wednesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Buckley gutted most of the fight pitting Kirkman, Gale Anne Hurd, David Alpert and fellow TWD EPs Charles Eglee and Glen Mazzara against former home of Mad Men.
That didn’t fly high with Buckley in his second kick at this TWD can.
“Today’s ruling is a decisive blow to this overreaching case,” Orin Snyder, one of AMC’s primary attorneys, said today.
Even with the audit issues still alive and kicking for a trial, this Kirkman and company lawsuit may not be far behind.
