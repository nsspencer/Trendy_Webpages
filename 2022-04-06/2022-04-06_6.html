     Report: Bills, Stefon Diggs agree to four-year, $104M extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Buffalo wide receiver Stefon Diggs received a four-year, $104 million contract extension, ensuring the team's best threat will be catching passes from Josh Allen for years to come as the Bills seek their first championship.
ESPN reports Diggs will receive $70 million in guarantees, bringing the total value of his current contract to $124.1 million, which now runs through the 2027 season.
Diggs is just the latest wideout to receive a new contract, although he didn't get traded to receive it.
The 28-year-old Diggs will be entering his third season with the Bills, after spending the first four seasons of his NFL career with the Minnesota Vikings.
Last season, he was the fifth-most targeted receiver in the league and caught 103 passes for 1,225 yards and 10 touchdowns.

     Bills extend Stefon Diggs’ contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesBills wide receiver Stefon Diggs had two years remaining on the five-year, $72 million contract.
But when the wide receiver market exploded this offseason, it became clear that Diggs was going to want a raise sooner rather than later.
Getting a deal done with Diggs now ensures that his contract isn’t going to be a distraction.
Diggs was traded from the Vikings to the Bills in 2020 and has made the Pro Bowl in both of his seasons in Buffalo.
The Bills think Diggs and Josh Allen are going to be a winning combination for years to come.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stefon Diggs was so excited to talk about his four-year extension with the Buffalo Bills that he took one out of Matt Milano’s book.
Last offseason, Milano inked his own extension with the team.
Upon doing so, the often quiet Milano on social media took to his account and tweeted out a classic.
It was a video of actor Leonardo DiCaprio in “The Wolf of Wall Street” where he makes a NSFW comment about not leaving.
Diggs used the same, adding a “Bills Mafia” for good measure.

     Bills extending Stefon Diggs' contract making him one of highest-paid WRs, reports say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jim Kelly had 11 glorious Buffalo Bills seasons playing catch with his favorite wide receiver, Andre Reed.
And now, Josh Allen will get as many as six more seasons teaming up with his favorite target, Stefon Diggs.
There had been recent chatter - though not from Diggs - about his possible dissatisfaction with his contract which was set to expire in 2023.
The Bills are very tight against the salary cap and while the numbers aren’t yet available, it is expected that the new Diggs deal will create some space.
In his two seasons in Buffalo, Diggs has 230 catches for 2,760 yards and 18 TDs in 33 regular-season games.

     Summary: Another wide receiver got P-A-I-D.
The Buffalo Bills agreed to terms with wideout Stefon Diggs on a four-year, $96 million contract extension that can be worth more in incentives, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday morning.
Diggs will receive a $21.5 million signing bonus and $70 million in total guarantees as part of his new deal, Rapoport added.
Diggs' deal comes on the heels of Davante Adams and Tyreek Hill inking massive contracts with the Las Vegas Raiders and Miami Dolphins, respectively.
Diggs' contract puts him up there with the highest-paid wide receivers -- a position that is rolling in cash this offseason.
