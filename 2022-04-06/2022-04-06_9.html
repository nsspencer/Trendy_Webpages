     Summary: Cookies help us deliver our Services.
Learn MoreThe Chicago Fire Duo Whose Amazing Chemistry Got Their Storyline Re-WrittenWith more than 200 episodes behind it, "Chicago Fire" has a long history, with every character dealing with their fair share of heartbreak and love and everything in between over the years.
One fresh couple on the series has quickly become a fan favorite, even earning a nickname.
But if the twosome felt a bit surprising to viewers, that's because it was never in the plans for either characters' future.
One Chicago Day is a fan event that promotes NBC's One Chicago Universe shows, and in the most recent of these events, "Chicago Fire" co-showrunner Andrea Newman addressed just how that relationship blossomed while speaking to media outlets.

     Chicago Fire Team Talks Leaning Into Violet and Hawkins' Chemistry, Teases Surprising New Paramedic Partner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Chicago Fire‘s newest couple, paramedic Violet Mikami and her boss Paramedic Field Chief Evan Hawkins have certainly made an impression in their short time together.
At the same time that Violet is fretting over the fallout of her and Hawkins’ ill-timed smooch, she also gets a new paramedic partner while Brett is on leave.
Making her debut this week, Emma (played by The Fosters‘ Caitlin Carver) is “someone that I think will surprise quite a few people and will definitely surprise Violet as well,” Greensmith previewed.
She’s not a character that I think our show often has to toy with or has to battle.
So it’s going to be really interesting seeing how she weaves within the firehouse,” Greensmith teased.

     Why Chicago Fire Changed Its Plans For Violet And Hawkins, Plus Brett's Surprising Replacement

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, Fire co-showrunner Andrea Newman and Greensmith opened up about what changed and what’s ahead.
The Chicago Fire showrunners and Hanako Greensmith spoke with CinemaBlend and other outlets in honor of the 2022 One Chicago Day, and I took the opportunity to ask about the relationship between Violet Mikami and Evan Hawkins, a.k.a.
The original plan wasn’t for Violet and Hawkins to turn romantic the way that they did, but Hanako Greensmith and Jimmy Nicholas were so good together and generated such chemistry that Chicago Fire changed plans.
Hanako Greensmith previewed what to expect from Brett’s replacement, and fans are in for some surprises:Oooh, it's gonna be juicy!
See what happens next for Violet and Hawkins – as well as how Violet meshes with her new paramedic partner – with new episodes of Chicago Fire on NBC on Wednesdays at 9 p.m.
