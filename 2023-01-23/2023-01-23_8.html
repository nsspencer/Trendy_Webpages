     'Forspoken' Review: A portal into a world without wonder or heart
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken pulls from genre staples and even begins with Alice in Wonderland references, but it also falls into troubling tropes.
Put simply, Square Enix faces too many open-world competitors to get away with a poor showing like this.
/ Square Enix / Square Enix Forspoken tries to present big-budget, beautiful environments, but doesn't quite compete with rival open-world titles.
Admittedly, the combat does get more interesting as you defeat bosses and gain their abilities, but it feels dated even in comparison to its inspiration — 2016's Final Fantasy XV.
Put simply, Square Enix faces too many open-world competitors to get away with a poor showing like this.

     The Forspoken settings you should try from the start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From automating busywork to getting the notoriously chatty Cuff to talk less, here are the settings you should turn on from the start.
You can access both visual modes in the display settings menu.
By default, on PS5 at least, this feature is activated, but you can deactivate it in the sound settings menu.
The easy fix: In the accessibility settings menu, under world settings, you can turn on automatic item gathering.
If you also agree with the constituents of the 192 countries who primarily use the metric system, you can make this swap in the accessibility settings menu — it’s listed, for some reason, under the subtitle settings section.

     Forspoken is better than its bad name implies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You’re not going to believe me when I tell you this, but Forspoken is pretty good.
I became invested in Frey and her story, and I was curious as to how Forspoken would lay it all out.
I’m playing on a PS5, the most technically advanced console someone can own right now, and Forspoken felt like it was held together by wet tissue paper.
Fighting in Forspoken happens in two phases:Find which of the four elements Frey can control is powerful against your opponent.
Now listen, I know that taking this review altogether, Forspoken doesn’t seem like the best investment.

     Forspoken review: Surprises and delights, but they take a while
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ArrowRight Developer: Luminous Productions | Publisher: Square Enix Release date: Jan. 24, 2023 I didn’t expect to enjoy “Forspoken” as much as I did.
This type of speak was also common for Nathan Drake, the protagonist of the “Uncharted” series, which shares the same writer as “Forspoken,” Amy Hennig.
But a lot of things happen later in the game that make “Forspoken” just a little more special.
But at least the bigger spells land with some force.
I consider myself a pretty cynical viewer when it comes to being surprised by video game stories, yet “Forspoken” still caught me off guard.

     Forspoken review: Overshadowed by its many flaws
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken: Where to pre-orderWondering where you can pre-order Forspoken?
Thanks to Cuff, Frey has the ability to use magic and, for unknown reasons, she’s unaffected by the Break.
There’s no getting around it, not even with magic parkour: Forspoken is overshadowed — and, at times, overwhelmed — by its many flaws.
When receiving large chunks of info, typically from Cuff, Frey is riveted in place.
No replayabilityAlthough having few sidequests and minimal stats gives us a straightforward game, there is no reason to replay Forspoken.
