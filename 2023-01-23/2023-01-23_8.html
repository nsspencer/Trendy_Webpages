    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. -- Magic forward Jonathan Isaac stood at the scorer's table, had a brief talk with coach Jamahl Mosley and calmly removed his shooting shirt.
On a tight minutes restriction, Isaac finished with 10 points on 4-of-7 shooting in just under 10 minutes of action as the Magic defeated the Celtics 113-98.
As Orlando came down the court for the first time, Isaac found himself with the ball in his hands.
On the ensuing offensive possession for the Magic, Isaac was able to get the shot to go down -- a 13-footer right over Brown.
"I thought he was great," Mosley said.

     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. — Jonathan Isaac had only played with three players currently on the Orlando Magic roster, but that all changed on Monday as the sixth-year forward made his long-awaited return.
He quickly went to work, scoring on a turnaround jumper 38 seconds later for his first points of the game.
Magic coach Jamahl Mosley estimated Isaac would play about 8-10 minutes, and monitor him throughout the game.
The team ramped up his playing time each game with Isaac logging 22 minutes in his final game on Saturday.
“Since I got drafted, Jonathan was one of the first guys to text my phone after I was drafted here,” Paolo Banchero said.
