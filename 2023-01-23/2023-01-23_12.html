     Pamela Anderson Claims Tim Allen Flashed Her On “Home Improvement” Set

     Summary: @PopBase The people saying why didn’t she say anything at that time?
It was 1991 and she was a new actress who was only known for posing for Playboy… they would have blacklisted her so fast and ripped her apart in the press.
So glad she is able to tell all now.

     Pamela Anderson Says Tim Allen Flashed Her When She Was 23
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pamela Anderson’s memoir, Love, Pamela, is almost here.
In one chapter, Anderson claims that actor Tim Allen flashed his penis at her while filming the '90s sitcom, Home Improvement.
“On the first day of filming, I walked out of my dressing room, and Tim was in the hallway in his robe,” Anderson wrote.
“I would never do such a thing.”According to Variety, the accusation about Tim Allen is merely one of several shocking details about Anderson’s life to come from her memoir.
Love, Pamela will release in tandem with Anderson’s documentary, Pamela, A Love Story —which is expected to dive into Anderson's highly publicized love life.
