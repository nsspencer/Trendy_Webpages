     Antonio Conte and Harry Kane say team meeting helped Tottenham to 1-0 win over Fulham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Antonio Conte and Harry Kane have spoken about how a meeting within the Tottenham Hotspur squad helped them end a poor run of form with a 1-0 victory at Fulham on Monday night.
Spurs had won only once in five Premier League matches since the Premier League restarted after the World Cup break heading into the trip to Craven Cottage.
AdvertisementBut a well-taken effort from Kane just before half-time gave Tottenham a 1-0 win, with the 29-year-old’s 266th goal for the club drawing him level with Jimmy Greaves as their all-time record-goalscorer.

     Kane equals Greaves record to seal Tottenham win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Harry Kane became Tottenham Hotspur's joint all-time record goalscorer with the winner in his side's 1-0 victory at Fulham in the Premier League on Monday.
Kane's effort drew him level with the late Jimmy Greaves whose 266 goals came in 379 games.
Kane even had the chance to break the record after halftime but headed straight at Fulham keeper Bernd Leno.
While Tottenham have been wildly inconsistent of late, Kane remains the most reliable of goalscorers with Monday's effort taking him to 16 league goals this season.
It did not look promising for Tottenham in the early stages with Fulham, who could have gone fifth, in control.
