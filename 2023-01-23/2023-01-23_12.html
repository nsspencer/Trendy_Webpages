    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (AP) — Harry Kane became Tottenham’s joint-leading scorer of all time by netting in a 1-0 win over Fulham that moved his team three points off the Premier League’s top four on Monday.
The finish was classic Kane as he moved to 15 league goals for the season, and 199 in his career.
Tottenham stayed fifth but narrowed the gap to fourth-place Manchester United in the race for Champions League qualification.
“Clean sheets are important for us if we want to stay in the (fight for the) Champions League spots.
The Italian coach looked emotional as he punched the air in front of Tottenham’s traveling supporters after the final whistle.

     Summary: LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Harry Kane became Tottenham Hotspur's joint all-time record goalscorer with the winner in his side's 1-0 victory at Fulham in the Premier League on Monday.
Kane's effort drew him level with the late Jimmy Greaves whose 266 goals came in 379 games.
Kane even had the chance to break the record after halftime but headed straight at Fulham keeper Bernd Leno.
While Tottenham have been wildly inconsistent of late, Kane remains the most reliable of goalscorers with Monday's effort taking him to 16 league goals this season.
It did not look promising for Tottenham in the early stages with Fulham, who could have gone fifth, in control.
