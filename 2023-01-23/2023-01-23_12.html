     Alex Murdaugh goes on trial in 2021 killings of wife, son
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: THE KILLINGS AND EVIDENCEMurdaugh, 54, told police he found Maggie, 52, and their son, Paul, 22, dead outside their Colleton County home on June 7, 2021.
Authorities released little information about the killings beyond saying that Maggie Murdaugh was killed with a rifle and Paul Murdaugh with a shotgun.
There is a video from Paul Murdaugh's phone with a timestamp not long before the killings.
Prosecutors said the killings gave Murdaugh sympathy and, more importantly, allowed him to hide his thefts and other crimes.
Police said Paul Murdaugh was driving the boat while grossly intoxicated and he faced criminal charges when the teen died.
