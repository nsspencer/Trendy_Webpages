     Eagles-49ers: 10 early stats to know for NFC Championship Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Eagles are one win away from returning to the Super Bowl and they’ll face a familiar foe in the NFC Championship game when the San Francisco 49ers head to Lincoln Financial Field next Sunday at 3:00 pm.
The two teams last met in Week 2 of the 2021 regular season, with San Francisco defeating Philadelphia 17-11 as Jimmy Garoppolo threw one touchdown pass and ran in for another score.
All-Pro quarterback Jalen Hurts had an uneven performance in the loss, completing just 12 of 23 passes for 190 yards.
Both teams are far different from that Week 2 matchup and the Eagles are much more explosive on offense after the addition of A.J.
With preparation set to begin, we’re looking at ten early stats to know for the NFC Championship Game.
