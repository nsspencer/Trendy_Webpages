     'Forspoken' Review: A portal into a world without wonder or heart
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken pulls from genre staples and even begins with Alice in Wonderland references, but it also falls into troubling tropes.
Put simply, Square Enix faces too many open-world competitors to get away with a poor showing like this.
/ Square Enix / Square Enix Forspoken tries to present big-budget, beautiful environments, but doesn't quite compete with rival open-world titles.
Admittedly, the combat does get more interesting as you defeat bosses and gain their abilities, but it feels dated even in comparison to its inspiration — 2016's Final Fantasy XV.

     Summary: You’re not going to believe me when I tell you this, but Forspoken is pretty good.
I became invested in Frey and her story, and I was curious as to how Forspoken would lay it all out.
I’m playing on a PS5, the most technically advanced console someone can own right now, and Forspoken felt like it was held together by wet tissue paper.
Fighting in Forspoken happens in two phases:Find which of the four elements Frey can control is powerful against your opponent.
Now listen, I know that taking this review altogether, Forspoken doesn’t seem like the best investment.

     Forspoken review: Surprises and delights, but they take a while

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ArrowRight Developer: Luminous Productions | Publisher: Square Enix Release date: Jan. 24, 2023 I didn’t expect to enjoy “Forspoken” as much as I did.
This type of speak was also common for Nathan Drake, the protagonist of the “Uncharted” series, which shares the same writer as “Forspoken,” Amy Hennig.
But a lot of things happen later in the game that make “Forspoken” just a little more special.
But at least the bigger spells land with some force.
I consider myself a pretty cynical viewer when it comes to being surprised by video game stories, yet “Forspoken” still caught me off guard.

     How Big Forspoken's Map Size Is Compared To BOTW &amp; Elden Ring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken will take players away to the fantasy land of Athia, but it will take a lot to match the open worlds of Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild.
Elden Ring and BOTW have been hailed as two of the greatest open-world games ever released, with both entries boasting large, vibrant landscapes filled with mysteries to solve and enemies to encounter.
Although Forspoken hasn't received the same level of hype or attention as Elden Ring or BOTW, its open world is set to be one of the biggest seen on the PlayStation 5.
Reddit user AbUndMax used map markers and the demo's overworld map to determine what players can expect with the full release.
Elden Ring and Zelda: BOTW allow players to navigate their maps in any order they choose, and it can take roughly 50 to 60 hours to discover fully.

     Forspoken Review - Forsaken
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Forspoken, protagonist Frey finds herself trapped in the magic-filled world of Athia after stumbling through a portal.
However, it's not a world that the game is able to adequately convince the player of wanting to stay in and protect.
As a result, Forspoken feels disjointed as the moments of exploration and navigation come into conflict with combat.
Forspoken doesn't do anything to celebrate Frey as someone who is Black or a woman or anything else about her.
Forspoken is a tricky game to recommend.

     Summary: Forspoken: Where to pre-orderWondering where you can pre-order Forspoken?
Thanks to Cuff, Frey has the ability to use magic and, for unknown reasons, she’s unaffected by the Break.
There’s no getting around it, not even with magic parkour: Forspoken is overshadowed — and, at times, overwhelmed — by its many flaws.
When receiving large chunks of info, typically from Cuff, Frey is riveted in place.
No replayabilityAlthough having few sidequests and minimal stats gives us a straightforward game, there is no reason to replay Forspoken.
