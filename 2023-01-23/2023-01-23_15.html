     Knicks Fans Thrilled by Win vs. Donovan Mitchell, Cavs After NY's Offseason Interest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elsa/Getty ImagesOne of the top storylines of the 2022 offseason was the New York Knicks' reported interest in trading for three-time All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell.
Such was the case during Tuesday night's matchup at Madison Square Garden, as Knicks fans reveled in a 105-103 win that saw Mitchell come up short multiple times in crucial moments.
Failing to acquire a superstar like Mitchell understandably still had Knicks fans feeling disappointed, so Tuesday's win was extra special.
Fans on Twitter made sure to celebrate New York's victory at Mitchell's expense:Tuesday's win was New York's second victory over Cleveland on its home floor, and the team now leads the season series 2-1.
Mitchell and the Cavs (29-20) will look to get back on track when they visit the Houston Rockets (11-36) on Thursday.

     Groin injury, turnovers haunt Cavs' Mitchell in loss to Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK -- Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell was unsure about his status moving forward after his groin tightened up on the final play of Cleveland's 105-103 loss to the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night.
"It felt the same as before," said Mitchell, who had missed the prior three games with groin tightness.
He later said he not only was dealing with groin tightness, but also cramping in both legs, all of which happened on that final drive.
"It's definitely both [frustration about the injury and his play], but more so [the injury].
But, from his vantage point, Mitchell said the loss was solely on his shoulders.

     The Knicks’ Bench Has Lost Their Spark
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For two years, the Knicks’ bench, led by Immanuel Quickley and others, was their ace in the hole.
Last season, that was the reliability with which the New York Knicks’ bench played.
They were ranked highly amongst bench lineups across the NBA and were often the closers for games when the Knicks’ starters simply could not find their footing on either side of the floor.
With Grimes stepping into the starting lineup permanently and head coach Tom Thibodeau opting for what seems like a seven- to nine-man rotation, bench players are stretched thin.

     Summary: There are reports within NBA circles that the Los Angeles Clippers could be interested in reuniting with their former backup center Isaiah Hartenstein.
According to executives around the league, the Clippers are also interested in their former backup center Isaiah Hartenstein, who is now with the Knicks, per @KevinOConnorNBA.
In 48 games this season, Hartenstein has averaged 4.9 points and six rebounds in 18.4 minutes per game.
In the scenario the Knicks do trade Hartenstein, there are a few names to look at on the Clippers roster.
At six foot seven, he can be a valuable player for a Knicks team that needs wings.
