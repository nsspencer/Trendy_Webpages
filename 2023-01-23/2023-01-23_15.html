Fans will soon find out which of this year's biggest movies and film stars could be taking home awards at the 95th Academy Awards, as the 2023 Oscar nominations will be announced on Jan. 24.

Not to mention, stars like Austin Butler, Michelle Yeoh and Brendan Fraser could land their first Oscar nominations after taking home Golden Globes and Critics' Choice wins in the Best Actor and Actress categories.
