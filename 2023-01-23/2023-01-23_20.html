     Warriors fumble away another win in loss to Nets at home
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors collapsed down the stretch in a 120-116 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.
This stunning home loss means the Dubs were swept by the Nets, which is even more ridiculous since Brooklyn didn’t have their best player Kevin Durant last night.
We saw it most recently in the loss to Boston when the team squandered a late lead and went into overtime.
Stephen Curry in particular had a rough fourth quarter, going 0-for-4 in the final frame as his team was outscored 34-26.
Okay DNHQ, we’re over the halfway point of January and the team can’t quite get above .500 consistently.

     Nets' Not Shying Away From Opponents Intentionally Fouling Nic Claxton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets don't plan on shying away from opponents intentionally fouling Nic Claxton and want to use it to their own benefit.
Brooklyn Nets fourth-year big Nic Claxton is having a career year across almost all categories.
"I definitely take it as a challenge," Claxton told reporters following the Nets' 120-116 victory at Golden State Sunday night.
If a team wants to use that strategy (intentionally fouling) he'll continue to gain confidence in getting to the line and shooting.
He'll continue to be out there if a team wants to take that strategy."

     Nets' Nic Claxton says Warriors 'weren't ready to play' after Sunday's win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn Nets center Nic Claxton has done a considerable amount of talking this season.
In Sunday’s 120-116 win over the Golden State Warriors, Claxton had 24 points, 15 rebounds, and three blocks while playing a big part in the Nets coming back from being down as many as 17 points in the contest.
Claxton was all over the court as he was finishing strong at the basket and protecting the rim with the best of them against the smaller Warriors.
Claxton’s career-highs in points and rebounds were a testament to how much he has improved from last season to this season and how his confidence grows with each game.
Claxton spoke immediately after the final buzzer about why Brooklyn was able to pull off this upset:

     Royce O’Neale’s late 3-pointer lifts Nets past Warriors 120-116
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Royce O’Neale walked gingerly onto the podium with an ice bag around each knee and reiterated the soaring confidence level among the Brooklyn Nets even with star Kevin Durant on the sidelines nursing a knee injury.
Irving missed another try but Golden State got two more chances and both Curry and Kevon Looney missed with less than a minute left.
Irving’s 3-pointer at the 6:55 mark of the third tied the game and the Warriors led 90-86 heading into the final 12 minutes.
Warriors: The Warriors dropped to 8-2 at home against teams with winning records coming into the game.
… Golden State has hit 15 or more 3s in 12 straight games.

     Nets’ Jacque Vaughn says Sunday’s win over Warriors was ‘evidence’ of Nets figuring things out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn Nets head Jacque Vaughn has been trying to change the culture of the team ever since he took over for Steve Nash earlier this season.
Vaughn is big on keeping things simple and is even bigger on trust.
In the first half, Brooklyn had trouble keeping up with Golden State in transition and that led to the Warriors getting points in bunches.
Things changed in the second half as the Nets were able to limit the Warriors’ transition opportunities and curtailed what they were able to do in the paint.
And, so, that’s evidence to our guys what it looks like down the stretch, what our defense looks like.
