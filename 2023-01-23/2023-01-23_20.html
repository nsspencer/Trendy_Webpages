     Jonathan Isaac Will Make His NBA Return in Orlando Magic’s Home Game Against Boston Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO – It’s been 904 days, a period of time spanning across four different seasons, since Jonathan Isaac played in NBA action.
Isaac is expected to return to the floor from a devastating left knee injury when the Orlando Magic host the Boston Celtics tonight at 7 p.m.
After missing the last two-and-a-half seasons, Isaac recently took a major step in his rehab process by playing with Orlando’s G League affiliate, the Lakeland Magic.
IN AND OUT: Orlando will be without Kevon Harris (G League – Two-Way), Caleb Houstan (G League – On Assignment) and Chuma Okeke (left knee surgery) on Monday night.
For Boston, Robert Williams III (left knee injury management) is questionable, while Malcolm Brogdon (personal reasons), Danilo Gallinari (left knee; ACL repair) and Marcus Smart (right ankle sprain) are out.

     Paolo Banchero, Magic react to Jonathan Isaac's long-awaited return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO, Fla. — Jonathan Isaac had only played with three players currently on the Orlando Magic roster, but that all changed on Monday as the sixth-year forward made his long-awaited return.
He quickly went to work, scoring on a turnaround jumper 38 seconds later for his first points of the game.
Magic coach Jamahl Mosley estimated Isaac would play about 8-10 minutes, and monitor him throughout the game.
The team ramped up his playing time each game with Isaac logging 22 minutes in his final game on Saturday.
“Since I got drafted, Jonathan was one of the first guys to text my phone after I was drafted here,” Paolo Banchero said.
