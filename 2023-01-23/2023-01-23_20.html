     Summary: The Chicago Bulls have won 10 of their last 16 games and are currently 10th in the Eastern Conference with a 21-24 record.
The question is, can the Bulls make a late-season push to reach the playoffs?
While Dosunmu and Williams have shown flashes of their potential, consistency has eluded both players.
Dosunmu, in particular, plays a crucial role in the grand scheme of things for the Bulls.
The Bulls need Williams to be consistent if they are going to make a playoff push.

     Still some uncertainty with Bulls forward Javonte Green’s knee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “He hasn’t done any running or jumping,’’ coach Billy Donovan said when asked about a Bull’s injury status.
And, no, for the first time in almost a year, it wasn’t guard Lonzo Ball he was talking about.
He was referring to forward Javonte Green, who had minor exploratory surgery two weeks ago on his right knee and is still on the road back.
The length of that journey was still up in the air, especially after the latest update from Donovan.
He was in and out of games after that but never as a starter because of the knee problems and a minutes restriction.
