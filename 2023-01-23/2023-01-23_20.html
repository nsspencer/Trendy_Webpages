     Longtime Braves broadcaster Chip Caray leaving Atlanta for same role with Cardinals: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BackstoryCaray is leaving the Braves position entirely by his choice, a source said, adding that the pull of going “home” to St. Louis was strong.
He told The Athletic he rarely saw his father, legendary broadcaster Skip Caray, after he went to Atlanta to work as a Braves broadcaster in 1976.
“I would say that’s part of the mix.”With Caray, the Cardinals gain a legacy in sports broadcasting and a St. Louis native.
Caray, who was born in 1965, spent the majority of his childhood in the greater St. Louis area.
With Chip Caray leaving, it will end a run of 46 years with at least one Caray in the Braves’ broadcast booth.
