     Musk said he could have funded a Tesla buyout with SpaceX shares
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk testified Monday that he was not only certain he’d have the backing from Saudi financiers to take Tesla private in 2018, but also that he could have sold enough shares of his rocket company SpaceX to fund a buyout.
Musk nodded toward his sales of Tesla stock to buy Twitter, and said he would have considered doing the same thing to make the deal to take Tesla private go through.
“So the concerns would be if Musk took this company private, could the person who owns two shares of Tesla and has a low-paying job remain an investor?
During the trial on Monday, Musk provided details about certain special purpose vehicles that are available to SpaceX investors — SpaceX being a private company — that Musk supposedly wanted to replicate with his take-private deal with Tesla.
Regardless, the plaintiff’s lawyers demonstrated through exhibits from Goldman Sachs and other investors that there were limitations on keeping retail investors involved in a private Tesla.

     Summary: Tesla Inc. TSLA, +7.74% stock added to a rally Monday as Chief Executive Elon Musk took the witness stand in a federal trial in San Francisco revolving around his “funding secured” tweets in 2018.
The stock gained more than 6% in midday trading as Musk in court says that he believed he had an agreement with Saudi Arabia’s investment fund that would be more than sufficient to take the EV maker private.
Musk testified briefly on Friday, but court adjourned.
The trial is expected to go into February.

     Summary: Elon Musk told a San Francisco federal court on Monday that he could have sold shares of SpaceX to take Tesla private in 2018.
Trading in Tesla was halted after his tweets, and its share price remained volatile for weeks.
Musk said under oath, "SpaceX stock alone meant 'funding secured' by itself.
I sold Tesla stock to complete the Twitter transaction.
Musk recently became the CEO of social media business Twitter after leading a $44 billion leveraged buyout of the company in October 2022.

     Summary: Sadly for Musk, the tweet cost him $20 million in fines and he was forced to step down as Tesla’s executive chairman.
“My understanding was that they would proceed with the deal,” Musk said.
“420 price was not a joke,” he said.
And while it’s unclear just how much of a “head” Musk is, he famously got high after some gentle nudging by cool guy Joe Rogan.
Lead plaintiff Glen Littleton found Musk’s assertions dubious, testifying that he had lost 75 percent of his investment following the Tesla chief’s “Funding Secured” tweet.

     Summary: Tesla's (TSLA 7.74%) electric vehicle business leads the industry and is coming off a fantastic year of growth in deliveries to customers with more production capacity than ever before.
Here's why Tesla stock is a buy either way.
Related to its cars, Tesla has developed its own fully autonomous self-driving software, which it sells as an optional extra.
That, for example, is a key differentiator compared with other electric vehicle makers that outsource the technology to companies like Nvidia.
So investors might want to take advantage of the discount in Tesla stock by buying now and holding for the long run.

     Summary: Porritt pointed out that Musk had told Tesla employees at the time he expected his stake in Tesla to remainsimilar after the deal.
Musk added later that he chose not to take Tesla private due to a lack of support from some investors and a wish to avoid a lengthy process.
Musk told Porritt that he met on July 31, 2018, with representatives of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California.
That never came to pass, Musk said, because the fund's governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, later backpedaled on the commitment to take Tesla private.
"I was very upset because he had been unequivocal in his support for taking Tesla private when we met and now he appeared to be backpedaling," Musk testified.

     Summary: Elon Musk said he could've sold his SpaceX shares to take Tesla private when he took the witness stand again to defend his 2018 "funding secured" tweets in a lawsuit filed by the automaker's shareholders.
According to CNBC, Musk proclaimed: "SpaceX stock alone meant 'funding secured' by itself.
It's not that I want to sell SpaceX stock but I could have, and if you look at the Twitter transaction — that is what I did.
The plaintiffs' lawsuit is based on Musk's infamous 2018 tweets in which he said he was "considering taking Tesla private at $420."
This time, Musk reiterated his previous claim that he had an agreement with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund to take Tesla private.
