     What's different about CBS News Detroit's TV broadcast, launching Monday evening
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President and general manager Brian Watson says a few things will set this new broadcast apart from what Metro Detroit television news viewers are used to seeing.
The on-air evening news team includes anchors Shaina Humphries and Jeff Skversky, sportscaster Ronnie Duncan and meteorologist Ahmad Bajjey.
Watson says the visuals of CBS News Detroit's broadcasts will be different than what viewers are used to.
"It is an all-in-one newsroom where the producers, the anchors, the assignment editors, the E.P.s ... everybody is in one working newsroom and you see it all there," Watson said.
While the evening broadcasts kick off this week, CBS News Detroit will add morning and afternoon broadcasts to the schedule along with live streaming-only broadcasts.

     CBS News Detroit to debut 2 local weeknight newscasts, with plans for more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A little more than a year after announcing plans to get back into TV news, the Motor City's CBS station is rolling out broadcasts with a new strategy.
A year and one month after announcing plans to become a major player in local TV news, Detroit’s CBS station is ready to roll out two newscasts.
“That’s going to create those relationships and … create the loyalty that Detroit viewers have.”And Makupson knows something about loyalty, particularly because her mother is a popular Detroit broadcast legend also named Amyre Makupson.
During the initial rollout, the CBS News Detroit website will be showing the national CBS News streaming channel when it’s not simulcasting the two local weeknight news shows.
There are 21 on-air news staffers pictured on the CBS Detroit website, many with Detroit or Michigan ties.

     CBS News Detroit Aims to Reinvent Local News
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Initially, the station is launching tonight, Jan. 23, with weekday newscasts broadcast at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. that will also be live streamed on the CBS News Detroit streaming channel.
Eventually, there will be a 24/7 live streaming CBS News Detroit channel that is live most of the day, much like their 13 other local news streaming channels.
“CBS News Detroit really is [our] answer to the question: What do you do if you could build a newsroom from scratch?” Roark added.
Currently CBS Detroit has 14 community-based journalists spread out through its DMA, including one in Lansing Mich., which is the capital of the state, to cover politics, explained Paul Pytlowany, vice president and news director at CBS Detroit.
Based on input from their multimedia journalists, CBS Detroit removed the front passenger seat and created a mobile editing station.
