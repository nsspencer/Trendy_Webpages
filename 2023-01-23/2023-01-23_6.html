    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More importantly, the Grizzlies are below .500 on the road at 11-12, and they have a 5-10 road record against Western Conference teams on the road.
Road struggles are sweeping throughout the Western Conference this season, but this wasn't expected to happen in Memphis.
Even though the Grizzlies are struggling on the road by their standards, they still have the seventh-best road win percentage in the NBA.
Opponents average 108 points per game at FedExForum, but that number jumps to 115.1 when Memphis is on the road.
If Memphis wants to remain at the top of the West, winning on the road could be a separator.

     Summary: The Kings are playing very good basketball, despite losing their last game against the 76ers.
Fast Start in the First QuarterIn January, the Kings have the best first quarter offensive rating in the NBA while the Grizzlies have the second best defensive rating.
Otherwise, Memphis will likely fall behind early, and will have a tough task of catching up with the explosive Kings.
The Grizzlies own three point shooting continues to be inconsistent, so its is critical for the Grizzlies limit good looks for the Kings.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shannon Sharpe’s sideline tirade directed toward the Memphis Grizzlies turned the retired NFL tight end and Undisputed co-host into a trending figure during Friday night’s NBA on ESPN matchup.
Sharpe’s feud with the Grizzlies just before halftime distracted from what was an otherwise entertaining game and on Monday’s show, Sharpe opened Undisputed with an apology for his behavior.
During a three-minute opening mea culpa, Sharpe apologized to the fans, Jeanie Buss, the Lakers organization, the Grizzlies, Dillon Brooks, Ja Morant, LeBron James, his network, and even his stylist for the unwanted attention.
Sharpe’s attempt to take on the entire Grizzlies team, a new take on man vs. bear (I’m taking the man), turned the host into a polarizing figure.
Reserve at Samsung AdvertisementWTAs usual though, fireworks from the Undisputed co-hosts have been good for their show’s visibility.
