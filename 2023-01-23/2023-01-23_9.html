     Two Warnings About These ‘Forspoken’ Reviews
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken Credit: Square EnixThe reviews for Square Enix’s new open-world action-adventure game Forspoken are in, and as my colleague Paul Tassi reports: They are bad.
I have two things to say about this—two warnings, if you will:First, the reviews are currently for PS5 only.
Without any reviews for the game’s PC performance, I can only fear the worse.
Truly awful writing, bad line delivery (though this is likely more about the writing than the actors) and it’s pretty constant.
Video impressions and gameplay below:As always, I’d love it if you’d follow me here on this blog and subscribe to my YouTube channel and my Substack so you can stay up-to-date on all my TV, movie and video game reviews and coverage.

     'Forspoken' Review: A portal into a world without wonder or heart
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken pulls from genre staples and even begins with Alice in Wonderland references, but it also falls into troubling tropes.
Put simply, Square Enix faces too many open-world competitors to get away with a poor showing like this.
/ Square Enix / Square Enix Forspoken tries to present big-budget, beautiful environments, but doesn't quite compete with rival open-world titles.
Admittedly, the combat does get more interesting as you defeat bosses and gain their abilities, but it feels dated even in comparison to its inspiration — 2016's Final Fantasy XV.

     Summary: You’re not going to believe me when I tell you this, but Forspoken is pretty good.
I became invested in Frey and her story, and I was curious as to how Forspoken would lay it all out.
I’m playing on a PS5, the most technically advanced console someone can own right now, and Forspoken felt like it was held together by wet tissue paper.
Fighting in Forspoken happens in two phases:Find which of the four elements Frey can control is powerful against your opponent.
Now listen, I know that taking this review altogether, Forspoken doesn’t seem like the best investment.

     Forspoken review: Surprises and delights, but they take a while
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ArrowRight Developer: Luminous Productions | Publisher: Square Enix Release date: Jan. 24, 2023 I didn’t expect to enjoy “Forspoken” as much as I did.
This type of speak was also common for Nathan Drake, the protagonist of the “Uncharted” series, which shares the same writer as “Forspoken,” Amy Hennig.
But a lot of things happen later in the game that make “Forspoken” just a little more special.
But at least the bigger spells land with some force.
I consider myself a pretty cynical viewer when it comes to being surprised by video game stories, yet “Forspoken” still caught me off guard.

     How Big Forspoken's Map Size Is Compared To BOTW &amp; Elden Ring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken will take players away to the fantasy land of Athia, but it will take a lot to match the open worlds of Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild.
Elden Ring and BOTW have been hailed as two of the greatest open-world games ever released, with both entries boasting large, vibrant landscapes filled with mysteries to solve and enemies to encounter.
Although Forspoken hasn't received the same level of hype or attention as Elden Ring or BOTW, its open world is set to be one of the biggest seen on the PlayStation 5.
Reddit user AbUndMax used map markers and the demo's overworld map to determine what players can expect with the full release.
Elden Ring and Zelda: BOTW allow players to navigate their maps in any order they choose, and it can take roughly 50 to 60 hours to discover fully.

     Forspoken review: Overshadowed by its many flaws

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken: Where to pre-orderWondering where you can pre-order Forspoken?
Thanks to Cuff, Frey has the ability to use magic and, for unknown reasons, she’s unaffected by the Break.
There’s no getting around it, not even with magic parkour: Forspoken is overshadowed — and, at times, overwhelmed — by its many flaws.
When receiving large chunks of info, typically from Cuff, Frey is riveted in place.
No replayabilityAlthough having few sidequests and minimal stats gives us a straightforward game, there is no reason to replay Forspoken.
