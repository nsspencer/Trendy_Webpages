     Duke basketball's Kyle Filipowski took throat punch and threw up. No foul was called. Why?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Duke freshman Kyle Filipowski took an accidental punch to the throat from Virginia Tech's MJ Collins as he celebrated an eventual game-winning jumper with 13.6 left in Monday night's game.
Morris' celebratory fist pump connected with Filipowski, who doubled over in surprise pain before officials stopped the game for an injury timeout.
Duke coach Jon Scheyer said Filipowski got hit so hard that he was throwing up in the huddle after the play.
A flagrant 1 call would've given Filipowski two free throws before giving the ball back to Virginia Tech with Duke trailing 77-75.
Whitehead left Monday’s game with 17:09 left in the second half with a lower leg injury and never returned.

     Duke basketball: Dariq Whitehead suffers another injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three minutes into the second half of the Duke basketball team's road battle against the Virginia Tech Hokies on Monday night, Blue Devil freshman Dariq Whitehead landed awkwardly while pursuing a loose ball, seemingly injuring his left ankle.
Just before the under-12 timeout, the ESPN broadcast reported that Whitehead had a lower leg injury and was doubtful to return.
Whitehead, a projected one-and-one but averaging only 8.3 points per game entering the contest, was on pace for an impressive point total against the Hokies.
Dariq Whitehead has already missed four Duke basketball games this season.

     Summary: 17 Miami Hurricanes in Durham, the Duke basketball squad is in Blacksburg to play the unranked Virginia Tech Hokies (11-8, 1-7 ACC) at 7 p.m.
Although this Virginia Tech squad is struggling, it's worth noting Duke has left with a loss in four of its past five trips to Cassell Coliseum, including the most recent visit in 2021.
Furthermore, the Hokies defeated the Blue Devils in last season's ACC Tournament championship game, 82-67, and this is their first meeting since.

     Duke basketball freshman Dariq Whitehead leaves ACC game at Virginia Tech with injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Duke freshman Dariq Whitehead suffered an injury to his left leg during the second half of the Blue Devils’ 78-75 loss at Virginia Tech on Monday night.
Projected as a first-round pick in June’s NBA Draft, the 6-7 Whitehead suffered what the team called a lower leg injury and didn’t play over the final 17:10.
After the game, Duke coach Jon Scheyer said he hadn’t had a chance to get a full report from the team’s medical staff, so he was uncertain about Whitehead’s availability.
Whitehead immediately reached for the back of his left leg and began limping.
He scored 10 points on 4 of 6 shooting against Virginia Tech prior to his injury.

     Summary: Duke freshman and former five-star prospect Dariq Whitehead suffered a lower-leg injury during Monday's 78-75 loss at Virginia Tech.
Whitehead left the game early in the second half after landing awkwardly on his left leg.
He was helped off the court, unable to put any pressure on his injury, and did not return to the game.
The injury came with 17:20 left in the second half as Duke trailed 47-45.
He hopped to his feet to finish out the offensive play from Virginia Tech but checked right out of the game when the possession changed.
