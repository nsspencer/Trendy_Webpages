     Summary: Forspoken was shorter than I thought it was going to be.
Prior to the game’s release, Forspoken co-director Takashi Terada suggested that it would take 30–40 hours to complete the game’s story, but that was not my experience.
As noted in my review, I completed the story and a healthy (if not completionist) amount of side content in roughly 16 hours.
Over at Polygon sister site The Verge, Ash Parrish finished the main story in roughly 17 hours.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken offers players plenty of options, both when it comes to the difficulty settings and the graphical performance of the game on PS5 and PC.
As a result, those looking for the best image quality or difficulty settings in Forspoken really are spoiled for choice.
What is the Best Difficulty Setting in Forspoken?
The best difficulty setting in Forspoken will vary from player to player, though for most, "Default" will likely prove to be the best option.
There's no punishment for doing so either, with none of Forspoken's Trophies/Achievements being tied to one particular difficulty setting.

     Summary: From automating busywork to getting the notoriously chatty Cuff to talk less, here are the settings you should turn on from the start.
You can access both visual modes in the display settings menu.
By default, on PS5 at least, this feature is activated, but you can deactivate it in the sound settings menu.
The easy fix: In the accessibility settings menu, under world settings, you can turn on automatic item gathering.
If you also agree with the constituents of the 192 countries who primarily use the metric system, you can make this swap in the accessibility settings menu — it’s listed, for some reason, under the subtitle settings section.

     Summary: Forspoken pulls from genre staples and even begins with Alice in Wonderland references, but it also falls into troubling tropes.
Put simply, Square Enix faces too many open-world competitors to get away with a poor showing like this.
/ Square Enix / Square Enix Forspoken tries to present big-budget, beautiful environments, but doesn't quite compete with rival open-world titles.
Admittedly, the combat does get more interesting as you defeat bosses and gain their abilities, but it feels dated even in comparison to its inspiration — 2016's Final Fantasy XV.

If you’re hopping on the train early (Forspoken is currently out for PlayStation 5 and PC), here are nine things you should know before starting.
Throughout Forspoken, it’s worth accruing as much equipment as possible, even if you don’t plan on using it.
Every cloak and necklace comes with a unique perk; once unlocked, you can then apply that perk to other cloaks or necklaces at crafting stations.

     Summary: ArrowRight Developer: Luminous Productions | Publisher: Square Enix Release date: Jan. 24, 2023 I didn’t expect to enjoy “Forspoken” as much as I did.
This type of speak was also common for Nathan Drake, the protagonist of the “Uncharted” series, which shares the same writer as “Forspoken,” Amy Hennig.
But a lot of things happen later in the game that make “Forspoken” just a little more special.
But at least the bigger spells land with some force.
I consider myself a pretty cynical viewer when it comes to being surprised by video game stories, yet “Forspoken” still caught me off guard.

     Summary: Here are some tips to help you through the first few hours of the game.
Forspoken is a hectic blend of open-world environments, a hectic combat system, and a parkour game, with everything that those three descriptors would entail.
RELATED: Games With Amazing Dynamic Weather EffectsGetting to grips with Forspoken can take a while, especially as the game drip-feeds you new abilities gradually.
Don't Bite Off More Than You Can ChewAs an open-world game, the difficulty of the challenges you'll find as you explore are not necessarily linear.
The Importance Of Spellcraft ChallengesVery early in the game, you'll unlock spellcraft challenges in Cipal.

     Summary: Here’s exactly how many hours to can expect to spend with Forspoken.
Forspoken’s main story is actually surprisingly short, especially compared to most of Square Enix’s other RPG offerings.
If you’re simply looking to mainline the story and do nothing else, you can beat the game in roughly 12-15 hours.
Forspoken is split up into thirteen different story chapters, although the length of these chapters can vary wildly.
Story focused-chapters can be over in 30 minutes, while chapters that dump you into the open world can take hours upon hours.

     Summary: Forspoken: Where to buyWondering where you can buy Forspoken?
Thanks to Cuff, Frey has the ability to use magic and, for unknown reasons, she’s unaffected by the Break.
There’s no getting around it, not even with magic parkour: Forspoken is overshadowed — and, at times, overwhelmed — by its many flaws.
When receiving large chunks of info, typically from Cuff, Frey is riveted in place.
No replayabilityAlthough having few sidequests and minimal stats gives us a straightforward game, there is no reason to replay Forspoken.

     Forspoken Review - Forsaken
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Forspoken, protagonist Frey finds herself trapped in the magic-filled world of Athia after stumbling through a portal.
However, it's not a world that the game is able to adequately convince the player of wanting to stay in and protect.
As a result, Forspoken feels disjointed as the moments of exploration and navigation come into conflict with combat.
Forspoken doesn't do anything to celebrate Frey as someone who is Black or a woman or anything else about her.
Forspoken is a tricky game to recommend.
