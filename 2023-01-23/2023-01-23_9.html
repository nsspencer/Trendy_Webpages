Credit:FairfaxBut the online world is very different from writing a book.
But that’s not my focus, my focus is helping survivors know there is hope.
My focus is to also take a strong stand against online abuse and set an example for the next generation of young boys and girls, who are stepping into a world where online bullying is sadly such a big part of their lives to navigate.
I’d like to encourage and educate them on what’s not OK, and how to deal with it.

    </h2>

     Summary: Australian tennis great Jelena Dokic is speaking out about some of the "evil" messages she's gotten recently about her body.
The former Australian tennis star, 39, who was a commentator for the Australian Open over the weekend, shared an Instagram post that highlighted a number of people who criticized her body during an interview with nine-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic.
Kindness and being a good person matters which those of you that abuse me and others, are clearly not."
