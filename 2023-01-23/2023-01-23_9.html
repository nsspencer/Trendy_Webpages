     Yes, That Really Was Doja Cat Covered in 30,000 Crystals at Schiaparelli
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Spring 2023 couture shows kicked off in Paris with a visual spectacle at Schiaparelli.
Inspired by Dante Alighieri’s Inferno, the show saw supermodels Shalom Harlow, Irina Shayk, and Naomi Campbell glide down the catwalk in looks adorned with animal heads made from foam.
Photo: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.com“Schiaparelli’s collection is a beguiling blend of femininity and masculinity,” says makeup artist Pat McGrath.
“Evocative of sublime sculptures; a true feast for the eyes.”And then there’s Doja Cat.
“Her patience and dedication as she sat with Team Pat McGrath and I for four hours and 58 minutes to achieve the creation, covered in over 30,000 hand-applied Swarovski crystals, was truly inspiring.”

     The Doja Cat–Approved Brand Using Metal as Fabric
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In her music video for the hit “Woman,” Doja Cat appears wearing a silver metal beaded two-piece set.
The outfit itself—a kind of seductive and skin-baring chainmail—and the eight others like it in the music video are mesmerizing.
Today Jeniece Blanchet—the designer behind them and the label Jèblanc—is releasing her first ready-to-wear collection, Light.
Last September, Blanchet collaborated with designer Edvin Thompson of Theophilio on a beaded bandeau top featured in look eight of his runway collection.
Photo: Sara KhalidBefore launching Jèblanc, Blanchet worked as a stylist in New York dressing both friends and private clients until she moved to Los Angeles to launch her brand.

     Summary: Ahead of the Schiaparelli Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2023 show in Paris, Doja Cat spent nearly five hours having 30,000 ruby red Swarovski crystals applied all over her body by hand.
“Such a pleasure working with the gorgeous Doja Cat and the amazing Daniel Roseberry on the ‘Doja’s Inferno’ look for Schiaparelli’s FW23 Haute Couture collection,” McGrath wrote on Instagram.
“Doja’s sublime patience during the 4 hours and 58 minutes it took to create the look with #TeamPatMcGrath, which was covered in over 30,000 hand-applied Swarovski Crystals, was inspiring.
Evocative of sublime sculptures; a true feast for the eyes.”When Doja Cat shaved her head last year, her eyebrows went, too.
“I have never felt more beautiful in my entire life, which is very strange,” the rapper told Dazed just after the transformation.

     Summary: She was also clad in a Schiaparelli ensemble that involved an opaque red bodice, a similarly crystal-studded skirt, a long red shawl and red knee-high boots.
“The Doja Cat look was fantastic,” Angharad Coates, an art and design PR executive based between Paris and NYC, told The Daily Beast.
“It’s right in line with Elsa Schiaparelli’s love of surrealism and artistic envelope-pushing, totally in line with the Maison’s history.
And as a Leo woman, I adored the lion look.
“Hair looks fucking terrible and the whole look just reeks of ‘daddy got me this lion plush at FAO Schwarz.’”Is Doja Cat’s look just the first of many wild fashion week looks to come?

Pat McGrath was behind the head-turning look, and Doja wore the artist’s Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick in Elson 4 — a vivid blue-red that blended seamlessly into her painted skin.
Today was the first day of the Haute Couture shows, so this might only be the beginning of a week full of epicness for Doja.
One thing’s for sure: She’s not afraid to push the limits and serve a full camp look that truly embodies the meaning of haute couture.
