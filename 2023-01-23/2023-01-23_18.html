    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bulls have won 10 of their last 16 games and are currently 10th in the Eastern Conference with a 21-24 record.
The question is, can the Bulls make a late-season push to reach the playoffs?
While Dosunmu and Williams have shown flashes of their potential, consistency has eluded both players.
Dosunmu, in particular, plays a crucial role in the grand scheme of things for the Bulls.
The Bulls need Williams to be consistent if they are going to make a playoff push.

Check out our NBA odds series for our Hawks-Bulls prediction and pick.
Why The Bulls Could Cover The SpreadZach LaVine looked sensational in front of the French NBA fans against Detroit.
Fatigue may be an issue in this one coming off a trip to Paris, so the Bulls will have to be sharp if they want to top the hot Hawks.
Final Hawks-Bulls Prediction &amp; PickThe Bulls have the better team of players, but have often found it difficult to replicate their strong performances game-to-game.

     Still some uncertainty with Bulls forward Javonte Green’s knee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “He hasn’t done any running or jumping,’’ coach Billy Donovan said when asked about a Bull’s injury status.
And, no, for the first time in almost a year, it wasn’t guard Lonzo Ball he was talking about.
He was referring to forward Javonte Green, who had minor exploratory surgery two weeks ago on his right knee and is still on the road back.
The length of that journey was still up in the air, especially after the latest update from Donovan.
He was in and out of games after that but never as a starter because of the knee problems and a minutes restriction.

     Summary: He made that clear Monday after reaching that 1,000-game milestone in helping the Bulls beat the Hawks 111-100 at the United Center.
Whenever the Bulls seemed to bury the Hawks (24-24) in the fourth quarter, Atlanta would bounce back.
DeRozan then nailed a three to stretch the lead back to 11, but the Hawks refused to quit.
A jumper by LaVine, then a three-pointer by Patrick Williams served as the daggers in the Bulls’ third consecutive victory.
“I think we’re getting [in a groove] as a team,’’ Williams said.
