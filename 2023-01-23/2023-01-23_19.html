     Chiefs' Andy Reid says Patrick Mahomes has 'done amazing things' on high-ankle sprain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes made it quite clear that his high-ankle sprain won’t keep him out of the AFC Championship this upcoming Sunday, and his head coach believes that to be the case as well.
Andy Reid spoke to reporters on Monday following a successful Saturday night where his Chiefs defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 27-20, to advance in the playoffs.
The win did come with a very scary moment when pass rusher Arden Key fell on Mahomes’ ankle, causing the sprain which Reid confirmed on Monday.
Since then, Reid said Mahomes is "doing OK" and has that same mindset of wanting to start for Kansas City next week against the Cincinnati Bengals.

     Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes has high ankle sprain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a high ankle sprain during Saturday's divisional-round victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, a league source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The nature of the injury to Mahomes' right ankle was confirmed Sunday by an MRI, which showed no other damage, a source told Schefter.
"Obviously, I have a lot of adrenaline going right now, so we'll see how it feels.
Chiefs coach Andy Reid noted after Saturday night's game that Mahomes has played through ankle injuries before.
Mahomes initially resisted the Chiefs' requests that he retreat to the locker room to have the ankle X-rayed, though he eventually relented.

     Chiefs QB Mahomes 'OK,' receiving treatment for high-ankle sprain -coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 23 (Reuters) - Quarterback Patrick Mahomes is receiving treatment for a high ankle sprain, Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid said on Monday, with the red-hot Cincinnati Bengals waiting for them in the AFC Championship.
Mahomes fell awkwardly after being tackled late in the first quarter of the Chiefs' 27-20 divisional round win over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Saturday.
A week later he completed 29 of 38 attempts to beat the Buffalo Bills 38-24 in the AFC Championship, helping the Chiefs to their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance.
"I'm just going to see how he's doing when we get to that Wednesday practice," he told reporters.
The Chiefs face a significant hurdle to reach their third Super Bowl in four years, with the Bengals coming out on top in their last three meetings.

pic.twitter.com/sg8Q50NvpD — FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) January 22, 2023 Provencher continued: “This is a typical injury pattern for a high ankle sprain, where the ankle is forced inward as the foot is rotated outward.
This is very common for a high ankle injury, and he was ruled as questionable to return.
History has plenty of examples of quarterbacks toughing out high ankle sprains, and some have even had success on the field.
Both Ben Roethlisberger and Tom Brady had poor outings in their first games back from high ankle sprains.

     What’s a high ankle sprain? What Mahomes’ recovery could look like
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: — For at least the next six days, it’s the most important limb in Kansas City, maybe the NFL.
Everybody’s talking about Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ right ankle.
He suffered a high ankle sprain during Saturday’s game against the Jaguars.
He said a high ankle sprain is when you injure the ligaments on the outside and top part of the ankle, and it takes a bit longer to get over that than a regular ankle sprain.
Zonno said step one for high ankle sprains is walking on it – without pain.
