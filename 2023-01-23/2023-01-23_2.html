     Lakers send Kendrick Nunn, second-round picks to Wizards for Rui Hachimura
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adrian Wojnarowski lays out how the Rui Hachimura trade to the Lakers came to be.
(2:01)The Los Angeles Lakers acquired Washington Wizards forward Rui Hachimura for Kendrick Nunn and three second-round picks, the team announced on Monday.
The deal includes a 2023 second-round pick via Chicago, the Lakers' own in 2029 and the less favorable of the Wizards' and Lakers' 2028 second-round picks, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
"I just want to be somewhere that wants me as a basketball player,'' Hachimura told reporters last week.
Nunn was signed to the taxpayer's mid-level exception in the summer of 2021 and missed his entire first season with the Lakers because of injuries.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers acquired former lottery pick Rui Hachimura from the Washington Wizards on Monday in exchange for Kendrick Nunn and a package of second-round draft picks.
Hachimura has appeared in 30 games for the Wizards this season, all off the bench, averaging 13.0 points on 49% shooting.
Hachimura equaled a career high with 30 points for the Wizards on Saturday in his final game before the deal.
Nunn has averaged 6.7 points in 39 games this season, 37 of them in a reserve role, with wildly inconsistent contributions offensively.
If he continues to improve, Davis could return during the Lakers' upcoming five-game road trip, which begins Saturday in Boston.

     Rui Hachimura traded to Lakers: How this move helps Los Angeles now and later
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In finalizing a trade for Rui Hachimura, the Los Angeles Lakers are making a long-awaited upgrade on the wing — both for this season and potentially the future.
After months of deliberation over finding the right player and deal, the Lakers opportunistically struck on Hachimura, the No.
According to those sources, Hachimura is expected to command a double-digit annual salary though much lower than his nearly $19 million cap hold.
That indicates he could shoot better in Los Angeles with James, Davis and Westbrook creating higher-percentage looks for him.
