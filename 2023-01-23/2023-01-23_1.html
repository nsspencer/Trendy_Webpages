     Josh Allen says his elbow needs rest and recovery, not surgery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesBills quarterback Josh Allen was on the injury report for most of the second half of the season because of a right elbow injury, but Allen indicated today that the injury won’t be an issue that affects his future.
Allen said that the elbow needs rest and recovery time, but that he and the team’s medical staff do not expect him to need surgery.
Although he had another strong season despite the injury, Allen did say that he felt that the elbow affected his throwing mechanics.
Mostly, however, Allen said he was sick to his stomach that the season came to an end yesterday against the Bengals.
He’s looking forward to healing that injured elbow and getting back to work for next season.

     Bills' Josh Allen Doesn't Believe Surgery is 'Necessary' for Elbow Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rich Graessle/Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesBuffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen believes he doesn't need surgery to repair the elbow injury that limited him for the second half of the season.
"We don't think an operation is necessary at this time," Allen told reporters.
Allen added that rest and recovery will help the injury, which will happen this offseason after the Bills were eliminated Sunday with a 27-10 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.
Given how much the Bills put on Allen's plate, it's remarkable he's been so durable throughout his NFL career.
The Bills will now hope he can get healthy over the offseason and make a deeper run in 2023.

     Summary: While quarterback Josh Allen was far from elite in this huge contest, his girlfriend of seven years, Brittany Williams, praised him early Monday on her Instagram story.
You can’t forget they also lost their best defender in Von Miller.
Allen finished the year with 4,283 yards, 35 touchdowns, and 14 picks for a 63.3% completion rate on his passes.
The reality is the Bills didn’t get it done when it mattered most.
Nonetheless, Allen’s woman is extremely proud of him and knows the best is still yet to come.

     Cam Newton-Josh Allen comparisons resurface following Bills' divisional round loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has seemingly always drawn comparisons to Carolina Panthers great Cam Newton, even before he played his first NFL snap.
Heck, Newton addressed the comparisons last season, before the two met in Week 15 of the 2021 campaign.
That talk resurfaced beginning on Sunday afternoon, when the Bills fell way short of a divisional round win against the Cincinnati Bengals.
And Allen didn’t do much to help the cause—throwing for zero touchdowns, one interception and his second-lowest passer rating of the season (68.1).
So, naturally, the fine folks of Twitter did their thing and got “Cam Newton” trending following Allen’s performance.

     Josh Allen Downplays Stefon Diggs Exchange on Bills Sideline: 'It's Not Fun Losing'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Sabitus/Getty ImagesThe broadcast of Sunday's AFC Divisional Round game captured Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs expressing frustration toward Josh Allen during the loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, and the quarterback addressed the topic Monday.
It appeared to work, as Diggs finished with four catches for just 35 yards in the 27-10 loss at Highmark Stadium.
Mahomes and Burrow will face each other in the AFC Championship Game for the second straight season.
The game will be in Kansas City, but so was last season's, when the Bengals emerged with a victory.
While Diggs was clearly frustrated during Sunday's loss, the combination of the quarterback and top wide receiver was one of the bright spots for the team this season.

     Josh Allen details season-ending loss, his elbow injury and what he'll remember about the 2022-23 Buffalo Bills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the Bills have reached the playoffs four straight seasons, and won their division three years in a row, they have been unable to break through the AFC barrier.
"We've got to play better in the later parts of the season," Allen said.
"We've got to find a way to peak at the right time in the playoffs."
Allen closed his nearly 20-minute press conference by acknowledging the amount of love and respect he has for everyone on this year's Bills team.
The 2022-23 Bills are just the 7th team in franchise history to win 12+ games in a single season and marked the third time in Bills history that they've won the division in three consecutive seasons.

McDermott previously has had chats with Diggs during games including one earlier this year against the Cleveland Browns.
In an even bigger sense, McDermott won’t like Diggs’ decision because now we’re all talking about him and the team in such a light.

As harsh as it might sound, this is what Josh Allen might be: A fantastic regular season quarterback who can’t get it done in the playoffs.
Now he has to go though the offseason knowing that he did not play like the Josh Allen that we all expect to see on these big gamedays in the 2022 NFL Playoffs.
