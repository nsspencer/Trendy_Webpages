     Lakers agree to deal for Wizards' Rui Hachimura
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers have agreed to a deal to acquire Washington Wizards forward Rui Hachimura for Kendrick Nunn and three second-round picks, sources told ESPN on Monday.
The deal includes a 2023 second-round pick via Chicago, the Lakers' own in 2029 and the less favorable of the Wizards' and Lakers' 2028 second-round picks, sources said.
"I just want to be somewhere that wants me as a basketball player,'' Hachimura told reporters last week.
The Lakers believe that Hachimura gives them another sizable wing defender who has shown an ability to make corner 3-pointers and midrange shots when teams run the Lakers off the 3-point line.
He was averaging 6.7 points off the bench for the Lakers this season.

     Wizards trade former lottery pick Rui Hachimura to Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers will send three future second-round picks and guard Kendrick Nunn to Washington for Hachimura.
The picks include a 2023 pick via Chicago, the Lakers’ own 2029 pick and whichever is the least favorable second rounder between the Wizards and Lakers in 2028.
Hachimura, a 2019 lottery pick, has struggled to fully blossom during his four seasons with the Wizards.
ESPN and The Athletic were first to report on the Hachimura trade.
The Wizards and Lakers are no strangers as trade partners, as they previously agreed to a 2021 trade that sent Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles.

     Summary: It looks like NBA trade season is starting in earnest.
According to ESPN's Adrian Wojanrowski, the Los Angeles Lakers have traded for Washington Wizards forward Rui Hachimura.
In return, the Lakers are reportedly sending back Kendrick Nunn and three second-round draft picks.
