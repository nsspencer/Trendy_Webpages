     'Forspoken' Review: A portal into a world without wonder or heart
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken pulls from genre staples and even begins with Alice in Wonderland references, but it also falls into troubling tropes.
Put simply, Square Enix faces too many open-world competitors to get away with a poor showing like this.
/ Square Enix / Square Enix Forspoken tries to present big-budget, beautiful environments, but doesn't quite compete with rival open-world titles.
Admittedly, the combat does get more interesting as you defeat bosses and gain their abilities, but it feels dated even in comparison to its inspiration — 2016's Final Fantasy XV.
Put simply, Square Enix faces too many open-world competitors to get away with a poor showing like this.

     ‘Forspoken’ PS5 Reviews Are Here, And They Are Bad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken MetacriticAs I said previously, red flags have been going up about Square Enix’s Forspoken left and right as of late.
Reviews are spilling in for Forspoken and they are pretty bad.
In the context of other video game releases, these are bad scores, bad aggregates.
Square Enix pulled the old “limited digital codes” trick and specifically avoided giving codes to many outlets.
This is bad for both Square Enix, and for PlayStation, who touted this as one of its major console exclusives this year.

     Forspoken is better than its bad name implies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You’re not going to believe me when I tell you this, but Forspoken is pretty good.
I became invested in Frey and her story, and I was curious as to how Forspoken would lay it all out.
I’m playing on a PS5, the most technically advanced console someone can own right now, and Forspoken felt like it was held together by wet tissue paper.
Fighting in Forspoken happens in two phases:Find which of the four elements Frey can control is powerful against your opponent.
Now listen, I know that taking this review altogether, Forspoken doesn’t seem like the best investment.

     ‘Forspoken’ Shines in Its Combat and Traversal: Video Game Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Forspoken” feels fluid to play and has gorgeous visuals to support its open-world structure.
When Frey steps into Athia, she meets Cuff, a magical bracelet that imbues her with elemental powers to defend herself.
Frey’s east coast origins also provide a really interesting contrast between her and the aristocratic locals in the city of Cipal, Athia’s final stronghold.
The combat is one of the most fun parts of “Forspoken.” The real-time system from “Final Fantasy XV” puts a bigger emphasis on magic here.
The dialogue between her and Cuff is witty and memorable, and there’s incredible attention to detail in Athia’s world and history through the game’s many collectibles.

     Forspoken review: Surprises and delights, but they take a while
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ArrowRight Developer: Luminous Productions | Publisher: Square Enix Release date: Jan. 24, 2023 I didn’t expect to enjoy “Forspoken” as much as I did.
This type of speak was also common for Nathan Drake, the protagonist of the “Uncharted” series, which shares the same writer as “Forspoken” Amy Hennig.
But a lot of things happen later in the game that make “Forspoken” just a little more special.
But at least the bigger spells land with some force.
I consider myself a pretty cynical viewer when it comes to being surprised by video game stories, yet “Forspoken” still caught me off guard.

     Forspoken review: magical action overcomes weak storytelling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken is magical when focusing on its strengths, but it’ll take some crawling to get through a slow opening.
Narrative disconnectForspoken follows Alfrey Holland, who goes by Frey, a troubled 21-year-old orphan whisked away to a magical world called Athia (Alice in Wonderland-style) on Christmas Day.
Fun stretches of action are distributed between lengthy narrative-focused spurts, leaving a disconnect between the two.
Sadly, I usually wanted to jump through the rabbit hole to return to the fun, open-world gameplay in those moments.
Forspoken does know how to do open-world game design right: there’s always somewhere interesting to go, it’s fun to get there, and you’ll always be rewarded for engaging.
