     Josh Allen says his elbow needs rest and recovery, not surgery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesBills quarterback Josh Allen was on the injury report for most of the second half of the season because of a right elbow injury, but Allen indicated today that the injury won’t be an issue that affects his future.
Allen said that the elbow needs rest and recovery time, but that he and the team’s medical staff do not expect him to need surgery.
Although he had another strong season despite the injury, Allen did say that he felt that the elbow affected his throwing mechanics.
Mostly, however, Allen said he was sick to his stomach that the season came to an end yesterday against the Bengals.
He’s looking forward to healing that injured elbow and getting back to work for next season.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While quarterback Josh Allen was far from elite in this huge contest, his girlfriend of seven years, Brittany Williams, praised him early Monday on her Instagram story.
You can’t forget they also lost their best defender in Von Miller.
Allen finished the year with 4,283 yards, 35 touchdowns, and 14 picks for a 63.3% completion rate on his passes.
The reality is the Bills didn’t get it done when it mattered most.
Nonetheless, Allen’s woman is extremely proud of him and knows the best is still yet to come.

     Josh Allen Downplays Stefon Diggs Exchange on Bills Sideline: 'It's Not Fun Losing'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Sabitus/Getty ImagesThe broadcast of Sunday's AFC Divisional Round game captured Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs expressing frustration toward Josh Allen during the loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, and the quarterback addressed the topic Monday.
It appeared to work, as Diggs finished with four catches for just 35 yards in the 27-10 loss at Highmark Stadium.
Mahomes and Burrow will face each other in the AFC Championship Game for the second straight season.
The game will be in Kansas City, but so was last season's, when the Bengals emerged with a victory.
While Diggs was clearly frustrated during Sunday's loss, the combination of the quarterback and top wide receiver was one of the bright spots for the team this season.

     Bills' Allen seeks 'rest and recovery' as he gauges elbow injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Allen said that there are no plans for any offseason procedures or surgeries on the elbow and that "rest and recovery is gonna be really good for it."
The Bills became the first preseason title favorite not to reach a conference championship game since the Seattle Seahawks in 2015.
He did not miss a single game because of the injury but was listed on the injury report with it through the end of the season.
Two of the Bills' three regular-season losses came before Allen's injury, including the one to the Jets.
During Weeks 1-9, Allen completed 64.1% of his passes for 2,403 passing yards, throwing for 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions.

     Summary: While the Bills have reached the playoffs four straight seasons, and won their division three years in a row, they have been unable to break through the AFC barrier.
"We've got to play better in the later parts of the season," Allen said.
"We've got to find a way to peak at the right time in the playoffs."
Allen closed his nearly 20-minute press conference by acknowledging the amount of love and respect he has for everyone on this year's Bills team.
The 2022-23 Bills are just the 7th team in franchise history to win 12+ games in a single season and marked the third time in Bills history that they've won the division in three consecutive seasons.
