     Josh Allen says his elbow needs rest and recovery, not surgery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesBills quarterback Josh Allen was on the injury report for most of the second half of the season because of a right elbow injury, but Allen indicated today that the injury won’t be an issue that affects his future.
Allen said that the elbow needs rest and recovery time, but that he and the team’s medical staff do not expect him to need surgery.
Although he had another strong season despite the injury, Allen did say that he felt that the elbow affected his throwing mechanics.
Mostly, however, Allen said he was sick to his stomach that the season came to an end yesterday against the Bengals.
He’s looking forward to healing that injured elbow and getting back to work for next season.

     Bills' Josh Allen Doesn't Believe Surgery is 'Necessary' for Elbow Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rich Graessle/Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesBuffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen believes he doesn't need surgery to repair the elbow injury that limited him for the second half of the season.
"We don't think an operation is necessary at this time," Allen told reporters.
Allen added that rest and recovery will help the injury, which will happen this offseason after the Bills were eliminated Sunday with a 27-10 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.
Given how much the Bills put on Allen's plate, it's remarkable he's been so durable throughout his NFL career.
The Bills will now hope he can get healthy over the offseason and make a deeper run in 2023.

     Josh Allen Downplays Stefon Diggs Exchange on Bills Sideline: 'It's Not Fun Losing'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Sabitus/Getty ImagesThe broadcast of Sunday's AFC Divisional Round game captured Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs expressing frustration toward Josh Allen during the loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, and the quarterback addressed the topic Monday.
It appeared to work, as Diggs finished with four catches for just 35 yards in the 27-10 loss at Highmark Stadium.
Mahomes and Burrow will face each other in the AFC Championship Game for the second straight season.
The game will be in Kansas City, but so was last season's, when the Bengals emerged with a victory.
While Diggs was clearly frustrated during Sunday's loss, the combination of the quarterback and top wide receiver was one of the bright spots for the team this season.

     Bills QB Josh Allen does not believe he'll need surgery on right elbow, just 'rest and recovery'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Obviously rest and recovery is going to be really good for it," Allen said, via the team's official site.
Bills head coach Sean McDermott echoed Allen on Monday, telling reporters the quarterback's elbow needed more attention initially but eventually it wasn't a concern.
After producing at a premier level in pass-rushing, Buffalo's defensive front failed to pressure Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow enough to make a difference in Sunday's game.
The Bills generated a QB pressure percentage of just 21.6, per Next Gen Stats, which paled in comparison to Cincinnati's rate of 39.5 percent when rushing Allen.
"We've got to look at that," McDermott said of the play of his team's offensive and defensive lines.

     Cam Newton-Josh Allen comparisons resurface following Bills' divisional round loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has seemingly always drawn comparisons to Carolina Panthers great Cam Newton, even before he played his first NFL snap.
Heck, Newton addressed the comparisons last season, before the two met in Week 15 of the 2021 campaign.
That talk resurfaced beginning on Sunday afternoon, when the Bills fell way short of a divisional round win against the Cincinnati Bengals.
And Allen didn’t do much to help the cause—throwing for zero touchdowns, one interception and his second-lowest passer rating of the season (68.1).
So, naturally, the fine folks of Twitter did their thing and got “Cam Newton” trending following Allen’s performance.

     Josh Allen details season-ending loss, his elbow injury and what he'll remember about the 2022-23 Buffalo Bills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the Bills have reached the playoffs four straight seasons, and won their division three years in a row, they have been unable to break through the AFC barrier.
"We've got to play better in the later parts of the season," Allen said.
"We've got to find a way to peak at the right time in the playoffs."
Allen closed his nearly 20-minute press conference by acknowledging the amount of love and respect he has for everyone on this year's Bills team.
The 2022-23 Bills are just the 7th team in franchise history to win 12+ games in a single season and marked the third time in Bills history that they've won the division in three consecutive seasons.

     How Bengals DC Lou Anarumo confused Josh Allen and the Bills in convincing divisional round playoff win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bengals certainly out-executed the Bills in their convincing 27-10 win in the divisional round, but the game plans on offense and especially on defense were masterclasses by Zac Taylor and Lou Anarumo.
Behind an offensive line down three starters, Burrow threw exactly half of his passes (19) in 2.5 seconds or less against the Bills.
It was the creativity of the blitz and often the appearance of the blitz that confounded Buffalo's ultra-talented quarterback and Bills offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey all afternoon.
And then late, as the Bills were making their last gasp at a comeback, Anarumo dialed up an amazing corner blitz Allen and his offensive line never saw coming.
Nothing is guaranteed in the NFL, but the Bengals have the quarterback, the offensive and defensive talent, and the game-plan mastery to win a Super Bowl.

McDermott previously has had chats with Diggs during games including one earlier this year against the Cleveland Browns.
In an even bigger sense, McDermott won’t like Diggs’ decision because now we’re all talking about him and the team in such a light.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Allen said that there are no plans for any offseason procedures or surgeries on the elbow and that "rest and recovery is gonna be really good for it."
The Bills became the first preseason title favorite not to reach a conference championship game since the Seattle Seahawks in 2015.
He did not miss a single game because of the injury but was listed on the injury report with it through the end of the season.
Two of the Bills' three regular-season losses came before Allen's injury, including the one to the Jets.
During Weeks 1-9, Allen completed 64.1% of his passes for 2,403 passing yards, throwing for 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions.
