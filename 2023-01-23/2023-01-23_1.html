     Lakers agree to deal for Wizards' Rui Hachimura
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adrian Wojnarowski lays out how the Rui Hachimura trade to the Lakers came to be.
(2:01)The Los Angeles Lakers have agreed to a deal to acquire Washington Wizards forward Rui Hachimura for Kendrick Nunn and three second-round picks, sources told ESPN on Monday.
The deal includes a 2023 second-round pick via Chicago, the Lakers' own in 2029 and the less favorable of the Wizards' and Lakers' 2028 second-round picks, sources said.
"I just want to be somewhere that wants me as a basketball player,'' Hachimura told reporters last week.
He was averaging 6.7 points off the bench for the Lakers this season.

     NBA Trade Grades: Lakers Nab Rui Hachimura From the Wizards
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles acquired forward Rui Hachimura from the Wizards on Monday, per multiple reports.
The Lakers will send Washington guard Kendrick Nunn and three second-round picks in the deal.
Hachimura, a former ninth overall pick, is in his fourth season in the NBA.
The Lakers will get some much needed help from forward Rui Hachimura.
This grade more so reflects not being able to get it done with Hachimura than this trade itself, which for the Wizards is nothing more or less than a definitive “Meh.”

     Wizards trade former lottery pick Rui Hachimura to Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers will send three future second-round picks and guard Kendrick Nunn to Washington for Hachimura.
The picks include a 2023 pick via Chicago, the Lakers’ own 2029 pick and whichever is the least favorable second rounder between the Wizards and Lakers in 2028.
Hachimura, a 2019 lottery pick, has struggled to fully blossom during his four seasons with the Wizards.
ESPN and The Athletic were first to report on the Hachimura trade.
The Wizards and Lakers are no strangers as trade partners, as they previously agreed to a 2021 trade that sent Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles.

     AP source: Lakers acquiring Rui Hachimura from Wizards
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers are acquiring former lottery pick Rui Hachimura from the Washington Wizards in exchange for Kendrick Nunn and a package of second-round draft picks, a person familiar with the negotiations said Monday.
Hachimura and the Wizards did not agree on a rookie extension before the season started, which prompted speculation that the Japanese power forward wouldn’t be in their long-term plans.
Hachimura has appeared in 30 games for the Wizards this season, all off the bench, averaging 13.0 points on 49% shooting from the floor.
The Lakers have given no definite timeline for Davis' return, but coach Darvin Ham said Davis “looked great” in a full scrimmage last weekend.
If he continues to improve, Davis could return during the Lakers' upcoming five-game road trip, which begins Saturday in Boston.

     Lakers reportedly trade for Rui Hachimura, send Kendrick Nunn, 3 second-round picks to Wizards
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It looks like NBA trade season is starting in earnest.
According to ESPN's Adrian Wojanrowski, the Los Angeles Lakers have traded for Washington Wizards forward Rui Hachimura.
In return, the Lakers are reportedly sending back Kendrick Nunn and three second-round draft picks.
The Wizards reportedly began exploring trade options for Hachimura a little over a week ago, but the writing may have been on the wall from the start of the season.
When asked about the possibility of being traded last weekend, Hachimura seemed pretty sanguine about the whole thing.
