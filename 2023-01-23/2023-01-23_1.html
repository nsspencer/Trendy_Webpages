     Review: 'Forspoken's fantastic gameplay gets buried under a weak story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Square EnixWhile Forspoken’s story disappoints, its gameplay systems are engaging and rewarding, with progression that encourages thorough exploration.
Combat is only heightened by Forspoken’s gorgeous graphics, with dazzling particle effects that make each and every battle feel like a spectacle.
As you unlock additional magic, you’ll also access new parkour abilities, like gliding over water, leaping up cliffsides, and a grappling move.
With strong progression and fluid traversal, Forspoken’s world is a joy to explore, even if the narrative doesn’t back it up.

     Forspoken is better than its bad name implies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You’re not going to believe me when I tell you this, but Forspoken is pretty good.
I became invested in Frey and her story, and I was curious as to how Forspoken would lay it all out.
I’m playing on a PS5, the most technically advanced console someone can own right now, and Forspoken felt like it was held together by wet tissue paper.
Fighting in Forspoken happens in two phases:Find which of the four elements Frey can control is powerful against your opponent.
Now listen, I know that taking this review altogether, Forspoken doesn’t seem like the best investment.

     'Forspoken' Review: A portal into a world without wonder or heart
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken pulls from genre staples and even begins with Alice in Wonderland references, but it also falls into troubling tropes.
Put simply, Square Enix faces too many open-world competitors to get away with a poor showing like this.
/ Square Enix / Square Enix Forspoken tries to present big-budget, beautiful environments, but doesn't quite compete with rival open-world titles.
Admittedly, the combat does get more interesting as you defeat bosses and gain their abilities, but it feels dated even in comparison to its inspiration — 2016's Final Fantasy XV.

     Forspoken review: Surprises and delights, but they take a while
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ArrowRight Developer: Luminous Productions | Publisher: Square Enix Release date: Jan. 24, 2023 I didn’t expect to enjoy “Forspoken” as much as I did.
This type of speak was also common for Nathan Drake, the protagonist of the “Uncharted” series, which shares the same writer as “Forspoken” Amy Hennig.
But a lot of things happen later in the game that make “Forspoken” just a little more special.
But at least the bigger spells land with some force.
I consider myself a pretty cynical viewer when it comes to being surprised by video game stories, yet “Forspoken” still caught me off guard.

     Forspoken review: magical action overcomes weak storytelling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forspoken is magical when focusing on its strengths, but it’ll take some crawling to get through a slow opening.
Narrative disconnectForspoken follows Alfrey Holland, who goes by Frey, a troubled 21-year-old orphan whisked away to a magical world called Athia (Alice in Wonderland-style) on Christmas Day.
Fun stretches of action are distributed between lengthy narrative-focused spurts, leaving a disconnect between the two.
Sadly, I usually wanted to jump through the rabbit hole to return to the fun, open-world gameplay in those moments.
Forspoken does know how to do open-world game design right: there’s always somewhere interesting to go, it’s fun to get there, and you’ll always be rewarded for engaging.

     Forspoken: A Formulaic, Albeit Thoughtful Take On the Open-World Genre
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Final Fantasy maker Square Enix and Final Fantasy XV team Luminous Productions set themselves a monstrous task with Forspoken.
Forspoken opens with Frey on trial for petty theft.
The laws of nature are seemingly turned upside down, and the Tantas, Athia’s four warrior rulers, now oppress their people and govern as violent dictators.
What kept me interested in both the main story and beyond was Forspoken’s detailed world building and thoughtful approach to design.
The game draws inspiration from the likes of Horizon Zero Dawn and similar open-world epics, but there’s an important distinction.
