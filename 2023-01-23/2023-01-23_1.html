     Josh Allen says his elbow needs rest and recovery, not surgery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesBills quarterback Josh Allen was on the injury report for most of the second half of the season because of a right elbow injury, but Allen indicated today that the injury won’t be an issue that affects his future.
Allen said that the elbow needs rest and recovery time, but that he and the team’s medical staff do not expect him to need surgery.
Although he had another strong season despite the injury, Allen did say that he felt that the elbow affected his throwing mechanics.
Mostly, however, Allen said he was sick to his stomach that the season came to an end yesterday against the Bengals.
He’s looking forward to healing that injured elbow and getting back to work for next season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nick WojtonBills WireWith the weight of an entire city and fan base on his shoulders, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen tried to muster together the right words for how he felt after his season came to an end.
In what seemed like a slow burn, the Cincinnati Bengals beat the Bills by a 27-10 final in the AFC divisional round.
For Allen, that lone loss wiped away everything else he and the Bills accomplished in 2022.
Our goal was to win a Super Bowl, a world championship, and we didn’t accomplish that,” Allen said in his post-game press conference.
"So, everything that happened this season is kind of null and void in our minds.

     Josh Allen Downplays Stefon Diggs Exchange on Bills Sideline: 'It's Not Fun Losing'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Sabitus/Getty ImagesThe broadcast of Sunday's AFC Divisional Round game captured Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs expressing frustration toward Josh Allen during the loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, and the quarterback addressed the topic Monday.
It appeared to work, as Diggs finished with four catches for just 35 yards in the 27-10 loss at Highmark Stadium.
Mahomes and Burrow will face each other in the AFC Championship Game for the second straight season.
The game will be in Kansas City, but so was last season's, when the Bengals emerged with a victory.
While Diggs was clearly frustrated during Sunday's loss, the combination of the quarterback and top wide receiver was one of the bright spots for the team this season.

     Bills QB Josh Allen does not believe he'll need surgery on right elbow, just 'rest and recovery'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Obviously rest and recovery is going to be really good for it," Allen said, via the team's official site.
Bills head coach Sean McDermott echoed Allen on Monday, telling reporters the quarterback's elbow needed more attention initially but eventually it wasn't a concern.
After producing at a premier level in pass-rushing, Buffalo's defensive front failed to pressure Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow enough to make a difference in Sunday's game.
The Bills generated a QB pressure percentage of just 21.6, per Next Gen Stats, which paled in comparison to Cincinnati's rate of 39.5 percent when rushing Allen.
"We've got to look at that," McDermott said of the play of his team's offensive and defensive lines.

     Summary: The Bengals are a win away from the Super Bowl, and that means Cincinnati cornerback Eli Apple is a win away from another Super Bowl media cycle.
And if the Bengals can beat the Chiefs on Sunday to advance, Apple will be well-prepared.
It started when Buffalo wide receiver Stefon Diggs tweeted his frustrations with his team's abrupt exit, writing, "It's easy to criticize my reaction more than the result."
Apple gleefully quote-tweeted Diggs with "Cancun on 3," implying the Bills would now embark on offseason vacations.
Then, quote-tweeting a video of Diggs arguing with quarterback Josh Allen, Apple wrote, "Someone get them in couples therapy ...

     Cam Newton-Josh Allen comparisons resurface following Bills' divisional round loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has seemingly always drawn comparisons to Carolina Panthers great Cam Newton, even before he played his first NFL snap.
Heck, Newton addressed the comparisons last season, before the two met in Week 15 of the 2021 campaign.
That talk resurfaced beginning on Sunday afternoon, when the Bills fell way short of a divisional round win against the Cincinnati Bengals.
And Allen didn’t do much to help the cause—throwing for zero touchdowns, one interception and his second-lowest passer rating of the season (68.1).
So, naturally, the fine folks of Twitter did their thing and got “Cam Newton” trending following Allen’s performance.

     Josh Allen details season-ending loss, his elbow injury and what he'll remember about the 2022-23 Buffalo Bills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the Bills have reached the playoffs four straight seasons, and won their division three years in a row, they have been unable to break through the AFC barrier.
"We've got to play better in the later parts of the season," Allen said.
"We've got to find a way to peak at the right time in the playoffs."
Allen closed his nearly 20-minute press conference by acknowledging the amount of love and respect he has for everyone on this year's Bills team.
The 2022-23 Bills are just the 7th team in franchise history to win 12+ games in a single season and marked the third time in Bills history that they've won the division in three consecutive seasons.

“You want to win them all, that’s the way it goes sometimes.”McDermott backed Allen’s assessment of Diggs.
McDermott previously has had chats with Diggs during games including one earlier this year against the Cleveland Browns.
In an even bigger sense, McDermott won’t like Diggs’ decision because now we’re all talking about him and the team in such a light.

You can’t forget they also lost their best defender in Von Miller.
Allen finished the year with 4,283 yards, 35 touchdowns, and 14 picks for a 63.3% completion rate on his passes.
The reality is the Bills didn’t get it done when it mattered most.
Nonetheless, Allen’s woman is extremely proud of him and knows the best is still yet to come.

     Summary: Allen said that there are no plans for any offseason procedures or surgeries on the elbow and that "rest and recovery is gonna be really good for it."
The Bills became the first preseason title favorite not to reach a conference championship game since the Seattle Seahawks in 2015.
He did not miss a single game because of the injury but was listed on the injury report with it through the end of the season.
Two of the Bills' three regular-season losses came before Allen's injury, including the one to the Jets.
During Weeks 1-9, Allen completed 64.1% of his passes for 2,403 passing yards, throwing for 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions.
