    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adrian Wojnarowski lays out how the Rui Hachimura trade to the Lakers came to be.
(2:01)The Los Angeles Lakers acquired Washington Wizards forward Rui Hachimura for Kendrick Nunn and three second-round picks, the team announced on Monday.
The deal includes a 2023 second-round pick via Chicago, the Lakers' own in 2029 and the less favorable of the Wizards' and Lakers' 2028 second-round picks, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
"I just want to be somewhere that wants me as a basketball player,'' Hachimura told reporters last week.
He was averaging 6.7 points off the bench for the Lakers this season.

     Report: Lakers acquire Wizards’ Rui Hachimura for Kendrick Nunn, three picks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first domino of NBA trade season has fallen in Los Angeles.
The Lakers are acquiring forward Rui Hachimura from the Washington Wizards, according to The Athletic’s Shams Charania.
In exchange, Los Angeles reportedly will send guard Kendrick Nunn and three second-round draft picks to Washington.
Sources: Lakers are sending the 2023 Chicago second-rounder, their own 2029 second-rounder and the Wizards/Lakers less favorable second-rounder in 2028 in the Kendrick Nunn-for-Rui Hachimura trade.
On the Lakers’ side, much has been made about their 2027 and 2029 first-round picks and whether the team would use them to bring in reinforcements alongside LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
