     M&amp;M’s replaces cartoon ‘spokescandies’ with Maya Rudolph after ‘woke’ backlash from Fox News
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After its mascot refresh controversy last year, M&amp;M's announced Monday that it is taking an "indefinite pause" from using its candy-coated mascots, saying the "last thing M&amp;M’s wanted" was to be "polarizing."
Rudolph told TODAY.com that she is “thrilled” to represent the brand in a Super Bowl ad on Feb. 12.
An M&amp;M’s spokesperson confirmed Rudolph's first appearance as its spokesperson will be during the Super Bowl.
Rudolph's new role will "allow the colorful cast of M&amp;M’S spokescandies to step away and embrace a new path to pursue other passions," the M&amp;M’s spokesperson said.
He made similar complaints about the candies last January after M&amp;M’s announced a new, inclusive look.

     M&amp;M’s Ditches Spokescandies After Backlash, Here’s Why It Matters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The controversy started last January when the green M&amp;M spokescandy exchanged her white go-go boots for white sneakers.
Rumors suggest that Green’s sexy boots and personality could be traced back to a myth that green M&amp;M’s were an aphrodisiac.
In 2012, M&amp;M’s added Brown, another female who had reportedly worked for decades behind the scenes as 'chief chocolate officer.'"
The new packaging featured the three female M&amp;M’s, Green, Brown and Purple.
In the case of M&amp;M’s, they seem to be sending the message that female empowerment and inclusivity aren’t worth that risk.

     M&amp;Ms Spokescandies Controversy: Everything You Need to Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It goes on to note that the colorful little candy mascots seen in the company's ads -- essentially, M&amp;Ms with faces and limbs -- have caused internet controversy.
The green M&amp;M is portrayed as the sexy one, seemingly playing off an old playground joke about green M&amp;Ms being little aphrodisiacs.
Maya Rudolph will almost certainly appear in an M&amp;Ms Super Bowl ad, but there's no way she's replacing the little animated critters for good.
According to TMZ, Rudolph has confirmed that the fuss is just leading up to her Super Bowl ad.
Tune in to the Super Bowl on Feb. 12 to see what kind of ad M&amp;Ms has cooked up with Maya Rudolph.

     M&amp;M’s ‘spokescandies’ controversy, explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mars Wrigley, the maker of the colorful chocolate candies, has pulled its M&amp;M’s ‘spokescandies’ mascots “indefinitely” from its marketing and branding.
The statement, tweeted from M&amp;M’s official account, reads:In the last year, we’ve made some changes to our beloved spokescandies.
Why are the M&amp;M’S ‘spokescandies’ leaving?
Most notably, the company made green M&amp;M less “sexy” by shortening her legs and replacing her high-heeled boots with sneakers.
However, Mars Wrigley did tease that the brand would be making an appearance in the upcoming Super Bowl.

     M&amp;M’S says it’s taking a ‘pause’ from polarizing spokescandies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “In the last year, we’ve made some changes to our beloved spokescandies,” the chocolate candy brand said in a statement Monday.
The Green M&amp;M, pre-makeover, is seen here in her go-go boots.
“There are lots of stories out there but let me say conclusively that this decision isn’t a reaction to but rather is in support of our M&amp;M’S brand,” Wesley said.
A petition to “keep the green M&amp;M sexy” garnered over 20,000 signatures.
Purple was recently deployed as part of a limited-edition pack of purple, brown and green M&amp;M’S — the colors of the female spokescandies — in honor of International Women’s Day.
