     Oscar Futures: Our Final Predictions for the Nominees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo-Illustration: VultureWhy do this year’s Oscar nominations feel so much harder to predict than usual?
That this year’s awards crop is stacked with box-office smashes like Top Gun: Maverick and Avatar: The Way of Water has bolstered hopes we’ll see the most mainstream set of Oscar nominations in years.
McDonagh bore that unfortunate honor in his Three Billboards year, but having returned with another Best Picture contender, I think voters will respect his fortitude.
In the final spot, I would love to see a personal effort like Aftersun or a tasty surprise like The Menu.
Another Best Picture hopeful the Brits snubbed, Glass Onion, is probably safe as well.
