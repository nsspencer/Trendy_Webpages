Credit:FairfaxBut the online world is very different from writing a book.
But that’s not my focus, my focus is helping survivors know there is hope.
My focus is to also take a strong stand against online abuse and set an example for the next generation of young boys and girls, who are stepping into a world where online bullying is sadly such a big part of their lives to navigate.
I’d like to encourage and educate them on what’s not OK, and how to deal with it.

     Former tennis star Jelena Dokic slams trolls over offensive posts about her body
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Hilary Whiteman, CNNFormer Australian tennis star Jelena Dokic has hit back at online trolls she says have bombarded her with negative comments about her body at the Australian Open.
But Dokic’s on-court success came at a tremendous cost, as she revealed in her autobiography, “Unbreakable,” first published in 2018.
In the book, Dokic details the physical, verbal, and mental abuse she says she suffered at the hands of her father and former coach, Damar Dokic.
Dokic cut ties with her father in 2002, leaving “in the middle of the night” with just her racquet bag and a suitcase, she said.
The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.
