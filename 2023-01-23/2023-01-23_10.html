     Summary: While the Chicago Bulls sure looked happy to be home, they also looked a wee bit jet-lagged.
It was largely this ability to turn these turnovers into points that helped Chicago turn 17 first-quarter points into 40 second-quarter points.
Indeed, scoring points off turnovers ended up being the story of the night.
The Bulls started the 4th quarter on an 11-3 run and ended up winning the final frame 33-22.
Williams ended the game with 18 points and 10 rebounds, which marked his first double-double of the season.

     Summary: The Chicago Bulls have won 10 of their last 16 games and are currently 10th in the Eastern Conference with a 21-24 record.
The question is, can the Bulls make a late-season push to reach the playoffs?
While Dosunmu and Williams have shown flashes of their potential, consistency has eluded both players.
Dosunmu, in particular, plays a crucial role in the grand scheme of things for the Bulls.
The Bulls need Williams to be consistent if they are going to make a playoff push.

     Summary: “He hasn’t done any running or jumping,’’ coach Billy Donovan said when asked about a Bull’s injury status.
And, no, for the first time in almost a year, it wasn’t guard Lonzo Ball he was talking about.
He was referring to forward Javonte Green, who had minor exploratory surgery two weeks ago on his right knee and is still on the road back.
The length of that journey was still up in the air, especially after the latest update from Donovan.
He was in and out of games after that but never as a starter because of the knee problems and a minutes restriction.
