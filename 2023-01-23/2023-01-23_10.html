     Jonathan Isaac Will Make His NBA Return in Orlando Magic’s Home Game Against Boston Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORLANDO – It’s been 904 days, a period of time spanning across four different seasons, since Jonathan Isaac played in NBA action.
Isaac is expected to return to the floor from a devastating left knee injury when the Orlando Magic host the Boston Celtics tonight at 7 p.m.
After missing the last two-and-a-half seasons, Isaac recently took a major step in his rehab process by playing with Orlando’s G League affiliate, the Lakeland Magic.
IN AND OUT: Orlando will be without Kevon Harris (G League – Two-Way), Caleb Houstan (G League – On Assignment) and Chuma Okeke (left knee surgery) on Monday night.
For Boston, Robert Williams III (left knee injury management) is questionable, while Malcolm Brogdon (personal reasons), Danilo Gallinari (left knee; ACL repair) and Marcus Smart (right ankle sprain) are out.
