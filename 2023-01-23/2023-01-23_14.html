More infoLionel Messi has reportedly changed his mind about his future and will not pen a new deal at Paris Saint-Germain .
Rather unsurprisingly, Messi has been one of the standout stars in the Ligue 1 so far this season.
Upon his return to the club, it was reported that the former Barcelona star had agreed on a new deal with the French side.
However, he has had a change of mind and is now exploring other options, according to Gerard Romero.

     Conflicting reports arise on whether Lionel Messi will renew with PSG
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A report from Barcelona and a report from France contradict each other on the question of whether Lionel Messi will renew his contract with Paris Saint-Germain.
Up until now it had been said that Messi was likely to stay at PSG when his contract ran out this season.
“Leo Messi’s renewal with PSG is not so certain, and it doesn’t seem he will renew,” Romero said.
Gerard Romero says Messi's plan as of today is to NOT renew with PSG.
If Messi did not continue at PSG, FC Barcelona would be one of the most logical spots.

     Could Newcastle United finally bring Lionel Messi to the Premier League?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How Lionel Messi could finally play in the Premier League soon…According to reports in the BBC, Argentinian star Lionel Messi has reached an ‘agreement in principle’ to remain at French club Paris-Saint-Germain beyond his contract expiry in June 2023.
However, a move to the English Premier League would now surely crown his career.
The 4-time UEFA Champions League winner with Barcelona has returned to defending Ligue 1 champions PSG with little left to prove to the footballing world.
Lionel Messi bagged the opener in last week’s 5-4 win for PSG over a Saudi All-Star XI in the Riyadh Season Cup.
Lionel Messi famously stated in 2010 that he would never play in the Premier League, but at the same time said that he would never leave Barcelona.

     Summary: Lionel Messi reportedly wants to leave Paris Saint Germain.
PSG via Getty ImagesLionel Messi has no intention of renewing his expiring contract with Paris Saint Germain, according to reports.
While it was previously reported before the World Cup that Messi intended to extend terms at Paris Saint Germain, there have been rumors in recent weeks that nothing is certain.
Almost a fortnight ago, Mundo Deportivo broke the news that Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal were reporedly ready to offer Messi a mouthwatering deal of up to $350 million a year.
Ronaldo was third on the list with $100 million ($40 million on-field, $60 million off-field), and Messi's PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe clinched first place thanks to his lucrative contract extension with the club which brought him $128 million split into $110 million on-field and $18 millon off-field.

     Saudi football chief reveals Lionel Messi transfer desire to join Cristiano Ronaldo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ronaldo, 37, joined Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr after leaving Manchester United on a free transfer and is set to make a staggering £177m per year during his time with the club.
It was reported recently that Messi was offered an incredible £246million-a-year deal to sign for Al-Hilal, a contract that would dwarf Ronaldo’s at Al-Nassr.
Ibrahim Alkassim - the General Secretary of the Saudi Football Federation - told Marca that he is unaware of a plan to lure the global superstar to the Middle East at the moment but left the door open for a move in the future.
He said: “At the moment we do not know anything about a possible Lionel Messi arrival.
“Although I do not hide that, as Saudi Federation, we would like to have him one day in the domestic league.

     Doubts over Messi staying with PSG grow as MLS move rears its head again
    </h2>

     Summary: After the 2022 World Cup, everything pointed to Lionel Messi renewing his deal with French side PSG and any ideas that he was destined to head to MLS in the near future slipped away.
Things may have shifted and according to Barcelona based journalist Gerard Romero, Messi is no longer convinced of wanting to extend his relationship with PSG, and this opens the door for a possible move to MLS either in the forthcoming summer market or for the 2024 campaign.
Messi ends his contract with the French club in June of this year, and according to Romero, Messi is closer to being a free agent than to extending his stay with the Ligue 1 outfit.
