     Summary: Three minutes into the second half of the Duke basketball team's road battle against the Virginia Tech Hokies on Monday night, Blue Devil freshman Dariq Whitehead landed awkwardly while pursuing a loose ball, seemingly injuring his left ankle.
Just before the under-12 timeout, the ESPN broadcast reported that Whitehead had a lower leg injury and was doubtful to return.
Whitehead, a projected one-and-one but averaging only 8.3 points per game entering the contest, was on pace for an impressive point total against the Hokies.
Dariq Whitehead has already missed four Duke basketball games this season.
