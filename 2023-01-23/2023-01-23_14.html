     'The Bachelor' Recap: Iowa native Mercedes Northup brings home bacon on night one
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nothing compared to Iowa native Mercedes Northup's night one entrance during the Jan. 23 season premiere of "The Bachelor."
During a drama-tinged episode featuring one pesty contender and several overblown personalities, the social media marketer's "Iowa Nice" demeanor was on full display.
"This is Henry," Northup later said before the trio walked together on the stony Bachelor mansion ground.
"I am from Iowa, I grew up on a farm, and I actually showed pigs growing up," Northup explained.
Viewers can tune in and see if Northup asks Shallcross, "can I squeal you for a second?"

     ‘Boring’ Bachelor Kisses 8 Women During Premiere, Sends One Home Early
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We’re in for a very traditional season with a sincere but boring Bachelor.
Network exec Robert Mills went so far as to tweet a plea ahead of the episode: “If you aren’t excited about Zach or think he’s boring, please blame US!
For the record, Zach did not set a record for most Night 1 kisses; Season 24’s notoriously messy Bachelor, Peter Weber, still holds that record with 12 snogs in one evening.
Does that mean he’s boring?
But after years of dudes who specialize in peacocking, could a boring Bachelor be just the thing Bachelor Nation needs?

And this guy Zach, he’s just at that point in his life when he’s ready to settle down – ready to find his wife.
“I’m just a dude who loves family, football, and frozen pizza,” he said – and I fell asleep.

I’m not privy to those conversations, but if I were part of that discussion, I don’t think there’s one frontrunner — I would say there’s probably a couple frontrunners.
I don’t envy the people that make those decisions because I don’t think that’s very easy.
Moving forward, I don’t know what their plan is, whether or not they’re thinking about maybe having two Bachelors down the road.
I think he has all the qualities, and I think he’s so deserving.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No, the prospect of Zach being the Bachelor didn’t scare her off (though he and his deep voice certainly tried).
I get it — just like Zach, I’m everyone’s second choice.
Everyone who watched Rachel and Gabby’s Bachelorette season knows Zach as … That Guy.
Thus, the first 15 minutes of this premiere are dedicated to making Zach into a Real Human Boy, not just Mike Fleiss’s Bachelor Ken doll.
But once Greer gets the first-impression rose, Madison really starts to lose it.
