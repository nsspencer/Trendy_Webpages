     Duke basketball freshman Dariq Whitehead leaves ACC game at Virginia Tech with injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Duke freshman Dariq Whitehead suffered an injury to his left leg during the second half of the Blue Devils’ 78-75 loss at Virginia Tech on Monday night.
Projected as a first-round pick in June’s NBA Draft, the 6-7 Whitehead suffered what the team called a lower leg injury and didn’t play over the final 17:10.
After the game, Duke coach Jon Scheyer said he hadn’t had a chance to get a full report from the team’s medical staff, so he was uncertain about Whitehead’s availability.
Whitehead immediately reached for the back of his left leg and began limping.
He scored 10 points on 4 of 6 shooting against Virginia Tech prior to his injury.
