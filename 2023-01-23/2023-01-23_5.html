     Doja Cat, a picture of 'Inferno,' was covered in paint and 30,000 crystals at Haute Couture Week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The singer's arrival at the Petit Palais in Paris marked a dramatic start to Schiaparelli's Couture Spring-Summer 2023 show, the opening event of the biannual Haute Couture Week in Paris.
Dubbed "Inferno Couture," the label's latest collection was inspired by Dante's "Inferno" and the nine circles of hell, according to Roseberry's show notes.
Doja Cat stuns at the Schiaparelli show in 30,000 Swarovski crystals.
The makeup artist also posted a behind-the-scenes timelapse video showing her team painting the star's skin and applying thousands of crystals by hand.
In a caption for another video, McGrath described the singer's "sublime patience" as "inspiring."

     Summary: Doja Cat appeared at Paris Fashion Week – as part of Schiaparelli’s Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2023 show – with 30,000 ruby red Swarovski crystals applied to her body.
Sharing a video of the end result on Instagram, McGrath wrote: “The final product was a magical, mesmerising masterpiece of sparkling brilliance.”AdvertisementDoja isn’t the only artist who has appeared as part of shows at this year’s Paris Fashion Week.
Last week, Rosalía delivered a live performance for Louis Vuitton Men’s Fall/Winter 2023 show at the Louvre, playing cuts from all three of her studio albums.
Doja Cat’s last album, ‘Planet Her’, arrived in 2021, earning the singer and rapper her first Grammy Award for SZA collaboration ‘Kiss Me More’.
Last year, she featured on Tyga‘s ‘Freaky Deaky’ and appeared on Post Malone‘s ‘Twelve Carat Toothache’ cut ‘I Like You (A Happier Song)’.

     The Doja Cat–Approved Brand Using Metal as Fabric
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In her music video for the hit “Woman,” Doja Cat appears wearing a silver metal beaded two-piece set.
The outfit itself—a kind of seductive and skin-baring chainmail—and the eight others like it in the music video are mesmerizing.
Today Jeniece Blanchet—the designer behind them and the label Jèblanc—is releasing her first ready-to-wear collection, Light.
Last September, Blanchet collaborated with designer Edvin Thompson of Theophilio on a beaded bandeau top featured in look eight of his runway collection.
Photo: Sara KhalidBefore launching Jèblanc, Blanchet worked as a stylist in New York dressing both friends and private clients until she moved to Los Angeles to launch her brand.

     Summary: Doja Cat turned heads when she arrived at the Schiaparelli Haute Couture Spring Summer 2023 show for Paris Fashion Week on Monday (Jan. 23) covered head to toe in red jewels and makeup.
The fashion show featured the likes of Naomi Campbell, Shalom Harlow and Irina Shayk strutting down the runway in haute couture gowns embroidered with giant animal heads in a nod to Dante’s Inferno.
Kylie Jenner was also seated front row during the presentation with a giant lion’s head attached to her black dress.

     Summary: Ahead of the Schiaparelli Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2023 show in Paris, Doja Cat spent nearly five hours having 30,000 ruby red Swarovski crystals applied all over her body by hand.
“Such a pleasure working with the gorgeous Doja Cat and the amazing Daniel Roseberry on the ‘Doja’s Inferno’ look for Schiaparelli’s FW23 Haute Couture collection,” McGrath wrote on Instagram.
“Doja’s sublime patience during the 4 hours and 58 minutes it took to create the look with #TeamPatMcGrath, which was covered in over 30,000 hand-applied Swarovski Crystals, was inspiring.
Evocative of sublime sculptures; a true feast for the eyes.”When Doja Cat shaved her head last year, her eyebrows went, too.
“I have never felt more beautiful in my entire life, which is very strange,” the rapper told Dazed just after the transformation.

     Summary: She was also clad in a Schiaparelli ensemble that involved an opaque red bodice, a similarly crystal-studded skirt, a long red shawl and red knee-high boots.
“The Doja Cat look was fantastic,” Angharad Coates, an art and design PR executive based between Paris and NYC, told The Daily Beast.
“It’s right in line with Elsa Schiaparelli’s love of surrealism and artistic envelope-pushing, totally in line with the Maison’s history.
And as a Leo woman, I adored the lion look.
“Hair looks fucking terrible and the whole look just reeks of ‘daddy got me this lion plush at FAO Schwarz.’”Is Doja Cat’s look just the first of many wild fashion week looks to come?

     Summary: For her latest over-the-top act, at Schiaparelli’s Haute Couture Fashion Week show in Paris, she stepped out covered in 30,000 Swarovski crystals.
She was then topped off with meticulously hand-applied Swarovski crystals.
Pat McGrath was behind the head-turning look, and Doja wore the artist’s Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick in Elson 4 — a vivid blue-red that blended seamlessly into her painted skin.
Today was the first day of the Haute Couture shows, so this might only be the beginning of a week full of epicness for Doja.
One thing’s for sure: She’s not afraid to push the limits and serve a full camp look that truly embodies the meaning of haute couture.
