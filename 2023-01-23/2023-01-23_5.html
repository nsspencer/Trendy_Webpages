     Summary: Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a high ankle sprain during Saturday's divisional-round victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, a league source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The nature of the injury to Mahomes' right ankle was confirmed Sunday by an MRI, which showed no other damage, a source told Schefter.
"Obviously, I have a lot of adrenaline going right now, so we'll see how it feels.
Chiefs coach Andy Reid noted after Saturday night's game that Mahomes has played through ankle injuries before.
Mahomes initially resisted the Chiefs' requests that he retreat to the locker room to have the ankle X-rayed, though he eventually relented.

     Summary: Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes did everything he could to stay out on the field in the 27-20 AFC divisional game win over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Saturday night.
He plans to do the same in the AFC championship as well.
Mahomes suffered a high-ankle sprain after Jaguars pass rusher Arden Key fell on his ankle in the first half of the game, according to multiple reports.

The Chiefs will certainly do what they can to allow Mahomes to be more mobile, but a high-ankle sprain normally takes weeks to fully heal.

     Summary: Pollard earned the first Pro Bowl selection of his career in 2022 and led the Cowboys' two-headed rushing attack with 1,007 yards on 193 carries -- 38 fewer carries than his running mate, Ezekiel Elliott.
Pollard is a pending free agent entering his age-26 season, ranked No.
Although Dallas' entire running attack was held at bay by San Francisco during Sunday's 19-12 loss, Pollard was pacing the team with 22 rushing yards when he departed the game.
Pollard's breakout campaign this year coincided with Elliott failing to eclipse 100 rushing yards in a single game.
The Cowboys' already unenviable balancing act regarding how to keep one or both running backs on the roster moving forward is now even more difficult.

     Chiefs Patrick Mahomes Has A High Ankle Sprain, Here’s What This Means
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, apparently, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a different type of high during the game: a high ankle sprain.
High ankle sprains are less common than low ankle sprains, which is why low ankle sprains are often referred to as common ankle sprain.
High ankle sprains comprise about 14% of all ankle sprains, according to a post by sports medicine physician Nicholas Sgrignoli, MD, on the Hospital for Special Surgery website.
Given the anatomy, the mechanism by which high ankle sprains occur is different.
The location of the high ankle sprain can mean that symptoms aren’t as severe as the damage, making you underestimate your injury.
