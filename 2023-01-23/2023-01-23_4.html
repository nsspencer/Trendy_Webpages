     Jury selection for Alex Murdaugh trial begins Monday in South Carolina double slaying
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The South Carolina trial for local lawyer and prominent figure Alex Murdaugh begins Monday with jury selection in the shooting deaths of his wife and one of their two sons.
Murdaugh, 54, is accused in the double slaying of Paul, 22, and Murdaugh's wife, Maggie, 52, in June 2021.
ALEX MURDAUGH'S SON PAUL MURDAUGH SUSTAINED GRISLY FATAL INJURY: EXPERTProsecutors say he used a shotgun to blow off his son's head, which was "severed" from his body, according to court papers.
Maggie was shot with a semiautomatic rifle five times — including in the back of the head — and died about 30 yards from her son, court papers allege.
Since the double slaying, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) reopened investigations into the mysterious 2015 death of Buster’s classmate Stephen Smith, with whom Buster was rumored to be having a secret affair.

     Alex Murdaugh goes on trial in 2021 killings of wife, son
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: THE KILLINGS AND EVIDENCEMurdaugh, 54, told police he found Maggie, 52, and their son, Paul, 22, dead outside their Colleton County home on June 7, 2021.
Authorities released little information about the killings beyond saying that Maggie Murdaugh was killed with a rifle and Paul Murdaugh with a shotgun.
There is a video from Paul Murdaugh's phone with a timestamp not long before the killings.
Prosecutors said the killings gave Murdaugh sympathy and, more importantly, allowed him to hide his thefts and other crimes.
Police said Paul Murdaugh was driving the boat while grossly intoxicated and he faced criminal charges when the teen died.
