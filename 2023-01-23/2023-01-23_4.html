     Doja Cat, a picture of 'Inferno,' was covered in paint and 30,000 crystals at Haute Couture Week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The singer's arrival at the Petit Palais in Paris marked a dramatic start to Schiaparelli's Couture Spring-Summer 2023 show, the opening event of the biannual Haute Couture Week in Paris.
Dubbed "Inferno Couture," the label's latest collection was inspired by Dante's "Inferno" and the nine circles of hell, according to Roseberry's show notes.
Doja Cat stuns at the Schiaparelli show in 30,000 Swarovski crystals.
The makeup artist also posted a behind-the-scenes timelapse video showing her team painting the star's skin and applying thousands of crystals by hand.
In a caption for another video, McGrath described the singer's "sublime patience" as "inspiring."

     The Doja Cat–Approved Brand Using Metal as Fabric
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In her music video for the hit “Woman,” Doja Cat appears wearing a silver metal beaded two-piece set.
The outfit itself—a kind of seductive and skin-baring chainmail—and the eight others like it in the music video are mesmerizing.
Today Jeniece Blanchet—the designer behind them and the label Jèblanc—is releasing her first ready-to-wear collection, Light.
Last September, Blanchet collaborated with designer Edvin Thompson of Theophilio on a beaded bandeau top featured in look eight of his runway collection.

     Summary: Ahead of the Schiaparelli Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2023 show in Paris, Doja Cat spent nearly five hours having 30,000 ruby red Swarovski crystals applied all over her body by hand.
“Such a pleasure working with the gorgeous Doja Cat and the amazing Daniel Roseberry on the ‘Doja’s Inferno’ look for Schiaparelli’s FW23 Haute Couture collection,” McGrath wrote on Instagram.
“Doja’s sublime patience during the 4 hours and 58 minutes it took to create the look with #TeamPatMcGrath, which was covered in over 30,000 hand-applied Swarovski Crystals, was inspiring.
Evocative of sublime sculptures; a true feast for the eyes.”When Doja Cat shaved her head last year, her eyebrows went, too.
“I have never felt more beautiful in my entire life, which is very strange,” the rapper told Dazed just after the transformation.

     Summary: For her latest over-the-top act, at Schiaparelli’s Haute Couture Fashion Week show in Paris, she stepped out covered in 30,000 Swarovski crystals.
She was then topped off with meticulously hand-applied Swarovski crystals.
Pat McGrath was behind the head-turning look, and Doja wore the artist’s Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick in Elson 4 — a vivid blue-red that blended seamlessly into her painted skin.
Today was the first day of the Haute Couture shows, so this might only be the beginning of a week full of epicness for Doja.
One thing’s for sure: She’s not afraid to push the limits and serve a full camp look that truly embodies the meaning of haute couture.
