     49ers news: Dak Prescott, Cowboys want playoff revenge vs. Niners
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Matchup Dallas Cowboys 12-5 San Francisco 49ers 13-4 6:30 p.m.
ET Fox 49ers -4The 49ers defeated Dak Prescott and the Cowboys in the Wild Card round of the NFL playoffs a year ago, and Dallas hasn’t quite gotten over it.
Instead, it’ll be the Dallas Cowboys advancing after they soundly defeated Brady and Co. on Monday night in the Wild Card round.
Damn right,” Prescott said of last year’s defeat to the Niners serving as a motivator, via Michael Gehlken of the Dallas Morning News.
However, San Francisco is a much more complete team, too, improving upon what was already a good defense in 2021 and making it the No.
