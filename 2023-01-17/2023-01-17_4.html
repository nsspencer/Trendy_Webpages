     Summary: Matchup Dallas Cowboys 12-5 San Francisco 49ers 13-4 6:30 p.m.
ET Fox 49ers -4The 49ers defeated Dak Prescott and the Cowboys in the Wild Card round of the NFL playoffs a year ago, and Dallas hasn’t quite gotten over it.
Instead, it’ll be the Dallas Cowboys advancing after they soundly defeated Brady and Co. on Monday night in the Wild Card round.
Damn right,” Prescott said of last year’s defeat to the Niners serving as a motivator, via Michael Gehlken of the Dallas Morning News.
However, San Francisco is a much more complete team, too, improving upon what was already a good defense in 2021 and making it the No.

     Titans hiring 49ers director of player personnel Ran Carthon as new general manager
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ran Carthon has been tabbed as the man to lead a Tennessee Titans turnaround.
The Titans have finalized the hire of Carthon, the San Francisco 49ers director of player personnel, as their new general manager, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo reported Tuesday.
Carthon will succeed Jon Robinson, who was fired during a 2022 season that Tennessee finished with its first losing record since 2015.
Carthon's father, Maurice, had a lengthy NFL career, most notably with the New York Giants, whom he won two Super Bowls with.
As the Niners are poised for a Divisional Round matchup with the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday, they'll be losing Carthon after seven seasons with the organization -- the last two in his role as director of player personnel.

Carthon, 41, has spent two seasons as the director of player personnel for the San Francisco 49ers.
Carthon played two NFL seasons as a backup running back and return specialist for the Indianapolis Colts from 2005-06.
Carthon takes over for Jon Robinson, who was fired after a Week 13 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.
Carthon will oversee whether the Titans give it another run with this core or opt instead for a dramatic retool.
