     Summary: Matchup Dallas Cowboys 12-5 San Francisco 49ers 13-4 6:30 p.m.
ET Fox 49ers -4The 49ers defeated Dak Prescott and the Cowboys in the Wild Card round of the NFL playoffs a year ago, and Dallas hasn’t quite gotten over it.
Instead, it’ll be the Dallas Cowboys advancing after they soundly defeated Brady and Co. on Monday night in the Wild Card round.
Damn right,” Prescott said of last year’s defeat to the Niners serving as a motivator, via Michael Gehlken of the Dallas Morning News.
However, San Francisco is a much more complete team, too, improving upon what was already a good defense in 2021 and making it the No.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ran Carthon has been tabbed as the man to lead a Tennessee Titans turnaround.
The Titans have finalized the hire of Carthon, the San Francisco 49ers director of player personnel, as their new general manager, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo reported Tuesday.
Carthon will succeed Jon Robinson, who was fired during a 2022 season that Tennessee finished with its first losing record since 2015.
Tennessee hired Carthon from a pool of candidates that included its former director of player personnel Monti Ossenfort, who was hired as the Arizona Cardinals GM, Titans vice president of player of personnel Ryan Cowden and Bills senior director of pro personnel Malik Boyd, among other.
Carthon's father, Maurice, had a lengthy NFL career, most notably with the New York Giants, whom he won two Super Bowls with.
