     Jim Schwartz to be the new Cleveland Browns defensive coordinator
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Browns are turning to Tennessee Titans senior defensive assistant Jim Schwartz to be their next defensive coordinator, a league source confirmed to the Beacon Journal.
The Browns will be the fourth time in Schwartz's coaching career that he's served as a defensive coordinator.
While Schwartz was defensive coordinator in 2019, Berry served as Vice President of Football Operations before he returned to the Browns in his current role as general manager.
During that time, he learned under defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis.
When defensive coordinator Gregg Williams (a future Browns coach) left to become the Bills head coach in 2001, Schwartz was elevated to be his replacement.

     Summary: Former Super Bowl-winning defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz is returning to Cleveland.
Schwartz rose to prominence as the Tennessee Titans defensive coordinator (2001-2008), which helped him land the Detroit Lions head coaching gig.
Schwartz helped the Lions return to the postseason for the first time in over a decade but bottomed out, going 29-51 in five seasons.
After his stint as a head coach, the fiery Schwartz returned to defensive coordinator duties.
Schwartz left Eagles following the 2020 season, returning to Tennessee as a senior defensive assistant for the past two campaigns.
