    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

     A losing Republican candidate in N.M. is charged over shootings at homes of Democrats
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just before that attack, police allege, Peña had urged the gunmen to aim lower when they shot at politicians' houses.
The evidence against Peña includes confidential witness testimony, cellphone records, bullet casings and surveillance footage, according to Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina.
The last shooting brought a breakthroughFor the final shooting, Peña allegedly came along and pulled the trigger on one of the weapons, said Albuquerque Police Deputy Commander Kyle Hartsock.
According to the criminal complaint, a confidential witness told detectives that Peña apparently took part because he was unhappy the bullets hit high on the homes and the shootings took place late at night.
Tests later confirmed that the Glock had been used in the shooting at Lopez's home.

Ballistics, cellphone data and an informant were key.https://t.co/I18qg7ZPXC pic.twitter.com/7DMKhp76jN — Elise Kaplan (@EliseKapNM) January 17, 2023Police say Pena paid four men to carry out the drive-by shootings, and participated in one of them.
Kyle Hartsock found that Pena had sent Barboa’s exact address to Demetrio Trujillo, who searched for it in Apple maps and texted it to Jose Trujillo.
They sold us out to the highest bidder” and “they were literally laughing at us while they were doing it.” He also sent a photo of Jose Trujillo eating a hamburger surrounded by guns and a photo of himself and Jose Trujillo in a car.
For the first shooting, the witness said, Demetrio Trujillo and two brothers were paid $500 to split between the three of them.
