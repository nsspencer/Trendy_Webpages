    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A powerful winter storm will bring heavy snow to the Denver metro area and all of northeast Colorado starting Tuesday evening.
Snow covered roads will make travel difficult starting with the tail end of the Tuesday evening commute.
CBSThere will be enough snow combined with wind gusts up to 40 mph to cause road closures on the plains and extremely slow travel in the Denver metro area.
That storm officially brought Denver 7.1 inches of snow.
This storm could bring up to twice that amount to parts of the metro area.

     Winter Storm Arrives Wednesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clouds quickly thicken back up overnight as our winter storm approaches.
Late Wednesday morning, the snow and wintry mix will start to move into the Omaha metro from the southwest.
Areas along and south of I-80 likely start with some wintry mix of rain, a few pockets of freezing rain, and snow.
The best chance for the wintry mix and snow during the morning commute will be southwest of Omaha.
If it arrives in Omaha during the morning commute, it likely won't be enough to cause any travel issues yet.

     Potential winter storm to create travel headaches for your Thursday morning commute
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WEATHER ALERTS: In anticipation of this winter storm, the National Weather Service has scheduled winter storm watches for most of the viewing area, which go into effect at midnight tomorrow night, remaining in effect until 6pm on Thursday evening.
We will continue to monitor these alerts regarding whether or not they are upgraded to winter weather advisories, or winter storm warnings.
A potential incoming winter storm has prompted the NWS to schedule winter storm watches for the area.
(WEAU)SNOWFALL AMOUNTS: While it is a bit early to call the forecast snow totals due to uncertainty on the exact track, plan for several inches of a wet, heavy snow.
IMPACTS: With the wet and heavy snow, slush on the roadways, especially on roadways that have remained untreated, will create very slick travel.

     Denver braces for heavy snow as major winter storm brings travel trouble to Plains, Midwest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "A lot of that is going to be during the day (Wednesday)," FOX Weather meteorologist Britta Merwin said.
"By the time we wake up (Wednesday) morning, many of you will have over 8 inches of snow," Merwin said.
You may be thinking that Denver is used to so much snow falling during a winter storm in January, but it's actually been quite a while.
The most recent January storm that dropped more than a foot of snow was back in 1992 when Denver received 14.8 inches of snow.
In a typical winter, Denver picks up 6.4 inches of snow during the month of January.
