     Denver braces for heavy snow as major winter storm brings travel trouble to Plains, Midwest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "A lot of that is going to be during the day (Wednesday)," FOX Weather meteorologist Britta Merwin said.
"By the time we wake up (Wednesday) morning, many of you will have over 8 inches of snow," Merwin said.
You may be thinking that Denver is used to so much snow falling during a winter storm in January, but it's actually been quite a while.
The most recent January storm that dropped more than a foot of snow was back in 1992 when Denver received 14.8 inches of snow.
In a typical winter, Denver picks up 6.4 inches of snow during the month of January.

     Winter Storm Warnings from Denver to Omaha
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Also known as a “Colorado Low”, these systems tend to bring heavy snow into the Midwest and even sometimes to the Northeast.
For this system, Winter Storm Warnings (pink) and Winter Weather Advisories (purple) have been issued for the high plains of Colorado through the Midwest.
In addition to heavy snow, areas of blowing snow will create low visibility through the Plains especially late tonight and Wednesday morning.
Upper MidwestThrough the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes snow totals won’t be quite as impressive and there are multiple reasons for this.
First – there is not as much orographic lift to enhance snowfall totals through the area.
