"By the time we wake up (Wednesday) morning, many of you will have over 8 inches of snow," Merwin said.
You may be thinking that Denver is used to so much snow falling during a winter storm in January, but it's actually been quite a while.

In a typical winter, Denver picks up 6.4 inches of snow during the month of January.

     Summary: Also known as a “Colorado Low”, these systems tend to bring heavy snow into the Midwest and even sometimes to the Northeast.
For this system, Winter Storm Warnings (pink) and Winter Weather Advisories (purple) have been issued for the high plains of Colorado through the Midwest.
In addition to heavy snow, areas of blowing snow will create low visibility through the Plains especially late tonight and Wednesday morning.
As the Colorado low forms Tuesday, snow will reach the I-25 metro corridor, heavy at times tonight through early Wednesday morning.
