     Nets' Kyrie Irving: Late addition to injury report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Irving is listed as questionable for Tuesday's game against the Spurs due to right calf soreness.
Irving was a late addition to the injury report, which isn't a good sign ahead of the 8 p.m.
ET opening tip.
The severity of the calf issue remains unclear, but if the point guard is unable to suit up, Edmond Sumner would likely join the starting lineup, while Seth Curry, Joe Harris and Patty Mills would be candidates for increased roles off the bench.

     Nets’ Kyrie Irving questionable to play vs Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Feb 6, 2022; Denver, Colorado, USA; Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving (11) reacts towards guard Cam Thomas (24) in the second quarter against the Denver Nuggets at Ball Arena.
Now they might have to dig deeper, with the Nets listing Kyrie Irving as questionable to play at the start of their five-game road trip.
Second-year guard Cam Thomas is expected to step up if Irving joins Durant on the sidelines.
But the Nets need more than Thomas’ scoring punch to survive.
The Nets need more from Ben Simmons who isn’t on the injury report after sitting out Sunday’s 112-102 loss to Oklahoma City Thunder.

     Kyrie Irving final injury update for Nets-Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyrie Irving, who was a late addition to the Nets’ injury report due to calf tightness, has been ruled out, per the team’s Twitter account.
Irving struggled in his first two performances without his co-star, shooting 16-of-44 (36.4 percent) from the field and 4-of-18 from 3-point land (22.2 percent).
Despite the struggles, Irving said his approach will remain consistent as he looks to lead the Nets through the shorthanded period.
“I’m doing the best job I can, I wish I would make a few more shots and be efficient,” Kyrie Irving said.
Simmons, Seth Curry and T.J. Warren will be tasked with generating offense for a unit already struggling without Durant- and now Kyrie Irving.

     Injury Report: Kyrie Irving's Updated Status vs. Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets have added superstar guard Kyrie Irving to their injury report ahead of Tuesday's game vs. the San Antonio Spurs.
The team will also be missing David Duke Jr (G League two-way), Kessler Edwards (G League assignment), and Dru Smith (G League two-way) who will all be with Brooklyn's G League affiliate, the Long Island Nets.
On the bright side, Brooklyn will have their star point forward Ben Simmons available for Tuesday's game vs. San Antonio.
San Antonio will also be missing a few G League players: Dominick Barlow, Charles Bassey, and Blake Wesley.
Brooklyn has swept the season series over San Antonio in each of the last two seasons.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Maybe more layups or drives for some easy baskets would help, especially since one side effect could be the team getting to the line more.
GO DEEPER Nets lose without Kevin Durant as Ben Simmons fails to score, Kyrie Irving strugglesIt is obvious that Ben Simmons has other issues beyond a cranky back/knee.
I think Simmons’ impact goes beyond the box score.
What are some of the Nets potential trade targets ahead of the NBA trade deadline?
I think Vaughn has shown since taking over that he’s simplified the offense and emphasized defense.
