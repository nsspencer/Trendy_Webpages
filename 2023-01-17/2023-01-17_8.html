     Report: Olympic Sprinter Usain Bolt’s $10 Million ‘Retirement Funds’ Wiped Out After Massive Scam Leaves Him With Only $2,000 in His Account
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Decorated Olympic athlete Usain Bolt has begun the new year with a financial loss, according to Jamaica Observer.
Though there were initial suspicions raised in August 2022, the scammer was not caught — and the potential recovery of the stolen assets is unknown at this time.
Bolt’s financial hardship likely included money he earned from his Puma ambassadorship that began in 2013, reportedly totaling $10 million each year, according to Reuters.
Bolt shared a tagged Instagram photo supporting the brand in November last year, wearing a black, coral and turquoise sweatsuit with golden yellow color-blocked sneakers (which are currently unavailable) from the brand.
