     Andy Murray Saves MP, Holds Off Matteo Berrettini In Five-Set Australian Open Epic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The marquee matchup of the Australian Open first round far exceeded the hype, as Andy Murray edged 13th seed Matteo Berrettini in an instant classic decided by a fifth-set tie-break.
Murray came tantalisingly close to match point twice in the fourth-set tie-break, only to be thwarted by moments of Berrettini brilliance.
Prior to the fifth set, Berrettini had won his past nine tie-breaks at the Australian Open, including a fifth-set tie-break against Carlos Alcaraz last year.
By closing out the match, Murray extended a streak of his own: It has been 18 years since he has lost from two-sets-to-love up.
Murray's 50th Australian Open win earned him a measure of revenge against Berrettini, who beat him at the 2022 US Open and brought a three-match ATP Head2Head win streak into Melbourne.
