     Senators Marco Rubio and Steve Daines that featured screenshots of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressing members of Congress on Saturday.
The Ukrainian Ambassador very intentionally asked each of us on the zoom to NOT share anything on social media during the meeting to protect the security of President Zelenskyy.
Some social media users flooded the tweets, demanding that Twitter take them down for potentially endangering Zelensky's safety amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Demands for the posts' removals caused Rubio to trend on Twitter Saturday afternoon.
However, Phillips noted in his tweet that they were asked to not share anything on social media only during the meeting, which has since ended.

“Dude, what the hell is wrong with you?” Steele tweeted.
The Ukrainian president also called for an oil embargo on Russia, which he characterized as the most significant sanction the United States could impose.
During the call, Zelensky said it might be the last time U.S. lawmakers see him alive.

Phillips noted that the "Ukrainian ambassador very intentionally asked each of us on the Zoom to NOT share anything on social media during the meeting to protect the security of President Zelenskyy."
During the call, Zelenskyy asked if a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace could be imposed on Russian-made aircraft, multiple people on the call told NBC News.
The Ukrainian leader also spoke to lawmakers about imposing sanctions to stop Russia from using Visa and Mastercard, said three people on the call.
“President Zelenskyy made a desperate plea for Eastern European countries to provide Russian-made planes to Ukraine.

     Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Steve Daines of Montana posted pictures of Zelensky on their respective Twitter accounts while the Zoom meeting was in progress.
Republicans called out the senators, too, with former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele taking to Twitter to condemn Rubio specifically.
During the call, Zelensky asked for a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace to be imposed on Russian-made aircraft, multiple sources told NBC.
Schumer reportedly told Zelensky that Congress will get $10 billion in economic, humanitarian and security assistance for the Ukrainian people 'quickly.'
Around 6 pm EST on Saturday, hours after the Zoom meeting with US representatives, Zelensky posted a video of another meeting with Elon Musk that appeared to be filmed at the same location.
