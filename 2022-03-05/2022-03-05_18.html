     It was a strong final regular-season moment for the Tennessee basketball freshman, who could have played his final game at Thompson-Boling Arena.
Chandler said he is not thinking beyond the current season and whether or not he will enter the NBA Draft.
"I just want to continue to just get better every single day in practice," Chandler said.
"Get ready for the SEC Tournament next week and get ready for March Madness.
We didn’t get to be SEC (regular-season) champions, but I want to win the SEC Tournament, eventually make it to the Final Four, win March Madness.

     Dye also played 30 minutes for the Lady Vols, marking her highest minute count in conference play this season.
With Dye taking a backseat after the first quarter in terms of scoring, another Lady Vols' senior wreaked havoc on the Alabama defense: Rae Burrell.
The fans' energy combined with the heightened energy Tennessee brought to the court allowed the Lady Vols, especially the freshmen, to remain calm and confident.
Burrell led the Lady Vols in assists with seven, Miles finished second with four, and Jordan Walker logged three.
The highest +/- of the night for the Lady Vols was Tess Darby, who bounced back significantly after a poor performance against LSU.

     Tennessee basketball freshman guard Zakai Zeigler saluted the fans during the Arkansas game Saturday at Thompson-Boling Arena after an emotional week for he and his family.
Charmane Zeigler, Zakai Zeigler's mother, lost her house and all of her and her family's possessions in a fire in the New York City borough of Queens last weekend.
UT and its compliance office helped start a GoFundMe donation page in support of the Zeigler family on Wednesday, which raised $363,007 with more than 5,000 individual donations.
"From the bottom of our hearts, thank you to everyone who donated and kept our family in your prayers."
Flash forward to Saturday, when Zeigler entered the Arkansas game with 16:26 in the first half to a thunderous ovation.

But coming just short shouldn’t remove much shine from the way Tennessee played the final seven weeks of the regular season.
As always, this Tennessee team has a knack for making you think or say, “Yeah … but.”“That offense can be so good.
Notice I’m not discussing much about the results of the SEC Tournament, because we all know what’ll probably happen in Tampa, don’t we?
You could put the mid-90s Chicago Bulls in orange uniforms, and they wouldn’t win the SEC Tournament.
