     WATCH: Jordan Davis runs stunning sub 5-second 40-yard dash at NFL combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 10-yard split measures get-off ability are a key number for defensive linemen, with that time largely being seen as more important than the full 40-yard dash.
Aaron Donald’s 10-yard split was a 1.63, while weighing 56 pounds less than Davis.
In his career at Georgia, Davis had only 7.0 sacks.
He knows he has to answer questions about his pass-rushing and conditioning levels for NFL teams.
Coming in at 340 pounds helps with his conditioning, as he said he played last season between 350 and 360 pounds.

     Buffalo Bills reportedly met with DT Jordan Davis at NFL Combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The thing that stands out for Jordan Davis is just how big he is at 6’6″ and 341 pounds.
Buffalo Bills meet with Jordan Davis at the NFL CombineEven if the Buffalo Bills bring back Harrison Phillips and Justin Zimmer, two players who are set to be free agents this offseason, the defensive tackle position is one that they should address.
On Friday, Matt Parrino tweeted that Jordan Davis has met with the Bills during the NFL Combine.
Jordan Davis is kicking us off this morning.
For the Buffalo Bills, plugging him next to Ed Oliver would give the defense a good duo on the interior.

     Video: Jordan Davis’ jaw-dropping 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The odds of the Seattle Seahawks landing former Georgia Bulldogs standout Jordan Davis are slim and none.
Davis is listed at 6’6” and 341 lbs and he can RUN.
Have you ever seen a man of his size run a 40-yard dash this fast?
Davis’ official time was rounded to an even faster 4.78, which when you consider his size is one of the most amazing feats you’ll ever see in a 40-yard dash.
Here’s some perspective on how fast Davis sprinted:Now we got an official 4.78 forty for Jordan Davis at 341 pounds.

     The eight defensive tackles in combine history to outpace Jordan Davis' 4.78 40-yard dash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s relatively safe to say that no draft prospect made more of a splash at the 2022 scouting combine than did Georgia defensive tackle Jordan Davis.
At 6-foot-6 and 341 pounds, Davis somehow ran an unofficial 4.82 40-yard dash that was corrected DOWN to a 4.78 time when it was made official.
Davis also had a 1.68-second 10-yard split, which might be even more ridiculous for a man his size.
Georgia DT Jordan Davis’s 4.78 40-yard dash is the fastest by any player over 310 pounds at the combine since at least 2006.
As for the defensive tackle position, only eight defensive tackles have run faster 40-yard dashes in recorded scouting combine history than Davis did, and nobody was close to his weight when they ran it.

     INDIANAPOLIS -- Georgia defensive tackle Jordan Davis -- all 341 pounds of him -- finished the 40-yard dash in 4.78 seconds at the NFL scouting combine Saturday night.
Davis later had a standing broad jump of 10 feet, 3 inches, believed to be the record for a player over 300 pounds.
Former Nebraska defensive tackle Khalil Davis ran a 4.75 40 at the 2020 scouting combine, which was the fastest 40 by a defensive lineman who weighed in at more than 300 pounds since 2006.
Robinson ran a 4.92 in 2014 at 332 pounds; Poe, at 346 pounds, clocked 4.98 seconds at the 2012 combine.
Alabama's Christian Harris, who was a semifinalist for the Butkus Award this past season, ran a 4.44 and was the only other linebacker other than Andersen to run better than a 4.5.

     DT prospect Jordan Davis posts stunning 4.78 40-yard dash at 341 pounds on Day 3 of NFL Combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jeremiah ranks Davis as the No.
17 prospect this year.
There's been discussion about whether he might still be available at a later slotting than that, in part because of doubts about his pass-rushing ability.
With the stunning speed he showed in the 40, and an unofficial 1.68 10-yard split during the run, he's going to put some questions about his athleticism to rest, but perhaps not all.
As NFL Network's Peter Schrager mentioned on Friday's broadcast, Davis played at a heavier weight last season at Georgia and NFL teams will want to see if he can keep his weight down on a consistent basis to ensure he can maintain the type of explosiveness he showed on Friday.

     Jordan Davis NFL Draft: 3 best landing spots after incredible NFL Combine performance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsFormer Georgia defensive lineman Jordan Davis generated a lot of buzz around the league after his incredible NFL Combine performance.
Will he do enough to become a top pick in the 2022 NFL Draft?
Right before the NFL Scouting Combine, The Draft Network projected Davis to the Dallas Cowboys and NFL Media’s Bucky Brooks had Davis going 22nd overall to the Las Vegas Raiders.
According to NFL Draft analyst Kent Lee Platte, Davis’ Relative Athletic Score – measuring a player’s athleticism relative to their dimensions – Davis has the second-highest raw grade in RAS history.
There’s not much to brag about when it comes to Saints defensive tackles.
