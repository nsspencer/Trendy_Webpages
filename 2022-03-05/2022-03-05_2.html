     A boatload of Blue Devils is in Durham for the UNC-Duke basketball clash.
4 Duke Blue Devils (26-4, 16-3 ACC) take on the unranked yet hungry UNC Tar Heels (22-8, 14-5 ACC) at 6 p.m.
And guys like ESPN commentator Jay Bilas and ACC Network analyst Carlos Boozer likely would have been there anyway as part of their job description since both ESPN and the ACC Network will broadcast the game with more than 100 employees on site.
Still, it seems they have all tweeted out their support for Coach K on this historic day.
Stay tuned to Ball Durham for more Duke basketball news and views.

     Duke basketball: Coach K, Blue Devils players react to upset loss at home to North Carolina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     4 Duke Blue Devils were upset by the North Carolina Tar Heels, 94-81, Saturday night in what was legendary head coach Mike Krzyzewski's final home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
North Carolina was able to avenge an 87-67 loss earlier this season in Chapel Hill to Duke and spoil Coach K's curtain call in front of a packed house in Durham.
More than 80 former players and countless other celebrities and athletes were in the building Saturday to witness Coach K's final regular-season contest.
In the loss, Duke was led by Paolo Banchero with 23 points, five rebounds, and five assists.
The loss pushed Duke's final regular-season record to 26-5 entering the ACC Tournament next week.

     Grayson Allen sinks free throw for charity at Duke-UNC game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A free throw contest during halftime of Saturday‚Äôs Duke-UNC matchup gave Grayson Allen the chance to be a hero inside Cameron Indoor Stadium one more time.
The former Blue Devil and current Bucks guard returned to his alma mater as one of 96 former players on-hand for legendary coach Mike Krzyzewski‚Äôs last game.
Allen, the only active NBA player in attendance, had the pleasure of stepping up to the charity stripe with the opportunity to gift a $1,000 to Duke Children‚Äôs Hospital with one made free throw.
Allen's feel-good moment conjured memories of a similar scene from January involving Duke's all-time leading scorer, J.J. Redick.
The sharpshooting 15-year vet, who was also in attendance Saturday, surprisingly missed his charity FT attempt at the halftime of Duke‚Äôs 76‚Äì74 loss to Miami.

     Mike Krzyzewski gives praise to Duke's successful season despite the loss to UNC in his final home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
The basketball world wasn't simply going to watch Krzyzewski, the winningest coach ever, ride off into the sunset.
The game didn't matter much in the standings either.
Funny thing is, Krzyzewski didn't seem to mind all that much.
They weren't here to see Duke win -- even in a game against hated North Carolina.

Banchero and Mark Williams started dominating inside and Duke took its first lead, at 16-15.
Duke still led 41-39 but it felt like Duke could have, maybe should have taken a 10-12 point lead into the locker room.

     4 Duke but everything in the hearts of Blue Devils near and far, rival North Carolina outplayed the Blue Devils when it mattered Saturday night.
In retiring Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski‚Äôs final game at Cameron Indoor Stadium, the Tar Heels rallied from seven points down in the final 13 minutes to beat the Blue Devils 94-81.
The Blue Devils saw their seven-game winning streak halted.
Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski can√≠t believe the call during the first half of Duke√≠s game against UNC at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, N.C., Saturday, March 5, 2022.
Once the Blue Devils calmed down after the game‚Äôs first timeout, they found their footing offensively.
