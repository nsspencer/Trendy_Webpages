    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A boatload of Blue Devils is in Durham for the UNC-Duke basketball clash.
4 Duke Blue Devils (26-4, 16-3 ACC) take on the unranked yet hungry UNC Tar Heels (22-8, 14-5 ACC) at 6 p.m.
And guys like ESPN commentator Jay Bilas and ACC Network analyst Carlos Boozer likely would have been there anyway as part of their job description since both ESPN and the ACC Network will broadcast the game with more than 100 employees on site.
Still, it seems they have all tweeted out their support for Coach K on this historic day.
Stay tuned to Ball Durham for more Duke basketball news and views.

     Coach K sent a letter to Michael Jordan after he chose UNC over Duke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mike Krzyzewski was hired at Duke ahead of the 1980–81 season.
Coincidentally, a top high school player named Michael Jordan was being recruited that same year.
And, as the story goes, North Carolina native Jordan chose Duke’s rival UNC and began his college career in 1981 there.
Various letters from Coach K have gone viral ahead of his final home game in Cameron Indoor on Saturday, and now a letter the longtime Blue Devils coach sent Jordan in 1980 is going viral.
However, what makes it significant this time is the context of knowing how Coach K sent letters throughout his whole 42-year career at Duke.

     Duke basketball shares emotional Coach K tribute video before final home game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Saturday marked legendary Duke Blue Devils basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski's final home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
Over the course of his 42 years as head coach at Duke, Krzyzewski owns a 1,123-306 record and has coached 68 NBA Draft picks (42 in the first round), 37 All-Americans, and nine national players of the year.
Krzyzewski has won five national championships, made 12 final fours, and won the ACC regular-season championship 13 times in his career, including this year’s title.
Prior to Saturday's game tipping off, Duke Men's Basketball played an emotional tribute video to Coach K on the big screen at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
Earlier this week, Krzyzewski previewed today's final home game in his storied career.

     That happened even this week, when Coach K evoked images of his shot blocking center Mark Williams, swatting away questions about the UNC game.
“My total focus is on Pitt,” he said, speaking of the game Duke played on Tuesday night, after press time.
And how lucky I’ve been to have a moment like that to savor, but I’ve had those moments hundreds of times.
Also 110 current or former Duke players that played for Coach K (out of 208 total that played for him at Duke) are here.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Duke's been there for us through the ups and downs and it's all because of what Coach K built.
Out of my price rangeEdward De La Garza has never met Mike Krzyzweski, but he has intimate insight into his day-to-day activities.
De La Garza has been a Duke fan since 1985 when he attached himself to the play of point guard Johnny Dawkins.
He had made his sign the night before, a sweetly penned note to Coach K with hand drawn hearts around the posterboard.
Growing up in North Carolina, she understands the importance of the rivalry, Coach K and what basketball means to this state.
