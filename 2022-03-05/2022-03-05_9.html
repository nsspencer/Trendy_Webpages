    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On a laborious Saturday afternoon, Liverpool toughed out a 1-0 victory over West Ham United.
Bowen injury a major West Ham concernIn the 53rd minute, Jarrod Bowen had to be withdrawn and replaced by Saied Benrhama.
Ironically, this was the day when Bowen became the West Ham leader for consecutive Premier League appearances with 79.
The finishing issues were on full display against Liverpool when West Ham saw not one but two chances cleared off the line.
He brought it down in space but just wasn't able to get the goal that West Ham needed to bring things level.

     Six things spotted in Liverpool vs West Ham as Ibrahima Konaté shines and Sadio Mané resurgent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sadio Mané continued his impressive goal-scoring form when deployed through the middle, setting Liverpool on their way to an important victory.
Mané a menace through the middleSadio Mané was effectively being written off before the African Cup of Nations.
His sign-off goal against Chelsea was his first strike in 10 games, and in general his effectiveness looked greatly reduced from his Liverpool peak.
With the absence of Kostas Tsimikas today, Konaté became the only Liverpool player to have featured in every matchday squad so far this season.
Seeking the goal to kill the game, he brought on Diogo Jota, but it was not Díaz who was sacrificed.
