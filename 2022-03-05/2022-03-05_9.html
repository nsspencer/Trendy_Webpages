     Serghei Spivac hands Greg Hardy third consecutive loss with quick TKO at UFC 272
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mike BohnMMA JunkieSerghei Spivac had little trouble dispatching Greg Hardy at UFC 272, achieving what commentator Joe Rogan called an “easy” victory in the main-card opener.
Spivac (14-3 MMA, 5-3 UFC) used his superior ground arsenal to take down former NFL standout Hardy (7-5 MMA, 4-5 UFC) and pound his way to the TKO at the 2:16 mark of Round 1.
They exchanged strikes, then they tied up in a clinch exchange that resulted in Spivac hip-tossing Hardy to the canvas.
Hardy would get up, but Spivac kept control of the waist and picked Hardy up multiple times.
I know Greg Hardy is a very big opponent, and he has knockout power, but I’m ready for this,” Spivac said in his post-fight interview with Rogan.
