     Kansas basketball officially locked up at least a share of the Big 12 title on Saturday with a 70-63 win over Texas at home.

That Kansas managed to win a share of the Big 12 title with Big 12 Preseason Player of the Year Remy Martin offering minimal contributions this season is a testament to the depth of the KU roster.
