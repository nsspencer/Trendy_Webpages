     Jordan Davis: Georgia defensive tackle runs blazing 40-yard dash at NFL combine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The quarterbacks and wide receivers have been posting blazing times in the 40-yard dash in the 2022 NFL scouting combine.
But on Saturday, defensive lineman Jordan Davis added his name to the conversation.
To provide some perspective, Davis ran a faster 40-yard dash time than Chiefs quarterback and four-time Pro Bowler Patrick Mahomes.
In comparison to the other offensive lineman at the combine, Davis is the second heaviest of the group behind Minnesota’s Daniel Faalele, who weighed at 384.
In addition to Davis, his Georgia teammate Devonte Wyatt clocked a 4.80 second unofficial time in the event while weighing in at 304.

     The thing that stands out for Jordan Davis is just how big he is at 6’6″ and 341 pounds.
Buffalo Bills meet with Jordan Davis at the NFL CombineEven if the Buffalo Bills bring back Harrison Phillips and Justin Zimmer, two players who are set to be free agents this offseason, the defensive tackle position is one that they should address.
On Friday, Matt Parrino tweeted that Jordan Davis has met with the Bills during the NFL Combine.
Jordan Davis is kicking us off this morning.
For the Buffalo Bills, plugging him next to Ed Oliver would give the defense a good duo on the interior.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jeremiah ranks Davis as the No.
17 prospect this year.
There's been discussion about whether he might still be available at a later slotting than that, in part because of doubts about his pass-rushing ability.
With the stunning speed he showed in the 40, and an unofficial 1.68 10-yard split during the run, he's going to put some questions about his athleticism to rest, but perhaps not all.
As NFL Network's Peter Schrager mentioned on Friday's broadcast, Davis played at a heavier weight last season at Georgia and NFL teams will want to see if he can keep his weight down on a consistent basis to ensure he can maintain the type of explosiveness he showed on Friday.
