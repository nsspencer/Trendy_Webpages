     Suns‚Äô Cam Johnson out vs. Bucks Sunday with right quad contusion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Phoenix Suns forward Cam Johnson will not play in Sunday‚Äôs road meeting with the Milwaukee Bucks due to a right quad contusion.
He showed up on Saturday‚Äôs injury report after scoring a career-high 38 points to take down the New York Knicks on Friday.
It was a physical game, as Johnson took a knee to the quad from Knicks center Mitchell Robinson on a drive to the basket during the second quarter.
Johnson also dealt with multiple bumps from Knicks forward Julius Randle throughout the game.
Cam Johnson said last night he took a knee to the quad from Mitchell Robinson when Robinson contested his layup.

     Suns hit with brutal Cam Johnson news after big win vs. Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Phoenix Suns got some bad news ahead of their showdown with the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday.
According to Kellan Olson of 98.7 Arizona Sports, Johnson has been ruled out of the game because of a quad problem.
Apparently, he took a hit to the right thigh from Mitchell Robinson‚Äôs knee, which resulted in a quad contusion.
Cam Johnson has been a major positive for Phoenix in their back-to-back wins, so his absence will be absolutely felt come Sunday.
It is also worth mentioning that he saved the Suns from the verge of defeat against the New York Knicks on Friday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With Chris Paul and Devin Booker both sidelined, the Phoenix Suns need players to step up and keep the team rolling.
Earlier in the game, Randle knocked the wind out of Johnson on an aggressive move that wasn‚Äôt called a foul.
After the game, Johnson explained his thought process as he and Randle got into it.
And I just wanted to win the game for my team, for CP and Book who are out right now."
Having him surround Mikal Bridges and Deandre Ayton while Paul and Booker are out will be huge for the Suns.

     Knicks built up a nice double-digit lead by this point with Julius Randle leading the way at 24 points on 18 shots in 28 minutes.
Johnson at this point was having a decent night by his standards: 14 points through almost three quarters.
But for the under-15 minutes that remained, Johnson turned things up a few notches.
In total, Johnson‚Äôs career-high 38 came on just 16 shots and in just 28 minutes, including nine three-pointers tying the franchise record.
Mikal Bridges ‚Äî who was the first to check on Johnson after the initial hard blow to the chest in the first quarter ‚Äî finished with 20 points on just 11 shots.

The NBA-leading Suns, playing without All-Star guards Chris Paul and Devin Booker, improved to 51-12.
Randle and Johnson were called for technicals after bumping chests and exchanging words.
A referee separated the two, but then Randle barreled through the ref to shove Johnson again, which earned the ejection.
Randle scored 25 points, and Robinson added 17 points and 15 rebounds.

     WATCH: Cam Johnson Scores Career High 38 Points &amp; Hits Game Winner at the Buzzer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Friday night, Phoenix Suns wing Cameron Johnson scored a career-high 38 points and hit a game-winning three at the buzzer to defeat the New York Knicks 115-144.
Johnson purposely held back and trailed Payne, before setting up a good six feet behind the three-point line.
Payne found the trailing Johnson, who stepped into a three-point shot and banked it in for the win just as the buzzer sounded.
The former North Carolina star finished with 38 points on 11-for-16 shooting from the field and 9-for-12 from three.
He was named First-Team All-ACC following the 2018-19 season after he averaged 16.9 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists, and 1.2 steals per game.

‚ÄúI went to box him out, just playing basketball and he hit the heck out of me,‚Äù Johnson said.
Johnson pushed Randle in the back, the two met face to face and Randle responded by pushing him with his left hand in front of the Suns bench.
‚ÄúI told our guys after the interaction that happened, I said, ‚ÄòOK, we‚Äôre going to win this game,‚Äô‚Äù Williams said.

     Cam Johnson's angry shooting stroke leads Suns' win for career-high 38
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Johnson shattered his previous career high of 24 points with 38 on Friday night in a 115-114 win over the New York Knicks that ended on Johnson‚Äôs buzzer-beating 3.
Here is Al McCoy calling Cam Johnson's buzzer-beater 3 to walk it off for the Suns!
Through one half of fairly even basketball, it felt like the Suns were on track to eventually pull away.
New York was overselling its defense to dribble penetration, leaving Suns point guard Cam Payne and his team to have a field day kicking the ball out to open shooters.
Without it, New York‚Äôs offense crumbled, all while the Suns fed off what Crowder described as a fight in Johnson‚Äôs eyes.
