    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With 74,479 fans in attendance – the biggest standalone crowd in MLS history – Charlotte showed energy to start the match, but the pace of play was ultimately dictated by the Galaxy, who outshot the home side 15-1 in the opening 45 minutes.
Had it not been for the performance of goalkeeper Kristijan Kahlina, Charlotte could have easily fallen behind in the first half.

     CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - A partial section of fans had to move seats Saturday night during Charlotte FC’s first-ever home game at Bank of America Stadium due to a cellular antenna slip.
A team spokesperson confirmed with WBTV that 20 rows of Section 520 at the stadium were cleared out as an “abundance of caution” after the cellular antenna slipped from its mount.
There were no injuries and fans in those rows were relocated.

     Charlotte FC set Major League Soccer Attendance Record with 74,479 at Bank of America Stadium
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Since the very beginning, Charlotte FC made it a goal to break the all-time Major League Soccer single-match attendance record in their season opener against L.A. Galaxy.
After a little over 2 years, the opportunity to break that record finally came and it did not disappoint.
Charlotte FC have shattered the MLS attendance record and raised the bar with the 74,479 fans who attended the inaugural home match.
The record was previously held by Atlanta United when 73,019 fans attended the MLS Cup Final against the Portland Timbers as well as the 72,548 regular season attendance record also held by Atlanta.
Charlotte FC's record is a testament of the region's passion for soccer and the hard work put in by the Club and its fans alike.

     CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Charlotte FC made a record-breaking home debut Saturday night, setting a Major League Soccer attendance mark of 74,479 in a 1-0 loss to the LA Galaxy.
“Welcome to the largest party Charlotte has known,” Charlotte FC and Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper said to the crowd moments before kickoff.
Even the signature Panthers statues outside the stadium had Charlotte FC scarves draped around their necks for the occasion.
“We've waited for this for a while,” said Lenny Romero, a Charlotte fan who wore a curly wig of Charlotte FC blue.
Still, it would give Charlotte FC a capacity of about 38,000.

     Charlotte FC close to signing Polish winger Kamil Jóźwiak | Charlotte Observer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Charlotte FC is close to finalizing a deal to add Polish winger Kamil Jóźwiak to its roster, a source familiar with the situation told The Observer.
Charlotte FC expressed prior interest in Jóźwiak, who comes from EFL Championship club Derby County led by Wayne Rooney.
Jóźwiak suffered an ankle injury while in earlier talks with Charlotte, which is still looking to fortify its attacking line.
The league’s primary transfer window closes May 4, meaning Jóźwiak could soon start playing with Charlotte once his paperwork is complete.
Jóźwiak has three goals in 22 appearances with the senior Polish national team since making his debut with the squad in 2019.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A section of Charlotte FC fans were evacuated from their seats at Bank of America Stadium Saturday night during the team's inaugural home match against LA Galaxy.
Several members of the WCNC Charlotte team were attending the game when they noticed police directing fans in section 520 to leave.
According to WCNC digital director Blair Shiff, an officer with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said something was potentially about to fall.
WCNC Charlotte digital content producer Anders J. Hare was able to snap a photo of the fully-evacuated section from where he was in the stands, which was across from section 520.
