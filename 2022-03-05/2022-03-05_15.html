     Liverpool closed the gap on Premier League leaders Manchester City to three points after beating West Ham 1-0 at Anfield.
Trent Alexander-Arnold's quick free-kick from his own half caught out the West Ham defence and put Mohamed Salah through on goal but his effort was saved by Lukasz Fabianski.
Liverpool continued to apply the pressure and were rewarded in the 27th minute when Alexander-Arnold volleyed the ball into the box for Sadio Mane to tap home.
The win puts Liverpool three points behind City, who will take on local rivals Manchester United tomorrow.
West Ham, meanwhile, remain fifth after the loss.

'West Ham are a good team and made life difficult,' acknowledged Liverpool skipper Jordan Henderson.
West Ham manager David Moyes had never won at Anfield and their ambition appeared limited in the early stages when they stayed compact and Fabianski was jeered for time-wasting after only 20 minutes.
But West Ham emerged from their shell with surprising effect.
