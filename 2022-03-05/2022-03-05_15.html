    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     21 Texas on Saturday, winning 70-63 to clinch a share of the Big 12 title.
1 seed in next week's Big 12 Tournament by virtue of its better record against No.
Kansas hit 28 of 36 free throws as Texas committed 26 fouls compared to just 18 fouls called on Kansas.
That Kansas managed to win a share of the Big 12 title with Big 12 Preseason Player of the Year Remy Martin offering minimal contributions this season is a testament to the depth of the KU roster.
If one or both of them takes a leap next season like Agbaji did this season, then the Jayhawks will be right back in the Big 12 title conversation.
