     Deji vs Alex Wassabi LIVE RESULTS: Wassabi WINS on split decision as spectator invades ring during main event
    </h2>

     ALEX WASSABI has BEATEN Deji in the showdown of the YouTubers.
A spectator has jumped into the ring during the second round and attempted to hit Wassabi but was pushed out of the ring.
Local boy Deji was left dejected when only one judge gave a decision in his favour, while the other two judges went with American Wassabi.
Anthony Joshua and brother KSI were in the crowd cheering him on but ultimately Deji, 25, couldn't get the job done.
On the undercard, Ryan Taylor was disqualified for a disgraceful headbutt on his opponent DK Money.

     Deji shows off impressive body transformation as he comes in over a STONE lighter for Alex Wassabi fight than he did against Vinnie Hacker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Deji has come in over a stone lighter for his fight with Alex Wassabi than he did for his last bout against Vinnie Hacker.
The YouTuber is currently 0-2 in white collar boxing matches, having previously been stopped by Jake Paul and Hacker.
Last time out especially, Deji sparked concerns with his physique at the weigh-in as he came in at 183lbs (83kg).
Now though, he’s dropped over a stone and weighed in at 168.7lbs (76.5kg) ahead of his fight with Wassabi.
Deji told the Mirror: “When I weighed in at 183lb [vs Hacker], I refuelled and got up to around 205lb – that wasn’t ideal.
