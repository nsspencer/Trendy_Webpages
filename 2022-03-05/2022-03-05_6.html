     Nuggets‚Äô DeMarcus Cousins hangs season-high 31 points: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not forget who he is‚Äù
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The absence of Nikola Jokic (non-COVID illness) didn‚Äôt hurt in the least.
It was the first time Cousins scored at least 31 points since Jan. 22, 2018 ‚Äì five teams ago, when Cousins was with the New Orleans Pelicans.
‚ÄúNobody replaces Nikola Jokic, but Cuz is pretty damn good,‚Äù said Nuggets coach Michael Malone, who‚Äôs been Cousins‚Äô biggest proponent since before he even arrived in Denver.
Once the Bucks cut him ‚Äì a result of a calf strain, according to Cousins ‚Äì Malone and the Nuggets jumped.
On at least two occasions Friday night, Cousins pleaded for Malone to use his challenge call.
