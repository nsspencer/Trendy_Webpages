     Oscar Isaac began his first-ever monologue as the host of Saturday Night Live with an air of self-deprecation: “They actually asked me to host back in 2015 but I said, ‘Nah, I’m not ready.
“This is a kind of a full-circle moment,” Isaac said since the first movie he was ever in was The Avenger.
Like in this scene.”In the next clip, Isaac is a little kid (“acting his heart out”) while you can clearly see his friend’s dad cleaning the pool in the background.
“Now you may be asking, Oscar, why are you using your monologue to show us old home videos?
And the reason is, it’s important to encourage kids to be weirdos,” Isaac said.
