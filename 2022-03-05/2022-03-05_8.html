     Deji vs Alex Wassabi fight LIVE: UK start time, results, undercard and stream
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The boxing return of British YouTube star Deji is finally upon us as he faces off with long-time American rival Alex Wassabi in a battle of UK vs USA at the OVO Arena Wembley this evening.
The Brit has dropped the training team that brought him to consecutive losses against Jake Paul and Vinnie Hacker, and in the process has dropped 35lb.
Meanwhile, Wassabi is looking to prove a point after years of trying to establish himself in the YouTube boxing scene and an intensive professional training camp.
In the co-main event, London's own King Kenny faces the leader of the world famous Faze Clan Thomas 'Temperrr' Oliveira in what is expected to be one of the more technical showcases in YouTube boxing.
The fights will be streamed live by Showstar Boxing, but you can follow the action right here...

     Deji shows off impressive body transformation as he comes in over a STONE lighter for Alex Wassabi fight than he did against Vinnie Hacker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Deji has come in over a stone lighter for his fight with Alex Wassabi than he did for his last bout against Vinnie Hacker.
The YouTuber is currently 0-2 in white collar boxing matches, having previously been stopped by Jake Paul and Hacker.
Last time out especially, Deji sparked concerns with his physique at the weigh-in as he came in at 183lbs (83kg).
Now though, he’s dropped over a stone and weighed in at 168.7lbs (76.5kg) ahead of his fight with Wassabi.
Deji told the Mirror: “When I weighed in at 183lb [vs Hacker], I refuelled and got up to around 205lb – that wasn’t ideal.

     THE undercard for YouTube sensations Deji vs Alex Wassabi is UNDER WAY.
The grudge match is being played out at Ovo Wembley Arena in front of a sell-out crowd.
Deji has not stepped foot in the ring since last summer when Vinnie Hacker secured a three-round TKO victory against the 25-year-old.
On the undercard, Ryan Taylor was disqualified for a disgraceful headbutt on his opponent DK Money.
The bizarre scenes were even then REPEATED as Vitaly was headbutted by Kristen Hanby.
