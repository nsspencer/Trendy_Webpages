     (Photo by John Parra/Getty Images)One rowdy individual decided he needed a few minutes of fame as he ended up hopping into the ring during the Deji vs. Alex Wassabi fight.
As Deji and Alex Wassabi were minding their own business and trying to punch each other, one rowdy boxing fan decided to get the spotlight on him.
The individual decided to make his way into the ring, joining Deji and Wassabi.
While he was running through the ring screaming something about TikTok, the boxing fan was scooped up, hit in the head, and then subsequently hurled out of the ring.

     Deji vs Alex Wassabi: Footage of 'illegal elbow' emerges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The latest event saw Deji, the brother of KSI, and debutant Alex Wassabi go toe-to-toe in the ring which saw the Londoner lose his third fight in succession.
Wassabi replied well and forced his more experienced counterpart to clinch, causing Deji to miss at the end of the round.
It is glaringly obvious that Alex Wassabi used an elbow during the fight which would have seen a point deduction and led to the fight ending in a draw.
Some Alex Wassabi fans have claimed that the strike was an accident, but it does look as though he lead with his elbow with intent to landing a clean connection to stun Deji.

     Deji vs Alex Wassabi LIVE REACTION: Wassabi WINS on split decision as spectator invades ring during main event
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ALEX WASSABI has BEATEN Deji in the showdown of the YouTubers.
A spectator has jumped into the ring during the second round and attempted to hit Wassabi but was pushed out of the ring.
Local boy Deji was left dejected when only one judge gave a decision in his favour, while the other two judges went with American Wassabi.
Anthony Joshua and brother KSI were in the crowd cheering him on but ultimately Deji, 25, couldn't get the job done.
On the undercard, Ryan Taylor was disqualified for a disgraceful headbutt on his opponent DK Money.

     Deji shows off impressive body transformation as he comes in over a STONE lighter for Alex Wassabi fight than he did against Vinnie Hacker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Deji has come in over a stone lighter for his fight with Alex Wassabi than he did for his last bout against Vinnie Hacker.
The YouTuber is currently 0-2 in white collar boxing matches, having previously been stopped by Jake Paul and Hacker.
Last time out especially, Deji sparked concerns with his physique at the weigh-in as he came in at 183lbs (83kg).
Now though, he’s dropped over a stone and weighed in at 168.7lbs (76.5kg) ahead of his fight with Wassabi.
Deji told the Mirror: “When I weighed in at 183lb [vs Hacker], I refuelled and got up to around 205lb – that wasn’t ideal.
