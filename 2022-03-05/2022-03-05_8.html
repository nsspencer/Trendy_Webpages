     Grayson Allen on Bulls fans’ boos: ‘I’ve had way worse in college’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When Grayson Allen checked into the game against the Bulls on Friday, he was not expecting the warmest welcome to the Windy City.
And, well, Chicago fans booed by the Bucks guard.
“That was weak, I’ve had way worse in college,” Allen said of Bulls fans booing him during the game.
Allen experienced his fair share of boos and fans reaction of him during his years of playing for Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski.
Allen was probably not worried about the boos from the fans in Chicago, as he's experienced similar treatment quite a bit throughout his career.

     Grayson Allen has funny response to Bulls fans’ booingGrayson Allen is used to negative attention, and he certainly would have seen the reaction he received from Chicago Bulls fans on Friday coming.
In fact, the Milwaukee Bucks guard was actually quite unimpressed with what he was subjected to.
Allen was the target of Bulls fans’ ire on Friday as the Bucks visited Chicago.
Allen was booed pretty much every time he touched the ball Friday, and Bulls fans let him have it as much as they could.

     Column: Chicago Bulls fans boo Milwaukee Bucks villain Grayson Allen while players mostly tune out the noise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Allen didn’t even attempt a shot in the first quarter and missed his only shot attempt in the second.
He passed the ball away so quickly on one possession it was in a teammate’s hands by the time the crowd began to boo.
Allen sat for an extended stretch before returning with 6:06 left in the half, and it looked like a potential reboot of the Caruso play was possible with 1:47 left in the half.
Allen chased down Javonte Green as Green went in for a dunk but slowed down and didn’t contest it.

     Bulls' Derrick Jones Jr. Denies Foul on Bucks' Grayson Allen Was Intentional
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AP Photo/David ZalubowskiChicago Bulls forward Derrick Jones Jr. said his flagrant foul against the Milwaukee Bucks' Grayson Allen on Friday night was not an attempt at payback for Allen's hard foul against Alex Caruso in January.
Jones explained his only mindset on the fourth-quarter play was "get a stop" and he didn't believe the foul warranted being elevated to a flagrant.
Jones said he never goes on the court looking to take out an opponent, regardless of the circumstances.
"If I get a foul in the process of trying to get a stop, then so be it.
The Bucks and Bulls are next scheduled to face off March 22.

     Grayson Allen’s message on Chicago boos will piss off Bulls fans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Grayson Allen is not a beloved figure in the city of Chicago.
Ever since Grayson Allen decked beloved Bulls veteran Alex Caruso, which forced him to miss several weeks and counting with a wrist injury, he’s become public enemy number one for their fanbase.
Grayson Allen asked about the crowd in post-game interview: “That was weak, I’ve had way worse in college,” said the Bucks guard on Chicago’s smattering of boos.
Johnson:“I don’t think it was a flagrant,” said the Bulls veteran.
It’s basketball.”Where Grayson Allen goes, a mix of boos and questionable fouls seem to always follow.

     Bulls get 'revenge' on Grayson Allen, but lose fourth straight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Whether it was on purpose or, as Derrick Jones Jr. insists, by accident, the Bulls have finally (sort of) gotten their payback on Grayson Allen.
In a late January matchup between the Bucks and the Bulls, Allen had a flagrant 2 foul that put Bulls point guard Alex Caruso out of commission for months with a broken wrist.
Last night, in a close game that Chicago ended up dropping, 118-112, Jones Jr. hit Allen in the head with his elbow and hip-checked the former Duke star while defending a layup attempt.
Jones Jr. was handed a flagrant 1, and while many Bulls fans delighted in the payback foul, the Bulls forward insisted that the elbow hit had been accidental.
“I want to get a stop as much as they want to get a stop on the other end,” Jones Jr. said.

     Get a stop.That’s all Derrick Jones Jr. said he was thinking when he saw Bucks guard Grayson Allen driving the baseline looking to finish a layup.“That’s all that goes through my head,” Jones said.
Caruso underwent surgery and still hasn’t rejoined the lineup.
He watched the Bucks take a 118-112 victory from the bench in street clothes.
Allen was suspended for one game.
That’s what Bulls basketball is about.
