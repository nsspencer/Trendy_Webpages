     SNL: Oscar Isaac &amp; Charli XCX Offer "Cool Aidy" Bryant Some Tough LoveJust when we thought we had some sense of how the world worked, Moon Knight star Oscar Isaac, musical guest Charli XCX, NBC's Saturday Night Live star Aidy Bryant have gone and thrown our world into turmoil.
Thursdays mean we get on-stage promos from the host, musical guest, and an SNL cast member.
And then Friday and Saturday are "free-for-all" days (unless the host did Thursday night late-night shows then there's content on Friday).
That's just how the SNL promo cycle worked (and why we covered Better Call Saul star Bob Odenkirk discussing the late Chris Farley earlier today).
So I'm going to do everything I can to see it carry on and carry on well," he continued.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The award-winning actor, best known for his dramatic roles, returned to Studio 8H this week to host Saturday Night Live.
The episode, which features musical guest Charli XCX, marks Isaac’s SNL hosting debut, though he made a cameo on the sketch series back in October.
During Isaac’s monologue, he talked about his full circle moment.
“Arguably better than the real Avengers.”Isaac is in full promotional mode for Moon Knight, a Marvel miniseries that will premiere on Disney+ on March 30.
The actor spoke about the series in a 2021 interview with Variety, claiming Moon Knight was one of his most challenging roles to date.
