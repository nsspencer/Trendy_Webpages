LSU nearly pulled off the upset but missed a shot at the rim as time expired to lose 77-76.
The loss was the Tigers third in the last four games and has dropped them under .500 at 8-9 in the SEC.
LSU still seems to be safely in the tournament field but can't afford to lose to Alabama and then have a quick exit in the SEC Tournament.

     What Nate Oats said about Alabama basketball's shot-clock violation in final seconds of overtime vs. LSU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After four consecutive points scored by Tari Eason, the Crimson Tide got the ball back trailing by one in overtime.
The Crimson Tide squandered the opportunity.
The problem is, JD Davison didn't seem to know the Crimson Tide only had that much time left.
"One of my assistants said they had eye contact with both players involved, (Jahvon Quinerly) and (Davison) and let them know," Alabama basketball coach Nate Oats said.
If the Crimson Tide would have defeated the Tigers (21-10, 9-9 SEC), Alabama would have secured the No.

     Alabama shot 37% from the floor and hoisted up 40 threes, while only hitting 11, in the losing effort.
LSU shot 46% on field goals, including 35% from beyond the arc.
These three Crimson Tide stars shined despite the loss and contributed their best efforts for Nate Oats.
