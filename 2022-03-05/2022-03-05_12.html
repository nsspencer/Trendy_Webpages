     Charlotte FC breaks MLS attendance record in home opener
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Charlotte FC crowd comes out in full force, with 74,300 in attendance for the club's MLS debut.
(0:49)Charlotte FC has broken the MLS attendance record, after a crowd of 74,479 was announced at Bank of America Stadium for their first-ever home game against the visiting LA Galaxy on Saturday.
That number beat the previous MLS record of 73,019, set by Atlanta United when they hosted the 2018 MLS Cup at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

As well as setting the single-game attendance record, the club has targeted an average attendance in their debut season of 30,000 as well as hosting a home playoff game later in the year.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For just about everyone outside of the LA Galaxy ’s camp, Saturday night’s deadlock at Bank of America Stadium would have ideally been broken by a Charlotte FC goal.
That would have produced a euphoric moment where anticipation among the league-record standalone crowd of 74,749 fans erupted into rapturous celebrations.
“I walked around the city today for just a couple blocks outside the hotel to grab a coffee around 2:30, 3:00 and it was buzzing.
As much as LA cherished the result, they also showered praise on the environment they encountered in the Queen City.
Alvarez had subbed on in the 70th minute, his long-range blast giving LA two wins to start the 2022 campaign.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Charlotte FC made a record-breaking home debut Saturday night, setting a Major League Soccer attendance mark of 74,479 in a 1-0 loss to the LA Galaxy.
“Welcome to the largest party Charlotte has known,” Charlotte FC and Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper said to the crowd moments before kickoff.
Even the signature Panthers statues outside the stadium had Charlotte FC scarves draped around their necks for the occasion.
“We've waited for this for a while,” said Lenny Romero, a Charlotte fan who wore a curly wig of Charlotte FC blue.
Still, it would give Charlotte FC a capacity of about 38,000.

     As Charlotte FC’s players made their way onto the field for the historic inaugural home match, the lights dropped, and 74,479 roared in unison.
CHARLOTTE—It was a historic night, the likes of which Bank of America Stadium has never seen before.
In December 2019, when the Queen City was awarded its Major League Soccer franchise, owner David Tepper asked fans a question: Are you ready to party?
With a crowd that shattered MLS attendance records—and represented the largest attendance of any match in the world over the weekend—the stadium was bouncing.
LA Galaxy fan Sandra Cervantes was among those who earned air miles en route to Bank of America Stadium.
