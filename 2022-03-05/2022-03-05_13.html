LSU nearly pulled off the upset but missed a shot at the rim as time expired to lose 77-76.
The loss was the Tigers third in the last four games and has dropped them under .500 at 8-9 in the SEC.
LSU still seems to be safely in the tournament field but can't afford to lose to Alabama and then have a quick exit in the SEC Tournament.

     Alabama Basketball: LSU loss shows same Tide problems
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Saturday in Baton Rouge was an unsurprising disappointment for Alabama Basketball.
The result on Saturday was 21 Crimson Tide turnovers and 23 LSU points off turnovers.
In addition to the turnover problem, the Crimson Tide shot just 38% from the floor and only 27.5% from outside the arc.
Such mistakes make it hard for Alabama basketball fans to disagree with opinions like the one in the tweet below.
The now 19-12 Crimson Tide will not lose much in NCAA seeding from the LSU loss.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jusaun Holt’s status with Alabama basketball is unclear after the freshman guard did not travel to Baton Rogue, La., with the team this weekend.
“Me and him are going to meet this weekend and figure out his status on the team moving forward,” Oats said.
“It’s an internal issue, team issue.”Holt was active on social media during Alabama's loss to LSU, posting a video on his TikTok account.
Holt posted a plus-22 during that game, drawing praise from Oats who said the freshman might deserve more minutes moving forward.
“He gave us some quality minutes," Oats said following that game.

     What Nate Oats said about Alabama basketball's shot-clock violation in final seconds of overtime vs. LSU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After four consecutive points scored by Tari Eason, the Crimson Tide got the ball back trailing by one in overtime.
The Crimson Tide squandered the opportunity.
The problem is, JD Davison didn't seem to know the Crimson Tide only had that much time left.
"One of my assistants said they had eye contact with both players involved, (Jahvon Quinerly) and (Davison) and let them know," Alabama basketball coach Nate Oats said.
If the Crimson Tide would have defeated the Tigers (21-10, 9-9 SEC), Alabama would have secured the No.

     Alabama's football and basketball coach duo rank as No. 1

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Crimson Tide’s football team, led by the greatest college football coach of all time in Nick Saban, is rich in tradition both past and present.
However, the run that Saban has his football team on presently, either contending for or outright winning the national crown, is unprecedented.
Alabama football has played in six of the last seven College Football Playoff Championships dating back to 2015, the second year of the event’s existence.
Overall, the Crimson Tide boasts a record of 10-4 in the playoff.
Stay tuned to Roll Tide Wire for continued coverage of the Crimson Tide.
