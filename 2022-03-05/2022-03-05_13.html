     It was not clear what the convoy’s exact travel plans were.
There were reports on Saturday of at least a thousand trucks, recreational vehicles and cars gathered at the racetrack.
One man who described himself as the lead trucker in the group told the crowd on Friday night that he would be driving his truck into the heart of the capital.
“D.C., the government, whomever, can claim that they have all this opposition for us waiting in D.C.,” the man said, according to Reuters.
“But that flag on the back of my truck will go down to Constitution Avenue between the White House and the Washington Monument.”

     Truck convoy protesting vaccine mandates travels through South Carolina on way to D.C.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A truck caravan made its way through South Carolina on Interstate 85 Saturday as truck drivers head to Washington D.C. to protest COVID-19 mandates.
Convoys of truck protests across the country were inspired by truckers and others protesting coronavirus restrictions and other issues in the Canadian capital of Ottawa.
Dan Harvell, former chairman of the Anderson County Republican Party, helped organize the caravan along with the Anderson County Republican Party.
Besides protesting vaccine mandates, the caravan highlights an appreciation for truckers of America and what they endure to transport needed items, he said.
"All along the route, these truck drivers are going to see multiple thousands of people during the day, cheering them on," Harvell said.

     Truck Convoy Gathers in Hagerstown With Plans to Protest in DC Area
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A long line of 18-wheelers surrounded by supporters on foot was spotted in Hagerstown, Maryland, on Saturday morning, as the Washington, D.C., area braced for protests that could disrupt traffic.
The group initially planned to drive onto the Capital Beltway on Saturday, but a spokesperson told News4 that they'll stay in Hagerstown until Sunday morning.
A long line of trucks prepares to make its way into the D.C. region to protest mask and vaccine mandates.
On Saturday morning, Chopper4 video captured trucks and other vehicles stretching about three miles toward Interstate 81 in the Hagerstown area.
Federal and local law enforcement have repeatedly said they are aware truck convoys plan to visit the area, and those agencies are prepared.

     Trucker convoys continue trek toward Washington, D.C., to protest government mandates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A nationwide group of truckers is planning to converge on the Washington, D.C.-area this weekend to protest pandemic-related government mandates.
Another group, the “American Freedom Convoy,” mostly from the Midwest, is also headed to Washington, arriving around Monday.
It is unclear how many people or trucks will be participating in the convoys or where they will end up.
Hundreds of trucks and other vehicles had gathered at the Hagerstown Speedway in Washington County on Thursday evening, including trucks from New England, according to the Hagerstown Herald-Mail.
(Jake May | MLive.com, file)In New Jersey, truck convoy organizers say they are not planning a formal trek to Washington.

     Anti-Covid controls protest convoy gathers on outskirts of Washington DC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The so-called “People’s Convoy”, which originated in California and has drawn participants from around the country, is calling for an end to all pandemic-related restrictions.
A website for the protest said they did not plan to enter “DC proper” and social media posts suggested they could remain at the racetrack on Saturday.
“DC, the government, whomever, can claim that they have all this opposition for us waiting in DC,” the man said.
A 26 February US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) bulletin to law enforcement reviewed by Reuters said trucker convoys could hinder emergency responders depending on the size of the protest.
Federal law enforcement was also cognizant of the need to respect the right to peaceful protest, the official said.

     Roughly 1,000 vehicles arriving from all directions converged on Hagerstown Speedway, clogging traffic, the Washington Post reported.
Some truckers participating in the “People’s Convoy” said they planned to head to the DC Beltway area Saturday, but others said they were awaiting instructions.
As a precaution, the National Guard has been called to help with DC-area traffic control through at least Monday, WUSA-9 reported.
