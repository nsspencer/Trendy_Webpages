     Cam Johnson gets real on beef with Julius Randle after career-high night in Suns win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With Chris Paul and Devin Booker both sidelined, the Phoenix Suns need players to step up and keep the team rolling.
Earlier in the game, Randle knocked the wind out of Johnson on an aggressive move that wasn‚Äôt called a foul.
After the game, Johnson explained his thought process as he and Randle got into it.
And I just wanted to win the game for my team, for CP and Book who are out right now."
Having him surround Mikal Bridges and Deandre Ayton while Paul and Booker are out will be huge for the Suns.

     Phoenix Suns‚Äô forward, Cameron Johnson, is a cold-blooded killer with ice in his veins!
In last night‚Äôs nail-biting 115-114 victory over the Knicks, Johnson was electric ‚Äì finishing with a career-high 38 points.
A game winner that Johnson later referred to as the ‚Äúbiggest shot‚Äù of his career thus far.
Everyone except Phoenix Suns head coach Monty Williams, of course.

     PHOENIX ‚Äî New York's Julius Randle yelled at Phoenix's Cam Johnson, bumped chests with him and then shoved him again for good measure.
The NBA-leading Suns, playing without All-Star guards Chris Paul and Devin Booker, improved to 51-12.
Randle and Johnson were called for technicals after bumping chests and exchanging words.
A referee separated the two, but then Randle barreled through the ref to shove Johnson again, which earned the ejection.
Randle scored 25 points, and Robinson added 17 points and 15 rebounds.

     Knicks built up a nice double-digit lead by this point with Julius Randle leading the way at 24 points on 18 shots in 28 minutes.
Johnson at this point was having a decent night by his standards: 14 points through almost three quarters.
But for the under-15 minutes that remained, Johnson turned things up a few notches.
In total, Johnson‚Äôs career-high 38 came on just 16 shots and in just 28 minutes, including nine three-pointers tying the franchise record.
Mikal Bridges ‚Äî who was the first to check on Johnson after the initial hard blow to the chest in the first quarter ‚Äî finished with 20 points on just 11 shots.

     Cam Johnson's angry shooting stroke leads Suns' win for career-high 38
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Johnson shattered his previous career high of 24 points with 38 on Friday night in a 115-114 win over the New York Knicks that ended on Johnson‚Äôs buzzer-beating 3.
Here is Al McCoy calling Cam Johnson's buzzer-beater 3 to walk it off for the Suns!
Through one half of fairly even basketball, it felt like the Suns were on track to eventually pull away.
New York was overselling its defense to dribble penetration, leaving Suns point guard Cam Payne and his team to have a field day kicking the ball out to open shooters.
Without it, New York‚Äôs offense crumbled, all while the Suns fed off what Crowder described as a fight in Johnson‚Äôs eyes.

     'So hot': Suns forward Cam Johnson cooked Knicks with career night after skirmish with Julius Randle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     I can honestly say that‚Äôs the first time that‚Äôs ever happened that he‚Äôs had energy that‚Äôs contagious in that way.
Very emotional moment.‚ÄùDuring the Thanksgiving holiday season, the Knicks power forward gave Johnson a thump in Madison Square Garden ‚Äì and no foul was called.
‚ÄúI went to box him out, just playing basketball and he hit the heck out of me,‚Äù Johnson said.
Johnson pushed Randle in the back, the two met face to face and Randle responded by pushing him with his left hand in front of the Suns bench.
‚ÄúI told our guys after the interaction that happened, I said, ‚ÄòOK, we‚Äôre going to win this game,‚Äô‚Äù Williams said.
