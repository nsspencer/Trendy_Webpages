     Mitchell Ryan, Who Played the Villain in ‘Lethal Weapon,’ Dies at 88
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mitchell Ryan, an actor known for his role in the gothic soap opera “Dark Shadows” and who played a heroin-dealing retired general in the action movie “Lethal Weapon,” died at his home in Los Angeles on Friday.
The cause was heart failure, Ro Diamond, who represented Mr. Ryan for more than 40 years, said on Saturday.
With his square jawline and slicked-back hair, Mr. Ryan entertained moviegoers and television fans in a career that spanned more than 50 years, beginning with an uncredited part in the movie “Thunder Road” (1958).
His breakout performance came in 1966 when he landed a role in “Dark Shadows,” a popular soap opera about the adventurous lives of the affluent Collins family.
Set in the fictional town of Collinsport, Maine, the family experiences supernatural events and are tormented by strange beings, such as ghosts, witches and zombies.

     Lethal Weapon Actor Mitchell Ryan Has Passed Away
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     By Nathan Kamal | 3 seconds agoOne of the stars of the original Lethal Weapon has passed away.
Mitchell Ryan’s career began all the way back in the 1960s, when he began acting in the theater after his service in the Korean War.
Lethal Weapon was perhaps Mitchell Ryan’s most well-known role, in large part because of the sheer longevity of the action franchise.
In many ways, Mitchell Ryan was a consummate character actor, who could play many variations on similar characters while still remaining recognizably himself.
RIP Mitchell Ryan.

     'Dark Shadows,' 'Lethal Weapon' actor Mitchell Ryan dies at 88
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LOS ANGELES — Mitchell Ryan, who played a villainous general in the first "Lethal Weapon" movie, a ruthless businessman on TV's "Santa Barbara" and had character roles on the soap opera "Dark Shadows" and the 1990s sitcom "Dharma &amp; Greg," died Friday.
Rugged, granite-jawed and sporting a sleek mane of hair, Ryan was instantly recognizable on TV and the big screen.
He was a general-turned heroin smuggler in "Lethal Weapon," police officer in "Magnum Force" and "Electra Glide in Blue," and the conniving, murderous Las Vegas businessman Anthony Tonell in the nighttime TV soap opera "Santa Barbara."
Ryan played Burke Devlin on the cult 1960s soap opera "Dark Shadows" for one season but he was fired because of his alcoholism.
"He was a great gift in my life," Kathryn Leigh Scott, who appeared with him in "Dark Shadows," said in a Facebook post.
