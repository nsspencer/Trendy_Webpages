     Warriors takeaways: LeBron James scores 56 to drop Golden State to third in West
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     King of LA: The Lakers started LeBron James at center Saturday against the Warriors and he was absolutely dominant.
Bench shines in second quarter: Warriors head coach Steve Kerr expressed his concerns about the lack of cohesion in team’s second unit in recent weeks.
Golden State still surrendered 30 points in the second quarter, but made up the difference by scoring 42.
There was a stretch in the second quarter where the Warriors were plus-14 with Stephen Curry on the bench.
After playing the entire first quarter, he played just five minutes in the second, as the Warriors’ bench outscored the Lakers’ bench 36-9.

     Yager scores game-winner in final minute as Moose Jaw overcomes pair of two-goal deficits, take 6-5 win at Mosaic PlaceThroughout their recent run of Western Hockey League success, the Moose Jaw Warriors haven’t had to make a lot of in-game comebacks.
The Warriors twice overcame two-goal deficits and Brayden Yager would eventually score the game-winner with 37 seconds remaining as Moose Jaw picked up a 6-5 victory over the Brandon Wheat Kings.
The Warriors improved to 31-19-3-2 with the win and continue to hold down fourth place in the Eastern Conference, eight points back of Red Deer and three points up on Saskatoon.
“I think that was a really important one for our group,” said Warriors head coach Mark O’Leary.
Landon Roberts and Ridly Greig scored for Brandon 1:40 apart midway through the second, but the Warriors would get both of those back before the period was out.
