     Maxey finished the night with a team-leading 33 points ‚Äî 24 of which came in the second half.
Still, his strong performance didn't keep him ‚Äî or Joel Embiid ‚Äî from getting clowned by superstar trade deadline acquisition James Harden.
Harden tweeted "when your lil bro finally beat you in 21" after the game, posting a photo of Maxey gleefully peering into the eyes of a seemingly dejected Embiid.

     While Harden‚Äôs 25 points and 11 assists will grab headlines and Joel Embiid‚Äôs 22 points and nine rebounds solidify his top spot in the MVP conversation, Tyrese Maxey was the star in the Sixers‚Äô come from behind 125-119 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers Friday night.
The second-year guard ran roughshod over the Cavaliers‚Äô defense in the second half, scoring 14 points in the third quarter to erase Cleveland‚Äôs early 21 point lead late.
Tyrese Maxey is HIM.
Despite the new ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù talk in Philadelphia, Maxey doesn‚Äôt see it that way.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we look at it as Big 3, Big 2,‚Äù Maxey said per ESPN.

     James Harden Jokes Around After Tyrese Maxey Outscored Joel Embiid In A Win vs. Cavaliers: "When Your Lil Bro Finally Beat You In 21."
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There were videos of him teaching Joel Embiid his signature step-back during one of their first practice sessions together and the feeling around the franchise has improved drastically since the Beard landed in Philly.
A major plus point during this season for the Sixers is the emergence of Tyrese Maxey, who seems to be developing into a star in the league.
This led to Harden deciding to have a bit of fun at Embiid's expense, tweeting a picture of Embiid and Maxey and suggesting that Tyrese scoring more is like when your little brother beats you at a game.
"when your lil bro finally beat you in 21 üòÇ"Maxey had 33 points in the game, a whole 11 more than Embiid.
This isn't likely to bother the big man too much, Joel is among the frontrunners for the MVP this season.

     James Harden Praises Tyrese Maxey for Rallying Sixers vs. Cavaliers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As they hosted the Cleveland Cavaliers, who were out for revenge, the Sixers were outscored 43-30 in the first quarter of action.
While they battled back in the second quarter to keep the game within comeback distance, the 76ers still trailed 71-63 by halftime.
Earlier this week, the Sixers received a second-half boost from their second-year guard Tyrese Maxey as he rattled off 21 points in the second half to lead his team to victory.
On Friday night, the young standout had a similar showing in the second half of the matchup against the Cavs.
"Any given night, it can be any of us to go off," said Sixers guard James Harden.

     Philadelphia 76ers: Is Tyrese Maxey to key to a deep playoff run?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Could Tyrese Maxey be the key for a deep playoff run for the Philadelphia 76ers?
In four games with the Sixers, Harden is averaging 27 points, eight rebounds, and 12 assists per game.
Specifically, I think it‚Äôs only fair to consider that Tyrese Maxey may be the key to a long playoff run for the Sixers.
In a playoff series, the Sixers are going to need a third consistent player to rise if they‚Äôre going to make a deep playoff run.
Maxey is a rising star in the league and could get his moment in the postseason if he helps the Sixers make a deep playoff run and possibly get to the NBA Finals.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA‚ÄìThe play of young Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey has continued to impress the rest of the NBA.
In four games playing with new star guard James Harden, Maxey is averaging 26.8 points while shooting 64.9% from the floor and 70% from deep on 5.0 attempts per game.
Before the Sixers took on the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff was highly impressed by Maxey and his play.
When the Sixers need a bucket and the two superstars are bottled up, then Maxey comes in with the big shot or the big play.
‚ÄúHe knows that he has a job to do in order to help this team be successful.‚ÄùThis post originally appeared on Sixers Wire!

     Tyrese Maxey fuels another second-half Sixers comeback in win over Cavaliers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Sixers played one of their worst defensive halves in a long time Friday night at home against Cleveland.
Harden has spoken a lot about building the right habits since arriving in Philadelphia, but this was not it.The Sixers struggled a bit initially against the Cavs‚Äô 3-2 zone, which is admittedly a tough puzzle to solve with three 7-footers on the floor.
But their transition defense was a disaster.
Matisse Thybulle had no answer for Darius Garland , who is a terrific player in the pick-and-roll.
