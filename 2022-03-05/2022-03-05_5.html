     Record daily snowfall continues for Anchorage with significant accumulations

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - As of 4 p.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service office at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport measured 10.5 inches of snow, smashing the old record on this day of 4.4 inches set in 2009.
The March 5 record had already been eclipsed by noon Saturday, when the weather service reported 7.8 inches at the airport.
Saturday’s record was also enough for a top-20 placement in the all-time record books.
The 10.5 inches makes it the 18th-biggest snowfall at the airport since official record-keeping began in the early 1950s.
At 10:15 a.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service upgraded the winter weather advisory to a winter storm warning which remains in effect until 1 a.m. Sunday.

     Storm now expected to drop up to a foot of snow in Anchorage Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (Anne Raup / ADN)A storm moving through Southcentral Alaska is now expected to drop up to a foot of snow in the Anchorage area, with snowfall likely to pick up into late afternoon.
An intensifying storm system just south of the Kenai Peninsula caused National Weather Service forecasters to upgrade a winter weather advisory to a winter storm warning in effect until 1 a.m. Sunday, with total snowfall accumulation from 6 to 12 inches.
“Lighter snow accumulation will continue through the early afternoon before increasing once again in intensity by late afternoon,” Fazal said.
Fazal said conditions were expected to improve by Sunday morning with clear skies and temperatures in the low 30s.
Saturday temperatures in the low 30s will drop overnight to lows in the teens, Fazal said.
