     James Harden pokes fun at Tyrese Maxey, Joel Embiid after win over Cavaliers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Maxey finished the night with a team-leading 33 points — 24 of which came in the second half.
Still, his strong performance didn't keep him — or Joel Embiid — from getting clowned by superstar trade deadline acquisition James Harden.
Harden tweeted "when your lil bro finally beat you in 21" after the game, posting a photo of Maxey gleefully peering into the eyes of a seemingly dejected Embiid.
when your lil bro finally beat you in 21 ð pic.twitter.com/iF8MjcWUao — James Harden (@JHarden13) March 5, 2022Absolutely brilliant.
They've still yet to be beaten with James Harden in the lineup.

     NBA prop bet: Riding Tyrese Maxey's hot streak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While Harden and Joel Embiid get the recognition from many, guard Tyrese Maxey has taken his game to the next level playing alongside Harden in the backcourt.
His prop line is currently at 17.5 points, a number he's gone over in five straight games.
Last night, Maxey went off for 33 against Cleveland, going 5 for 6 from three-point land.
It's hard to ignore this recent surge from the young Sixers guard, and in a big game, I like the hot streak to continue.
Best Bet: Tyrese Maxey over 17.5 points (-115 FD)

     Tyrese Maxey Becomes Philly's Scoring Star In 76ers Win Over Cleveland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While Harden’s 25 points and 11 assists will grab headlines and Joel Embiid’s 22 points and nine rebounds solidify his top spot in the MVP conversation, Tyrese Maxey was the star in the Sixers’ come from behind 125-119 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers Friday night.
The second-year guard ran roughshod over the Cavaliers’ defense in the second half, scoring 14 points in the third quarter to erase Cleveland’s early 21 point lead late.
Tyrese Maxey is HIM.
Despite the new “Big 3” talk in Philadelphia, Maxey doesn’t see it that way.
“I don’t think we look at it as Big 3, Big 2,” Maxey said per ESPN.

     As they hosted the Cleveland Cavaliers, who were out for revenge, the Sixers were outscored 43-30 in the first quarter of action.
While they battled back in the second quarter to keep the game within comeback distance, the 76ers still trailed 71-63 by halftime.
Earlier this week, the Sixers received a second-half boost from their second-year guard Tyrese Maxey as he rattled off 21 points in the second half to lead his team to victory.
On Friday night, the young standout had a similar showing in the second half of the matchup against the Cavs.
"Any given night, it can be any of us to go off," said Sixers guard James Harden.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA–The play of young Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey has continued to impress the rest of the NBA.
In four games playing with new star guard James Harden, Maxey is averaging 26.8 points while shooting 64.9% from the floor and 70% from deep on 5.0 attempts per game.
Before the Sixers took on the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff was highly impressed by Maxey and his play.
When the Sixers need a bucket and the two superstars are bottled up, then Maxey comes in with the big shot or the big play.
“He knows that he has a job to do in order to help this team be successful.”This post originally appeared on Sixers Wire!

     Philadelphia 76ers: Is Tyrese Maxey to key to a deep playoff run?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Could Tyrese Maxey be the key for a deep playoff run for the Philadelphia 76ers?
In four games with the Sixers, Harden is averaging 27 points, eight rebounds, and 12 assists per game.
Specifically, I think it’s only fair to consider that Tyrese Maxey may be the key to a long playoff run for the Sixers.
In a playoff series, the Sixers are going to need a third consistent player to rise if they’re going to make a deep playoff run.
Maxey is a rising star in the league and could get his moment in the postseason if he helps the Sixers make a deep playoff run and possibly get to the NBA Finals.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Sixers played one of their worst defensive halves in a long time Friday night at home against Cleveland.
Harden has spoken a lot about building the right habits since arriving in Philadelphia, but this was not it.The Sixers struggled a bit initially against the Cavs’ 3-2 zone, which is admittedly a tough puzzle to solve with three 7-footers on the floor.
But their transition defense was a disaster.
Matisse Thybulle had no answer for Darius Garland , who is a terrific player in the pick-and-roll.
Tyrese Maxey was bullied by a stronger player in Isaac Okoro
