     Cam Johnson gets real on beef with Julius Randle after career-high night in Suns win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With Chris Paul and Devin Booker both sidelined, the Phoenix Suns need players to step up and keep the team rolling.
Earlier in the game, Randle knocked the wind out of Johnson on an aggressive move that wasn‚Äôt called a foul.
After the game, Johnson explained his thought process as he and Randle got into it.
And I just wanted to win the game for my team, for CP and Book who are out right now."
Having him surround Mikal Bridges and Deandre Ayton while Paul and Booker are out will be huge for the Suns.

     Cam Johnson stepped up Friday night vs. the New York Knicks with Devin Booker sidelined due to the health-and-safety protocols.
In the third quarter, the 26-year old got into an altercation with Julius Randle, which resulted in an ejection for the Knicks star.
Johnson responded with a career-high 38 points, nine three-pointers, and the game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer to beat New York 114-115.
Here‚Äôs how NBA fans and Knicks fans reacted to Johnson‚Äôs performance on Twitter.

A game winner that Johnson later referred to as the ‚Äúbiggest shot‚Äù of his career thus far.
Everyone except Phoenix Suns head coach Monty Williams, of course.

     5 takeaways from Suns' stunner over Knicks on Cam Johnson buzzer-beating bank 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cam Johnson thought he should've kept the ball when Phoenix tried to force overtime against Utah last week.
Scoring 21 of his 38 points in the fourth, Johnson nearly matched his previous career high of 24 in the final quarter.
The Knicks were up, 86-76, with 2:40 left in the third, but Suns coach Monty Williams said he told his Suns they were going to win the game.
Then Johnson went solar.
Burks left the door open for Johnson to make the 31-footer at the horn that had the crowd going bonkers.

     PHOENIX ‚Äî New York's Julius Randle yelled at Phoenix's Cam Johnson, bumped chests with him and then shoved him again for good measure.
The NBA-leading Suns, playing without All-Star guards Chris Paul and Devin Booker, improved to 51-12.
Randle and Johnson were called for technicals after bumping chests and exchanging words.
A referee separated the two, but then Randle barreled through the ref to shove Johnson again, which earned the ejection.
Randle scored 25 points, and Robinson added 17 points and 15 rebounds.

     Cam Johnson's angry shooting stroke leads Suns' win for career-high 38
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Johnson shattered his previous career high of 24 points with 38 on Friday night in a 115-114 win over the New York Knicks that ended on Johnson‚Äôs buzzer-beating 3.
Here is Al McCoy calling Cam Johnson's buzzer-beater 3 to walk it off for the Suns!
Through one half of fairly even basketball, it felt like the Suns were on track to eventually pull away.
New York was overselling its defense to dribble penetration, leaving Suns point guard Cam Payne and his team to have a field day kicking the ball out to open shooters.
Without it, New York‚Äôs offense crumbled, all while the Suns fed off what Crowder described as a fight in Johnson‚Äôs eyes.
