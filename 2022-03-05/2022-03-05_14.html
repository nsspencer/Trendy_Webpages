     Michael Wilbon calls Grayson Allen a ‘thug’One prominent ESPN personality is making his feelings about Grayson Allen very clear.
Before the Milwaukee Bucks-Chicago Bulls game on Friday, ESPN analyst Michael Wilbon had some harsh words for the Bucks guard Allen.
Speaking in reference to the incident where Allen injured Bulls guard Alex Caruso the last time the two teams played (video here), Wilbon called Allen a “thug.”“You take a guy out like that?
Grayson Allen is a thug,” said Wilbon.

     Grayson Allen on Bulls fans’ boos: ‘I’ve had way worse in college’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When Grayson Allen checked into the game against the Bulls on Friday, he was not expecting the warmest welcome to the Windy City.
And, well, Chicago fans booed by the Bucks guard.
“That was weak, I’ve had way worse in college,” Allen said of Bulls fans booing him during the game.
Allen experienced his fair share of boos and fans reaction of him during his years of playing for Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski.
Allen was probably not worried about the boos from the fans in Chicago, as he's experienced similar treatment quite a bit throughout his career.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Milwaukee Bucks guard Grayson Allen was the victim of a hard foul from Derrick Jones Jr. of the Chicago Bulls, hit in the head by Jones while trying to pass the ball.
Jones received a Flagrant 1 foul for the incident.
“That’s all that goes through my head,” Jones said after the Bucks’ 118-112 win, according to ESPN.
In fact, in this game Allen was caught again, appearing to trip a Bulls player in the third quarter of the game.

     Allen didn’t even attempt a shot in the first quarter and missed his only shot attempt in the second.
He passed the ball away so quickly on one possession it was in a teammate’s hands by the time the crowd began to boo.
Allen sat for an extended stretch before returning with 6:06 left in the half, and it looked like a potential reboot of the Caruso play was possible with 1:47 left in the half.
Allen chased down Javonte Green as Green went in for a dunk but slowed down and didn’t contest it.

     Grayson Allen’s message on Chicago boos will piss off Bulls fans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Grayson Allen is not a beloved figure in the city of Chicago.
Ever since Grayson Allen decked beloved Bulls veteran Alex Caruso, which forced him to miss several weeks and counting with a wrist injury, he’s become public enemy number one for their fanbase.
Grayson Allen asked about the crowd in post-game interview: “That was weak, I’ve had way worse in college,” said the Bucks guard on Chicago’s smattering of boos.
Johnson:“I don’t think it was a flagrant,” said the Bulls veteran.
It’s basketball.”Where Grayson Allen goes, a mix of boos and questionable fouls seem to always follow.

     The Bulls expected to make an impact on the controversial player, but Allen couldn't care less about them.
“That was weak, I’ve had way worse in college," he said, according to Brandon Sneide.
Moreover, that wasn't the only bad thing Allen had to get through during the game.
Following the game, DJJ made it clear he was just playing and didn't mean to hurt Grayson or get revenge for Caruso.
If I get a foul while in the process of trying to get a stop, then so be it.

     Bulls get 'revenge' on Grayson Allen, but lose fourth straight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Whether it was on purpose or, as Derrick Jones Jr. insists, by accident, the Bulls have finally (sort of) gotten their payback on Grayson Allen.
In a late January matchup between the Bucks and the Bulls, Allen had a flagrant 2 foul that put Bulls point guard Alex Caruso out of commission for months with a broken wrist.
Last night, in a close game that Chicago ended up dropping, 118-112, Jones Jr. hit Allen in the head with his elbow and hip-checked the former Duke star while defending a layup attempt.
Jones Jr. was handed a flagrant 1, and while many Bulls fans delighted in the payback foul, the Bulls forward insisted that the elbow hit had been accidental.
“I want to get a stop as much as they want to get a stop on the other end,” Jones Jr. said.
