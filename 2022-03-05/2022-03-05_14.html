     CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - A partial section of fans had to move seats Saturday night during Charlotte FC’s first-ever home game at Bank of America Stadium due to a cellular antenna slip.
A team spokesperson confirmed with WBTV that 20 rows of Section 520 at the stadium were cleared out as an “abundance of caution” after the cellular antenna slipped from its mount.
There were no injuries and fans in those rows were relocated.

     WCNC Charlotte learned a cellular antenna had slipped from its overhead mount and wasn't stable.
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A section of Charlotte FC fans were evacuated from their seats at Bank of America Stadium Saturday night during the team's inaugural home match against LA Galaxy.
Several members of the WCNC Charlotte team were attending the game when they noticed police directing fans in section 520 to leave.
According to WCNC digital director Blair Shiff, an officer with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said something was potentially about to fall.
WCNC Charlotte digital content producer Anders J. Hare was able to snap a photo of the fully-evacuated section from where he was in the stands, which was across from section 520.

     CHARLOTTE, N.C. – For months, Charlotte FC promised it would be and they delivered: Saturday was a party in the Queen City.
Charlotte took the field for their first-ever home match in MLS to a league-record standalone crowd that spent most of the day bringing the noise downtown into Bank of America Stadium at night.
On the field, the LA Galaxy were intent to spoil the party, though.
“We play football because we want to win, but today I believe I’m the happiest coach in the world,” head coach Miguel Ramirez told media after the match.
I’d like to thank everyone who joined us in this party because it really was a party.

“Welcome to the largest party Charlotte has known,” Charlotte FC and Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper said to the crowd moments before kickoff.
Even the signature Panthers statues outside the stadium had Charlotte FC scarves draped around their necks for the occasion.
“We've waited for this for a while,” said Lenny Romero, a Charlotte fan who wore a curly wig of Charlotte FC blue.
Still, it would give Charlotte FC a capacity of about 38,000.

     Charlotte FC is close to finalizing a deal to add Polish winger Kamil Jóźwiak to its roster, a source familiar with the situation told The Observer.
Charlotte FC expressed prior interest in Jóźwiak, who comes from EFL Championship club Derby County led by Wayne Rooney.
Jóźwiak suffered an ankle injury while in earlier talks with Charlotte, which is still looking to fortify its attacking line.
The league’s primary transfer window closes May 4, meaning Jóźwiak could soon start playing with Charlotte once his paperwork is complete.
Jóźwiak has three goals in 22 appearances with the senior Polish national team since making his debut with the squad in 2019.
