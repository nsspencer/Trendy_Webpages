     I Am Legend Sequel Starring Will Smith and Michael B. Jordan Announced
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Warner Bros. is gearing up for a sequel to 2007's I Am Legend, with Will Smith returning and Black Panther's/Creed's Michael B. Jordan co-starring, Deadline reports.
Plot details are understandably being kept under wraps, but the movie marks Smith and Jordan's first time working together as co-stars and producers.
The sequel is being penned and produced by Oscar-winning Akiva Goldsman, writer of A Beautiful Mind, Fringe, and the original I Am Legend screenplay.
The original ending, which test audiences supposedly disliked enough to make Warner Bros. reshoot it, is actually closer to the novel's chilling ending.
Smith realizes that the infected woman he's been experimenting on has a butterfly tattoo, and is the leader's mate.
