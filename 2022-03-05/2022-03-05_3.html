     Brittney Griner, Star W.N.B.A. Center, Is Detained in Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Griner’s detention comes at the most dangerous moment in U.S.-Russia relations since the Cuban missile crisis, as the Biden administration leads dozens of nations in imposing crushing sanctions on Russia’s economy and its political elites.
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said on Saturday that the sanctions were “akin to a declaration of war” against his country.
“I obviously don’t know the circumstances of her detention, but Griner’s arrest should serve as a wake-up call to all Americans in Russia,” said Michael A. McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow.
Shut down your businesses now.”The video released by Russia’s Customs Service showed a traveler passing through security screening, followed by footage of someone examining a package that appeared to be from the traveler’s bag.
The screening at the airport occurred in February, according to the Customs Service, raising the possibility that Griner, 31, has been in custody for at least several days.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     By DOUG FEINBERG, AP Basketball WriterWNBA All-Star Brittney Griner was arrested last month at a Moscow airport after Russian authorities said a search of her luggage revealed vape cartridges.
The customs service identified the person arrested as a player for the U.S. women's team and did not specify the date of her arrest.
Russian media reported the player was Griner, and her agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, did not dispute those reports.
“We are aware of the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia and are in close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her teams, and the WNBA and NBA,” Kagawa Colas said Saturday.
“Brittney Griner has the WNBA's full support and our main priority is her swift and safe return to the United States,” the league said in a statement.
