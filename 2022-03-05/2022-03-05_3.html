     Coach K sent a letter to Michael Jordan after he chose UNC over Duke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mike Krzyzewski was hired at Duke ahead of the 1980–81 season.
Coincidentally, a top high school player named Michael Jordan was being recruited that same year.
And, as the story goes, North Carolina native Jordan chose Duke’s rival UNC and began his college career in 1981 there.
Various letters from Coach K have gone viral ahead of his final home game in Cameron Indoor on Saturday, and now a letter the longtime Blue Devils coach sent Jordan in 1980 is going viral.
However, what makes it significant this time is the context of knowing how Coach K sent letters throughout his whole 42-year career at Duke.

     A boatload of Blue Devils is in Durham for the UNC-Duke basketball clash.
4 Duke Blue Devils (26-4, 16-3 ACC) take on the unranked yet hungry UNC Tar Heels (22-8, 14-5 ACC) at 6 p.m.
And guys like ESPN commentator Jay Bilas and ACC Network analyst Carlos Boozer likely would have been there anyway as part of their job description since both ESPN and the ACC Network will broadcast the game with more than 100 employees on site.
Still, it seems they have all tweeted out their support for Coach K on this historic day.

     Prop bets for Duke men's basketball vs. North Carolina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This isn’t to say that Saturday night’s matchup in Durham will be easy for Duke, as North Carolina has won six of its last seven games since that 20-point home loss to Duke in February.
Still, it is not surprising that Duke is favored by double digits entering the matchup.
How will North Carolina handle a loud and confident crowd in Cameron Indoor Stadium after suffering one of its worst home defeats in two decades a month prior?
These are just some of the factors that will affect the game’s outcome, but given the significance of the matchup for Duke, and just how much it dominated in the last matchup, Duke should be a pretty confident pick here.
It wouldn’t be surprising to see Keels have another field day in Duke's last regular-season game of the year.

If you had to make a North Carolina Duke prediction in the 1970s, that prediction would have almost always leaned to the Tar Heels.
Yes, you have to make a North Carolina Duke pick, but this day is about a man more than about a betting line.
