     Coach K sent a letter to Michael Jordan after he chose UNC over Duke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mike Krzyzewski was hired at Duke ahead of the 1980–81 season.
Coincidentally, a top high school player named Michael Jordan was being recruited that same year.
And, as the story goes, North Carolina native Jordan chose Duke’s rival UNC and began his college career in 1981 there.
Various letters from Coach K have gone viral ahead of his final home game in Cameron Indoor on Saturday, and now a letter the longtime Blue Devils coach sent Jordan in 1980 is going viral.
However, what makes it significant this time is the context of knowing how Coach K sent letters throughout his whole 42-year career at Duke.

     More problematic is the fact that the Tar Heels have not only lost, but been blown out of multiple measuring-stick games such as No.
That includes a romp against the rival Tar Heels, who will be eager to prove they're better than what they showed in last month's 20-point loss on their homecourt.
"Duke (26-4, 16-3) has already wrapped up the program's first outright Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season championship since 2006, which will send the Blue Devils to New York with the No.
