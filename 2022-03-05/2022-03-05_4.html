     YouTube Gold: Coach K And Duke In The 1980’s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Saturday, Mike Krzyzewski will coach his final game in Cameron.
As everyone knows, Coach K was under some pressure in his second and third year, at least from some fans.
Small point to illustrate K’s longevity: he’s worked for four different AD’s at Duke - Butters, Joe Alleva, Kevin White and at the end, Nina King.
Duke won 24 games after Tommy Amaker joined Johnny Dawkins, Jay Bilas, Mark Alarie, David Henderson and Dan Meaghar to help Duke become a rising power.
The 1987 team was critical because after Dawkins, Bilas, Alarie and Henderson left, things could have taken a major step backwards.

     More problematic is the fact that the Tar Heels have not only lost, but been blown out of multiple measuring-stick games such as No.
That includes a romp against the rival Tar Heels, who will be eager to prove they're better than what they showed in last month's 20-point loss on their homecourt.
"Duke (26-4, 16-3) has already wrapped up the program's first outright Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season championship since 2006, which will send the Blue Devils to New York with the No.
Griffin.The Blue Devils' four losses have come by a combined nine points, the last being 69-68 at home to Virginia on a last-second 3-pointer.
"These guys look like a machine out here, they look like one of our old teams," he told them.

     Duke's been there for us through the ups and downs and it's all because of what Coach K built.
Out of my price rangeEdward De La Garza has never met Mike Krzyzweski, but he has intimate insight into his day-to-day activities.
Ellen has been a fan since she became attached to De La Garza more than 30 years ago.
He had made his sign the night before, a sweetly penned note to Coach K with hand drawn hearts around the posterboard.
Growing up in North Carolina, she understands the importance of the rivalry, Coach K and what basketball means to this state.
