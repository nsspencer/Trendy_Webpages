     Warriors' road only getting tougher amid four-game losing streak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On March 5, a loss to LeBron's Lakers means rock bottom for the Warriors.
But the Lakers had lost eight of their last 10 and owned a four-game losing streak.
Now, the Warriors are the ones who are owners of a season-high four-game losing streak after falling 124-116.
"We are not sending a lot of our players to Denver," Kerr said after Saturday night's loss.
What's clear, however, is the Warriors' road is only going to get bumpier in the immediate future.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     King of LA: The Lakers started LeBron James at center Saturday against the Warriors and he was absolutely dominant.
Bench shines in second quarter: Warriors head coach Steve Kerr expressed his concerns about the lack of cohesion in team’s second unit in recent weeks.
Golden State still surrendered 30 points in the second quarter, but made up the difference by scoring 42.
There was a stretch in the second quarter where the Warriors were plus-14 with Stephen Curry on the bench.
After playing the entire first quarter, he played just five minutes in the second, as the Warriors’ bench outscored the Lakers’ bench 36-9.

    </h2>

     LOS ANGELES — The Warriors limped into Los Angeles vulnerable, and LeBron James smelled blood.
The loss was Golden State’s fourth straight, knocking them down to the third seed, one game back of the Memphis Grizzlies.
James was brilliant on Saturday, but the Warriors let a 14-point lead slip because they surrendered second-chance points, failed box outs and took bad shots.
Poole scored 16 points in the first half, finishing with 23 points and four 3-pointers while Kuminga nailed three key open 3-pointers in an 18-point night.
LeBron was amazing.”The Warriors kept the win within reach, but couldn’t wrangle enough offensive rebounds in the final minutes of the game.
