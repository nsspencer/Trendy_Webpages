     Stephen Curry bucks up Golden State Warriors after skid hits 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LOS ANGELES -- The Golden State Warriors have dug themselves into a deep hole -- their 124-116 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers being the latest shovel full of issues.
"We cannot give in to this losing mentality," Stephen Curry said.
Curry did his best not to give in, leading the Warriors with 30 points on 13-of-22 shooting, including 4-of-9 from 3.
The Warriors' problems have ranged from defensive lapses, to not enough production off the bench, to late-game execution -- which is where Kerr put the blame for the latest loss.
As Curry said, the Warriors are trying to fight the losing mentality, but it's impossible not to notice the shift in morale.

     King of LA: The Lakers started LeBron James at center Saturday against the Warriors and he was absolutely dominant.
Bench shines in second quarter: Warriors head coach Steve Kerr expressed his concerns about the lack of cohesion in team’s second unit in recent weeks.
Golden State still surrendered 30 points in the second quarter, but made up the difference by scoring 42.
There was a stretch in the second quarter where the Warriors were plus-14 with Stephen Curry on the bench.
After playing the entire first quarter, he played just five minutes in the second, as the Warriors’ bench outscored the Lakers’ bench 36-9.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LOS ANGELES — The Warriors limped into Los Angeles vulnerable, and LeBron James smelled blood.
The loss was Golden State’s fourth straight, knocking them down to the third seed, one game back of the Memphis Grizzlies.
James was brilliant on Saturday, but the Warriors let a 14-point lead slip because they surrendered second-chance points, failed box outs and took bad shots.
Poole scored 16 points in the first half, finishing with 23 points and four 3-pointers while Kuminga nailed three key open 3-pointers in an 18-point night.
LeBron was amazing.”The Warriors kept the win within reach, but couldn’t wrangle enough offensive rebounds in the final minutes of the game.
