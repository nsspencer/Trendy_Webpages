     A boatload of Blue Devils is in Durham for the UNC-Duke basketball clash.
4 Duke Blue Devils (26-4, 16-3 ACC) take on the unranked yet hungry UNC Tar Heels (22-8, 14-5 ACC) at 6 p.m.
And guys like ESPN commentator Jay Bilas and ACC Network analyst Carlos Boozer likely would have been there anyway as part of their job description since both ESPN and the ACC Network will broadcast the game with more than 100 employees on site.
Still, it seems they have all tweeted out their support for Coach K on this historic day.
Stay tuned to Ball Durham for more Duke basketball news and views.

     Duke Honored Coach K Before His Final Home Game As Blue Devils Head Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It was a week of anticipation, excitement and reflection leading up to the moment doors opened inside Cameron Indoor Stadium for Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski’s last home game with the Blue Devils.
Numerous photos emerged of Coach K savoring the moment as if he was holding back tears of joy after giving 42 years of dedicated service to the Blue Devils program and the Duke community.
Whether Duke wins or loses the Battle of Tobacco Road on Saturday night, the beginning of the end to Coach K’s tenure at Duke is undeniably a moment in time that sports fans will never forget.
Coach K was not simply the head coach for the Blue Devils.
But the body of work that Coach K has done in his lifetime will be remembered well beyond his time on the sidelines of Cameron Indoor Stadium.

Following Carrawell was Smith, who did shake Davis’ hand but blatantly turned his head away from him.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After such sustained excellence, Saturday evening was the last time Mike “Coach K” Krzyzewski will have ever roamed courtside at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
4 Duke played historic rival North Carolina (who came in as an 11-point underdog on Saturday).
The Tar Heels would win 94-81, but Krzyzewski’s Blue Devils, as usual, have higher aspirations.
The Blue Devils, led by potential Freshman of the Year and surefire NBA lottery pick Paolo Banchero, have the nation’s No.
Even better, in what is assuredly a credit to Coach K’s steady hand, Duke plays disciplined defense without fouling.
