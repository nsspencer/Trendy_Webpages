     Duke Honored Coach K Before His Final Home Game As Blue Devils Head Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It was a week of anticipation, excitement and reflection leading up to the moment doors opened inside Cameron Indoor Stadium for Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski’s last home game with the Blue Devils.
Numerous photos emerged of Coach K savoring the moment as if he was holding back tears of joy after giving 42 years of dedicated service to the Blue Devils program and the Duke community.
Whether Duke wins or loses the Battle of Tobacco Road on Saturday night, the beginning of the end to Coach K’s tenure at Duke is undeniably a moment in time that sports fans will never forget.
Coach K was not simply the head coach for the Blue Devils.
But the body of work that Coach K has done in his lifetime will be remembered well beyond his time on the sidelines of Cameron Indoor Stadium.

     SHOCKED: Duke men's basketball loses against North Carolina in Coach K's last home game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Approximately 9,314 Duke fans left Cameron Indoor Stadium feeling nothing but shock—Duke had just lost its final home game of the year to none other than North Carolina.
Minutes later, North Carolina took a timeout with 2:57 remaining, and Manek drained a three immediately upon resumption.
North Carolina struck first out of the half, but Williams responded with a tip-in basket on the other end.
After the under-12 media timeout, Duke turned the ball over on the inbound and North Carolina had the ball in transition.
Despite Duke improving its play after that first timeout of the game, North Carolina wouldn’t go away.

     Mike Krzyzewski gives praise to Duke's successful season despite the loss to UNC in his final home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
The basketball world wasn't simply going to watch Krzyzewski, the winningest coach ever, ride off into the sunset.
The game didn't matter much in the standings either.
Funny thing is, Krzyzewski didn't seem to mind all that much.
They weren't here to see Duke win -- even in a game against hated North Carolina.
