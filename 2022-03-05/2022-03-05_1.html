     Russia Says It Has American Basketball Player in Custody
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Russian Federal Customs Service said Saturday that its officials had detained an American basketball player after finding vape cartridges that contained hashish oil in her luggage at the Sheremetyevo airport near Moscow.
The Customs Service said in a statement that the player had won two Olympic gold medals with the United States, but it did not release the player’s name.
The Russian news agency TASS, citing a law enforcement source, identified the player as Brittney Griner, a seven-time W.N.B.A.
Griner, 31, won gold medals with the U.S. women’s national basketball team in 2021 and 2016.
The screening at the airport occurred in February, according to the Customs Service, raising the possibility that Griner has been in custody for at least several days.

     WNBA star Brittney Griner detained in Russia on drug charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner was taken into custody in Moscow and faces drug smuggling charges after being found with vape cartridges in her carry-on luggage.
Griner, a seven-time WNBA All-Star and two-time Olympic gold medalist, has spent nine seasons in the WNBA and has led the league in blocks in eight of those years.
“We are aware of the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia and are in close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her teams, and the WNBA and NBA,” Griner’s agent Lindsay Kagawa Colas said.
Officials say Griner was carrying vaping equipment with cannabis oil cartridges and can face up to 10 years in prison.
Griner's detainment also comes in the backdrop of Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine and the increasing diplomatic strain between the United States and Russia.

     Women’s basketball superstar Brittney Griner detained in Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Brittney Griner, one of America’s most decorated women’s basketball players, has been detained by Russian Federal Customs Service authorities after the discovery of vape cartridges that contained hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow.
According to the Customs Service statement, drug-sniffing dogs in the airport’s customs area indicated the possible presence of narcotic drugs in the player’s baggage following her arrival on a flight from New York.
The Customs Service also released a video on Saturday in which the airport security services are seen going through the luggage of a passenger identified as Griner.
Brittney Griner has led Russian club UMMC Ekaterinburg to three domestic titles and EuroLeague Women championships in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2021.
Earlier Saturday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, held an hour-long video call with United States senators in which he called for more support to defend his country from Russia’s invasion.
