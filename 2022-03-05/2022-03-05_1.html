Getty ImagesAfter being awarded the fight by the judges 49-46, 50-45, 50-44, Covington called out Dustin Poirier.
I was flat-footed today.”The co-main event saw Rafael Dos Anjos claim a one-sided unanimous decision win over Renato Moicano.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The dislike went back and forth between Colby Covington and Jorge Masvidal in the buildup to the fight.
But once it got started, the traffic went one way — Covington dominated the bout en route to a unanimous decision on the scorecards: 49-46, 50-44 and 50-45.
In the third, Dos Anjos landed a perfect head kick, then laid down a hellacious beating on the mat.
Dos Anjos dominated again in the fourth, and the doctor again cleared him.
Dos Anjos noticeably took his foot off the gas pedal in the fifth and cruised to seal his 20th career UFC win.

     Jake Paul wasted no time in reacting to Jorge Masvidal’s defeat to Colby Covington at UFC 272.
Covington claimed a unanimous decision victory as the bitter rivals, who were former training partners, settled their score in the Octagon.
It wasn’t the brutal war many hoped for or UFC advertised.
I’ve really been doing this close to 20 years professionally now.Who the f*** is this Jake Paul guy bro?
It seems that their ongoing war of words will not let up any time soon.

For as good as Covington proved he still is by manhandling the 2019 fighter of the year, he didn't stop Masvidal like Usman spectacularly did with one punch in their 2021 rematch.
Should you find yourself physically agitated at even the sight of Covington, that only means his attempt at doing so is working.
But don't let his calculated lack of decorum go too far in allowing you to miss just how smart and talented he really is.
Covington never actually needed Donald Trump or the many half-dressed models he paid to stand next to him during interviews in order to become a great fighter.

     UFC 272: After beating Jorge Masvidal, Colby Covington's likely to keep making it personal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After mercilessly ridiculing the UFC welterweight champ in the buildup, Covington hugged Usman and said, "You know I'm just trying to sell it for you.
There was no championship on the line, making this a rare pay-per-view without a single title fight.
Covington's win keeps him near the top of the 170-pound division, but he won't be seeing the champ anytime soon -- unless that belt is being worn by Leon Edwards, who has been promised the next UFC welterweight title challenge.
At the end of UFC 272, Covington tried to continue the ugly narrative.
And what we saw at the end of the night between Covington and Masvidal was anything but that.
