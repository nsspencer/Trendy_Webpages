     Duke Honored Coach K Before His Final Home Game As Blue Devils Head Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It was a week of anticipation, excitement and reflection leading up to the moment doors opened inside Cameron Indoor Stadium for Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski’s last home game with the Blue Devils.
Numerous photos emerged of Coach K savoring the moment as if he was holding back tears of joy after giving 42 years of dedicated service to the Blue Devils program and the Duke community.
Whether Duke wins or loses the Battle of Tobacco Road on Saturday night, the beginning of the end to Coach K’s tenure at Duke is undeniably a moment in time that sports fans will never forget.
Coach K was not simply the head coach for the Blue Devils.
But the body of work that Coach K has done in his lifetime will be remembered well beyond his time on the sidelines of Cameron Indoor Stadium.

     A boatload of Blue Devils is in Durham for the UNC-Duke basketball clash.
4 Duke Blue Devils (26-4, 16-3 ACC) take on the unranked yet hungry UNC Tar Heels (22-8, 14-5 ACC) at 6 p.m.
And guys like ESPN commentator Jay Bilas and ACC Network analyst Carlos Boozer likely would have been there anyway as part of their job description since both ESPN and the ACC Network will broadcast the game with more than 100 employees on site.
Still, it seems they have all tweeted out their support for Coach K on this historic day.
Stay tuned to Ball Durham for more Duke basketball news and views.

     In his final home Duke game, Mike Krzyzewski walks out to a huge ovation from former players he coached as well as the fans.
Cameron Indoor might as well have rolled out an official red carpet for the occasion.
💙🐐💙🐐💙🐐💙🐐💙🐐💙🐐 #CoachK pic.twitter.com/5MFT2sz3tc — Duke Men's Basketball (@DukeMBB) March 5, 2022Beyond the 96 former players in attendance to see Krzyzewski off, a bevy of stars from sports and Hollywood was in the stands, too.
The former players formed a tunnel leading from one corner of the baseline to midcourt, and as Krzyzewski was announced, the crowd erupted.
After Krzyzewski made his way to the end of the line, the group gathered at midcourt for a photo of the family reunion.

     Duke fans go wild as Coach K takes the floor through a tunnel formed by former Blue Devils stars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Legendary Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski’s resume speaks for itself.
It’s also perfectly fitting that his last game at the Blue Devils’ home arena came against their most bitter rival in North Carolina.
It will certainly be bizarre when current assistant coach Jon Scheyer takes the reigns next season and leads this team into Cameron Indoor, instead.
His Blue Devils squad entered the regular-season finale at 26-4 with the best record in the ACC at 16-3.

     Duke basketball leads UNC 41-39 in Coach K’s last home game. Takeaways from first half
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Blue Devils scored 30 points in the paint in the opening 20 minutes.
Once the Blue Devils calmed down after the game’s first timeout, they found their footing offensively.
But it wasn’t until UNC center Armando Bacot picked up his second foul that the Blue Devils were able to create some separation from their rivals.
Banchero’s 3-pointer gave Duke momentum and the Blue Devils’ surge grew after Bacot went to the bench at 6:22 after being called for his second foul.
R.J. Davis shiningUNC sophomore guard R.J. Davis has 11 points in the first half on 5-for-9 shooting from the field.
