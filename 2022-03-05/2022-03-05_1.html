     Brittney Griner, Star W.N.B.A. Center, Is Detained in Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Russia said on Saturday that it had detained an American basketball player in Moscow on drug charges, entangling a U.S. citizen’s fate in the dangerous confrontation between Russia and the West over Ukraine.
The Customs Service said in a statement that the player had won two Olympic gold medals with the United States, but it did not release the player’s name.
The Russian news agency Tass, citing a law enforcement source, identified the player as Brittney Griner, a seven-time W.N.B.A.
Griner, 31, won gold medals with the U.S. women’s national basketball team in 2021 and 2016.
“We are aware of the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia and are in close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her teams and the W.N.B.A.

Griner was reportedly arrested in February when officials found "vape cartridges in her carry-on luggage at a Moscow airport," The New York Post said, citing Russian news sources.
Video from the Russian Federal Customs Service allegedly shows what appears to be Griner getting her bag searched at the airport in Russia.

     WNBA All-Star Brittney Griner arrested in Russia on drug charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WNBA All-Star and two-time Olympic champion Brittney Griner faces 5 to 10 years in Russian prison, after she was arrested on drug smuggling charges when she was found with vape cartridges in her carry-on luggage at a Moscow airport, according to Russian news sources.
“We are aware of and are closely monitoring the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia,” the team said in a statement.
It did not specify when Griner was arrested, but her Team USA teammate Angel McCoughtry tweeted that she’s been held for three weeks.
Griner was arrested after vape cartridges were found in her carry-on luggage at a Moscow airport.
Griner, 31, a member of the 2014 WNBA Champion Mercury and the 2021 and 2016 Olympics gold medal team, has played during the WNBA off-season for the Russian team Ekaterinburg in the Euroleague since 2015.

     WNBA Star Brittney Griner Arrested in Russia on Drug Charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     American basketball player Brittney Griner, one of the WNBA’s biggest stars, was arrested last month by Russian customs officials at a Moscow airport on suspicion of drug smuggling after authorities said they found vape cartridges with hashish oil in her luggage.
The smuggling of narcotic substances on a substantial scale in Russia carries a sentence of potential imprisonment for up to 10 years.
Griner, a 31-year-old WNBA champion and perennial All-Star, is one of many American women’s basketball players who spend their winters in Russia.
There they command annual salaries of more than $1 million, nearly five times the WNBA’s maximum salary.
The WNBA said last week that all of the league’s players in Ukraine had fled the country and many players in Russia were making plans to exit.
