     Brittney Griner, Star W.N.B.A. Center, Is Detained in Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Russia said on Saturday that it had detained an American basketball player in Moscow on drug charges, entangling a U.S. citizen’s fate in the dangerous confrontation between Russia and the West over Ukraine.
The Customs Service said in a statement that the player had won two Olympic gold medals with the United States, but it did not release the player’s name.
The Russian news agency Tass, citing a law enforcement source, identified the player as Brittney Griner, a seven-time W.N.B.A.
Griner, 31, won gold medals with the U.S. women’s national basketball team in 2021 and 2016.
“We are aware of the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia and are in close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her teams and the W.N.B.A.

     Brittney Griner detained in Russia: American basketball star found with hashish oil at airport, per reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Seven-time WNBA All-Star center Brittney Griner, 31, has been detained by the Russian Federal Customs Service after it claims to have found hashish oil in her luggage, according to the New York Times and Russian news agency TASS.
When Griner's luggage was checked at a security checkpoint at Sheremetyevo International Airport, customs allegedly found vape cartridges that contained the hashish oil.
A number of American basketball players have already left Russia and Ukraine, returning to the United States amid the ongoing war between the nations.
The airport screening occurred in February, which means that Griner has likely been in custody ever since.
