     Tyrese Maxey Becomes Philly's Scoring Star In 76ers Win Over Cleveland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While Harden’s 25 points and 11 assists will grab headlines and Joel Embiid’s 22 points and nine rebounds solidify his top spot in the MVP conversation, Tyrese Maxey was the star in the Sixers’ come from behind 125-119 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers Friday night.
The second-year guard ran roughshod over the Cavaliers’ defense in the second half, scoring 14 points in the third quarter to erase Cleveland’s early 21 point lead late.
Tyrese Maxey is HIM.
Despite the new “Big 3” talk in Philadelphia, Maxey doesn’t see it that way.
“I don’t think we look at it as Big 3, Big 2,” Maxey said per ESPN.

     Tyrese Maxey Scores 33 In Dramatic 76ers Win Over Cavaliers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tyrese Maxey is Philadelphia’s version of a Big 3.
Tyrese Maxey made 5 3-pointers and managed to score 33 points to help the 76ers win their 5th straight game, 125-119 over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night.
“I don’t think we look at it as Big 3, Big 2,” Maxey said.
But his presence has turned Maxey into a knock-off, Allen Iverson, since his arrival.
Maxey made 76ers fans – and, frankly, the 76ers – forget about Ben Simmons with his play this season.

     Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff feeling impressed by Sixers guard Tyrese Maxey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA–The play of young Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey has continued to impress the rest of the NBA.
In four games playing with new star guard James Harden, Maxey is averaging 26.8 points while shooting 64.9% from the floor and 70% from deep on 5.0 attempts per game.
Before the Sixers took on the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff was highly impressed by Maxey and his play.
When the Sixers need a bucket and the two superstars are bottled up, then Maxey comes in with the big shot or the big play.
“He knows that he has a job to do in order to help this team be successful.”This post originally appeared on Sixers Wire!

     Philadelphia 76ers: Is Tyrese Maxey to key to a deep playoff run?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Could Tyrese Maxey be the key for a deep playoff run for the Philadelphia 76ers?
In four games with the Sixers, Harden is averaging 27 points, eight rebounds, and 12 assists per game.
Specifically, I think it’s only fair to consider that Tyrese Maxey may be the key to a long playoff run for the Sixers.
In a playoff series, the Sixers are going to need a third consistent player to rise if they’re going to make a deep playoff run.
Maxey is a rising star in the league and could get his moment in the postseason if he helps the Sixers make a deep playoff run and possibly get to the NBA Finals.

     In the first quarter, Cleveland shot nearly 75-percent from the field and 80-percent from three.
By the time the second quarter rolled around, the Cavaliers had come back down to earth on the offensive end.
As the veterans combined for 17 points, they helped the Sixers outscore the Cavaliers 33-28 before heading into halftime.
As the two stars collected 19 of Philly’s 28 points, they helped the Sixers complete an impressive 125-119 win over the Cavaliers.
Now, they are set to face the Miami Heat for the second night of a back-to-back on Saturday as they roll down to South Beach following Friday’s big win.

     Maxey’s 33 leads 76ers to victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Tyrese Maxey made five 3-pointers and scored 33 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to their fifth straight win, 125-119 over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night.
The second-year guard out of Kentucky tore through the Cavaliers in the second half and seemingly turned Embiid and Harden into bystanders.
Maxey made 76ers fans — and, frankly, the 76ers — forget about Ben Simmons with his play this season.
He scored 20 points for the fourth straight game, the longest streak of his career — and all with Harden.
The Cavaliers hit their first nine shots and Kevin Love hit a pair of 3s to help them race to a 39-18 lead.
