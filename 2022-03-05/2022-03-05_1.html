     The Customs Service said in a statement that the player had won two Olympic gold medals with the United States, but it did not release the player’s name.
The Russian news agency TASS, citing a law enforcement source, identified the player as Brittney Griner, a seven-time W.N.B.A.
Griner, 31, won gold medals with the U.S. women’s national basketball team in 2021 and 2016.

     WNBA star Brittney Griner detained in Russia on drug charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner was taken into custody in Moscow and faces drug smuggling charges after being found with vape cartridges in her carry-on luggage.
Griner, a seven-time WNBA All-Star and two-time Olympic gold medalist, has spent nine seasons in the WNBA and has led the league in blocks in eight of those years.
“We are aware of the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia and are in close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her teams, and the WNBA and NBA,” Griner’s agent Lindsay Kagawa Colas said.
Officials say Griner was carrying vaping equipment with cannabis oil cartridges and can face up to 10 years in prison.
Griner's detainment also comes in the backdrop of Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine and the increasing diplomatic strain between the United States and Russia.
