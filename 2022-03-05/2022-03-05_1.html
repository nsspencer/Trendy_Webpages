     UFC 272 results, highlights: Colby Covington grinds out decision win over Jorge Masvidal to end rivalry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Colby Covington and Jorge Masvidal were once close friends before their relationship soured and the pair spent years trading barbs in interviews.
The takedown came much easier for Covington in Round 3, planting Masvidal along the cage with a double-leg.
"I just took care of Miami street trash now it's time to take care of Louisiana swamp trash," Covington said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After being warned for an early eye poke before round two began, Covington took some more kicks as Masvidal started the round strong, even landing elbows to the side of the head as Covington looked for the takedown.
It was Covington stunning Masvidal briefly before the horn sounded, though.
With 90 seconds left, Covington looked for a choke, and while Masvidal tried to scramble free, ‚ÄúChaos‚Äù wasn‚Äôt having it until Masvidal got daylight and landed two lefts at the end of the round.
Masvidal seemingly had Covington hurt, but he didn‚Äôt press the action as it appeared fatigue was settling in.
Covington stayed locked up with his opponent, dragging him to the canvas, where Masvidal had no answers.

     Masvidal acted as a mentor to Covington when Covington arrived at American Top Team in 2011 after an illustrious career wrestling at Oregon State University.
Covington helped Masvidal with his wrestling skills, while Masvidal helped teach Covington how to strike.
Covington, the former UFC interim welterweight champion, landed six takedowns Saturday, giving him 67 for his career, the second-most in UFC welterweight history.
"He makes you worry about the takedown," UFC president Dana White said in the postfight news conference.
"You could see in his body language he had nothing left in the fight," Covington said of Masvidal.
