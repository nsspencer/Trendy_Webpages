     Stephen Curry ejected in fourth quarter of Golden State Warriors' win over Memphis Grizzlies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen Curry didn't see the end of the Golden State Warriors' 122-120 win over the Memphis Grizzlies Wednesday, as the All-Star guard was ejected with 1:14 left in the fourth quarter at Chase Center.
Curry threw his mouthpiece after being upset with teammate Jordan Poole for not passing him the ball and rushing a 3-point shot after an offensive rebound.
"When you want something really bad, like getting a win, fourth quarter execution, clutch time type situation, all that stuff does matter.
The Warriors (24-24) defeated the Grizzlies on a last-second layup by Poole after overcoming a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter.
When Poole saw Curry in the tunnel after the game, he playfully threw his mouthpiece at him before hugging Curry.

     Steph Curry ejected for throwing mouthpiece in Warriors-Grizzlies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For just the third time in his career, Stephen Curry was ejected from an NBA game.
The Golden State Warriors point guard was extremely frustrated after Jordan Poole took a 30-footer with just over a minute left to play against the Memphis grizzlies.
Jordan Poole managed to redeem himself with the game-winning cut and layup off a brilliant baseline inbounds play drawn up by head coach Steve Kerr.
Steph Curry’s mouthpiece ultimately became the biggest loser on the Warriors side, getting discarded for the world to see.
Otherwise, it was a gritty victory for Golden State against one of their bitter rivals.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Donte DiVincenzo grabbed the offensive board and quickly passed to Jordan Poole, and that's where things got out of hand.
With Curry calling for the ball, Poole threw up a quick 3-pointer.
Curry, out of apparent frustration with Poole, angrily tossed his mouthpiece into the stands.
Poole shared his annoyance with the decision to eject Curry after the game.
Regardless of the outcome, the officials will face quite a bit of scrutiny for their decision to eject Curry.

     Jordan Poole atones for mistake, Steph Curry's mouthpiece throw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And, lastly, Jordan Poole, whose mindless shot was the source of Curry’s anger that led to his ejection, approached the team’s touchstone.
Poole then threw his mouthpiece, mimicking the gesture for which Curry was ejected with 1:14 remaining and the Warriors clinging to a two-point lead.
Curry’s grin split into full laughter and he and Poole slapped palms and embraced.
“We needed this win in a desperate way,” Curry said.
As for Poole’s ill-advised shot and Curry’s mouthpiece-throwing reaction, coach Steve Kerr excused both players.
