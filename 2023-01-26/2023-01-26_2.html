     Damian Lillard's latest 60-point masterpiece moves him into a tie with Michael Jordan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lillard's individual scoring has been all that's kept the Blazers afloat in January.
A stellar 60 points on 21-of-29 shooting, making him just the fourth player in NBA history to score 60 points on 70 percent shooting, joining Wilt Chamberlain (four times), David Thompson and Karl Malone.
For the game, Lillard came just shy of scoring half of Portland's 124 total points.
Lillard's fourth 60-point game of his career moved him into a tie with Michael Jordan and James Harden.
If they need Lillard to score 60 just to survive a January dalliance with the Jazz, this team is probably in a fair bit of trouble moving forward.
