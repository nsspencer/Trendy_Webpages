     Alice in Borderland: Season 2 – Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We continue from season 1 – but no recap!
Season 2 of Alice in Borderland does not open with a recap.
Season 1 premiered on Netflix in December of 2020, so it’s been a good two years.
However, despite Alice in Borderland season 2 not having a recap at the beginning, episode 1 of this second season does have a few flashbacks.
Actually, this is pretty smart in lieu of a recap; To remind us of the rules from season 1, but focus on the lack of rules in season 2.

     Summary: Alice in Borderland Episode 1 Season 2 Episode 1 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * Previous Next » « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Photo Credit: Kumiko TsuchiyaHeading into season two, Alice in Borderland has much to live up to.
In season two, we meet people involved in running these games at an even higher level: the Face Cards.
We meet the King of Spades first as he guns down players the anti-tank cannons sniping from above can’t get.
In the aftermath, Ann gets separated from the rest of the group, with Arisu, Usagi, Kuina, and Tatta finding time to regroup at an empty office building.
One of the elements of Alice in Borderland I’ve always appreciated is the pacing between the high-octane gameplay and the quieter moments in between.
