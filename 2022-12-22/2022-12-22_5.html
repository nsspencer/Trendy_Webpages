     ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ Was So Good China Scrapped Its Ripoff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How good was Top Gun: Maverick?
It was set to be the nation’s answer to the Top Gun sequel, which would be great because Top Gun: Maverick was never cleared for release in China.
Or, put another way: Top Gun: Maverick was too damn good.
It was made in cooperation with the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, just as Top Gun: Maverick was made with help from the U.S. Navy.
“It could come anytime,” they said, “or it might never come at all.”In the meantime, in the good ol’ U.S. of A., Top Gun: Maverick just hit Paramount+.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The bad guys in Top Gun: Maverick may have been explicitly vague other people from some other place with some other ideology in an attempt to make sure the movie would still play in countries that Hollywood has… historically offended.
That mostly worked out, with the movie making a ton of money internationally, but it never did get a release in China for a few reasons.
But there was a problem: Maverick was really goddamn good, and Born To Fly, apparently, was not.
It’s like if Top Gun: Maverick made a big deal about how great Tim Cruise is, and then it didn’t even make Tim Cruise look very cool.
So, rather than risk any sort of embarrassment, the movie was canned.

     Summary: While the streaming release of Top Gun: Maverick will bring its extraordinary theater run to a close, it will also quell any fears about the Top Gun sequel’s re-watch potential.
However, Top Gun: Maverick is also simply a superb action movie that can hold up to re-watches.
However, the Top Gun: Maverick streaming release is also huge for Paramount+.
Whether this will be enough to see the Top Gun sequel succeed on streaming remains to be seen, but Top Gun: Maverick certainly isn’t hurt by the transition.

     What's Happening With Top Gun: Maverick Lawsuit As Tom Cruise Blockbuster Hits Streaming
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This year saw the return of Tom Cruise’s Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell as he and the cast of Top Gun: Maverick delivered a massive hit.
However, that success eventually saw a recent lawsuit filed against the studio, which has come into focus again as Maverick hits streaming.
With the production of Top Gun: Maverick being claimed as completed in May 2021, the Yonay family believes that said sequel infringed their rights to the source material.
As we’re currently at the end of 2022, we might not hear anything further about the Top Gun lawsuit until early in 2023.
At the moment, you’re now able to enjoy Top Gun: Maverick in the comfort of your own home.

     China made its own ‘Top Gun: Maverick,’ but pulled it days before release to avoid embarrassment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It goes without saying that Top Gun: Maverick isn’t just the best blockbuster of the year, but one of the finest slices of big budget escapism of the entire modern era, if not all-time.
Joseph Kosinski and Tom Cruise delivered a masterclass in high-octane filmmaking that won rave reviews from critics, countless repeat viewings from audiences, almost $1.5 billion at the box office, and a potential dark horse Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.
Seeking to capitalize, the Chinese film industry sought to make a Maverick of its own.
Not only that, but Born to Fly reportedly “risked ridicule in comparison,” which would have been embarrassing for the staunchly self-preservative and increasingly anti-Hollywood censorship board.
Even now, it remains up for debate as to whether or not it’ll even release at all, but whenever it does; it ain’t gonna be no Maverick.

     Mission Aborted: Why China’s ‘Top Gun’ Never Took Off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The country’s most daring and promising young fighter pilot takes part in a top-secret testing program for the military’s most advanced fighter jets.
With hot young Chinese test pilots and heart-stopping aerial acrobatics, Born to Fly was supposed to be China’s answer to Top Gun: Maverick.
The wildly anticipated action flick stars Wang Yibo, a pop star turned actor (think China’s Harry Styles), and was written and directed by Liu Xiaoshi, who cut his teeth making popular promotional videos for the Chinese military.
Produced in full cooperation with the People’s Liberation Army Air Force — much as Maverick was with the U.S. Navy — the film showcases China’s most advanced stealth fighter jet, the J-20.
There was a time when Maverick himself was actually expected to cruise into China’s airspace.
