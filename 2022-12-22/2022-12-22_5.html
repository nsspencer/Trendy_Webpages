     Tesla under investigation by NHTSA for two more crashes that may have involved Autopilot or FSD
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla offers a standard driver assistance package called Autopilot in all its new cars today.
Another recent crash added to NHTSA's list involved a 2020 Tesla Model 3, the company's entry-level sedan.
According to data obtained from NHTSA by CNBC, the agency is looking into at least 41 crashes involving Tesla vehicles where automated features such as automatic emergency braking, or more extensive driver assistance system features included in Autopilot, FSD and FSD Beta were involved.
The California DMV has accused Tesla of engaging in false advertising around its driver assistance systems.
Amid tough economic conditions, Tesla has recently offered steep discounts on its cars in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and China.

     Tesla shares tumble, on track for worst month ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dec 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares are on track for their worst month ever as a sell-off deepened on Thursday over worries about softening demand for electric cars and Chief Executive Elon Musk's distraction with Twitter.
Tesla's stock has tumbled 36% so far in December, putting it on track for its worst ever monthly performance.
By comparison, Tesla's shares dropped 22% in March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic tipped financial markets into a tailspin.
Musk has also sold almost $40 billion worth of his Tesla shares this year, adding to pressure on the stock as investors worry he could sell more to keep Twitter afloat.

     Summary: Dec 22 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Thursday he will not sell any more Tesla stock for about two years.
His comments came after a Tesla stock sell-off deepened on Thursday over worries about softening demand for electric cars and Musk's distraction with Twitter and his stock sales.
"I won't sell stock until I don't know probably two years from now.
Musk has previously made promises about not selling Tesla stock before subsequently selling it.
"(Twitter) is maybe 10% of the complexity of Tesla," Musk said.

     U.S. safety agency probes two more Tesla crashes involving suspected driver assistance

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [1/2] A Tesla logo on a Model S is photographed inside of a Tesla dealership in New York, U.S., April 29, 2016.
REUTERS/Lucas JacksonWASHINGTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Thursday it has opened two new special investigations into crashes involving Tesla (TSLA.O) vehicles where advanced driver assistance systems are suspected to have been in use.
Since 2016, NHTSA has opened 41 special crash investigations involving Tesla vehicles and where advanced driver assistance systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used, including eight investigations in 2022.
But Tesla's advanced driver assistance systems - and Musk's claims about them - face growing legal, regulatory and public scrutiny.
In June, NHTSA upgraded its defect probe into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with Autopilot and involving crashes with parked emergency vehicles, a required step before it could seek a possible recall.

     Summary: On Dec. 1, Tesla started offering a $3,750 "credit" on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles delivered before the end of the year.
It also recently started offering free supercharging for 10,000 miles (16,093 kms) for vehicles delivered in December.
The rare discounts follow a series of price hikes over the past couple of years by Tesla, which blamed supply chain disruption and inflation.
A Tesla Model 3 is seen in a showroom in Los Angeles, California U.S. January 12, 2018.
Tesla is also offering a $5,000 credit in Canada on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles delivered before the end of the year.

     ‘Disaster Of Epic Proportions’: Tesla Slides 9% As Demand Worries Pile Onto Concerns About Musk’s Twitter Focus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: VCG via Getty ImagesKey FactsIt’s the third-worst day for Tesla stock of 2022, sending the company’s market capitalization to $393 billion, nearly 70% off of its $1.2 trillion mark in January.
Concerns about easing demand for Tesla cars following its latest price cuts are “the straw that broke the camel’s back” for Tesla stock, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Forbes, adding the latest worries are “pouring gasoline on the raging fire” on Tesla shares.
The only worse days for Tesla stock in 2022 were January 27 and April 26, the day after Twitter agreed to Musk’s takeover bid.
Responding to an investor suggesting Tesla essentially now has “no CEO,” Musk explained the decline in Tesla stock was simply due to the historic inverse relationship between equity prices and interest rates.
Crucial Quote“The Musk-driven fiasco is a disaster of epic proportions with Tesla and Twitter in a spider web,” Ives said Thursday.

     Tesla’s $7,500 discount feels desperate, and it’s giving investors the ick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now with a week left in the month, the electric vehicle maker has upped that discount to $7,500, according to the company’s website.
After the news of the discount and other offers designed to increase sales in the fourth quarter, Tesla’s stock dropped another 9% and is trading at $125.12 at market close on Wednesday.
It seems Tesla is getting a little too thirsty for end-of-year sales and it’s giving investors the ick.
That would mean 1,404,333 deliveries for the year, so Tesla has to hit 495,760 deliveries in Q4 to achieve that.
Investors are taking the discounts on Tesla’s already most popular and lower-priced vehicles as a sign that there’s less demand for the vehicles.

     Tesla Offers Rare Year-End Discounts on 2 Top-Selling Models
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla Inc. is offering rare discounts through year’s end on its two top-selling models, an indication that demand is slowing for its electric vehicles.
The move comes ahead of a new federal tax credit of up to $7,500 that’s scheduled to take effect Jan. 1.
Teslas weren’t eligible for a previous federal tax credit program because the company had reached a limit of 200,000 vehicles sold.
On the company’s third-quarter earnings conference call in October, Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said Tesla will fall just short of its 50% sales growth target.
To reach the 50% sales growth target, Tesla must have a stellar performance in the fourth quarter.

Musk has sold Tesla shares in the past to help cover his deal to buy Twitter, telling the platform's employees last month he did so to "save" the company.
