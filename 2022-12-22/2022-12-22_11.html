     Eagles' Jalen Hurts out vs. Cowboys; Gardner Minshew to start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eagles coach Nick Sirianni says it looks like Gardner Minshew will get the start Saturday vs. the Cowboys.
(1:05)PHILADELPHIA -- Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts will miss Saturday's game against the Dallas Cowboys with a right shoulder sprain, meaning Gardner Minshew will get the start in a game that could secure the NFC East title and the No.
"Jalen did everything he possibly could to get his body ready to go," coach Nick Sirianni said Thursday.
"Gardner will be our guy and Gardner will be ready," Sirianni said.
Minshew has performed well in spot duty for the Eagles before, going 20-of-25 and throwing a pair of touchdowns for an injured Hurts last December against the Jets.

He'll be the quarterback the Eagles know he is, and that's plenty good enough to win important games.
