     Conservatives slammed Biden's joint press conference with Zelenskyy: 'No more money to Ukraine!'

     Summary: Conservatives lawmakers and activists responded to President Biden's joint press conference with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Wednesday by saying the United States should stop sending money to the war-torn country.
During the press conference, Biden reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to provide aid to Ukraine in its efforts to maintain its national sovereignty.
PRESIDENT BIDEN TELLS ZELENSKYY HE WAS NAMED TIME'S ‘MAN OF THE YEAR’ DURING WHITE HOUSE VISIT"No more money to Ukraine!!!
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., tweeted, "Why is Ukraine funding buried in the bill that averts a shutdown of our own government?
Zelenskyy made a direct appeal to Republicans hesitant to continue funding Ukraine, arguing that Ukraine's independence is essential to global security.

     5 Key Moments From Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Visit to DC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zelenskyy’s trademark humility and humor was in evidence, but these attributes did not lessen the severity of his message during his first trip abroad since Russia invaded Ukraine.
He participated in a flag exchangeZelenskyy gave House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris a Ukrainian flag signed by soldiers on the front lines, which was unfurled behind him for the remainder of his address to Congress.
In turn, Pelosi and Harris presented Zelenskyy with the American flag that had flown over the Capitol on Wednesday.
He reminded Congress that aid to Ukraine “is not charity”“Your money is not charity.
Congress has broadly supported providing aid to Ukraine, but additional funds—almost $50 billion included in an omnibus spending bill—have been stalled in Congress.

     Meet M-TAC, the maker of​ President Volodymyr​ Zelenskyy's casual sweaters and t-shirts that started out selling airsoft guns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: M-TAC launched in 2005 selling airsoft guns and accessories and started a clothing brand in 2014.
An M-TAC manager previously told Insider that Zelenskyy's olive green fleece was out of stock.
Per the company's website, M-TAC has more than 50 suppliers in 15 countries of the world.
Since Russia first invaded Ukraine, M-TAC has seen demand soar for Zelenskyy's fleece jacket, Taras Rudnytskyi, the Ukrainian manager of US operations for the company, previously told Insider.
"We hope to restock it someday, maybe after our victory," Rudnytskyi told Insider in May, adding that hostilities have made it difficult to continue any type of production.

     Zelenskyy's Surprise Visit to DC Was Months in the Making
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The trip could happen now, the Ukrainian leader said, because "we controlled the situation and ... first of all, because of your support."
The White House didn't publicly announce the impending Zelenskyy visit until 1 a.m. Wednesday — waiting until they felt Zelenskyy was safely out of Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Pelosi had been planting the seeds for months for a Zelenskyy address to Congress.
Before he left Ukraine, there were clues in Zelenskyy's own words that a surprise trip abroad could be in the works.
In a visit Tuesday to Bakhmut, located in Ukraine's contested Donetsk province, Zelenskyy was handed a Ukrainian flag.

     Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Military Attire at the White House Draws Comparisons to Winston Churchill
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is being hailed for his live address to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday — a moment that's drawing comparisons to Winston Churchill for, among other things, what he wore.
Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesAs Fox News host Bret Baier noted in an op-ed for the network, the parallels between Churchill and Zelenskyy are notable.
"Churchill was virtually alone in the world against Hitler, even as bombs were falling nightly on his cities," Baier continued.
"Zelenskyy wasn't expected to survive a week after the Russian invasion, much less nearly 10 months and counting."
"We will fight till the end, at sea, in the air," Zelenskyy said, echoing a speech Churchill gave in 1940.

     Summary: Zelenskyy was at the top of the news Wednesday with a hastily announced visit to the White House and Congress.
All of this played out before Zelenskyy traveled to a joint session of Congress where he again pleaded his case.
Still, none of this seemed to fully explain why Zelenskyy chose Wednesday as a day to visit.
At the end of the day Zelenskyy, still dressed in his war uniform, as he had been all day, heard bipartisan cheers as he spoke to Congress.
As it turns out, the reason for Zelenskyy's visit was as deep as this: The medium is the message.
