     FTX co-founder Gary Wang and Alameda’s Caroline Ellison plead guilty to criminal charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Southern District of New York attorney Damian Williams announced the charges at a press event last week, he noted that his office was “not done” in terms of levying additional charges, and now we know Ellison and Wang were at least some of the individuals he was referring to at the time.
Ellison and Wang are likely to be key witnesses for the feds in the SBF case, given that they are most likely to have direct and best knowledge that SBF knew about the use of FTX customer funds to cover Alameda’s risky crypto trading bets.
This might not be the end of charges for individuals at FTX and Alameda, either.
Williams reiterated at the press conference announcing the charges against Ellison and Wang that if anyone else is considering coming forward to assist authorities in their prosecution of the case in exchange for possible leniency, now is the time.
Both Ellison and Wang also face civil penalties from the SEC and CFTC, announced alongside the criminal charges.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried is headed to his parents’ home in Silicon Valley after being released on $250 million bail yesterday.
The former FTX CEO will be under house arrest while he awaits trial for fraud—including allegations that he moved customer funds from the crypto exchange into his other company, a crypto hedge fund called Alameda Research.
Caroline Ellison, the 28-year-old former CEO of Alameda, pleaded guilty for her role in the massive grift this week, attempting to minimize her punishment in exchange for her full cooperation with SBF’s prosecutors.
Ellison is quite the characterSince the implosion of FTX, Ellison has fascinated internet sleuths due to her academic background, quirky personality traits, and the tome of Tumblr blogs she’s apparently written.
SBF left to start Alameda Research and later asked Ellison to join him at the then-startup.

Manhattan US Attorney Damian Williams announced Wednesday math whizz and Harry Potter fan Ellison and Gary Wang, a co-founder of FTX had pleaded guilty to fraud.
Because both employees and key members of his inner circle turned on him, “there’s no easy path here,” said Sharman.
Now, Bankman-Fried appears to be the federal government’s main target.
Weinstein said if Bankman-Fried was his client, he’d press him on what Ellison and Wang might be telling prosecutors.
