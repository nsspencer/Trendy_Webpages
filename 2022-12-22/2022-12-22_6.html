His first came last season, five catches, 95 yards and two scores in the Bengals' 24-21 home win over ... the Jaguars.
Mosley and Quincy Williams — The 'backers will be front and center.
Mosley's on another 160-tackle tear and Williams is again leading the Jets in tackles for loss/no gain (11.0).
Mosley had a 28-yard strip — one of the longest sacks in Jets history — of Lawrence last season.

     Summary: Sign up for our amNY Sports email newsletter to get insights and game coverage for your favorite teamsThe Jets will take on the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday night at MetLife Stadium — and the weather forecast may play a major role in the game.
The extreme weather will certainly put more of an onus on the running game for both offenses.
Allowing just 1,561 yards on the ground, the Jets have allowed just the 11th-most rushing yards of any team in the NFL.
The Jets are on the outside-looking-in with regards to the AFC playoff picture, but they still have a chance.
They’re going to need a victory if they want to keep their postseason dreams alive.

     Ten things: Jaguars-Jets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the Jaguars – four games out of first place at midseason and seemingly out of postseason contention – control their playoff destiny with three games remaining in the 2022 regular season.
The Jaguars (6-8), winners of two consecutive games and four of six, will play the New York Jets (7-7) at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., Thursday at 8:15 p.m.
The Jaguars enter their lone scheduled prime-time game of the season one game behind the AFC South-leading Tennessee Titans (7-7), who have lost four consecutive games after a 7-3 start.
The scenario is simple because they beat the Titans in Nashville, Tenn., in Week 14.
That means if the teams finish tied for first and the Jaguars beat the Titans in the regular-season finale in Week 18, the Jaguars will win the South based on a head-to-head sweep.

     Summary: Thursday night's matchup between the New York Jets and the Jacksonville Jaguars won't answer the most pressing question on all of our minds ("Who would win in an actual fight between a jet and a jaguar?
The Jets are a game behind in the wild-card race, while Tennessee's tailspin has allowed the Jags to inch within a game of the AFC South leader.
The second-year QB ranks last in the NFL in completion percentage (60%) and rarely targets his running backs for gimme completions (2.9 completions per game).
Jamal Agnew over 8.5 receiving yards (-115)If you squint while watching Jags games, Agnew is like a light version of Deebo Samuel.

     Summary: To learn more about New York ahead of the matchup, we spoke with MacGregor Wells of Gang Green Nation — SB Nation’s home for all things Jets.
What is the Zach Wilson experience like for Jets fans?
MacGregor: For the large majority of his brief NFL career, Zach Wilson has not operated at the level of a competent NFL quarterback.
Star receivers are routinely limited against the Jets, and almost no quarterbacks have had a big day against the Jets all year.

     Jets can keep playoff dream alive by learning valuable lesson from painful slump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Jets have spent the last three months proving they’re good enough to play with any team in the NFL.
“We understand the way things shake out as far as the playoff standings.”“Everyone knows that we’ve got to win out,” Jets coach Robert Saleh said.
It felt like a move that might save the Jets’ season, especially after the White-led Jets cruised to a victory over the Bears the next week.
Against the Bills, the Jets were already at a disadvantage facing a more talented team that was also looking for revenge on its home field after the Jets’ win a few weeks earlier.
This year, the Jets have shown an ability to stay in games, and earlier this season they proved they could win those close games.
