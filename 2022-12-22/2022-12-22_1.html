     Jets HC Robert Saleh says 'we haven't seen the last of' Zach Wilson despite Thursday night benching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jets quarterback Zach Wilson was benched in favor of Chris Streveler near the end of the third quarter of New York's 19-3 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday night.
2 overall pick's two-season tenure for the Jets, whose playoff hopes were dealt a massive blow with their fourth consecutive loss.
The former CFL quarterback went 10 for 15 for 90 yards, also contributing 54 yards on the ground.
None of Streveler's three drives ended in points, but his numbers nevertheless were significantly better than Wilson's even with less playing time.
Wilson was bombarded by boos from the Jets fans at every wrong turn on Thursday until he was pulled.

     Summary: The Jaguars are winners of each of their last three thanks to a Thursday Night Football victory over the Jets.
