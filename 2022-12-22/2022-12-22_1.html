     Slumping Celtics can’t rally past Pacers after falling behind by 30
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — Tyrese Haliburton scored 33 points and the Indiana Pacers opened a 30-point lead in the first half before holding off the slumping Boston Celtics 117-112 on Wednesday night.
Former Celtics player Celtic Aaron Nesmith had 15 points, Chris Duarte added 14 and Myles Turner had 10 to help the Pacers win for the fourth time in five games.
Jayson Tatum led Boston with 41 points after missing a game because of personal reasons, while point guard Marcus Smart sat out with a non-COVID illness.
Coming off consecutive home loss to Orlando, the Celtics fell behind by 30 points late in the second quarter before Tatum carried them back into it.
Tatum’s 3-pointer from the right wing cut Boston’s deficit to seven points midway into the final quarter.

     Pacers' Andrew Nembhard: Quiet night against Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nembhard racked up eight points (4-9 FG, 0-1 3Pt), five rebounds, five assists, one block and one steal over 34 minutes during Wednesday's 117-112 win over Boston.
The rookie looked good early after being re-inserted into the starting lineup at the end of November and popped for 31 points against the Warriors on Dec. 5, but since then Nembhard's contributions have dwindled and he's scored in single digits in seven of the last eight games, averaging just 7.3 points, 3.4 boards, 3.1 assists and 1.1 steals over that stretch.
The Pacers seem to prefer having Bennedict Mathurin anchor their second-unit scoring, but with Chris Duarte now healthy, Nembhard may have to pick up the pace to keep his spot in the starting five.

     Lack of effort plagues Celtics in loss to Pacers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s normal for effort level to wax and wane throughout an NBA season.
If, ever, there was a time for the Celtics to bring a high effort level to a regular season game, it was Wednesday night’s matchup against the Pacers.
On this play, White, Tatum and Brown show zero desire to put a body on Hield, even though he’s in very solid rebounding position.
I’m not trying to erase your memory or tell you that the effort level actually wasn’t that bad – that would be out of touch and flat-out false.
And, when the Celtics get out of this shooting slump (which they will, I promise), their effort level is bound to improve, too.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pacers led by 28 points at halftime and held off a furious Boston comeback that included a 42-point third quarter.
Two Williams dunks brought Boston within 33-19, but Indiana hit three more threes — including one by Duarte with 2.7 seconds left — by quarter’s end.
Tatum hit two 3-pointers off offensive rebounds to cut Boston’s deficit to 106-99 midway through the fourth.
Boston was within five with 3:06 to go, but a 6-0 Indiana run followed.
Tatum scored six straight in the last 2:01 to slice into the final margin.

     Celtics Unable to Lean on Defense to Beat Pacers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pacers scored 42 points in the first quarter and flummoxed the Celtics defense Joe Mazzulla believed entered the game overlooked.
On offense, the Celtics shot 6-for-18 at the rim as the Pacers followed the lead of recent teams that cut off Boston’s rim access.
The game also took on a feel of a 2021-22 early season second half cram session.
The Celtics, Tatum believes, can restore their defensive identity and lean on that end through bad shooting with an earlier effort.
“The first half (effort) wasn’t (there), the second half you seen us lock in, it’s tough,” Tatum told CLNS.

     7 takeaways as slumping Celtics rally from 30-point deficit but drop 3rd straight to Pacers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celtics 7 takeaways as slumping Celtics rally from 30-point deficit but drop 3rd straight to Pacers "We’ve had a tough stretch every year since I’ve been in the NBA, and this is no different."
Jayson Tatum scored 41 points but the Celtics fell to the Pacers on Wednesday.
Hold your applause for the Celtics’ second-half rally, and consider shelving your rage at the officials.
Advertisement:A 20-point rally is fairly common at this point, but to rally from a 30-point deficit, you need to be both lucky and good.
It’s a credit to the Celtics that they managed to rally despite the Pacers’ 8-for-18 (44.4 percent) shooting in the second half.
