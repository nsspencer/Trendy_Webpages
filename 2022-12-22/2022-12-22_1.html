     Summary: Chris Streveler replaced Wilson before the fourth quarter, finishing with a team-high 54 rushing yards and 90 passing yards.
There isn’t much positive to come out of this game — the offense, defense, special teams and coaching all had their issues.
Against two of the worst defenses statistically in the NFL (Lions and Jaguars), Wilson didn’t even look like he belonged on the field.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jets quarterback Zach Wilson was benched in favor of Chris Streveler near the end of the third quarter of New York's 19-3 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday night.
Wilson was making his second straight start, after previously being replaced by QB Mike White after a disappointing 10-3 loss to the Patriots in Week 11.
Wilson again started Thursday night versus the Jaguars, but unfortunately, the second-year QB didn't start the game off strong, going 9 for 18 for 92 yards passing and an interception before the Jets decided to bring in Streveler.
2 overall pick, was bombarded by boos by the Jets fanbase at every wrong turn on Thursday.
He was 3 for 5 for 41 yards passing, along with 37 yards rushing, on the drive.
