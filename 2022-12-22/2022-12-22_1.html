     Jets' Zach Wilson pulled as Chris Streveler gives 'spark' in loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a subpar first half, Zach Wilson and the Jets get booed off the field by their hometown fans.
In came Streveler, who had been elevated from the practice squad only hours before the game.
Streveler came in, he ran a couple of plays, sparked the offense and got the explosive play.
The rain-soaked crowd roared when Streveler came in, and the fans loved his gritty, improvisational style.
The Jets activated three quarterbacks for the first time, with Streveler and Joe Flacco backing up Wilson.

     Summary: On the ensuing drive, the Stanford product had consecutive QB hits on Lawrence.
"That whole first half in all three phases, we just couldn't get the rhythm," HC Robert Saleh said.
In the second half, the defense allowed 115 of Jacksonville's 365 yards and two field goals.
The Green &amp; White finished with 6 QB hits including DL Micheal Clemons' thundering third-down pop on Lawrence and 4 TFL.
"The defense responded in the second half," Saleh said.

     Staying alive: Jaguars knock off Jets, still in playoff chase
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Lawrence and the offense did enough to move the ball and put points on the board against a tough New York defense, it was Jacksonville’s defense that took control.
The Jaguars visit the Texans in Week 17 and then wraps things up at home against Tennessee on Jan. 8.
Wilson has struggled in the NFL, but the Jaguars defense made his night miserable.
Trailing 16-3, the Jets pulled him for Streveler late in the third quarter but that didn’t do much for the Jets.
Streveler led the Jets to the Jaguars 13 early in the final quarter but turned it over on downs.

     Summary: The Jets were allowing 299.1 yards per game, and the Jaguars nearly reached that by halftime (251 yards).
The Jaguars finished with 368 yards, the second-most yards the Jets have allowed all season.
The Jaguars and Titans end the regular season in Jacksonville in a game that could be for the division title and a playoff berth.
The Jaguars are now 6-2 in games this season in which they have a positive or even turnover ratio.
The Jets (7-8) all but ruined their playoff hopes with the loss, but the big story was Wilson's flameout.

     Jets HC Robert Saleh says 'we haven't seen the last of' Zach Wilson despite Thursday night benching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jets quarterback Zach Wilson was benched in favor of Chris Streveler near the end of the third quarter of New York's 19-3 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday night.
2 overall pick's two-season tenure for the Jets, whose playoff hopes were dealt a massive blow with their fourth consecutive loss.
The former CFL quarterback went 10 for 15 for 90 yards, also contributing 54 yards on the ground.
None of Streveler's three drives ended in points, but his numbers nevertheless were significantly better than Wilson's even with less playing time.
Wilson was bombarded by boos from the Jets fans at every wrong turn on Thursday until he was pulled.

     Who is Chris Streveler? A look at the Jets practice squad quarterback who replaced benched Zach Wilson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As boos rained down at MetLife Stadium, the Jets benched Zach Wilson for Chris Streveler in the midst of a 19-3 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday night.
The Jets quarterback situation has been a roller-coaster ride this season, with Wilson, Flacco, Mike White and now Streveler all getting playing time.
In February 2022, he signed with the Miami Dolphins practice squad, but was waived in May, paving his way to join the Jets.
Streveler was waived by the Jets in August 2022 and signed to the practice squad one day later, despite a stellar preseason.
During his time in the CFL, he had 19 touchdowns, 19 interceptions, 2,698 passing yards, along with 1,167 rushing touchdowns and 22 rushing touchdowns.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Regardless, quarterback Zach Wilson is already feeling like a stale, room-temperature cup of joe for the Jets.
And while Jets fans can be fickle and unforgiving, the Jets knew that when they used the second overall pick in 2021 to get him.
The Jets could have dangled the second overall pick to another team that loved Wilson, and the Jets could have gotten someone like, say, linebacker Micah Parsons.
Even if that triggers Wilson to reach his full potential elsewhere, it’s become obvious he’ll likely never realize it with the Jets.
