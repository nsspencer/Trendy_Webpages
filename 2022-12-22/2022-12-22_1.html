    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a subpar first half, Zach Wilson and the Jets get booed off the field by their hometown fans.
In came Streveler, who had been elevated from the practice squad only hours before the game.
Streveler came in, he ran a couple of plays, sparked the offense and got the explosive play.
The rain-soaked crowd roared when Streveler came in, and the fans loved his gritty, improvisational style.
The Jets activated three quarterbacks for the first time, with Streveler and Joe Flacco backing up Wilson.

     Jets HC Robert Saleh says 'we haven't seen the last of' Zach Wilson despite Thursday night benching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jets quarterback Zach Wilson was benched in favor of Chris Streveler near the end of the third quarter of New York's 19-3 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday night.
2 overall pick's two-season tenure for the Jets, whose playoff hopes were dealt a massive blow with their fourth consecutive loss.
The former CFL quarterback went 10 for 15 for 90 yards, also contributing 54 yards on the ground.
None of Streveler's three drives ended in points, but his numbers nevertheless were significantly better than Wilson's even with less playing time.
Wilson was bombarded by boos from the Jets fans at every wrong turn on Thursday until he was pulled.

     Summary: The Jets were allowing 299.1 yards per game, and the Jaguars nearly reached that by halftime (251 yards).
The Jaguars finished with 368 yards, the second-most yards the Jets have allowed all season.

The Jaguars are now 6-2 in games this season in which they have a positive or even turnover ratio.
The Jets (7-8) all but ruined their playoff hopes with the loss, but the big story was Wilson's flameout.

     Summary: pic.twitter.com/z6G2fwTRkZ — New York Jets (@nyjets) December 23, 2022While Lawrence sliced through the Jets' normally strong defense, Wilson couldn't get anything going and was booed frequently -- all the way to the bench.
Things actually got off to a promising start for the Jets when Quinnen Williams strip-sacked Lawrence on the Jaguars' third play from scrimmage.
But the Jets couldn't get into the end zone and settled for a 37-yard field goal from Greg Zuerlein after Andre Cisco sacked Wilson on a safety blitz on third down.
On fourth-and-4, Streveler completed a 4-yard pass to Garrett Wilson and he led the Jets to the Jaguars 13.
Instead, Lawrence, who lost 26-21 to Wilson and the Jets last season, and the Jaguars maintained control.

     Summary: When New York Jets quarterback Zach Wilson heaved a ball downfield at the end of the first half and saw it intercepted by the Jacksonville Jaguars, MetLife Stadium erupted in the most deafening display of boos on Thursday night.
"You don’t blame them," Wilson told reporters post-game when asked about the fan's booing after he threw for 92 yards on 9 of 18 passing.
Yet, with those stakes in mind, and Wilson the Jets' No.
JETS BENCH ZACH WILSON DURING THIRD QUARTER AGAINST JAGUARS AFTER ANOTHER POOR PERFORMANCE"I just felt like I didn't have any rhythm out there," he explained.
No matter the case, Saleh's comments would indicate the Jets are confident Wilson can get his rhythm going.

     Summary: The Jaguars are winners of each of their last three thanks to a Thursday Night Football victory over the Jets.
On a night where the rowdy New York Jets crowd was vehemently denying their second-year quarterback, the Jacksonville Jaguars saw a very different game play out as they continued their playoff push.
After forcing a Jets punt thanks to solid coverage downfield and pressure on Wilson, the Jaguars managed to get back into scoring range.
With 280 total yards, Lawrence (4,039) eclipsed 4,000 for the first time in his NFL career.
With 83 rushing yards, Travis Etienne (1,000) reached 1,000 for the 2022 season.

     Summary: Wilson's poor performance has Jets in quite a QB quandary New York Jets quarterback Zach Wilson (2) passes against the Jacksonville Jaguars during the first quarter of an NFL football game, Thursday, Dec. 22, 2022, in East Rutherford, N.J. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) The frustrated, rain-soaked New York Jets fans were flat-out tired.
The booing of Zach Wilson began in the first quarter and got louder just before at halftime when his desperation throw was intercepted.
The fans had seen enough late in the third quarter, and Robert Saleh and the Jets knew they needed to do something.
''We were trying to change up to get the run game going,'' Saleh said, refusing to call it a benching.
And the Jets are left with one massive question when it comes to their quarterback situation: Now what?

     Summary: With their win over the Jets, the Jaguars will be in first place and hold the No.
The hay is not yet in the barn, of course, and the Jaguars still must face the Titans in Week 18.
If Pederson isn’t a top-three Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year candidate, what are we even doing with that award?
NFL Research: On Thursday, Travis Etienne became the fifth player in Jaguars franchise history to reach the 1,000-yard rushing mark for a season.
The others: Fred Taylor, Maurice Jones-Drew, Leonard Fournette and James Robinson, whom the Jaguars traded to the Jets earlier this season (Robinson was inactive Thursday).
