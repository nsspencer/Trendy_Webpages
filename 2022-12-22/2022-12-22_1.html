     Keegan Murray's confidence shines in career scoring night vs. Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Keegan Murray's rookie NBA season has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride with plenty of peaks and valleys.
"There's going to be ups and downs; I think Keegan start off the year great, obviously," Kevin Huerter told reporters postgame after the win over the Lakers.
I think he's taking shots with confidence, getting in the paint defensively.
Obviously, he's going to continue to learn, but as long as he's playing confident out there, he'll be fine."
On "Kings Postgame Live," NBC Sports California's Matt Barnes echoed those remarks by stating that the Kings rookie shouldn't be discouraged by missed 3-pointers.

     Lakers News: Emmy Winner Posts Sneak Peak From Set Of "Winning Time" Season 2

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Also pictured is the show's lead, John C. Reilly, who portrays former Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss.
They're pictured on a green-screened set, in front of players wearing classic early-1980s Lakers warmup sweats.
Auerbach is a more peripheral figure in the show's 10-episode first season.
The first season details the team's entire 1979-80 season, during which Dr. Buss wasn't the only Laker rookie of consequence.
He and reigning All-Star center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Solomon Hughes) joined forces to lead the Lakers to the 1980 NBA title in a six-game defeat of the Philadelphia 76ers.
