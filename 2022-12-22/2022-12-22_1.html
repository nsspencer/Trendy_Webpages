    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a subpar first half, Zach Wilson and the Jets get booed off the field by their hometown fans.
In came Streveler, who had been elevated from the practice squad only hours before the game.
Streveler came in, he ran a couple of plays, sparked the offense and got the explosive play.
The rain-soaked crowd roared when Streveler came in, and the fans loved his gritty, improvisational style.
The Jets activated three quarterbacks for the first time, with Streveler and Joe Flacco backing up Wilson.

     Jets HC Robert Saleh says 'we haven't seen the last of' Zach Wilson despite Thursday night benching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jets quarterback Zach Wilson was benched in favor of Chris Streveler near the end of the third quarter of New York's 19-3 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday night.
2 overall pick's two-season tenure for the Jets, whose playoff hopes were dealt a massive blow with their fourth consecutive loss.
The former CFL quarterback went 10 for 15 for 90 yards, also contributing 54 yards on the ground.
None of Streveler's three drives ended in points, but his numbers nevertheless were significantly better than Wilson's even with less playing time.
Wilson was bombarded by boos from the Jets fans at every wrong turn on Thursday until he was pulled.

    </h2>

     Summary: The Jets were allowing 299.1 yards per game, and the Jaguars nearly reached that by halftime (251 yards).
The Jaguars finished with 368 yards, the second-most yards the Jets have allowed all season.
The Jaguars and Titans end the regular season in Jacksonville in a game that could be for the division title and a playoff berth.
The Jaguars are now 6-2 in games this season in which they have a positive or even turnover ratio.
The Jets (7-8) all but ruined their playoff hopes with the loss, but the big story was Wilson's flameout.

     Jaguars roll Jets with ease as Zach Wilson struggles: Was that his final start with the Jets?

     Summary: Chris Streveler replaced Wilson before the fourth quarter, finishing with a team-high 54 rushing yards and 90 passing yards.
There isn’t much positive to come out of this game — the offense, defense, special teams and coaching all had their issues.
Against two of the worst defenses statistically in the NFL (Lions and Jaguars), Wilson didn’t even look like he belonged on the field.
Just 36 percent of the Jets’ offensive plays were deemed successful, and just 24 percent of Zach Wilson passing plays.
— MockHighlight of the gameKey statThursday night marked Wilson’s fourth career start that ended with fewer than 10 completions and fewer than 100 passing yards.

    </h2>

     Summary: With their win over the Jets, the Jaguars will be in first place and hold the No.
The hay is not yet in the barn, of course, and the Jaguars still must face the Titans in Week 18.
If Pederson isn’t a top-three Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year candidate, what are we even doing with that award?
NFL Research: On Thursday, Travis Etienne became the fifth player in Jaguars franchise history to reach the 1,000-yard rushing mark for a season.
The others: Fred Taylor, Maurice Jones-Drew, Leonard Fournette and James Robinson, whom the Jaguars traded to the Jets earlier this season (Robinson was inactive Thursday).

     Jets’ Zach Wilson era is over after loss to Jags, no matter what Robert Saleh says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fans braved the pouring rain and harsh winds to sit at MetLife, a few nights before Christmas, to watch the Jets’ season go up in flames, their playoff hopes evaporating after a 19-3 loss.
The moment Robert Saleh benched him for a practice squad player on Thursday night, the coach gave up on any hope that Wilson might become the quarterback the Jets need.
The Jets’ offense has looked better with Mike White, Joe Flacco and, last year, Josh Johnson.
“Yeah, it is” hard, Wilson said.
You just say, ‘Why are we not moving the ball?’ And that starts with me.”AdvertisementThe moment Saleh pulled Wilson for Streveler, any hope of Wilson becoming the franchise quarterback the Jets thought they were drafting disappeared.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Regardless, quarterback Zach Wilson is already feeling like a stale, room-temperature cup of joe for the Jets.
And while Jets fans can be fickle and unforgiving, the Jets knew that when they used the second overall pick in 2021 to get him.
The Jets could have dangled the second overall pick to another team that loved Wilson, and the Jets could have gotten someone like, say, linebacker Micah Parsons.
Even if that triggers Wilson to reach his full potential elsewhere, it’s become obvious he’ll likely never realize it with the Jets.
