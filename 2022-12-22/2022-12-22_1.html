     Ten things: Jaguars-Jets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the Jaguars – four games out of first place at midseason and seemingly out of postseason contention – control their playoff destiny with three games remaining in the 2022 regular season.
The Jaguars (6-8), winners of two consecutive games and four of six, will play the New York Jets (7-7) at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., Thursday at 8:15 p.m.
The Jaguars enter their lone scheduled prime-time game of the season one game behind the AFC South-leading Tennessee Titans (7-7), who have lost four consecutive games after a 7-3 start.
The scenario is simple because they beat the Titans in Nashville, Tenn., in Week 14.
That means if the teams finish tied for first and the Jaguars beat the Titans in the regular-season finale in Week 18, the Jaguars will win the South based on a head-to-head sweep.

     Jets Fans Remain Confident in the Face of a Three Game Losing Streak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Still, the team is exceeding expectations, and fans remain happy with the direction.
Each week we ask Jets fans for their opinion on the team.
The Jets have taken a frustrating path to get to their 7-7 record, but most Jets fans probably would have signed up for being .500 late in December with a chance to make the postseason.
Even after a frustrating loss to the Lions last week, 89 percent of Jets fans we polled are confident in the team’s direction.
Jets fans are also expecting a winning record to end the season.

     Summary: Also active for the Jets Thursday is DL Quinnen Williams, whose career-best and Pro Bowl season was interrupted for a game and a half with his calf pull at Buffalo.
Williams is back and ready to pick up where he left off with his personal bests of 11 sacks and 23 QB hits.
He and the Jets' front four will want to get into a "violent" rotation in trying to bring heat against Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence, who has turned the ball over 14 times this season, seven times by interception and seven by lost fumble.
Two key Jaguars declared out of this game with injuries: LT Cam Robinson, who had started every game this season and 58 of the last 61 games for the Jaguars, has been deactivated with a knee injury.

That helps explain the call-up again for Will Parks, who will get the start next to Jordan Whitehead.
RB James Robinson and TE Jeremy Ruckert are once again healthy scratches, meaning no revenge game for Robinson against the Jaguars.
This means the Jets are dressing three quarterbacks: Zach Wilson, Joe Flacco and Chris Streveler.

     Jets can keep playoff dream alive by learning valuable lesson from painful slump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Jets have spent the last three months proving they’re good enough to play with any team in the NFL.
“We understand the way things shake out as far as the playoff standings.”“Everyone knows that we’ve got to win out,” Jets coach Robert Saleh said.
It felt like a move that might save the Jets’ season, especially after the White-led Jets cruised to a victory over the Bears the next week.
Against the Bills, the Jets were already at a disadvantage facing a more talented team that was also looking for revenge on its home field after the Jets’ win a few weeks earlier.
This year, the Jets have shown an ability to stay in games, and earlier this season they proved they could win those close games.
