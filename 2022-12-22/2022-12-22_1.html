     Five key plays: Jaguars 19, Jets 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First, the defense allowed just a field goal after Lawrence's early fumble gave the Jets possession in point-blank range.
The Jaguars' defense forced punts on the three drives after the opening field goal and linebacker Devin Lloyd intercepted Wilson on the final play of the half.
That allowed the Jaguars to maintain control of the game's momentum and lead 13-3 at halftime.
The Jaguars for the game allowed 227 yards and 10 first downs playing without starting outside linebacker Travon Walker and starting tackle Foley Fatukasi.
But aside from the 96-yard second-quarter drive, the Jets' defense managed to hold the Jaguars' offense out of the end zone through the first three quarters.

     Jets coach Robert Saleh says 'we haven't seen the last of' Zach Wilson despite Thursday night benching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jets quarterback Zach Wilson was benched in favor of Chris Streveler near the end of the third quarter of New York's 19-3 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday night.
2 overall pick's two-season tenure for the Jets, whose playoff hopes were dealt a massive blow with their fourth consecutive loss.
Head coach Robert Saleh said after the game it won't be Wilson's last chapter with New York, despite a woeful performance drenched in boos that even the evening's steady downpour could not wash away.
The former CFL quarterback went 10 for 15 for 90 yards, also contributing 54 yards on the ground.
"By the time we got it back, again the same thing, we just said 'We're already here, let's just keep going with (Streveler).'"

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a subpar first half, Zach Wilson and the Jets get booed off the field by their hometown fans.
In came Streveler, who had been elevated from the practice squad only hours before the game.
Streveler came in, he ran a couple of plays, sparked the offense and got the explosive play.
The rain-soaked crowd roared when Streveler came in, and the fans loved his gritty, improvisational style.
The Jets activated three quarterbacks for the first time, with Streveler and Joe Flacco backing up Wilson.

     Zach Wilson: New York Jets quarterback booed off during defeat by Jacksonville Jaguars

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Quarterback Zach Wilson endured a torrid night before eventually being benched as the New York ​​Jets were beaten 19-3 by the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday.
Wilson was booed at different points throughout the game before being replaced by Chris Streveler in the third quarter after completing just nine of 18 passes for 92 yards.
“I don’t blame them,” Wilson told reporters when asked about fans booing.
2 overall draft pick in 2021, Wilson has struggled for form during his two seasons at the Jets.
I couldn’t get anything there.”Jets head coach Robert Saleh decided to replace Wilson with Streveler who had been elevated from the practice squad for Thursday’s game.

     Summary: With their win over the Jets, the Jaguars will be in first place and hold the No.
The hay is not yet in the barn, of course, and the Jaguars still must face the Titans in Week 18.
If Pederson isn’t a top-three Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year candidate, what are we even doing with that award?
NFL Research: On Thursday, Travis Etienne became the fifth player in Jaguars franchise history to reach the 1,000-yard rushing mark for a season.
The others: Fred Taylor, Maurice Jones-Drew, Leonard Fournette and James Robinson, whom the Jaguars traded to the Jets earlier this season (Robinson was inactive Thursday).

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fans braved the pouring rain and harsh winds to sit at MetLife, a few nights before Christmas, to watch the Jets’ season go up in flames, their playoff hopes evaporating after a 19-3 loss.
The moment Robert Saleh benched him for a practice squad player on Thursday night, the coach gave up on any hope that Wilson might become the quarterback the Jets need.
The Jets’ offense has looked better with Mike White, Joe Flacco and, last year, Josh Johnson.
“Yeah, it is” hard, Wilson said.
You just say, ‘Why are we not moving the ball?’ And that starts with me.”AdvertisementThe moment Saleh pulled Wilson for Streveler, any hope of Wilson becoming the franchise quarterback the Jets thought they were drafting disappeared.

     Summary: Wilson was benched in the third quarter of a loss to the Jaguars on Thursday, another dscouraging performance from the former first-round pick.
We've got to find ways to help him, we've got to find ways to protect better, we've got to find better ways to run better, we've got to find better ways to call the game better.
The Jets' offensive line was as flimsy as ever against Jacksonville and the run game was nonexistent once again.
"We were trying to change it up to get the run game going," said Saleh.
"I feel like [Wilson] has gotten better," Saleh said.
