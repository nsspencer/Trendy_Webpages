    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the ensuing drive, the Stanford product had consecutive QB hits on Lawrence.
"That whole first half in all three phases, we just couldn't get the rhythm," HC Robert Saleh said.
In the second half, the defense allowed 115 of Jacksonville's 365 yards and two field goals.
The Green &amp; White finished with 6 QB hits including DL Micheal Clemons' thundering third-down pop on Lawrence and 4 TFL.
"The defense responded in the second half," Saleh said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a subpar first half, Zach Wilson and the Jets get booed off the field by their hometown fans.
In came Streveler, who had been elevated from the practice squad only hours before the game.
Streveler came in, he ran a couple of plays, sparked the offense and got the explosive play.
The rain-soaked crowd roared when Streveler came in, and the fans loved his gritty, improvisational style.
The Jets activated three quarterbacks for the first time, with Streveler and Joe Flacco backing up Wilson.

     Jets HC Robert Saleh says 'we haven't seen the last of' Zach Wilson despite Thursday night benching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jets quarterback Zach Wilson was benched in favor of Chris Streveler near the end of the third quarter of New York's 19-3 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday night.
2 overall pick's two-season tenure for the Jets, whose playoff hopes were dealt a massive blow with their fourth consecutive loss.
The former CFL quarterback went 10 for 15 for 90 yards, also contributing 54 yards on the ground.
None of Streveler's three drives ended in points, but his numbers nevertheless were significantly better than Wilson's even with less playing time.
Wilson was bombarded by boos from the Jets fans at every wrong turn on Thursday until he was pulled.

     Summary: With their win over the Jets, the Jaguars will be in first place and hold the No.
The hay is not yet in the barn, of course, and the Jaguars still must face the Titans in Week 18.
If Pederson isn’t a top-three Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year candidate, what are we even doing with that award?
NFL Research: On Thursday, Travis Etienne became the fifth player in Jaguars franchise history to reach the 1,000-yard rushing mark for a season.
The others: Fred Taylor, Maurice Jones-Drew, Leonard Fournette and James Robinson, whom the Jaguars traded to the Jets earlier this season (Robinson was inactive Thursday).

     Zach Wilson booed as Lawrence and Jaguars tame dismal Jets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The second matchup between last year’s first two draft picks – Lawrence at No 1 and Wilson No 2 – wasn’t even close.
While Lawrence sliced through the Jets’ normally strong defense, Wilson couldn’t get anything going and was booed frequently – all the way to the bench.
Wilson went 9 of 18 for 82 yards with an interception and a dismal 41.9 rating for the Jets (7-8), whose playoff hopes took a devastating hit with their fourth straight loss.
On fourth-and-4, Streveler completed a four-yard pass to Garrett Wilson and he led the Jets to the Jaguars 13.
Instead, Lawrence – who lost 26-21 to Wilson and the Jets last season – and the Jaguars maintained control.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The frustrated, rain-soaked New York Jets fans were flat-out tired.
The fans had seen enough late in the third quarter, and Robert Saleh and the Jets knew they needed to do something.
“We were trying to change up to get the run game going,” Saleh said, refusing to call it a benching.
That’s what has the Jets in a quarterback quandary.
The Jets will be in the market for a quarterback in the offseason, either to compete with Wilson or to replace him.

     Summary: Regardless, quarterback Zach Wilson is already feeling like a stale, room-temperature cup of joe for the Jets.
And while Jets fans can be fickle and unforgiving, the Jets knew that when they used the second overall pick in 2021 to get him.
The Jets could have dangled the second overall pick to another team that loved Wilson, and the Jets could have gotten someone like, say, linebacker Micah Parsons.
Even if that triggers Wilson to reach his full potential elsewhere, it’s become obvious he’ll likely never realize it with the Jets.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: National Football League Jaguars beat Jets with complete game, look like AFC South’s best team 7 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit linkThere was a time this season when the Jaguars couldn't be trusted.
Defensively, the Jaguars' dominance in Weeks 2 and 3 gave way to a porous unit that gave up lots of yards and couldn't get takeaways.
The Jaguars are currently just a half a game behind the division-leading Titans, pending the latter's Christmas Eve showdown against the Texans.
Jacksonville had 365 yards against a Jets defense that hadn't given up more than 360 since Week 2.
He previously worked for The Tennessean/USA TODAY Network, where he was the Titans beat writer for a year and a half.
