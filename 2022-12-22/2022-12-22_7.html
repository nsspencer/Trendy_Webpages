     Top Gun: Maverick was so good it killed China’s copy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The bad guys in Top Gun: Maverick may have been explicitly vague other people from some other place with some other ideology in an attempt to make sure the movie would still play in countries that Hollywood has… historically offended.
That mostly worked out, with the movie making a ton of money internationally, but it never did get a release in China for a few reasons.
But there was a problem: Maverick was really goddamn good, and Born To Fly, apparently, was not.
It’s like if Top Gun: Maverick made a big deal about how great Tim Cruise is, and then it didn’t even make Tim Cruise look very cool.
So, rather than risk any sort of embarrassment, the movie was canned.

     Top Gun: Maverick's Streaming Release Proves Your Final Concern Wrong
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the streaming release of Top Gun: Maverick will bring its extraordinary theater run to a close, it will also quell any fears about the Top Gun sequel’s re-watch potential.
However, Top Gun: Maverick is also simply a superb action movie that can hold up to re-watches.
However, the Top Gun: Maverick streaming release is also huge for Paramount+.
Whether this will be enough to see the Top Gun sequel succeed on streaming remains to be seen, but Top Gun: Maverick certainly isn’t hurt by the transition.

     'Top Gun: Maverick' Is Streaming Now on Paramount+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You can now feel the need for speed from the comfort of your own home, as Top Gun: Maverick, arguably the number one legacy sequel of 2022, is now available to stream globally on Paramount+ in time for the holidays.
The long-awaited follow-up to the 1986 classic Top Gun follows Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, played by Tom Cruise, over thirty years after the events of the first film.
Along with the new release to streaming, Paramount+ has also released a promo for the film's streaming debut that gives us a new look into the film that has inspired a whole new generation to sport mustaches and name their sons Maverick — or Goose, if they're really daring.
Featuring no shortage of exciting flight scenes and some emotional but stoic male-on-male bonding, Top Gun: Maverick is maybe the perfect movie to put on while trying to muster conversation with your emotionally distant father this Christmas.
Top Gun: Maverick is now available to stream on Paramount+, as well as being available on digital, DVD, and Blu-ray.

It was set to be the nation’s answer to the Top Gun sequel, which would be great because Top Gun: Maverick was never cleared for release in China.
Or, put another way: Top Gun: Maverick was too damn good.
It was made in cooperation with the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, just as Top Gun: Maverick was made with help from the U.S. Navy.
“It could come anytime,” they said, “or it might never come at all.”In the meantime, in the good ol’ U.S. of A., Top Gun: Maverick just hit Paramount+.

While Top Gun: Maverick beautifully concludes Maverick's story, there are still plenty of stories to explore in Top Gun 3.
While Maverick will probably still be in Top Gun 3, Top Gun: Maverick is clearly setting up his replacements.
Although Maverick eventually learns to forgive himself, another traumatic death occurs in his life by the end of Top Gun: Maverick: Iceman's death.
