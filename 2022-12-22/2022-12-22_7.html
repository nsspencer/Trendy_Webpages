     Weather to be a major factor as Jets take on Jaguars on Thursday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sign up for our amNY Sports email newsletter to get insights and game coverage for your favorite teamsThe Jets will take on the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday night at MetLife Stadium — and the weather forecast may play a major role in the game.
The extreme weather will certainly put more of an onus on the running game for both offenses.
Allowing just 1,561 yards on the ground, the Jets have allowed just the 11th-most rushing yards of any team in the NFL.
The Jets are on the outside-looking-in with regards to the AFC playoff picture, but they still have a chance.
They’re going to need a victory if they want to keep their postseason dreams alive.
