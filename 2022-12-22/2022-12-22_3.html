     Lakers: This Hall Of Fame Laker Is Santa's Favorite Scorer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Given that your Los Angeles Lakers are frequently featured on the NBA's marquee Christmas day scheduling, it may come as no surprise that a certain Laker superstar holds the record for most points scored on the holiday.
Per Game of Inches, 18-time All-Star shooting guard Kobe Bryant notched a whopping 395 points across his many Christmas day appearances.
Bryant's Lakers appeared in 18 Christmas day games over the course of his 20-season career, and he was healthy for 16 of the contests.
A terrific two-way perimeter force in his prime, Bryant was a 15-time All-NBA selection and a 12-time All-Defensive Teamer.
He led the Lakers to seven NBA Finals appearances, winning five titles and two Finals MVPs.

"The Lakers have had discussions for Detroit‚Äôs Bojan Bogdanovic, as well as the Knicks‚Äô Evan Fournier and Cam Reddish.

‚ÄúLaVine wants to go to the Lakers, that has been pretty clear for a while now.
‚ÄúThe problem on LaVine is from the Lakers‚Äô side, there is nothing they could trade to Chicago short of Anthony Davis,‚Äù the executive said.
‚ÄúNow, that is a possibility‚ÄîDavis is a Chicago guy and if he were going to leave the Lakers, the Bulls would be one of the few places he‚Äôd be OK with.

Of the regular rotation Lakers, Davis‚Äô on-court defensive rating differential is the highest: The Lakers‚Äô defensive rating improves by 7.1 when he‚Äôs on the floor, according to stat site Cleaning the Glass.
Davis‚Äô defensive rebounding in halfcourt possessions also significantly helps the Lakers avoid second-chance points (minus-5.9 points per 100 misses with putback opportunities when Davis is on the floor).
Defensively, the Lakers‚Äô have had the 25nd-ranked defense (119.6) over the last four games since Davis got hurt against Denver.

     Lakers News: Why L.A. Has Yet To Officially Diagnose Anthony Davis Foot Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anthony Davis has been unavailable to play for your Los Angeles Lakers with a loosely defined "right foot injury" since the second half of L.A.'s most impressive win of the season, a 126-108 drubbing of MVP candidate Nikola Jokic and his Denver Nuggets last Friday.
We know he's going to miss at least the next month's worth of games.
At the time Ham spoke on the issue yesterday, Davis had been through five days' worth of tests, without a definitive answer as to what was ailing.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still going through the evaluation process," Ham noted of Davis.
In the intervening few days, the team has gone 1-2 in its games without Davis, despite the solid play of backup big man Thomas Bryant in AD's absence.
