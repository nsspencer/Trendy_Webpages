     Lakers: This Hall Of Fame Laker Is Santa's Favorite Scorer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Given that your Los Angeles Lakers are frequently featured on the NBA's marquee Christmas day scheduling, it may come as no surprise that a certain Laker superstar holds the record for most points scored on the holiday.
Per Game of Inches, 18-time All-Star shooting guard Kobe Bryant notched a whopping 395 points across his many Christmas day appearances.
Bryant's Lakers appeared in 18 Christmas day games over the course of his 20-season career, and he was healthy for 16 of the contests.
A terrific two-way perimeter force in his prime, Bryant was a 15-time All-NBA selection and a 12-time All-Defensive Teamer.
He led the Lakers to seven NBA Finals appearances, winning five titles and two Finals MVPs.

     Lakers Rumors: L.A. Might Be Shifting Back Its Trade Timeline Yet Again - All Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alongside the injury issues, LeBron James only continues to get older and is still playing out of his mind.
Small improvements can come to aid the Davis injury but some win-now moves should be discussed.
Although trade speculations remain high, a chance of the Lakers doing a trade sometime before the end of the year seems highly unlikely so far.
Options continue to remain open but insiders suggest the team is looking to wait longer (via Jovan Buha, The Athletic).
There are exceptions, of course, and the Lakers hope to be one of them.”Patrick Beverley and Kendrick Nunn continue to be circulated in trade talks in hopes of adding some more depth, but in order to win-now the Lakers need to trade more assets.

     Summary: Through the first quarter, the Kings looked to be in a bit of a rush to find their offensive flow.
Their shots weren’t falling and everything started to look like a “here we go again” type of feel.
Domantas Sabonis (13 points, 21 rebounds and 12 assists) was a huge catalyst in helping the Kings head into the half with a 66-58 advantage.
Shots weren’t falling and they kept giving up a ton of easy baskets to the Lakers.
Reliable for the Kings as of late, as he would finish the night with 20 points and 8 rebounds.

     NBA trade rumors: Can Lakers land a “3-and-D” wing without giving up both first-round picks?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers don’t have a lot of assets to deal in the trade market, but they do hold two draft picks of significant interest.
Buha also reports the Lakers don’t want to sacrifice future assets because they don’t believe there is a trade that would make them a true contender.
That logic holds if the trade targets listed above are an exhaustive list.
Crowder has tanked his own trade value and might simply be too volatile to give up a future pick for.
Gordon and Richardson are fine targets but the Lakers will want something more for an unprotected future pick which could easily be in the top 3.

     Lakers Rumors: Executive Believes Bulls Guard Zach LaVine Wants To Join L.A.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers have been the most watched team in terms of those expected to make a deal ahead of the NBA trade deadline.
Most rumors surrounding the Lakers have said that the front office is expected to lean towards a smaller deal, unless a potential star becomes available and one name that fits that bill is Chicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine.
LaVine has blossomed into one of the best shooting guards in the league since joining Chicago, making back-to-back All-Star teams the last two seasons.
He is also represented by Klutch Sports, who the Lakers obviously have a great relationship with.

Anyway, let’s get down to the Lakers and the topic of conversation that’s most surrounding them.
It’s led to a pretty quiet trade market — some rumbling here or there about a deal without much action behind it.
The Times contacted rival executives to get a sense of whether they thought Davis’ injury would make the Lakers more aggressive on the trade market.
“Have to.”Another rival said that if negotiated properly, he felt the Davis injury could actually help the Lakers’ position in trade talks.
