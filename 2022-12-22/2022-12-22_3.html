     Jayson Tatum drops truth bomb on Celtics’ big issues during losing streak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Daniel Donabedian · 2 min readAfter holding the league’s best record for much of the 2022-23 season, the Boston Celtics have dropped three straight games at home and are 4-6 in their last 10 games.
While the C’s were bound to cool off after their red-hot start, they’ve suffered some rough losses as of late.
According to Celtics star Jayson Tatum, the team has to play like they’re having fun again.
“I think we’re playing a little timid, a little tight,” Tatum said, per The Athletic’s Jared Weiss.
If the Green Team can get back to playing more freely, they can perhaps snap the streak before falling too far in the standings.

The Celtics started flat -- losing the first quarter 42-22 -- and although they fought back, were never able to completely overcome the difficult loss.
After the Celtics fell to the Pacers, young star Jayson Tatum opened up about the defeat and also TD Garden reigning down boos on the squad throughout Wednesday's contest.

     Summary: BOSTON — Tyrese Haliburton scored 33 points and the Indiana Pacers opened a 30-point lead in the first half before holding off the slumping Boston Celtics 117-112 on Wednesday night.
Former Celtics player Celtic Aaron Nesmith had 15 points, Chris Duarte added 14 and Myles Turner had 10 to help the Pacers win for the fourth time in five games.
Jayson Tatum led Boston with 41 points after missing a game because of personal reasons, while point guard Marcus Smart sat out with a non-COVID illness.
Coming off consecutive home loss to Orlando, the Celtics fell behind by 30 points late in the second quarter before Tatum carried them back into it.
Tatum’s 3-pointer from the right wing cut Boston’s deficit to seven points midway into the final quarter.

     Summary: Heavy boos from the Garden crowd were heard for the first time all year towards the Celtics as the team dug itself a enormous first half hole.
Coming off two straight home losses to the Magic, Jayson Tatum acknowledged he thought the harsh treatment was deserved from the capacity crowd.
However, his running mates remain stuck in a malaise that’s carrying over to both ends of the floor at times.
Offensive woes carried over to the defensive end of the court, an that’s cause for concern according to Tatum.
“That would be more concerning if we didn’t play a completely different style in the second half.

“It would be concerning if we didn’t play a completely different style in the second half.
As Malcolm Brogdon put it after his former team manhandled the Celtics in the first half, it’s more disappointment than concern.
The breadth of the entire regular season still has Boston second in offense (116.5), now seventh in defense (110.6), and second in net rating (5.9) behind the Cavaliers (6.5).

Jayson Tatum scored 41 points but the Celtics fell to the Pacers on Wednesday.
Hold your applause for the Celtics’ second-half rally, and consider shelving your rage at the officials.
Advertisement:A 20-point rally is fairly common at this point, but to rally from a 30-point deficit, you need to be both lucky and good.
It’s a credit to the Celtics that they managed to rally despite the Pacers’ 8-for-18 (44.4 percent) shooting in the second half.

     Celtics Unable to Lean on Defense to Beat Pacers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pacers scored 42 points in the first quarter and flummoxed the Celtics defense Joe Mazzulla believed entered the game overlooked.
On offense, the Celtics shot 6-for-18 at the rim as the Pacers followed the lead of recent teams that cut off Boston’s rim access.
The game also took on a feel of a 2021-22 early season second half cram session.
The Celtics, Tatum believes, can restore their defensive identity and lean on that end through bad shooting with an earlier effort.
“The first half (effort) wasn’t (there), the second half you seen us lock in, it’s tough,” Tatum told CLNS.
