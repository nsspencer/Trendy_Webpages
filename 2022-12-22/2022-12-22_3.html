     Lakers: This Hall Of Fame Laker Is Santa's Favorite Scorer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Given that your Los Angeles Lakers are frequently featured on the NBA's marquee Christmas day scheduling, it may come as no surprise that a certain Laker superstar holds the record for most points scored on the holiday.
Per Game of Inches, 18-time All-Star shooting guard Kobe Bryant notched a whopping 395 points across his many Christmas day appearances.
Bryant's Lakers appeared in 18 Christmas day games over the course of his 20-season career, and he was healthy for 16 of the contests.
A terrific two-way perimeter force in his prime, Bryant was a 15-time All-NBA selection and a 12-time All-Defensive Teamer.
He led the Lakers to seven NBA Finals appearances, winning five titles and two Finals MVPs.

     Lakers News: Why L.A. Has Yet To Officially Diagnose Anthony Davis Foot Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Anthony Davis has been unavailable to play for your Los Angeles Lakers with a loosely defined "right foot injury" since the second half of L.A.'s most impressive win of the season, a 126-108 drubbing of MVP candidate Nikola Jokic and his Denver Nuggets last Friday.
We know he's going to miss at least the next month's worth of games.
At the time Ham spoke on the issue yesterday, Davis had been through five days' worth of tests, without a definitive answer as to what was ailing.
“He’s still going through the evaluation process," Ham noted of Davis.
In the intervening few days, the team has gone 1-2 in its games without Davis, despite the solid play of backup big man Thomas Bryant in AD's absence.

     Summary: The Chicago Bulls are having a season to forget, currently sitting 11th in the Eastern Conference with a 12-18 record.
Their two-time All Star wing Zach LaVine appears to be dissatisfied with the situation with an Eastern Conference executive telling NBA Insider Sean Deveney that the former UCLA star is keen to get to the Los Angeles Lakers.
“LaVine wants to go to the Lakers, that has been pretty clear for a while now.
“The problem on LaVine is from the Lakers’ side, there is nothing they could trade to Chicago short of Anthony Davis,” the executive said.
“Now, that is a possibility—Davis is a Chicago guy and if he were going to leave the Lakers, the Bulls would be one of the few places he’d be OK with.

     Summary: The Lakers currently sit at 13-18 as the 13th seed in the West, 2.5 games back of the 10th and final play-in spot.
"The Lakers have had discussions for Detroit’s Bojan Bogdanovic, as well as the Knicks’ Evan Fournier and Cam Reddish.
The trade for Hield and Turner will always be intriguing, as they would add the exact two pieces LA is missing — shooting and a defensive big.
The Lakers have their options, but the injury to AD definitely slowed things down a little bit.
However, with trade season almost upon us, we should expect the Lakers to be pretty active.

Domantas Sabonis (13 points, 21 rebounds and 12 assists) was a huge catalyst in helping the Kings head into the half with a 66-58 advantage.
Shots weren’t falling and they kept giving up a ton of easy baskets to the Lakers.

     RUMOR: Anthony Davis’ injury changes Lakers’ trade outlook, with 1 exception
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Quinn Allen · 2 min readThe Los Angeles Lakers were starting to play better not too long ago until Anthony Davis suffered a brutal foot injury.
Now, there’s concern he could miss the rest of the season, which has evidently changed the team’s outlook ahead of the trade deadline.
But with AD out now for the foreseeable future, the Lakers may stay relatively silent come February, with one exception.
The one exception is if a star that can grow alongside Davis over the next few years becomes available.”This definitely makes sense.
The Anthony Davis of the past was showing up for the Lakers, but then yet another injury came.

     Summary: I’m Dan Woike, and I apologize for the brief hiatus as I wrapped up a big Darvin Ham profile.
Anyway, let’s get down to the Lakers and the topic of conversation that’s most surrounding them.
It’s led to a pretty quiet trade market — some rumbling here or there about a deal without much action behind it.
The Times contacted rival executives to get a sense of whether they thought Davis’ injury would make the Lakers more aggressive on the trade market.
“Have to.”Another rival said that if negotiated properly, he felt the Davis injury could actually help the Lakers’ position in trade talks.

Trust in each other, trust in the system, trust in our teammates and have each others back.
