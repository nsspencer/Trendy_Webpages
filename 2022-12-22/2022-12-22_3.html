     Alice in Borderland: Season 2 – Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We continue from season 1 – but no recap!
Season 2 of Alice in Borderland does not open with a recap.
Season 1 premiered on Netflix in December of 2020, so it’s been a good two years.
However, despite Alice in Borderland season 2 not having a recap at the beginning, episode 1 of this second season does have a few flashbacks.
Actually, this is pretty smart in lieu of a recap; To remind us of the rules from season 1, but focus on the lack of rules in season 2.
