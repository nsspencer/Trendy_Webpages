     Summary: December 22, 2022 at 11:40 AM ESTPep Guardiola says that his reign at Manchester City will be “incomplete” if he does not win the Champions League while at the club.
The Spaniard won the trophy twice while at Barcelona, early in his managerial career, but he has failed to match that achievement at City, despite reaching the latter stages of the competition on each occasion.
“It’s not the only one but I admit it’s the trophy we want and my period here will not be complete if we don’t win it,” said Guardiola.
I will do everything in the time we have together to win it but I’d say the same before (signing).
“It’s the trophy we don’t have and we’ll try to do it.
