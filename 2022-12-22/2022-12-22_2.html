     Lakers News: Emmy Winner Posts Sneak Peak From Set Of "Winning Time" Season 2

     Summary: Also pictured is the show's lead, John C. Reilly, who portrays former Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss.
They're pictured on a green-screened set, in front of players wearing classic early-1980s Lakers warmup sweats.
Auerbach is a more peripheral figure in the show's 10-episode first season.
The first season details the team's entire 1979-80 season, during which Dr. Buss wasn't the only Laker rookie of consequence.
He and reigning All-Star center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Solomon Hughes) joined forces to lead the Lakers to the 1980 NBA title in a six-game defeat of the Philadelphia 76ers.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Keegan Murray's rookie NBA season has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride with plenty of peaks and valleys.
"There's going to be ups and downs; I think Keegan start off the year great, obviously," Kevin Huerter told reporters postgame after the win over the Lakers.
I think he's taking shots with confidence, getting in the paint defensively.
Obviously, he's going to continue to learn, but as long as he's playing confident out there, he'll be fine."
On "Kings Postgame Live," NBC Sports California's Matt Barnes echoed those remarks by stating that the Kings rookie shouldn't be discouraged by missed 3-pointers.

     Lakers News: Lonnie Walker IV Takes Accountability For Poor Defense Against Kings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a promising first quarter, the Los Angeles Lakers’ defense completely fell apart allowing back-to-back 40-point quarters to the Sacramento Kings in a 14-point loss.
And Lonnie Walker IV is accepting his part of the blame for the problems.
I feel like I’m not doing what I’m supposed to be doing on the defensive side so I gotta improve on that.
Trust in each other, trust in the system, trust in our teammates and have each others back.
For Walker and the rest of the Lakers, the energy and fight can not afford to waver in any way.

     Summary: Through the first quarter, the Kings looked to be in a bit of a rush to find their offensive flow.
Their shots weren’t falling and everything started to look like a “here we go again” type of feel.
Domantas Sabonis (13 points, 21 rebounds and 12 assists) was a huge catalyst in helping the Kings head into the half with a 66-58 advantage.
Shots weren’t falling and they kept giving up a ton of easy baskets to the Lakers.
Reliable for the Kings as of late, as he would finish the night with 20 points and 8 rebounds.

     NBA trade rumors: Can Lakers land a “3-and-D” wing without giving up both first-round picks?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers don’t have a lot of assets to deal in the trade market, but they do hold two draft picks of significant interest.
Buha also reports the Lakers don’t want to sacrifice future assets because they don’t believe there is a trade that would make them a true contender.
That logic holds if the trade targets listed above are an exhaustive list.
Crowder has tanked his own trade value and might simply be too volatile to give up a future pick for.
Gordon and Richardson are fine targets but the Lakers will want something more for an unprotected future pick which could easily be in the top 3.

Anyway, let’s get down to the Lakers and the topic of conversation that’s most surrounding them.
It’s led to a pretty quiet trade market — some rumbling here or there about a deal without much action behind it.
The Times contacted rival executives to get a sense of whether they thought Davis’ injury would make the Lakers more aggressive on the trade market.
“Have to.”Another rival said that if negotiated properly, he felt the Davis injury could actually help the Lakers’ position in trade talks.

Via Heavy.com:“LaVine wants to go to the Lakers, that has been pretty clear for a while now,” and Eastern Conference executive told Deveney.
“The problem on LaVine is from the Lakers’ side, there is nothing they could trade to Chicago short of Anthony Davis,” the executive said.
Furthermore, there would be another obstacle for the Lakers – the Bulls’ ownership reportedly doesn’t want to help the Lakers.
As one agent declared, “[Bulls chairperson Jerry] Reinsdorf isn’t helping the Lakers.” “‘If LaVine wants out, Reinsdorf and the Bulls have no obligation to honor any request.
