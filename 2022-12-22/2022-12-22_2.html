     Two Starters Return to Action for Jets' Rainy Thursday Night Game vs. Jaguars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Also active for the Jets Thursday is DL Quinnen Williams, whose career-best and Pro Bowl season was interrupted for a game and a half with his calf pull at Buffalo.
Williams is back and ready to pick up where he left off with his personal bests of 11 sacks and 23 QB hits.
He and the Jets' front four will want to get into a "violent" rotation in trying to bring heat against Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence, who has turned the ball over 14 times this season, seven times by interception and seven by lost fumble.
Two key Jaguars declared out of this game with injuries: LT Cam Robinson, who had started every game this season and 58 of the last 61 games for the Jaguars, has been deactivated with a knee injury.
These are the Jets' seven inactives:QB Mike WhiteWR Denzel MimsWR Jeff SmithRB James RobinsonCB Brandin EcholsS Lamarcus JoynerTE Jeremy RuckertAnd this is the Jags' seven-man inactive list:
