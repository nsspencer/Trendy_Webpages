Former Celtics player Celtic Aaron Nesmith had 15 points, Chris Duarte added 14 and Myles Turner had 10 to help the Pacers win for the fourth time in five games.
Jayson Tatum led Boston with 41 points after missing a game because of personal reasons, while point guard Marcus Smart sat out with a non-COVID illness.
Coming off consecutive home loss to Orlando, the Celtics fell behind by 30 points late in the second quarter before Tatum carried them back into it.
Tatum’s 3-pointer from the right wing cut Boston’s deficit to seven points midway into the final quarter.

     Summary: Heavy boos from the Garden crowd were heard for the first time all year towards the Celtics as the team dug itself a enormous first half hole.
Coming off two straight home losses to the Magic, Jayson Tatum acknowledged he thought the harsh treatment was deserved from the capacity crowd.
However, his running mates remain stuck in a malaise that’s carrying over to both ends of the floor at times.
Offensive woes carried over to the defensive end of the court, an that’s cause for concern according to Tatum.
“That would be more concerning if we didn’t play a completely different style in the second half.

    </h2>

     Summary: It’s normal for effort level to wax and wane throughout an NBA season.
If, ever, there was a time for the Celtics to bring a high effort level to a regular season game, it was Wednesday night’s matchup against the Pacers.
On this play, White, Tatum and Brown show zero desire to put a body on Hield, even though he’s in very solid rebounding position.
I’m not trying to erase your memory or tell you that the effort level actually wasn’t that bad – that would be out of touch and flat-out false.
And, when the Celtics get out of this shooting slump (which they will, I promise), their effort level is bound to improve, too.

Hold your applause for the Celtics’ second-half rally, and consider shelving your rage at the officials.
Advertisement:A 20-point rally is fairly common at this point, but to rally from a 30-point deficit, you need to be both lucky and good.
It’s a credit to the Celtics that they managed to rally despite the Pacers’ 8-for-18 (44.4 percent) shooting in the second half.
