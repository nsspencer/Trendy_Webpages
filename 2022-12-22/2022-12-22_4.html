     Summary: Heavy boos from the Garden crowd were heard for the first time all year towards the Celtics as the team dug itself a enormous first half hole.
Coming off two straight home losses to the Magic, Jayson Tatum acknowledged he thought the harsh treatment was deserved from the capacity crowd.
However, his running mates remain stuck in a malaise that’s carrying over to both ends of the floor at times.
Offensive woes carried over to the defensive end of the court, an that’s cause for concern according to Tatum.
“That would be more concerning if we didn’t play a completely different style in the second half.

But at least the Celtics flipped a switch.
“It would be concerning if we didn’t play a completely different style in the second half.
As Malcolm Brogdon put it after his former team manhandled the Celtics in the first half, it’s more disappointment than concern.
The breadth of the entire regular season still has Boston second in offense (116.5), now seventh in defense (110.6), and second in net rating (5.9) behind the Cavaliers (6.5).

     Summary: We got to learn how to win again,” said Tatum, who netted a game-high 41 points in the loss.
I think we are playing a little timid, a little tight.”Behind a juggernaut of an offense that was operating at a historic level, the Celtics rolled through their first 26 games by winning 21 of them.
But ever since a blowout road win over the Phoenix Suns, Boston has hit a skid with their shots not falling.
It culminated with the Celtics trailing by an eye-popping 30 points in the first half to a .500 Pacers squad.
But I get a sense of everybody, we want to make every shot, myself included,” Tatum said.

It’s a credit to the Celtics that they managed to rally despite the Pacers’ 8-for-18 (44.4 percent) shooting in the second half.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Daniel Donabedian · 2 min readAfter holding the league’s best record for much of the 2022-23 season, the Boston Celtics have dropped three straight games at home and are 4-6 in their last 10 games.
While the C’s were bound to cool off after their red-hot start, they’ve suffered some rough losses as of late.
According to Celtics star Jayson Tatum, the team has to play like they’re having fun again.
“I think we’re playing a little timid, a little tight,” Tatum said, per The Athletic’s Jared Weiss.
If the Green Team can get back to playing more freely, they can perhaps snap the streak before falling too far in the standings.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Malcolm Brogdon has transitioned into an entirely different role with a new team this season and has done so effortlessly.
After being the leading scorer and a primary playmaker for Carlisle’s Indiana Pacers last season, Brogdon was traded to Boston over the summer to be the sixth man for a stacked Celtics team.
For Boston, he’s been the perfect addition, and his jack-of-all-trades skill set could be the missing piece to their championship puzzle.
He’s got a great background playing for Tony Bennett at UVA, and this is a perfect situation for the Celtics and for him.”Brogdon has let his play speak for itself.
It's been a perfect situation for the Celtics because of that production, and it's been the perfect situation for Brogdon because he now has the chance to compete for a championship contender.
