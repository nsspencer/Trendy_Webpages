     Celtics Star Jayson Tatum Opens up After Team Got Booed in Loss vs. Pacers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Celtics' recent funk continued Wednesday night.
Boston welcomed the Indiana Pacers to town looking to snap its two-game losing streak, but it instead extended to three games after losing 117-112 to Indiana at TD Garden.
The Celtics started flat -- losing the first quarter 42-22 -- and although they fought back, were never able to completely overcome the difficult loss.
After the Celtics fell to the Pacers, young star Jayson Tatum opened up about the defeat and also TD Garden reigning down boos on the squad throughout Wednesday's contest.
"There's some things we need to change, some things we need to work on, but 22-10 in 32 games.

     Slumping Celtics can’t rally past Pacers after falling behind by 30
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — Tyrese Haliburton scored 33 points and the Indiana Pacers opened a 30-point lead in the first half before holding off the slumping Boston Celtics 117-112 on Wednesday night.
Jayson Tatum led Boston with 41 points after missing a game because of personal reasons, while point guard Marcus Smart sat out with a non-COVID illness.
Atop the NBA a week ago, the Celtics have dropped three straight games and five of six.
Coming off consecutive home loss to Orlando, the Celtics fell behind by 30 points late in the second quarter before Tatum carried them back into it.
Tatum’s 3-pointer from the right wing cut Boston’s deficit to seven points midway into the final quarter.

     Amid Losing Skid Celtics Struggles Overshadow Joe Mazzulla’s Optimism
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We haven’t seen this version of the Celtics in a long time, not to this extent, probably since 2021-22.
Not even in their loss to the Chicago Bulls, who crushed Boston 120-102 back on October 24, did the Celtics look so out-worked.
Losers of five of their last six games, the Celtics are now 0-3 amid a seven-game home stand.
Since returning to TD Garden, slow starts are becoming a pattern for the Celtics, whose opponents are averaging 33.3 first-quarter points per game.
It’s up to Tatum and company to right the ship, which could teeter into a full-blown losing streak if the Celtics aren’t careful.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two weeks ago, the Celtics were 21-5 and looked like they were a tier above the rest of the NBA.
Coming off two straight losses at home to the Orlando Magic, Jayson Tatum said he thought the harsh treatment was deserved.
“We got booed, you never want to do that,” Tatum said.
Offensive woes carried over to the defensive end of the court, and that’s cause for concern according to Tatum.
Danilo Gallinari was the only other Celtics player on Friday’s injury report as he continues to recover from a torn ACL.

     Summary: At halftime, the Celtics flipped a switch.
But at least the Celtics flipped a switch.
“It would be concerning if we didn’t play a completely different style in the second half.
As Malcolm Brogdon put it after his former team manhandled the Celtics in the first half, it’s more disappointment than concern.
The breadth of the entire regular season still has Boston second in offense (116.5), now seventh in defense (110.6), and second in net rating (5.9) behind the Cavaliers (6.5).

     Summary: Celtics ‘We’ve got to learn how to win again’: Can Celtics overcome familiar problems and right the ship?
Celtics forward Jayson Tatum reacts in disbelief after his last second basket was waved off.
“Rightfully so.”In the locker room, coach Joe Mazzulla delivered a message: The Celtics need to figure out for themselves what kind of team they want to be.
In the second half, they looked a lot more like themselves — rallying back to lose by five points.
One thing is clear: The Celtics need to make 3-pointers to win games.

     Summary: We got to learn how to win again,” said Tatum, who netted a game-high 41 points in the loss.
I think we are playing a little timid, a little tight.”Behind a juggernaut of an offense that was operating at a historic level, the Celtics rolled through their first 26 games by winning 21 of them.
But ever since a blowout road win over the Phoenix Suns, Boston has hit a skid with their shots not falling.
It culminated with the Celtics trailing by an eye-popping 30 points in the first half to a .500 Pacers squad.
But I get a sense of everybody, we want to make every shot, myself included,” Tatum said.
