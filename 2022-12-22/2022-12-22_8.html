     Tom Cruise is Upping the Ante With 'The Biggest Stunt in Cinema History'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Cruise is certainly no stranger to doing his own stunts in the action movies that he's in, especially when it comes to the Mission: Impossible franchise.
After the skydiving portion of his stunt training was complete, Cruise had to become a motocross jumping professional as well, in order to properly complete the stunt jump before going into his dive.
Each jump was leading Cruise to go off of the massive stunt ramp, and preparation required Cruise to complete over 13,000 separate motocross jumps before he was ready to practice off a larger ramp.

     ‘Mission: Impossible 7’: Everything We Know About Tom Cruise’s Latest Death-Defying Installment ‘Dead Reckoning Part One’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Your mission — should you choose to accept it — is to head to theaters on July 14, 2023 for the long-awaited (and COVID-delayed) seventh installment of Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible” film franchise.
“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” marks Cruise’s latest outing as Ethan Hunt, an agent of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF), who embarks on an operation which — as the title suggests — promises to be his most dangerous yet.
Courtesy of Paramount/Everett CollectionHere’s everything you need to know about “Dead Reckoning Part One”:What does “Dead Reckoning” mean?
While the sequels (2000’s “Mission: Impossible II” and 2006’s “Mission: Impossible III”) used standard-fare Roman numerals to distinguish them, the Brad Bird-helmed fourth film, 2011’s “Ghost Protocol,” bucked that tradition.
“Dead Reckoning Part Two,” as it will presumably be called, is currently filming and is scheduled for release on June 28, 2024.
