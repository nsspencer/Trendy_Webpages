     Jets' Zach Wilson Benched vs. Jaguars, Replaced by Chris Streveler
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesIn a shocking move, the New York Jets benched quarterback Zach Wilson in the third quarter of their Thursday Night Football game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.
At the time of his exit, Wilson had completed nine of 18 passes for 92 yards and an interception.
Chris Streveler, who was elevated from the practice squad prior to Thursday's game, took over at quarterback for New York.
The Jets offense looked more efficient with White running the show, but the team suffered close losses to the Minnesota Vikings and Buffalo Bills.
White injured his ribs against Buffalo, forcing the Jets to turn back to Wilson.

     Thursday Night Football: Chris Streveler replaces Zach Wilson at quarterback in third quarter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Jets have benched Wilson in the third quarter in favor of Streveler, who was elevated for Thursday’s game from the practice squad.
New York had only three first downs with Wilson in, as the quarterback was 9-of-18 for 92 yards with an interception.
Streveler provided an immediate spark, as the Jets netted four first downs on a 16-play drive.
But on the next fourth-and-2, Streveler’s pass was incomplete and the Jets didn’t come away with points.
It’s hard to imagine the Jets will go back to Wilson in this game.

(Photo by Dustin Satloff/Getty Images)It wasn’t a high-scoring affair but the Jacksonville Jaguars took care of business in Week 16, beating the New York Jets 19-3 on Thursday Night Football.
So how did Zach Wilson, who filled in for Mike White, fare against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday Night Football?
Although Streveler gave the Jets’ offense a spark when he took over at quarterback, it wasn’t nearly enough to get over the top.
The former Clemson Tiger went 20-of-31 for 229 yards with no passing touchdowns, one rushing touchdown, and one interception.

     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Jets will have quarterback Chris Streveler available for Thursday night’s game against the Jaguars.
Streveler was elevated from the practice squad to the active roster for the matchup.
Streveler was elevated in Week Eight as well, but did not play in that game.
It is supposed to be wet and windy at MetLife Stadium on Thursday night and Streveler could factor into the game plan as a runner.
The Jets also elevated safety Will Parks, who was released from the active roster last week and signed to the practice squad this week.

     Summary: Is the Jets’ summer hero set to contribute to a Christmas miracle?
The New York Jets have announced the activation of quarterback Chris Streveler and safety Will Parks for Thursday night’s crucial contest against the Jacksonville Jaguars (8:15 p.m.
Parks, of course, is no stranger to the Jets’ defense, having appeared in 15 games over the last two seasons.
Jets fans are no doubt intrigued by the return of Streveler, who became a metropolitan gridiron folk hero of sorts for his stellar preseason play over the summer.
Streveler has seven games of NFL experience under his belt, all coming with the Arizona Cardinals over the prior two seasons.
