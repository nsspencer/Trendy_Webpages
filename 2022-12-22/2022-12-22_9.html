     Summary: The first face card to pose an issue to players is the King of Spades.
Right from the beginning of the show, he spawns as a mercenary who will stop at nothing to attempt to kill all the players.
He is a constant throughout all of Season 2 and the game will not end until players manage to kill him.
They're also able to track him across the city and take solace in the fact that he cannot interrupt any other games going on.

If you were hoping for a happy ending in the Jack of Hearts game, you should know there is no such thing in Borderland.
Yaba and Banda may be like Arisu because they are intent on learning more about the rules in Borderland.
Following the deaths of Tatta and Kyuma, both of which he feels somewhat responsible for, Arisu isn’t as motivated to continue looking for answers.
• I was low-key rooting for Kotoko to win the Jack of Hearts game.
