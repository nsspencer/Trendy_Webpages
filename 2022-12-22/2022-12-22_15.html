     Zelenskyy: Trip to US Delivered ‘Good Results’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A brief wartime trip to the United States delivered “good results,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told his nation in a nightly video address on Thursday.
"We are returning from Washington with good results, with things that will really help," Zelenskyy said on a video posted to his Telegram account and linked to YouTube.
Zelenskyy visited the United States on Wednesday, meeting privately with Biden and later addressing a joint meeting of Congress.
However, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Zelenskyy's trip only fueled the conflict.
"They say they may send Patriot there, fine, we will crack the Patriot, too," Putin told reporters.

     Summary: M-TAC launched in 2005 selling airsoft guns and accessories and started a clothing brand in 2014.
An M-TAC manager previously told Insider that Zelenskyy's olive green fleece was out of stock.
Per the company's website, M-TAC has more than 50 suppliers in 15 countries of the world.
Since Russia first invaded Ukraine, M-TAC has seen demand soar for Zelenskyy's fleece jacket, Taras Rudnytskyi, the Ukrainian manager of US operations for the company, previously told Insider.
"We hope to restock it someday, maybe after our victory," Rudnytskyi told Insider in May, adding that hostilities have made it difficult to continue any type of production.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zelenskyy was at the top of the news Wednesday with a hastily announced visit to the White House and Congress.
All of this played out before Zelenskyy traveled to a joint session of Congress where he again pleaded his case.
Still, none of this seemed to fully explain why Zelenskyy chose Wednesday as a day to visit.
At the end of the day Zelenskyy, still dressed in his war uniform, as he had been all day, heard bipartisan cheers as he spoke to Congress.
As it turns out, the reason for Zelenskyy's visit was as deep as this: The medium is the message.

     Why Zelenskyy’s D.C. visit took months to coordinate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the two presidents discussed the trip on Dec. 11, the White House extended a formal invite on Dec. 14, according to the senior administration official.
Zelenskyy accepted the invitation on Friday, and the visit was confirmed two days later, at which point White House officials notified Pelosi’s office of the Ukrainian leader’s travel plans.
The White House didn’t publicly announce the impending Zelenskyy visit until 1 a.m. Wednesday — waiting until they felt Zelenskyy was safely out of Ukraine.
“Your visit comes as the Congress prepares to again pass another consequential round of security, economic and humanitarian assistance,” Pelosi told Zelenskyy.
In a visit Tuesday to Bakhmut, located in Ukraine’s contested Donetsk province, Zelenskyy was handed a Ukrainian flag.
