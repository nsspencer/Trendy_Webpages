    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The bond market had trouble making up its mind following the latest consumer price index report, which revealed inflation continues to moderate, though not across the board.
“Bottom line, the continued drop in goods prices is offsetting continued acceleration in service prices,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, wrote in an email.

     Treasury yields fall as CPI posts a slight decline as expected
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The yield on the benchmark 10-year was down by about 13 basis points at 3.427%.
The 2-year Treasury yield was trading nearly 10 basis points lower at around 4.13%.
That's the last CPI reading before the Fed's next meeting on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, which will conclude with the central bank's latest interest rate decision.
With persisting uncertainty about whether the Fed will hike rates by 25 or 50 basis points next, investors are hoping to gain new clues from Thursday's CPI data.
After implementing four consecutive 75 basis point rate increases, the central bank slightly slowed the pace of rate hikes to 50 basis points at its last meeting.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI rose 0.3%, also meeting expectations.
Even with the decline, headline CPI rose 6.5% from a year ago, highlighting the persistent burden that the rising cost of living has placed on U.S. households.
The consumer price index , which measures the cost of a broad basket of goods and services, fell 0.1% for the month, in line with the Dow Jones estimate.
Inflation closed out 2022 in a modest retreat, with consumer prices in December posting their biggest monthly decline since early in the pandemic, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
Medical care services increased 0.1% after dropping for two straight months, while apparel prices rose 0.5% and transportation services were up 0.2% and are still 14.6% higher from a year ago.

     Summary: Consumer prices slowed further in December, boosting hopes that the worst of red-hot inflation is behind the U.S.
The annual inflation rate fell from 7.1 percent in November to 6.5 percent in December, according to the consumer price index, released Thursday morning.
Prices fell 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent in November.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, inflation rose 5.7 percent over the last 12 months ending in December and 0.3 percent on a month-to-month basis.
Consumer price inflation for December couldn’t have been much better,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi tweeted.

Wolfers noted that with core inflation around 3%, many Americans will feel that the crisis has abated in the coming months.

     Inflation slowed further in December for the sixth month in a row
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The annual rate of price increases was the slowest since October 2021.
Inflation is still well above normal levels, and the economy remains vulnerable to shocks that could send prices back up.
“And so far, it hasn’t slowed the economy so much that we’ve seen net losses in jobs.”AdvertisementStocks closed up slightly on the news.
Economists have many ways to look under the hood of the inflation report to tease out whether supply chains are improving or worker shortages are putting pressure on prices.
“And indeed, three months of outright declines — that is spectacular news.”If a trend toward lower price increases is in the making, there’s a long way to go.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cooling inflation could allow the Federal Reserve to further scale back the pace of its interest rate increases next month.
"To be sure, the efforts by the Fed have begun to bear fruit, even though it will be a while before the promised land of a 2% inflation rate is here."
The CPI rose 0.1% in November.
Apparel prices rose despite retailers offering discounts to clear excess inventory.
With labor costs accounting for about two-thirds of the CPI, Fed officials will want to see more compelling evidence of abating prices pressures before pausing rate hikes.

     Summary: The closely watched inflation gauge also showed that year-over-year prices continued to cool last month, slowing to 6.5%, from 7.1% in November.
Thursday’s CPI report showed just that … and then some.
Most notably, food prices grew at the smallest monthly rate since March of 2021, BLS data shows.
But that’s still higher than overall inflation, with prices up 11.8% annually in December and certain products considerably higher.
In addition to food prices still being on the rise, core inflation picked up 0.3% in December from November.
