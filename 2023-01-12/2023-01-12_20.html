     Pepsi discontinues Sierra Mist, unveils new soda Starry to compete with Sprite
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pepsi launched a new lemon-lime soda called Starry on Wednesday to replace its Sierra Mist beverage and compete against Coca-Cola's Sprite.
Some have already hit store shelves as the soda made its social media debut on Wednesday.
A PepsiCo representative described the soda, claiming it has "higher citrus flavors that are true to fruit and more aromatic which delivers a more balanced, cleaner, crisp finish than Sierra Mist."
This comes after the Federal Trade Commission launched a preliminary investigation into whether PepsiCo violated a law regulating pricing strategies.
As of December 2021, the company employed 309,000 people globally and roughly 129,000 in the United States.

     Pepsi lemon-lime soda Sierra Mist discontinued, replaced with citrus-flavored Starry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pepsi has discontinued its lemon-lime soda Sierra Mist, and is rolling out a new citrus-flavored competitor to Coca-Cola brand Sprite called Starry, the company has announced.
Sierra Mist failed to keep up with Sprite in the $82 billion soda market.
Whereas Sprite controls around 7% of market share according to Bloomberg, Sierra Mist sales were a mere 0.1% of that market in 2022.
Sierra Mist, launched in 1999, was not able to break through.
To break the new brand into the beverage market, Pepsi offered their partners a guide on the soda’s appeal to consumers.
