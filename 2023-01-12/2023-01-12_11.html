     Kamala Harris Pops By Office To Print Out Concert Tickets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON—Peeking around corners and ducking past doorways in an effort to get in and out of her workplace unseen, Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly popped by the Eisenhower Executive Office Building late Wednesday to print out concert tickets.
Upon confirming all members of her staff, who she had allegedly not seen in months, had left work for the day, Harris is said to have entered her office for the sole purpose of using a printer to access a pair of passes to that night’s Goo Goo Dolls show at the Merriweather Post pavilion in Columbia, MD.
As a precaution in case she encountered her chief of staff or one of her aides, sources confirmed the vice president walked into the facility with her phone up to her ear, ready to engage in a phony conversation about how climate change was a “really tough issue” and to sigh loudly in order to sound very busy.
According to reports, Harris then logged into Ticketmaster from her office computer, downloaded a file she renamed “border_security_ideas.pdf,” and printed the document with a nearby Epson EcoTank Pro ET-5850.
After the vice president grabbed a granola bar from the kitchen and slipped out of the office mostly undetected, the Eisenhower building’s IT administrator was overheard giving Harris a hard time for using up all of the printer’s ink on her full-color personal holiday cards.

     Vice President Kamala Harris visits Ann Arbor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vice President Kamala Harris is visiting Ann Arbor on Thursday.
During her visit, the VP plans to discuss the actions President Joe Biden's administration is taking to combat climate change.
That included the largest-ever federal effort on climate change — close to $400 billion.
Clean energy would be fostered with tax credits for buying electric vehicles and manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines.
There would be home energy rebates, funds for constructing factories building clean energy technology and money to promote climate-friendly farm practices and reduce pollution in minority communities.

We need Congress to act.
Harris also said Congress was playing political games.
"I wish the United States Congress would stop playing political games with this, and that so-called leaders would stop playing political games with this, and using it as a point of division instead of actually working on the solutions.

     Kamala Harris in Ann Arbor: Young activists must lead charge against climate change
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ANN ARBOR − Truly eradicating the detrimental impacts of climate change requires activism, investment and an understanding of how pervasive these problems are through society, Vice President Kamala Harris argued during an event Thursday afternoon at the University of Michigan.
In the past, when President Joe Biden visited Michigan to tout the bill, he has pointed to how it helped the electric vehicle economy.
In Michigan, climate change and the affiliated political or policy battles are intertwined irrevocably with the Great Lakes, the automotive industry and a contentious fight over a pipeline.
At the same time, much of the innovation and focus in the industry revolves around electric vehicle expansion.
An electric vehicle — not a hybrid, but one that relies solely on electricity to operate — doesn't have any emissions, although the EPA notes producing and shipping these vehicles frequently results in emissions.
