     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Robbie Bachman, the drummer for the Canadian hard rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive that was known for such 1970s hits as “Takin’ Care of Business” and “You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yet,” has died at age 69.
As BTO, Robbie Bachman and the others continued to tour and record, but their popularity faded and they broke up in 1980.
