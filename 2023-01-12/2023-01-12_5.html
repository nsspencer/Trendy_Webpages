     Summary: Consumer prices slowed further in December, boosting hopes that the worst of red-hot inflation is behind the U.S.
The annual inflation rate fell from 7.1 percent in November to 6.5 percent in December, according to the consumer price index, released Thursday morning.
Prices fell 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent in November.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, inflation rose 5.7 percent over the last 12 months ending in December and 0.3 percent on a month-to-month basis.
Consumer price inflation for December couldn’t have been much better,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi tweeted.

     Stocks close higher, Nasdaq clinches fifth day of gains after CPI report shows cooling inflation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stocks closed higher Thursday after December's consumer price report showed inflation cooled for the month, raising hopes the Federal Reserve can once again slow interest rate hikes.
December's CPI report showed a 0.1% dip in prices from November, but prices were still 6.5% higher than the prior year.
In November, the report showed a 0.1% monthly gain and an annual pace of 7.1%.
"I think the markets are pleased, but they don't seem to be overly excited," said Sandi Bragar, chief client officer at Aspiriant, of the reaction to the CPI report.
Stocks have rallied in recent sessions as investors bet the CPI report would confirm a weakening inflation trend.

     Inflation slowed further in December for the sixth month in a row
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The annual rate of price increases was the slowest since October 2021.
Inflation is still well above normal levels, and the economy remains vulnerable to shocks that could send prices back up.
“And so far, it hasn’t slowed the economy so much that we’ve seen net losses in jobs.”AdvertisementStocks closed up slightly on the news.
Economists have many ways to look under the hood of the inflation report to tease out whether supply chains are improving or worker shortages are putting pressure on prices.
“And indeed, three months of outright declines — that is spectacular news.”If a trend toward lower price increases is in the making, there’s a long way to go.

     U.S. inflation retreating as consumer prices fall; labor market still tight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cooling inflation could allow the Federal Reserve to further scale back the pace of its interest rate increases next month.
"To be sure, the efforts by the Fed have begun to bear fruit, even though it will be a while before the promised land of a 2% inflation rate is here."
The CPI rose 0.1% in November.
Apparel prices rose despite retailers offering discounts to clear excess inventory.
With labor costs accounting for about two-thirds of the CPI, Fed officials will want to see more compelling evidence of abating prices pressures before pausing rate hikes.

     Summary: The closely watched inflation gauge also showed that year-over-year prices continued to cool last month, slowing to 6.5%, from 7.1% in November.
Thursday’s CPI report showed just that … and then some.
Most notably, food prices grew at the smallest monthly rate since March of 2021, BLS data shows.
But that’s still higher than overall inflation, with prices up 11.8% annually in December and certain products considerably higher.
In addition to food prices still being on the rise, core inflation picked up 0.3% in December from November.
