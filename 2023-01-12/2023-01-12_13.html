     Smith, Key GOP Leaders Introduce REIN IN Inflation Act to Fight Biden Policies Fueling Inflation Fire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This bill would require the administration to publish the inflationary impact of executive actions before enacting them.
“President Biden’s inflationary executive actions have fueled the economic pain facing all Americans.
The White House would then have to report these findings to Congress each year to increase transparency and accountability over executive actions.
President Biden’s executive actions have exacerbated inflation by spending more than $1 trillion since he took office.
As the Biden Administration continues to push harmful economic policies, this legislation would require them to consider and report the financial impact their actions have on hardworking Americans.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Used cars and airline fares also fell in price, while gains in food prices slowed.
Here are three charts that help explain where inflation stands right now.
In December, food prices rose 0.3 percent from the month before, down from 0.5 percent in November.
A large component of core inflation is shelter prices, which rose 0.8 percent in December, up from 0.6 percent the month before.
“So, once we work our way through that backlog, that inflation will come down sometime next year.”Fed officials also pay attention to other categories within core inflation.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The annual rate of price increases was the slowest since October 2021.
Inflation is still well above normal levels, and the economy remains vulnerable to shocks that could send prices back up.
“And so far, it hasn’t slowed the economy so much that we’ve seen net losses in jobs.”AdvertisementStocks closed up slightly on the news.
Economists have many ways to look under the hood of the inflation report to tease out whether supply chains are improving or worker shortages are putting pressure on prices.
“And indeed, three months of outright declines — that is spectacular news.”If a trend toward lower price increases is in the making, there’s a long way to go.

     Summary: Cooling inflation could allow the Federal Reserve to further scale back the pace of its interest rate increases next month.
"To be sure, the efforts by the Fed have begun to bear fruit, even though it will be a while before the promised land of a 2% inflation rate is here."
The CPI rose 0.1% in November.
Apparel prices rose despite retailers offering discounts to clear excess inventory.
With labor costs accounting for about two-thirds of the CPI, Fed officials will want to see more compelling evidence of abating prices pressures before pausing rate hikes.

     Summary: A decline in the annual inflation rate doesn't mean consumers saw deflation, which is when overall prices decrease.
The decline in the annual inflation rate means that prices rose at a slower pace than earlier in the year.

Car and truck rental prices fell by 4.9%, while beef and veal prices fell by 3.1%, women's dresses by 2.3% and admission to sporting events by 1.5%.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “This is the starting point for much better inflation rates, which should bolster consumer and business confidence,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at tax consultants RSM.
December’s lower inflation reading makes it likelier that the Fed will slow its interest rate hikes in the coming months.
The Fed’s higher rates are intended to slow spending, cool the economy and curb inflation.
But if inflation continues to ease, the Fed could suspend its rate hikes after that, some economists say, or implement just one additional hike in March and then pause.
Fed officials may choose to keep their key rate above 5 percent until inflation gets closer to its 2 percent target.

     Summary: "The raise in pay was just in time for inflation," Simpson says.
The annual inflation rate declined from 7.1% in November and a four-decade high of 9.1% in June.
But the Federal Reserve still has a long way to go as it tries to restore price stability.
Inflation still stings in the supermarket aislePutting food on the table is increasingly costly, with grocery prices up 11.8% in the last year.
The central bank is expected to raise interest rates again in early February, and keep rates elevated until it's clear that inflation is under control.

     Summary: The closely watched inflation gauge also showed that year-over-year prices continued to cool last month, slowing to 6.5%, from 7.1% in November.
Thursday’s CPI report showed just that … and then some.
Most notably, food prices grew at the smallest monthly rate since March of 2021, BLS data shows.
But that’s still higher than overall inflation, with prices up 11.8% annually in December and certain products considerably higher.
In addition to food prices still being on the rise, core inflation picked up 0.3% in December from November.
