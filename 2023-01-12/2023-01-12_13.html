     Chicago Bears Hiring Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren as President, CEO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to ESPN.com, the Chicago Bears are set to hire Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren as their next President and CEO.
Warren replaces Ted Phillips, who announced his retirement following a 40-year run with the historic franchise.
The 59-year-old was hired by the Big Ten in 2020, becoming the first-ever Black commissioner of a Power Five conference.
Before he arrived in the Big Ten, Warren spent 22 years in NFL front offices, most recently serving as the chief operating officer for the Minnesota Vikings from 2015-2019.
In Chicago, Warren takes over a Bears team amid a rebuild and holds the first overall selection in the 2023 NFL Draft.

     The defining piece of Kevin Warren's legacy as Big Ten commissioner hasn't played out yet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warren was the next commissioner hired after the SEC elevated Greg Sankey, Mike Slive’s deputy, four years prior.
“Commissioner Warren was pivotal in the expansion from 14 to 16 academic and athletic member institutions and leading the media rights negotiations for the conference.
Related:Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren named Chicago Bears president and CEOHe delivered the billion-dollar media rights deal everyone expected to shift the paradigm for television revenues in college sports.
What if revenue sharing, the next logical step in athlete compensation, wipes out a big chunk of that media rights deal?
The most important chapter of Kevin Warren’s legacy will be written after he’s left the office to the next Big Ten commissioner, for better or worse.
