     Ben Simmons Mocked by Twitter for Not Scoring as Nets Lose to Jayson Tatum, Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AP Photo/Wilfredo LeeThe Brooklyn Nets are going to need Kevin Durant to compete with the Boston Celtics come playoff time.
While the Nets didn't have Durant because of a knee injury, Jaylen Brown was sidelined on the other side with an adductor strain.
However, none of that scoring came from Ben Simmons, who failed to notch a single point while going 0-of-3 from the field.
However, it became more difficult to compete as the game progressed with the Celtics not having to worry about Simmons as a scorer.
He will get another chance to do just that Sunday when the Nets host the Oklahoma City Thunder.

     Ben Simmons takes a bagel vs. Celtics, joins his own coach in dubious statistical club
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the Brooklyn Nets, no one player can replace the production of Kevin Durant, who is reportedly out for the next month, maybe more, with a sprained MCL.
From a scoring standpoint, things didn't go so well for Simmons in Brooklyn's first game since KD's injury.
He was the only Brooklyn player to post a positive point differential: plus-10 in 26 minutes.
Throw in Simmons' nine rebounds along with 13 assists and zero points, and the club shrinks to just three: Norm Van Lier in 1971, Tomas Satoransky and now Simmons.
A lot of guys put up 13 assists and nine boards in a game.

     Ben Simmons: 'I Need to Get Buckets' with Kevin Durant Out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a crucial quarter where Brooklyn only tallied 16 points and have Boston steal the contest, it was also the first example of why Ben Simmons needs to look to score with Kevin Durant sidelined.
I think I was giving the ball a few too many times," Simmons said postgame.
I think it’s something I need to do to help the team," said Simmons on looking to score.
"We’re not gonna let this one particular game or any other games where he scored eight points, four points, it doesn’t matter.
The Nets' head coach Jacque Vaughn echoed a similar statement, shooting down the heavy need for Simmons to score.

     Summary: Before Thursday’s game, coach Jacque Vaughn said he was not going to ask Ben Simmons to score any more with Kevin Durant sidelined.
Simmons then did just about everything except score in the Nets’ 109-98 loss to the Celtics at Barclays Center.
On Thursday, Simmons admitted he needed to be more aggressive as the Nets played their first game without Durant (MCL sprain), who is averaging 29.7 points per game.
Ben Simmons, who had 13 assists, makes a pass during the Nets’ 109-98 loss to the Celtics.
Vaughn indicated Harris was the choice to join the starting lineup because the Nets want to shoot more 3-pointers in Durant’s absence.

     Summary: The Boston Celtics continued to roll Thursday night, adding to their NBA-best record of 31-12.
Their victory, a 109-98 defeat of the Brooklyn Nets, was a complete team effort on both ends of the floor.
Postgame, Nets forward Ben Simmons spoke about what Boston does so well.
“Coming in here and playing a team like that — that’s fun,” Simmons said postgame, per Celtics’ Taylor Snow.
“They have some great individuals, but when you put it together, they play team basketball.

     Summary: Seth Curry scored 11 points, and Ben Simmons went scoreless but dished out 13 assists, a season high, and had nine rebounds.
(Mary Altaffer / Associated Press)Before Durant went down, Vaughn said he wanted Simmons to play with force on every possession.
Asked afterward about his play, Simmons said Durant’s absence wasn’t necessarily a reason to be more aggressive.
Against the Celtics, Vaughn said that was lacking at times, too.
Got to accept that.”(Top photo of Kyrie Irving reacting after committing a foul against the Celtics: Wendell Cruz / USA Today)
