     NBA All-Star Game 2023: LeBron James, Kevin Durant Lead 2nd Voting Results
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lachlan Cunningham/Getty ImagesLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (West) and Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant (East) continue to lead their respective conferences in the second round of NBA All-Star voting.
The NBA released its latest results Thursday, with James looking like an overwhelming favorite to captain the West, while Durant battles in a neck-and-neck race with Giannis Antetokounmpo.
James has been a captain in every All-Star Game since the league instituted its fantasy draft format in 2018.
It's expected he will miss around a month of action, so he's no guarantee to even suit up for the All-Star Game.
Despite being captain the past two years, Durant has been unable to participate in the game because of injury.

     Latest NBA All-Star Voting Results Have LeBron James, Kevin Durant Leading The Way
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Thursday, the NBA released the numbers for the second wave of fan voting for the 2023 NBA All-Star Game with Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James and Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant leading the Western Conference and Eastern Conference, respectively, in voting.
The 2023 NBA All-Star Game is scheduled to take place on Sunday, February 19 in Salt Lake City and on Thursday, the NBA released the results in the second fan returns of All-Star voting.
As laid out, 50 percent of the fan vote will decide the 2023 NBA All-Star Game starters, as NBA players and a select media panel will account for 25 percent of the vote each.
In the Eastern Conference, Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant is the leading vote-getter with 4,509,238 total votes and he ranks second behind James in total votes league-wide.
However, it is highly unlikely that either player makes the All-Star Game due to the players and media voting.

     Lakers Vs. Mavericks Preview: LeBron James &amp; Luka Doncic Square Off In L.A.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers saw their five-game win streak snapped on Monday against the Denver Nuggets.
Now back home, they look to start up another streak and get some revenge for what happened on Christmas Day against the Dallas Mavericks.
Dallas outscored the Lakers 51-to-21 in the third quarter, completely flipping the contest and leading to an easy win for the Mavericks.
The Lakers have won 6-of-8 games since that night, however, while the Mavericks have lost three of their last four since their seven-game win streak was snapped.
Containing Luka Doncic is basically impossible, but the Lakers can not allow both Tim Hardaway Jr. and Christian Wood to go off once again.
