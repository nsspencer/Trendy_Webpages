     Raiders Evaluating Trade Market for QB Derek Carr
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr has likely played his final snap in Silver and Black.
According to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, the Raiders “will begin the process of evaluating the trade market” for the veteran quarterback.
Sources: The #Raiders will begin the process of evaluating the trade market for QB Derek Carr, as they prepare for a decision on their QB for the future.
Carr particularly struggled down the stretch, tossing nine interceptions over his final five games as Las Vegas failed to qualify for the postseason.
Selected 36th overall in the 2014 draft, Carr has spent his entire nine-year NFL career with the Raiders.

     Derek Carr Posts Goodbye Message to Raider Nation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Derek Carr posted a goodbye message to Raider Nation on Wednesday, seemingly confirming that Las Vegas has seen the last of the quarterback.
“Raider Nation, it breaks my heart I didn’t get an opportunity to say goodbye in person,” he wrote.
… It’s especially hard to say goodbye because I can honestly say that I gave you everything I had, every single day, in season, and in the off season.
Carr and the team reportedly mutually agreed that the 31-year-old would step away for the final two games of the season to not be a distraction.
On New Year’s Day, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported Las Vegas will begin exploring possible trade destinations for Carr in the offseason.

     QB Derek Carr says goodbye to Raider Nation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Quarterback Derek Carr said farewell to the Las Vegas Raiders over social media on Thursday.
"Raider Nation it breaks my heart I didn't get an opportunity to say goodbye in person," Carr wrote on Twitter.
"I once said that if I'm not a Raider I would rather be at home and I meant that, but I never envisioned it ending this way," Carr wrote.
The Raiders are expected to attempt to trade Carr, who has a no-trade clause in the three-year, $121.5 million extension he signed in April.
Carr was benched for the final two games of the season and stepped away from the team during that time.

     Derek Carr writes Raiders goodbye, says title fire 'still rages'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HENDERSON, Nev. -- Two weeks and a day after being benched by the Las Vegas Raiders, quarterback Derek Carr broke his silence and bade farewell to the team's fans in a statement on social media Thursday.
Carr had been the Raiders' starting quarterback since being selected in the second round of the 2014 NFL draft.
In his latest statement, Carr acknowledged those feelings but said he looked forward to playing for another NFL team.
So while Carr might find a robust market for his services, his trade value to the Raiders might not be as high as it once was.
The Raiders finished 6-11, and Carr finished with 3,522 passing yards, 24 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 15 games.

     Raiders evaluating trade market for Derek Carr; QB says goodbye, looks forward to 'new team'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With only a slim chance of reaching the postseason, first-year coach Josh McDaniels decided to rip off the bandage, benching Carr in favor of Jarrett Stidham for the final two weeks.
Stidham was surprisingly effective, but the results -- two losses to end the season -- were far too familiar.
Carr signed an extension with the Raiders in early 2022, seemingly pairing him with McDaniels for the foreseeable future.
With little cap penalty to consider, the Raiders are doing just that.
Carr will be a hot commodity in the offseason for teams seeking answers at quarterback, but questions linger regarding his viability as a starter.
