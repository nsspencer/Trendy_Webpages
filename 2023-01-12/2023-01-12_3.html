     Inflation slowed to 6.5 percent in December: CPI
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Consumer prices slowed further in December, boosting hopes that the worst of red-hot inflation is behind the U.S.
The annual inflation rate fell from 7.1 percent in November to 6.5 percent in December, according to the consumer price index, released Thursday morning.
Prices fell 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent in November.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, inflation rose 5.7 percent over the last 12 months ending in December and 0.3 percent on a month-to-month basis.
Consumer price inflation for December couldn’t have been much better,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi tweeted.

     Dow climbs more than 200 points after December CPI report shows cooling inflation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stocks advanced Thursday after December's consumer price report came in line with economist expectations and showed signs of cooling inflation.
The December report showed a 0.1% dip in prices from November but was still 6.5% higher than the prior year.
In November, the report showed a 0.1% monthly gain and an annual pace of 7.1%.
"I think the markets are pleased, but they don't seem to be overly excited," said Sandi Bragar, chief client officer at Aspiriant, of the reaction to the CPI report.
Stocks rallied in recent sessions as investors bet the CPI report would confirm a weakening inflation trend.

     Fragile Megacap Tech Stocks Face CPI Test After New Year Rally
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a grueling year for technology stocks, investors have turned optimistic at the start of 2023, taking the view that the Federal Reserve may slow the pace of interest rate hikes.
The first inflation reading of the year is about to put that sentiment to the test.
Tech behemoths including Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have rallied for four consecutive sessions as traders bet that the consumer price index for December will show further cooling.
Amazon is leading the pack, having gained 13% this year.

     Inflation slowed further in December for the sixth month in a row
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The annual rate of price increases was the slowest since October 2021.
Inflation is still well above normal levels, and the economy remains vulnerable to shocks that could send prices back up.
Prices for used cars and trucks fell 2.5 percent in December, the sixth consecutive month of declines.
Economists have many ways to look under the hood of the inflation report to tease out whether supply chains are improving or if worker shortages are putting pressure on prices.
“And indeed, three months of outright declines — that is spectacular news.”If a trend toward lower price increases is in the making, there’s a long way to go.

     Summary: The closely watched inflation gauge also showed that year-over-year prices continued to cool last month, slowing to 6.5%, from 7.1% in November.
Thursday’s CPI report showed just that … and then some.
Most notably, food prices grew at the smallest monthly rate since March of 2021, BLS data shows.
But that’s still higher than overall inflation, with prices up 11.8% annually in December and certain products considerably higher.
In addition to food prices still being on the rise, core inflation picked up 0.3% in December from November.
