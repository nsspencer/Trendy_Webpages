     Meyers Leonard to work out with Los Angeles Lakers on Friday: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Free-agent center Meyers Leonard will work out for the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday, league sources told The Athletic on Thursday.
The Lakers have searched for potential shooting and size, with Leonard and DeMarcus Cousins set for free-agent workouts Friday.
Leonard and Cousins, both of whom Los Angeles will work out on Friday, address needs as stretch-5s that can soak up minutes in the paint.
Leonard (39.0 percent career 3-point shooter) can both pick-and-pop and spot up beyond the arc.
Sterling Brown is currently on a 10-day contract with Los Angeles.

     Lakers rip no-call at end of regulation, say foul 'clear as day'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Luka Doncic posts 35 points, 14 rebounds and 13 assists to lead the Mavericks past the Lakers in double overtime.
James and Brown immediately expressed their frustration with the outcome of the play to referee Suyah Mehta, who was the closest official to the action.
Brown was asked about the no-call in the postgame locker room and offered a diplomatic response.
"No, it's a f---ing foul," James said strongly for everyone in the room to hear.
But it just looked clear as day like it was a foul," Ham said.

     Summary: How was he going to instruct his team to defend Luka Doncic?
Schroder had plenty of time to foul Doncic before he was in position to go into the shooting motion.
"We weren't looking to foul," Ham said.
Let's say the Lakers foul at eight or nine seconds.
Especially when Luka Doncic is on the other team.

     Lakers News: Controversial Veteran Big Man To Work Out For LA This Week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sources inform Shams Charania of The Athletic that nine-year veteran center Meyers Leonard is going to audition for LA this Friday.
Leonard will be the second confirmed center that the Lakers are set to work out tomorrow, as it was also announced earlier today that LA is also taking a look at former four-time All-Star five DeMarcus Cousins.
The former All-Defensive Team honoree actually signed with LA in 2019 but never played a second for the team due to a preseason ACL tear.
Leonard quickly apologized for the incident (unlike some other hypothetical future Lakers), and was enrolled in a cultural diversity program by the NBA.
Leonard boasts a sparkling 39% three-pointer conversion rate on 1.9 tries a night over the duration of his career.

     Lakers will work out DeMarcus Cousins, Meyers Leonard on Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: National Basketball Association Lakers will work out DeMarcus Cousins, Meyers Leonard on Friday 10 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit linkThe Los Angeles Lakers will hold free-agent workouts for four-time NBA All-Star DeMarcus Cousins and veteran center Meyers Leonard on Friday, according to reports.
Sterling Brown, who played for the Dallas Mavericks during the 2021-22 season, signed a 10-day contract with the Lakers on Jan. 6.
On paper, it doesn't make much sense for the Lakers to sign another center, as they currently employ three in Anthony Davis, Thomas Bryant and Damian Jones.
That opens the door for Cousins or Leonard to be the Lakers' true backup center.
Neither Cousins nor Leonard have played in the NBA this season.

DeMarcus Cousins, 32, and Meyers Leonard, 30, are expected to work out for the team on Friday, according to Bleacher Report and The Athletic respectively.
Cousins was a Laker before, getting injured prior to the 2019-20 season during a summer workout.
In Leonard‚Äôs last full NBA season, he averaged 6.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game while shooting 41.4% from 3-point range.
Leonard faced the Lakers in the NBA Finals with the Heat, but only played in two of the six games.
