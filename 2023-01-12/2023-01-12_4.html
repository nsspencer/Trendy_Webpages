     Celtics' Jaylen Brown could miss 'a week or so' with injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Celtics will be without Jaylen Brown for Thursday's game vs. the Brooklyn Nets and potentially longer.
Brown was ruled out for Thursday night due to right adductor tightness, which bothered him at the end of Wednesday's win over the New Orleans Pelicans.
After his 41-point performance, Brown revealed the injury to NBC Sports Boston's Abby Chin and said he would get it looked at.
C's interim head coach Joe Mazzulla provided an update on Brown shortly after the team ruled him out against Brooklyn.
Mazzulla added that he expects a short recovery timeline for Brown, who's likely to miss at least a couple of games.

     Boston Celtics' Jaylen Brown sidelined with adductor strain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum put on a show in the Celtics' definitive win over the Pelicans Wednesday night.
(2:08)NEW YORK -- Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown will miss Thursday night's game at Barclays Center in Brooklyn against the Nets with a right adductor strain, and he could miss "a week or two," per Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla.
"I anticipate it being pretty short," Mazzulla said before Thursday night's game, when asked how long Brown -- who was ruled out a little over 90 minutes before tip -- would be sidelined.
Mazzulla said Brown tried to warm up to play Thursday but was deemed unable to go.
Brown, 26, is averaging career highs in both points (27.2 per game) and field goal percentage (49.8%) this season for Boston, which entered Thursday's game against Brooklyn with the NBA's best record.

     Jaylen Brown's Final Injury Status for Celtics vs Nets Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It seems like the big matchup between the Brooklyn Nets and Boston Celtics may be a little bit more even-sided.
It's been revealed that Jaylen Brown has now been downgraded to out with an adductor strain against the Brooklyn Nets.
Both teams will now be missing a big gun, as the Celtics will be missing Jaylen Brown and the Nets will be missing Kevin Durant.
The last time the Brooklyn Nets and Boston Celtics faced off was a great measuring stick for the Nets, where they realized they still weren't quite a great team yet.
That game was on December 4, and since that moment, the Brooklyn Nets have improved to become a great team.

     Summary: Celtics guard Jaylen Brown did not play in Boston’s 109-98 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday due to right adductor tightness.
He may not return to the court for another “week or two,” per Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla.
Halfway through the NBA season, Brown is averaging a career-high 27.2 points and making nearly half (49.8%) of his shots from the field.
The Celtics play eight games over the next two weeks, six of which are on the road.
Boston (31-12) has a 3-game lead for first place after winning five straight games, including Thursday’s win over second-plae Brooklyn (27-14).

Brown also had 12 rebounds on the night, which put him in a rather exclusive group of Celtics.
As noted by ESPN Stats &amp; Info, Brown became just the sixth Celtics player to have multiple 40-point, 10-rebounds games.

     Summary: NEW YORK — The Celtics were shorthanded Thursday night against the Nets, as Jaylen Brown was downgraded to out because of adductor tightness.
With Brown out, expect the Celtics to spread out his minutes to Malcolm Brogdon, Derrick White and perhaps Payton Pritchard.
Robert Williams III (left knee injury rehabilitation) was back in the lineup after sitting out Wednesday’s game for precautionary reasons.
The next fan voting update is on Jan. 19 and voting will conclude on Jan. 21.
Brown also trails Brooklyn’s Kyrie Irving and Cleveland’s Donovan Mitchell in fan voting.

     Summary: Celtics ‘Comfort will kill you’: The Celtics are showing they’re hungry for more than the NBA’s best record Halfway through the season, Boston's record is the NBA's best.
But, this year’s Celtics team isn’t like most.
They’re uncommon, in the sense that they’re one of the few teams that has a legitimate shot at winning the NBA Finals.
“As we progress, I think the message is that comfort will kill you,” Brown said after scoring a team-high 41 points.
Things just feel different this year between Tatum and Brown as the Celtics stars continue to build their chemistry, Brown said.

Brown scored season-high 41 points and had 12 rebounds while Tatum had 31 points and 10 rebounds as the Celtics won their fourth straight game.
“I think I can get to the rim at a good rate this year,” Brown told reporters afterwards, per the Celtics website.
“I don’t want to let the defense off the hook, but I feel good about a lot of the shots I took from three.
“They continue to grow in front of our eyes,” Horford said of the star duo after the victory.

     Summary: BOSTON — After the Celtics lost in embarrassing fashion to the Thunder last week, all the warning bells of a talented-yet-complacent team went off.
But the Celtics didn’t relax as they also missed two starters, putting together a complete effort led by Jaylen Brown’s season-high 41 points.
The recent results have all been positive for the Celtics as they built up a league-best 30-12 record.
“As we progress, I think the message is that comfort will kill you,” Brown said.
Other nights are easier as the wins stack up — but that’s where Brown said they can run into complacency.
