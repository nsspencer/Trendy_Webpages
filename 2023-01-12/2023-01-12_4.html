     Celtics confirm injury that Jaylen Brown alluded to after win over Pelicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jaylen Brown is injured, but it doesn’t appear to be a big deal.
The Celtics guard alluded to a groin injury suffered during Wednesday night’s win over the New Orleans Pelicans, in which he dropped a season-high 41 points.
As of Thursday afternoon, he’s officially listed as questionable for the Celtics’ next game, Thursday against the Brooklyn Nets.
He’s listed with left adductor tightness.
“I tweaked my groin a little bit, so I was done,” Brown told NBC Sports Boston’s Abby Chinn after the game.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As two Celtics starters return, another two might not play in Thursday's game vs. the Nets.
Williams got his first start of the 2022-23 campaign in Monday's 107-99 win vs. the Bulls.
It also made sense to have Horford against Jonas Valanciunas on Wednesday and Robert Williams to deal with Nic Claxton and protect the rim against Kyrie Irving on Thursday.
On the heels of Boston's win against New Orleans, Brown shared with NBC Sports Boston's Abby Chin that he tweaked his groin during the game.
Inside The Celtics will have content related to the game coming out before, during, and afterward.

     Why Celtics’ Jaylen Brown says ‘comfort can kill you’ as Boston looks for consistency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — After the Celtics lost in embarrassing fashion to the Thunder last week, all the warning bells of a talented-yet-complacent team went off.
But the Celtics didn’t relax as they also missed two starters, putting together a complete effort led by Jaylen Brown’s season-high 41 points.
The recent results have all been positive for the Celtics as they built up a league-best 30-12 record.
“As we progress, I think the message is that comfort will kill you,” Brown said.
Other nights are easier as the wins stack up — but that’s where Brown said they can run into complacency.

     Summary: Celtics ‘Comfort will kill you’: The Celtics are showing they’re hungry for more than the NBA’s best record Halfway through the season, Boston's record is the NBA's best.
But, this year’s Celtics team isn’t like most.
They’re uncommon, in the sense that they’re one of the few teams that has a legitimate shot at winning the NBA Finals.
“As we progress, I think the message is that comfort will kill you,” Brown said after scoring a team-high 41 points.
Things just feel different this year between Tatum and Brown as the Celtics stars continue to build their chemistry, Brown said.

Brown scored 18 points in the third quarter alone en route to a season-high 41-point night.
Brown also had 12 rebounds on the night, which put him in a rather exclusive group of Celtics.
As noted by ESPN Stats &amp; Info, Brown became just the sixth Celtics player to have multiple 40-point, 10-rebounds games.
Jaylen Brown had 41 points and 12 rebounds in the Celtics 125-114 win over the Pelicans.
