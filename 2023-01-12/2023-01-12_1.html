     Why Celtics’ Jaylen Brown says ‘comfort can kill you’ as Boston looks for consistency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — After the Celtics lost in embarrassing fashion to the Thunder last week, all the warning bells of a talented-yet-complacent team went off.
But the Celtics didn’t relax as they also missed two starters, putting together a complete effort led by Jaylen Brown’s season-high 41 points.
The recent results have all been positive for the Celtics as they built up a league-best 30-12 record.
“As we progress, I think the message is that comfort will kill you,” Brown said.
Other nights are easier as the wins stack up — but that’s where Brown said they can run into complacency.

     Summary: Celtics ‘Comfort will kill you’: The Celtics are showing they’re hungry for more than the NBA’s best record Halfway through the season, Boston's record is the NBA's best.
But, this year’s Celtics team isn’t like most.
They’re uncommon, in the sense that they’re one of the few teams that has a legitimate shot at winning the NBA Finals.
“As we progress, I think the message is that comfort will kill you,” Brown said after scoring a team-high 41 points.
Things just feel different this year between Tatum and Brown as the Celtics stars continue to build their chemistry, Brown said.

Boston will hit the road to take on the rival Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center with tip-off scheduled for 7:30 p.m.
Thursday's tilt is the second night of a back-to-back for Boston who took down the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night at TD Garden, 125-114.
Boston Celtics -2.5 (-118)The Celtics may be on the second night of a back-to-back, but Thursday's showdown will be test nonetheless.
Boston and Brooklyn are the top two teams in the Eastern Conference so one could foresee Thursday's matchup as being a preview for the postseason.

     Summary: CNN —The Boston Celtics became the first team in the NBA this season to reach 30 wins after beating the New Orleans Pelicans 125-114 at TD Garden in Boston on Wednesday night, largely behind a combined 72 points from the team’s stars, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.
Brown scored season-high 41 points and had 12 rebounds while Tatum had 31 points and 10 rebounds as the Celtics won their fourth straight game.
“I think I can get to the rim at a good rate this year,” Brown told reporters afterwards, per the Celtics website.
“I don’t want to let the defense off the hook, but I feel good about a lot of the shots I took from three.
“They continue to grow in front of our eyes,” Horford said of the star duo after the victory.

Brown scored 18 points in the third quarter alone en route to a season-high 41-point night.
Brown also had 12 rebounds on the night, which put him in a rather exclusive group of Celtics.
As noted by ESPN Stats &amp; Info, Brown became just the sixth Celtics player to have multiple 40-point, 10-rebounds games.

     Summary: A season-high 41 points from Jaylen Brown was just what the Celtics needed Wednesday night at TD Garden, as Joe Mazzulla’s squad became the first NBA team to hit the 30-win mark this season thanks to a 125-114 win over the Pelicans.
This was an old fashioned Jaylen takeover, too, as nothing was slowing Brown down in this contest.
“When [Brown] drives, I feel like people feel it,” Celtics big man Al Horford said.
“I feel good about a lot of the shots that I’ve taken from three, some of them haven’t went down [and] some of them have.
But I definitely still think I’m gonna look to get to the basket a lot more for sure.

     Summary: He’s held the interior down for the Nets all season long, and he’s due for a battle tonight.
As Lachard Binkley explained over at the mothership:Do the Nets need him to start scoring 20 points a game?
The gravity Irving and Durant draw is usually the Nets best offense, making it easier for everyone on the court with them.
Second, you have the Brooklyn Nets first attempt at life after Kevin Durant, as he’s out with an MCL injury.
So I am going to take the Celtics with the +3 on this one, but I see it being a high-scoring affair.
