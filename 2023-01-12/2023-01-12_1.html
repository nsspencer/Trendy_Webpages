Lisa Marie Presley, pictured at the Golden Globes on Tuesday, reportedly was hospitalized Thursday after suspected cardiac arrest.
“Lisa Marie and Priscilla, I love you forever.”Butler’s impersonation did not seem to bother Priscilla or Lisa Marie, both of whom appeared emotional throughout his oration.
Lisa Marie owned and operated Elvis Presley Enterprises until 2005, when she sold off the entire portfolio of businesses; however, she remains the owner of Graceland, Elvis’ famed Memphis estate.
Lisa Marie is the daughter of Elvis and Priscilla.
