     Cover Reveal: 'Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret.' by Judy Blume
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s Me, Margaret., Judy Blume famously refused all offers for a film adaptation.
Once Blume met Fremon Craig and her mentor James L. Brooks (who produced the film along with Blume), she understood that their vision of Margaret matched her own.
Chanda said, “It’s important that [Margaret] feel fresh and relevant to modern kids, and doesn’t feel exclusively nostalgic.
Judy felt that this was a design that will catch you on the shelves, and one you will remember.
In a fireside chat with Blume prior to the screening, Today co-host Jenna Bush Hager said, “Judy Blume is an exceptional writer and she’s really the first person who told a lot of us the truth.
