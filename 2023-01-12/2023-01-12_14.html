     Ben Simmons Mocked by Twitter for Not Scoring as Nets Lose to Jayson Tatum, Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AP Photo/Wilfredo LeeThe Brooklyn Nets are going to need Kevin Durant to compete with the Boston Celtics come playoff time.
While the Nets didn't have Durant because of a knee injury, Jaylen Brown was sidelined on the other side with an adductor strain.
However, none of that scoring came from Ben Simmons, who failed to notch a single point while going 0-of-3 from the field.
However, it became more difficult to compete as the game progressed with the Celtics not having to worry about Simmons as a scorer.
He will get another chance to do just that Sunday when the Nets host the Oklahoma City Thunder.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Durant’s absence, could the team’s other stars — specifically Ben Simmons — take on more of an offensive role?
Matt Brooks for Nets Daily and former Nets reporter Billy Reinhardt both lauded Simmons’ play during the game.
Ben Simmons has been terrific — Matt Brooks (@MattBrooksNBA) January 13, 2023Ben Simmons is playing a near perfect game without scoring.
Durant’s scoring will be hard to make up.
If the Nets are going to continue winning with Durant out, Simmons will need to be much better.

     Ben Simmons takes a bagel vs. Celtics, joins his own coach in dubious statistical club
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the Brooklyn Nets, no one player can replace the production of Kevin Durant, who is reportedly out for the next month, maybe more, with a sprained MCL.
From a scoring standpoint, things didn't go so well for Simmons in Brooklyn's first game since KD's injury.
He was the only Brooklyn player to post a positive point differential: plus-10 in 26 minutes.
Throw in Simmons' nine rebounds along with 13 assists and zero points, and the club shrinks to just three: Norm Van Lier in 1971, Tomas Satoransky and now Simmons.
A lot of guys put up 13 assists and nine boards in a game.

     Summary: MORE: Latest updates on Kevin Durant's knee injuryThe good: Ben Simmons assistsWe'll start with the glass-half full approach.
The bad: Ben Simmons foul troubleUnfortunately, foul trouble derailed Simmons.
Three possessions after picking up his fifth, Simmons drove and avoided contact, passing up an easy runner and instead throwing the ball out of bounds.
The ugly: Ben Simmons benched in 4th quarterWith 7:00 left in the fourth quarter and the Nets now down 12, Jacque Vaughn subbed Simmons out in favor of Seth Curry.
Brooklyn needed buckets to crawl back in it and at that point in the game, Simmons scoreless on 0-3 shooting with zero trips to the free throw line.

     Ben Simmons: 'I Need to Get Buckets' with Kevin Durant Out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a crucial quarter where Brooklyn only tallied 16 points and have Boston steal the contest, it was also the first example of why Ben Simmons needs to look to score with Kevin Durant sidelined.
I think I was giving the ball a few too many times," Simmons said postgame.
I think it’s something I need to do to help the team," said Simmons on looking to score.
"We’re not gonna let this one particular game or any other games where he scored eight points, four points, it doesn’t matter.
The Nets' head coach Jacque Vaughn echoed a similar statement, shooting down the heavy need for Simmons to score.
