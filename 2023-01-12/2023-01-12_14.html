     Odell Beckham Jr. Addresses Video of Him Being Removed from Flight in November: 'Exhausting'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Odell Beckham Jr. has spoken out about the newly released footage showing him being removed from an American Airlines flight in November.
When one officer told Beckham the crew would have "deplane everyone" from the aircraft, including him, if he continued to refuse, he responded, "That's fine."
Daniel Davillier, an attorney for Beckham, told ESPN that his client had been sleeping and the incident was due to an "overzealous flight attendant."
"At no time was Mr. Beckham disruptive or combative," Davillier said.
"He was willing to comply with the seatbelt requirement, but the flight attendant wanted to prove that he had the authority to have Mr. Beckham removed from the flight.
