    </h2>

     Summary: articleGoodbye, Sierra Mist.
PepsiCo has launched a new lemon-lime soda to replace its Sierra Mist brand, a less popular rival of Coca-Cola’s Sprite.

     Pepsi lemon-lime soda Sierra Mist discontinued, replaced with citrus-flavored Starry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pepsi has discontinued its lemon-lime soda Sierra Mist, and is rolling out a new citrus-flavored competitor to Coca-Cola brand Sprite called Starry, the company has announced.
Sierra Mist failed to keep up with Sprite in the $82 billion soda market.
Whereas Sprite controls around 7% of market share according to Bloomberg, Sierra Mist sales were a mere 0.1% of that market in 2022.
Sierra Mist, launched in 1999, was not able to break through.
To break the new brand into the beverage market, Pepsi offered their partners a guide on the soda’s appeal to consumers.

     Pepsi discontinues Sierra Mist, unveils new soda Starry to compete with Sprite
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pepsi launched a new lemon-lime soda called Starry on Wednesday to replace its Sierra Mist beverage and compete against Coca-Cola's Sprite.
Some have already hit store shelves as the soda made its social media debut on Wednesday.
A PepsiCo representative described the soda, claiming it has "higher citrus flavors that are true to fruit and more aromatic which delivers a more balanced, cleaner, crisp finish than Sierra Mist."
This comes after the Federal Trade Commission launched a preliminary investigation into whether PepsiCo violated a law regulating pricing strategies.
As of December 2021, the company employed 309,000 people globally and roughly 129,000 in the United States.

     Pepsi Takes Yet Another Stab at Lemon Lime Soda
    </h2>

     Summary: Product shot of Starry Lemon Lime soda, both regular and zero sugarPepsiCo has announced the launch a new lemon lime soda called Starry, which will replace its former lemon lime product, Sierra Mist.
In 2016 Sierra Mist rebranded as “Mist Twist,” ditching cane sugar and stevia and reverting back to high fructose corn syrup.
And if you think that’s a headache, realize that Sierra Mist was not even PepsiCo’s first foray into the lemon lime beverage category.
Then came Storm, yet another attempt to reinvigorate PepsiCo’s presence in the lemon lime space.
Starry and the future of PepsiCo lemon lime sodaWill Starry be the lemon lime soda that finally sticks?
