     Nets: Kyrie Irving stern take after falling flat without Kevin Durant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That wasn’t the case for the Brooklyn Nets in their first game since their star was sidelined with injury, falling to the Boston Celtics on Thursday.
The defensive focus shifted completely to Kyrie Irving, who managed to put up 24 points but largely struggled from the field.
The Nets guard shot 9 of 24 from the field and went 3 of 11 from beyond the arc.
Irving spoke out on his takeaways from the loss after the game:“I think I took from it is just not to be discouraged,” said Kyrie Irving after the Nets loss.
Nets head coach Jacque Vaughn was vocal on not wanting to add any additional pressure on Kyrie Irving to produce in KD’s absence, but it’s clear that they’re going to need him to step up in order to stay afloat.

     Summary: Seth Curry scored 11 points, and Ben Simmons went scoreless but dished out 13 assists, a season high, and had nine rebounds.
(Mary Altaffer / Associated Press)Before Durant went down, Vaughn said he wanted Simmons to play with force on every possession.
Asked afterward about his play, Simmons said Durant’s absence wasn’t necessarily a reason to be more aggressive.
Against the Celtics, Vaughn said that was lacking at times, too.
Got to accept that.”(Top photo of Kyrie Irving reacting after committing a foul against the Celtics: Wendell Cruz / USA Today)

     Summary: While coach Jacque Vaughn believes everyone has to step up during Durant's absence, the majority of the pressure will fall on Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons.
Entering the Boston game, Simmons was averaging 3.2 drives a game.
Without Durant, Vaughn says the Nets need Simmons to be more aggressive.
And so that becomes a habit that you consistently [do] from possession to possession and game to game.
And looking forward to it.”And then we have Irving, who becomes the undisputed leader of the Nets now that Durant is out.

     Nets’ Kyrie Irving says loss to Celtics was because Boston ‘picked up their pressure’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving has a tough job ahead of him for at least the next month.
In Thursday’s 109-98 loss to the Boston Celtics, Irving scored 24 points, but it came on 9-of-24 shooting from the field and 3-of-11 shooting from behind the three-point line.
Irving started the game well as he was able to string successful offensive possessions together, but in the second half, Boston’s defense was too much for Irving and the Nets to overcome.
So, they (the Celtics) won the race to get the fourth quarter started off aggressive.
