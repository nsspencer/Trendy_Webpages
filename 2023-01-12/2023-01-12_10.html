     NFL teams are inquiring on Mike LaFleur, brother of Packers HC Matt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh, former offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur wasn’t fired but was let go to pursue other opportunities.
Mike, younger brother of Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur, was actually the elder LaFleur’s first call for an offensive coordinator interview when Matt was named head coach of the Packers back in 2019.
At the time, 49ers head coach Mike Shanahan blocked an interview request from the Packers, Cleveland Browns and Minnesota Vikings for their coordinator openings.
Add Mike LaFleur to the list of potential names who may assist a poorly-performing Packers red zone offense to bounce back in 2023.
His former offensive coordinator, Nathaniel Hackett, was recently fired by the Denver Broncos.

     Summary: Jets, OC Mike LaFleur agree to part waysFLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- After a season marked by profound struggles on offense and the regression of quarterback Zach Wilson, the New York Jets and offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur parted ways.
"He's going to be fine," Jets coach Robert Saleh said Thursday.
LaFleur is the younger brother of Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur, one of Saleh's closest friends.
A week ago, Saleh publicly advocated for Mike LaFleur, fueling speculation that owner Woody Johnson was pressuring to make a change.
Garrett Wilson hinted the Jets' offense became too predictable.

     Mike LaFleur parts ways with Jets, should draw interest from the Saints
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the New Orleans Saints don’t currently have a coaching staff position available, there is a chance they open up a search at offensive coordinator this offseason.
If they do, one of their top candidates may have just hit the market in former New York Jets offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur.
Once rookie back Breece Hall was ruled out for the season with injury, everything changed for LaFleur’s offense.
The same could happen for LaFleur while the Saints roster is under reconstruction at major positions like quarterback.
Early in the season, the Saints and Jets were on opposite sides of the spectrum when it came to pre-snap motion.

     AP source: Mike LaFleur out as Jets’ offensive coordinator
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FILE - New York Jets offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur stands on the field as players practice during the NFL football team's training camp May 6, 2022, in Florham Park, N.J. LaFleur is out as offensive coordinator of the Jets after two seasons, according to a person with knowledge of the decision.
(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) APMike LaFleur is out as offensive coordinator of the New York Jets after two disappointing and mostly non-productive seasons on offense, according to a person with knowledge of the decision.
The 36-year-old LaFleur, the younger brother of Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur, was a first-time coordinator when he joined Saleh and the Jets in 2021.
LaFleur was the 49ers’ passing game coordinator for four seasons — while Saleh was the defensive coordinator — before leaving to join Saleh’s staff as the Jets’ offensive coordinator.
None could provide consistent success on offense, and LaFleur didn’t appear to do enough to compensate for the issues at quarterback.
