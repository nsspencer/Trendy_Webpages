     Celtics' Jaylen Brown sidelined with right adductor strain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celtics guard Jaylen Brown did not play in Boston’s 109-98 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday due to right adductor tightness.
He may not return to the court for another “week or two,” per Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla.
Halfway through the NBA season, Brown is averaging a career-high 27.2 points and making nearly half (49.8%) of his shots from the field.
The Celtics play eight games over the next two weeks, six of which are on the road.
Boston (31-12) has a 3-game lead for first place after winning five straight games, including Thursday’s win over second-plae Brooklyn (27-14).

(2:08)NEW YORK -- Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown missed Thursday night's 109-98 Celtics win over the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center with a right adductor strain, an injury that could cause him to miss "a week or two," per Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla.

     Summary: NEW YORK — The Celtics were shorthanded Thursday night against the Nets, as Jaylen Brown was downgraded to out because of adductor tightness.
With Brown out, expect the Celtics to spread out his minutes to Malcolm Brogdon, Derrick White and perhaps Payton Pritchard.
Robert Williams III (left knee injury rehabilitation) was back in the lineup after sitting out Wednesday’s game for precautionary reasons.
The next fan voting update is on Jan. 19 and voting will conclude on Jan. 21.
Brown also trails Brooklyn’s Kyrie Irving and Cleveland’s Donovan Mitchell in fan voting.

Things just feel different this year between Tatum and Brown as the Celtics stars continue to build their chemistry, Brown said.
