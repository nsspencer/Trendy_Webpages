     Celtics injury report: Jaylen Brown out against Nets due to adductor tightness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — The Celtics will be shorthanded when they take on the Nets as Jaylen Brown was downgraded to out because of adductor tightness.
He was crucial in the Celtics extending their winning streak to four games as Brown enjoys a career-best season.
Boston does return Robert Williams III (left knee injury rehabilitation), who sat out Wednesday’s game for precautionary reasons.
The Celtics take on the Nets at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in Brooklyn looking to tack onto their winning streak.
The Nets will play their first game without Kevin Durant as he suffered a knee injury last Sunday.

     Jaylen Brown's Final Injury Status for Celtics vs Nets Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It seems like the big matchup between the Brooklyn Nets and Boston Celtics may be a little bit more even-sided.
It's been revealed that Jaylen Brown has now been downgraded to out with an adductor strain against the Brooklyn Nets.
Both teams will now be missing a big gun, as the Celtics will be missing Jaylen Brown and the Nets will be missing Kevin Durant.
The last time the Brooklyn Nets and Boston Celtics faced off was a great measuring stick for the Nets, where they realized they still weren't quite a great team yet.
That game was on December 4, and since that moment, the Brooklyn Nets have improved to become a great team.

     Boston Celtics' Jaylen Brown sidelined with adductor strain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum put on a show in the Celtics' definitive win over the Pelicans Wednesday night.
(2:08)NEW YORK -- Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown will miss Thursday night's game at Barclays Center in Brooklyn against the Nets with a right adductor strain, and he could miss "a week or two," per Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla.
"I anticipate it being pretty short," Mazzulla said before Thursday night's game, when asked how long Brown -- who was ruled out a little over 90 minutes before tip -- would be sidelined.
Mazzulla said Brown tried to warm up to play Thursday but was deemed unable to go.
Brown, 26, is averaging career highs in both points (27.2 per game) and field goal percentage (49.8%) this season for Boston, which entered Thursday's game against Brooklyn with the NBA's best record.

Brown scored 18 points in the third quarter alone en route to a season-high 41-point night.
Brown also had 12 rebounds on the night, which put him in a rather exclusive group of Celtics.
As noted by ESPN Stats &amp; Info, Brown became just the sixth Celtics player to have multiple 40-point, 10-rebounds games.
Jaylen Brown had 41 points and 12 rebounds in the Celtics 125-114 win over the Pelicans.

     Summary: CNN —The Boston Celtics became the first team in the NBA this season to reach 30 wins after beating the New Orleans Pelicans 125-114 at TD Garden in Boston on Wednesday night, largely behind a combined 72 points from the team’s stars, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.
Brown scored season-high 41 points and had 12 rebounds while Tatum had 31 points and 10 rebounds as the Celtics won their fourth straight game.
“I think I can get to the rim at a good rate this year,” Brown told reporters afterwards, per the Celtics website.
“I don’t want to let the defense off the hook, but I feel good about a lot of the shots I took from three.
“They continue to grow in front of our eyes,” Horford said of the star duo after the victory.

But, this year’s Celtics team isn’t like most.
They’re uncommon, in the sense that they’re one of the few teams that has a legitimate shot at winning the NBA Finals.
“As we progress, I think the message is that comfort will kill you,” Brown said after scoring a team-high 41 points.
Things just feel different this year between Tatum and Brown as the Celtics stars continue to build their chemistry, Brown said.
