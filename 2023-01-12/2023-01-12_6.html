     With 'Flowers,' Miley Cyrus Ushers In an Assured New Era
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When it comes to Miley Cyrus, you should always expect the unexpected.
Since departing her reign on Disney Channel, she’s delivered one curveball after the next—and her latest single, “Flowers,” is no different.
Miley Cyrus is all grown up—and it shows.
Thematically, “Flowers” is a classic breakup anthem where Cyrus realizes she’s fine on her own.
If my suspicions are correct, Endless Summer will mark a new era for Cyrus: one of healing, renewal, and perhaps, a bit of revenge.

     Miley Cyrus' "Flowers" Lyrics Show She's Still Moving On From Liam Hemsworth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The arrival of “Flowers,” the lead single of her upcoming album Endless Summer Vacation, however, isn’t exactly that — but isn’t not exactly that either.
Though it’s never directly stated, clues overwhelmingly point to Liam Hemsworth, Miley’s ex-husband and the man who appears to be the big heartbreak of her life.
The song starts on a wistful note, reminiscing about a past relationship that ends on the biggest signifier that she’s talking about Hemsworth.
That last line undoubtedly feels like a direct reference to Hemsworth and Cyrus' shared Malibu home, which they devastatingly lost in 2018 to the Woosley fires.
And maybe, Cyrus wrote “Flowers” many years ago, when the wound was still fresher.

     Miley Cyrus drops new song 'Flowers' on Liam Hemsworth's birthday — is it a diss track?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Miley Cyrus has planted some clever seeds in the lyrical garden of "Flowers," her new song that many fans have interpreted as about her relationship with ex-husband and Australian actor Liam Hemsworth.
Speculation began when Cyrus dropped the song on Jan. 13 — the Hunger Games star's 33rd birthday.
Another user spliced the song's lyrics together with Bruno Mars' 2012 song "When I Was Your Man," which sees him singing about missing a departed partner.
Cyrus' lyrics are strikingly similar: "I can buy myself flowers, and I can hold my own hand.

     Miley Cyrus’ Lead Singles, Ranked: Critic’s Picks

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Miley Cyrus announced that she would be kicking off 2023 with the release of “Flowers,” a new single to precede her forthcoming album Endless Summer Vacation, the news was exciting on two levels: a new Cyrus single was coming, but perhaps more importantly, a new Cyrus lead single was coming.
So which lead singles illustrate Cyrus’ pop power most effectively, especially now that there’s a new one to consider?
All eight of Cyrus’ lead singles have their charms — truly, not a flat-out dud in the bunch — but some of her songs excel as both previews of their host albums and standalone gems in her catalog.
And while it’s still early days for “Flowers,” we tried our best to consider its place among Cyrus’ lead singles to date, and humbly rank the new track among the seven that have stood tall for years.
Here are Miley Cyrus’ lead singles, ranked.

Miley came on the scene with hardcore energy and gave the girls a bop that she herself is still obsessed with to this day.
06 “Don’t Call Me Angel” To this day, “Don’t Call Me Angel” is a misunderstood bop.
However, what I can’t deny is the quality of its music video, which sees Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande, and Lana Del Rey teaming up for some fallen angel fun.
In this era, Miley was in the early throes of her mesmerizing rockstar alter ego.
