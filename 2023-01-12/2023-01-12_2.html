     Meyers Leonard to work out with Los Angeles Lakers on Friday: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Free-agent center Meyers Leonard will work out for the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday, league sources told The Athletic on Thursday.
The Lakers have searched for potential shooting and size, with Leonard and DeMarcus Cousins set for free-agent workouts Friday.
Leonard and Cousins, both of whom Los Angeles will work out on Friday, address needs as stretch-5s that can soak up minutes in the paint.
Leonard (39.0 percent career 3-point shooter) can both pick-and-pop and spot up beyond the arc.
Sterling Brown is currently on a 10-day contract with Los Angeles.

     Summary: Christian Wood added 24 points and 14 rebounds in the Mavs' fourth straight win over the Lakers.
“We knew we weren’t out of it,” said Tim Hardaway Jr., who had 22 points and eight rebounds.
“I'm more tired now,” said Doncic, who rested for only 9 seconds in the final 40 minutes of play.
“I was a little bit surprised (because) I thought they were going to foul, honestly,” Doncic said.
The Lakers pressured Doncic again in the first overtime, and Westbrook was called for a flagrant foul midway through the period.

     Lakers News: Controversial Veteran Big Man To Work Out For LA This Week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sources inform Shams Charania of The Athletic that nine-year veteran center Meyers Leonard is going to audition for LA this Friday.
Leonard will be the second confirmed center that the Lakers are set to work out tomorrow, as it was also announced earlier today that LA is also taking a look at former four-time All-Star five DeMarcus Cousins.
The former All-Defensive Team honoree actually signed with LA in 2019 but never played a second for the team due to a preseason ACL tear.
Leonard quickly apologized for the incident (unlike some other hypothetical future Lakers), and was enrolled in a cultural diversity program by the NBA.
Leonard boasts a sparkling 39% three-pointer conversion rate on 1.9 tries a night over the duration of his career.

     Lakers will reportedly work out Meyers Leonard, who has been out of NBA since 2021 after anti-semitic slur
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers are working out Meyers Leonard on Friday to potentially join their roster, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania.
Leonard, a nine-year NBA veteran who has played for the Portland Trail Blazers and Miami Heat, has been out of the NBA since early 2021, when he used an anti-semitic slur during a video game live stream.
The team pursued Kyrie Irving in an offseason trade but ultimately failed to acquire him.
Earlier this season, Nets guard Kyrie Irving was suspended after sharing a link to an anti-semitic documentary on his social media platforms.
Irving is a free agent after the season, and the Lakers were linked to him in trade talks in the offseason.

     Summary: Center Meyers Leonard will work out for Lakers on FridayWith Anthony Davis still rehabbing from a stress injury in his right foot, the Los Angeles Lakers could use some viable frontcourt depth.
The team reportedly worked out center Cody Zeller, and it is also planning on taking a look at veteran center DeMarcus Cousins.
Another big man the Lakers are planning on working out, according to Shams Charania (h/t Lakers Daily), is Meyers Leonard.
Leonard has been a productive rebounder over the years who also added a potent 3-point shot to his arsenal.
The big man has apparently made amends for the incident, and he met with Jewish leaders shortly afterward in order to grow and learn from it.

     Summary: The Lakers are set to work out free agent center Meyers Leonard on Friday, sources inform Shams Charania of The Athletic (Twitter link).
The seven-footer out of Illinois enjoyed a nine-year NBA career as a backup for the Trail Blazers and Heat, before injuries and controversy ended his run in 2021.
While recovering from season-ending surgeries to his shoulder and ankle in 2021, Leonard used an antisemitic slur during a live stream of a video game on Twitch.
To his credit, Leonard completed training in a league-mandated cultural diversity program and has since apologized for his behavior.
Charania adds (via Twitter) that Leonard has since logged significant time with Jewish leaders and been involved with the Jewish community.

     Lakers: Luka Doncic, Christian Wood Overpower LA In Physical Double-OT Dallas Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tonight, at a sold-out Crypto.com Arena, your Los Angeles Lakers managed to grind their way back from a 19-point Dallas Mavericks lead to push the Dallas Mavericks to not one, but two overtime periods... before ultimately running out of steam late against, frankly, a better club.
Mavericks All-Star guard Luka Doncic, starting center Christian Wood, and possible trade target small forward Tim Hardaway Jr. led the way for Dallas with nine points apiece.
A terrible free-throw shooting night for the Lakers (63% on 17-of-27 shooting) was salvaged only by an even worse free-throw shooting night for the Mavericks, on significantly lower volume (52.9% on 9-of-17 shooting).
The Lakers' shooting from the floor in general (39.3%) was significantly worse than the Mavericks' (50%).
Luka Doncic notched a high-scoring triple-double 35 points on 14-of-28 shooting from the floor, pulling down 14 boards, and dished out 13 dimes.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: National Basketball Association Lakers will work out DeMarcus Cousins, Meyers Leonard on Friday 8 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit linkThe Los Angeles Lakers will hold free-agent workouts for four-time NBA All-Star DeMarcus Cousins and veteran center Meyers Leonard on Friday, according to reports.
Sterling Brown, who played for the Dallas Mavericks during the 2021-22 season, signed a 10-day contract with the Lakers on Jan. 6.
On paper, it doesn't make much sense for the Lakers to sign another center, as they currently employ three in Anthony Davis, Thomas Bryant and Damian Jones.
That opens the door for Cousins or Leonard to be the Lakers' true backup center.
Neither Cousins nor Leonard have played in the NBA this season.
