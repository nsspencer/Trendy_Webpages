     Summary: The bond market had trouble making up its mind following the latest consumer price index report, which revealed inflation continues to moderate, though not across the board.
“Bottom line, the continued drop in goods prices is offsetting continued acceleration in service prices,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, wrote in an email.

     Dow climbs more than 200 points after December CPI report shows cooling inflation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stocks advanced Thursday after December's consumer price report came in line with economist expectations and showed signs of cooling inflation.
The December report showed a 0.1% dip in prices from November but was still 6.5% higher than the prior year.
In November, the report showed a 0.1% monthly gain and an annual pace of 7.1%.
Stocks rallied in recent sessions as investors bet the CPI report would confirm a weakening inflation trend.
"This push and pull is going to be maintained for a few weeks," Roberts said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Consumer prices slowed further in December, boosting hopes that the worst of red-hot inflation is behind the U.S.
The annual inflation rate fell from 7.1 percent in November to 6.5 percent in December, according to the consumer price index, released Thursday morning.
Prices fell 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent in November.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, inflation rose 5.7 percent over the last 12 months ending in December and 0.3 percent on a month-to-month basis.
Consumer price inflation for December couldn’t have been much better,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi tweeted.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Excluding volatile food and energy prices, co-called core CPI rose 0.3%, also meeting expectations.
Even with the decline, headline CPI rose 6.5% from a year ago, highlighting the persistent burden that the rising cost of living has placed on U.S. households.
The consumer price index , which measures the cost of a broad basket of goods and services, fell 0.1% for the month, in line with the Dow Jones estimate.
Inflation closed out 2022 in a modest retreat, with consumer prices in December posting their biggest monthly decline since early in the pandemic, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
Medical care services increased 0.1% after dropping for two straight months, while apparel prices rose 0.5% and transportation services were up 0.2% and are still 14.6% higher from a year ago.

     Summary: Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the core CPI rose by an annualized 5.7% in December.
However, some recent comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank remains committed to rate hikes in order to quell inflation.
"Markets have remained confident the Fed will be able to control inflation, but that remains to be seen," she said.
"The (CPI) is just one measure of inflation, and it's calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics with a large component being owner-occupied rent.
CPI is not the only way to measure inflation."

Meanwhile, used car prices fell 2.5%, the sixth straight monthly decline and are now down 8.8% annually after increasing sharply earlier in the pandemic.
The labor market is closely monitored by Fed policymakers, who raised interest rates seven times last year in a bid to slow job growth and bring down stubbornly high inflation.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The annual rate of price increases was the slowest since October 2021.
Inflation is still well above normal levels, and the economy remains vulnerable to shocks that could send prices back up.
Prices for used cars and trucks fell 2.5 percent in December, the sixth consecutive month of declines.
Economists have many ways to look under the hood of the inflation report to tease out whether supply chains are improving or if worker shortages are putting pressure on prices.
“And indeed, three months of outright declines — that is spectacular news.”If a trend toward lower price increases is in the making, there’s a long way to go.

     Summary: The closely watched inflation gauge also showed that year-over-year prices continued to cool last month, slowing to 6.5%, from 7.1% in November.
Thursday’s CPI report showed just that … and then some.
Most notably, food prices grew at the smallest monthly rate since March of 2021, BLS data shows.
But that’s still higher than overall inflation, with prices up 11.8% annually in December and certain products considerably higher.
In addition to food prices still being on the rise, core inflation picked up 0.3% in December from November.
