     Summary: Alabama and Kansas State have zero shared history.
They do, however, share a notable footnote in college football history -- one Kansas State would much rather forget.
Newly-top-ranked Kansas State went to 4-5 Baylor only to take a stunning 52-24 beating.
That Kansas State loss paired with No.
Over in Kansas City, a then-11-year-old Cooper Beebe was a big Kansas State fan.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sadly enough Alabama’s 2022 football season will come to an end on Saturday afternoon at the conclusion of the Allstate Sugar Bowl.
Although the season has been a slight disappointment, Nick Saban and the Crimson Tide can right the ship and end the year on a high note with a victory over the Big 12 champs, the Kansas State Wildcats.
Alabama will be challenged on both sides of the ball by a Kansas State team that plays an old-school, physical style of football which was enough to beat the playoff-bound TCU Horned Frogs.
Here are five bold predictions for the Allstate Sugar Bowl matchup between the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Kansas State Wildcats.

     Alabama vs. Kansas State: 5 final thoughts and a prediction on the Sugar Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is somewhat humorous for anyone old enough to even think about the words “consolation prize” and “Sugar Bowl” in the same sentence.
So yes, the Sugar Bowl was once hardly a consolation destination.
Those prized recruits are seeing what Alabama football offers, even at the end of a “down” year.
With that, here are 5 final thoughts on Alabama’s Sugar Bowl showdown with No.
With opt-outs not tearing down this Sugar Bowl like some other bowl games, everyone is all in, and that means these defenses aren’t decimated like they easily could have been.
