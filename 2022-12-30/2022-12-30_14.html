     Georgia Football Players Use NIL Money for Good
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ahead of their College Football Playoff semifinal game at the Peach Bowl against Ohio State, several Georgia football players used NIL deals to make the holiday season a little brighter for deserving children.
Offensive lineman Micah Morris began the trend when he used his NIL money to take families from the Boys and Girls Club of Athens on a shopping spree to purchase over 100 Christmas presents for those in need.
Bennett was one of many high-profile college athletes to ink an NIL deal with Fanatics-owned Topps to sell his trading cards earlier this year.
The senior QB has an NIL valuation of $1.3 million — tops on the Georgia roster and eighth in all of college football.
Michigan running back Blake Corum — who has been ruled out for the playoff with a knee injury — used his NIL money to deliver 300 turkeys to deserving families on Thanksgiving.
