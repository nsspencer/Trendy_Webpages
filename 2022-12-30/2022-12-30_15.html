     Steven Tyler is sued for alleged 1970s sexual assault of a teen, ahead of legal deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steven Tyler has been sued, along with a number of other defendants, for the alleged sexual assault and sexual battery of a woman who says she met the Aerosmith singer in 1973, when she was 16 and he was 25.
Tyler took the teen and another person to his hotel room after the show, then had the third individual leave so they could be alone, the lawsuit says.
The two had sexual relations again in Seattle, the lawsuit says, and Tyler allegedly pursued her via frequent phone calls and by telling her he had written a song about her.
In 1974, Tyler became the teen’s guardian after making “various promises and inducements” to her mother, the lawsuit says.
In addition to sexual assault and sexual battery, the case alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress.

     Woman sues Steven Tyler, alleging child sex assault in 1970s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES (AP) — A woman who has previously said Steven Tyler had an illicit sexual relationship with her when she was a teenager is now suing the Aerosmith frontman for sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
The lawsuit brought by Julia Misley was filed Tuesday under a 2019 California law that gave adult victims of childhood sexual assault a three-year window to file lawsuits for decades-old instances of assault.
While the lawsuit doesn’t name Tyler, Misley identified him by name in the statement, issued through the law firm Jeff Anderson &amp; Associates.
Tyler further harmed Misley by publishing memoirs that detailed parts of their relationship without her knowledge or consent, the lawsuit alleged.
Tyler’s relationship with a teenage girl is also referenced by several people in “Walk This Way,” a 1997 “autobiography” of Aerosmith in oral history format.

     Steven Tyler Accused of Sexual Assault of a Minor in New Lawsuit Over a Decades-Old Claim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the Seattle show, Tyler allegedly performed more sexual acts on her, and Holcomb flew back to Portland the next morning.
Tyler allegedly told Holcomb’s mother he would provide better support than she was getting at home, promising to enroll her in school and give her medical care.
RelatedAccording to the lawsuit, Holcomb was hesitant about going through with the abortion, but Tyler had threatened to stop supporting her if she didn’t proceed with the procedure.
In the suit, Holcomb says she’s mentioned in the memoir’s acknowledgments which further removed her anonymity.
Since taking effect last month, two women have accused the late record executive Ahmet Ertegun of sexual assault in the 1980s and 1990s.
