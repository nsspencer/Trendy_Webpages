     John Cena Delivers Heartfelt Promo After WWE SmackDown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The anticipation for tonight's WWE SmackDown was high thanks to the return of John Cena, who was coming back to WWE for his one and only match of the year.
He would team with Kevin Owens to take on The Bloodline's Roman Reigns and Sami Zayn, and after getting the win, Cena took a moment to deliver a heartfelt promo after SmackDown went off the air.
Thank you for a wonderful 2022.
This was Cena's only wrestling match of 2022, and in making it happen it keeps his 20-year streak of having at least one match a year going.
If Cena vs Paul does happen, it will make another massively high-profile match for Paul since joining the company.

Reigns and Zayn promised to rid The Bloodline of its Owens problem, but they could not contend with the united front of Owens and Cena.
Tasked with choosing a partner to face Reigns and Zayn, Owens could not have made a more impactful choice than siding with the 16-time world champion.
Cena laid out Reigns with an Attitude Adjustment, after which Owens hit Zayn with a stunner for the pinfall.
Charlotte Flair made a surprise return to WWE, her first appearance since losing to Rousey at WrestleMania Backlash in May.
