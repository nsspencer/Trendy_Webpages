    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Alabama DB Ha Ha Clinton-Dix formally retired from the NFL on Thursday as a Green Bay Packer.
Clinton-Dix was speaking to Packers reporters Friday when he discussed his return to Alabama in a player development role on Nick Saban’s staff.
“I had an opportunity back in October to go down to Tuscaloosa and spend time with the 2012 championship reunion,” Clinton-Dix shared.
After 4-plus seasons with the Packers, his final 25 appearances came with Washington and Chicago in the 2018 and ’19 seasons.
Since the end of the 2019 season, Clinton-Dix has spent time with the Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers, Las Vegas Raiders and Denver Broncos as an offseason/practice squad member.

     Summary: Sadly enough Alabama’s 2022 football season will come to an end on Saturday afternoon at the conclusion of the Allstate Sugar Bowl.
Although the season has been a slight disappointment, Nick Saban and the Crimson Tide can right the ship and end the year on a high note with a victory over the Big 12 champs, the Kansas State Wildcats.
Alabama will be challenged on both sides of the ball by a Kansas State team that plays an old-school, physical style of football which was enough to beat the playoff-bound TCU Horned Frogs.

So yes, the Sugar Bowl was once hardly a consolation destination.
Those prized recruits are seeing what Alabama football offers, even at the end of a “down” year.
With that, here are 5 final thoughts on Alabama’s Sugar Bowl showdown with No.
With opt-outs not tearing down this Sugar Bowl like some other bowl games, everyone is all in, and that means these defenses aren’t decimated like they easily could have been.
