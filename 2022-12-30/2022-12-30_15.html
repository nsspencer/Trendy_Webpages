    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The two own goals consigned Leicester to a second defeat in as many games despite taking the lead at Anfield in the fourth minute.
"I had that once in my career where a player scored two own goals and I really feel for him," Klopp said.
Then the second one, if you play football, you go full speed, you expect the ball to go in.
It was just freakish and he has been unfortunate with the second one also," Rodgers said.
"He has been at the World Cup but didn't play a minute, so it might take him a few games to get his rhythm back.

     Nunez helps Liverpool push Leicester past the limit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Foxes struggled to create any meaningful opportunities as they faced a battle to find a way past Liverpool's high line, which caught out the visitors on a number of occasions.
Liverpool didn't panic after going a goal down, although the manager will be disappointed by the goal his defence conceded.
A careless pass in the first half almost presented Leicester with a big chance before Thiago intervened.
Liverpool beat Leicester on Friday night at Anfield on the back of two Foxes' own-goals, closing the gap to the top four to just two points.
Leicester struggled to deal with the Uruguay international, who was pivotal for Liverpool's second goal.

     Summary: But Liverpool’s acquisition of Cody Gakpo is proof that sporting directors, too, can occasionally get caught up in football’s Christmas chaos.
Initially, that trio will have planned for a quiet Christmas given that attacking reinforcements weren’t supposed to be on the cards for the January window.
Still, while elements of this transfer might have the surface feel of a short-term fix, Liverpool insist the player had been on their radar for a long time.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool moved to within two points of the top four after a 2-1 victory over Leicester City at Anfield in the Premier League.
Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall had put Leicester ahead early on, but Liverpool's comeback was all thanks to two own-goals from the unfortunate Wout Faes.
Liverpool tried to respond as the half went on and after Salah fired wide and then had a goal ruled out, they finally scored.
The second half was fairly comfortable for Liverpool, who could have extended their lead on numerous occasions.
Liverpool held on to make it four league wins in a row and restore their credentials as Champions League contenders.
