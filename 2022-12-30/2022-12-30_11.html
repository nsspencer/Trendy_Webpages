    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Notre Dame and South Carolina combine for the most points in Gator Bowl history as the Fighting Irish take it home 45-38.
19 South Carolina 45-38 in a wild TaxSlayer Bowl on Friday.
The highest-scoring game in Gator Bowl history was filled with big plays and memorable moments.
Notre Dame (9-4) overcame a 14-point deficit and won despite South Carolina's scoring on the two pick-sixes and on special teams.
Notre Dame played without All-American tight end Michael Mayer, standout edge rusher Isaiah Foskey, cornerback Cam Hart and defensive lineman Jayson Ademilola.

     Fighting Irish 4-1-1 - South Carolina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saturday afternoon’s Gator Bowl matinee featuring a pair of resurgent programs, Notre Dame and South Carolina, most closely resembled the Fighting Irish’s debut campaign under first-year coach Marcus Freeman.
The Fighting Irish, despite quarterback Tyler Buchner making just his third career start and first in 16 weeks, were the more poised group – if not quite always the sharpest.
In the second half, everything changed up front for the Fighting Irish.
9, 9: Notre Dame notched nine tackles for losses against South Carolina and added an additional nine quarterback hurries.
But Freeman’s “For The Brotherhood” culture, timely dynamics from individuals, and collective work in all three elements lifted Notre Dame to victory.

Notre Dame is one step closer to an early spring after a 76-65 loss to No.

Miami scored once, twice, three times, then a fourth as Notre Dame came up empty on five straight possessions back from a timeout.
Couple hours earlier, so too in all reality did the Notre Dame men’s basketball team’s chances of getting back to the NCAA tournament.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FIRST HALF*** Notre Dame's run game struggled to get much going early against a South Carolina defense that was clearly prepared for Duo.
South Carolina knew Notre Dame didn't attack this area during the regular season so they weren't ready for it.
SECOND HALF*** Notre Dame was a different animal in the second half.
*** Notre Dame followed that up with another great drive, mixing up the run game and quick perimeter pass game to put another scoring drive together.

     Miami at Notre Dame: Preview and Prediction- ACC Basketball Pick of the Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 14 Miami Hurricanes and Notre Dame Fighting Irish return to ACC play with a Friday afternoon battle in South Bend.
However I can’t back Notre Dame with any level of confidence based on the recent results for these two teams.
Miami looks like one of the top few teams in the league, and I don’t see anyone on Notre Dame having success slowing down Isaiah Wong.
I don’t expect Notre Dame to squander this season completely, but this won't be game where they turn things around.
