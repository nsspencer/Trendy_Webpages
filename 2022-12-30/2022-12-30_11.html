    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SOCCERKarim Benzema’s second chance with Real Madrid in 2023Despite the fact that a large part of the season has passed him by, including the World Cup, Karim Benzema faces 2023 with plenty of challenges ahead.
The Real Madrid striker, who has barely featured in the first half of the LaLiga season, has six months ahead of him to show why he won the Ballon d’Or.
Both Benzema and Real Madrid will be playing in five competitions in the first two months of the year.
Between January and February they will be playing in LaLiga, the first rounds of the Copa del Rey (a title Madrid have not won since 2014), the Spanish Super Cup, where Los Blancos will defend the title, the Club World Cup (from 1 to 11 February) and the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 against Liverpool, in a tie that brings together the 2022 finalists.
Benzema is heading into the final six months of his contract with Los Blancos, although the club, player and his entourage know that an offer will be made to give him at least one more season at the Santiago Bernabéu.
