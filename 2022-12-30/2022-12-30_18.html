     Knicks superfan perfectly sums up fan frustrations with 12 words
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the most New York Knicks move ever, after winning eight games in a row, the team is now on a five-game losing streak.
New York had a prime opportunity to stop its losing skid on Thursday against the previous 11-23 Spurs, but instead, the Knicks suffered a 122-115 loss.
It’s now even more evident that if the Knicks don’t make changes, the organization will continue to be rooted in mediocrity.
Knicks fan and NBA Twitter personality Rob Perez went live to discuss his thoughts after the game and one comment in particular sums up what it’s like to be a New York Knicks fan.
Looking back at their losing skid, there isn’t a justifiable excuse for each loss.

     Knicks’ Julius Randle deflects All-Star talk: ‘Focused on the team’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HOUSTON — Julius Randle said he isn’t thinking about being named to the All-Star team for the second time in three seasons, after missing out last year.
Randle has averaged 27.9 points in 14 games in December, including 41 Thursday in the Knicks’ loss to the Spurs, their fifth defeat in a row.
“I’m just trying to focus on the team, helping us get wins, day by day, how I can improve as a player and a leader, and how we can improve as a team,” Randle said.
But I’m more focused on the team.”Still, Randle admitted his first career All-Star designation with the Knicks meant a lot to him in 2020.
“So it would be a great thing, but like I said, my focus is more on the team.”Julius Randle is not focused on his chances to make the All-Star team.

     Where Could Knicks Trade Derrick Rose?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: South Beach in January sounds like a much better place for a Rose to bloom than New York City.
That's what one anonymous NBA executive disclosed in a conversation with Sean Deveney of Heavy.com, hinting that the Miami Heat could contact the New York Knicks about the services of backup point guard Derrick Rose.
"They’re not confident that Kyle Lowry will be healthy in the playoffs, and they’ve had interest in Rose before."
Rose likely wouldn't push Miami's needle back toward full-on championship contention but the Heat would likely provide a better place for him to contribute.
Health is another issue: Rose hasn't played in more than 51 games in a single season since 2016-17, his first go with the Knicks.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Knicks broke into their apparent emergency roster stash on Thursday night.
Injuries to their headliners forced the Knicks to turn to a former starter, as Evan Fournier took to game day hardwood for the first time since Nov. 13.
Fournier was one of three double-figure scorers in a dire effort for the meandering Knicks (18-18).
Even with Rose and Fournier's personally triumphant returns, Cam Reddish remained parked for the 13th consecutive game.

     Summary: San Antonio is now 12-23 on the season, and winners of two out of their last three.
SAN ANTONIO — Julius Randle bullied San Antonio, but the Spurs never backed down.
Keldon Johnson scored 30 points and the Spurs overcame a season-high 41 from Randle to beat New York 122-115 on Thursday night, handing the Knicks their fifth straight loss.
“One of the key points to winning was just being physical because they are a really physical team,” San Antonio guard Romeo Langford said.
“A lot of guys, if they get two quick ones, they are out for the game no matter what,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said.

     Summary: The kind of boring win that the Spurs used to rack up in the regular season without even batting an eye.
With any luck, the Spurs might just be getting back to their old boring selves even sooner than we think.
I follow an inordinate number of Knicks fans on twitter for some reason, and they tweet about the stupid Knicks all the dang time.
I genuinely can’t tell and I refuse to watch a Knicks game unless the Spurs are playing them.

     Shorthanded Knicks show no depth in listless 122-115 loss to Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, they were facing an 11-23 Spurs team without its second-leading scorer, so it seemed like a convenient matchup to pull off a shorthanded loss.
The Knicks were often a step too slow to the ball, and the Spurs got too many open looks.
While some of the poor performance can be excused by the absence of Barrett and Quickley, depth is supposed to be the calling card of this Knicks team.
The other issue besides the Knicks’ sudden lack of depth was the choices that Thibodeau made with the rotation.
Instead, Thibodeau opted to bring in Evan Fournier, one of the Knicks’ worst defenders, and the Spurs immediately went on a 9-0 run.

     Summary: Dec 29, 2022; San Antonio, Texas, USA; New York Knicks forward Julius Randle (30) during the second half against the San Antonio Spurs at AT&amp;T Center.
Mandatory Credit: Scott Wachter-USA TODAY SportsThe New York Knicks are at Rock Bottom.
After winning eight straight games to start the month, New York has now lost five consecutive games, their longest losing streak of the season.
The losses they have suffered recently are making their win streak seem like a fluke.
During the win streak, RJ Barrett said that Randle was “going crazy” and that “he’s hooping.” It would appear that he is still doing just that.

     Spurs 122, Knicks 115: A practice in lethargy — The Strickland: A New York Knicks Site Guaranteed To Make 'Em Jump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was as if the Knicks expected the Spurs, playing without Devin Vassell, to roll over and let them have this victory.
The Spurs, a woeful offense, decided, as many have recently, that the Knicks would be the opponent they couldn’t miss against.
The Spurs got pretty much wherever they wanted on the court using an abundance of off-ball movement and paint penetration.
Following a 15-assist, one-turnover game, Quickley backed that up with seven more assists to just one turnover.
Quickley’s advanced turnover rate provides more possessions for a Knicks offense that can grow stagnant in the half court.

     Summary: The Knicks are 11th overall in defensive rating on the season, according to NBA.com.
“We’ve got to get back to our defensive ways,” said Knicks forward Julius Randle, who had 41 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists in the loss to the Spurs.
“Defensively we’re not where we’ve got to be to win games,” Knicks guard Immanuel Quickley said.
The Rockets, who lead the NBA in offensive rebounding percentage at 34.5 percent, have been vulnerable in transition because of their relentless pounding of the offensive glass.
“We are an offensive rebounding team that goes after the offensive glass,” Rockets coach Stephen Silas said.
