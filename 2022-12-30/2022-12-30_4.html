     Summary: LIVERPOOL VS LEICESTER CITY| Saturday, December 30th |Premier League | Anfield8:00PM BST/3:00PM ESTThe games in recent times against Leicester have been feisty ones, regardless of the venue or competition — a key example would have been the 3-3 in the cup last season, which saw a late Taki Minamino equalizer become a progression via penalties.
The atmosphere for that match was unexpectedly feral for a domestic cup, and likely directly related to the topic of the songs by the visitors.
Expect more of that today, particularly given the late timeslot.
Both teams have been facing struggles in form and fitness, with both teams arguing themselves the worse off.
Suffice it to say that both will be desperate for a result.
