     This Is The Reason Trump Hid His Tax Returns For So Long
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty ImagesI t is not a big mystery why Donald Trump refused to release his tax returns.
I wouldn’t do it.”Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s former attorney, gave a similar explanation when asked about Trump’s returns during a 2019 congressional hearing.
The former president’s tax information had never been public until Friday—and some of it still remains shielded after the House Ways and Means Committee released years of paperwork.
The federal tax authority has audited Trump’s tax returns many times over the years.
During Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, his personal tax returns remained hidden.

     Trump’s tax returns released, launching fresh scrutiny of his finances
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He paid roughly $1 million in taxes in 2018, but nothing in 2020 after reporting negative income of $4.8 million.
In his last year as president, Trump reported making no charitable contributions, despite a promise he made while campaigning to give away his annual presidential salary of $400,000.
Democrats say their investigation of Trump’s taxes and a mandatory presidential audit program will transform accountability for the most powerful person in the country.
Despite the release of the returns, significant questions may still go unanswered, Steve Rosenthal of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said.
“The ‘Trump’ tax returns once again show how proudly successful I have been and how I have been able to use depreciation and various other tax deductions as an incentive for creating thousands of jobs and magnificent structures and enterprises,” he said in his email.

     Trump’s tax returns released after long fight with Congress
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Democrats in Congress released thousands of pages of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns Friday, providing the most detailed picture to date of his finances over a six-year period, including his time in the White House, when he fought to keep the information private in a break with decades of precedent.
The documents include individual returns from Trump and his wife, Melania, along with Trump’s business entities from 2015-2020.
In 2020, the year the coronavirus ravaged the economy, Trump reported no charitable donations at all.
The returns detail how Trump used tax law to minimize his liability, including carrying forward massive losses from previous years, as allowed by tax law.
The IRS only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings on April 3, 2019 — more than two years into his presidency — when the Ways and Means chairman, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., asked the agency for information related to the tax returns.

     What have we learned from former President Trump's tax returns?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "MEET THE PRESS")CHUCK TODD: Will you release any of your tax returns for the public to scrutinize?
ROSENTHAL: Well, President Trump paid few taxes.
Presidents in the past have routinely released their tax returns voluntarily in the spirit of transparency.
We've never had an issue with IRS mandatory audits of presidents to our knowledge before, and President Biden's tax returns have been audited appropriately.
What's really curious - and we don't know the answer - is that because of the sophistication and complication of Trump's taxes, is it because of Trump's obstruction and delay?

     Donald Trump: Key takeaways from six years of former president's tax returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The release of the tax returns follows a pursuit for the documents that had typically been made public voluntarily by past US presidents.
Trump and his legal team continuously sought to keep his returns secret, arguing that Congress had never wielded its legislative powers to demand a president’s tax returns, which Trump said could have far-reaching implications.
Biden’s income tax returns and financial disclosures showed no business dealings or income from China.
The 2017 tax law capped the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, at $10,000 a year.
Their report focused primarily on whether Trump’s tax returns during his time in office were properly audited under the IRS’ mandatory audit program for US presidents.
