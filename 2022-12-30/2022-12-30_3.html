     Summary: Tennessee football faces off against the Clemson Tigers in the Orange Bowl game on Friday.
Clemson, on the other hand, is coming off an upset loss to South Carolina in the final game of the regular season.
Scott Keepfer, Clemson football beat reporterClemson 28, Tennessee 27: Without some of its key offensive threats, does Tennessee still have enough firepower to put up a lot of points on Clemson’s defense?
Jim Rice, sports editorClemson 30, Tennessee 21: Tennessee is without quarterback Hendon Hooker and receivers Cedric Tillman and Jalin Hyatt.
Mounting a running game as Tennessee did against Vanderbilt and repeatedly pressuring Clemson’s freshman quarterback would further enhance its chances for victory.

     Tennessee 14 Clemson 3: Halftime Analysis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clemson's defense has played well enough, holding the prolific Tennessee offense to just 14 first-half points, forcing the Volunteers to go three and out on three different occasions in the half.
The Tigers offense has moved it as well, outgaining Tennessee in the opening half, but it's an unsuccessful fake FG attempt along with three B.t.
Halftime AnalysisFive different times the Tigers were in a position to score points in the first half, yet came away with nothing, as Clemson crossed the 50-yard line on every first-half possession.
Clemson went for a fake FG on 4th and 4 from the 27 on its opening possession.
Clemson has outgained the Vols totaling 273 yards, while Tennessee has 191.
