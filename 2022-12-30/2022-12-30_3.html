    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: South Carolina vs. Notre Dame is one of the highest-profile bowls that is not a New Year's Six Game.
Our staff at Gamecocks Digest sees a competitive football game that comes down to the fourth quarter.
With both squads executing well lately, we should be in for an excellent football game.
Evan Crowell: South Carolina 28, Notre Dame 24These two programs are evenly matched, in my opinion.
Andrew Lyon: South Carolina 27, Notre Dame 24This game will live up to every bit of the hype it possesses coming into today.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: South Carolina football is facing off against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the 2022 Taxslayer Gator Bowl on Friday.
A South Carolina win would put the Gamecocks in a comfortable position to enter the offseason and continue boasting recruitment.
Notre Dame hasn’t escaped unscathed – its quarterback transferred and top receiver and pass rusher opted out – but the Irish have a deeper roster.
Blake Toppmeyer, SEC columnistSouth Carolina 28, Notre Dame 21: Notre Dame is favored in this game despite being without starting quarterback Drew Pyne.
Still, expect a good Spencer Rattler game.
