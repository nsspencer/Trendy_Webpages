     Summary: [1/2] Television personality Barbara Walters arrives for the premiere of the film "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" in New York September 20, 2010.
"I asked Yeltsin if he drank too much, and I asked Putin if he killed anybody," Walters told the New York Times in 2013.
"These two men were really quite brutal to me and it was not pleasant," Walters told the San Francisco Examiner.
The New York Times called her "arguably America's best-known television personality" but also observed that "what we remember most about a Barbara Walters interview is Barbara Walters."
Walters' three marriages - to businessman Robert Katz, theatrical producer Lee Guber and television executive Merv Adelson - ended in divorce.
