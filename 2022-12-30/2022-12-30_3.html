     Spurs Win Despite Huge Games From Knicks' Julius Randle, Immanuel Quickley
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Antonio Spurs (12-23) defeated the New York Knicks (18-18) during the NBA Thursday slate, with 122-115 being the final score.
The Knicks struggled to stay competitive in this game despite receiving a staggering 41 points, 11 rebounds, and seven assists from Julius Randle.
Perhaps what makes it all the more impressive: Immanuel Quickley added 36 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists.
San Antonio holds the belief that defensive execution was what got them the win.
"I feel like we did a great job at executing and we stayed solid on defense for the most part.

     Summary: Dec 29, 2022; San Antonio, Texas, USA; New York Knicks forward Julius Randle (30) during the second half against the San Antonio Spurs at AT&amp;T Center.
Mandatory Credit: Scott Wachter-USA TODAY SportsThe New York Knicks are at Rock Bottom.
After winning eight straight games to start the month, New York has now lost five consecutive games, their longest losing streak of the season.
The losses they have suffered recently are making their win streak seem like a fluke.
During the win streak, RJ Barrett said that Randle was “going crazy” and that “he’s hooping.” It would appear that he is still doing just that.

     Johnson powers Spurs to 122-115 victory over slumping Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Antonio is now 12-23 on the season, and winners of two out of their last three.
SAN ANTONIO — Julius Randle bullied San Antonio, but the Spurs never backed down.
Keldon Johnson scored 30 points and the Spurs overcame a season-high 41 from Randle to beat New York 122-115 on Thursday night, handing the Knicks their fifth straight loss.
“One of the key points to winning was just being physical because they are a really physical team,” San Antonio guard Romeo Langford said.
“A lot of guys, if they get two quick ones, they are out for the game no matter what,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said.

     Shorthanded Knicks show no depth in listless 122-115 loss to Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, they were facing an 11-23 Spurs team without its second-leading scorer, so it seemed like a convenient matchup to pull off a shorthanded loss.
The Knicks were often a step too slow to the ball, and the Spurs got too many open looks.
While some of the poor performance can be excused by the absence of Barrett and Quickley, depth is supposed to be the calling card of this Knicks team.
The other issue besides the Knicks’ sudden lack of depth was the choices that Thibodeau made with the rotation.
Instead, Thibodeau opted to bring in Evan Fournier, one of the Knicks’ worst defenders, and the Spurs immediately went on a 9-0 run.
