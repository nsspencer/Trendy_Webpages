     Summary: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- The TCU football players have been studying the Michigan football team for weeks.
But how much do they know about the state of Michigan?
On Thursday, they were asked a handful of questions about the Mitten State.
It’s understandable given that most of the players on the Texas Christian University roster are from Texas.
And remember, the questions and answers were all in good fun in advance of Saturday’s Fiesta Bowl matchup between TCU and Michigan (4:10 p.m.

     Michigan Football: 3 Fiesta Bowl X-Factors Crucial to the Wolverines’ Success
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Fiesta Bowl is one day away, where Michigan football and TCU will be squaring off for the opportunity to play in the National Championship.
Michigan football has plenty of players who are capable of impacting the game in a big way.
With TCU allegedly dead-set on stopping the run, the tight ends are going to have to play a big role.
Between run blocking and catching passes, he and senior Luke Schoonmaker are going to be called on all game.
Loveland is more unknown, and if we get his best, it will go a long way for the Wolverines.

     Michigan football reveals uniform combination for College Football Playoff game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: — The Michigan football team will wear blue jerseys with maize pants, maize socks, maize accessories and blue gloves for the College Football Playoff game against TCU, the program revealed Friday night.
The Nike Jumpman logo, a normal feature on U-M football jerseys, will be stylized in a reflective silver for the game.
The maize-and-blue combination is the traditional home look for the Wolverines, though accessories are more often white rather than maize or blue.
Hardly anybody gets this kind of opportunity and it's the best of the best playing the best.
And I include -- had some great Little League teams that I was on, high school team, college teams, pro teams.

     Michigan football reveals Vrbo Fiesta Bowl uniform combination
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After nearly a month of waiting, Michigan football is finally about to embark upon its College Football Playoff journey, with the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl set to kick off on Saturday.
While the onus of fan thoughts are on how the team will play vs. TCU, another often wondered about topic is which uniform will the Wolverines wear?
Though the idea was that the maize and blue would wear the all-blue uniforms that they wear in bigger games, the Wolverines are actually going traditional, with blue jerseys, maize pants but also adding maize accessories.
Michigan football is designated as the home team as the 2-seed, with TCU being the 3-seed.
The game will kick off at 2 p.m. MT in Glendale, Arizona.

     Summary: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — The love and admiration came right away, mere moments after the Michigan football team landed at nearby Sky Harbor International Airport on Monday.
“People go a lifetime without the opportunity like our team has,” Harbaugh said this week.
“This isn’t just a football team where we come from different places and just try to win football games together.
On paper, Michigan, who will enter Saturday’s game (4 p.m., ESPN) as a touchdown-plus favorite, should win this game.
A win would place Harbaugh and his Wolverines on college football’s highest stage.
