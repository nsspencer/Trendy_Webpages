    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reflections on what we are leaving behind in 2022 and what possibilities that lie ahead for 2023 may leave us feeling melancholy, maybe even depressed.
The classic song “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” made famous by Judy Garland in the film “Meet Me in St. Louis,” offers a great deal of perspective on just this sentiment.
In the film, Garland’s character, Esther, is consoling her little sister Tootie, on moving ahead with their lives in a new city and leaving St. Louis behind.
According to classicfm.com, originally the lyrics were not so brightly tied to good cheer: “Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
It was then changed to “Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
