     Summary: How many legionnaires got their first info on the Legion here and then proudly completed their five years?
So, it’s all together twelve articles (many of them with a French version) for twelve months.
Besides, I would like to expand the PHOTOS and DOCUMENTS series to include, for example, old Foreign Legion unit stamps.
