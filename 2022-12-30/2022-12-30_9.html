     Michigan Football: 3 Fiesta Bowl X-Factors Crucial to the Wolverines’ Success
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Fiesta Bowl is one day away, where Michigan football and TCU will be squaring off for the opportunity to play in the National Championship.
Michigan football has plenty of players who are capable of impacting the game in a big way.
With TCU allegedly dead-set on stopping the run, the tight ends are going to have to play a big role.
Between run blocking and catching passes, he and senior Luke Schoonmaker are going to be called on all game.
Loveland is more unknown, and if we get his best, it will go a long way for the Wolverines.

     Summary: — The Michigan football team will wear blue jerseys with maize pants, maize socks, maize accessories and blue gloves for the College Football Playoff game against TCU, the program revealed Friday night.
The Nike Jumpman logo, a normal feature on U-M football jerseys, will be stylized in a reflective silver for the game.
The maize-and-blue combination is the traditional home look for the Wolverines, though accessories are more often white rather than maize or blue.
Hardly anybody gets this kind of opportunity and it's the best of the best playing the best.
And I include -- had some great Little League teams that I was on, high school team, college teams, pro teams.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. — The biggest test for Michigan football on Saturday when it takes on TCU in the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl will likely be TCU’s vaunted passing offense against the Wolverines secondary.
There’s no team in college football that has as many explosive plays — especially for touchdown — than TCU.
On Thursday, we spoke with Michigan safeties coach Jay Harbaugh about what he’s expecting from the Horned Frog passing attack, and he broke down why they’re such a daunting challenge.
There’s gonna be times when they get the ball in space.
There’s gonna be a group effort if we’re going to have success.”Even so, Michigan’s defense has been solid all year long, no matter the opponent.

     Michigan football reveals Vrbo Fiesta Bowl uniform combination
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After nearly a month of waiting, Michigan football is finally about to embark upon its College Football Playoff journey, with the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl set to kick off on Saturday.
While the onus of fan thoughts are on how the team will play vs. TCU, another often wondered about topic is which uniform will the Wolverines wear?
Though the idea was that the maize and blue would wear the all-blue uniforms that they wear in bigger games, the Wolverines are actually going traditional, with blue jerseys, maize pants but also adding maize accessories.
Michigan football is designated as the home team as the 2-seed, with TCU being the 3-seed.
