     What Steven Tyler Has Said About Abuse Accuser Julia Holcomb
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aerosmith front man Steven Tyler has been accused of sexual misconduct with a minor for alleged crimes dating back to the 1970s.
Julia Holcomb filed papers in a Los Angeles court accusing him of sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
Holcomb is able to sue Tyler, 74, after California temporarily waived statutes of limitations for childhood sexual abuse allegations.
"She was sixteen, she knew how to nasty, and there wasn't a hair on it," Tyler wrote in his memoir.
"Well—Julia Holcomb is always nearby, trailing in her wistfully towering way off his arm like a scarf—but Steven Tyler is wedded to his career and image 24 hours a day."

     Aerosmith's Steven Tyler accused of sexual assault of a minor in a new lawsuit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A woman alleges Aerosmith's Steven Tyler sexually assaulted her when she was a minor in the 1970s.
Julie Holcomb said she was 16 when she met Tyler, and he "performed various acts of criminal sexual conduct upon" her.
But Rolling Stone reported that the documents contained details that obviously referred to Tyler — including direct quotes from Tyler's 1997 memoir.
Holcomb reportedly said in her lawsuit that she met Tyler shortly after she turned 16, when she attended an Aerosmith concert in Portland, Oregon.
Holcomb's lawsuit alleged that Tyler committed sexual assault, sexual battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress during this time.

     Aerosmith Singer Steven Tyler Accused Of Sexually Assaulting A Minor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tyler's memoir made a cryptic reference to his time spent with an underage girl, but he maintained they had a "romantic, loving relationship."
According to the docs obtained by Rolling Stone, Holcomb first met Tyler just after her 16th birthday at a 1973 Aerosmith concert in Portland, Oregon.
The docs also state Tyler tried to coax Holcomb's mom into turning over guardianship of her daughter to him so he could fully provide for her.
After that, she reportedly left Tyler and went back home to Portland to pick up the pieces of her life.
Holcomb's suit accuses Tyler of sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

     Steven Tyler Accused of Sexual Assault of a Minor in New Lawsuit Over a Decades-Old Claim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the Seattle show, Tyler allegedly performed more sexual acts on her, and Holcomb flew back to Portland the next morning.
Tyler allegedly told Holcomb’s mother he would provide better support than she was getting at home, promising to enroll her in school and give her medical care.
According to the lawsuit, Holcomb was hesitant about going through with the abortion, but Tyler had threatened to stop supporting her if she didn’t proceed with the procedure.
In the suit, Holcomb says she’s mentioned in the memoir’s acknowledgments which further removed her anonymity.
Since taking effect last month, two women have accused the late record executive Ahmet Ertegun of sexual assault in the 1980s and 1990s.
