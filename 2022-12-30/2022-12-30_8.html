    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clemson vs Tennessee OddsWhen Florida and Syracuse met in 1999, it may have been the color scheme mixture that most closely resembled the Orange Bowl.
Fast forward more than 20 years later, and HEX codes #FF8200 and #F56600 will represent the orangest game in history thanks to Tennessee and Clemson, respectively.
Clemson will be without the services of wide receiver Beaux Collins and running back Kobe Pace heading into the Orange Bowl.
The Volunteers offense will be without key contributors in Biletnikoff Award winner Jalin Hyatt and receiver Cedric Tillman.
The Tennessee defense did not have nearly as many losses due to the transfer portal or opt-outs, but inefficiency in general played a role all season.
