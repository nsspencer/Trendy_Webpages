The second half was particularly rough for the South Carolina run defense, which gave up 211 of 264 the Irish's rushing yards after halftime.
Coaching: CShane Beamer was secretive about who would call plays for South Carolina following Marcus Satterfield's departure for Nebraska, and it seemed to pay off.
Overall: B-After ending the regular season on a high, the Gator Bowl wasn't the triumphant finale that South Carolina hoped for.

     Fighting Irish 4-1-1 - South Carolina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saturday afternoon’s Gator Bowl matinee featuring a pair of resurgent programs, Notre Dame and South Carolina, most closely resembled the Fighting Irish’s debut campaign under first-year coach Marcus Freeman.
The Fighting Irish, despite quarterback Tyler Buchner making just his third career start and first in 16 weeks, were the more poised group – if not quite always the sharpest.
In the second half, everything changed up front for the Fighting Irish.
9, 9: Notre Dame notched nine tackles for losses against South Carolina and added an additional nine quarterback hurries.
But Freeman’s “For The Brotherhood” culture, timely dynamics from individuals, and collective work in all three elements lifted Notre Dame to victory.

     Summary: FIRST HALF*** Notre Dame's run game struggled to get much going early against a South Carolina defense that was clearly prepared for Duo.
South Carolina knew Notre Dame didn't attack this area during the regular season so they weren't ready for it.
SECOND HALF*** Notre Dame was a different animal in the second half.
*** Notre Dame followed that up with another great drive, mixing up the run game and quick perimeter pass game to put another scoring drive together.
