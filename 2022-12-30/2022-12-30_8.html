     Summary: But heâ€™s still a damn great player even as Father Time attempts to take him down with every passing moment.
Surely enough, some of the most prominent personalities in the NBA, aside from Kevin Durant, marveled at such a ridiculous performance from someone in his 20th season in the NBA.
â€” Pau Gasol (@paugasol) December 31, 2022In addition, Big Game James Worthy just expressed into words (and actions) everything everyone has been thinking about LeBron James following his dominant performance.
Carry onâ€¦ â€” Kendrick Perkins (@KendrickPerkins) December 31, 2022With LeBron James in the twilight of his career, they know better than to take for this 47/10/9 performance for granted.
(The answer is probably many more, given how difficult James has made it to doubt him.)

The scoring tally trails only the birthday 48 James put on the Hawks in 2009, when he turned 25.

     Summary: LeBron James celebrated his 38th birthday with 47 points and a near triple-double in the Lakersâ€™ 130-121 win over the Hawks on Friday night.

James went 1 of 5 out of the gates, totaling just two points in the first quarter.
After the game, James said in his postgame interview that he told his teammates he was going to put up 40 points.
According to ESPN, James' night gives him career 303 points scored on his birthday, surpassing Oscar Robertson who's now second all time with 275.
