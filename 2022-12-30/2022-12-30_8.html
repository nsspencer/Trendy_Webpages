     Summary: Tennessee football faces off against the Clemson Tigers in the Orange Bowl game on Friday.
Clemson, on the other hand, is coming off an upset loss to South Carolina in the final game of the regular season.
Scott Keepfer, Clemson football beat reporterClemson 28, Tennessee 27: Without some of its key offensive threats, does Tennessee still have enough firepower to put up a lot of points on Clemson’s defense?
Jim Rice, sports editorClemson 30, Tennessee 21: Tennessee is without quarterback Hendon Hooker and receivers Cedric Tillman and Jalin Hyatt.
Mounting a running game as Tennessee did against Vanderbilt and repeatedly pressuring Clemson’s freshman quarterback would further enhance its chances for victory.
