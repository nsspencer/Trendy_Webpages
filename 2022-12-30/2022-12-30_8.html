     House Democrats release Trump's tax returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Updated December 30, 2022 at 11:47 AM ETFormer President Donald Trump's tax returns from 2015 through 2020 have been made public by the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee — concluding a years-long political battle by Democrats to obtain and share the documents.
The committee released the tax returns Friday morning on its website and provided no new additional information or statements.
Present on each year of Trump's tax returns was additional income in the form of related-party loans to several of Trump's children, totaling approximately $51,000 annually from 2015 to 2019 and $46,000 in 2020.
This fall, Trump continued his attempts to halt the release of the information, requesting the Supreme Court bar the Ways and Means Committee from making the tax returns public.
We think Democrats will come to regret this, and I think they may regret it sooner than they think."

     Trump’s tax returns to be released Friday after long fight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DECEMBER 30, 2022, UPDATE:UNDATED (AP)- Democrats in Congress have released thousands of pages of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns.
The documents include individual returns from Trump and his wife, Melania, along with Trump’s business entities from 2015-2020.
The returns show how Trump used tax law to minimize his liability.
The IRS only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings on April 3, 2019 — more than two years into his presidency — when the Ways and Means chairman, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., asked the agency for information related to the tax returns.
The Joint Committee on Taxation report raised multiple red flags about aspects of Trump’s tax filings, including his carryover losses, deductions tied to conservation and charitable donations, and loans to his children that could be taxable gifts.

     Donald Trump: Key takeaways from six years of former president's tax returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The release of the tax returns follows a pursuit for the documents that had typically been made public voluntarily by past US presidents.
Trump and his legal team continuously sought to keep his returns secret, arguing that Congress had never wielded its legislative powers to demand a president’s tax returns, which Trump said could have far-reaching implications.
Biden’s income tax returns and financial disclosures showed no business dealings or income from China.
The 2017 tax law capped the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, at $10,000 a year.
Their report focused primarily on whether Trump’s tax returns during his time in office were properly audited under the IRS’ mandatory audit program for US presidents.
