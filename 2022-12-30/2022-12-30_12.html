     South Carolina football falls to Notre Dame 45-38 in disappointing Gator Bowl finish
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — South Carolina football lost 45-38 to Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl on Friday in disappointing fashion after a last-minute unsportsmanlike conduct penalty cost them before the final play.
With 30 seconds on the clock, South Carolina was in a third-and-long situation following an intentional grounding call on quarterback Spencer Rattler.
South Carolina and Notre Dame had not met since 1984, and the Irish now lead 4-1 in the all-time series.
Fortune's interception tied things again, but it ultimately wasn't enough to hold off a charging Notre Dame offense.
Offense struggles to keep momentumThe expectations were high for Rattler and the South Carolina offense coming off of regular-season upsets over Tennessee and Clemson.

     Marcus Freeman recaps Notre Dame's incredible Gator Bowl win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Notre Dame football started the 2022 calendar year by getting a commitment from safety Peyton Bowen in the 2023 class.
A few hours later the Irish jumped out to a 28-7 first half lead over Oklahoma State in the Fiesta Bowl.
And mega-recruit Peyton Bowen’s recruitment which ultimately wound up with him signing at Oklahoma won’t soon be forgotten by anyone.
363 days later it’s safe to say Marcus Freeman has experienced quite a bit after leading the Irish as their head coach.
After Notre Dame’s incredibly entertaining 45-38 victory over South Carolina in the Gator Bowl, Freeman met the media to recap the game and season.

     Fighting Irish 4-1-1 - South Carolina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saturday afternoon’s Gator Bowl matinee featuring a pair of resurgent programs, Notre Dame and South Carolina, most closely resembled the Fighting Irish’s debut campaign under first-year coach Marcus Freeman.
The Fighting Irish, despite quarterback Tyler Buchner making just his third career start and first in 16 weeks, were the more poised group – if not quite always the sharpest.
In the second half, everything changed up front for the Fighting Irish.
9, 9: Notre Dame notched nine tackles for losses against South Carolina and added an additional nine quarterback hurries.
But Freeman’s “For The Brotherhood” culture, timely dynamics from individuals, and collective work in all three elements lifted Notre Dame to victory.

     Summary: FIRST HALF*** Notre Dame's run game struggled to get much going early against a South Carolina defense that was clearly prepared for Duo.
South Carolina knew Notre Dame didn't attack this area during the regular season so they weren't ready for it.
SECOND HALF*** Notre Dame was a different animal in the second half.
*** Notre Dame followed that up with another great drive, mixing up the run game and quick perimeter pass game to put another scoring drive together.
