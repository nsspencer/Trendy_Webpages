     Gary Payton II given Warriors NBA championship ring by Draymond Green
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With his Basketball Hall of Famer father watching from a courtside seat, Gary Payton II received his 2021-22 NBA championship ring in a ceremony before the Warriors' Friday night game against the Portland Trail Blazers.
GP2 picked up his ring from former Golden State teammate Draymond Green just before tip-off between the Western Conference rivals at Chase Center.
Before the game, Warriors coach Steve Kerr was asked about what it will be like to watch Payton, a favorite among his former teammates and Dub Nation, receive his first championship ring.
"So, thrilled to see Gary tonight, and we kept in touch a little bit.
Green understands and appreciated the path Payton took to reach this moment, so he was excited to be the one to hand him the jewelry.

     Warriors On Pace to Set Unexpected NBA Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Sport Radar, the Golden State Warriors are on pace for the most lopsided home and away record split since the NBA-ABA merger.
It's actually surreal to see those stats on paper when you look at the Warriors' record at home and on the road.
At home, the Warriors are 15-2; they're the best team in the NBA at home and have the best record.
On the road, the Warriors are 3-16; they're the worst team in the NBA on the road and have the worst record.
These numbers aren't just a Steph Curry was playing in some games and he wasn't in others either.

     WATCH: Gary Payton II Receives his Warriors Championship Ring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It feels like his time with the team was ages ago, but Gary Payton II finally received his championship ring with the Golden State Warriors.
The Warriors are currently facing off against the Blazers at home, and the team had a small little ceremony for Payton to receive his ring.
“It’ll be a great moment," Kerr said.
The team started horribly defensively and it took some time for it to catch up, but they've finally started figuring it out.
Even though Gary Payton II is no longer on the Warriors, today is a great moment for him that fans of the franchise should celebrate.

     Warriors' four-game winning streak not always pretty but it's progress
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors have their first four-game win streak of the season, and they are back above .500 for the first time in three weeks.
Golden State’s 118-112 victory Friday night at Chase Center was equal parts resilience and tomfoolery.
Told that the Warriors have their first four-game win streak of the season, Draymond clearly was pleased.
The Warriors are 4-0 at the halfway point of their longest homestand of the season.
But considering the circumstances, winning four straight games while two All-Stars watch from bench is a lot of goodness of which the Warriors can build.

DiVincenzo took a whack at it and hit all ball, dislodging it for the steal of the night.
Poole and Thompson combine for 72 pointsThe Warriors rested Thompson in their previous game.

     Summary: Warriors still miss GP2 after discovering his true NBA value originally appeared on NBC Sports BayareaThe NBA season is in its 11th week and Gary Payton II, who left the Warriors to sign the Portland Trail Blazers, has yet to make his debut.
The Warriors want Payton to get healthy, to be sure, but they’re OK if he won’t be available to harass every offensive player in his space on Friday.
And it's not something we really could entertain doing.”By not re-signing GP2 and Porter, the Warriors saved roughly $60 million in luxury taxes.
Declining to re-sign GP2 also was a nudge toward getting more playing time for the young players in whom the franchise had invested through the draft.
“That’s a road that probably involved 10 G League teams, eight or nine NBA teams.
