     Summary: South Carolina football is facing off against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the 2022 Taxslayer Gator Bowl on Friday.
A South Carolina win would put the Gamecocks in a comfortable position to enter the offseason and continue boasting recruitment.
Notre Dame hasn’t escaped unscathed – its quarterback transferred and top receiver and pass rusher opted out – but the Irish have a deeper roster.
Blake Toppmeyer, SEC columnistSouth Carolina 28, Notre Dame 21: Notre Dame is favored in this game despite being without starting quarterback Drew Pyne.
Still, expect a good Spencer Rattler game.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FIRST HALF*** Notre Dame's run game struggled to get much going early against a South Carolina defense that was clearly prepared for Duo.
South Carolina knew Notre Dame didn't attack this area during the regular season so they weren't ready for it.
SECOND HALF*** Notre Dame was a different animal in the second half.
*** Notre Dame followed that up with another great drive, mixing up the run game and quick perimeter pass game to put another scoring drive together.
