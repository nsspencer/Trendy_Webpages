     Warriors On Pace to Set Unexpected NBA Record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Sport Radar, the Golden State Warriors are on pace for the most lopsided home and away record split since the NBA-ABA merger.
It's actually surreal to see those stats on paper when you look at the Warriors' record at home and on the road.
At home, the Warriors are 15-2; they're the best team in the NBA at home and have the best record.
On the road, the Warriors are 3-16; they're the worst team in the NBA on the road and have the worst record.
These numbers aren't just a Steph Curry was playing in some games and he wasn't in others either.

     Summary: Warriors still miss GP2 after discovering his true NBA value originally appeared on NBC Sports BayareaThe NBA season is in its 11th week and Gary Payton II, who left the Warriors to sign the Portland Trail Blazers, has yet to make his debut.

And it's not something we really could entertain doing.”By not re-signing GP2 and Porter, the Warriors saved roughly $60 million in luxury taxes.
Declining to re-sign GP2 also was a nudge toward getting more playing time for the young players in whom the franchise had invested through the draft.
“That’s a road that probably involved 10 G League teams, eight or nine NBA teams.
