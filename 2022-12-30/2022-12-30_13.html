     Clemson football cornerback Sheridan Jones to miss Orange Bowl vs. Tennessee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. – Clemson senior cornerback Sheridan Jones will miss Friday night’s Orange Bowl game against Tennessee.
Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said Thursday that he didn’t expect Jones to play after he suffered a hip flexor.
A 6-foot, 190-pounder from Norfolk, Virginia, Jones played in 10 games this season, all starts.
He had 31 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss, a quarterback hurry and broke up a pass.
“As far as if he’s done at Clemson, he’s declared this as his senior year,” Swinney said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (FOX Carolina) - For Clemson fans, when you pack to go to an away game there are some essentials you probably bring such as your Clemson attire and $2 bills.
45 years later, the tradition of bringing and spending $2 bills at Clemson away games is still going strong.
And so it’s a great tradition and a lot of people participate in it,” said George Duncan.
Duncan is in Miami from Gaffney for the Orange Bowl and can’t make road trips for Clemson football games without $2 bills.
Spread out through cities around America, the $2 bill stamped at home or the bank with a Tiger Paw is a point of pride for Clemson fans.

     Summary: Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-- The Orange Bowl is set to take place in just a couple of hours as No.6 Tennessee and No.7 Clemson will square off inside of Hard Rock Stadium.
Outside of that, Tennessee can stamp a season that exceeded all expectations and predictions with a victory over a perennial power in Clemson.
Tennessee needs to have another decent game running to really fuel this offense that will also be without Hyatt and Tillman out wide.
Clemson will have pieces to arrange, but the big key for Clemson is Cade Klubnik.
For Joe Milton, the running game is essential for both his confidence and comfort level.
