     Alabama football vs. Kansas State: Score prediction, scouting report for Sugar Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW ORLEANS ― Opt outs haven't bled into the Sugar Bowl, and that should make for a relatively compelling game between Alabama football and Kansas State.
Kansas State has won its past four games (Baylor, West Virginia, Kansas and TCU).
"Here's our scouting report and score prediction for Alabama's matchup against Kansas State.
Klein said Kansas State would love to get Martinez on the field now that he is healthy.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama and Kansas State have zero shared history.
They do, however, share a notable footnote in college football history -- one Kansas State would much rather forget.
Newly-top-ranked Kansas State went to 4-5 Baylor only to take a stunning 52-24 beating.
That Kansas State loss paired with No.
Over in Kansas City, a then-11-year-old Cooper Beebe was a big Kansas State fan.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sadly enough Alabama’s 2022 football season will come to an end on Saturday afternoon at the conclusion of the Allstate Sugar Bowl.
Although the season has been a slight disappointment, Nick Saban and the Crimson Tide can right the ship and end the year on a high note with a victory over the Big 12 champs, the Kansas State Wildcats.
Alabama will be challenged on both sides of the ball by a Kansas State team that plays an old-school, physical style of football which was enough to beat the playoff-bound TCU Horned Frogs.
Here are five bold predictions for the Allstate Sugar Bowl matchup between the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Kansas State Wildcats.

     Summary: HISTORYAlabama football has had a love/hate relationship with the Sugar Bowl.
January 2, 1978 #3 Alabama 35 #9 Ohio State 6 Controversial #2 ranking.
I fear that it will be a poor fan turnout for the crimson and white this year.
Kansas State is a tough pesky team that has the motivation that most Tide opponents have and that is to knock off the “Kings of College Football”.

     Alabama vs. Kansas State: 5 final thoughts and a prediction on the Sugar Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is somewhat humorous for anyone old enough to even think about the words “consolation prize” and “Sugar Bowl” in the same sentence.
So yes, the Sugar Bowl was once hardly a consolation destination.
Those prized recruits are seeing what Alabama football offers, even at the end of a “down” year.
With that, here are 5 final thoughts on Alabama’s Sugar Bowl showdown with No.
With opt-outs not tearing down this Sugar Bowl like some other bowl games, everyone is all in, and that means these defenses aren’t decimated like they easily could have been.
