    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dec 29, 2022; San Antonio, Texas, USA; New York Knicks forward Julius Randle (30) during the second half against the San Antonio Spurs at AT&amp;T Center.
Mandatory Credit: Scott Wachter-USA TODAY SportsThe New York Knicks are at Rock Bottom.
After winning eight straight games to start the month, New York has now lost five consecutive games, their longest losing streak of the season.
The losses they have suffered recently are making their win streak seem like a fluke.
During the win streak, RJ Barrett said that Randle was “going crazy” and that “he’s hooping.” It would appear that he is still doing just that.

     Shorthanded Knicks show no depth in listless 122-115 loss to Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, they were facing an 11-23 Spurs team without its second-leading scorer, so it seemed like a convenient matchup to pull off a shorthanded loss.
The Knicks were often a step too slow to the ball, and the Spurs got too many open looks.
While some of the poor performance can be excused by the absence of Barrett and Quickley, depth is supposed to be the calling card of this Knicks team.
The other issue besides the Knicks’ sudden lack of depth was the choices that Thibodeau made with the rotation.
Instead, Thibodeau opted to bring in Evan Fournier, one of the Knicks’ worst defenders, and the Spurs immediately went on a 9-0 run.

     Summary: San Antonio is now 12-23 on the season, and winners of two out of their last three.
SAN ANTONIO — Julius Randle bullied San Antonio, but the Spurs never backed down.
Keldon Johnson scored 30 points and the Spurs overcame a season-high 41 from Randle to beat New York 122-115 on Thursday night, handing the Knicks their fifth straight loss.
“One of the key points to winning was just being physical because they are a really physical team,” San Antonio guard Romeo Langford said.
“A lot of guys, if they get two quick ones, they are out for the game no matter what,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said.
