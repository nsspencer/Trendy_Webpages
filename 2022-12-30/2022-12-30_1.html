     Idaho murders: 28-year-old man arrested in Pennsylvania
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 28-year-old man, Bryan Kohberger, was arrested Friday morning in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains in connection with the murders of four University of Idaho students, according to a criminal complaint.
A photo posted by Kaylee Goncalves a few days before their deaths shows University of Idaho students Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves.
"We just want this person found so bad," Kristi Goncalves, mom of victim Kaylee Goncalves, told ABC News earlier this month.
Moscow Police monitor the residence where four University of Idaho students were killed in Moscow, Idaho, Nov. 30, 2022.
This new announcement comes as University of Idaho students are away from campus for winter break.

     Summary: A suspect in the deaths of 4 University of Idaho students is arrested in PennsylvaniaEnlarge this image toggle caption Ted S. Warren/AP Ted S. Warren/APHARRISBURG, Pa. — A suspect in the killings of four University of Idaho students was arrested in eastern Pennsylvania, a law enforcement official said Friday.
The slayings initially mystified law enforcement, with investigators unable to name a suspect or locate a murder weapon for weeks.
But the case broke open after law enforcement asked the public for help finding a white sedan seen near the home around the time of the killings.
Goncalves, 21, of Rathdrum, Idaho; Mogen, 21, of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; Kernodle, 20, of Post Falls, Idaho; and Chapin, 20, of Mount Vernon, Washington, were members of the university's Greek system and close friends.
