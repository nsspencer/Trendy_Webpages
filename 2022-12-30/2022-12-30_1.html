     Idaho murders: 28-year-old man arrested in Pennsylvania, sources say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kaylee Goncalves/Instagram(NEW YORK) — A 28-year-old man, Bryan Kohberger, was arrested Friday morning in Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains in connection with the murders of four University of Idaho students, law enforcement sources told ABC News.
Sources said that authorities knew who they were looking for and had tracked Kohberger down to Pennsylvania.
Moscow police officers, members of Idaho State Police, Moscow city leaders and University of Idaho officials will hold a news conference at 1 p.m. local time Friday.
Two other roommates — who police said are not suspects — survived and likely slept through the murders, according to officials.
This new announcement comes as University of Idaho students are away from campus for winter break.

     Suspect in killings of Idaho college students arrested in Pennsylvania
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ﻿The man accused of stabbing four University of Idaho students to death last month has been arrested and will be extradited from Pennsylvania to face charges, police said.
In a news conference Friday afternoon in Moscow, Idaho, authorities said Bryan Christopher Kohberger, 28, was taken into custody late Thursday.
