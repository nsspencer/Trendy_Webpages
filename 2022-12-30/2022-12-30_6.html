     Summary: CNN —Before there were countless TikTok users lip syncing and attempting complicated choreography to pop hits, there was Keenan Cahill – lip-sync extraordinaire.
With little more than a desktop computer and pure passion, Cahill racked up millions of views on his YouTube channel by mouthing the words to hits of the day.
Cahill, a charming, bespectacled musician in his own right, whose videos delighted millions, died Thursday in a Chicago hospital, his manager David Graham confirmed to CNN.
M. Spencer Green/APThese videos often reached the singers behind the hits, beginning with Perry after Cahill lip synced to her “Teenage Dream,” one of his most popular videos.
Per his manager, Cahill became one of the first YouTubers to pass 500 million views on his personal channel.
