     This Is The Reason Trump Hid His Tax Returns For So Long
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty ImagesI t is not a big mystery why Donald Trump refused to release his tax returns.
I wouldn’t do it.”Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s former attorney, gave a similar explanation when asked about Trump’s returns during a 2019 congressional hearing.
The former president’s tax information had never been public until Friday—and some of it still remains shielded after the House Ways and Means Committee released years of paperwork.
The federal tax authority has audited Trump’s tax returns many times over the years.
During Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, his personal tax returns remained hidden.

     Summary: Here are some key takeaways from a review of the documents:Trump had a bank account in ChinaDuring a 2020 presidential debate, Trump was asked about having a bank account in China.
No reported charitable giving in 2020In the final year of his presidency, Trump reported making no charitable donations.
That was in contrast to the prior two years, when Trump reported about $500,000 (£414,060) worth of donations.

Republicans cannot disclose Joe Biden’s tax returns – because they are already public.

     6 years of Trump tax documents released by House Ways and Means Committee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee on Friday publicly released documents related to former President Donald Trump's tax returns covering the six years from 2015 to 2020.
Trump has long fought to keep his tax records private, breaking precedent with previous presidents who made such documents public.
The thousands of pages of tax records released Friday revealed some new information as well as confirmed past reporting about Trump's personal and business finances.
"I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president," Trump said during one debate against Joe Biden in October 2020.
"Ways and Means Democrats are unleashing a dangerous new political weapon that reaches far beyond President Trump, and jeopardizes the privacy of every American," Brady said in a statement.

     Trump’s tax returns to be released Friday after long fight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DECEMBER 30, 2022, UPDATE:UNDATED (AP)- Democrats in Congress have released thousands of pages of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns.
The documents include individual returns from Trump and his wife, Melania, along with Trump’s business entities from 2015-2020.
The returns show how Trump used tax law to minimize his liability.
The IRS only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings on April 3, 2019 — more than two years into his presidency — when the Ways and Means chairman, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., asked the agency for information related to the tax returns.
The Joint Committee on Taxation report raised multiple red flags about aspects of Trump’s tax filings, including his carryover losses, deductions tied to conservation and charitable donations, and loans to his children that could be taxable gifts.
