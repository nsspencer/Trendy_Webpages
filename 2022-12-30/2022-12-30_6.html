     The Knicks’ winning streak may have been a fluke after hitting rock bottom
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dec 29, 2022; San Antonio, Texas, USA; New York Knicks forward Julius Randle (30) during the second half against the San Antonio Spurs at AT&amp;T Center.
Mandatory Credit: Scott Wachter-USA TODAY SportsThe New York Knicks are at Rock Bottom.
After winning eight straight games to start the month, New York has now lost five consecutive games, their longest losing streak of the season.
The losses they have suffered recently are making their win streak seem like a fluke.
During the win streak, RJ Barrett said that Randle was “going crazy” and that “he’s hooping.” It would appear that he is still doing just that.

     Spurs 122, Knicks 115: A practice in lethargy — The Strickland: A New York Knicks Site Guaranteed To Make 'Em Jump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was as if the Knicks expected the Spurs, playing without Devin Vassell, to roll over and let them have this victory.
The Spurs, a woeful offense, decided, as many have recently, that the Knicks would be the opponent they couldn’t miss against.
The Spurs got pretty much wherever they wanted on the court using an abundance of off-ball movement and paint penetration.
Following a 15-assist, one-turnover game, Quickley backed that up with seven more assists to just one turnover.
Quickley’s advanced turnover rate provides more possessions for a Knicks offense that can grow stagnant in the half court.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The kind of boring win that the Spurs used to rack up in the regular season without even batting an eye.
With any luck, the Spurs might just be getting back to their old boring selves even sooner than we think.
I follow an inordinate number of Knicks fans on twitter for some reason, and they tweet about the stupid Knicks all the dang time.
I genuinely can’t tell and I refuse to watch a Knicks game unless the Spurs are playing them.
- So you don’t actually hate the Knicks, you’re just saying that in order to get traffic?

     Johnson powers Spurs to 122-115 victory over slumping Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Antonio is now 12-23 on the season, and winners of two out of their last three.
SAN ANTONIO — Julius Randle bullied San Antonio, but the Spurs never backed down.
Keldon Johnson scored 30 points and the Spurs overcame a season-high 41 from Randle to beat New York 122-115 on Thursday night, handing the Knicks their fifth straight loss.
“One of the key points to winning was just being physical because they are a really physical team,” San Antonio guard Romeo Langford said.
“A lot of guys, if they get two quick ones, they are out for the game no matter what,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said.

     'True Pro' Evan Fournier Finally Returns to a Knicks Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Knicks broke into their apparent emergency roster stash on Thursday night.
Injuries to their headliners forced the Knicks to turn to a former starter, as Evan Fournier took to game day hardwood for the first time since Nov. 13.
Fournier was one of three double-figure scorers in a dire effort for the meandering Knicks (18-18).
Even with Rose and Fournier's personally triumphant returns, Cam Reddish remained parked for the 13th consecutive game.

     Shorthanded Knicks show no depth in listless 122-115 loss to Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, they were facing an 11-23 Spurs team without its second-leading scorer, so it seemed like a convenient matchup to pull off a shorthanded loss.
The Knicks were often a step too slow to the ball, and the Spurs got too many open looks.
While some of the poor performance can be excused by the absence of Barrett and Quickley, depth is supposed to be the calling card of this Knicks team.
The other issue besides the Knicks’ sudden lack of depth was the choices that Thibodeau made with the rotation.
Instead, Thibodeau opted to bring in Evan Fournier, one of the Knicks’ worst defenders, and the Spurs immediately went on a 9-0 run.

You don’t know what doesn’t mean anything for New York Knicks fans, though?
“It’s a game at a time, I’m just focused on today’s game,” said the forward before the game.
