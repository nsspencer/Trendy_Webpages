     Rosendale, Zinke divided on U.S. House speaker vote
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But even before the new Congress meets, it appears Rep. Matt Rosendale and Rep.-elect Ryan Zinke may be divided on one of the first decisions they have to make – selecting a new House speaker.
Rosendale, Montana’s current at-large and future eastern district representative, has been one of five congressional Republicans who have publicly threatened to vote against the current GOP leader in the House, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California.
McCarthy must win a majority of the House – 218 members if everyone votes – in order to become speaker.
In November, as House Republicans held an internal vote to nominate McCarthy as their candidate for speaker, Rosendale expressed strong opposition in a series of tweets.
We need a leader who can stand up to a Democrat-controlled Senate and President Biden, and unfortunately, that isn’t Kevin McCarthy.

     DCCC: Tom Kean Jr. Goes All in on MAGA Kevin McCarthy For Speaker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yesterday, vulnerable Rep.-elect Tom Kean Jr., along with 14 other vulnerable Republicans, signed a letter claiming that they would ONLY vote for MAGA extremist Kevin McCarthy in his increasingly competitive bid to become Speaker of the House.
Here are just a few of the extreme and dangerous things Kevin McCarthy has done in the past two years, that Tom Kean Jr. is now apparently fully endorsing: Failing to condemn or punish threats of violence, racism, and anti-semitism from GOP members like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul GosarAuctioning off power and influence to MAGA extremist Marjorie Taylor Greene in return for her support in his bid for speakerConceding to demands from extremist members in order to garner enough support in the narrow majorityTrying to derail the January 6th committee from investigating the deadly attack and coup attempt on the US CapitolCoddling Donald Trump on the campaign trail and at Mar-a-Lago just weeks after the former president incited an insurrectionRemaining silent on Rep.-elect George Santos’ (NY-03) fraudulent actions and continued liesAnd countless vows to push for legislation that would move our country backwards, raise prices and grant tax breaks for the wealthiest corporations, and prioritize political vendettas over solutions that will improve the lives of everyday Americans DCCC spokesperson Tommy Garcia:“Whether or not Kevin McCarthy becomes speaker, Tom Kean Jr. is telling voters that he wants a cowardly, self-serving, dangerous person to be third in line for the presidency and that he is willing to be the deciding vote for every disastrous plan that may follow.”
