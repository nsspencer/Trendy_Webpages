     Clemson QB Cade Klubnik makes major error at end of trying first half in Orange Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clemson football quarterback Cade Klubnik is going through some freshman pains in his first career start.
The Tigers are on pace for 546 yards, and all seven first-half drives finished in Tennessee territory.
But Klubnik again sprinted up the middle on third down and was stopped after a two-yard gain with about five seconds remaining.
Clemson coach Dabo Swinney came over to Klubnik to give him some words of advice and encouragement as Klubnik seethed on the field.
Klubnik finished the first half at 16 of 29 passing for 201 yards.

     History behind Clemson’s $2 bill tradition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (FOX Carolina) - For Clemson fans, when you pack to go to an away game there are some essentials you probably bring such as your Clemson attire and $2 bills.
45 years later, the tradition of bringing and spending $2 bills at Clemson away games is still going strong.
And so it’s a great tradition and a lot of people participate in it,” said George Duncan.
Duncan is in Miami from Gaffney for the Orange Bowl and can’t make road trips for Clemson football games without $2 bills.
Spread out through cities around America, the $2 bill stamped at home or the bank with a Tiger Paw is a point of pride for Clemson fans.
