     In White Noise, Noah Baumbach takes Netflix’s money and runs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When books are written about Netflix’s grand investment in prestige cinema, Noah Baumbach’s White Noise may go down as the movie that finally killed the goose that laid the golden budgets.
Adapted from the beloved 1985 Don DeLillo novel, White Noise is a baffling, uneven, sporadically enthralling movie about the collective psychosis of 1980s America and a dry run for the end of the world.
Later, Baumbach shows he can mix action with comedy in a farcical station-wagon car chase that could easily hail from a Chevy Chase movie from the period in which White Noise is set.
Sometimes, Baumbach seems more instinctively aligned with the pop culture DeLillo was critiquing than with DeLillo himself.
Driver’s intensity often leads his comic skills to be overlooked, so it’s a pleasure to find as unlikely a film as White Noise bringing them to the fore.

     White Noise review: bold, strange, and disappointing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The film is, in other words, ambitious, and as far as adaptations go, White Noise is as bold and unapologetically strange as it gets.
White Noise, in turn, returns to the same level of emotional separation throughout its final third that had previously dominated its opening act.
Instead, they come across more like bullet points on the list of ideas that White Noise is so unwaveringly committed to exploring.
White Noise is too self-conscious to allow any of its other actors to accomplish something similar.
White Noise is streaming now on Netflix.

     How ‘White Noise’ pulled off the year’s strangest, most surprising dance number
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “So it’s a dance of life, which is also a dance of death.
They’re the same.”We asked Baumbach and key members of his creative team to break down the film’s unexpected and oddly delightful end credits dance number.
“Even when it’s not an entertaining dance number, I like to have that time to just sit with the experience at the end of a movie.
“Both are sort of true in a way.”Working with choreographer David Neumann, Baumbach looked at ceremonial dances of death from around the world for inspiration.
It was only after the dance number had been shot that Murphy delivered the finished song.

     What Noah Baumbach’s White Noise is really about
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s a white noise machine in my bedroom.
Now technically unnecessary, the white noise machine still goes on every night.
They’re everywhere in White Noise, set in an era when the internet hadn’t yet blanketed the world.
As if “reality” — even reality as overwhelming as a toxic airborne cloud or, say, a pandemic — can’t impinge too long on the white noise.
But like the white noise machine I need to sleep, even though there’s nothing to drown out anymore, we’ve become so dependent on our cultural white noise that the idea of living without it is almost unbearable.
