That all means his return has an added layer of complexity that you might not see with other billionaires."

     Summary: House Democrats release Trump's tax returnsEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesFormer President Donald Trump's tax returns from 2015 through 2020 have been made public by the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee — concluding a years-long political battle by Democrats to obtain and share the documents.
The committee released the tax returns Friday morning on its website and provided no new additional information or statements.
Present on each year of Trump's tax returns was additional income in the form of related-party loans to several of Trump's children, totaling approximately $51,000 annually from 2015 to 2019 and $46,000 in 2020.
This fall, Trump continued his attempts to halt the release of the information, requesting the Supreme Court bar the Ways and Means Committee from making the tax returns public.
We think Democrats will come to regret this, and I think they may regret it sooner than they think."

     Summary: Here are some key takeaways from a review of the documents:Trump had a bank account in ChinaDuring a 2020 presidential debate, Trump was asked about having a bank account in China.
No reported charitable giving in 2020In the final year of his presidency, Trump reported making no charitable donations.
That was in contrast to the prior two years, when Trump reported about $500,000 (£414,060) worth of donations.
Trump vows paybackTrump broke political tradition by not releasing his tax returns as a candidate or as president.
Republicans cannot disclose Joe Biden’s tax returns – because they are already public.

     Trump’s tax returns to be released Friday after long fight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DECEMBER 30, 2022, UPDATE:UNDATED (AP)- Democrats in Congress have released thousands of pages of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns.
The documents include individual returns from Trump and his wife, Melania, along with Trump’s business entities from 2015-2020.
The returns show how Trump used tax law to minimize his liability.
The IRS only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings on April 3, 2019 — more than two years into his presidency — when the Ways and Means chairman, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., asked the agency for information related to the tax returns.
The Joint Committee on Taxation report raised multiple red flags about aspects of Trump’s tax filings, including his carryover losses, deductions tied to conservation and charitable donations, and loans to his children that could be taxable gifts.
