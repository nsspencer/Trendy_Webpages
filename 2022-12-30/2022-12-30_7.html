    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LeBron James may epitomize that mindset — he is one of the greatest players ever to lace up a pair of hightops (or, currently, low-tops), a combination of athleticism and basketball IQ few, if any, could ever match.
LeBron turns 38 today — playing better than anyone ever has at his age — and we need to appreciate that.
For any true fan of the game, it is a joy to watch LeBron James play basketball.
LeBron will take the court tonight in Atlanta (and it’s bad news for the stumbling Hawks because LeBron has put up big numbers on his birthday before).
