     The Biggest Selection Change Needed For West Ham vs. Brentford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lukasz Fabianski was not the sole reason West Ham lost to Arsenal.
A spark is needed in the first team for West Ham and it could start by refreshing the keeper against Brentford.
If not, why did David Moyes and West Ham sign Alphone Areola this offseason?
Instead, Areola has been made the Cup and Europa Conference League keeper where he’s played nine matches and kept four clean sheets.
Simply put, Areola is far too good to be West Ham’s Cup keeper.

Kicking off Friday’s action in the Premier League, West Ham welcome cross-town rival Brentford for a London Derby.
West Ham United Spiraling Due to Offensive StrugglesAfter advancing to the Europa League semifinals a season ago, things have not gone to plan for manager Davis Moyes through the opening 16 games.
Any lengthy absence would really hurt the Bees, as Toney’s 11 league goals only trail Harry Kane and Erling Haaland.
However, it is hard for me to trust this struggling West Ham attack at those odds.

     West Ham United vs Brentford LIVE: Premier League result, final score and reaction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Dasilva of Brentford scores their side's second goal past Lukasz Fabianski of West Ham (Getty Images)Brentford striker Ivan Toney scored one goal and made another as his side won 2-0 to hand West Ham a fifth straight Premier League defeat on Friday and leave the Londoners hovering just above the relegation zone as 2022 draws to a close.
West Ham midfielder Declan Rice shaved the outside of the far post with an early shot and was left to rue that miss when Toney reacted quickest to stab the ball home from close range following a long Brentford throw-in after 18 minutes.
Toney turned provider from another throw-in just before the break as he teed up Josh Dasilva to score, and the home fans expressed their frustration by booing loudly as the players left the field at halftime.
West Ham tried hard but did little to threaten in the second half and Brentford’s only cause for concern came in stoppage time when Toney was taken off on a stretcher with a suspected knee injury.
The defeat leaves West Ham in 17th place just a point above the drop zone, while Brentford move up to ninth on 23 points.
