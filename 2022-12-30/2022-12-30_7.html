     Summary: House Democrats release Trump's tax returnsEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesFormer President Donald Trump's tax returns from 2015 through 2020 have been made public by the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee — concluding a years-long political battle by Democrats to obtain and share the documents.
The committee released the tax returns Friday morning on its website and provided no new additional information or statements.
Present on each year of Trump's tax returns was additional income in the form of related-party loans to several of Trump's children, totaling approximately $51,000 annually from 2015 to 2019 and $46,000 in 2020.
This fall, Trump continued his attempts to halt the release of the information, requesting the Supreme Court bar the Ways and Means Committee from making the tax returns public.
We think Democrats will come to regret this, and I think they may regret it sooner than they think."

"He started out in real estate, and that creates a level of complexity between valuations, revenues, losses and depreciation.
That all means his return has an added layer of complexity that you might not see with other billionaires."

     This Is The Reason Trump Hid His Tax Returns For So Long
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty ImagesI t is not a big mystery why Donald Trump refused to release his tax returns.
I wouldn’t do it.”Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s former attorney, gave a similar explanation when asked about Trump’s returns during a 2019 congressional hearing.
The former president’s tax information had never been public until Friday—and some of it still remains shielded after the House Ways and Means Committee released years of paperwork.
The federal tax authority has audited Trump’s tax returns many times over the years.
During Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, his personal tax returns remained hidden.

     Trump’s tax returns to be released Friday after long fight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DECEMBER 30, 2022, UPDATE:UNDATED (AP)- Democrats in Congress have released thousands of pages of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns.
The documents include individual returns from Trump and his wife, Melania, along with Trump’s business entities from 2015-2020.
The returns show how Trump used tax law to minimize his liability.
The IRS only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings on April 3, 2019 — more than two years into his presidency — when the Ways and Means chairman, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., asked the agency for information related to the tax returns.
The Joint Committee on Taxation report raised multiple red flags about aspects of Trump’s tax filings, including his carryover losses, deductions tied to conservation and charitable donations, and loans to his children that could be taxable gifts.

     Trump tax returns show China bank account as six years of records released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A House of Representatives report released earlier this month analyzed the documents and showed Trump and his wife Melania paid no federal income tax in 2020, the last full year he was in office.
The couple paid $641,931 in federal income taxes in 2015, the year Trump began his campaign for president.
Trump reported bank accounts in Britain, China and Ireland from 2015 to 2017, and from 2018 only reported a bank account in Britain.
The returns span nearly 6,000 pages, including more than 2,700 pages of individual returns from Trump and Melania and more than 3,000 pages from Trump’s businesses.
In 2016, he became the first major-party candidate for president in four decades to refuse to release his tax returns.
