     Summary: Describing her outfit on the day - a black cap perched on the back of her bright orange hair, a dress with campaign badges and tiny silver horns on her head - she said she was supposed to look "a bit like Che Guevara, an urban guerrilla", the prominent figure of the Cuban Revolution in 1950s, who later became a symbol of rebellion.

     Iconic Fashion Designer Vivienne Westwood Dies in London
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Iconic fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, whose clothing defined Britain’s infamous punk era of the 1970s, died Thursday at the age of 81, her eponymous brand confirmed on Instagram.
Westwood died “peacefully and surrounded by her family, in Clapham, South London,” a statement said.
“One of my very favorite Costume Institute shows, Anglomania, celebrated British fashion, but really it was a celebration of Vivienne.
She was at the heart of it all, the designer that every single designer wanted to meet at the Gala.
Time and her commitment to fashion, design, and her environmental campaigning solidified her reputation—and her status as a leader of not just British fashion design, but design more generally.
