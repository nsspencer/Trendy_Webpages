Kicking off Friday’s action in the Premier League, West Ham welcome cross-town rival Brentford for a London Derby.
West Ham United Spiraling Due to Offensive StrugglesAfter advancing to the Europa League semifinals a season ago, things have not gone to plan for manager Davis Moyes through the opening 16 games.
Any lengthy absence would really hurt the Bees, as Toney’s 11 league goals only trail Harry Kane and Erling Haaland.
However, it is hard for me to trust this struggling West Ham attack at those odds.

     West Ham United vs. Brentford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brentford striker Ivan Toney scored one goal and made another as his side won 2-0 to hand West Ham United a fifth straight Premier League defeat on Friday and leave the Londoners hovering just above the relegation zone as 2022 draws to a close.
West Ham midfielder Declan Rice shaved the outside of the far post with an early shot and was left to rue that miss when Toney reacted quickest to stab the ball home from close range following a long Brentford throw-in after 18 minutes.
West Ham manager David Moyes threw on Michail Antonio up front in the 64th and, though he brought physicality and energy, the Hammers still lacked quality in attack with defender Craig Dawson coming closest to scoring with an 82nd-minute header.
West Ham had a couple of late set pieces but Brentford's only cause for concern came in stoppage time when Toney was taken off on a stretcher with a suspected knee injury.
The defeat leaves West Ham in 17th place just a point above the drop zone, while Brentford move up to ninth on 23 points, and the only reason there were not more boos for the hosts at the end was that most of the home fans had long since left.

     Brentford buzz to victory over West Ham, but Ivan Toney suffers knee injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thomas Frank’s men learned from their Monday missteps and turned in a complete, 90-minute performance against West Ham (14 points – 17th place).
Star striker Ivan Toney left the field on the back of a golf cart after suffering what appeared to be a serious injury to his right knee.
It was 2-0 in the 43rd minute, when Aaron Cresswell misjudged a throw-in over top of the West Ham defense.
At least in the Premier League.
Declan Rice is doing his best to hold things together but Jarrod Bowen, Michail Antonio and Gianluca Scamacca just aren’t seeing enough of the ball and West Ham aren’t creating enough chances.
