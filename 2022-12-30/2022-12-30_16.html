     Notre Dame QB Tweets Viral Clip After Irish Beat South Carolina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Notre Dame quarterback Tyler Buchner produced a roller coaster of a performance in the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl on Friday.
The final touchdown lifted Notre Dame to its first bowl game win since the 2019 Camping World Bowl.
After overcoming the two-touchdown deficit to win the game, Buchner posted the perfect popular reaction video that encapsulated his performance.
When it looked like Notre Dame was headed for another loss in a bowl game, Buchner delivered when it mattered most.
In a game in which he became the only FBS player over the last 25 seasons with at least two passing touchdowns, two rushing touchdowns and two pick sixes in a game, it truly was a “back from the dead” moment.

     Notre Dame Notebook: Second Half Surge Secures Victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Notre Dame’s defense rose to the occasion in the second after appearing off balance the entire first en route to a 24-17 halftime deficit.
“They didn’t do anything different, we just didn’t perform as well as we needed to,” said South Carolina head coach Shane Beamer of the Irish defense.
They kind of did what they do.”Irish cornerback TaRiq Bracy, didn’t disagree, noting the adjustment was as much physical as mental.
I mean, that's the biggest deal.”Irish head coach Marcus Freeman concurred, and that was part of his halftime message.
They gave up 10 points the first half on defense.”“All I told them was: stop beating Notre Dame, and they were able to go out and put it all together that second half, and I think they only gave up seven points in the second half.”

     Fighting Irish 4-1-1 - South Carolina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saturday afternoon’s Gator Bowl matinee featuring a pair of resurgent programs, Notre Dame and South Carolina, most closely resembled the Fighting Irish’s debut campaign under first-year coach Marcus Freeman.
The Fighting Irish, despite quarterback Tyler Buchner making just his third career start and first in 16 weeks, were the more poised group – if not quite always the sharpest.
In the second half, everything changed up front for the Fighting Irish.
9, 9: Notre Dame notched nine tackles for losses against South Carolina and added an additional nine quarterback hurries.
But Freeman’s “For The Brotherhood” culture, timely dynamics from individuals, and collective work in all three elements lifted Notre Dame to victory.
