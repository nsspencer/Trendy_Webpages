"He started out in real estate, and that creates a level of complexity between valuations, revenues, losses and depreciation.
That all means his return has an added layer of complexity that you might not see with other billionaires."

     House Democrats release Trump's tax returns

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Democrats release Trump's tax returnsEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesFormer President Donald Trump's tax returns from 2015 through 2020 have been made public by the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee — concluding a years-long political battle by Democrats to obtain and share the documents.
The committee released the tax returns Friday morning on its website and provided no new additional information or statements.
Present on each year of Trump's tax returns was additional income in the form of related-party loans to several of Trump's children, totaling approximately $51,000 annually from 2015 to 2019 and $46,000 in 2020.
This fall, Trump continued his attempts to halt the release of the information, requesting the Supreme Court bar the Ways and Means Committee from making the tax returns public.
We think Democrats will come to regret this, and I think they may regret it sooner than they think."

     Trump’s tax returns released, launching fresh scrutiny of his finances
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Democrats say their investigation of Trump’s taxes and a mandatory presidential audit program will transform accountability for the most powerful person in the country.
Despite the release of the returns, significant questions may still go unanswered, Steve Rosenthal of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said.
The “elephant in the room” is those earlier returns that were not ultimately subject to the Ways and Means scrutiny.
“The ‘Trump’ tax returns once again show how proudly successful I have been and how I have been able to use depreciation and various other tax deductions as an incentive for creating thousands of jobs and magnificent structures and enterprises,” he said in his email.
Trump’s representatives protested when it was suggested that the IRS bring in two more auditors to help handle the sizable paperwork.

     Trump tax returns show China bank account as six years of records released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A House of Representatives report released earlier this month analyzed the documents and showed Trump and his wife Melania paid no federal income tax in 2020, the last full year he was in office.
The couple paid $641,931 in federal income taxes in 2015, the year Trump began his campaign for president.
Trump reported bank accounts in Britain, China and Ireland from 2015 to 2017, and from 2018 only reported a bank account in Britain.
The returns span nearly 6,000 pages, including more than 2,700 pages of individual returns from Trump and Melania and more than 3,000 pages from Trump’s businesses.
In 2016, he became the first major-party candidate for president in four decades to refuse to release his tax returns.
