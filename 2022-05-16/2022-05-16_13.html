     Taylor Swift Was On Set For Joe Alwyn's 'Friends' Sex Scenes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn have been dating since 2016, and at this point, anything goes when it comes to each other’s careers, right?
Well, that idea has been put to the test lately as Swift was on set for the filming of Hulu’s brand new TV series Conversations With Friends, where Alwyn stars as Nick, opposite Alison Oliver’s Frances.
That means Swift was there to witness a number of sex scenes between Oliver and Alwyn too.
The last TV show that was based on one of Rooney’s novels, Normal People, was the most-streamed series in the BBC’s catalog in 2020.
It’s good to see that Swift is being a supportive partner in the process, by all accounts.

     Summary: Taylor Swift is going all out to support her beau, Joe Alwyn for his new Hulu TV series, Conversations With Friends.
Swift added in her caption, 'Can confirm it's phenomenal,' while tagging both Hulu and BBC 3.
The couple rarely discuss their relationship in public, with Alwyn telling British GQ in 2018, 'Someone’s private life is, by definition, private.
Swift has also rarely opened up about their romance, though she did mention it in the 2020 documentary Miss Americana.
We decided together we wanted our relationship to be private,' she said.
