     Jack Nicklaus blames ‘cancel culture’ for Trump course losing PGA Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The PGA Championship was supposed to take place at Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster this week, and the fact that it is not remains a point of bitterness for supporters of the 45th president.
He took the job because he thought he could give the PGA of America some good guidance.
Donald Trump may be a lot of things, but he loves golf and he loves this country.
“On Jan. 5, we were going to Bedminster,” Waugh said.
However, he believed that keeping the major at the Trump course was an “existential” risk.

     Summary: Now here we are, heading into a PGA Championship being held at a 12th-hour (pretty much) venue and without its defending champion in the field.
You could ascribe the course change, ultimately, to lawlessness.
Had those Jan. 6 protests been peaceful, this 104th PGA Championship would have been played at Trump National in Bedminster, N.J. You could ascribe Mickelson’s decision not to play this week, ultimately, to his lust for more and his displeasure with the status quo.
He revealed to us a side of Mickelson we didn’t know, not really.
We didn’t know how restless.
