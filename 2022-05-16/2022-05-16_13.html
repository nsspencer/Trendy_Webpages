     Summary: Singer Elle King is the daughter of comic and actor Rob Schneider, but she doesn’t share much with the veteran humorist.
The soulful King, who possesses a sexy and raspy voice, doesn’t sound like anybody else on the circuit.
It’s all about what moves me.”King will be part of the 2022 Spokane County Interstate Fair lineup, following in the footsteps of rapper Nelly and country crooner Cole Swindell, it was announced Monday.
King is the daughter of former model London King and Schneider, who divorced shortly after King was born in 1989.
“But it was my stepfather who probably had the hugest impact on me in terms of music,” King said.
