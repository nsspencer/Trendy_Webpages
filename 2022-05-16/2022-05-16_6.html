“And no amount of authoritarian tolerance is going to change that.”Touché, Dr. Peterson.
“He was angry at God because women were rejecting him,” Peterson said.
That’s actually why monogamy emerges.”I could go on, about Peterson, and all the toxic sludge that he peddles.

Now I’m dating an SI cover star.’ “Despite her boyfriend’s glee, Nu says becoming a model wasn’t exactly a dream of hers.
“I think I was a size 10 then, and the only people working were either a size 2 or a size 14.

     Summary: A controversial clinical psychologist and YouTuber has some thoughts on model Yumi Nu’s Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover.
Dr. Jordan Peterson quote-tweeted The Post’s story on the plus-size model’s cover debut Monday, writing, “Sorry.
Dr. Jordan Peterson deemed curvy model Yumi Nu’s Sports Illustrated Swim cover “not beautiful” in a tweet on Monday.
Still, some seemed to agree with at least some of Peterson’s criticism by honing in on Nu’s plus-size physique.
“She is beautiful, but I’d prefer being in a little bit better shape, especially being on a cover of a mag in a swimsuit.

     Model Yumi Nu On Her Sports Illustrated Cover And Finding Body Confidence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As rain sprinkled down on set in the picturesque Montenegrin countryside, model Yumi Nu was having the time of her life posing for her second appearance in Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue.
Landing another spot in the magazine’s iconic swim edition certainly made sense with the natural progression of Nu’s rapid career ascension — after all, she secured a headline-making Victoria’s Secret campaign and appearances on the covers of Vogue, Vogue Japan, and Teen Vogue all within the last year.
Being an Asian American plus-size model to have broken into its elite ranks puts Nu in an even smaller group.
Case in point: her cover for Vogue Japan’s April issue was the first time a plus-size model appeared on its front page.
In addition to her work as a model, Nu is a pop singer-songwriter.
