     Former Celtics guard Rajon Rondo accused of pulling gun on former partner in family incident (report)
    </h2>

     Summary: Former Celtics guard Rajon Rondo who is currently with the Cleveland Cavaliers allegedly pulled a gun on his former partner and threatened her in front of the couple’s two children last week in a story first reported by TMZ.
Ashley Bachelor was reportedly granted an emergency protective order by a Kentucky judge for himself and her children on May 13.
After an outburst inside the house, Rondo allegedly returned to the scene with a gun and demanded to see his children before eventually leaving the house.
The 36-year-old Rondo has played for nine different teams during his NBA career including the Celtics from 2006-2013.
