     Summary: ‘$18 for a freakin’ beer?’: PGA Championship prices leave golf fans aghastShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailPGA Championship concession prices sent the golf world over the edge on Monday.
At the PGA Championship, you don’t even wanna know.
For $19, fans can upgrade their beer selection to a Stella Artois of a similar size or a Mich Ultra organic hard seltzer.
But the point remains: the PGA Championship isn’t as much of an outlier as it appears in the world of professional sports concessions.
Golf events across the country regularly see concession prices as high (or higher) than those at Southern Hills.
