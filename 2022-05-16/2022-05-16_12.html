     Racist Attack Spotlights Stefanik’s Echo of Replacement Theory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Democrats were quick to point out that attacks like those Ms. Stefanik have lodged have at their core the same grievance as replacement theory.
“The subtext is clear,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said in a speech.
Earlier this year, she refused to denounce Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, after Ms. Greene spoke at a white nationalist event.
Ms. Stefanik, a Harvard graduate who once privately conceded to friends that Mr. Trump was a liability for her party, has embraced her role as one of his unequivocal supporters.
After Mr. Biden derided Republicans who have refashioned themselves in the mold of Mr. Trump as “ultra MAGA,” Ms. Stefanik turned the criticism into a fund-raising opportunity.

     Scrutiny of Republicans who embrace ‘great replacement theory’ after Buffalo massacre
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The massacre by a white supremacist gunman of Black shoppers at a Buffalo grocery store has drawn renewed scrutiny of Republican figures in the US who have embraced the racist “great replacement theory” he is alleged to have used as justification for the murders.
“Did you know: @EliseStefanik pushes white replacement theory?
In a study of the history of great replacement theory in Republican circles, Vice notes that it “isn’t new to American politicians”.
In 2017, the Iowa congressman Steve King, a fierce Trump loyalist, said in a tweet: “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.”Arguably the biggest rightwing apologist for great replacement theory, however, is Carlson, the Fox News host.
Buffalo was not the first time a mass shooter with white supremacist motivations had cited great replacement theory.

     How Elise Stefanik, Tucker Carlson and J.D. Vance sanitize 'great replacement theory' - The Washington Post

     Summary: So it is that the New York lawmaker is lashing out at critics who have noted her flirtation with “great replacement theory” in the wake of the horrific racist shooting in her home state.
Because in this episode we see how Republicans like Stefanik launder and sanitize these ideas in ways that insinuate them ever deeper into mainstream discourse.
Follow Greg Sargent 's opinions Follow AddThe extent to which “great replacement” ideas have migrated from the fringe into something more routine among Republican lawmakers appears new.
Case in point: A speaker floats “great replacement” ideas — then claims it is intended as racially neutral.
So when Stefanik declares herself shocked, shocked that anyone would suggest that nefarious intentions undergird her “great replacement” parroting, remember: This is a key feature of how the whole sordid game is supposed to work.

     High-Ranking Republican Pushes ‘Great Replacement’ Rhetoric Two Days After White Supremacist Mass Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The mass shooting in Buffalo on Saturday was inspired by the great replacement, but that didn’t keep Stefanik from continuing to push the idea that Democrats are trying to replace white people with people of color.
“Democrats desperately want wide open borders and mass amnesty for illegals allowing them to vote,” she wrote on Monday morning.
Carlson has also repeatedly pushed the idea that Americans should take action in response to the “great replacement,” as Media Matters pointed out on Monday.
The “great replacement” conspiracy was rampant throughout his 180-page manifesto.
Stefanik isn’t the only politician or aspiring politician who pushed the political version of the great replacement theory in the wake of Saturday’s shooting.

     Summary: National media outlets and some members of her own Republican party claim Stefanik has embraced replacement theory, the false idea that there’s a plot to outweigh white voters with non-white immigrants.
On Monday's episode of the New York Times podcast The Daily, reporter Nick Confessore explained that part of the scrutiny on Stefanik stems from her campaign ads.
Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger tweeted on Sunday that Stefanik is pushing replacement theory.
On Monday, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney tweeted that Republican leaders are enabling white nationalism, white supremacy, and anti-semitism.
Henderson says racist and white supremacist ideologies do have supporters in Stefanik’s North Country district.
