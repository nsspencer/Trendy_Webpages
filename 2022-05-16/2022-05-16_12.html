     Everton: Frank Lampard team decision indicates £16 million man’s uncertain future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everton were handed a major blow in their Premier League survival pursuit as they lost 3-2 to Brentford at Goodison Park.
When the team sheets came out, Frank Lampard took everyone by surprise by starting Andre Gomes over Allan.
It felt that Lampard trusted the experience and dexterity of Delph over Allan in the time of crisis.
Without another central defender on the bench, one expected a defensive midfielder Allan to come in and sit in front of the defence.
His tackles and interceptions could break up the play and give Everton a fair chance on the counter.

     9-Man Everton Loses 3-2 to Brentford, Still in Danger in EPL (Highlights)
    </h2>

     Summary: InternationalBrentford's Rico Henry, centre, celebrates after scoring his side's third goal during the Premier League soccer match between Everton and Brentford at Goodison Park in Liverpool, England, Sunday, May 15, 2022.
(AP Photo/Jon Super)LIVERPOOL, England — Everton missed the chance to secure its place in the Premier League for another season after having two players sent off in losing 3-2 at home to Brentford on Sunday.
Everton said it was helping police after Brentford’s Rico Henry — who scored the winning goal — and Ivan Toney said that members of their family were racially abused.
The game turned on an 18th-minute red card to Jarrad Branthwaite for pulling back Toney, when Everton was leading 1-0 thanks to Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s goal.
Leeds is a point behind Everton and has one game left, at Brentford on the final day, while third-to-last Burnley still has Aston Villa and Newcastle to play.

The period when it was 11 v 11 it felt like we controlled the game and we should have scored more against a really good side.
If I sat here and it was 11 v 11 and we went 1-0 up and lost 3-2 you can ask me about why it went wrong tactically or individually.

     Summary: The game turned on the red card for Jarrad Branthwaite, who brought down Ivan Toney as the striker chased a clearance from the Brentford area made while Richarlison was clearly having his shirt pulled.
The spat escalated as more players became involved as Everton sought to disrupt Brentford's flow and regroup after the shock of Branthwaite's red card and then the first Brentford equaliser.
On a rare breakaway Richarlison had the home crowd purring, however, as he controlled a long ball - with his back.
Brought on for Seamus Coleman after 84 minutes, his two-footed lunge on Rico Henry was reckless, the red card that followed inevitable to everyone inside Goodison Park.
I tried to do that today and know that I wasn’t up to it in one incident and am truly sorry.

     Summary: Richarlison is angling for a summer move away from Everton (Picture: Getty Images)Richarlison is keen to leave Everton this summer and move to a team challenging for trophies somewhere in Europe, although he would prefere to stay in the Premier League if possible.
The 25-year-old is in his fourth season at Everton and it has been a frustrating one, with the Toffees surprisingly in a relegation battle this campaign.
Goal Brasil report that Richarlison wants to move to a ‘giant’ of European football and to be competing for silverware from next season.
Both Manchester United and Real Madrid have been linked with him in the past, but have not shown much interest as we near the summer transfer window.
The reality is he is playing at a really high level and is a huge focal point of the team.

     Liverpool could get unexpected boost from Everton twist as parallel Premier League races emerge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Merseyside derby is always one of the most anticipated fixtures of the Premier League calendar, but as this season proved, England's top flight provides no guarantees of status, regardless of history.
After Manchester City were held by West Ham earlier in the same day, twin Premier League races emerged in the city of Liverpool — one for the title, one for survival.
For as long as Jürgen Klopp is at Anfield, Everton's next win against the Reds might not be due until beyond 2026.
Effectively, Everton have struggled to provide a competitive threat that stops the Reds from achieving their goals each season.
While the race to stay in the Premier League is still on, it looks as though the rivalry can now continue.
