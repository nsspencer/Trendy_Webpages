     Arizona Cardinals newest hashtag is cringe worthy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the 2022 NFL Draft came around, there was something off about it for the Arizona Cardinals.
Instead, I’m referring to the Cardinals’ hashtag on Twitter suddenly switching from “#BeRedSeeRed” or “#RiseUpRedSea” to something else.
I’m all for something new, but to say that Arizona is a “bird city” fails on two fronts.
First, Arizona is a state and not a city (unless they’re referencing Chicago’s Arizona neighborhood on the extreme far southeast side of the city).
This is just another misstep by the Arizona Cardinals social media department.

     Mets enter Cardinals showdown with bad blood of first series looming
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The rain washed away Monday’s showdown between the Mets and Cardinals, but it remains to be seen whether tensions will also be cooled off since the last time the teams met.
Still, Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said Monday there had not been any warning from or conversations with MLB, regarding the teams’ recent bad blood, ahead of the series.
The series opener featured the Mets’ two-out, five-run rally in the ninth inning to win 5-2.
The middle game, a 3-0 Mets win, included five hit-by-pitches — the Mets getting drilled three times, including Pete Alonso in the head, and the Cardinals twice.
Tensions finally exploded in the series finale, a 10-5 Cardinals win, when Edmundo Sosa was hit by a Carlos Carrasco pitch in the fourth inning, J.D.

     Summary: Tonight, the Cardinals begin a road series against the Big Strong Mets.
They very graciously resisted the urge to put the Cardinals in the hospital, but less graciously won a three-game series.
At the time, the Mets had won every series, and that streak continued for exactly one more series.
I feel decently confident they will split the series, seeing as that tends to happen over most four-game series.
My pick: CardinalsI am 7-7 on individual games and have accurately predicted the series prediction 3 times to one miss.
