     Camila Cabello To Join 'The Voice' As A Coach, Here's Who She's Replacing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Camila and Gwen will be replacing last season's coaches, Kelly Clarkson and Ariana Grande.
Clarkson and her team of sibling trio Girl Named Tom took home the crown and gave her fourth victory before leaving the show.
Ariana appeared for the first time as a coach last season and likely left as she is busy with her new r.e.m.
Her former group Fifth Harmony was formed on The X Factor in 2012.
Earlier this month, Camila announced even more exciting news via social media when she posted a visually stunning video revealing she will perform at the UEFA Champions League Final Opening Ceremony.
