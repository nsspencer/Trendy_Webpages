     Brittanee Drexel: Remains of Upstate NY teen found; suspect charged in 2009 case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Police say they have identified the remains of an Upstate New York teen who went missing on spring break more than a decade ago.
The Democrat &amp; Chronicle reports authorities in South Carolina announced Monday that remains recovered on May 11 have been positively identified as Brittanee Drexel, a 17-year-old girl from Chili, N.Y., who disappeared during a trip to Myrtle Beach in 2009.
The FBI said the remains, found in a wooded area of Georgetown County, were identified through DNA and dental records.
ABC reports Moody is currently in custody after being arrested on an obstruction of justice charge days earlier.
Moody was first identified as a person of interest in 2012 and is now believed to have killed and buried Drexel on April 26, 2009, Weaver said.
