     Ukraine can win this war, NATO chief says; Finland and Sweden move to join military alliance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday that "Ukraine can win this war" following an informal meeting of the group.
His comments came after Finland announced it would apply to join the military alliance in what marks a historic move for the traditionally neutral Nordic country.
Joining the military alliance will "maximize" Finland's security after Russia's unprecedented invasion of Ukraine in February, President Sauli Niinisto said.
Sweden is expected to follow suit, with both applications likely to enflame tensions between NATO and Russia further.
Moscow warned last week of "retaliatory steps" if Finland joined the alliance.

     Putin: Finland and Sweden's NATO entry isn't a threat to Russia, but military expansion will cause a response
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images)President Vladimir Putin said Finland and Sweden's entry into NATO will not create a threat to Russia, but the "expansion of military infrastructure into this territory will certainly cause our response."
"As for the expansion of NATO, including through new members of the alliance which are Finland, Sweden — Russia has no problems with these states.
According to the Russian leader, the NATO expansion is "artificial" as the alliance goes beyond its geographic purpose and is influencing other regions "not in the best way."
According to Putin, the leaders of the CSTO member countries on Monday will adopt a joint statement on military cooperation.
The statement further added, "Sweden's entry into NATO will cause significant damage to the security of Northern Europe and the European continent as a whole."

     Summary: That was the Russian military more than a decade ago when the country invaded Georgia, according to the defense minister at the time.
By any measure, despite capturing territory in the south and east, the Russian military has suffered a major blow in Ukraine.
The number of troops participating was probably half the number advertised, military analysts said.
