     PGA Championship 2022: Fans are freaking out over the beer (and water) prices at Southern Hills
    </h2>

     Summary: We all know inflation is running rampant these days.
I see it on everything from the Chinese takeout I get every weekend to my beloved bottles of Coca-Cola from Costco.
They cost more than $1 per bottle now!
So, yeah, it's rough out there.
But that's nothing compared to the sticker shock fans are in for this week at the 2022 PGA Championship.

     Tiger Woods feeling 'a lot stronger' ahead of PGA Championship

     Summary: (CNN) Tiger Woods says he is feeling "a lot stronger" than he was at the Masters last month as the 15-time major champion ramps up his return to golf at the PGA Championship.
Woods was playing his first tournament for close to 17 months at Augusta National having suffered serious leg injuries in a car crash in February 2021.
He has now arrived at Southern Hill Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- the site of his fourth and most recent PGA Championship victory in 2007 -- for the second men's major of the year.
"But I'll be able to get stronger.
It's going to ache, but that's the way it's going to be.

     2022 PGA Championship DFS Top Plays and Value Picks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The PGA Championship tees off Thursday in Tulsa, so let’s put together a winning DFS strategy.
Ideally, I’d like to get as many teams as possible through to the weekend to help increase my chance of winning.
Rose played well in his last two PGA Championships (ninth and eighth), but he is 17 shots over par in his last six rounds on the PGA Tour.
His form makes the most sense at this level, and I’m going to use him as my third core player.
Of all the groupings, I sense that rostering three players in the $9,000 range may be the optimal lineup structure.
