    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NBA on Monday said it's in the process of gathering more information after veteran point guard Rajon Rondo allegedly threatened a woman with a gun at her house last week.
The woman filed for an emergency protective order against Rondo on Friday in Louisville, Kentucky, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN's Baxter Holmes.
In it, she alleged that Rondo and a child were playing video games Wednesday when she asked the child to separate laundry.
The woman said she locked herself in the house with the kids, and Gentry eventually told her Rondo had left, and she had his gun.
The four-time All-Star and two-time NBA champion played 18 games for the Los Angeles Lakers before a January trade to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
