     Ukraine says more than 260 soldiers evacuated from Mariupol; Sweden and Finland move to join NATO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday that "Ukraine can win this war" following an informal meeting of the group.
His comments came after Finland announced it would apply to join the military alliance in what marks a historic move for the traditionally neutral Nordic country.
Joining the military alliance will "maximize" Finland's security after Russia's unprecedented invasion of Ukraine in February, President Sauli Niinisto said.
Sweden is expected to follow suit, with both applications likely to enflame tensions between NATO and Russia further.
Moscow warned last week of "retaliatory steps" if Finland joined the alliance.

     Summary: As the Russia-Ukraine war enters its 82nd day, we take a look at the main developments.
FightingRussian forces are targeting civilian and military sites in multiple towns in the Donetsk region including Dovhenke, Ruski Tyshki, Ternova and Petrivka, the Ukrainian military said.
Refugees from Mariupol reached Ukrainian-controlled Zaporizhzhia in a large convoy of cars and vans after waiting days for the Russian military to allow them leave.
Russian forces hit Ukrainian military command posts, ammunition depots, and other military equipment, killing at least 100 Ukrainian “nationalists”, Moscow’s defence ministry said.
Russia’s war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned, and “Ukraine can win this war”, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.

     Russia-Ukraine war: What happened today (May 16)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reuters reported buses carried Ukrainian fighters out of Mariupol and cited a witness as seeing evacuees arrive in Novoazovsk, an area controlled by Russia-backed separatists.
The Ukrainian military previously said Russian troops were pulling back from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and the war was entering a new, long-term phase.
The fast-food giant had previously paused its operations in the country days after Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February.
The folk-rap group ended their performance with a plea to help Ukraine, Mariupol and Azovstal.
Then came the Ukraine war.
