     Ukraine says more than 260 soldiers evacuated from Mariupol; Sweden and Finland move to join NATO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday that "Ukraine can win this war" following an informal meeting of the group.
His comments came after Finland announced it would apply to join the military alliance in what marks a historic move for the traditionally neutral Nordic country.
Joining the military alliance will "maximize" Finland's security after Russia's unprecedented invasion of Ukraine in February, President Sauli Niinisto said.
Sweden is expected to follow suit, with both applications likely to enflame tensions between NATO and Russia further.
Moscow warned last week of "retaliatory steps" if Finland joined the alliance.

     Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 83 of the invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The evacuation of wounded Ukrainian troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol is under way, Volodomyr Zelenskiy confirmed, with more than 260 fighters transported out of the plant.
Western military sources say that Vladimir Putin is involved in the war in Ukraine “at the level of a colonel or brigadier”.
Ukrainian officials claimed that Ukrainian troops in the country’s north-east had pushed back Russian forces from the city of Kharkiv and advanced as far as the border with Russia.
Ukrainian forces in the east of the country could be slowed by Russia’s ally Belarus, which is mobilising special forces along Ukraine’s northern border, British intelligence has warned.
Russian forces have shelled frontline positions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas area as fighting becomes increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war.

     Russia-Ukraine war: What happened today (May 16)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reuters reported buses carried Ukrainian fighters out of Mariupol and cited a witness as seeing evacuees arrive in Novoazovsk, an area controlled by Russia-backed separatists.
The Ukrainian military previously said Russian troops were pulling back from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and the war was entering a new, long-term phase.
The fast-food giant had previously paused its operations in the country days after Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February.
The folk-rap group ended their performance with a plea to help Ukraine, Mariupol and Azovstal.
Then came the Ukraine war.

     Russia-Ukraine war live updates Ukraine ends Mariupol fight; some Azovstal troops taken to Russian-held areas

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A retired Russian colonel told state media on Monday that the invasion of Ukraine is not going the way Russia is portraying it, and that the global isolation facing the country is more daunting than Russian leaders are letting on.
“And it’s that situation that we need to get out of.”In an extremely rare moment of candour on Russian state TV today, defence columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok gave a damning assessment of Russia's war in Ukraine and his country's international isolation.
It's fairly long but worth your time so I've added subtitles.
As state media host Olga Skabeyeva pushed back on Khodaryonok and said that the Ukrainian forces are “not such a great contingent,” the retired colonel replied that the will of Ukraine mattered more than whether they are “professional” soldiers.
Then, as Skabeyeva attempted to equate Ukrainian forces’ “desire to die” to professionalism, Khodaryonok shot down the state media host’s assertion, saying “it’s a component of an army’s high combat readiness.”

The number of troops participating was probably half the number advertised, military analysts said.
Image This photo released by the Russian military shows Russian pilots with a Sukhoi Su-34 strike fighter, in 2015, in Latakia, Syria.
And that is only the public portion of Russia’s military budget.
The war in Ukraine exposed the fact that the Russian military is “not 10 feet tall, but they are not two feet tall, either,” he said.
