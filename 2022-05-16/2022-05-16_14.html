    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Tom Brady announced that he is returning to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the 2022 season, most believed that it would not be too long before Brady’s partner in crime, Rob Gronkowski, made the same announcement.
But, here we stand on May 16th and Gronkowski has yet to make an official announcement about his plans for 2022.
“I’ll represent a 7 jersey in the stands for ya,” Gronk responded.
Embed from Getty ImagesThat response could be a major hint as to what Gronkowski decides to do in 2022 and it sure does sound like he will be watching from the stands, rather than suiting up for the Buccaneers.
Here is the exchange:Nation, do you think Gronkowski will hang up his cleats, or do you think he will be back with the Buccaneers for the 2022 season?
