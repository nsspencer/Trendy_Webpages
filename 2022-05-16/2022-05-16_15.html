     Summary: Woods, 46, played his second nine-hole practice round at Southern Hills Country Club on Monday, after playing the front nine on Sunday.
His last victory in the PGA Championship occurred at Southern Hills in 2007.
"It's only going to keep getting stronger," Woods told reporters Sunday.
With a victory at the PGA Championship, Woods would become the PGA Tour's winningest golfer with 83 career victories.
"I'm not going to play that much going forward, so anytime I do play, it's going to be fun to play and to compete.

     Summary: How course design will create some awkward moments at the PGA ChampionshipShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailOff in the distance, Adri Arnaus waits on the 3rd hole for Lee Westwood to hit his approach on the 6th.
The golf course Tetris of how the 13th interacts with the 16th, or the 6th with the 7th, is very much part of this PGA Championship.
The tee shot that trickles long of the 6th green will suddenly find itself on the 7th tee box.
When Adri Arnaus took to that tee box Monday, he crossed the eyesight of Shane Lowry, who peered out from the 6th tee.
Tee shots from the 7th tee make for tricky green reading on the 6th.

Of the 156 in the field at the PGA Championship – all entrants are professionals; it’s the only major sans amateurs – 17 were at Southern Hills for the 2007 PGA.
That week, daytime highs reached 100 degrees with higher heat indices, so an excessive heat warning was in effect throughout.
He’ll also be reserved spots in the next five editions of the other three majors, and his PGA TOUR membership will be extended through the 2026-27 if it already isn’t.

     PGA Championship 2022: Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson reverse roles one year after Lefty's shocking win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's impossible to think about Tiger Woods playing the 2022 PGA Championship and not consider the absence of his most-heralded contemporary, Phil Mickelson.
He went into the week of the 2021 PGA Championship without a top 20 finish since August 2020.
If Mickelson taught us anything about historically great players at the PGA Championship last year, it was exactly that.
Woods is showing up at the PGA Championship the same way Mickelson showed up at last year's event: with no chance of winning.
He's showing up because he loves golf and takes his status as a champion of this event seriously.

     Summary: USA TodayFor the first time in 15 years, Southern Hills CC is set to host the PGA Championship.
Phil Mickelson is out, but Tiger Woods appears ready to play at the site of his PGA Championship victory in 2007.
Woods will have a few factors going for him at Southern Hills that he did not at Augusta National.
Southern Hills hasn’t staged a PGA since Woods prevailed by three shots in 2007.
Bob Harig: This is not the same course Woods won on in 2007.
