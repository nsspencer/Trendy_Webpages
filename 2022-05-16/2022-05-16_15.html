     Review: ‘Downton Abbey’ film sequel hooks you as new details come to light
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s a quality to the dialogue in “Downton Abbey: A New Era,” unlike anything usually encountered on film.
Perhaps the answer is that despite the milieu it depicts, “Downton Abbey: A New Era” is lowdown, lowbrow art.
And so, a rush of technicians and craftsmen, not to mention a couple of big-name movie stars, converge on the Abbey.
But the South of France story develops nicely, as well, and the beauty of the location gives the film a boost.
In scene after scene, as the sorrowful yet good-humored Lady Mary, Dockery makes us believe it.

     Is Downton Abbey Finally Coming to an End?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the name suggests, "Downton Abbey: A New Era" brings the Crawleys of "Downton Abbey" into a brand-new era.
It's been over a decade since viewers were first welcomed into the halls of Downton, with the first season of the TV series debuting in 2010.
After so many years and stories, is a third "Downton Abbey" movie already in the works, or has the story finally come to an end?
Fellowes also acknowledged the unique challenges of making a movie (or two, or three) based on "Downton Abbey."
For now, "Downton Abbey: A New Era" will likely place a cap on many of the storylines we've followed since the beginning of the series.

     ‘Downton Abbey’ Creator Julian Fellowes Teases Possibility of a Third Film
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Downton Abbey,” the hit British TV series that ran for six seasons on PBS, is making its way onto the big screen for a second time.
Rather than spawning a seventh season, writer and creator Julian Fellowes explained why he decided to transform the series into a film franchise.
That seems fair enough to me.”While “Downton Abbey: A New Era” reunites the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants, it switches up the scenery by heading outside the titular country estate.
That’s come back again.”Blake Ritson and Christine Baranski at the premiere of “Downton Abbey: A New Era” at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City on May 15.
“If there is going to be another episode, I look forward to reading it.”When asked about completing the “Downton Abbey” trilogy, Fellowes said that the fans will say whether a third film should get made.

     Summary: This story contains spoilers for Downton Abbey: A New Era.
“Downton Abbey is just really the gift that keeps on giving.
But [creator and writer] Julian [Fellowes] really managed to do that.

“We now know how Lord and Lady Carnarvon feel every time Downton Abbey trucks turn up,” said Bonneville.

    </h2>

     Summary: Despite being English and one of the dozens of cast members in Downton Abbey: A New Era, Hugh Dancy has never seen Downton Abbey.
In A New Era, Dancy plays Jack Barber, a filmmaker who travels to Downton to shoot his silent film.
Did you watch Downton Abbey, the series, when you landed the role in Downton Abbey: A New Era?
She has a line at some point like, ‘I don't know why I find myself in these situations’ or something, but she clearly does [know].
It's really, really hard to say.
