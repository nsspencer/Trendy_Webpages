     Summary: How course design will create some awkward moments at the PGA ChampionshipShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailOff in the distance, Adri Arnaus waits on the 3rd hole for Lee Westwood to hit his approach on the 6th.
The golf course Tetris of how the 13th interacts with the 16th, or the 6th with the 7th, is very much part of this PGA Championship.
The tee shot that trickles long of the 6th green will suddenly find itself on the 7th tee box.
When Adri Arnaus took to that tee box Monday, he crossed the eyesight of Shane Lowry, who peered out from the 6th tee.
Tee shots from the 7th tee make for tricky green reading on the 6th.
