     Bugs Bunny gets what he deserves in this new MultiVersus trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Audio player loading…Nobody really said it better than Twitter user DJMCTV who wrote that the latest MultiVersus trailer was "like mixing cereal."
The Smash Bros.-style brawler dumps a bunch of iconic Warner Bros. characters like Batman, Bugs Bunny, and (Ultra Instinct) Shaggy into the same bowl and slides it over to you.
Trying to describe this trailer is like trying to describe what goes on in Fortnite to anyone born before the new millennium.
You have Batman standing next to Shaggy who punches Bugs Bunny square in the face.
You'll also be able to gather friends and other players into guilds in order to help organize matches.

     The Iron Giant gets to meet Superman in Warner’s Smash Bros.-like, MultiVersus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warner Bros. Games’ take on the Smash Bros. formula, MultiVersus, adds three more characters to its crossover roster: the Tasmanian Devil (aka Taz) from Looney Tunes, Velma from Scooby-Doo, and The Iron Giant from the heart-obliterating animated movie of the same name.
The Iron Giant even gets to rub shoulders with Superman in that trailer, which remains bittersweet, somehow.
Monday’s new trailer for MultiVersus coincides with the announcement of an open beta coming for the four-player brawler this July.
Warner Bros. Games and developer Player First Games hope to distinguish MultiVersus from similar games, like Super Smash Bros.
The companies also promise full cross-play support — MultiVersus is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X — and “dedicated server-based rollback netcode and content-filled seasons.”

     MultiVersus Confirms 3 New Characters for the Roster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now Warner Bros. is throwing its hat in the ring with MultiVersus, a crossover fighting game that features characters from various WB properties.
MultiVersus was first revealed late last year with a trailer that confirmed just how diverse the game's roster would be.
And now WB has released a brand-new cinematic trailer for MultiVersus that confirms three more characters for the ever-expanding roster, while also confirming when the open beta is coming.
RELATED: MultiVersus Reveals Alternate Costumes for ShaggyAs seen in the new MultiVersus cinematic trailer, the Tasmanian Devil from Looney Tunes, The Iron Giant, and Velma from Scooby-Doo are joining the lineup of playable characters.
Perhaps more MultiVersus stages will be revealed, or maybe even more characters will be shown off.
