     The Boys’ first season 3 trailer has Homelander doing damage control
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This has been obvious since the series’ very first episode, and while it’s occasionally felt like the organization might be on the brink of getting its comeuppance, a new trailer for The Boys’ upcoming third season makes clear that Vought’s nowhere near giving up.
Were the truth about Vought to ever fully catch on in the general public, one might imagine that the company might immediately crumble.
But the season 3 trailer finds Vought holding up quite well as Homelander (Antony Starr) does some damage control while promoting Vought’s upcoming movie about the Seven.
But the way Homelander’s obviously cracking apart mentally points to The Boys’ larger exploration of Vought’s self-destruction not being over just yet.
The Boys’ third season is slated to hit Amazon Prime on June 3rd.
