     American Idol Semi-Finals 5th Judge: Carrie Underwood Brings Out Season's Best, Top 3 Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She appears to be the only “Idol” alum to do so, which is odd as this is the 20th season.
After that, though, the second round of competition brought out the best we’ve seen all season in pretty much everyone.
Nicolina(“Blown Away,” Carrie Underwood - 18, Toronto, ON) Nicolina was killing this performance, really making it her own, as Carrie said, with a lot of emotion and connection.
HunterGirl(“Undo It,” Carrie Underwood - 23, Winchester, TN) There could not be a better pairing of “Idol” alum and contestant this season than Carrie Underwood and HunterGirl.
It made for a very memorable round, and a huge step up from her Round 1 performance.

     Blown away: Carrie Underwood-themed 'American Idol' night ends with shocking double-elimination
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leah Marlene reacts to the news that she had made the 'American Idol' Season 20 finale.
1 on iTunes just two weeks ago, it seems he has a bright-eyed future, regardless of his Idol defeat.
This week, Huntergirl did “bring the sass” on Carrie’s uptempo “Undo It” — a performance that Katy described as a “party” — but her strong, strutting performance didn’t exactly come with a strong vocal.
She smartly skirted the rules Sunday, and for her Carrie song did the Pretenders’ “I’ll Stand by You” (a song Carrie once performed on an “Idol Gives Back” charity special).
In the meantime, we can just be a little sad that Fritz, Nicolina, and Idol have gone their separate ways.
