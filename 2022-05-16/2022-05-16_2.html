In fact, she was ready to help everyone get iconic pics, lying down on the floor to snap photos of Doja Cat, Fat Joe and DJ Khaled from different angles.
And when she wasn't playing the role of photographer, she was chatting up with friends like Machine Gun Kelly, Megan Fox, Becky G, Anitta and Diplo.
And when Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott arrived with their 4-year-old daughter Stormi Webster, Cara went over to say hello—because who wouldn't?

But she wasn’t alone in celebrating the night...Pansexual model and actress Cara Delevingne seemed to be attached to her hip, and a lot of people on the internet are wondering why.
The two were even seated next to each other at the event, so every time the camera picked up on Megan, Cara was right there.
Fellow artist Doja Cat was sitting directly in front of the two, and fans were living for every Meg and Doja moment, but wishing Cara wasn’t there.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Video footage of Cara Delevingne crashing Megan Thee Stallion's red carpet moment at Sunday's Billboard Music Awards has gone viral on social media.
Model Delevingne, 29, and rapper Megan, 27, were photographed arriving at the star-studded event—held at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena—at a similar time.
As Megan looked on, Delevingne threw Megan's floor-length train into the air, in an apparent attempt to give the musician's images a more dramatic flair.
"Hotties look after hotties on the red carpet," read a caption for the clip, which has been viewed more than 190,000 times since its Sunday upload.
The moment also sparked a wave of memes on Twitter, where fans jokingly portrayed Delevingne as having an obsession with "WAP" hitmaker Megan.
