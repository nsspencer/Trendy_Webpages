    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leslie’s latest project, The Time Traveler’s Wife, finds her collaborating with another icon of geekdom: Sherlock/Doctor Who writer Steven Moffat.
Time travel shows love sending their heroes back to meet Abraham Lincoln or Winston Churchill.
This is awkward for Clare (Leslie), who might come downstairs to find her husband gone.
A mind-bending weepy, The Time Traveler’s Wife delivers chills and spills while also saying something profound about human existence and the eternal shadows cast by trauma and heartache.
The Time Traveler’s Wife continues on Monday 23 May from 8am on Now and at 9pm on Sky Atlantic.

     Early Steven Moffat Doctor Who Episode Inspired By Time Traveler's Wife
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Time Traveler's Wife writer Steven Moffat reveals an early Doctor Who episode of his was actually based on the original novel by Audrey Niffenegger.
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYRelated: The Time Traveler’s Wife Must Avoid Steven Moffat's Story ProblemNow, in an interview with Radio Times, he reveals he was inspired by Niffenegger's novel when he wrote the Doctor Who episode "The Girl in the Fireplace."
It’s about a time-lapse relationship, and I did it quite consciously - knowing I was doing The Time Traveler’s Wife.
At which point I could be more obvious, so I made Doctor Who a wife - River Song.
While Moffat certainly has some high expectations placed on his adaptation of The Time Traveler's Wife, after all these years of being inspired by the material, perhaps no one's expectations are higher than his own.

     How Does Time Travel Work in The Time Traveler’s Wife?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HBO's The Time Traveler's Wife introduces viewers to a very different form of time travel - and here's how it works.
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYRelated: The Time Traveler's Wife Cast, Character, &amp; Changes GuideThe Time Traveler's Wife is presented as a romance, with only the lightest touch of science-fiction added as a justification for its central plot device.
The Time Traveler’s Wife Timeline ExplainedThe two characters in The Time Traveler's Wife have very different timelines (a plot device Steven Moffat borrowed for River Song's timeline in Doctor Who).
Related: The Time Traveler’s Wife Must Avoid Steven Moffat's Story ProblemWhy Time Traveler’s Wife Isn’t A Love StoryThis model of temporal mechanics essentially means The Time Traveler's Wife should not be judged as a love story at all.
This makes The Time Traveler's Wife unique in its romance, a story unlike any other.

     The Time Traveler’s Wife review: sometimes uncomfortable but often rewarding
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rose Leslie and Theo James star in Steven Moffat’s sometimes uncomfortable but often rewarding adaptation of Audrey Niffenegger’s novel The Time Traveler’s WifeThe Time Traveler’s Wife was an odd choice of project for Steven Moffat – and in some ways a risky one, too.
Submitting...Like much of Moffat’s Doctor Who work, The Time Traveler’s Wife is a love story in the wrong order.
Theo James as Henry and Everleigh McDonell as Young Claire, playing board games together (Credit: Macall Polay/HBO)If you can, though, watching The Time Traveler’s Wife proves rewarding.
The Time Traveler’s Wife comes across not as a retread but as an evolution, maybe even a maturation, of his work on Doctor Who.
Ultimately, The Time Traveler’s Wife arrives as probably the best version of itself it could be.

     Summary: Viewers and critics alike have panned the new TV adaptation of the 2003 novel The Tme Traveler's Wife, claiming the plot condones child grooming.
The HBO Max adaptation, which premiered last night and is due to air in the UK tonight on Sky Atlantic, stars Theo James as Henry DeTamble and Rose Leslie as his wife Clare Anne Abshire.
From Henry's perspective, he meets Clare for the first time when she is in her twenties when he's seven years older than her.
'40 mins into Time Traveler’s Wife TV show and I had to quit.
Some reviewers also felt the situation resembled child grooming, which is defined as 'befriending and establishing an emotional connection with a child to lower their inhibitions with the objective of sexual abuse.'
