     How Arsenal dropped points in Champions League race with defeat by Newcastle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal’s dream of playing Champions League football next season was dealt a crushing blow as they were beaten 2-0 by Newcastle United at St James’ Park.
Ben White’s own goal and a rebounded effort from Bruno Guimaraes gave the home side a famous victory in a game they thoroughly dominated.
The Gunners were not at the races at all and created next to nothing throughout the 90 minutes.
Callum Wilson came back into the starting XI and turned in an iconic centre-forward performance.
It was his pressure and run across the front post that led to White turning the ball past Aaron Ramsdale at full stretch in the second half.

     Arsenal loses as Spurs becomes favorite for EPL top-4 spot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEWCASTLE, England (AP) — Arsenal no longer has Champions League qualification in its own hands.
Heading into the final round on Sunday, Tottenham occupies fourth place — two points above Arsenal in fifth — and just needs to beat already-relegated Norwich to guarantee a top-four spot.
Given Tottenham’s far superior goal difference, a draw will highly likely be enough against the league’s last-placed team.
Arsenal will host Everton at the same time and knows a win still might not be enough to get back in the Champions League after a five-year absence.
“We need people to have the (character) to come here and play.”The result meant Chelsea, in third place, was sure of finishing in the top four and qualifying for the Champions League.
