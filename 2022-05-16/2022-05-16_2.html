     Early Steven Moffat Doctor Who Episode Inspired By Time Traveler's Wife
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Time Traveler's Wife writer Steven Moffat reveals an early Doctor Who episode of his was actually based on the original novel by Audrey Niffenegger.
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYRelated: The Time Traveler’s Wife Must Avoid Steven Moffat's Story ProblemNow, in an interview with Radio Times, he reveals he was inspired by Niffenegger's novel when he wrote the Doctor Who episode "The Girl in the Fireplace."
It’s about a time-lapse relationship, and I did it quite consciously - knowing I was doing The Time Traveler’s Wife.
At which point I could be more obvious, so I made Doctor Who a wife - River Song.
While Moffat certainly has some high expectations placed on his adaptation of The Time Traveler's Wife, after all these years of being inspired by the material, perhaps no one's expectations are higher than his own.

     'The Time Traveler's Wife' review: Steven Moffat captures the magic of the book with TV remake
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clare Abshire (Rose Leslie) and Henry DeTamble (Theo James) in The Time Traveler's Wife (Sky/HBO)Literature like The Time Traveler’s Wife always inspires lonely hearts with romantic notions who search for solace in rose-tinted encounters.
A situation that makes The Time Traveler’s Wife solely reliant on their chemistry and charisma, with next to no wriggle room.
As The Time Traveler’s Wife uses its singular plot device to explore soulmates as a tangible ideal, not just a romantic pipe dream.
If The Time Traveler’s Wife does nothing else but convince audiences of that fact, then Steven Moffat can walk away happy.
The Time Traveler’s Wife premieres on Sky Atlantic from 16 May.
