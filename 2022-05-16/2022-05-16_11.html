     Police find Arby's manager peed in milkshake mix while investigating him for child pornography
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Associated PressVANCOUVER, Wash. — A manager at an Arby's fast food restaurant in Washington state has been accused of urinating into a milkshake mix that might then have been served to dozens of people.
Police in Vancouver said they uncovered footage of the 29-year-old man peeing into a bag of milkshake mix as they were executing a search warrant on his phone as part of a child pornography investigation, The Columbian newspaper reported.
The manager made one court appearance last Wednesday on child porn allegations and another on Friday, for a new allegation of second-degree assault with sexual motivation, after police said they found the 16-second urination video.
He said he was working alone in the restaurant that night and that he did it for sexual gratification.
Another manager at the Arby’s told detectives the restaurant sold at least one ice cream float and about 30 to 40 milkshakes that day, court records said.
