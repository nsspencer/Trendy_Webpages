     Summary: That’s what Camila Cabello will be banking on, anyway, when she joins The Voice as a coach for the upcoming 22nd season.
She is replacing Kelly Clarkson, winner of the first season of American Idol, who coached the winner of four out of her eight seasons on The Voice.
(And with The Kelly Clarkson Show readying its fourth season, we won’t be short of her talents on TV.)
Cabello also knows her way around The Voice competition a bit, after previously playing mentor to coach John Legend’s team last season.
And Cabello already seems to be finding harmony with her fellow coaches, announcing her news with a TikTok of her singing Mika’s “Grace Kelly” alongside the other three.

     NBC, Fox offer fall television plans, to a point amid change
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Something was missing when Fox announced its plans for the fall television season: a schedule.
Both NBC and Fox, which kicked off the week Monday, emphasized how the flagship networks were now part of larger media companies.
Fox Entertainment CEO Charles Collier said the network was trying a “new approach” to give equal weight to its Tubi streaming service.
His shows “Chicago Med,” “Chicago Fire” and “Chicago P.D.” occupy the network’s Wednesday night schedule, while “Law &amp; Order,” “Law &amp; Order: SVU” and “Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime” fill Thursday’s prime time.
Among the plans Fox did announce Monday, is expanding the empire of celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay.
