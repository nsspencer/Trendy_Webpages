     Model Yumi Nu On Her Sports Illustrated Cover And Finding Body Confidence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As rain sprinkled down on set in the picturesque Montenegrin countryside, model Yumi Nu was having the time of her life posing for her second appearance in Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue.
Landing another spot in the magazine’s iconic swim edition certainly made sense with the natural progression of Nu’s rapid career ascension — after all, she secured a headline-making Victoria’s Secret campaign and appearances on the covers of Vogue, Vogue Japan, and Teen Vogue all within the last year.
Being an Asian American plus-size model to have broken into its elite ranks puts Nu in an even smaller group.
Case in point: her cover for Vogue Japan’s April issue was the first time a plus-size model appeared on its front page.
In addition to her work as a model, Nu is a pop singer-songwriter.
