We decided together we wanted our relationship to be private,' she said.

     ‘Conversations with Friends’: Director Lenny Abrahamson Wants Audiences to See Joe Alwyn in a Different Way
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, director Lenny Abrahamson, who beautifully rendered Rooney’s “Normal People” for the screen, has returned with another Rooney book.
But their friendship is tested when they meet married couple Melissa and Nick (Jemima Kirke and Joe Alwyn, respectively).
Abrahamson talked with IndieWire via Zoom about adapting another Rooney novel, working with Alwyn, and how internalized characters can be their own challenge.
Lenny Abrahamson: The history of where it came from is relevant in this case, because I read “Conversations with Friends” around the time it came out.
It was in doing that that unlocked what to do [with] “Conversations with Friends” in a funny way.
