     Camila Cabello Joins Coaches Panel for ‘The Voice’ Season 22, Replacing Kelly Clarkson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Season 22 of The Voice is on the horizon — and the hit NBC singing competition is shaking up its lineup of coaches.
With long-time coach Kelly Clarkson heading out, Camila Cabello steps in for her first full-time stint, having served as a team mentor in previous seasons.

     Camila Cabello Replacing Kelly Clarkson on ‘The Voice’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s what Camila Cabello will be banking on, anyway, when she joins The Voice as a coach for the upcoming 22nd season.
She is replacing Kelly Clarkson, winner of the first season of American Idol, who coached the winner of four out of her eight seasons on The Voice.
(And with The Kelly Clarkson Show readying its fourth season, we won’t be short of her talents on TV.)
Cabello also knows her way around The Voice competition a bit, after previously playing mentor to coach John Legend’s team last season.
And Cabello already seems to be finding harmony with her fellow coaches, announcing her news with a TikTok of her singing Mika’s “Grace Kelly” alongside the other three.
