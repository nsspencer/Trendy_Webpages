     Summary: Looks like promising youngster Lewis Warrington will sign a new deal with the club.
[The Athletic]Everton rumoured to be in for 22-year-old Arsenal forward Eddie Nketiah.

Here’s a great piece surrounding the The Grand Old Lady following the legendary’s stadium planned demolition in the near future.

     Everton: Frank Lampard team decision indicates £16 million man’s uncertain future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everton were handed a major blow in their Premier League survival pursuit as they lost 3-2 to Brentford at Goodison Park.
When the team sheets came out, Frank Lampard took everyone by surprise by starting Andre Gomes over Allan.
It felt that Lampard trusted the experience and dexterity of Delph over Allan in the time of crisis.
Without another central defender on the bench, one expected a defensive midfielder Allan to come in and sit in front of the defence.
His tackles and interceptions could break up the play and give Everton a fair chance on the counter.

     Ex-FIFA referee gives reason for major decision in Everton loss v Brentford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Daniel Feliciano 16th May, 2022 | 8:40pmDermot Gallagher explains why VAR didn't give Everton penalty in Richarlison incidentDermot Gallagher believes VAR would not have overturned Michael Oliver’s decision if he’d given Everton a penalty for a shirt pull on Richarlison against Brentford.
I would suggest that if Michael Oliver gave this as a penalty, the VAR would go with him.
Ironically, if they go back and give the penalty, Branthwaite would have stayed on the field.
Further confirmation that once again the referee on the day of the game has gone against Everton and Frank Lampard.
Fingers crossed Everton aren’t too badly affected by the decision.

     Summary: “We could have had him for a compensation fee of £60,000,” King says, explaining why Everton decided against signing a then-15-year-old striker back in 2016.

An emphatic finisher blessed with searing pace, Terrier has found the net 16 times in his last 21 matches.

     Summary: And speaking following his side’s win at Goodison, Frank promised the Blues that his side will not be rolling over for the Elland Road club this Sunday.
We will put our very best team out there - it's so important to understand we need to do our very best to win.
“Everyone will do our best to try and win on Sunday, and if Brentford can finish top 10, that's remarkable.
I think Leeds is one of the biggest clubs in the country; they should be in the Premier League with the story and the history.
And Frank took aim after the game at those who suggested that his side were already on their holidays as they have nothing to play for.
