Visionhaus/Getty ImagesEverton are helping police identify fans accused of racially abusing the families of Brentford striker Ivan Toney and defender Rico Henry during Sunday's Premier League clash at Goodison Park.
"But to see my mom upset after being racially abused by a few Everton fans brought fire to my stomach."
Brentford said they were aware of the incidents and a report had been made to the police.
"We will offer our support to Rico's and Ivan's families and will fully cooperate with the investigation and any subsequent legal proceedings," Brentford said.

Here’s a great piece surrounding the The Grand Old Lady following the legendary’s stadium planned demolition in the near future.
“A penalty for the shirt pull means maybe 2-0 and 11 men and, I think, we all know how that game goes in those circumstances,” said Frank Lampard.

     Everton: Frank Lampard team decision indicates £16 million man’s uncertain future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everton were handed a major blow in their Premier League survival pursuit as they lost 3-2 to Brentford at Goodison Park.
When the team sheets came out, Frank Lampard took everyone by surprise by starting Andre Gomes over Allan.
It felt that Lampard trusted the experience and dexterity of Delph over Allan in the time of crisis.
Without another central defender on the bench, one expected a defensive midfielder Allan to come in and sit in front of the defence.
His tackles and interceptions could break up the play and give Everton a fair chance on the counter.

     Summary: Frank Lampard retains full confidence in Everton’s ability to get themselves out of the relegation scrap despite missing the chance to secure safety in Sunday’s 3-2 home defeat to Brentford.
But Lampard has urged his side to bounce back for Thursday’s visit of Crystal Palace when the Toffees have another chance to secure safety.
The period when it was 11 v 11 it felt like we controlled the game and we should have scored more against a really good side.
If I sat here and it was 11 v 11 and we went 1-0 up and lost 3-2 you can ask me about why it went wrong tactically or individually.
Brentford are not taking their foot off the gas (Peter Byrne/PA)“Oh, I think we will put the ‘B’ team out,” he joked.

     9-Man Everton Loses 3-2 to Brentford, Still in Danger in EPL (Highlights)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: InternationalBrentford's Rico Henry, centre, celebrates after scoring his side's third goal during the Premier League soccer match between Everton and Brentford at Goodison Park in Liverpool, England, Sunday, May 15, 2022.
(AP Photo/Jon Super)LIVERPOOL, England — Everton missed the chance to secure its place in the Premier League for another season after having two players sent off in losing 3-2 at home to Brentford on Sunday.
Everton said it was helping police after Brentford’s Rico Henry — who scored the winning goal — and Ivan Toney said that members of their family were racially abused.
The game turned on an 18th-minute red card to Jarrad Branthwaite for pulling back Toney, when Everton was leading 1-0 thanks to Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s goal.
Leeds is a point behind Everton and has one game left, at Brentford on the final day, while third-to-last Burnley still has Aston Villa and Newcastle to play.

     What Salomon Rondon did after Everton red card as Abdoulaye Doucoure fumes with Ivan Toney
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The game turned on the red card for Jarrad Branthwaite, who brought down Ivan Toney as the striker chased a clearance from the Brentford area made while Richarlison was clearly having his shirt pulled.
The spat escalated as more players became involved as Everton sought to disrupt Brentford's flow and regroup after the shock of Branthwaite's red card and then the first Brentford equaliser.
On a rare breakaway Richarlison had the home crowd purring, however, as he controlled a long ball - with his back.
Brought on for Seamus Coleman after 84 minutes, his two-footed lunge on Rico Henry was reckless, the red card that followed inevitable to everyone inside Goodison Park.
I tried to do that today and know that I wasn’t up to it in one incident and am truly sorry.

     Ref Watch: Should Everton have had another penalty vs Brentford for shirt pull on Richarlison?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dermot Gallagher dissects the big flashpoints from the weekend's action and discusses whether Everton should have been awarded another penalty against Brentford for a shirt pull on Richarlison?
VERDICT: The VAR has backed the referee, but would also have cleared his decision if he had given a penalty.
They felt Richarlison was pulling Ajer's shirt and Ajer was pulling his shirt.
I would suggest that if Michael Oliver gave this as a penalty, the VAR would go with him.
When anybody pulls a shirt they are taking a massive risk, but the ref felt Ajer was being pulled as well.
