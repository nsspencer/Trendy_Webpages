     Newcastle vs Arsenal LIVE: Premier League result, final score and reaction tonight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Newcastle celebrate taking the lead against Arsenal (AFP via Getty Images)Bruno Guimaraes dealt Arsenal’s Champions League hopes a major blow as Newcastle powered their way to a deserved win at a raucous St James’ Park.
The £35million Brazilian condemned the Gunners to a costly 2-0 defeat with an 85th-minute strike after Ben White’s own goal had put the Magpies ahead in front of a crowd of 52,274.
As a result, Arsenal will go into Sunday’s final round of fixtures two points behind fourth-placed Tottenham and with their fate out of their own hands.
Victory was no more than Eddie Howe’s side deserved as they bounced back from successive defeats to Liverpool and Manchester City to take their tally to 46 points, the most they have collected since returning to the Premier League in 2017.

     How Arsenal dropped points in Champions League race with defeat by Newcastle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal’s dream of playing Champions League football next season was dealt a crushing blow as they were beaten 2-0 by Newcastle United at St James’ Park.
Ben White’s own goal and a rebounded effort from Bruno Guimaraes gave the home side a famous victory in a game they thoroughly dominated.
The Gunners were not at the races at all and created next to nothing throughout the 90 minutes.
Callum Wilson came back into the starting XI and turned in an iconic centre-forward performance.
It was his pressure and run across the front post that led to White turning the ball past Aaron Ramsdale at full stretch in the second half.
