     Taylor Swift goes all out to support Joe Alwyn, promotes his new Hulu series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Taylor Swift is going all out to support her beau, Joe Alwyn for his new Hulu TV series, Conversations With Friends.
Swift added in her caption, 'Can confirm it's phenomenal,' while tagging both Hulu and BBC 3.
The couple rarely discuss their relationship in public, with Alwyn telling British GQ in 2018, 'Someone’s private life is, by definition, private.
Swift has also rarely opened up about their romance, though she did mention it in the 2020 documentary Miss Americana.
We decided together we wanted our relationship to be private,' she said.

     what is this very modern miniseries about a bisexual millennial who falls in love with a married man worth?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We owe this BBC co-production to the Irish Sally Rooney, who created it based on her first novel, published in 2017.
Two years ago, she did the same thing with another of her books hit, “Normal People”, released in 2018.
One day, they become friends with a journalist, Melissa Conway, who is older than them and arouses their admiration.
Quite quickly, Frances, who had never slept with a man, begins an affair with this one, and attaches herself to it more than she should.
Especially, of course, those of the holidays… What is certain is that the bonds, both beautiful and difficult, of Frances and Nick are accurately described.
