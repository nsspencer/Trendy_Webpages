     Bugs Bunny gets what he deserves in this new MultiVersus trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Audio player loading…Nobody really said it better than Twitter user DJMCTV who wrote that the latest MultiVersus trailer was "like mixing cereal."
The Smash Bros.-style brawler dumps a bunch of iconic Warner Bros. characters like Batman, Bugs Bunny, and (Ultra Instinct) Shaggy into the same bowl and slides it over to you.
Trying to describe this trailer is like trying to describe what goes on in Fortnite to anyone born before the new millennium.
You have Batman standing next to Shaggy who punches Bugs Bunny square in the face.
You'll also be able to gather friends and other players into guilds in order to help organize matches.

     Please Watch This New MultiVersus Game Trailer and Go Insane With Us
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet, we’re all forced to reckon with this very real new trailer for MultiVersus, the WB’s upcoming, Super Smash Bros.-esque brawler in which every moment feels like a purposeful assault on reason and sanity.
Of course, no one needs any reason to want to murder the Tasmanian Devil at any time.
AdvertisementIf you’re hot to trot to watch Garnet from Steven Universe physically assault Velma Dinkley, you’ll have to wait a touch longer—MultiVersus’ open, free-to-play beta test arrives in July, presumably on PC, PlayStations 4 and 5, and XBox Ones and X/Ses.
In closing, the worst part of this trailer is that Bugs didn’t ask Arya, “What’s up, Stark?” It was sitting right there, people, and now I’m going to have to be thinking about it all day.

     Finally, Shaggy can kill the Batman in WB’s MultiVersus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You know, the one where Batman stabs Bugs Bunny with a bat-a-rang and breaks every bone in his little body.
Well, now that dream can be a reality in the WB video game MultiVersus, a jaunty little attempt at encroaching on other studios’ mixed-IP fighting games, like Super Smash Bros. and Marvel Vs. Capcom.
As we’ve seen with WB’s other IP excavations to compete with the Disneys of the world, the studio’s bench is deep.
But it more or less looks exactly like Super Smash Bros., with characters flying all over a memorable WB setting, like the Batcave, and button-mashing their way to victory.
It will be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

     The Iron Giant gets to meet Superman in Warner’s Smash Bros.-like, MultiVersus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warner Bros. Games’ take on the Smash Bros. formula, MultiVersus, adds three more characters to its crossover roster: the Tasmanian Devil (aka Taz) from Looney Tunes, Velma from Scooby-Doo, and The Iron Giant from the heart-obliterating animated movie of the same name.
The Iron Giant even gets to rub shoulders with Superman in that trailer, which remains bittersweet, somehow.
Monday’s new trailer for MultiVersus coincides with the announcement of an open beta coming for the four-player brawler this July.
Warner Bros. Games and developer Player First Games hope to distinguish MultiVersus from similar games, like Super Smash Bros.
The companies also promise full cross-play support — MultiVersus is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X — and “dedicated server-based rollback netcode and content-filled seasons.”

     MultiVersus' Iron Giant Controversy Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RELATED: New Gameplay Leaked for Warner Bros. MultiVersusMultiVersus’ Iron Giant Is Potentially ExploitativeThe Iron Giant’s inclusion has stirred some disappointment in dedicated fans of The Iron Giant film and a thematic message the titular character expresses through its actions.
The Iron Giant’s character is strongly opposed to violence and is taught not to use its built-in weaponry, but Iron Giant is now being used as a cameo mascot who recklessly charges into combat.
If it were up to them, the Iron Giant would not be a part of any title that forces it to engage in combat or violence.
These people seem to see Iron Giant’s inclusion as a fun nostalgia trip to one of their favorite childhood films.
This way, it could be appreciated that they are able to play as Iron Giant in MultiVersus.
