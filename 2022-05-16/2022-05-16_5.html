The Penguins’ Marcus Pettersson lost his helmet after getting tied up with the Rangers’ Alexis Lafreniere in Pittsburgh’s Game 7 loss to New York on Sunday.
I think that’s a rule made by the NHL that could be changed,” Jarry said.
Pittsburgh initially led the best-of-seven series, 3-1, but suffered a blow in Game 5, when Crosby left the game after taking a hit from Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba.
