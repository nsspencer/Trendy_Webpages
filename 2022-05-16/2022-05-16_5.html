     Multiversus confirms new characters and an open beta release date
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warner Bros. Games has revealed new characters set to appear in its online fighting game MultiVersus, and confirmed plans for an open beta.
Also announced on Monday, the MultiVersus open beta will be taking place in July 2022.
The open beta will follow this month’s closed alpha.
Beginning on May 19 and running until May 27, the closed alpha is an invite-only test that will allow players to experience various modes of the game, including a 2vs2 team-based game mode.
Characters confirmed so far include Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Harley Quinn, Shaggy, Bugs Bunny, Arya Stark, Tom and Jerry, Jake the Dog, Finn the Human, Steven Universe, Garnet, and Reindog (an original fighter).

     Bugs Bunny gets what he deserves in this new MultiVersus trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Audio player loading…Nobody really said it better than Twitter user DJMCTV who wrote that the latest MultiVersus trailer was "like mixing cereal."
The Smash Bros.-style brawler dumps a bunch of iconic Warner Bros. characters like Batman, Bugs Bunny, and (Ultra Instinct) Shaggy into the same bowl and slides it over to you.
Trying to describe this trailer is like trying to describe what goes on in Fortnite to anyone born before the new millennium.
You have Batman standing next to Shaggy who punches Bugs Bunny square in the face.
You'll also be able to gather friends and other players into guilds in order to help organize matches.

     The Iron Giant gets to meet Superman in Warner’s Smash Bros.-like, MultiVersus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warner Bros. Games’ take on the Smash Bros. formula, MultiVersus, adds three more characters to its crossover roster: the Tasmanian Devil (aka Taz) from Looney Tunes, Velma from Scooby-Doo, and The Iron Giant from the heart-obliterating animated movie of the same name.
The Iron Giant even gets to rub shoulders with Superman in that trailer, which remains bittersweet, somehow.
Monday’s new trailer for MultiVersus coincides with the announcement of an open beta coming for the four-player brawler this July.
Warner Bros. Games and developer Player First Games hope to distinguish MultiVersus from similar games, like Super Smash Bros.
The companies also promise full cross-play support — MultiVersus is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X — and “dedicated server-based rollback netcode and content-filled seasons.”

     Please Watch This New MultiVersus Game Trailer and Go Insane With Us
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet, we’re all forced to reckon with this very real new trailer for MultiVersus, the WB’s upcoming, Super Smash Bros.-esque brawler in which every moment feels like a purposeful assault on reason and sanity.
Of course, no one needs any reason to want to murder the Tasmanian Devil at any time.
AdvertisementIf you’re hot to trot to watch Garnet from Steven Universe physically assault Velma Dinkley, you’ll have to wait a touch longer—MultiVersus’ open, free-to-play beta test arrives in July, presumably on PC, PlayStations 4 and 5, and XBox Ones and X/Ses.
In closing, the worst part of this trailer is that Bugs didn’t ask Arya, “What’s up, Stark?” It was sitting right there, people, and now I’m going to have to be thinking about it all day.
