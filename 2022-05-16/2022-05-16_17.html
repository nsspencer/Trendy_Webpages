    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s what Camila Cabello will be banking on, anyway, when she joins The Voice as a coach for the upcoming 22nd season.
She is replacing Kelly Clarkson, winner of the first season of American Idol, who coached the winner of four out of her eight seasons on The Voice.
(And with The Kelly Clarkson Show readying its fourth season, we won’t be short of her talents on TV.)
Cabello also knows her way around The Voice competition a bit, after previously playing mentor to coach John Legend’s team last season.
And Cabello already seems to be finding harmony with her fellow coaches, announcing her news with a TikTok of her singing Mika’s “Grace Kelly” alongside the other three.
