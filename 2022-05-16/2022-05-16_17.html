Sign up for the EFC email bulletin for all the latest Everton newsCrystal Palace will spend the night before their trip to Everton in a secret location in a bid to avoid the prospect of being disturbed by fireworks let off by supporters, according to reports.
The Blues will face Patrick Vieira's side at Goodison Park on Thursday evening with the Merseyside club desperate to secure the three points that will ensure their Premier League safety.
And according to the Mail, with Frank Lampard's side fighting for their top flight existence, Palace are not prepared to take any chances with their pre-match preparations.
The Blues currently lie 16th in the table with two games left to fulfil, two points above Burnley and a point ahead of Leeds United, who only have one match left to play.

     Everton: Frank Lampard team decision indicates £16 million man’s uncertain future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everton were handed a major blow in their Premier League survival pursuit as they lost 3-2 to Brentford at Goodison Park.
When the team sheets came out, Frank Lampard took everyone by surprise by starting Andre Gomes over Allan.
It felt that Lampard trusted the experience and dexterity of Delph over Allan in the time of crisis.
Without another central defender on the bench, one expected a defensive midfielder Allan to come in and sit in front of the defence.
His tackles and interceptions could break up the play and give Everton a fair chance on the counter.

I would suggest that if Michael Oliver gave this as a penalty, the VAR would go with him.
Ironically, if they go back and give the penalty, Branthwaite would have stayed on the field.
Further confirmation that once again the referee on the day of the game has gone against Everton and Frank Lampard.
Fingers crossed Everton aren’t too badly affected by the decision.

     Summary: Sign up for the EFC email bulletin for all the latest Everton newsJamie Carragher thinks the decision not to award a penalty to Everton against Brentford was correct, although his Sky Sports colleague Gary Neville disagreed.
However, there was anger at Goodison Park as Richarlison was seemingly fouled in the penalty area seconds earlier.
Carragher and Neville analysed the moment on Monday Night Football and the former said he didn't think the shirt pull warranted a foul being awarded.
But when you look at it in real speed, I don’t think it’s a penalty."
Neville did not agree with that assessment though and reminded Carragher of some previous comments he had made regarding shirt pulling.

     Summary: Dermot Gallagher dissects the big flashpoints from the weekend's action and discusses whether Everton should have been awarded another penalty against Brentford for a shirt pull on Richarlison?
VERDICT: The VAR has backed the referee, but would also have cleared his decision if he had given a penalty.
They felt Richarlison was pulling Ajer's shirt and Ajer was pulling his shirt.
I would suggest that if Michael Oliver gave this as a penalty, the VAR would go with him.
When anybody pulls a shirt they are taking a massive risk, but the ref felt Ajer was being pulled as well.

     9-Man Everton Loses 3-2 to Brentford, Still in Danger in EPL (Highlights)
    </h2>

     Summary: InternationalBrentford's Rico Henry, centre, celebrates after scoring his side's third goal during the Premier League soccer match between Everton and Brentford at Goodison Park in Liverpool, England, Sunday, May 15, 2022.
(AP Photo/Jon Super)LIVERPOOL, England — Everton missed the chance to secure its place in the Premier League for another season after having two players sent off in losing 3-2 at home to Brentford on Sunday.
Everton said it was helping police after Brentford’s Rico Henry — who scored the winning goal — and Ivan Toney said that members of their family were racially abused.
The game turned on an 18th-minute red card to Jarrad Branthwaite for pulling back Toney, when Everton was leading 1-0 thanks to Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s goal.
Leeds is a point behind Everton and has one game left, at Brentford on the final day, while third-to-last Burnley still has Aston Villa and Newcastle to play.
