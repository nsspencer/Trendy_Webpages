A post to her Facebook page said Peterson died in her sleep on Sunday with her family present.
In the 1963 episode, Peterson played the role of Charlene Darling, who along with her father and four musical brothers visited Mayberry and crammed themselves into one hotel room as they waited for her fiance to arrive.

During the next season, the Darlings return to Mayberry to help Charlene find a young boy to become engaged to her new baby.

     Maggie Peterson, Actress on ‘The Andy Griffith Show,’ Dies at 81
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Maggie Peterson, the singer and actress known for her recurring role on The Andy Griffith Show as Charlene Darling, the only daughter of a bluegrass-loving mountain family, has died.
Peterson died Sunday in Colorado, her family announced.
Peterson had auditioned to play a love interest for Griffith’s Sheriff Andy Taylor, but the role went to Elinor Donahue.
Her Charlene had a big crush on Andy, and after she married Dud Wash (Hoke Howell), she wound up naming her daughter, Andelina, after him.
In 1964, Peterson joined NBC’s The Bill Dana Show — which like The Andy Griffith Show was a spinoff from Danny Thomas’ Make Room for Daddy — as Susie the coffee shop waitress for that sitcom’s second and final season.
