     After Reviews Call Out 'Grooming' In The Time Traveler's Wife, Writer Steven Moffat Responds To The Criticism
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That's because Steven Moffat and HBO's The Time Traveler's Wife , based on the popular book by Audrey Niffenegger, has just premiered.
Steven Moffat is no stranger to science fiction-based romances, having helped create the fan-favorite relationship between Doctor Who’s The Doctor and Rose Tyler.
His take on Henry and Clare’s time traveling love story in The Time Traveler’s Wife is something some viewers may marvel at in the same way.
Someone may still mention one thing, though: Would Clare still love Henry if she wasn’t so acquainted with him during her childhood?
Though only time will tell how his take on The Time Traveler's Wife (and the responses to it) will continue to play out.

     The Time Traveler’s Wife review – far too much ick factor to be truly great
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alan Bennett once defined a classic as a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have.
For a modern bestseller, the formula needs rejigging only slightly – a book everyone feels they have read, even if they have gone out of their way to avoid it.
As such, most people know the basics of The Time Traveler’s Wife, Audrey Niffenegger’s debut that – aided by a 2009 film adaptation – has sold in its millions since it was published in 2003.
For me, I’m still trying to survive it.”At least the queasiness is tackled head-on … The Time Traveler's Wife.
The first is the ick factor occasioned by Henry’s many visits as a grown man to Clare as a child.

     Summary: This article contains spoilers for The Time Traveler's Wife episode 1.
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYThere's a sense in which The Time Traveler's Wife cannot really be considered a love story, however.
Related: The Time Traveler's Wife Cast, Character, &amp; Changes GuideIt's a fascinating concept, but there are actually some rather troubling implications.
Steven Moffat's The Time Traveler's Wife engages with these directly, albeit in a rather tongue-in-cheek fashion.
There is no freedom of choice, only destiny - as the dramatic ending of The Time Traveler's Wife episode 1 demonstrates.

     The Time Traveler’s Wife review: Steven Moffat’s adaptation lacks the power of the unexpected
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There must be something about Audrey Niffenegger’s 2003 novel, The Time Traveler’s Wife, that keeps people coming back for more.
There was, after all, a 2009 feature film adaptation, starring Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana, and now, popping up in 2022, an eight-part television adaptation.
Moffat’s taste leans distinctly towards the clean-cut and mainstream, and The Time Traveler’s Wife is inflected, throughout, with the sort of zippy, young adult pacing that has made hits of shows like Stranger Things and The Queen’s Gambit.
How much you enjoy this new iteration of The Time Traveler’s Wife will depend, I suspect, on your tolerance for a romantic and comedic palette of bright, unsubtle colours.
The Time Traveler’s Wife does not have the power of the unexpected.

     Summary: Young Clare was initially scared of the man who spoke from the bush, but soon he became her best friend.
After growing up and while working as an artist, she finally met Henry, a young Henry who had no idea who Clare was.
Even though Clare knew him, she knew an older Henry.
In her argument with young Henry, she threw her shoe, which fell on older Henry, who had just been transported at that time.
At the end of “The Time Traveler’s Wife,” Episode 1, after the two Henrys had a conversation, the young Henry heard a noise.

     Early Steven Moffat Doctor Who Episode Inspired By Time Traveler's Wife
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Time Traveler's Wife writer Steven Moffat reveals an early Doctor Who episode of his was actually based on the original novel by Audrey Niffenegger.
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYRelated: The Time Traveler’s Wife Must Avoid Steven Moffat's Story ProblemNow, in an interview with Radio Times, he reveals he was inspired by Niffenegger's novel when he wrote the Doctor Who episode "The Girl in the Fireplace."
It’s about a time-lapse relationship, and I did it quite consciously - knowing I was doing The Time Traveler’s Wife.
At which point I could be more obvious, so I made Doctor Who a wife - River Song.
While Moffat certainly has some high expectations placed on his adaptation of The Time Traveler's Wife, after all these years of being inspired by the material, perhaps no one's expectations are higher than his own.
