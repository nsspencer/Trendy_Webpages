     Great Replacement Theory? Try language of death wielded by opportunistic right-wing figures

     Summary: If you want to know part of what inspired the racist shooting spree at a Buffalo grocery store, you need to start listening.
To Fox News.
What you'll hear isn't subtle.
It comes from popular figures like Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, from Republican governors in states along the southern border and even from Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the No.
3 House Republican.

     Scrutiny of Republicans who embrace ‘great replacement theory’ after Buffalo massacre
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The massacre by a white supremacist gunman of Black shoppers at a Buffalo grocery store has drawn renewed scrutiny of Republican figures in the US who have embraced the racist “great replacement theory” he is alleged to have used as justification for the murders.
“Did you know: @EliseStefanik pushes white replacement theory?
In a study of the history of great replacement theory in Republican circles, Vice notes that it “isn’t new to American politicians”.
In 2017, the Iowa congressman Steve King, a fierce Trump loyalist, said in a tweet: “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.”Arguably the biggest rightwing apologist for great replacement theory, however, is Carlson, the Fox News host.
Buffalo was not the first time a mass shooter with white supremacist motivations had cited great replacement theory.

     What is ‘Great Replacement Theory?’ Tucker Carlson, Elise Stefanik scrutinized after Buffalo shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ideas from “The Great Replacement Theory” filled a racist manifesto supposedly posted online by Payton Gendron, the white 18-year-old man accused of targeting Black people in Saturday’s rampage.
WHAT IS THE GREAT REPLACEMENT THEORY?
In the U.S., you can point to efforts to intimidate and discourage Black people from voting — from replacing white voters at the polls — that date to the post-Civil War era.
On a regular basis, many adherents to the more extreme versions of The Great Replacement Theory converse through encrypted apps online and tend to be careful.
“It actually introduces the Great Replacement Theory to a conservative audience in an easier-to-swallow pill,” he said.

     Rep. Elise Stefanik Flamed For Pushing Racist Theory Embraced By Accused Buffalo Shooter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Right-wing Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) was denounced by her local newspaper for touting the racist “great replacement theory” just months before an accused mass killer used it to justify a racist massacre in Stefanik’s state.
“How low, Ms. Stefanik?” the editorial in the Albany Times Union asked in September.
AdvertisementPayton Gedron, the accused Buffalo supermarket shooter, repeatedly cited the theory in an online treatise before allegedly shooting 13 people, killing 10 — most of them Black.
AdvertisementStefanik’s senior adviser Alex deGrasse told the Times Union Sunday that the lawmaker has never supported replacement theory — or racism.
Stefanik was roundly attacked last week for blaming mysterious “pedo grifters” for somehow causing the shortage of infant formula in the U.S.

     How Elise Stefanik, Tucker Carlson and J.D. Vance sanitize 'great replacement theory' - The Washington Post
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So it is that the New York lawmaker is lashing out at critics who have noted her flirtation with “great replacement theory” in the wake of the horrific racist shooting in her home state.
Because in this episode we see how Republicans like Stefanik launder and sanitize these ideas in ways that insinuate them ever deeper into mainstream discourse.
Follow Greg Sargent 's opinions Follow AddThe extent to which “great replacement” ideas have migrated from the fringe into something more routine among Republican lawmakers appears new.
Case in point: A speaker floats “great replacement” ideas — then claims it is intended as racially neutral.
So when Stefanik declares herself shocked, shocked that anyone would suggest that nefarious intentions undergird her “great replacement” parroting, remember: This is a key feature of how the whole sordid game is supposed to work.

I don’t know why or how, but Vance became not a voice for the voiceless but an echo of the loudmouth.
This harsh personal judgement might well be true of both Stefanik and Vance.

     Stefanik's office slams 'shameless smears' she pushed replacement theory 'motivating' Buffalo gunman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elise Stefanik defended herself against smears claiming she is somehow responsible for allegedly stoking the 'great replacement' conspiracy theory that was cited in the Buffalo mass shooter's 180-page manifesto.
Stefanik and other Republican lawmakers have previously come under fire for echoing the 'great replacement' theory, a conspiracy that politicians are attempting to wipe out white Americans by 'replacing' them with immigrants.
The shooter's 180-page manifesto made references to the 'great replacement' theory as he spewed racist and anti-Semitic sentiments.
Stefanik and other criticized conservative lawmakers have not pushed the 'great replacement' conspiracy theory by name, but have been accused of echoing the tenants as part of a supposed anti-immigrant rhetoric.
