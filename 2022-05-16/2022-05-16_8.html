     Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 83 of the invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The evacuation of wounded Ukrainian troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol is under way, Volodomyr Zelenskiy confirmed, with more than 260 fighters transported out of the plant.
Western military sources say that Vladimir Putin is involved in the war in Ukraine “at the level of a colonel or brigadier”.
Ukrainian officials claimed that Ukrainian troops in the country’s north-east had pushed back Russian forces from the city of Kharkiv and advanced as far as the border with Russia.
Ukrainian forces in the east of the country could be slowed by Russia’s ally Belarus, which is mobilising special forces along Ukraine’s northern border, British intelligence has warned.
Russian forces have shelled frontline positions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas area as fighting becomes increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war.

     Russia-Ukraine war: What happened today (May 16)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reuters reported buses carried Ukrainian fighters out of Mariupol and cited a witness as seeing evacuees arrive in Novoazovsk, an area controlled by Russia-backed separatists.
The Ukrainian military previously said Russian troops were pulling back from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and the war was entering a new, long-term phase.
The fast-food giant had previously paused its operations in the country days after Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February.
The folk-rap group ended their performance with a plea to help Ukraine, Mariupol and Azovstal.
Then came the Ukraine war.

Refugees from Mariupol reached Ukrainian-controlled Zaporizhzhia in a large convoy of cars and vans after waiting days for the Russian military to allow them leave.
Russian forces hit Ukrainian military command posts, ammunition depots, and other military equipment, killing at least 100 Ukrainian “nationalists”, Moscow’s defence ministry said.
Russia’s war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned, and “Ukraine can win this war”, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.

     Russia-Ukraine war live updates Ukraine ends Mariupol fight; some Azovstal troops taken to Russian-held areas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A retired Russian colonel told state media on Monday that the invasion of Ukraine is not going the way Russia is portraying it, and that the global isolation facing the country is more daunting than Russian leaders are letting on.
“And it’s that situation that we need to get out of.”In an extremely rare moment of candour on Russian state TV today, defence columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok gave a damning assessment of Russia's war in Ukraine and his country's international isolation.
It's fairly long but worth your time so I've added subtitles.
As state media host Olga Skabeyeva pushed back on Khodaryonok and said that the Ukrainian forces are “not such a great contingent,” the retired colonel replied that the will of Ukraine mattered more than whether they are “professional” soldiers.
Then, as Skabeyeva attempted to equate Ukrainian forces’ “desire to die” to professionalism, Khodaryonok shot down the state media host’s assertion, saying “it’s a component of an army’s high combat readiness.”

     Summary: And Ukraine made a symbolic gain when its forces reportedly pushed Russian troops back to the Russian border in the Kharkiv region.
Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said 53 seriously wounded fighters were taken from the Azovstal plant to a hospital in Novoazovsk, east of Mariupol.
After nightfall Monday, several buses pulled away from the steel mill accompanied by Russian military vehicles.
But it is impossible to unblock Azovstal by military means.”The Ukrainian General Staff also said on Facebook that the Mariupol garrison has completed its mission.
Zelenskyy thanked the soldiers who reportedly pushed them all the way to the Russian border in the Kharkiv region.

This episode set the tone for Russian air operations that have fallen far short of expectations.
Russia has far more war planes, and far more modern aircraft, than Ukraine.
Why isn't this translating to a Russian military advantage over time?
Yet from the start, Russian war planes and helicopters have been getting shot out of the sky.

     Summary: By any measure, despite capturing territory in the south and east, the Russian military has suffered a major blow in Ukraine.
The number of troops participating was probably half the number advertised, military analysts said.
Image This photo released by the Russian military shows Russian pilots with a Sukhoi Su-34 strike fighter, in 2015, in Latakia, Syria.
And that is only the public portion of Russia’s military budget.
The war in Ukraine exposed the fact that the Russian military is “not 10 feet tall, but they are not two feet tall, either,” he said.
