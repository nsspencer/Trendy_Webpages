     Rob Gronkowski drops major hint as to his plans for 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Tom Brady announced that he is returning to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the 2022 season, most believed that it would not be too long before Brady’s partner in crime, Rob Gronkowski, made the same announcement.
But, here we stand on May 16th and Gronkowski has yet to make an official announcement about his plans for 2022.
“I’ll represent a 7 jersey in the stands for ya,” Gronk responded.
Embed from Getty ImagesThat response could be a major hint as to what Gronkowski decides to do in 2022 and it sure does sound like he will be watching from the stands, rather than suiting up for the Buccaneers.
Here is the exchange:Nation, do you think Gronkowski will hang up his cleats, or do you think he will be back with the Buccaneers for the 2022 season?

     Summary: And that is exactly what it seems like Gronk’s former division rival in Drew Brees is doing.
I’ll let you know — Drew Brees (@drewbrees) May 15, 2022Yeah, right.
Jameis Winston might be coming off an injury, but at least he can actually get the ball down the field.
What would Brees look like as a passer after a full year out of the league and with that shoulder?
That is not the type of player that would help the Saints remotely in the current stage of their franchise, but it would sure help the Buccaneers.

“I don’t think Edelman is his go or stop factor.
Rob did it in 2019 and came back and won a Super Bowl, so Julian could very well come back.
“There’s nothing that you guys don’t know, that I don’t know,” she said.
“I don’t think you need that advice because everything you do in this world, on the field and off the field, you crush it, so I don’t think he needs my advice.
