     How Elise Stefanik, Tucker Carlson and J.D. Vance sanitize 'great replacement theory' - The Washington Post
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So it is that the New York lawmaker is lashing out at critics who have noted her flirtation with “great replacement theory” in the wake of the horrific racist shooting in her home state.
Because in this episode we see how Republicans like Stefanik launder and sanitize these ideas in ways that insinuate them ever deeper into mainstream discourse.
Follow Greg Sargent 's opinions Follow AddThe extent to which “great replacement” ideas have migrated from the fringe into something more routine among Republican lawmakers appears new.
Case in point: A speaker floats “great replacement” ideas — then claims it is intended as racially neutral.
So when Stefanik declares herself shocked, shocked that anyone would suggest that nefarious intentions undergird her “great replacement” parroting, remember: This is a key feature of how the whole sordid game is supposed to work.

     High-Ranking Republican Pushes ‘Great Replacement’ Rhetoric Two Days After White Supremacist Mass Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The mass shooting in Buffalo on Saturday was inspired by the great replacement, but that didn’t keep Stefanik from continuing to push the idea that Democrats are trying to replace white people with people of color.
“Democrats desperately want wide open borders and mass amnesty for illegals allowing them to vote,” she wrote on Monday morning.
Carlson has also repeatedly pushed the idea that Americans should take action in response to the “great replacement,” as Media Matters pointed out on Monday.
The “great replacement” conspiracy was rampant throughout his 180-page manifesto.
Stefanik isn’t the only politician or aspiring politician who pushed the political version of the great replacement theory in the wake of Saturday’s shooting.

I don’t know why or how, but Vance became not a voice for the voiceless but an echo of the loudmouth.
This harsh personal judgement might well be true of both Stefanik and Vance.

     Summary: Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) has emerged as a rising force within the House Republican Conference a year after taking over as conference chair amid the turmoil surrounding Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.)
That’s far from the case with the 37-year-old Stefanik, and a big reason why she’s seen as a rising GOP star.
“It has been a step up.”Members are happy that the House GOP no longer has its top messenger publicly criticizing Trump.
As chair, Stefanik shifted the conference’s internal messaging strategy to send more rapid response emails on GOP messaging guidance to members about breaking news events.
That is no longer the case.”On top of becoming conference chair, Stefanik took on another new title in the last year: mom.
