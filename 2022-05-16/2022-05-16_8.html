     Ukraine says more than 260 soldiers evacuated from Mariupol; Sweden and Finland move to join NATO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday that "Ukraine can win this war" following an informal meeting of the group.
His comments came after Finland announced it would apply to join the military alliance in what marks a historic move for the traditionally neutral Nordic country.
Joining the military alliance will "maximize" Finland's security after Russia's unprecedented invasion of Ukraine in February, President Sauli Niinisto said.
Sweden is expected to follow suit, with both applications likely to enflame tensions between NATO and Russia further.
Moscow warned last week of "retaliatory steps" if Finland joined the alliance.

     Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 83 of the invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The evacuation of wounded Ukrainian troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol is under way, Volodomyr Zelenskiy confirmed, with more than 260 fighters transported out of the plant.
Western military sources say that Vladimir Putin is involved in the war in Ukraine “at the level of a colonel or brigadier”.
Ukrainian officials claimed that Ukrainian troops in the country’s north-east had pushed back Russian forces from the city of Kharkiv and advanced as far as the border with Russia.
Ukrainian forces in the east of the country could be slowed by Russia’s ally Belarus, which is mobilising special forces along Ukraine’s northern border, British intelligence has warned.
Russian forces have shelled frontline positions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas area as fighting becomes increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war.

     Russia-Ukraine war: What happened today (May 16)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reuters reported buses carried Ukrainian fighters out of Mariupol and cited a witness as seeing evacuees arrive in Novoazovsk, an area controlled by Russia-backed separatists.
The Ukrainian military previously said Russian troops were pulling back from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and the war was entering a new, long-term phase.
The fast-food giant had previously paused its operations in the country days after Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February.
The folk-rap group ended their performance with a plea to help Ukraine, Mariupol and Azovstal.
Then came the Ukraine war.

"As for the expansion of NATO, including through new members of the alliance which are Finland, Sweden — Russia has no problems with these states.
According to the Russian leader, the NATO expansion is "artificial" as the alliance goes beyond its geographic purpose and is influencing other regions "not in the best way."
According to Putin, the leaders of the CSTO member countries on Monday will adopt a joint statement on military cooperation.
The statement further added, "Sweden's entry into NATO will cause significant damage to the security of Northern Europe and the European continent as a whole."
