     Ukraine can win this war, NATO chief says; Finland and Sweden move to join military alliance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday that "Ukraine can win this war" following an informal meeting of the group.
His comments came after Finland announced it would apply to join the military alliance in what marks a historic move for the traditionally neutral Nordic country.
Joining the military alliance will "maximize" Finland's security after Russia's unprecedented invasion of Ukraine in February, President Sauli Niinisto said.
Sweden is expected to follow suit with both applications likely to enflame tensions between NATO and Russia further.
Moscow warned last week of "retaliatory steps" if Finland joined the alliance.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works in the southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine, on May 15.
(Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters)The Russian Defense Ministry says the evacuation of wounded Ukrainian forces from the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol has begun.
Russian network RT has shown video of about 10 to 12 buses leaving the plant.
The buses appear to be a mixture of hospital and ordinary transport — some are marked with a red cross.
Media outlets in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic showed at least one wounded fighter on a stretcher arriving at a hospital in the region late Monday.

But Ukrainian troops also advanced as Russian forces pulled back from around the northeastern city of Kharkiv in recent days.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked his forces who reportedly pushed all the way to the Russian border in the Kharkiv region in a symbolic gain.
Russia has been plagued by setbacks in the war, most glaringly in its failure early on to take the capital of Kyiv.

     Ukraine Live Updates: Setbacks in East Force Russia to Scale Back Ambitions
    </h2>

     Summary: That was the Russian military more than a decade ago when the country invaded Georgia, according to the defense minister at the time.
By any measure, despite capturing territory in the south and east, the Russian military has suffered a major blow in Ukraine.
The number of troops participating was probably half the number advertised, military analysts said.

And that is only the public portion of Russia’s military budget.
