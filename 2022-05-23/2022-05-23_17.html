     GOP Gov. Kemp fires back after Stacey Abrams calls Georgia ‘worst state’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams briefly forgot the first lesson of Politics 101 over the weekend: Never criticize the place you’re running in.
Abrams, making her second bid for the Georgia governor’s mansion, trashed the Peach State to her fellow Democrats as the “worst state in the country to live” during a Saturday night dinner in Gwinnett County, hitting Republicans over their favored slogan.
“I am tired of hearing about being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live​,” said Abrams, who acknowledged immediately after voicing the sentiment that attacks were likely to start coming in hot.

     White Republican David Perdue Says Stacey Abrams Is ‘Demeaning Her Own Race’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The ousted senator from Georgia currently running for the Republican Party’s nomination for governor is trailing incumbent Brian Kemp badly heading into Tuesday’s primary.
He’s already eyeing a potential showdown with Democrat Stacey Abrams, however, and on Monday he tried to argue that he, not Abrams, knows what’s best for Black Georgians.
“When she told Black farmers you don’t need to be on the farm, when she told Black workers in hospitality and all this you don’t need to be … she is demeaning her own race when it comes to that,” Perdue said during a radio appearance.
Abrams has since worked tirelessly to ensure voting rights for marginalized Georgians, an effort that helped turn the state blue in 2020.
Abrams is making another run at the Governor’s Mansion this year and, having already secured the Democratic nomination, will square off against Kemp or Perdue this fall.

     Stacey Abrams' playbook faces a new test in second run for Georgia governor

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) When Stacey Abrams acknowledged defeat to Republican Brian Kemp in her 2018 campaign for governor of Georgia, she refused to call it a "concession."
"We have to remember, voter suppression isn't about stopping every voter," Abrams said.
Democratic groups and Abrams' campaign know it, and believe they are better equipped -- and funded -- to enact the intensive groundwork that was a hallmark of her first run for governor.
And we have been more intentional about reaching out to that demographic, not just New Georgia Project, but others in the progressive ecosystem," said Kendra Cotton, chief operating officer for New Georgia Project and its affiliated New Georgia Project Action Fund.
