     Ukrainian Intelligence: Putin Survived Assassination Attempt Early in Conflict
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly survived an assassination attempt, according to Ukrainian Intelligence.
Details are minimal, but officials say it happened two months ago during the start of Russia's brutal invasion of its neighbor.
It includes $20 billion for military assistance and is intended to support Ukraine through September.
A new video is said to show a strike on a Russian missile launcher.
As the war with Russia drags on, the country's inability to export millions of tons of grain has sent global food prices soaring.

     Vladimir Putin assassination attempt would have been ‘hugely complex operation’, Western officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Western officials have cast doubts over claims Vladimir Putin was the subject of a recent assassination attempt, citing the increasingly small circle of contacts the Russian leader allows around him.
Western sources have been unable to verify the claims, but said any such attempt on the Russian leader’s life would be challenging.
“President Putin is operating – and has done through Covid and in an enduring basis – in a smaller and smaller grouping.
So were anyone to attempt to do something like that it would be a hugely complex operation,” the official said.
Absolutely unsuccessful attempt, but it really took place… It was about two months ago.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Claims by a Ukrainian official about an assassination attempt on Russian President Vladimir Putin have raised eyebrows.
Budanov told Ukrainska Pravda “There was an attempt to assassinate Putin… He was even attacked, it is said, by representatives of the Caucasus, not so long ago.
The claim by Budanov is being seen as the sixth time Putin has faced a assassination attempt.
A 2017 interview of Putin by Oliver Stone claimed Putin had faced five assassination attempts.
He faced a similar assassination attempt on the day of the 2008 Russian presidential election, with a Tajik sniper arrested hours before Putin was due to give a speech in Red Square in Moscow.
