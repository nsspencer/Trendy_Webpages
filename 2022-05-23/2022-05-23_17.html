     Map: Countries with confirmed monkeypox cases in the 2022 outbreak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At least 160 confirmed cases of monkeypox have been reported this month in non-African countries, according to Global.health, a group that gathers infectious disease data.
Four times as many countries outside of Africa have reported monkeypox this month than have in the previous 50 years.
But the DRC and Nigeria have both seen a rise in monkeypox cases.
The DRC reported more than 18,000 confirmed or suspected monkeypox cases from 2010 to 2019, up from about 10,000 from 2000 to 2009, and more than 6,000 suspected cases in 2020.
Nigeria has reported more than 200 confirmed cases since 2017 and more than 500 suspected ones, according to the WHO.

     Monkeypox in Utah: Officials report 2 suspected cases in Salt Lake County
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Chris Samuels | The Salt Lake Tribune) Dr. Angela Dunn, executive director of the Salt Lake County Health Department, speaks about two suspected cases of monkeypox identified in Salt Lake County during a news conference on Monday, May 23, 2022.
Two adults in the same Salt Lake County household are suspected to have monkeypox based on preliminary testing, Salt Lake County Health Department officials announced Monday morning.
Salt Lake County health officials also said there is no evidence to indicate that the two presumably infected people infected anyone outside of Salt Lake County.
The Utah Department of Health referred requests for comment to the Salt Lake County Health Department.

     A Monkeypox Vaccine Was Approved By The FDA In 2019. Here’s What To Know About It As The Virus Spreads.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The CDC suggests people who are eligible receive the monkeypox vaccine within four days of exposure to prevent the development of disease, but sooner is better.
There are no medications developed specifically to fight monkeypox virus, but there are three treatments — cidofovir, ST-246, and vaccinia immune globulin — that can be used to treat it in emergency scenarios.
The agency said a request to release doses of the Jynneos vaccine from the national stockpile is "actively happening."
Bavarian Nordic, the biotech company that developed Jynneos, said last week that the US purchased $119 million worth of its monkeypox vaccine in freeze-dried form.
But as a physician, he said, he would still need approval from the FDA before writing a prescription for the Jynneos vaccine to treat a patient with monkeypox at this time.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So far, scientists have recorded more than 250 confirmed or suspected monkeypox cases, mainly in Europe, and are trying to determine if and how the cases might be connected.
CLOSER LOOK: Reports of rare monkeypox cases around the world raise concernThe CDC is concerned about the pace cases are developing worldwide and wants to raise awareness about possible symptoms without encouraging people to cancel events.
All of the current cases are mild and appear to be going away on their own, she said.
A person with an immunocompromising or skin condition is likely to take longer to bring a monkeypox infection under control, Brooks said.
Vaccines and treatmentsThe United States has stockpiles of vaccines to prevent smallpox, which should also be effective against monkeypox, McQuiston said.

The pair saw their health care provider on Friday, who “immediately told them to isolate and called public health,” Dunn said.
The county health department did not release any additional information about the suspected cases, citing medical privacy laws.
“We are respecting the role Salt Lake County Health Department has as the lead agency on this response and will be referring comments to their agency at this time.
We are working closely with their team on the response,” state health department spokeswoman Jenny Johnson said.

     Monkeypox Cases on the Rise: What to Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brook Mitchell/Getty Images Dozens of monkeypox cases have been reported in multiple countries in Europe, and the outbreak has since spread to North America and Australia.
The WHO says scientists have identified several animals as susceptible to the monkeypox virus, including rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, non-human primates, and other species.
As of May 21, the organization reported 92 laboratory-confirmed cases and 28 suspected cases of monkeypox from 12 Member States not endemic to the monkeypox virus, with no deaths yet reported.
“Uncertainty remains on the natural history of monkeypox virus, and further studies are needed to identify the exact reservoir(s) and how virus circulation is maintained in nature,” said the WHO .
Newman said most monkeypox cases resolve over time.
