"As a board we will work hard with Jesse Marsch this summer to improve the squad and find a way to deliver the kind of performances you all deserve.

JOB DONE - Jesse Marsch has ticked off his first Leeds United brief and kept them in the Premier League.
It's frankly ridiculous that they don't like to hear an American accent in their sport, in their country, it's horrible.
According to Marsch he mainly keeps abreast of what is being written about Leeds so he can address any potential negativity surrounding individuals in his squad.
"The guys that have played here or are from England know what the media is like and don't pay much attention to it either."
