     Kalvin Phillips says Leeds have an ‘unbelievable’ star that ‘has had critics’ recently

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kalvin Phillips has told Leeds United’s YouTube channel that Raphinha has been “unbelievable” since he “came through the doors at Elland Road.
It is likely that the Brazil international will now leave Elland Road, after his two years at the club.
Speaking after his boyhood club survived and secured a third successive Premier League season, Phillips raved about Raphinha.
He branded him “unbelievable” and that any critics of him recently have been wrong.
While he probably deserves a big-money move to a Barcelona or another huge club, could he now stay at Elland Road?

     Summary: Phil Hay has revealed that Leeds United are working on a deal for an unnamed Premier League striker after securing their top-flight status for a third season.
Leeds beat Brentford 2-1 yesterday which, combined with Burnley’s loss to Newcastle United, secured their place in the Premier League for 2022/23.
Additionally, Leeds are said to be working on a deal for a Premier League striker, although there’s no name provided in the report.
“Patrick Bamford’s injury problems this season have hampered Leeds, with the striker managing only 560 minutes of Premier League football.
Quiz: Has Patrick Bamford scored more or less Leeds United goals than these 15 former players?

     Summary: Julien Laurens speaks about how Leeds avoided relegation on the final day of the Premier League season.
(1:34)Leeds United owner Andrea Radrizzani has pledged to work with manager Jesse Marsch on improving the squad for next season after they narrowly avoided relegation on the last day of the Premier League campaign.
American coach Jesse Marsch replaced Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds in March and ensured their survival in the Premier League.
Craig Mercer/MB Media/Getty Images"Staying in the Premier League was our objective this year and we've managed to obtain our top-flight status, but this is not success and improvements are needed," Radrizzani added.
"As a board we will work hard with Jesse Marsch this summer to improve the squad and find a way to deliver the kind of performances you all deserve.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But, amid the euphoria of avoiding relegation from the Premier League, Leeds United midfielder Raphinha was seen travelling the length of the Brentford pitch on his knees.
After the final whistle, the Leeds players celebrated wildly with their supporters in the corner of the Brentford Community stadium having secured their top flight status for another year.
Raphinha, who scored the opening goal of Leeds' win, couldn't contain his jubilation –jumping into the crowd to join the revelry.
Raphinha later posted about the achievement of surviving in the Premier League: "It was difficult, it was very difficult, but we fought hard and we achieved our goal of keeping this great club in the Premier League."
It will always be us and we are staying in the Premier League, gents."

     Summary: Those that questioned Raphinha’s commitment to the Leeds United cause in recent months were shut down emphatically at the Brentford Community Stadium.
Although, there will still be some hope that a new contract might be tempting for the wideman with Premier League status secure.
Whatever he chooses to do this summer, there shouldn’t – and won’t – be any animosity aimed towards Raphinha from Leeds fans.
He has also - more importantly - ensured that should he depart, he leaves the club as a true modern Leeds United icon.

     Summary: Sign up to our Leeds United newsletter Sign up Thanks for signing up!
JOB DONE - Jesse Marsch has ticked off his first Leeds United brief and kept them in the Premier League.
It's frankly ridiculous that they don't like to hear an American accent in their sport, in their country, it's horrible.
According to Marsch he mainly keeps abreast of what is being written about Leeds so he can address any potential negativity surrounding individuals in his squad.
"The guys that have played here or are from England know what the media is like and don't pay much attention to it either."
