     Monkeypox outbreak is primarily spreading through sex, WHO officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pavlo Gonchar | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesAn outbreak of the monkeypox virus in North America and Europe is primarily spreading through sex among men with about 200 confirmed and suspected cases across at least a dozen countries, World Health Organization officials said Monday.
European nations have confirmed dozens of cases in what's become the largest outbreak of monkeypox ever on the Continent, according to the German military.
You could get a cough or a cold through sexual contact, but it doesn't mean that it's a sexually transmitted disease," said Andy Seale, who advises the WHO on HIV, hepatitis and other sexually transmitted infections.
The virus is spread through close contact with people, animals or material infected with the virus.
He said to expect more confirmed cases in the U.S. in the coming weeks as doctors and public health officials reevaluate patients who have presented with symptoms and the virus continues to spread.

     Presumptive Case of Monkeypox Virus in King County – PUBLIC HEALTH INSIDER

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County, with support from Washington State Department of Health, is investigating a presumptive case of monkeypox virus infection reported to Public Health yesterday.
The case is in an adult male with international travel in the past month to a country that has also reported monkeypox cases recently.
Initial testing confirming an orthopoxviral infection was completed on Monday, May 23, 2022, at the Washington State Public Health Laboratory.
“The public and healthcare providers should be aware of the growing international monkeypox outbreak,” said Dr. Jeff Duchin, Health Officer for Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County.
In King County, symptomatic patients can be evaluated in the Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County Sexual Health Clinic, open M/W/TH/F 7:30 am – 6:00 pm and Tuesday 9:30 am – 6:00 pm.

     Monkeypox virus disease outbreak: New cases 'only tip of iceberg' but no urgent need for mass vaccinations, says WHO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "The primary measures to control the (monkeypox) outbreak are contact tracing and isolation," Reuters quoted Richard Pebody, who leads the high-threat pathogen team at WHO Europe, as saying.
While the US has said that it is in the process of releasing some Jynneos vaccine doses for use in monkeypox cases, Germany has said that it is assessing options for vaccinations.
There is no evidence that the monkeypox virus has mutated, Reuters reported citing another senior official at WHO.
It, however, is unclear what is driving the monkeypox disease outbreak, with scientists trying to understand the origin of the cases and whether anything about the virus has changed.
The monkeypox disease is transmitted through lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets, and contaminated materials such as bedding.

     Monkeypox likely spread through sex at 2 raves in Europe, expert suggests - National
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “We know monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected, and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission,” said Heymann.
To date, WHO has recorded more than 90 cases of monkeypox in a dozen countries including Britain, Spain, Israel, France, Switzerland, the U.S., Australia and Canada.
It can be spread through close contact with an infected person or their clothing or bedsheets, but sexual transmission has not yet been documented.
The agency’s Europe director warned that as summer begins across the continent, mass gatherings, festivals and parties could accelerate the spread of monkeypox.
Story continues below advertisementOther scientists have pointed out that it will be difficult to disentangle whether it is sex itself or the close contact related to sex that has driven the recent spread of monkeypox across Europe.
