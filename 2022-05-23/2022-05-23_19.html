     Will Aaron Judge Hit 60 Home Runs This Season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Judge bet on himself, and it appears he is ready to cash in — if he can stay healthy.
After going deep twice in a loss on Monday to Baltimore, Judge, 30, the Yankees’ right fielder, had a major-league-leading 17 home runs.
Those years should sound familiar: They are the eight seasons in which a player has hit 60 or more home runs.
“It’s really special,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said Monday.
He’s a really special player and obviously really carrying us offensively.”

     Summary: NEW YORK — Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge didn’t like the comment teammate Josh Donaldson made to White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson that led to benches clearing and an eventual suspension for Donaldson.
Judge said that Donaldson shouldn’t have invoked Robinson’s name, and that Donaldson should have taken the moment into context.
“Especially given their history and especially the series in Chicago,” Judge said.
While Judge said he didn’t think saying “Jackie” to Anderson was the “right move at all,” he added that he was appreciative that Donaldson admitted the mistake.
I don’t think it warranted a suspension, but, I certainly respect their process, and I know J.D.

     Aaron Judge Criticizes Josh Donaldson Over 'Jackie' Comment to Tim Anderson
    </h2>

     Summary: NEW YORK — Aaron Judge weighed in on Josh Donaldson's controversial comments for the first time on Monday night, candidly criticizing his teammate for what he said to White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson.
Donaldson called Anderson "Jackie" on Saturday, claiming his reference was a joke traced back to an interview the shortstop did in 2019, telling Sports Illustrated that he feels like today's Jackie Robinson.
Anderson, along with his teammates and coaches, have denounced Donaldson's comments over the last several days, condemning what the third baseman said.
Yankees manager Aaron Boone was also blunt in recent days about what Donaldson said, something the slugger has since apologized for.
That said, the skipper explained that he does not think Donaldson should received a suspension.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Donaldson of the Yankees recently earned a one-game suspension for referring to Tim Anderson of the White Sox as "Jackie" during a recent game between the two teams.
Donaldson's comment precipitated a near-brawl between the two teams, and afterward Chicago manager Tony La Russa referred to Donaldson's choice of words -- a reference to Jackie Robinson, who broke MLB's color line in 1947 -- as "racist."
In announcing the suspension of Donaldson, Michael Hill, MLB's senior vice president for on-field operations, characterized Donaldson's comment as "disrespectful and in poor judgment."
For his part, Donaldson's teammate Aaron Judge also took exception with the "Jackie" comment, albeit in somewhat less direct terms.
According to ESPN's 2017 MLB race and gender report card, white players comprise 57.5 percent of MLB rosters as opposed to 7.7 percent for African-American or Afro-Canadian players.
