     Rappers Young Thug, Gunna remain jailed in racketeering case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rappers Young Thug and Gunna remain jailed on racketeering charges in Atlanta following a court hearing in the wide-ranging gang caseATLANTA -- Rappers Young Thug and Gunna remained jailed on racketeering charges Monday in Atlanta following a court hearing in a case in which prosecutors have accused them of being members of a violent street gang that committed multiple murders, shootings and carjackings.
Fulton County prosecutors asked that he remain jailed, telling the judge some state witnesses have been threatened.
A bond hearing for Young Thug, whose given name is Jeffery Lamar Williams, was postponed until next month, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
Prosecutors say his attorney, Brian Steel, should be disqualified as Williams' lawyer because he represents others charged in the same case.
Young Thug co-wrote the hit “This is America” with Childish Gambino, making history when it became the first hip-hop track to win the song of the year Grammy in 2019.

     Summary: Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffrey Williams, did not enter a formal plea Monday.
A hearing to discuss the potential conflict and Williams’ bond request has been scheduled for June 2.
Lawyers for the rappers contend YSL, or Young Stoner Life, is simply a record label, not a street gang as prosecutors allege.
“The only way you get around that, as a district attorney, is to be able to link these things up specifically with specific details,” he said.
Similar to lyrics, James said social media posts need to have a connection as well.

     Gunna Denied Jail Release In Atlanta RICO Case Against YSL

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Georgia judge on Monday refused to release Gunna and Young Thug from jail following their indictment in a sweeping criminal case against alleged Atlanta gang members, denying pre-trial release to Gunna while deferring a decision on Young Thug.
Explore See latest videos, charts and news Gunna Young Thug See latest videos, charts and news“They are the ones directing the violence,” argued one prosecutor from the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office, referring to both Young Thug and Gunna.
Additional charges against Young Thug were later tacked on based on items found when he was arrested, including possession of illegal guns.
Ahead of Monday’s hearing, Young Thug’s lawyers argued that he was “innocent” and clearly deserving of pre-trial release from what they described as “dungeon-like conditions” in jail.
An attorney for Young Thug did not immediately return a request for comment on Monday.

     Gunna Denied Bond Due to Alleged Role in YSL Gang
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gunna was denied bond at a Monday hearing in Atlanta after prosecutors successfully argued he was in a “command position” in the alleged Young Slime Life gang, according to Fox 5 in Atlanta and Rolling Stone.
Also in court on Monday, the judge delayed a ruling on bond for Young Thug (real name Jeffrey Williams).
He was denied bond after his initial arrest, although his attorney is working to procure an emergency bond due to the “inhumane” conditions Williams is allegedly experiencing in jail.
Gunna and Young Thug (real name: Jeffrey Lamar Williams) were both arrested in Atlanta in 2017 on drug-possesion charges after a traffic stop.
Young Thug and Gunna are two of the fastest-rising rappers of recent years and are currently at the height of the careers.
