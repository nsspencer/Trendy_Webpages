     Putin survived an assassination attempt after he invaded, Ukrainian intelligence official says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There was an assassination attempt on Putin about two months ago, Ukrainian intelligence claims.
Email address By clicking ‘Sign up’, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyRussian President Vladimir Putin survived an assassination attempt launched not long after he invaded Ukraine, Ukraine's top military intelligence official said.
Kyrylo Budanov told the Ukrainian newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda that in March, "there was an attempt to assassinate Putin."
Because he referenced "representatives of the Caucasus," Budanov appeared to be saying that Ukraine was not behind the attack.
About the time of the claimed assassination attempt, there were already signs that the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine was faltering badly, with reverberations in the Kremlin.

     Vladimir Putin assassination attempt would have been ‘hugely complex operation’, Western officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Western officials have cast doubts over claims Vladimir Putin was the subject of a recent assassination attempt, citing the increasingly small circle of contacts the Russian leader allows around him.
Western sources have been unable to verify the claims, but said any such attempt on the Russian leader’s life would be challenging.
“President Putin is operating – and has done through Covid and in an enduring basis – in a smaller and smaller grouping.
So were anyone to attempt to do something like that it would be a hugely complex operation,” the official said.
Absolutely unsuccessful attempt, but it really took place… It was about two months ago.

     Ukraine Intel Chief Says Someone Tried to Assassinate Putin in March
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian Chief of Defense Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin survived an assassination attempt two months ago.
During an interview with the Ukrainian newspaper Ukrainska Pravda, Budanov said Putin was targeted for assassination while visiting the Caucasus in early March, shortly after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.
“There was an attempt to assassinate Putin,” Budanov said.
It should be noted that a low-level insurgency by Islamist activists continues in the Caucasus region.
Lost in the news of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was the fact that tensions were flaring again over the disputed region.
