     Walmart's Juneteenth 'Celebration' Ice Cream Draws Backlash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Welp, here's the latest entry to the Tone-Deaf Marketing Hall of Fame (there really should be one by now) ... Walmart's Juneteenth Ice Cream is MOA -- melting on arrival -- with critics, as one might expect.
As soon as the retail giant started putting the "Celebration Edition" on its freezer shelves ... the Twitter mob sounded off, calling the idea "garbage," and worse.
The pints contain swirled red velvet and cheesecake ice cream flavors ... and included the message, "Share and celebrate African-American culture, emancipation and enduring hope."
Walmart is also launching a similar "celebration edition" for Pride Month, which is also coming up in June.
That flavor is white chocolate ice cream with brownies and cherries.

     Summary: But we just got Juneteenth recognized as a national holiday last year, commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African-American people.
Walmart wasted no time before trying to profit off Black people’s supposed “freedom” with Great Value Brand’s Juneteenth ice cream flavor?
(They would give us the most off-brand ice cream to commodify our liberation.)
But the outrageous “Black liberation” ice cream roll out, isn’t the only Juneteenth product brands are cooking up.
AdvertisementOn the contrary, there are many Black-owned alternatives to white corporate brands, such as Blissfully Southern’s Cream-a-licious red velvet and cheesecake ice cream, Miiriya, Free to Be Black’s Juneteenth t-shirts, and the entire Black-owned Juneteenth section on Etsy.

     Summary: This past weekend, while some of the country was experiencing a serious heat wave, people were talking about ice cream, but not to help folks brave the rising temperatures.
On Twitter, many were sharing their confusion and disdain over a Juneteenth ice cream from Walmart.

I can see both sides of the coin: why a Walmart ice cream for Juneteenth would come off as tacky but also why the uproar over it could also be exhausting.
