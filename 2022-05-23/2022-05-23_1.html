     Summary: Fans of Jurassic World: Dominion (which is part of the 2022 movie releases) star Chris Pratt got a nice surprise from the actor and his wife, author Katherine Schwarzenegger, back in December when the couple announced that they were expecting their second child.
What Is The Name Of Chris Pratt And Katherine Schwarzenegger’s Second Child?
Proud new papa Chris Pratt took to his Instagram recently to share the news of the arrival of his second child with Katherine Schwarzenegger, and also announced the name that they’ve given their new baby girl:We are so excited to announce the birth of our second daughter, Eloise Christina Schwarzenegger Pratt.
Pratt shares son Jack, who’s now 9, with Faris, and he and Schwarzenegger welcomed their first daughter together, Lyla, in August of 2020.
This has led to some adorably creative mommy-and-me posts , usually where we only see bits of Schwarzenegger and Lyla wearing matching shoes or clothes.
