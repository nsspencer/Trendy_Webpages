     Zeus flicks too hard in latest Thor trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first full trailer for Thor: Love and Thunder has arrived, and somehow found a new angle on the journey of Chris Hemsworth’s titular hero.
So, who is holding the title of Mighty Thor, and what has Jane been doing for the last eight years, seven months, and six days?
We don’t know yet, but we do know that besides the return of the splashy color scheme that director Taika Waititi is carrying over from Thor: Ragnarok, there seems to be a Snyder Cut-ish black-and-white segment in-store as Gorr faces off with the MCU heroes.
Unsurprisingly, however, none of those elements are as consequential as a finger flick from Zeus (Russell Crowe) himself.
Expect to see all of the above, and, of course, Taika Waititi as Korg, when Thor: Love and Thunder hits theaters on July 8th, 2022.

     New Thor: Love and Thunder Synopsis Confirms Russell Crowe's Role
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was reported last year, after being spotted at a rugby match with other familiar actors, that Russell Crowe was cast in a minor role in Thor: Love and Thunder.
Marvel Studios had hoped to surprise fans with Crowe's role in the Ragnarok sequel, but that obviously didn't happen.
ADVERTISEMENTRussell Crowe Confirmed as ZeusMarvelAn official synopsis for Thor: Love and Thunder has been released that confirms Russell Crowe's role as Zeus:A new trailer and poster are now available for Marvel Studios’ “Thor: Love and Thunder,” revealing new details about the God of Thunder’s latest adventure—including a trek to Olympus where Zeus (Russell Crowe) reigns supreme.
ADVERTISEMENTIt likely means that Love and Thunder will delve into Gorr's tragic backstory and why he hates the gods.
Hopefully, fans will see Gorr's origin when Thor: Love and Thunder releases in theaters on July 8.
