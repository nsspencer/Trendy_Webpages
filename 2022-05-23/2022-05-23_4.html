     Elden Ring Mod Pits Every Demigod Against Each Other in a Battle Royale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An Elden Ring modder has orchestrated the ultimate Battle Royale, pitting each of the game's demigod bosses against one another.
YouTube user Garden of Eyes - who's previously modded legendary summon Let Me Solo Her into Elden Ring and pit Malenia against every other boss - uploaded a video of all six demigod bosses battling throughout a handful of different rounds with different rulesets.
A battle royale of the strongest Demigod.
Elden Ring has proved somewhat of a cultural phenomenon since it was release in February, with players finding a ton of different ways to interact with the game.

     Elden Ring getting full co-op multiplayer thanks to fan-made mod
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fan behind Sekiro’s co-op mod is also making one for Elden Ring and a public beta is coming very soon.
They’ve had previous experience creating mods for other FromSoftware games, including co-op and PvP modes for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
They also helped raised awareness of a serious PC exploit in FromSoftware’s games, including Elden Ring, and released an anti-cheat mod to help combat it.
As for official Elden Ring DLC, there hasn’t been any mention of it from FromSoftware.
Elden Ring is available for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

     Elden Ring Lets Players Use Enemies Against Each Other
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of the many wild and wonderful locations in FromSoftware’s 2022 RPG Elden Ring, Caelid is perhaps the most notorious.
In fact, a recent survey suggests that players find Caelid to be the most memorable Elden Ring location of all.
Adjacent to Limgrave, it can be accessed early on, though careless Tarnished who wander within its borders are likely to experience a brutal “welcome to Elden Ring” moment.
Useful as they are, Bewitching Branches aren’t particularly plentiful in Elden Ring, and players often forget about them entirely due to their scarcity.
Elden Ring is available now for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Audio player loading…Elden Ring may have once included a weapon and armor durability system, possibly similar to that used in the Dark Souls series.
Elden Ring doesn't include a weapon and armor durability system, with your gear remaining effective for as long as you have it.
(Image credit: Bandai Namco)Welcome changesMany FromSoftware fans were pleased to see weapon durability hadn’t made its way into Elden Ring.
It’s not surprising that FromSoftware retired the feature for Elden Ring.
While it had appeared in the first Dark Souls game and took on greater importance in Dark Souls 2, it all but vanished in Dark Souls 3.

     Summary: Watch on YouTube Could we get Elden Ring 2, even if we never got a Bloodborne 2?
That’s certainly true of Elden Ring, which – in many ways – is far more epic and grandiose than what has come before.
But there’s another, more notable tribute to Bloodborne in Elden Ring.
Elden Ring has been continually improved by... Patches.
The beauty of Elden Ring is that while intimidatingly vast there is always something fascinating to discover.

     ‘Elden Ring’ Is About To Get True Co-Op This Week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elden Ring FromSoftwareElden Ring is largely a solo experience, but like past FromSoftware games, does integrate multiplayer where you’re able to call in assistance in certain areas for tough battles, and it has PvP where you can battle other players through invasions.
It’s from LukeYui, a well-known FromSoft modder, and he’s been working on a true co-op mode for Elden Ring which will be out on Nexus Mods this Friday, May 27, for the PC version of the game.
Among the functionality the co-op mod has:Teaming up in combat anywhere in the game.
It’s unclear why despite having co-op elements, FromSoftware has never done full co-op in any of their games.
It reminds me of dying for co-op Skyrim back in the day, considering I’ve never enjoyed exploring an open world as much as I have Elden Ring’s, since Skyrim.

     Summary: This week we take a look at what the Elden Ring community is up to.
This week we decided to take a look at the community that has formed around Elden Ring.
One of the latest builds to come out of Elden Ring is one for The Witcher's Geralt of Rivia.
And just like The Witcher 3, Elden Ring also has bombs, potions, crossbows, and grease.
Thankfully one Elden Ring fan created a useful little family tree to make the lineage a bit clearer.
