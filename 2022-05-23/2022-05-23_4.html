     Walmart's Juneteenth 'Celebration' Ice Cream Draws Backlash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Welp, here's the latest entry to the Tone-Deaf Marketing Hall of Fame (there really should be one by now) ... Walmart's Juneteenth Ice Cream is MOA -- melting on arrival -- with critics, as one might expect.
As soon as the retail giant started putting the "Celebration Edition" on its freezer shelves ... the Twitter mob sounded off, calling the idea "garbage," and worse.
The pints contain swirled red velvet and cheesecake ice cream flavors ... and included the message, "Share and celebrate African-American culture, emancipation and enduring hope."
Walmart is also launching a similar "celebration edition" for Pride Month, which is also coming up in June.
That flavor is white chocolate ice cream with brownies and cherries.

     Toledo City Council to vote on replacing two paid holidays with Juneteenth, Indigenous Peoples Day for city workers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Council will vote Tuesday on whether to replace Good Friday with Juneteenth as a paid holiday for city workers and replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day.
TOLEDO, Ohio — Toledo City Council is expected to vote Tuesday on a pair of proposals to change city-observed holidays.
The first measure would make Juneteenth a paid holiday for city employees, replacing Good Friday as a day off.
But here in Toledo, city council members, including Cerssandra Mcpherson, want to make the holiday the official 16th paid holiday for city employees, replacing Good Friday.
Council also consider changing Columbus Day to Indigenous People's Day during Tuesday's meeting.

     'It's the Freedom for Me': Brands Have Already Ruined Juneteenth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But we just got Juneteenth recognized as a national holiday last year, commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African-American people.
Walmart wasted no time before trying to profit off Black people’s supposed “freedom” with Great Value Brand’s Juneteenth ice cream flavor?
(They would give us the most off-brand ice cream to commodify our liberation.)
3) Why when an ice cream is created to celebrate African American “liberation” does it have to be a Great Value Walmart brand?
AdvertisementOn the contrary, there are many Black-owned alternatives to white corporate brands, such as Blissfully Southern’s Cream-a-licious red velvet and cheesecake ice cream, Miiriya, Free to Be Black’s Juneteenth t-shirts, and the entire Black-owned Juneteenth section on Etsy.
