     Summary: The fan behind Sekiro’s co-op mod is also making one for Elden Ring and a public beta is coming very soon.
They’ve had previous experience creating mods for other FromSoftware games, including co-op and PvP modes for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
They also helped raised awareness of a serious PC exploit in FromSoftware’s games, including Elden Ring, and released an anti-cheat mod to help combat it.
As for official Elden Ring DLC, there hasn’t been any mention of it from FromSoftware.
Elden Ring is available for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

     Summary: Now that many Elden Ring players have finished their playthroughs, speedrunning has grown increasingly popular.
One new discovery could help these Elden Ring speedrunners, and it could help Elden Ring casual players, too.
Reddit user Opposite_Solution_38 shared a clip from Elden Ring this past week during which they discovered something strange.

     Summary: Audio player loading…Elden Ring may have once included a weapon and armor durability system, possibly similar to that used in the Dark Souls series.
Elden Ring doesn't include a weapon and armor durability system, with your gear remaining effective for as long as you have it.
(Image credit: Bandai Namco)Welcome changesMany FromSoftware fans were pleased to see weapon durability hadn’t made its way into Elden Ring.
It’s not surprising that FromSoftware retired the feature for Elden Ring.
While it had appeared in the first Dark Souls game and took on greater importance in Dark Souls 2, it all but vanished in Dark Souls 3.

     ‘Elden Ring’ Is About To Get True Co-Op This Week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elden Ring FromSoftwareElden Ring is largely a solo experience, but like past FromSoftware games, does integrate multiplayer where you’re able to call in assistance in certain areas for tough battles, and it has PvP where you can battle other players through invasions.
It’s from LukeYui, a well-known FromSoft modder, and he’s been working on a true co-op mode for Elden Ring which will be out on Nexus Mods this Friday, May 27, for the PC version of the game.
Among the functionality the co-op mod has:Teaming up in combat anywhere in the game.
It’s unclear why despite having co-op elements, FromSoftware has never done full co-op in any of their games.
It reminds me of dying for co-op Skyrim back in the day, considering I’ve never enjoyed exploring an open world as much as I have Elden Ring’s, since Skyrim.

     Summary: Watch on YouTube Could we get Elden Ring 2, even if we never got a Bloodborne 2?
That’s certainly true of Elden Ring, which – in many ways – is far more epic and grandiose than what has come before.
But there’s another, more notable tribute to Bloodborne in Elden Ring.
Elden Ring has been continually improved by... Patches.
The beauty of Elden Ring is that while intimidatingly vast there is always something fascinating to discover.
