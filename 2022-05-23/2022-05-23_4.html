     Leeds United Star Aware Of Interested Club’s Stance On Signing Him, Willing To Wait
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Raphinha is aware that Barcelona will only move to sign him from Leeds United if Ousmane Dembele leaves the Camp Nou and is willing to wait, according to Spanish sports daily Marca.
The winger has been heavily linked with a move away from Elland Road in the summer, with Spanish giants Barcelona keen on him.
And Barcelona will only move for the 25-year-old if their star Dembele leaves Camp Nou when his contract expires in June.
Xavi has made it clear to the Barcelona hierarchy that his priority is to keep Dembele in his squad beyond the length of his current deal.
Raphinha remains keen on moving to the Catalan giants in the upcoming window and is willing to wait and see how Dembele’s future plays out.
