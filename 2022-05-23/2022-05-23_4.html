     Is Walmart Juneteenth Ice Cream Real? Fact-Checking Company Website
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some of us celebrated that this culturally Black thing that we have known about for at least the last couple of decades was now being recognized on a national level.
But whether it’s real or not, Black people’s reaction to it is definitely real, and, it appears many of us are displeased.
Obviously, this is bigger than just ice cream.
I mean, what does Juneteenth mean in a country where every day is Columbus Day?
Some people think Black people’s complaints about Walmart’s alleged ice cream is another instance of us never being satisfied.

     Murals, tours and movies: City announces how Juneteenth will be celebrated across historic districts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a measure meant to punish the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War and did not cover enslaved Africans in border states.It also failed to free those held in bondage in Texas.
That would not come until June 19, 1865, when Union General Gordon Granger landed in Galveston, Texas, and issued General Order #3.
Popular belief is that the enslaved Africans in Texas did not know about the Emancipation Proclamation until Granger's announcement.However, some historians have disputed that claim.In 2021, Juneteenth became a federal holiday.
My father came with a gun and police told them if he busted a cap they'd let the mob have us," Lee recalled.
"They started throwing things at the house and when they left, they took out the furniture and burned it and burned the house.

     Walmart's Juneteenth 'Celebration' Ice Cream Draws Backlash

     Summary: Welp, here's the latest entry to the Tone-Deaf Marketing Hall of Fame (there really should be one by now) ... Walmart's Juneteenth Ice Cream is MOA -- melting on arrival -- with critics, as one might expect.
As soon as the retail giant started putting the "Celebration Edition" on its freezer shelves ... the Twitter mob sounded off, calling the idea "garbage," and worse.
The pints contain swirled red velvet and cheesecake ice cream flavors ... and included the message, "Share and celebrate African-American culture, emancipation and enduring hope."
Walmart is also launching a similar "celebration edition" for Pride Month, which is also coming up in June.
That flavor is white chocolate ice cream with brownies and cherries.

     Summary: This past weekend, while some of the country was experiencing a serious heat wave, people were talking about ice cream, but not to help folks brave the rising temperatures.
On Twitter, many were sharing their confusion and disdain over a Juneteenth ice cream from Walmart.
Walmart selling Juneteenth ice cream?!
I can see both sides of the coin: why a Walmart ice cream for Juneteenth would come off as tacky but also why the uproar over it could also be exhausting.
