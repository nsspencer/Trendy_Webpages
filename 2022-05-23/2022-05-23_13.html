     Ukraine Intel Chief Says Someone Tried to Assassinate Putin in March
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian Chief of Defense Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin survived an assassination attempt two months ago.
During an interview with the Ukrainian newspaper Ukrainska Pravda, Budanov said Putin was targeted for assassination while visiting the Caucasus in early March, shortly after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.
“There was an attempt to assassinate Putin,” Budanov said.
It should be noted that a low-level insurgency by Islamist activists continues in the Caucasus region.
Lost in the news of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was the fact that tensions were flaring again over the disputed region.

     Ukrainian Intelligence: Putin Survived Assassination Attempt Early in Conflict
    </h2>

     Summary: Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly survived an assassination attempt, according to Ukrainian Intelligence.
Details are minimal, but officials say it happened two months ago during the start of Russia's brutal invasion of its neighbor.
It includes $20 billion for military assistance and is intended to support Ukraine through September.
A new video is said to show a strike on a Russian missile launcher.
As the war with Russia drags on, the country's inability to export millions of tons of grain has sent global food prices soaring.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Western officials have cast doubts over claims Vladimir Putin was the subject of a recent assassination attempt, citing the increasingly small circle of contacts the Russian leader allows around him.
Western sources have been unable to verify the claims, but said any such attempt on the Russian leader’s life would be challenging.
“President Putin is operating – and has done through Covid and in an enduring basis – in a smaller and smaller grouping.
So were anyone to attempt to do something like that it would be a hugely complex operation,” the official said.
Absolutely unsuccessful attempt, but it really took place… It was about two months ago.
