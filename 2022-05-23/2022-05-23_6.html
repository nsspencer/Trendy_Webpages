     Biden says U.S. willing to use force to defend Taiwan — prompting backlash from China
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday said he would be willing to use force to defend Taiwan, prompting thanks from the democratic, self-ruled island — but sharp criticism from China.
When asked at a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida whether the U.S. would be prepared to defend Taiwan if attacked, Biden replied, "Yes."
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry thanked Biden for reaffirming U.S. support for the island if Beijing invaded.
Taiwan and mainland China are separated by the Taiwan Strait, which is only about 100 miles wide (160 kilometers) at its narrowest point.
China claims Taiwan as part of its own territory and has been putting pressure on the democratic island to accept its rule.

     Summary: Biden says the U.S. would be willing to intervene military to defend TaiwanEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/APSEOUL — President Biden said Monday that the U.S. would defend Taiwan if it was attacked by mainland China, while insisting that America's policy toward the island had not changed.
Biden, asked at a press conference in Tokyo if the U.S. would intervene military to defend Taiwan, said, "that's the commitment we made."
"Greater U.S. commitment or involvement with regards to Taiwan will certainly be appreciated by Kishida and others in the Japanese government," Wallace added.
Biden also unveiled a new trade agreement dubbed the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF).
Biden also received strong backing for the IPEF, and America's policy toward Asia in general, from South Korea's government.

     Biden: US would intervene militarily to defend Taiwan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TOKYO (AP) — President Joe Biden said Monday that the U.S. would intervene militarily if China were to invade Taiwan, saying the burden to protect Taiwan is “even stronger’ after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Biden, at a news conference in Tokyo, said “yes” when asked if he was willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if China invaded.
The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which has governed U.S. relations with the island, does not require the U.S. to step in militarily to defend Taiwan if China invades, but makes it American policy to ensure Taiwan has the resources to defend itself and to prevent any unilateral change of status in Taiwan by Beijing.
Under the “one China” policy, the U.S. recognizes Beijing as the government of China and doesn’t have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
In a CNN town hall in October, Biden was asked about using the U.S. military to defend Taiwan and replied, “Yes, we have a commitment to do that.”Biden’s comments came just before he formally launched a long-anticipated Indo-Pacific trade pact that excludes Taiwan.

     Summary: President Joe Biden said Monday that the United States would be willing to intervene militarily if China were to invade the self-governing island of Taiwan, again sowing confusion over American policy in the region.
Speaking during a news conference in Tokyo alongside Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Biden said Beijing was already “flirting with danger” with its recent military drills and other aggression toward Taiwan, which China views as its own territory.
“Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?”“Yes,” Biden responded.
He reiterated our One China Policy and our commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” the official said.

     Biden takes aggressive posture toward China on Asia trip
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The United States has long maintained a policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan, meaning it is deliberately unclear what it would do if it comes to defending Taiwan.
The intended audience of the announcement was clear, even though Biden, during the launch event Monday, did not specifically name China.
Although it was Trump who formally withdrew the United States from that agreement, it also lacked support from both parties on Capitol Hill and would not have been ratified.
AdvertisementStanding next to Biden during Monday’s news conference at Akasaka Palace, Kishida repeatedly stressed Japan’s wish for the United States to rejoin the TPP.
Market access — lowering the barrier for trade activity with the United States — was an important incentive to convince Southeast Asian countries to join the TPP.
