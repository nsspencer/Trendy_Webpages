     Obi-Wan and Dr Strange Elden Ring builds duel to win pop culture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the best points of FromSoftware’s latest RPG game is the many wonderful Elden Ring builds that are possible, from a notorious Bloodborne boss to Jesus and Satan.
Recently, Marvel’s Doctor Strange and Star Wars’ Obi-Wan Kenobi met and fought in the fantasy game, presumably to decide which pop culture leviathan owns the month of May.
Doctor Strange, of course, had elegant robes, various powerful Elden Ring spells and incantations, and an equally stylish beard, so both players were pretty equally matched.
For more on Elden Ring cosplay, a community-run fashion show is in the works, with plenty of wonderful creations already available to view.

     Elden Ring Mod Pits Every Demigod Against Each Other in a Battle Royale

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An Elden Ring modder has orchestrated the ultimate Battle Royale, pitting each of the game's demigod bosses against one another.
YouTube user Garden of Eyes - who's previously modded legendary summon Let Me Solo Her into Elden Ring and pit Malenia against every other boss - uploaded a video of all six demigod bosses battling throughout a handful of different rounds with different rulesets.
A battle royale of the strongest Demigod.
Elden Ring has proved somewhat of a cultural phenomenon since it was release in February, with players finding a ton of different ways to interact with the game.

     Elden Ring mod that never makes you say goodbye is almost here
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Recently, YouTuber and modder LukeYui posited that Elden Ring — already a pretty great video game — might be even better with one straightforward tweak: Limitless co-op.
In a few days, that mod will be out in the wild, putting that idea to the test.
The seamless co-op mod is an unofficial work-in-progress and likely to run into issues, but the idea behind it is neat: As Elden Ring players know, playing with others in co-op means that other aspects of the game, like horseback riding and resting at bonfires, are unavailable during a co-op session.
All of these restrictions exist for sensible game balance reasons, as the developers at FromSoftware likely want there to be some challenge still present when summoning help.
But playing with others isn’t always just for beating games — sometimes it’s simply about experiencing them, and that’s always better with company.

     Congrats, Blaidd's Voice Actor Read Your Horny Elden Ring Tweets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s not easy when your pining for the superior, virtual men in your favorite video game goes unnoticed.
But rarely, once in a blue moon, a voice actor will provide solace to fans by acknowledging your appreciation for their characters.
Today fans of Elden Ring’s breakout furry husband Blaidd the Half-Wolf are eating well, as his voice actor not only read y’alls’ terminally down-bad tweets for the NPC wolfman, but leaned into them with gusto.
In a recent episode of BuzzFeed Multiplayer, Scott Arthur, the voice actor behind Blaidd set the record straight on how to properly pronounce the wolf-man’s name (it’s “Blithe”) and read some of y’alls’ best and worst thirst tweets.
Although most of the tweets Arthur read were as innocuous as a horny Twitter post could be for a 2D video game character, one tweet proved to be too much for even this adventurous-seeming voice actor to read aloud.

     Summary: If fans ever wondered who would win in a fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Doctor Strange, Elden Ring's PvP with creative players answers the question.
There are different metas all the time for what is the most effective build in Elden Ring, such as what is used in many speedrun categories.
However, a lot of Elden Ring’s fun as an action RPG comes from its role-playing.
Meanwhile, the Doctor Strange opponent utilizes a wide array of incantations as a Master of the Mystic Arts.
Elden Ring is out now for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

     ‘Elden Ring’ Is About To Get True Co-Op This Week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elden Ring FromSoftwareElden Ring is largely a solo experience, but like past FromSoftware games, does integrate multiplayer where you’re able to call in assistance in certain areas for tough battles, and it has PvP where you can battle other players through invasions.
It’s from LukeYui, a well-known FromSoft modder, and he’s been working on a true co-op mode for Elden Ring which will be out on Nexus Mods this Friday, May 27, for the PC version of the game.
Among the functionality the co-op mod has:Teaming up in combat anywhere in the game.
It’s unclear why despite having co-op elements, FromSoftware has never done full co-op in any of their games.
It reminds me of dying for co-op Skyrim back in the day, considering I’ve never enjoyed exploring an open world as much as I have Elden Ring’s, since Skyrim.

     Elden Ring Player's Attempt to Ambush Invader Goes Horribly Wrong

     Summary: Like other open world games, Elden Ring is not without its fair share of bugs and glitches.
Likewise, as with other games, Elden Ring bugs and glitches can range from extremely frustrating to hilarious depending on the situation and outcome.
A great example of this would be the Elden Ring rotted dog glitch, which was most prevalent in the region of Caelid.
Much like the invincible Malenia glitch in Elden Ring, for some reason the ladder player was completely unaffected.

That’s certainly true of Elden Ring, which – in many ways – is far more epic and grandiose than what has come before.
But there’s another, more notable tribute to Bloodborne in Elden Ring.
Elden Ring has been continually improved by... Patches.
The beauty of Elden Ring is that while intimidatingly vast there is always something fascinating to discover.
