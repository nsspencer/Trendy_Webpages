     Dier and Lloris call on Tottenham to ‘take advantage’ of Champions League qualification: ‘It’s in the club’s hands now’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur captain Hugo Lloris and defender Eric Dier have called on the club to take advantage of their Champions League qualification.
Spurs secured a top-four finish on the final day of the Premier League season, beating Norwich City 5-0 to finish fourth ahead of rivals Arsenal.
They have not competed in the Champions League since the 2019-20 campaign, when they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage by RB Leipzig.
Dier, who has been at the club since 2014, believes Tottenham must make the most of Champions League qualification.
“I think the club needs to take advantage of this moment, take advantage of this team and this manager,” he said.

     Summary: TOTTENHAM are ready to battle Arsenal for Gabriel Jesus after beating their arch-rivals to the final Champions League spot.
Spurs reached the top four in style by smashing Norwich 5-0 at Carrow Road on Sunday.
His agent Marcelo Pettinati has already confirmed he has held talks with Arsenal over a possible switch.
Conte warned after the win at Norwich of the need for more recruits for next term with the extra games that come with Champions League football, and with the re-introduction of the five-sub rule into the Premier League.
Fresh wing-back competition could be targeted, as well as a new central midfielder with Youri Tielemans and Christian Eriksen both under consideration.

     Summary: More infoTottenham Hotspur's January transfer window exploits poured fresh gas into their Antonio Conte-led rocket with top-four coordinates set.
Their winter business ultimately helped them leapfrog Arsenal to secure fourth and a Champions League return, which bodes well for the summer.
According to football.london, Spurs are well aware that their January dealings tilted the top-four race against Arsenal into their favour.
Meanwhile, Mikel Arteta offloaded five first-team players without recruiting a single addition after Arsenal spent more than any other Premier League club in the summer window.

     Paddy Power’s dodgy lasagne stunt only spurs on Tottenham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paddy Power has demonstrated its ability to think outside the (lasagne) box yet again after staging a ‘suspect delivery’ at Tottenham Hotspur’s ground this weekend.
Two Arsenal-shirt-wearing chefs were snapped carrying boxes labeled ‘lasagne’ to the stadium in a staged fast-food delivery ahead of the club’s clash with Norwich (which ended 5-0 in Spurs’ favor).
A spokesman for the Irish bookie said: “Arsenal’s defeat earlier this week left the door wide open for Spurs to steal the last remaining Champions League spot.
And, with a trip to rock-bottom Norwich being the smallest final-day hurdle known to man, their qualification looks nailed on.
Lasagne has had an eventful history in marketing, from the horsemeat scandal to singing packaging created by frozen food brand Stouffer.
