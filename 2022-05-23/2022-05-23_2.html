     Summary: The Athletic have reported that some at the Tottenham Hotspur hierarchy were not happy with head coach Antonio Conte’s public comments about Tanguy Ndombele this season.
Ndombele returned to his former club Lyon on loan from Tottenham in the January transfer window.
The French club have an option to make the loan deal of the Tottenham midfielder permanent in the summer transfer window.

We do not think that Ndombele is the kind of player who would take Tottenham to the next level.

Son added that he felt Moura changed the game for Tottenham, providing a spark off the bench in place of Kulusevski.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the past few weeks, it’s been surmised that Gabriel Jesus was likely to leave Manchester City for opportunities at a different Premier League club.
However, the North London club that was most closely linked with the Brazilian was Arsenal, not Spurs.
However, the Telegraph is reporting that Jesus is a target for Tottenham this summer, with the club already having made contact with his agent, and the player being “aware” of Spurs’ interest.
But what Arsenal can’t offer (and Tottenham can!)
Gonna be a whole bunch of these kinds of stories in the next few weeks and months.

     Summary: The Tottenham Hotspur hierarchy will tell Antonio Conte in the coming days that they intend to fully back him this summer if he stays at the club, The Athletic understands.
Chairman Daniel Levy is expected to offer Conte a clutch of new signings, including established, experienced players.
Instead, Conte has maintained that he will speak to Levy and managing director of football Fabio Paratici about his future once the season finishes.
With the campaign over, Conte is enjoying a holiday in Italy and will speak to Levy and Paratici in the coming days.
Conte has repeatedly asked for his employers to match his ambition, and that is precisely the case they will be making this week.

     Dier and Lloris call on Tottenham to ‘take advantage’ of Champions League qualification: ‘It’s in the club’s hands now’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur captain Hugo Lloris and defender Eric Dier have called on the club to take advantage of their Champions League qualification.
Spurs secured a top-four finish on the final day of the Premier League season, beating Norwich City 5-0 to finish fourth ahead of rivals Arsenal.
They have not competed in the Champions League since the 2019-20 campaign, when they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage by RB Leipzig.
Dier, who has been at the club since 2014, believes Tottenham must make the most of Champions League qualification.
“I think the club needs to take advantage of this moment, take advantage of this team and this manager,” he said.

     Spurs Beat Arsenal to Top Four Spot, May Create Gap in EPL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the pressure was on, Arsenal went to Spurs and lost and then compounded that defeat by losing at Newcastle, while Spurs, who was four points behind with three games remaining, capitalized by beating Burnley.
Arsenal and Tottenham are both thought to be interested in signing Gabriel Jesus, who is likely to leave Manchester City this summer.
Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, is known to have been trying to build bridges with Pochettino, with a job swap a possibility.
Firstly, Arsenal’s record against top sides is shaky: nine points from 10 league games against other Big Six teams isn’t terrible, but all three wins came against opponents down on their luck.
When Arsenal was bottom of the table with no points from three games, this finish would have seemed a great achievement.

     Tottenham: Antonio Conte returning Spurs to the Champions League is a huge success, what comes next is harder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is a platform to build something on and it's a platform that Tottenham desperately needed to return to after missing out on Champions League play for two consecutive seasons.
When Nuno Espirito Santo was fired in November, months after he was hired to lead Spurs, this team could've gone plenty of different ways.
For now, despite their success, nothing is set in stone yet as Conte said after Spurs' 5-0 victory over Norwich City.
But he acknowledged the achievement of what the team has done saying, "It's very very difficult - to reach a place in the Champions League.
The team will need more depth not only for their return to Champions League but also since the Premier League will return to allowing five substitutes per game.
