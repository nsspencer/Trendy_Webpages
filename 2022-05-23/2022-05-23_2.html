     Summary: More infoTottenham Hotspur's January transfer window exploits poured fresh gas into their Antonio Conte-led rocket with top-four coordinates set.
Their winter business ultimately helped them leapfrog Arsenal to secure fourth and a Champions League return, which bodes well for the summer.
According to football.london, Spurs are well aware that their January dealings tilted the top-four race against Arsenal into their favour.
Meanwhile, Mikel Arteta offloaded five first-team players without recruiting a single addition after Arsenal spent more than any other Premier League club in the summer window.

     Dier and Lloris call on Tottenham to ‘take advantage’ of Champions League qualification: ‘It’s in the club’s hands now’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur captain Hugo Lloris and defender Eric Dier have called on the club to take advantage of their Champions League qualification.
Spurs secured a top-four finish on the final day of the Premier League season, beating Norwich City 5-0 to finish fourth ahead of rivals Arsenal.
They have not competed in the Champions League since the 2019-20 campaign, when they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage by RB Leipzig.
Dier, who has been at the club since 2014, believes Tottenham must make the most of Champions League qualification.
“I think the club needs to take advantage of this moment, take advantage of this team and this manager,” he said.

Spurs reached the top four in style by smashing Norwich 5-0 at Carrow Road on Sunday.
His agent Marcelo Pettinati has already confirmed he has held talks with Arsenal over a possible switch.
Conte warned after the win at Norwich of the need for more recruits for next term with the extra games that come with Champions League football, and with the re-introduction of the five-sub rule into the Premier League.
Fresh wing-back competition could be targeted, as well as a new central midfielder with Youri Tielemans and Christian Eriksen both under consideration.

     Spurs Beat Arsenal to Top Four Spot, May Create Gap in EPL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the pressure was on, Arsenal went to Spurs and lost and then compounded that defeat by losing at Newcastle, while Spurs, who was four points behind with three games remaining, capitalized by beating Burnley.
Arsenal and Tottenham are both thought to be interested in signing Gabriel Jesus, who is likely to leave Manchester City this summer.
Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, is known to have been trying to build bridges with Pochettino, with a job swap a possibility.
Firstly, Arsenal’s record against top sides is shaky: nine points from 10 league games against other Big Six teams isn’t terrible, but all three wins came against opponents down on their luck.
When Arsenal was bottom of the table with no points from three games, this finish would have seemed a great achievement.

     Tottenham: Why Levy must buck transfer trend with bold Conte rebuild
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the majority of Pochettino's five-and-a-half year reign, however, Levy and the club were focussed on the stadium build, consuming precious time and resources.
Now, by contrast, there are no excuses for the club not to back Conte.
If they are to push on next season and keep Conte and Kane happy, Spurs must build on these foundations with a bold and intelligent summer rebuild.
All the noises from within suggest Spurs are willing to do so, with Levy preparing to hand Conte significant funds and make concessions for his demands to sign experience.
A return to the Champions League has justified Levy's approach but Spurs' progress will count for little if its architect, Conte, feels the club cannot match his ambition at this week's summit.
