    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS -- Golden State's Splash Brothers were trying not to get wet at the start of the second half Tuesday night as water leaked through the roof of the American Airlines Center, delaying Game 4 of the Western Conference finals between the Warriors and Mavericks by 16 minutes.
This was the second time water dripping through the American Airlines Center roof affected a Mavericks game.
It also delayed the start of a Timberwolves-Mavericks game by 15 minutes back on March 21.
The Mavericks led 62-47 at the half.
Once the game resumed, the Mavericks continued to build on their lead, jumping out to a 99-70 advantage by the end of the third quarter and going on to win 119-109.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the tragic shooting that took place at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas earlier in the day, Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr delivered a powerful message during his pregame press conference.
After the game, Steve Kerr was asked about Steph Curry, who urged fans to watch Kerr's pregame message with the same attentiveness they would watch Game 4 with.
Following a Tweet he sent out regarding Kerr's pregame message, Steph went up to his coach to acknowledge his appreciation.
It was unspoken, but I knew what he was expressing," Kerr said of the moment he shared with Steph prior to the game.
Both Steph Curry and Steve Kerr were rightfully shaken by what happened earlier in the day, but the superstar point guard is proud of his head coach for using his voice and platform to encourage change.

     Summary: CNN —The Dallas Mavericks staved off elimination and avoided a series sweep in the Western Conference Finals, as Luka Doncic led his team to a 119-109 win over the Golden State Warriors.
“You never know,” he added when asked if Dallas could still win the series.
It’s going to be really tough with Golden State, we know that, but we have to stay together.”Dallas’ defense really hindered the Warriors’ shooting ability, with Steph Curry leading the way for Golden State with just 20 points and eight assists.
When the action finally resumed, Dallas outscored Golden State 37-23 in the third quarter to cement an unassailable lead.
“It’s still 3-1 and Golden State is a tough place to play, but we’ve won there before.

     Summary: As you might have noticed, Golden State has made the man who penned that piece look funny in the light.
The Mavs are making more triples than Golden State, as we suggested here that they might.
It’s part of how Wiggins has logged 20.7 points, 7 rebounds and 3.7 assists in the series on stellar efficiency.
All told, Wiggins has been basically just as effective on offense against Dončić as Dončić has been against him.
Similarly, Beck has written on Golden State’s incredible on-court chemistry and the club’s one-of-a-kind comeback ability making a comeback.
