     Kate Moss expected to be called by Johnny Depp's legal team as a witness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Kate Moss, who dated Johnny Depp in the 1990s, is expected to be called to testify as a rebuttal witness by his legal team in the ongoing trial between Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard, a source close to Depp tells CNN.
A source close to Depp confirmed that Moss and Depp remain close to this day.
Depp has sued Heard for $50 million alleging that a 2018 op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post defamed him, alleging the piece -- which did not mention him by name -- falsely painted him as an abuser.
Heard has countersued Depp for $100 million, saying statements his attorney made calling her abuse claims a "hoax" were defamatory.
Heard has testified on stand that she immediately thought about rumors related to Moss at the time Heard and her sister were in an alleged altercation with Depp.

I just, in my head, instantly think of Kate Moss and stairs, and I swung at him …” Heard had also referenced Moss during Depp’s U.K. defamation trial, at which she reportedly described hearing a rumor that he had shoved a former girlfriend — whom she believed to be Moss — down a staircase.
“You thought he was going to throw your sister down the stairs like he had thrown Kate Moss down the stairs, right?” one of Depp’s attorneys said, alluding to the allegation.
On Thursday, Heard’s team called actress Ellen Barkin to testify about a friendship and, later, brief “sexual” relationship with Depp.
