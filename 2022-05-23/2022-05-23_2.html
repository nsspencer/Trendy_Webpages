     Former Denver Broncos draft pick involved in viral airport fight video

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Stan Szeto-USA TODAY SportsFormer Denver Broncos third-round pick Brendan Langley was involved in a fight with an airport employee and the video has gone viral.
Former Denver Broncos third-round pick Brendan Langley, now under contract with the Calgary Stampeders in the Canadian Football League, was involved in a fight at the airport recently and a video of the fight has been going viral on the internet.
The United employee comes up after getting hit by Langley and once again goes back to Langley like a woozy fighter trying to go one more round.
A longer video clip was also posted on Twitter showing Langley and the United employee getting physical for a bit before the clip that has gone viral.
It’s unclear as of the time of this post being written what led to the employee leaving his post and getting physical with Langley.

AdvertisementThen, the video shows, the employee walks closer and apparently stuns Langley as he uses his left hand to hit his face.
United Ground Express informed the parent company it has terminated the worker, United Airlines said Monday.
“United Airlines does not tolerate violence of any kind at our airports or on board our planes and we are working with local authorities in their investigation of this matter,” the airline said in a statement provided to The Post.

     Summary: A major altercation with a United Airlines employee at New Jersey’s Newark International Airport Monday morning has now led to CFL receiver Brendan Langley being arrested and charged with simple assault.
Langley then responds with what looks like an open-handed slap and several closed-fist punches, knocking the employee down.
8:39 AM PT — Cops tell us the passenger, ex-NFL player Brendan Langley, was arrested and charged with simple assault.
The video certainly seems to show Langley making much more impactful contact than anything the employee does.
The team could cut Langley themselves, or commissioner Randy Ambrosie could not only force a cut, but also ban other teams from signing Langley (that’s rare, but it has happened).
