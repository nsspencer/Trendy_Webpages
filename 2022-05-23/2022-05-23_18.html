     GOP Gov. Kemp fires back after Stacey Abrams calls Georgia ‘worst state’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams briefly forgot the first lesson of Politics 101 over the weekend: Never criticize the place you’re running in.
Abrams, making her second bid for the Georgia governor’s mansion, trashed the Peach State to her fellow Democrats as the “worst state in the country to live” during a Saturday night dinner in Gwinnett County, hitting Republicans over their favored slogan.
“I am tired of hearing about being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live​,” said Abrams, who acknowledged immediately after voicing the sentiment that attacks were likely to start coming in hot.

     Georgia GOP attacks Stacey Abrams ... for speaking the truth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stacey Abrams is right: Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, has helped turn his state into one of the worst places to live in the country.
Abrams, the Democrats’ presumptive nominee to face off against Kemp for the governorship this fall, made her declaration during a fundraiser in Georgia on Saturday.
On top of that, Georgia Republicans passed a law last year — S.B.
But like civil rights activists in the past, Abrams hasn't minced words about precisely who she’s condemning and why.
And it’s not Georgia generally — it’s the right-wing officials imposing their oppressive fantasies on it.

     Stacey Abrams' playbook faces a new test in second run for Georgia governor

     Summary: (CNN) When Stacey Abrams acknowledged defeat to Republican Brian Kemp in her 2018 campaign for governor of Georgia, she refused to call it a "concession."
We had record turnout and we saw a composition of voters the state had never seen before," Abrams told CNN.
"We have to remember, voter suppression isn't about stopping every voter," Abrams said.
Democratic groups and Abrams' campaign know it, and believe they are better equipped -- and funded -- to enact the intensive groundwork that was a hallmark of her first run for governor.
Kemp says Abrams will unify divided GOPKemp has traveled a bumpier road to his expected rematch with Abrams.
