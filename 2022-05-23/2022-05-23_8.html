     Summary: Biden says the U.S. would be willing to intervene militarily to defend TaiwanEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/APSEOUL — President Biden said Monday that the U.S. would defend Taiwan if it was attacked by mainland China, while insisting that America's policy toward the island had not changed.
Biden, asked at a press conference in Tokyo if the U.S. would intervene military to defend Taiwan, said, "that's the commitment we made."
"Greater U.S. commitment or involvement with regards to Taiwan will certainly be appreciated by Kishida and others in the Japanese government," Wallace added.
Biden also unveiled a new trade agreement dubbed the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF).
Biden also received strong backing for the IPEF, and America's policy toward Asia in general, from South Korea's government.

     EXPLAINER: US keeps world guessing on Taiwan stance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is no mutual defense treaty between the U.S. and Taiwan, but America sells the Taiwanese military hardware.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Biden’s comment “highlighted our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to help provide Taiwan the means to defend itself.”Is it that simple?
The confusion is a reminder of Washington's stance of “strategic ambiguity” when it comes to Taiwan — essentially, leaving China guessing about what exactly the U.S. would do if there was an invasion.
“We have a deep political, economic and military relationship with a place that we don’t officially recognize," said Julian Ku, a professor of international law at Hofstra University in New York.
And there was Biden's November trip to New Hampshire, one day after a virtual meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

     Summary: En 1945, tras la derrota japonesa, la República de China recuperó la isla de Taiwán, que China había perdido en una guerra anterior con los japoneses.
Pero cuatro años más tarde, en 1949, el Kuomintang fue derrotado en una cruenta guerra civil en el continente por el ejército del Partido Comunista.
“Hay una sola China y el gobierno de la República Popular es el único legítimo y Taiwán es parte de China”, señala el Ministerio de Exteriores en Beijing.
En Taiwán la postura oficial es más ambigua con respecto a la reunificación, y los gobiernos de la isla han buscado mantener el statu quo.
Pero el Kuomintang y otras fuerzas por -reunificación insisten también en que la República de China es el gobierno legítimo de todo el territorio.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Observers say Biden’s verbal commitments to defend Taiwan may encourage rather than deter Chinese aggression against Taiwan.
Despite the risks, there is strong bipartisan support for an explicit U.S. commitment to defend Taiwan regardless of whether the U.S. could actually deliver on that promise.
Biden’s Taiwan comments came during the second half of his four-day Asia trip designed to counter China’s growing economic, diplomatic and military influence in the region.
On the follow-up question, in which he responded affirmatively that “yes,” the U.S. would be willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan, he did not consult those notes.
“A question that must be on everyone’s mind in Beijing is whether the U.S. has already changed its [Taiwan] policy.

     Biden on Taiwan: Three theories on the U.S. president repeated, apparent gaffes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadWhen it comes to President Biden and Taiwan, a confusing pattern has developed.
It goes like this: Biden is asked if the United States would respond militarily if China invaded Taiwan.
Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing claims, is not recognized diplomatically by the United States but works closely with Washington.
One of the easiest explanations is that each time he spoke of defending Taiwan, Biden was misspeaking.
It’d be an understandable mistake: Taiwan policy is complicated, shrouded in lingo that often only those who track the issue closely seem to understand.

     China-Taiwan tensions: Biden says U.S. to defend Taiwan against China, but can it?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Taiwan is now a prosperous democracy, and a large majority of Taiwanese reject reunification with China.
Biden’s remarks went beyond Washington’s historically more ambiguous stance on whether it would defend Taiwan in the case of an invasion.
But the greater disparity in population (roughly 60:1) and military power between Taiwan and China is more unfavorable than Ukraine’s situation vis-a-vis Russia.
That said, Taiwan is a fraction of the landmass of Ukraine and thus easy for China to blanket with surveillance.
China also has far greater economic resilience than Russia and can mass-produce the expensive long-range missiles Russia appears to be exhausting.

     Biden's Taiwan comment hangs over summit with leaders of Japan, India and Australia on final day of Asia trip
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Speaking to a high-level summit here of Indo-Pacific leaders, Biden underscored the grave consequences of a war that continues to grind forward, despite withering sanctions from a mostly-united West.
"We're navigating a dark hour in our shared history," Biden said as he sat facing the leaders of India, Australia, and Japan.
Biden's statement loomed over his final day in Tokyo, where he was meeting with the leaders of Japan, India and Australia as part of a revitalized Quad Leaders' Summit.
"The policy has not changed at all and I stated that when I made my statement," Biden said at an event with Quad leaders.
While acknowledging the US still agrees with the "One China" policy, Biden said on Monday that the idea of Taiwan being taken by force "is (just not) appropriate."
