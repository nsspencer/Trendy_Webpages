     Jack Harrison now open to Leeds United exit this summer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Saikat Mandal 23rd May, 2022 | 6:10pmJack Harrison open to Leeds United exit this summerLeeds United winger Jack Harrison is open to the idea of leaving the club in the summer, according to The Telegraph.
Harrison scored the winning goal for the Whites on Sunday (22 May) against Brentford and helped the club avoid relegation to the Championship.
At the same time, he is not an irreplaceable asset, so it all depends on the offer Leeds receive for him, if at all.
If they get a good offer, the club could be open to selling him as well.

     Summary: Kalvin Phillips has told Leeds United’s YouTube channel that Raphinha has been “unbelievable” since he “came through the doors at Elland Road.
It is likely that the Brazil international will now leave Elland Road, after his two years at the club.
Speaking after his boyhood club survived and secured a third successive Premier League season, Phillips raved about Raphinha.
He branded him “unbelievable” and that any critics of him recently have been wrong.
While he probably deserves a big-money move to a Barcelona or another huge club, could he now stay at Elland Road?

     Leeds owner backs Jesse Marsch after Premier League survival
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Julien Laurens speaks about how Leeds avoided relegation on the final day of the Premier League season.
(1:34)Leeds United owner Andrea Radrizzani has pledged to work with manager Jesse Marsch on improving the squad for next season after they narrowly avoided relegation on the last day of the Premier League campaign.
American coach Jesse Marsch replaced Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds in March and ensured their survival in the Premier League.
Craig Mercer/MB Media/Getty Images"Staying in the Premier League was our objective this year and we've managed to obtain our top-flight status, but this is not success and improvements are needed," Radrizzani added.
"As a board we will work hard with Jesse Marsch this summer to improve the squad and find a way to deliver the kind of performances you all deserve.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Those that questioned Raphinha’s commitment to the Leeds United cause in recent months were shut down emphatically at the Brentford Community Stadium.
Although, there will still be some hope that a new contract might be tempting for the wideman with Premier League status secure.
Whatever he chooses to do this summer, there shouldn’t – and won’t – be any animosity aimed towards Raphinha from Leeds fans.
He has also - more importantly - ensured that should he depart, he leaves the club as a true modern Leeds United icon.

     Summary: Sign up to our Leeds United newsletter Sign up Thanks for signing up!
JOB DONE - Jesse Marsch has ticked off his first Leeds United brief and kept them in the Premier League.
It's frankly ridiculous that they don't like to hear an American accent in their sport, in their country, it's horrible.
According to Marsch he mainly keeps abreast of what is being written about Leeds so he can address any potential negativity surrounding individuals in his squad.
"The guys that have played here or are from England know what the media is like and don't pay much attention to it either."
