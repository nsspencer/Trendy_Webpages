     Elden Ring - Best Ashes of War
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Elden Ring, From Software fundamentally changed the weapon art system with Ashes of War.
There are tons of Ashes of War to find throughout the Lands Between, and almost all are viable options... if you know how to build around them, at least.
On the other hand, some Ashes of War don't need synergy so much as they require practice and skill.
That said, certainly not all Ashes of War are created equal.
These are the ten best Ashes of War in Elden Ring.

     Elden Ring Mod Pits Every Demigod Against Each Other in a Battle Royale

     Summary: An Elden Ring modder has orchestrated the ultimate Battle Royale, pitting each of the game's demigod bosses against one another.
YouTube user Garden of Eyes - who's previously modded legendary summon Let Me Solo Her into Elden Ring and pit Malenia against every other boss - uploaded a video of all six demigod bosses battling throughout a handful of different rounds with different rulesets.
A battle royale of the strongest Demigod.
Elden Ring has proved somewhat of a cultural phenomenon since it was release in February, with players finding a ton of different ways to interact with the game.

     Elden Ring mod that never makes you say goodbye is almost here
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Recently, YouTuber and modder LukeYui posited that Elden Ring — already a pretty great video game — might be even better with one straightforward tweak: Limitless co-op.
In a few days, that mod will be out in the wild, putting that idea to the test.
The seamless co-op mod is an unofficial work-in-progress and likely to run into issues, but the idea behind it is neat: As Elden Ring players know, playing with others in co-op means that other aspects of the game, like horseback riding and resting at bonfires, are unavailable during a co-op session.
All of these restrictions exist for sensible game balance reasons, as the developers at FromSoftware likely want there to be some challenge still present when summoning help.
But playing with others isn’t always just for beating games — sometimes it’s simply about experiencing them, and that’s always better with company.

     Congrats, Blaidd's Voice Actor Read Your Horny Elden Ring Tweets

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s not easy when your pining for the superior, virtual men in your favorite video game goes unnoticed.
But rarely, once in a blue moon, a voice actor will provide solace to fans by acknowledging your appreciation for their characters.
Today fans of Elden Ring’s breakout furry husband Blaidd the Half-Wolf are eating well, as his voice actor not only read y’alls’ terminally down-bad tweets for the NPC wolfman, but leaned into them with gusto.
In a recent episode of BuzzFeed Multiplayer, Scott Arthur, the voice actor behind Blaidd set the record straight on how to properly pronounce the wolf-man’s name (it’s “Blithe”) and read some of y’alls’ best and worst thirst tweets.
Although most of the tweets Arthur read were as innocuous as a horny Twitter post could be for a 2D video game character, one tweet proved to be too much for even this adventurous-seeming voice actor to read aloud.

     Summary: If fans ever wondered who would win in a fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Doctor Strange, Elden Ring's PvP with creative players answers the question.
There are different metas all the time for what is the most effective build in Elden Ring, such as what is used in many speedrun categories.
However, a lot of Elden Ring’s fun as an action RPG comes from its role-playing.
Meanwhile, the Doctor Strange opponent utilizes a wide array of incantations as a Master of the Mystic Arts.
Elden Ring is out now for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

The Seamless Coop mod, on the other hand, is adding hugely important multiplayer functionality for players that just want to enjoy persistent co-op gameplay with friends.
Seamless Coop mod for Elden Ring has been in production for some time now, and the developers seem to have thought most things through by now.

     Elden Ring 2: When Will We Get A Sequel?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prior to the massive success of "Elden Ring", FromSoftware had made a name for itself with the "Souls" series, a third-person RPG franchise also known for its difficulty and emphasis on strategic combat.
"Elden Ring" is no different and is created in virtually the same vein as its predecessors.
So while you may love the collection of both endearing and detestable characters you encounter in "Elden Ring," it's unlikely you'll see them in further installments and continue with the same lore.
"There is no cohesive timeline to any of the games, so Elden Ring will be no different if any others do come out," Redditor u/brohandas-ghandi said when discussing a sequel.
"Elden Ring 2 can exist... but in a different place, different timeline, different story about a ring that happens to be Elden."

     ‘Elden Ring’ Is About To Get True Co-Op This Week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elden Ring FromSoftwareElden Ring is largely a solo experience, but like past FromSoftware games, does integrate multiplayer where you’re able to call in assistance in certain areas for tough battles, and it has PvP where you can battle other players through invasions.
It’s from LukeYui, a well-known FromSoft modder, and he’s been working on a true co-op mode for Elden Ring which will be out on Nexus Mods this Friday, May 27, for the PC version of the game.
Among the functionality the co-op mod has:Teaming up in combat anywhere in the game.
It’s unclear why despite having co-op elements, FromSoftware has never done full co-op in any of their games.
It reminds me of dying for co-op Skyrim back in the day, considering I’ve never enjoyed exploring an open world as much as I have Elden Ring’s, since Skyrim.

Niall stayed in Castle Sol to protect his lord, although he ultimately failed in that duty, judging from the ghost you find after defeating Niall.
Digging into the knights of Castle Sol, we can get a bit more of a sense of what they're up to.
