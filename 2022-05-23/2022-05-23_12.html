The award-winning country artist and the pop titan collaborated on “Where We Started,” the title track of Rhett’s latest album:“Those days when you're brokenhearted/ And you're gettin' knocked down and you're sayin’/ ‘Don't you know how far we're gonna go just/ Look at the road and think about where we started/ Keep your eyes on me 'cause talk is cheap/ We're all we need, yeah/ Darlin', I know how far we're gonna go just/ Look at that road and think about where we started’”Rhett debuted Where We Started on April 1, marking the first of two albums that’s set to release this year.
