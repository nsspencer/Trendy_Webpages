     Summary: Thomas Rhett and Katy Perry performed their cross-genre duet for the first time on the American Idol stage during the Season 20 finale on Sunday night (May 22).
The award-winning country artist and the pop titan collaborated on “Where We Started,” the title track of Rhett’s latest album:“Those days when you're brokenhearted/ And you're gettin' knocked down and you're sayin’/ ‘Don't you know how far we're gonna go just/ Look at the road and think about where we started/ Keep your eyes on me 'cause talk is cheap/ We're all we need, yeah/ Darlin', I know how far we're gonna go just/ Look at that road and think about where we started’”Rhett debuted Where We Started on April 1, marking the first of two albums that’s set to release this year.
Country Again: Side B is due this fall.
His song with Perry is one of a few collaborations on the new project, and it seemed fitting… Previously, Rhett retweeted a message he shared on May 25, 2013: “Y’all have some pretty funny guilty pleasures.
Mine’s [Katy Perry] hands down.” On April 4, Rhett couldn’t help but notice, “this tweet aged well.”Watch their worldwide debut performance here:
