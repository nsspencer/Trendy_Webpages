     ‘Elvis’ Movie Soundtrack Includes Eminem, Stevie Nicks, Jack White &amp; More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The artist lineup for the highly anticipated Elvis soundtrack was revealed on Monday (May 23), and among those making a little less conversation, a little more action on the album are Eminem &amp; CeeLo Green, Stevie Nicks, Jack White, Tame Impala, Jazmine Sullivan, Gary Clark Jr. and many, many more.
The song interpolates Big Mama Thornton’s 1952 foundational rock and roll song “Hound Dog,” which was later famously recorded by Elvis Presley.
Maneskin‘s rendition of “If I Can Dream” was recently used in a teaser trailer for the movie.
The film’s release date was pushed back a number of times due to COVID-19, including after Tom Hanks, who plays Presley’s manager Colonel Tom Parker, contracted the virus in Australia, where he was filming the biopic.
“The film explores the life and music of Elvis Presley (Butler), seen through the prism of his complicated relationship with his enigmatic manager, Colonel Tom Parker (Hanks),” the film’s description reads.

     ‘Elvis’ Soundtrack Artists Revealed: Eminem, Jack White, Tame Impala, Stevie Nicks Will Be TCB
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The full artist lineup for the “Elvis” soundtrack has been revealed — although still not the actual tracks they’re performing — and among those takin’ care of business on the album are Eminem, Tame Impala, Stevie Nicks, Jack White and Jazmine Sullivan.
Top-billed in the graphic is Elvis Aaron Presley (middle name prominently included, although it was never part of his billing).
There haven’t been many advance reports from those who’ve seen the movie, but the Presley family has notably weighed in.
There’s a lot of family trauma and generational trauma that started around then for our family.
Austin captured that so beautifully.”Prior to that, Lisa Marie Presley had tweeted, “Let me tell you that it is nothing short of spectacular.
