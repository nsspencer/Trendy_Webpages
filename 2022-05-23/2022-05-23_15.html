     Top Gun 2: What Has Maverick Been Doing All This Time?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This article contains mild Top Gun: Maverick spoilers.
What does a man like Tom Cruise’s Lt. Pete Mitchell, aka ace Navy pilot “Maverick,” look like in his old age?
That is a question that would seemingly be posed by the prospect of a legacy sequel released 36 years after the original and iconic Top Gun.
And yet, the answer remains elusive in the final, and joyously satisfying, Top Gun: Maverick.
Yet while Cain might be ready to command a fleet, Maverick is still doing what he’s always done: pushing it to the limit and flying high above the danger zone.

     Review: ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ just might take your breath away
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CLEVELAND, Ohio -- “Top Gun” fans who waited (checks notes) 36 years for a sequel can breathe a sigh of relief.
“Top Gun: Maverick,” out Friday, is worth the wait, a nostalgia-filled, adrenalin rush full of high-flying action, stunning visuals and, surprisingly, heart.
The original “Top Gun” was style over substance, not much more than an MTV music video in search of a movie.
But none of that stops “Top Gun: Maverick” from being the kind of wildly entertaining, old-school blockbuster that summers and popcorn were made for.
“Top Gun: Maverick” is rated PG-13 and opens in theaters on Friday with preview screenings on Thursday night.

     Summary: NEW YORK (CNS) — Off they go into the wild blue yonder — again — in “Top Gun: Maverick” (Paramount), a rousing sequel to the 1986 blockbuster about one of the U.S. Navy’s elite flying squadrons and its gaggle of cocky fighter pilots.
After one mishap too many, however, Iceman returns Maverick to their shared starting point, the Navy training ground known as Top Gun — but this time as an instructor.
“Top Gun: Maverick” is supreme fun from beginning to end.

     'Top Gun: Maverick' is a blast of nostalgia, upgraded action scenes and emotion.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That “Top Gun: Maverick” works so well can surely be attributed to Tom Cruise, who created the title character, rule-floutin', death-cheatin’, heart-breakin’ pilot Pete Mitchell (call sign: Maverick).
“Top Gun: Maverick” hews to the structure of the first movie, punctuating scenes of rivalry, seduction and personal reckonings with increasingly difficult flight tests and simulated dogfights, the whole thing culminating in a genuinely spectacular, climactic real-time battle.
Tom Cruise still has the need for speed, reprising his role as US Naval Aviator Pete "Maverick" Mitchell in this sequel to 1986's "Top Gun."
That last call sign is just one example of the low-key humor that runs through “Top Gun: Maverick,” which gratifyingly never resorts to snark or smug winking.
Among its many virtues, most amazingly, “Top Gun: Maverick” doesn’t feel like a video game or a three-dimensional comic book or an ad for a theme park.

     ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ Set To Soar To $180M WW, Repping Best Global Start For Tom Cruise – Weekend Box Office
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Cruise attends the red carpet for the Japan Premiere of “Top Gun: Maverick” at Osanbashi Yokohama on May 24.
Note that start included Russia, where Top Gun 2 won’t fly, and China which isn’t in the mix this weekend.
We’ve been told there aren’t really any like-for-likes given the legacy factor of the Top Gun IP, but some are comparing to M:I – Fallout.
Italy was one of the territories that fired off sneaks last weekend, where Top Gun: Maverick shot to No.
M:I – Fallout did close to $50M in historical ticket sales there.
