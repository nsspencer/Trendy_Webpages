     As Monkeypox Cases Rise, Nations Are Urged to Examine Vaccine Stores
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States considered immunizing the entire population to protect against a terrorist attack using smallpox.
“Hopefully, presumably, monkeypox is still relatively rare right now, and a ring vaccination strategy may well be able to keep it completely at bay,” Dr. Hanage said.
Human monkeypox was first identified in 1970 in a 9-year-old boy in a region of the Democratic Republic of Congo where smallpox had been eliminated.
Monkeypox cases in the country have significantly increased in the decades since smallpox mass vaccination ended.
In 2003, the United States recorded dozens of monkeypox cases that were traced to infected pets.

     1 confirmed, 6 presumptive monkeypox cases in US, government releasing vaccines for exposed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The CDC said Monday that the government is in the process of releasing some vaccines from its national stockpile.
There is no need to vaccinate the general public against monkeypox, officials said.
Still, CDC officials cautioned that more cases are likely, and the agency is now raising awareness among men who identify as gay or bisexual.
An early cluster of monkeypox cases in London was among a nuclear family who lived in the same household.
"Anyone -- anyone can develop and spread monkeypox infection," Dr. John Brooks, medical epidemiologist, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention at the CDC, said.

The case is in an adult male with international travel in the past month to a country that has also reported monkeypox cases recently.
Initial testing confirming an orthopoxviral infection was completed on Monday, May 23, 2022, at the Washington State Public Health Laboratory.
“The public and healthcare providers should be aware of the growing international monkeypox outbreak,” said Dr. Jeff Duchin, Health Officer for Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County.
In King County, symptomatic patients can be evaluated in the Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County Sexual Health Clinic, open M/W/TH/F 7:30 am – 6:00 pm and Tuesday 9:30 am – 6:00 pm.

     Summary: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating four suspected cases of monkeypox in the United States.
The CDC is working to acquire and distribute a small amount of doses of monkeypox vaccine from the Strategic National Stockpile for certain high-risk individuals who have been in contact with cases.
The majority of current cases have been reported in men who have sex with other men.
Two raves held in Spain and Belgium among gay and bisexual men have been connected to the current cases.
“It’s not a situation where if you’re passing someone in the grocery store, you’re going to be at risk for monkeypox,” McQuiston said.

     Monkeypox Cases on the Rise: What to Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brook Mitchell/Getty Images Dozens of monkeypox cases have been reported in multiple countries in Europe, and the outbreak has since spread to North America and Australia.
The WHO says scientists have identified several animals as susceptible to the monkeypox virus, including rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, non-human primates, and other species.
As of May 21, the organization reported 92 laboratory-confirmed cases and 28 suspected cases of monkeypox from 12 Member States not endemic to the monkeypox virus, with no deaths yet reported.
“Uncertainty remains on the natural history of monkeypox virus, and further studies are needed to identify the exact reservoir(s) and how virus circulation is maintained in nature,” said the WHO .
Newman said most monkeypox cases resolve over time.

     Summary: So far, scientists have recorded more than 250 confirmed or suspected monkeypox cases, mainly in Europe, and are trying to determine if and how the cases might be connected.
CLOSER LOOK: Reports of rare monkeypox cases around the world raise concernThe CDC is concerned about the pace cases are developing worldwide and wants to raise awareness about possible symptoms without encouraging people to cancel events.
All of the current cases are mild and appear to be going away on their own, she said.
A person with an immunocompromising or skin condition is likely to take longer to bring a monkeypox infection under control, Brooks said.
Vaccines and treatmentsThe United States has stockpiles of vaccines to prevent smallpox, which should also be effective against monkeypox, McQuiston said.
