The club announced that Spurs are set to play Sevilla in the second match of the Coupang Play Series on Wednesday, July 13.
We can confirm we will face @SevillaFC in the second match of our pre-season tour of Korea this summer, supported by the Club’s Principal Partner, @AIAGroup_Press.
Spurs’ first preseason match in Korea will be against a Korean XI, dubbed “Team K-League” on Wednesday, July 13.

     ‘Now to think’: £27m Tottenham midfielder unsure about his future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Giovani Lo Celso has said on Instagram that he is going to think about his future now that his loan spell at Villarreal has finished.
Lo Celso joined La Liga club Villarreal on loan from Premier League outfit Tottenham in the January transfer window.
The 26-year-old’s loan spell at the Yellow Submarine has now finished, and the Argentina international midfielder will go back to Tottenham for next season.
Unai Emery’s side finished seventh in the La Liga table this season and could feature in the group stage of the Europa League next campaign.
The 26-year-old made 11 starts and five substitute appearances in La Liga for the Yellow Submarine.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the past few weeks, it’s been surmised that Gabriel Jesus was likely to leave Manchester City for opportunities at a different Premier League club.
However, the North London club that was most closely linked with the Brazilian was Arsenal, not Spurs.
However, the Telegraph is reporting that Jesus is a target for Tottenham this summer, with the club already having made contact with his agent, and the player being “aware” of Spurs’ interest.
But what Arsenal can’t offer (and Tottenham can!)
Gonna be a whole bunch of these kinds of stories in the next few weeks and months.

     Summary: It took a while to happen but Tottenham did eventually strike with a double raid on Juventus.
Both players have made a huge impact on this Tottenham squad and their importance was clear on Sunday.
Kulusevski went on to score again in the second half, curling a beautiful strike into the top corner of the net.
They note that Kulusevski was in ‘oblivion’ at Juventus but ‘as if by magic’ he has produced great performances whilst showcasing his technical and physical ability.
Kulusevski is also hailed for ‘exceptional growth’ at Tottenham whilst Tottenham are praised for taking advantage of his struggles at Juventus to land a great deal.

     Dier and Lloris call on Tottenham to ‘take advantage’ of Champions League qualification: ‘It’s in the club’s hands now’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur captain Hugo Lloris and defender Eric Dier have called on the club to take advantage of their Champions League qualification.
Spurs secured a top-four finish on the final day of the Premier League season, beating Norwich City 5-0 to finish fourth ahead of rivals Arsenal.
They have not competed in the Champions League since the 2019-20 campaign, when they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage by RB Leipzig.
Dier, who has been at the club since 2014, believes Tottenham must make the most of Champions League qualification.
“I think the club needs to take advantage of this moment, take advantage of this team and this manager,” he said.

     Summary: The Tottenham Hotspur hierarchy will tell Antonio Conte in the coming days that they intend to fully back him this summer if he stays at the club, The Athletic understands.
Chairman Daniel Levy is expected to offer Conte a clutch of new signings, including established, experienced players.
Instead, Conte has maintained that he will speak to Levy and managing director of football Fabio Paratici about his future once the season finishes.
With the campaign over, Conte is enjoying a holiday in Italy and will speak to Levy and Paratici in the coming days.
Conte has repeatedly asked for his employers to match his ambition, and that is precisely the case they will be making this week.

     Spurs Beat Arsenal to Top Four Spot, May Create Gap in EPL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the pressure was on, Arsenal went to Spurs and lost and then compounded that defeat by losing at Newcastle, while Spurs, who was four points behind with three games remaining, capitalized by beating Burnley.
Arsenal and Tottenham are both thought to be interested in signing Gabriel Jesus, who is likely to leave Manchester City this summer.
Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, is known to have been trying to build bridges with Pochettino, with a job swap a possibility.
Firstly, Arsenal’s record against top sides is shaky: nine points from 10 league games against other Big Six teams isn’t terrible, but all three wins came against opponents down on their luck.
When Arsenal was bottom of the table with no points from three games, this finish would have seemed a great achievement.

Conte has changed all that, and the former Juventus boss has been able to guide Tottenham back into the Champions League.

     Tottenham: Antonio Conte returning Spurs to the Champions League is a huge success, what comes next is harder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is a platform to build something on and it's a platform that Tottenham desperately needed to return to after missing out on Champions League play for two consecutive seasons.
When Nuno Espirito Santo was fired in November, months after he was hired to lead Spurs, this team could've gone plenty of different ways.
For now, despite their success, nothing is set in stone yet as Conte said after Spurs' 5-0 victory over Norwich City.
But he acknowledged the achievement of what the team has done saying, "It's very very difficult - to reach a place in the Champions League.
The team will need more depth not only for their return to Champions League but also since the Premier League will return to allowing five substitutes per game.

     Summary: Tottenham selling Tanguy Ndombele this summer is “on the cards”, according to journalist Pete O’Rourke.
With Lyon not expected to activate the Frenchman’s option to buy clause that was included in the loan deal, Ndombele will return to Tottenham this summer.
Hear more on The Football Terrace…Has Ndombele played his last game for Tottenham?
Unless something unexpected happens, then it’s hard to see a way back for Ndombele.
Where Ndombele, who earns £200,000 per-week, is playing his football next season remains anyone’s guess, but it’s unlikely to be at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
