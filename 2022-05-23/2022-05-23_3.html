     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Stan Szeto-USA TODAY SportsFormer Denver Broncos third-round pick Brendan Langley was involved in a fight with an airport employee and the video has gone viral.
Former Denver Broncos third-round pick Brendan Langley, now under contract with the Calgary Stampeders in the Canadian Football League, was involved in a fight at the airport recently and a video of the fight has been going viral on the internet.
The United employee comes up after getting hit by Langley and once again goes back to Langley like a woozy fighter trying to go one more round.
A longer video clip was also posted on Twitter showing Langley and the United employee getting physical for a bit before the clip that has gone viral.
It’s unclear as of the time of this post being written what led to the employee leaving his post and getting physical with Langley.
