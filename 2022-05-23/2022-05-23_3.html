     CFL's Calgary Stampeders investigating reports that a player was involved in brawl at Newark airport with airline employee
    </h2>

     Summary: (CNN) The Canadian Football League's Calgary Stampeders said they are investigating reports that player Brendan Langley was charged after a fight with a United Airlines employee at Newark Liberty International Airport that was partially caught on video, according to a team statement obtained by CNN.
"The Calgary Stampeders football club is aware of the reports concerning Brendan Langley," the Stampeders said in the statement.
CNN has reached out to Langley and the CFL with no response.
Earlier Monday, CNN spoke with both the Port Authority in Newark and United Airlines about a confrontation caught on video between a United Airlines employee and another man.
The video reviewed by CNN starts after the confrontation has begun and it is not apparent what instigated the fight.

     Former Denver Broncos draft pick involved in viral airport fight video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Stan Szeto-USA TODAY SportsFormer Denver Broncos third-round pick Brendan Langley was involved in a fight with an airport employee and the video has gone viral.
Former Denver Broncos third-round pick Brendan Langley, now under contract with the Calgary Stampeders in the Canadian Football League, was involved in a fight at the airport recently and a video of the fight has been going viral on the internet.
The United employee comes up after getting hit by Langley and once again goes back to Langley like a woozy fighter trying to go one more round.
A longer video clip was also posted on Twitter showing Langley and the United employee getting physical for a bit before the clip that has gone viral.
It’s unclear as of the time of this post being written what led to the employee leaving his post and getting physical with Langley.
