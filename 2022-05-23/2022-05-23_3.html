Both players have made a huge impact on this Tottenham squad and their importance was clear on Sunday.
Kulusevski went on to score again in the second half, curling a beautiful strike into the top corner of the net.
They note that Kulusevski was in ‘oblivion’ at Juventus but ‘as if by magic’ he has produced great performances whilst showcasing his technical and physical ability.
Kulusevski is also hailed for ‘exceptional growth’ at Tottenham whilst Tottenham are praised for taking advantage of his struggles at Juventus to land a great deal.

     Dier and Lloris call on Tottenham to ‘take advantage’ of Champions League qualification: ‘It’s in the club’s hands now’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur captain Hugo Lloris and defender Eric Dier have called on the club to take advantage of their Champions League qualification.
Spurs secured a top-four finish on the final day of the Premier League season, beating Norwich City 5-0 to finish fourth ahead of rivals Arsenal.
They have not competed in the Champions League since the 2019-20 campaign, when they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage by RB Leipzig.
Dier, who has been at the club since 2014, believes Tottenham must make the most of Champions League qualification.
“I think the club needs to take advantage of this moment, take advantage of this team and this manager,” he said.

     Reports: Tottenham to back Conte with six new summer signings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If the stories and reports coming out in the English football media one day after the end of the Premier League season are any indication, Tottenham Hotspur could have an extremely fun and active offseason.
Conte is already back in Italy after the conclusion of the Premier League season, one which he bootstrapped Spurs from somewhere around midtable to become one of the best clubs in England in the second half of the season.
The Telegraph states that Managing Director of Football Fabio Paratici will fly down next week for talks with Conte and to outline Spurs’ proposed plan of attack for the summer.
The next step is to show intent by making a few signings early in the window — the new Premier League season begins on Sat.
August 6 due to the winter World Cup in Qatar, while the transfer window doesn’t close until Monday, September 1.

     Summary: The Tottenham Hotspur hierarchy will tell Antonio Conte in the coming days that they intend to fully back him this summer if he stays at the club, The Athletic understands.
Chairman Daniel Levy is expected to offer Conte a clutch of new signings, including established, experienced players.
Instead, Conte has maintained that he will speak to Levy and managing director of football Fabio Paratici about his future once the season finishes.
With the campaign over, Conte is enjoying a holiday in Italy and will speak to Levy and Paratici in the coming days.
Conte has repeatedly asked for his employers to match his ambition, and that is precisely the case they will be making this week.

     Spurs Beat Arsenal to Top Four Spot, May Create Gap in EPL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When the pressure was on, Arsenal went to Spurs and lost and then compounded that defeat by losing at Newcastle, while Spurs, who was four points behind with three games remaining, capitalized by beating Burnley.
Arsenal and Tottenham are both thought to be interested in signing Gabriel Jesus, who is likely to leave Manchester City this summer.
Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, is known to have been trying to build bridges with Pochettino, with a job swap a possibility.
Firstly, Arsenal’s record against top sides is shaky: nine points from 10 league games against other Big Six teams isn’t terrible, but all three wins came against opponents down on their luck.
When Arsenal was bottom of the table with no points from three games, this finish would have seemed a great achievement.

     Tottenham: Antonio Conte returning Spurs to the Champions League is a huge success, what comes next is harder

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is a platform to build something on and it's a platform that Tottenham desperately needed to return to after missing out on Champions League play for two consecutive seasons.
When Nuno Espirito Santo was fired in November, months after he was hired to lead Spurs, this team could've gone plenty of different ways.
For now, despite their success, nothing is set in stone yet as Conte said after Spurs' 5-0 victory over Norwich City.
But he acknowledged the achievement of what the team has done saying, "It's very very difficult - to reach a place in the Champions League.
The team will need more depth not only for their return to Champions League but also since the Premier League will return to allowing five substitutes per game.

More infoTottenham boss Antonio Conte is reportedly set to be promised the six summer signings he desires, but could still quit the club as he considers whether to spend another year away from his family.
