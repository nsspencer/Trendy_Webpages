     City of Houston to announce website for all Juneteenth events commemorating federal holiday
    </h2>

     Summary: It was a measure meant to punish the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War and did not cover enslaved Africans in border states.It also failed to free those held in bondage in Texas.
That would not come until June 19, 1865, when Union General Gordon Granger landed in Galveston, Texas, and issued General Order #3.
Popular belief is that the enslaved Africans in Texas did not know about the Emancipation Proclamation until Granger's announcement.However, some historians have disputed that claim.In 2021, Juneteenth became a federal holiday.

"They started throwing things at the house and when they left, they took out the furniture and burned it and burned the house.
