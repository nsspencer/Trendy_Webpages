     Rain delays second half of Golden State Warriors-Dallas Mavericks game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS -- Golden State's Splash Brothers were trying not to get wet at the start of the second half Tuesday night as water leaked through the roof of the American Airlines Center, delaying Game 4 of the Western Conference finals between the Warriors and Mavericks by 16 minutes.
This was the second time water dripping through the American Airlines Center roof affected a Mavericks game.
It also delayed the start of a Timberwolves-Mavericks game by 15 minutes back on March 21.
The Mavericks led 62-47 at the half.
Once the game resumed, the Mavericks continued to build on their lead, jumping out to a 99-70 advantage by the end of the third quarter and going on to win 119-109.

I think our defense was amazing today," Luka said.
When asked how Dallas adjusted to Golden State's zone, Luka said, "It's different.
It will be tough for Dallas in Golden State, as the Warriors have been dominant on their home floor all season, but they are not ready to quit.

     Why Steve Kerr went back to Warriors starters late in Game 4 loss to Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the first three quarters of their Game 4 119-109 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night, the Warriors starters were about as ineffective as they could possibly be.
So Warriors coach Steve Kerr did what any coach would do, pulling his starters and putting in a bench unit aimed at soaking up minutes before moving on to the next game.
The unit of Jordan Poole, Damion Lee, Nemanja Bjelica, Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody played well.
The first question to Kerr from reporters after the game was about his decision not to stick with the guys that got the Warriors back in the game.
"Yeah, I mean, with about five minutes left, I think we cut it to 14 or so," Kerr said.

     Summary: DALLAS — The Warriors played with heavy hearts in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals Tuesday night just hours after a mass shooting at a Texas elementary school rocked the nation and renewed calls for gun control.
At least 19 children and two adults were killed and several others were wounded after an 18-year-old gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, about 350 miles south of Dallas, in what was the nation’s deadliest school shooting in almost a decade.
Many of the Warriors players, who are fathers, struggled to comprehend the pain the families of the victims were feeling and shared the fears many other parents had after hearing about the nation’s 27th school shooting this year.
So much so the Warriors star approached Kerr and gave him a head nod and firm handshake before tip-off.
“It was unspoken but I knew what he was expressing,” Kerr said after the game.
