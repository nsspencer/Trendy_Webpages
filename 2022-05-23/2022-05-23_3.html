     Is Walmart Juneteenth Ice Cream Real? Fact-Checking Company Website
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some of us celebrated that this culturally Black thing that we have known about for at least the last couple of decades was now being recognized on a national level.
But whether it’s real or not, Black people’s reaction to it is definitely real, and, it appears many of us are displeased.
Obviously, this is bigger than just ice cream.
I mean, what does Juneteenth mean in a country where every day is Columbus Day?
Some people think Black people’s complaints about Walmart’s alleged ice cream is another instance of us never being satisfied.

     Murals, tours and movies: City announces how Juneteenth will be celebrated across historic districts
    </h2>

     Summary: It was a measure meant to punish the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War and did not cover enslaved Africans in border states.It also failed to free those held in bondage in Texas.
That would not come until June 19, 1865, when Union General Gordon Granger landed in Galveston, Texas, and issued General Order #3.
Popular belief is that the enslaved Africans in Texas did not know about the Emancipation Proclamation until Granger's announcement.However, some historians have disputed that claim.In 2021, Juneteenth became a federal holiday.
My father came with a gun and police told them if he busted a cap they'd let the mob have us," Lee recalled.
"They started throwing things at the house and when they left, they took out the furniture and burned it and burned the house.

     Summary: But we just got Juneteenth recognized as a national holiday last year, commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African-American people.
Walmart wasted no time before trying to profit off Black people’s supposed “freedom” with Great Value Brand’s Juneteenth ice cream flavor?
(They would give us the most off-brand ice cream to commodify our liberation.)
But the outrageous “Black liberation” ice cream roll out, isn’t the only Juneteenth product brands are cooking up.
AdvertisementOn the contrary, there are many Black-owned alternatives to white corporate brands, such as Blissfully Southern’s Cream-a-licious red velvet and cheesecake ice cream, Miiriya, Free to Be Black’s Juneteenth t-shirts, and the entire Black-owned Juneteenth section on Etsy.

     Toledo City Council considers Juneteenth, Indigenous Peoples holidays

     Summary: Council will vote Tuesday on whether to replace Good Friday with Juneteenth as a paid holiday for city workers and replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day.
TOLEDO, Ohio — Toledo City Council is expected to vote Tuesday on a pair of proposals to change city-observed holidays.
The first measure would make Juneteenth a paid holiday for city employees, replacing Good Friday as a day off.
But here in Toledo, city council members, including Cerssandra Mcpherson, want to make the holiday the official 16th paid holiday for city employees, replacing Good Friday.
Council also consider changing Columbus Day to Indigenous People's Day during Tuesday's meeting.
