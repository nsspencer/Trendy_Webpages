     Cardinals DE J.J. Watt announces retirement following conclusion of 2022 NFL season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watt had 18.5 more sacks, 90 more QB hits and 51 more tackles for loss than any other player in the NFL in a four-season span from 2012-2015.
Watt was a relentless force in Houston, unblockable at the point of attack and able to manhandle offensive linemen.
At his peak, Watt single-handedly wrecked game plans and outright controlled the game, a mystifying accomplishment for a defensive lineman.
Watt will retire a three-time DPOY winner with five first-team All-Pro honors, five Pro Bowls.
He's a shoo-in for a gold jacket in five years (Watt is eligible for the Hall in 2028), as one of three players in NFL history to win DPOY three times -- Lawrence Taylor and Aaron Donald.

     Summary: A mortal lock: There's no other way to categorize it.
We could run through Brady's dizzying stats or his unparalleled longevity or team success, but by now you likely have most of it down by heart.
The Athletic's Zak Keefer recently relayed a great anecdote that Hall of Fame voter Mike Chappell shared when Chappell was presenting Peyton Manning's case to the other 49 HOF voters, before Manning made it in as part of the Class of 2021.
Chappell stood up in the room and said: "Peyton Manning.
When it's Tom's turn, it might suffice for his presenter to simply say: "Brady."
