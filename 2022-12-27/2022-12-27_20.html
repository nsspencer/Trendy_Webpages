     Sixers hoping to return to form after surprising loss to Washington Wizards: ‘We just didn’t have it’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid walks on the court during a game at the Wells Fargo Center on Dec. 21.
Harris and his 76ers teammates had suffered a 116-111 setback to the Washington Wizards at Capital One Arena in a game they had no business losing.
And you respect and honor every opponent.”The loss to the 14-21 Wizards was a reminder of what’s needed to win in the NBA.
The Sixers also had defensive shortcomings, especially in the first half as the Wizards shot 55.8%.
Well, I don’t know,” Embiid said of overlooking the Wizards.

     After loss to Wizards, Tobias Harris wants Sixers to learn from mistakes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — The Philadelphia 76ers had their eight-game winning streak snapped on Tuesday with a loss to the Washington Wizards created by a very disappointing effort.
The Sixers fell behind by double digits in the first half for the third straight game and weren’t able to recover this time.
However, Philadelphia let a Wizards team that was eight games under .500 entering the night hang around, and they took advantage.
These were not issues during the winning streak, but they are issues that have popped up in the past and this loss was a reminder of them.
“Obviously, there’s no moral victories in NBA, but we can learn something from this game,” Harris added.

     76ers vs. Wizards: Doc Rivers Addresses Team’s ‘Cocky’ Mindset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a matchup with the New York Knicks, the Sixers trailed for three-quarters of the game.
It was the second-straight game the Sixers trailed for the majority of the matchup before constructing a successful comeback.
The physicality at the level of the screen, guarding our own man, that’s how we’ve been starting.
In the first half of action, Philadelphia trailed by as many as 15 points.
While it was a humbling moment for Philadelphia, a late December loss in Washington shouldn’t affect the confidence of the squad.

     Joel Embiid's MVP case continues to build, but late-game offense haunts Sixers as winning streak ends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Embiid has a long way to go to catch A.I., who totaled 76 40-point games in a Sixers uniform.
Georges Niang, who has been a consistent 3-point shooter all season (43 percent), went just 1 of 7 from deep.
In clutch minutes, categorized as a game being within five points during the final five minutes, the Sixers entered Tuesday night with the 24th-ranked offense in the league.
But neither could the Sixers, and that includes Embiid, who had a pair of costly turnovers and a missed free throw on high-leverage possessions.
But it should be noted that the Sixers' win streak didn't exactly come against the stiffest competition.

     Summary: We put no defense into the game until the second half, and we had to do zone to do that.
We let them hang around from the beginning of the game — something that’s been (happening) the last three games.
Defensively, we just haven’t been there, so we’ve got to be better.”As his Sixers tenure has progressed, Tobias Harris has steadily improved on the defensive end of the floor.
Here’s Harris:“Obviously we’ve been having really good games with good flow.
But the slow starts are definitely a concerning pattern we’ve seen crop up throughout the season.

     Sixers at Wizards: Sixers can't quite come back again, winning streak ends at eight games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Wizards also helped fuel the Sixers’ transition game by committing six turnovers in a little over five minutes.
The Wizards built their lead to 60-46 late in the second quarter on a top-of-the-key Porzingis three against the Sixers’ zone.
However, Rivers inserted Reed for Embiid with 33.4 seconds remaining in the second period, presumably wanting to ensure Embiid didn't get a third foul.
Rivers didn't see size as a valid excuse for the Sixers again falling behind in the first half and again having defensive rebounding struggles.
Harden and Embiid each made aggressive, impressive plays on both ends of the court during an immediate Sixers run in response.
