     GOP in disarray! MTG bashes Tulsi Gabbard over George Santos interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., criticized former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard — now a Fox News host —for giving embattled GOP Rep.-elect George Santos "zero grace" in a recent interview during which Gabbard questioned Santos' integrity over extensive fabrications on his résumé.
Gabbard asked Santos Tuesday evening.
During the interview, Gabbard also questioned Santos about representing himself as an "American Jew" and saying that he had "been to Israel numerous times for educational, business and leisurely trips."
"Not being raised a practicing Jew, I've always joked with friends and circles, even within the campaign, I'd say, guys, I'm 'Jew-ish.'
I think we Republicans should give George Santos a chance and see how he legislates and votes, not treat him the same as the left is."

     Summary: “You’ve apologized, you said you’ve made mistakes, but you’ve outright lied.
“We can have this discussion that’s going to go way above the American people’s head,” Santos said.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had applauded Santos’ election to Congress for contributing to the largest Republican Jewish caucus in more than 24 years.
But McCarthy has thus far stayed quiet on the new revelations about Santos — who has publicly voiced his support for McCarthy’s potential House speakership.
Santos has seen some pushback from the GOP, though, with the Republican Jewish Coalition on Tuesday denouncing him and his lies in a statement .
