    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Make no mistake, the Guaranteed Rate Bowl has plenty of reasons for Wisconsin fans to be glued to their televisions on Tuesday night.
Wisconsin and Oklahoma State both underwhelmed compared to preseason expectations.
Oklahoma State was an inch away from representing the Big 12 in the CFP this time last year.
Much like Wisconsin, Oklahoma State will be starting fresh at quarterback now that Spencer Sanders is in the transfer portal.

     Wisconsin vs Oklahoma State Odds, Pick | Our Guaranteed Rate Bowl Bet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wisconsin vs Oklahoma State OddsTuesday’s bowl slate will conclude in Phoenix, Arizona, as the Wisconsin Badgers take on the Oklahoma State Cowboys in the Guaranteed Rate Bowl.
Similarly, Oklahoma State lost its final two contests to finish at a disappointing 7-5.
Both Wisconsin and Oklahoma State have taken major hits in the transfer portal and will look different on Tuesday as a result.
This leaves a huge hole for an Oklahoma State offense that relied heavily on its passing attack.
Ultimately, Wisconsin will have more key pieces available against an Oklahoma State team that has lost its most valuable asset in Sanders.

     Oklahoma State vs. Wisconsin updates: Live NCAA Football game scores, results for Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Oklahoma State Cowboys and the Wisconsin Badgers will compete for holiday cheer in the Guaranteed Rate Bowl on Tuesday at Chase Field at 10:15 p.m.
Both teams took a loss in their last game, so they'll have plenty of motivation to get the 'W.'
Oklahoma State entered their contest against the West Virginia Mountaineers four weeks ago without any home losses -- but there's a first time for everything.
The Cowboys were within striking distance but couldn't close the gap as they fell 24-19 to West Virginia.
Wisconsin took a 23-16 hit to the loss column.
