     NBA Twitter Roasts Lakers for Turnovers, Sloppy Play in Loss vs. Jimmy Butler, Heat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeff Haynes/NBAE via Getty ImagesThe Los Angeles Lakers fell to the Miami Heat 112-98 in the second game of a back-to-back on Wednesday night and fell to 14-21 on the season.
LeBron James had to shoulder much of the load on Wednesday in Anthony Davis' continued absence, but it wasn't enough as turnovers proved costly in the team's defeat.
Had the Lakers not allowed 31 points off 24 turnovers, they might have won their second straight game.
NBA Twitter is now roasting the team for those turnovers and its sloppy performance on Wednesday night.
The Lakers have struggled all season, and they likely won't show much improvement unless some roster additions are made ahead of the trade deadline.

"I'm a winner, and I want to win and give myself a chance to win and still compete for championships," James said.
"I think about how much of the world I'm going to see when I'm done playing the game."

“We did a lot of things we needed to cleanup ourselves, and it was more about us.”The Lakers countered Orlando’s length by scrapping on the glass, outrebounding the Magic 46-37.
“It’s contagious, like you saw tonight.”BACK-TO-BACKFor the fifth time this season, the Lakers are in the midst of a back-to-back set of games, with Miami awaiting.
The Heat, meanwhile, are 3-0 with a rest advantage against a team that played the previous night.

But how we get better from game to game,” he said.
I think about that I don’t want to finish my career playing at this level from a team aspect.
Only three rotation players on the team have a positive plus-minus rating on the season —Austin Reaves, Davis and James.
“Let me be abundantly clear: We have one of the great players in LeBron James to ever play the game, and he committed to us on a long-term contract, a three-year contract.
