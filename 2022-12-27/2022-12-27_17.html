    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

     American Idol's Paula Abdul Gets Called Out For Photoshop Fail After Fans Accuse 60-Year-Old Of Looking Like A Teenager
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That appeared to be the case with Paula Abdul's latest photos, which the original American Idol judge posted after attending Kathy Hilton's annual Christmas party, but fans clocked it right away.
@savannahmccoy93The TV personality wasn’t fooling people on social media who noticed right away she looked different in the photos than she does in real life.
Many thought Abdul looked unrecognizable and took to the comment section to share their distaste for the photoshop fail.
Abdul is an idol in her own right to many people, so there was also frustration regarding her recent social media post.
The amount of editing here is embarrassingly obvious @marindasanchezWhile it was disappointing for fans to see Paula Abdul change her appearance for social media, it goes to show that anyone, even the ridiculously fabulous singer and dancer, can get self-conscious about appearances!
