Jeff Moore/ZUMA WireHaving been born in the Marley family, which includes Ziggy, Sharon and Cedella Marley, Jo Mersa was no stranger to music from a very young age.
And it wouldn't be long until Jo Mersa was putting out his own tracks.
That debut EP would not be the last work Jo Mersa would put out.
