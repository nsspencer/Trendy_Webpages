     Luka Doncic Records Historic 60-Point Triple-Double in Epic Comeback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was the first 60-point, 20-rebound triple-double in NBA history, and set a new franchise record for most points in a single game.
Donƒçiƒá was already having a banner night when he went to the free throw line with four seconds remaining in regulation.
Trailing by two with only one free throw left, he intentionally missed the shot, then corralled the rebound after a deflection and made an acrobatic putback to tie the game at 115 apiece.
It‚Äôs the first win by an NBA team in the last 20 seasons in such a scenario, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information.
He went 16-for-22 from the free throw line, and is now the youngest player in league history (23 years and 302 days) to record a 50-point triple-double.

     Luka Doncic destroys Knicks in unprecedented fashion: Seven numbers to know from Mavericks star's MVP night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This marks the first 60-point, 20-rebound triple-double in NBA history, and just the second 60-point triple-double of any kind, joining James Harden's 60-11-10 line from a 2018.
Game Score reflects the full box score in identifying the best single-game performances.
The most points Wilt ever scored in a game in which he also tallied 20 rebounds was 53.
I know records are made to be broken and all, but a 60-point, 20-rebound triple-double could feasibly stand forever.
Is this showing enough to move Doncic to the front of a crowded early MVP race?
