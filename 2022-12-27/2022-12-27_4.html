     Cardinals DE J.J. Watt announces retirement following conclusion of 2022 NFL season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watt had 18.5 more sacks, 90 more QB hits and 51 more tackles for loss than any other player in the NFL in a four-season span from 2012-2015.
Watt was a relentless force in Houston, unblockable at the point of attack and able to manhandle offensive linemen.
At his peak, Watt single-handedly wrecked game plans and outright controlled the game, a mystifying accomplishment for a defensive lineman.
Watt will retire a three-time DPOY winner with five first-team All-Pro honors, five Pro Bowls.
He's a shoo-in for a gold jacket in five years (Watt is eligible for the Hall in 2028), as one of three players in NFL history to win DPOY three times -- Lawrence Taylor and Aaron Donald.
