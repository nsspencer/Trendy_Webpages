     Summary: "Unfortunately, this Polar Vortex forced Greta and the gang to have to reschedule their Global Warming meeting," reads the post's caption.
But the article shown here is satirical, and USA TODAY found no evidence of any upcoming conference featuring Thunberg – canceled or otherwise.
The satirical article claims the canceled global warming conference was sponsored by the International Global Warming Trust, an organization that doesn't exist.
This is not the first time climate change skeptics have suggested cold weather proves global warming is not real.
Our rating: SatireBased on our research, we rate SATIRE the claim that Thunberg's global climate conference was canceled because of subarctic temperatures.
