     Is ‘Escape From Tarkov’ down?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Realistic shooter Escape From Tarkov today received a progression wipe, resetting progress for all players.
Unfortunately, it seems players are unable to get into game currently, with many players – including NME writers – getting a POST error.
Streams are currently live on Twitch, so it’s possible that it’s affecting a small proportion of players, too.
Generally, developer Battlestate Games moves quickly on fixing problems so it’s expected that the issue will resolve within an hour or two.
AdvertisementFor anyone that can get in, Escape From Tarkov‘s 0.13 patch adds the Streets of Tarkov map, grenade launchers, a score of other weapons and even new combat stims.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Credit: Battlestate GamesThe 0.13 update patch notes for Escape From Tarkov have been released, revealing that the wipe is now here along with the addition of the much-anticipated Streets of Tarkov map.
The patch notes were released as the game was taken offline earlier today for the Battlestate Games team to release the 0.13 update, bringing with it the start of the new wipe.
Obviously, the big new addition with the 0.13 update is the new Streets of Tarkov map, which was shown off in the pre-patch trailer earlier this week.
This update adds a part of the city of Tarkov, located at the intersection of Primorsky Avenue and Klimov Street,” reads the patch notes.
Rounding out the patch notes are details on some improvements to custom games, some hideout additions and of course a load of bug fixes.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Battlestate Games wants to thank its community for playing Escape From Tarkov repeatedly.
The humble gesture, as usual, is in collaboration with Twitch, which should spike the Tarkov viewership by quite a lot.
Twitch Drop events in the Tarkov universe are ENORMOUSLY HUGE, and it’s undoubtedly considered one of the most exciting events by the whole Escape From Tarkov community.
The only downside of this event could be insane server lag, which has been a cause during the previous Twitch drops event.
This time, the New Year’s events will be held from December 29, 2022 16:00 MSK to January 7, 2023 16:00 MSK.
