     Summary: Cannon/APLAS VEGAS (AP) — Top officials in Las Vegas expect the guestlist for “America's Party 2023” to surpass 400,000 people this year, even as rain forecast throughout Saturday night could put a damper on New Year's Eve celebrations, including the iconic midnight fireworks show over the Strip.
If Clark County officials pull the plug on the annual eight-minute pyrotechnic show, it would mark the first weather-related cancellation in the event's 22-year history.
The show was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

     Summary: Paul SzydelkoIt's no surprise that Las Vegas tops the list of specific locations leisure travelers are most excited to visit in 2023, according to a survey released this month by Morning Consult, a decision intelligence company.
The 17,500-seat theater, which cost in excess of $2 billion to build, will host custom-made live and/or pretaped attractions, musical residencies, corporate events and e-sports.
A 67-story shell of a building on the northern part of Las Vegas Strip for more than a decade, the 3,700-key Fontainebleau Las Vegas has promised a late-2023 debut.
The Plaza's reimagining of its facade downtown will be completed in 2023, and rooms are being renovated at both Wynn Las Vegas and New York-New York.
So hopefully, that's a good sign [going into 2023]," Belarmino said.
