     Summary: WASHINGTON, DC - Congressman Jamie Raskin (MD-08) today released the following statement.
“After several days of tests, I have been diagnosed with Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma, which is a serious but curable form of cancer.
I am about to embark on a course of chemo-immunotherapy on an outpatient basis at Med Star Georgetown University Hospital and Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.
In addition to destroying cancer cells, chemotherapy impairs natural antibodies and undermines the body’s immune system.
I am advised that it also causes hair loss and weight gain (although I am still holding out hope for the kind that causes hair gain and weight loss).

     Rep. Jamie Raskin says he’s been diagnosed with lymphoma
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin said Wednesday that he has a type of lymphoma that’s a “serious but curable form of cancer” and he is beginning several months of treatment.
He was the lead impeachment manager when the House impeached Trump one week after the attack, and he currently sits on the House committee investigating the siege.
This is the second time the Maryland Democrat has been diagnosed with cancer, as he previously battled colorectal cancer in 2010.
Tommy’s death came just a week before the insurrection, and Raskin had brought his daughter and son-in-law to the Capitol that day.
Through tears, Raskin spoke about their ordeal as he argued for Trump’s conviction in the Senate impeachment trial.

“I plan to get through this and, in the meantime, to keep making progress every day in Congress for American democracy,” Raskin said in the statement.
It can be cured in about half of all patients, but it largely depends on factors including the stage when the disease is caught, the society notes.
