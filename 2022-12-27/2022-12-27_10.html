     Stan Lee Documentary Will Arrive On Disney+ In 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today would have been Marvel Comics leader Stan Lee’s 100th birthday.
To celebrate, Disney+ has announced that an original documentary on the man will arrive at some time in 2023.
Lee died at age 95 in 2018.
As a writer and editor for Marvel Comics, Lee became the most famous comic book creator in the history of the medium — he was the only creator in the field whose fame rivaled that of the characters he created.
It was the 1960s, however, when Lee minted his reputation and tapped into a vein of pop-culture creativity that made history.
