     Luka Doncic destroys Knicks in unprecedented fashion: Seven numbers to know from Mavericks star's MVP night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This marks the first 60-point, 20-rebound triple-double in NBA history, and just the second 60-point triple-double of any kind, joining James Harden's 60-11-10 line from a 2018.
Game Score reflects the full box score in identifying the best single-game performances.
The most points Wilt ever scored in a game in which he also tallied 20 rebounds was 53.
I know records are made to be broken and all, but a 60-point, 20-rebound triple-double could feasibly stand forever.
Is this showing enough to move Doncic to the front of a crowded early MVP race?
