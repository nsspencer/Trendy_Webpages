     Super Bowl bonus: How much extra money do the winners and losers make?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The agreement stipulates players on the winning team earn an extra $157,000 for playing in the Super Bowl, while players on the losing team earn $82,000.
Players are set to receive their Super Bowl bonus pay within 15 day of the big game, according to the agreement.
By the 2030-31 football season (the last seasons covered in the most recent bargaining agreement), the Super Bowl winners will each take home an extra $228,000.
NFL players also get paid extra for playing in other playoff games or the Pro Bowl, but each of those extra payments is smaller than the Super Bowl bonus.
The 2023 Super Bowl kicks off at 6:30 Eastern Time at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.
