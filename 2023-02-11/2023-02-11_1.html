“The fact that the team I grew up with is the first Super Bowl I’m doing, I mean I’d be crazy not to enjoy that.”It’s Burkhardt and Olsen’s first Super Bowl together, and it could also be their last.
AdvertisementESPN also is broadcasting the Super Bowl, but only for international fans in Australia and New Zealand.
Since 2010, the longest Super Bowl remains Super Bowl XLVII in 2013 between the 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens, which lasted four hours and 14 minutes because of a 34-minute blackout in the Superdome in New Orleans.
Even Wawa will air a Super Bowl spot, though it’s only slated to appear in the Philadelphia area.
