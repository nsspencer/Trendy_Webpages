     What Do We Know About Marburg Virus Disease?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The World Health Organization announced that Equatorial Guinea confirmed its first outbreak of Marburg virus disease, after one sample tested positive.
Here is what the scientific community has learned so far about Marburg virus disease.
TaxonomyMarburg virus disease affects both people and non-human primates, and is caused by a genetically unique animal-borne RNA virus of the filovirus family (the same family as the Ebola virus).
IncubationAccording to the CDC, the incubation period for Marburg virus disease is 2 to 21 days.
TreatmentThere are no vaccines or antiviral treatments approved to treat Marburg virus disease.

     Marburg virus: What you need to know about the disease outbreak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is also assisting officials in Cameroon and Gabon to prepare for rapidly detecting, isolating and providing care to people who may contract Marburg virus.
About 50 per cent of people with Marburg virus die from the disease, though fatality rates can range from 24 to 88 per cent depending on the virus strain.
Marburg virus belongs to the same family of viruses as Ebola and causes similar symptoms such as severe fatigue, headache and haemorrhaging.
There is no vaccine or approved treatment for Marburg virus, although staying hydrated through drinking or receiving fluids intravenously improves survival.
“Any decision on trials of [Marburg virus] vaccines and therapeutics will be made by national authorities and researchers in Equatorial Guinea,” said Ghebreyesus.

     Summary: In February, World Health Organization officials confirmed an outbreak in Equatorial Guinea of the deadly Marburg virus, a highly infectious disease in the same family as the virus that causes Ebola.
What is the Marburg virus and where did it come from?
Marburg virus causes the Marburg Virus Disease, formerly known as Marburg hemorrhagic fever.
Serological studies have also revealed evidence of past Marburg virus infection in Nigeria.
Studies done in Nigeria in the the 1980s and more recently in the 1990s provide evidence of possible previous infections with Marburg virus – or a related virus – in certain Nigerian populations.

     Summary: Marburg virus particles in infected tissue.
The virus causes a deadly disease characterized by haemorrhagic fever.Credit: AMI Images/Science Photo LibraryHealth officials worldwide are sprinting to test whether experimental vaccines can protect against a deadly illness, after Equatorial Guinea confirmed its first outbreak of Marburg virus disease on 13 February.
This makes it larger than many of the 16 Marburg outbreaks that have previously been detected, Edmunds tells Nature.
Challenging logisticsAt this week’s WHO meeting, officials discussed the practicalities of testing Marburg virus vaccines in Equatorial Guinea.
Monkey studies suggest that all the leading candidates offer strong protection against Marburg virus disease.

     Marburg Virus Outbreak: What to Know About the Signs and Symptoms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Equatorial Guinea confirmed its first-ever outbreak of Marburg virus disease, according to the World Health Organization, with at least nine deaths caused by the Ebola-related virus.
What is Marburg virus disease?
Marburg virus disease is a “rare but severe hemorrhagic fever” caused by Marburg virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC.)
The first known outbreaks of Marburg virus disease occurred in 1967 in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany; and in Belgrade, Serbia.
The WHO says monoclonal antibodies being developed or antivirals that have been used in clinical trials for Ebola virus disease could also potentially be tested for Marburg virus disease.
