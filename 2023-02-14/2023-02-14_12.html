     Kelsea Ballerini Delivers Country Music’s Most Single-Minded D-I-V-O-R-C-E Record Ever With ‘Rolling Up the Welcome Mat’: Album Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The only thing she’s got dibs on in “Rolling Up the Welcome Mat” is filing court papers.
And it’s fairly shocking — in a good way — to hear her baring her post-marital soul on record so soon after seemingly placing limits on how far what she was going through at the time needed to make its way into her music.
Even those three albums, though, had at least a handful of tracks about something other than a triggering split.
And the Chicks and Pearson albums found much of their power in songs wreaking some vengeance on allegedly cheating ways.
That view is of the one thing that is more ubiquitous now in downtown Nashville than pedal taverns: an unfinished skyscraper.
