In this extremely difficult context, in addition to the short-term interventions needed to cope with the current crises, the Government has proposed to define a medium- and long-term development vision, in order to strengthen our resilience to future crises and create the basis for a sustainable and inclusive development of the country.

     Moldova briefly shuts airspace after report of balloon-like object
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CHISINAU, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Moldova briefly closed its air space on Tuesday to investigate reports of a balloon-like object in the sky, a day after the small east European country accused Russia of plotting to bring down its government.
Moldova's civil aviation authority said it acted after receiving a defence ministry report that a small object resembling a weather balloon had been seen over the north of the country, close to the border with Ukraine.
In a statement, it said that "given the weather conditions and the impossibility of observing and identifying the object and its flight path," the airspace had been closed.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week his country had uncovered a Russian intelligence plan "for the destruction of Moldova".
Moldova said on Feb. 10 a Russian missile had violated its airspace during an attack on Ukrainian infrastructure and summoned the Russian ambassador to protest.

     Moldova Closed Its Airspace For 3+ Hours Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Airspace disputesFlag carrier Air Moldova was the first to confirm the airspace closure, reaching out to its customers via Facebook to warn of potential disruption.
The CAA did not initially disclose the reason for the airspace closure, leading to speculation amid heightened tensions between Chișinău and Moscow.
Neighboring Romania has also found itself on the edge of the dispute, with both missiles avoiding its airspace by just 22 miles.
Moldova previously halted civilian air traffic for several weeks following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.
