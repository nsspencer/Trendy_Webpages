     When is the Next CPI Report?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "When is the next CPI report?"
That's why the Consumer Price Index or CPI report has become pretty much the star of the economic data calendar.
The CPI report is broken down into many subcategories, but the two main ones you'll hear most about on CPI day are headline CPI and core CPI.
That would represent a slowdown from the 6.4% increase in prices seen in the January CPI report.

The food index jumped by 0.5% in January with the energy index rose by 2%.
Food inflation has been stubborn about falling, with prices soaring by 10.1% year-over-year in January.
Futures were mixed following the CPI report.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The consumer price index, which measures a broad basket of common goods and services, rose 0.5% in January, which translated to an annual gain of 6.4%.
Rising shelter costs accounted for about half the monthly increase, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in the report.
Energy also was a significant contributor, up 2% and 8.7%, respectively, while food costs rose 0.5% and 10.1%, respectively.
Rising prices meant a loss in real pay for workers.
The central bank has hiked its benchmark interest rate eight times since March 2022 as inflation rose to its highest level in 41 years last summer.

     Summary: The January CPI report released Tuesday revealed that inflation continued to cool in January, albeit by not quite as much as economists had forecast.
Economists were looking for the annual inflation rate to slow to 6.2% last month.
Markets gave the CPI report tepid applause, with the major benchmarks reacting to the news with gains.
CPI Report: The Experts Weigh In(Image credit: Getty Images)"This inflation print served as a reminder to investors that the path to lower inflation is not as clear cut as previously thought and it is too early for the Fed to declare victory on inflation.
Used-vehicle, apparel, and service prices contributed to elevated core inflation and more expensive gas prices kept headline CPI higher."

     US CPI Report Shows Sticky Inflation is Back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the January CPI report, inflation remains well above the Fed target and the pace of declines in the inflation has slowed significantly.
In addition, much of the attention hasn’t been on the January CPI report itself but on the picture painted by routine revisions to 2022′s inflation data.
A largely as-expected January CPI reportThe January CPI report itself came in fairly close to consensus forecasts, but it’s the more recent trend and the details under the hood that are attracting attention.
Core CPI rose 5.6% year over year for the smallest reading of its kind since December 2021.
In January, energy prices rose 2.0% over the month as gasoline prices rose 2.4% and utility (piped) gas services prices rose 6.7%.
