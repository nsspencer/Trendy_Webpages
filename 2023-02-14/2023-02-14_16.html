    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: youtube.comAs a Kansan who herself moved to the UK at one point, I relate deeply to Ted Lasso’s feel-good fish-out-of-water comedy that’s less about a soccer (sorry, FOOTBALL) team and more about life — as well as the initial British disdain for my Midwestern optimism.
And after two seasons, the show is coming back on Apple TV for a third season (sorry, SERIES).
If you’ve got it on your must-watch list, we have all the intel on how you can stream it below.
