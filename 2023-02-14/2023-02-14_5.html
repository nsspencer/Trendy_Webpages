     What’s known about the toxic plume from the Ohio train derailment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border, has left residents uncertain and fearful about their town and the toxic mess that raises questions about the area’s water and soil.
An Ohio town is reckoning with the aftermath of a train derailment that unleashed highly toxic chemicals into the air, water and ground on Feb. 3, causing a massive fire, displacing residents and threatening public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency has said the air is safe to breathe and Norfolk Southern, the rail company, has pledged to clean up.
Without the full extent of contamination known, however, environmental advocates have questioned the response, and Pennsylvania Gov.
Josh Shapiro has said Norfolk Southern mismanaged its response to the disaster.

     Ohio train derailment: Governor says water in East Palestine safe to drink
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Water is pumped into a creek for aeration in East Palestine, Ohio, on Feb. 14.
Mike DeWine (R) said Wednesday that water in East Palestine's municipal system is safe to drink, nearly two weeks after a train carrying hazardous materials derailed in the area.
Driving the news: The train's derailment caused a fire and raised concerns about toxic fumes and water contamination from spilled materials.
The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency is "confident that the municipal water is safe to drink" after the latest water testing results showed "no detection of contaminants," DeWine tweeted Wednesday.

     The Ohio Train Derailment Created a Perfect TikTok Storm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in a small town in eastern Ohio on February 3, reports soon appeared in national news outlets.
Officials evacuated the region and began what they called a controlled release of chemicals from the train cars.
That changed after Nick Drombosky, an engineer and entrepreneur who has made a hobby of studying industrial accidents, gave a science lesson on TikTok.
But the train derailment disaster has particularly resonated on social media.
Some have suggested the US media’s massive focus on the Chinese spy balloon was a calculated misdirect, pulling attention away from the train derailment.

     Frustration builds over response to Ohio train derailment as officials urge patience
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Locals and activists say they have since received mixed messages from both federal and state officials about the safety of the area.
Asked about the seeming mixed message, DeWine responded that officials remain optimistic but cannot be sure until testing is completed.
I think that we have deployed lots of assets from the very beginning.”However, Regan echoed DeWine’s recommendation that residents drink bottled water in the meantime.
“They’re worried about their soil, they’re worried about the water, they’re worried about the chemicals, they’re worried that they’ve been breathing it.
… [They’re] worried for their animals, they’re worried for the future outcome, and nobody can seem to tell them anything.”
