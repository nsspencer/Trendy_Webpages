     Jason Sudeikis and Olivia Wilde's former nanny sues alleging wrongful termination
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The former live-in nanny to actors Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis is alleging that the pair terminated her as retaliation after she sought help for depression and anxiety amid their tumultuous split.
Genaro alleges that Sudeikis often spoke about Wilde to her after Wilde's "abrupt" departure from the family's home in November 2020, which led to her feeling pressure to "pick sides" between the couple.
Her duties as nanny were also "increased exponentially" after Wilde left, Genaro alleges, which led her to speak to Wilde in a private conversation that was then relayed to Sudeikis.
The Daily Mail reported in October on alleged details of the couple’s breakup, using an unnamed nanny as their source.
Sudeikis denied having any knowledge of when or where the legal documents would be served to Wilde.

     Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis sued by ex-nanny who dished about breakup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis are being sued by a nanny who got caught up in — and was fired during — the messy breakup of their relationship.
In the lawsuit, Genaro alleges she told Sudeikis in mid-January about her “anxiety, stress and physical pain” related to their breakup.
A day later, her osteopath advised an anxiety-ridden Genaro to require three days of “radio silence” from all parties, sharing that information with the therapist who told Sudeikis, the lawsuit says.
Sudeikis and Wilde had been dating since late 2011, got engaged shortly after the 2012 holidays, and share children Otis, 8, and Daisy, 6.
“I was caught off guard because I lived with them and was around them and I never saw any of this happen,” the nanny told the outlet.

     Summary: Photo: Lars Niki/Getty Images for The Academy Of SciencesFor the past few months, Olivia Wilde has been embroiled in, well, a lot of drama.
The lawsuit appears to come from the same woman who anonymously described details of their breakup to the Daily Mail in October.
Following the October Daily Mail report, Wilde seemed to lean into the theatrics of it all by posting a salad recipe from Nora Ephron’s divorce novel, Heartburn.
Several months later, Wilde appears to be at it again.
