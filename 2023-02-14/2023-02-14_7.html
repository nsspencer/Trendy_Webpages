     ‘Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania’ Has Marvel’s Second-Ever Rotten Review Score
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That was my first thought when I saw the review scores rolling in for Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, the third Ant-Man movie, but a seemingly important one to set up the MCU’s Phase 4 villain, Kang.
As it stands, with 140 reviews in, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has 53% on Rotten Tomatoes.
That’s a dismal score for an MCU feature, and marks only the second time that an MCU movie has had a “rotten” (below 60%) score on the site, the first time being Eternals in 2021.
They were never really considered top-tier Marvel movies but this is a huge drop.
This is contrast to Eternals, the other “bad” Marvel film that I’d argue was better than critics said, and there, the visuals were rather fantastic.

     'Ant-Man and the Wasp' gets 'Avengers' big for 'Quantumania' with 'epic' supervillain Kang

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marvel’s third “Ant-Man” film breaks its own quirky heist-movie mold with “Quantumania,” courtesy of an uncharted fantasy world, a fearsome supervillain and, for star Paul Rudd, a revamped rhythm.
When shrinking superhero Scott Lang (Rudd) meets Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) in the subatomic Quantum Realm in the first scenes the actors filmed together, “the beats per minute felt different,” Rudd says.
Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer coupling gets the spotlightIn 2018’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” Hank and Janet were reunited after she spent 30 years stuck in the Quantum Realm.
Every time she reprises the role, "I feel like I have to start from scratch because she's so different,” Lilly says.
She is content and full of peace and love in this.”Hope is using her dad’s technology to save the world in her own way, before she gets sucked into the Quantum Realm.

     'Ant-Man: Quantumania' Review: Paul Rudd Coasts in Breezily Bizarre MCU Film
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's time for another Marvel movie, and I guess it's Ant-Man's turn.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is in theaters Friday, Feb. 17.
Kathryn Newton plays the now-teenaged Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, and in the quantum realm they encounter William Jackson Harper, Katy O'Brian and Bill Murray (yes, that Bill Murray).
Cassie's signal to the microscopic quantum realm kicks off the story as the Ant-family is sucked into this strange kingdom, like another planet on the head of a pin.
Much more focus is given to the villain of the piece, Kang, another miniaturized exile to the quantum realm played by Jonathan Majors.

     Summary: DisneyAre the pint-sized heroes of Disney's "Ant-Man and the Wasp in Quantumania" enough to take on the newest — and baddest — villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe?
Marvel Studios' "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania."
"Ant-Man and the Wasp in Quantumania" held a 53% "rotten" rating from 148 reviews, as of Wednesday afternoon.
"Sometimes the weight of all this responsibility causes 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' ... to buckle at the knees," O'Sullivan wrote.

     “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” Is Prefab Marvel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Another earlier Marvel movie, the first “Ant-Man” film, from 2015, was a giddy delight.
The third film in the series, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” which comes out Friday, reaches an appalling form of perfection.
In the first two “Ant-Man” movies, the Quantum Realm, where characters shrink to subatomic size, is depicted as hallucinatory, lurid abstractions.
It isn’t only the ways of life in the Quantum Realm that remain undeveloped; its physical setting is generic.
It’s sadly appropriate for the degree zero of superhero-franchise synthetics to have been reached, or asymptotically approximated, in the infinitesimal realm in which “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is set.

     Summary: In 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,' the setting is subatomic — as are the stakesEnlarge this image toggle caption Marvel Studios Marvel StudiosYou know what?
Maybe this is what we're all just doing now, making movies like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
Even more mind-boggling: This third Ant-Man film posits the purple, time-traveling despot Kang the Conqueror as a bad guy to take seriously.
When we eventually get a The Making Of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, we might well learn that those three actors actually filmed that scene together.
The characters of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, at least, are flat.
