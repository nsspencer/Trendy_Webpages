     Paul George gets real about Bones Hyland trade to Clippers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Clippers eight-time All-Star Paul George is no stranger to trades.
So, as George speaks on the trade deadline move that sent second-year guard Bones Hyland to L.A., he’s speaking from a place of genuine understanding.
However, on a veteran-laden team with championship-level expectations, George is aware that the mentoring of Hyland will happen by committee.
He’s going to have a lot of help.
Nonetheless, should he gel with the Clippers, L.A. could have their next Sixth Man of the Year.

     Shams: Russell Westbrook Buyout Market 'Slow-Moving'; No Traction with Clippers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rocky Widner/NBAE via Getty ImagesThe potential buyout market for Utah Jazz star Russell Westbrook remains cool, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium.
Regarding the Los Angeles Clippers specifically, he said he "[had] not heard any traction yet."
Were he to hit the open market, Wojnarowski listed the Clippers, Chicago Bulls and Miami Heat as possible suitors.
In Los Angeles, meanwhile, both Paul George and Marcus Morris Sr. have lobbied for Westbrook to stay on the West Coast and join them on the Clippers.
In the aftermath of his trade to the Jazz, it quickly became clear how much the relationship between Westbrook and the Los Angeles Lakers deteriorated.

     Paul George says winning a title with Clippers would '100 percent outweigh' winning one with Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers paired Anthony Davis with LeBron James, who had signed one year earlier; the Clippers in one swoop signed Kawhi Leonard and traded for Paul George.
As for the Clippers, they made the first conference finals appearance in franchise history in 2021, but have only won three total playoff series with Leonard and George.
"A championship with the Clippers 100% will outweigh a championship being with the Lakers," he says.
The Clippers were one of the preseason picks to win it all this season, but injuries have once again held them back.
Barring an unexpected surge after the break, George's dream of defining his legacy with a Clippers title will have to wait another season.
