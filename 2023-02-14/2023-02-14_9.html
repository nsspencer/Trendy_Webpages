     Cardi B and Offset's romantic Valentine's Day meal at McDonalds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nothing says true love more than sharing a quarter pounder with cheese at Mcdonalds with your other half on the most romantic day of the year.
The two celebs made an appearance at the Times Square Mcdonald's branch on Valentine's Day as part of the fast-food chain's latest advert campaign.
"While it might not be an official love language, our fans know a true sign of love is knowing your person's go-to McDonald's order," explained the fast-food chain ahead of Valentine's Day.

     I tried Cardi B and Offset's McDonald's date-night meal and think the chain should break up with celebrity collaborations

     Summary: Cardi B also says that she loves the barbecue sauce from McDonald's, so I added that to the burger to try and amp up the flavor and bring something new to it.
McDonald's cheeseburger with barbecue sauce.
Erin McDowell/Insider"Whether it's going for a date night or grabbing a bite after late-night studio sessions … I'm always asking Offset to take me to McDonald's," Cardi B said in a press release announcing the meal.
"And now, Offset and I have a meal named after us!
However, given that the burger already comes with a generous amount of ketchup and mustard, the result of my decision to add the barbecue sauce was a slightly soggy bun.
