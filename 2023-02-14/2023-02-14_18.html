     Celtics injury report: Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum set to return vs. Pistons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum and Al Horford have all been removed from Boston's injury report and will be available to play in Wednesday's game against the Detroit Pistons at TD Garden.
Wednesday is Boston's last game until Feb. 23, so it's possible the Celtics just want to give Smart some game action before taking a week off.
The Celtics also will be glad to have Tatum back after he missed Tuesday's overtime loss to the Bucks with a non-COVID illness.
Boston is 2-2 in the four games Tatum has missed this season.
ET on Tuesday, with NBC Sports Boston's coverage beginning at 6:30 p.m. with "Celtics Pregame Live."

     Celtics injury report: Jayson Tatum upgraded, six players listed for Wednesday’s game vs. Pistons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Celtics will get a major boost on Wednesday night as three starters were removed from the team’s injury report against the Pistons including All-Star Jayson Tatum.
Rob Williams is questionable due to ankle soreness while Derrick White is probable with ear pain.
The lengthy injury report did not include Jayson Tatum (illness) and Al Horford (knee) who both missed Tuesday’s loss in Milwaukee.
Boston only had 11 active players including both two-way players for Tuesday’s matchup but nearly pulled off an upset win over the Bucks despite playing shorthanded.
“Our guys are NBA players, they do a great job regardless of who’s out there.
