     Disney Distribution President Dave Hollis Has Died at 47
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to a family representative Dave Hollis, an executive of the Walt Disney Company who formerly served as its President of Worldwide Distribution, has died at the age of 47 following a recent hospitalization for a heart condition.
As stated in The Hollywood Reporter, Hollis served as a lead figure for Disney‚Äôs theatrical distribution division during a seven-year period of great financial success and critical acclaim.
In fact, Hollis‚Äô wife was a huge motivating factor in his leaving The Walt Disney Studios, after which he relocated to Texas with his four children and Rachel, helping to manage his wife‚Äôs company up until they divorced.
Furthermore, despite his recent health struggles, a representative for the Hollis family told The Hollywood Reporter that he died peacefully at home just outside of Austin, Texas.
From everyone at Disney Dining, we offer our sincerest condolences and commemorate his legacy and contributions to Disney‚Äôs success.
