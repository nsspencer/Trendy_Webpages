     Watch Nikki Haley kick off 2024 presidential campaign in South Carolina
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nikki Haley kicked off her campaign for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination in Charleston on Wednesday morning.
"For a strong America, for a proud America, I am running for President of the United States of America."
Haley had already announced her White House bid a day earlier, making her the first major challenger to former President Donald Trump, who launched his campaign in November.
Haley, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, is now his direct rival — and his only real one, until more candidates jump into the Republican primary field.
After Haley's first campaign event in Charleston, she's headed to hit the campaign trail with stops in the key primary states of New Hampshire and Iowa.

“Every day we’re told America is flawed, rotten and full of hate,” Haley said on Wednesday.
“Joe and Kamala even say America is racist.
“It is unthinkable that Americans would look at the sky and see a Chinese spy balloon looking back at us,” Haley added.

"The KKK came to South Carolina from out of state to protest on our statehouse grounds," she told a crowd at a Rubio event.
"Here is this guy who comes out with his manifesto, holding the Confederate flag and had just hijacked everything that people thought of," she told Beck.
"Where does he get this association, the Confederate flag, with white supremacy and racist ideology?
While the Charleston shooting was a part of her announcement video, the push to take down the Confederate flag was notably absent.

     Summary: The episode was one of many where Haley made headlines during her time at the UN by rebuking Palestinians and voicing support for Israel.
But her candidacy has renewed criticism from Palestinian rights advocates who say Haley’s diplomatic career was defined by pro-Israel advocacy — and her “bigotry” against Palestinians was often overlooked.
Early in her tenure as envoy, Haley made it clear that she would make backing Israel at the UN a priority.

But even in a party of cowards and hucksters, few people can rival Haley when it comes to platinum-tier opportunism.
That is not who we are.”But it’s who Nikki Haley was, at least for a while.
(Right now, Haley is polling somewhere between Mike Pence and a dust bunny; she’s tied at 3 percent with a hypothetical Rubio candidacy.)
For all her talk about “a new generation,” Haley knows that the Republican base doesn’t want to move on.

     Summary: Climate change isn’t expected to be a central issue in the GOP presidential primary.
Conservative environmental groups have applauded Haley’s willingness to discuss climate change, saying it could win over younger conservative voters, who polls show are more concerned about the issue than older generations.
Or what the solutions to climate change are?
Haley’s rhetoric could resonate with younger conservative voters who “care a lot” about addressing climate change, he added, pointing to recent polling.
But I am grateful to her for saying clearly that climate change is real.”Liberal jeersHowever, liberal green groups say it’s not enough for Haley to simply acknowledge the reality of the climate crisis.
