     Celtics injury report: Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum set to return vs. Pistons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum and Al Horford have all been removed from Boston's injury report and will be available to play in Wednesday's game against the Detroit Pistons at TD Garden.
Wednesday is Boston's last game until Feb. 23, so it's possible the Celtics just want to give Smart some game action before taking a week off.
The Celtics also will be glad to have Tatum back after he missed Tuesday's overtime loss to the Bucks with a non-COVID illness.
Boston is 2-2 in the four games Tatum has missed this season.
ET on Tuesday, with NBC Sports Boston's coverage beginning at 6:30 p.m. with "Celtics Pregame Live."

     Celtics: Derrick White dealing with bonkers injury, but there's a catch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marcus Smart is finally expected to make his long-awaited return from injury on Wednesday when the Boston Celtics take on the Detroit Pistons.
Despite this significant development, however, the C’s are still dealing with a myriad of injuries at the moment.
This includes a rather bizarre injury for Derrick White, who is currently dealing with a concerning ear injury.
Thankfully, the injury does not seem as bad as it sounds, and White has actually been cleared to play against the Pistons.
The 6-foot-4 combo guard has been integral to the Celtics’ success this season, especially considering the injuries they have been dealing with in their backcourt.

     Celtics’ Marcus Smart to return Wednesday vs. Pistons after 11-game injury absence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celtics guard Marcus Smart will return versus the Pistons on Wednesday night, the team announced.
Here’s what you need to know:Smart hasn’t played since exiting a Jan. 21 contest against the Raptors with a right ankle sprain.
Smart leads Boston with 7.2 assists and 1.3 steals per game.
In the past week, the team also saw All-Star Jaylen Brown go down with a facial fracture that could keep him out through the All-Star break.
What to make of the timingSmart sprained his right ankle, but it was the re-aggravation of a bone bruise in that ankle suffered last postseason that kept him shelved for three weeks.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celtics Celtics show grit, depth in short-handed loss to Bucks: 5 takeaways The Bucks closed the gap in the standings, but they didn't inspire confidence.
The Celtics were without Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and Al Horford on Tuesday.
Tuesday’s game looked like it would be an unserious contest.
In the process, they nearly toppled a Bucks team that won 10 games in a row entering Tuesday’s game and exited with a very shaky overtime victory.
The Celtics aren’t going to blow out the Bucks with Tatum, Brown, Horford and Smart back in the lineup just because they came close to beating the Bucks in their absence.
