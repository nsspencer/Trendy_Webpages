     Raiders Release Derek Carr After Being Unable To Trade The Veteran Quarterback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been no secret that the Las Vegas Raiders were moving on at the quarterback position this off-season.
They made that official on Tuesday when they released veteran starter, Derek Carr.
With no other deals left on the table, the Raiders had no choice but to cut ties with Carr.
The question now is: Where will Derek Carr play next year?
We’ll find out who gets the next shot at ‘The Derek Carr Project’.

     There's a lot standing in between Derek Carr and the Commanders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Derek Carr's career with the Raiders came to a close on Tuesday, when Las Vegas opted to release the former second-round choice.
Carr's 2022 campaign was a disappointing one (especially considering that it was his first alongside ex-college teammate Davante Adams), but he's still an accomplished pro passer, which is something Ron Rivera's club could badly use.
Now, if it were 2022 instead of 2023, perhaps the Commanders would be more enticed by Carr.
Carr, not Howell, figures to be a better option for helping the coach do just that from a pure experience perspective.
That's a lot to cross off for Derek Carr.

     Panthers emerge as favorites to land QB Derek Carr
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The quarterback carousel started up Tuesday, with Derek Carr officially on the market after his release from the Las Vegas Raiders.
Though he was linked to another NFC South team in recent weeks, it's the Carolina Panthers who have moved to No.
The Panthers are +140 favorites to be Carr's landing spot, with the New Orleans Saints right behind at +150.
Carr figures to be a better option than bringing either of those quarterbacks back, and New Orleans reportedly met with Carr over two days last week.
Some longshots for Carr's services include Rodgers' Green Bay Packers (+1800), the Indianapolis Colts (+2200) and the Houston Texans (+5000).

     Raiders make Derek Carr release official ahead of deadline: Where will he sign?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Las Vegas Raiders informed Derek Carr on Tuesday that they have released him.
An injury to Carr would have guaranteed his contract next season, a risk the Raiders weren't willing to take as they intended to release him.
(Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images)The move signals the end of a Raiders era that saw Carr start all but four regular-season games for the franchise since it drafted him in 2014.
Carr met with New Orleans last week after the Raiders granted the Saints permission with the possibility of a trade still on the table.
But Carr reportedly enacted his no-trade clause, hastening Tuesday's decision by the Raiders to release him.
