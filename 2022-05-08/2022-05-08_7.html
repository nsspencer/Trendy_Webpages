Wednesday [against Wolves] is a real, real, real final for us.
After Wednesday's trip to Wolves, City visit West Ham on Sunday before ending the season at home to Aston Villa a week later.

     Summary: If City can get over the line in the Premier League, though, they will confirm themselves as the dominant force in English football.
Manchester City are on the cusp of back-to-back Premier League titles for the second time in five years.
James Gill - Danehouse/Getty ImagesFlights back from Madrid on Thursday morning were full of supporters concerned that the chastening experience in the Champions League might prompt an implosion in the title race, but by the time Sterling scored after 19 minutes, chants of "champions, champions" were reverberating around the Etihad.
"Hopefully we can arrive at the Aston Villa game on the final day of the season with the destiny of the Premier League in our hands.
An inexplicable collapse in a Champions League semifinal is a hard thing to get over, but another Premier League triumph -- potentially back-to-back titles for a second time in five years -- is more than just a consolation.

CNN —Manchester City licked the wounds of its heartbreaking Champions League exit by taking a step towards the Premier League title with a dominant 5-0 victory over Newcastle United on Sunday.
Despite the continued elusiveness of the Champions League, another league victory would mark a fourth in five years for the Citizens, and simultaneously end Liverpool’s pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple.
The Spaniard escaped his marker to head home De Bruyne’s corner for his third league goal in as many games.
