     Manchester City thrash Newcastle to seize on Liverpool's slip-up in title race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Manchester City licked the wounds of its heartbreaking Champions League exit by taking a step towards the Premier League title with a dominant 5-0 victory over Newcastle United on Sunday.
Liverpool's frustrating draw with Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday offered City the opportunity to go three points clear at the summit with just three games to play, and Pep Guardiola's side made no mistake with a scintillating performance at the Etihad Stadium.
Raheem Sterling's opener settled any lingering nerves following Wednesday's semifinal collapse against Real Madrid, which had seen City -- seemingly cruising through to a second straight final -- concede twice at the death before Karim Benzema completed the fightback in extra-time.
Goals from Spanish duo Aymeric Laporte and Rodri against Newcastle were followed by late strikes from Phil Foden and Sterling, adding further gloss on a near-perfect weekend for City, who will retain its Premier League crown with victories over Wolves, West Ham and Aston Villa regardless of Liverpool's efforts.
Despite the continued elusiveness of the Champions League, another league victory would mark a fourth in five years for the Citizens, and simultaneously end Liverpool's pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mind games used to be part and parcel of a Premier League title race.
So it was somewhat refreshing to see Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola attempt to bring title race mind games back into fashion on Sunday.
"Not in the Premier League - they've won one in 30 years.
Wednesday [against Wolves] is a real, real, real final for us.
After Wednesday's trip to Wolves, City visit West Ham on Sunday before ending the season at home to Aston Villa a week later.

     Summary: Any hangover following their dramatic semi-final loss against Real Madrid was swept away as Raheem Sterling struck twice for Manchester City in the sunshine at The Etihad Stadium.
Both sides have three games left to play and City now also have a four-goal superior goal difference.
The title race continues in midweek with Liverpool up against Aston Villa on Tuesday and City facing Wolverhampton Wanderers the day after.
Arsenal are four points above fifth-placed Tottenham who they play on Thursday, and are only a point behind third-placed Chelsea.
West Ham United bounced back from their Europa League semi-final defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt to thrash already-relegated Norwich City 4-0 at Carrow Road.

     Summary: If City can get over the line in the Premier League, though, they will confirm themselves as the dominant force in English football.
Manchester City are on the cusp of back-to-back Premier League titles for the second time in five years.
James Gill - Danehouse/Getty ImagesFlights back from Madrid on Thursday morning were full of supporters concerned that the chastening experience in the Champions League might prompt an implosion in the title race, but by the time Sterling scored after 19 minutes, chants of "champions, champions" were reverberating around the Etihad.
"Hopefully we can arrive at the Aston Villa game on the final day of the season with the destiny of the Premier League in our hands.
An inexplicable collapse in a Champions League semifinal is a hard thing to get over, but another Premier League triumph -- potentially back-to-back titles for a second time in five years -- is more than just a consolation.
