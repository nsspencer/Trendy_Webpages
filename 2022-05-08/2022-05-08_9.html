     NXIVM guru wants new judge to decide evidence planting claim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Attorneys for Keith Raniere want a new federal judge to consider a motion for new trial that argues federal authorities framed the former leader of the cult-like NXIVM group by planting child pornography on a computer hard driveNEW YORK -- Attorneys for Keith Raniere, the former leader of the cult-like NXIVM group, want a new federal judge to consider a motion for new trial filed last week that argues federal authorities framed Raniere by planting child pornography on a computer hard drive.
Raniere's lawyers take aim at U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in new court papers, alleging he showed a “lack of judicial temperament” and “deep-seated, unequivocal hostility” for Raniere throughout the proceedings that landed the disgraced self-improvement guru in federal prison for 120 years for a sex-trafficking conspiracy.
“Only a new judge can fairly adjudicate any further issues in this case without these pre-existing biases and prejudices,” attorney Joseph Tully wrote in a motion Friday in Brooklyn federal court.
“Anyone who had entered the courtroom and witnessed Judge Garaufis’ outrageous comments during trial, at the restitution hearing, or at sentencing, would have concluded that the judge was biased against Mr. Raniere and his counsel.”Federal prosecutors have not yet responded to the motion to disqualify Garaufis.
They have denied Raniere's claims of government tampering with evidence.

They can be investigations or experiences; The Times used security and cellphone video, along with interviews, to tell the story of one Ukraine apartment house as Russians invaded.
The Times used satellite images to quickly disprove Russian claims that atrocities committed in Ukraine had been staged.
Browne said the goal of his unit's reporting is to create stories with impact that touch upon broader truths.

     Syrians in desperate need of aid hit hard by Ukraine fallout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aid agencies are hoping to draw some of the world’s attention back to Syria in a two-day donor conference for humanitarian aid to Syrians that begins Monday in Brussels, hosted by the U.N. and the European Union.
Umm Khaled is among those who rely on food aid.
The vast majority of wheat brought into northwest Syria is of Ukrainian origin, and the territory doesn’t produce enough wheat for its own needs.
Starting this month in northwest Syria, the provisions will go down to 1,177 calories a day, from 1,340.
In northwest Syria, “a staggering 4.1 million people” need humanitarian aid, Msuya said — not just food, but also medicines, blankets, school supplies and shelter.
