     Summary: 1 of 6Credit: WWE.comOne of the few matches that didn't happen a few weeks ago, it's only natural for Happy Corbin and Madcap Moss to feud now that they've ended their partnership.
Moss is still trying to find himself as a babyface but has fully turned, apologizing to the fans for his past transgressions and seeking to make Corbin the butt of his future jokes.
Moss needs the win more, and Corbin, as the more seasoned performer and the heel, is better suited at continuing the feud after a loss.
It's far better for Moss to prove he doesn't need Corbin than to fall short, lose his momentum and come off as though he's made a mistake ditching his boss.
Prediction: Moss wins

     Predicting WWE WrestleMania Backlash 2022 Results That Will Anger Fans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With a storyline that hardly ever evolves and segments that are redundant and often pointless, the WWE Universe is over Reigns as champion.
The problem for WrestleMania Backlash and wrestling fans is that WWE is only worried about protecting their champion at all costs, even if it means hurting the other performers involved.
While polarizing among wrestling fans, Flair is one of the greatest women's wrestlers in history already and has brought relevance to the blue brand's title.
Rousey also receives a mixed reaction from the WWE Universe, making it hard for people to get excited about the storyline, characters or matchup.
With Moss needing a victory more for credibility, he will be the winner, drawing the ire of wrestling fans.

(Credit: George ... [+] Napolitano/MediaPunch /IPX) George Napolitano/MediaPunch/IPxWWE is in the midst of a post-WrestleMania 38 lull, and WrestleMania Backlash isn’t going to change that.
Let’s examine five smart booking moves WWE must make at WrestleMania Backlash 2022.
Bobby Lashley Is Protected In DefeatWhen it comes to Bobby Lashley vs. Omos, WWE finds itself between a rock and a hard place.
Still, WWE needs to protect him at WrestleMania Backlash, or else it risks him eventually turning into the dancing version of The Great Khali.

     Summary: WWE's WrestleMania Backlash takes place tonight at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island, marking WWE's first major event since last month's WrestleMania 38.
Can this show keep WWE's post-WrestleMania momentum rolling even without a world title match?
Does a Lack of a World Championship Match Hurt Your Excitement for This Show?
What really bums me out is that we don't get to have that promised unifying Tag Team Championship match though.
Evan: Unlike my stance on the WWE Championship sitting this one out, this is at least a slight blow to the show overall.
