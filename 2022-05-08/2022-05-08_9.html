     Summary: Kendrick Lamar has shared a new song and music video.
ADVERTISEMENTThe song begins with Kendrick thanking his fans, family, and teachers, before launching into a blistering critique of modern notions of culture.
Throughout the video, directed by Lamar and Dave Free, Kendrick's face gets deep faked into different – and often controversial – Black men like O.J.
Earlier this week, Lamar posted a picture on his website oklama.com that strongly suggested Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers will be a double album.
Damn, Lamar's 2017 album, won numerous awards including a Pulitzer Prize for Music.

     Kendrick Lamar releases new song “The Heart Part 5,” new album out this week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kendrick Lamar's long-awaited album Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers comes out this Friday (5/13), and he's just released his first new song since 2018, "The Heart Part 5."
The song comes with a video directed by Kendrick and Dave Free, in which Kendrick raps the song in front of a red backdrop, and as the song goes on, his face morphs into O.J.
Kendrick has said Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers will be his last album for TDE.
Kendrick also recently posted a new teaser for the album featuring a photo of two CDs, one titled "Morale" and one titled "Steppers."
No word yet if this song will be on the album, but the previous four "The Heart" songs have been non-album tracks.

     Watch Kendrick Lamar Transform Into Kanye West, Jussie Smollet, Will Smith, and Nipsey Hussle in New Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The video begins simply enough, with Lamar rapping looking slightly off camera against a maroon backdrop.
This continues for the rest of the video, with him taking on the visages of Kanye West, Jussie Smollett, Will Smith—all notably in the news for recent problematic behavior.
In the final verse, Lamar takes on two fallen Los Angeles giants: Kobe Bryant and Nipsey Hussle.
(Which tracks, since most of “The Heart” songs precede a new project.)
A picture Lamar posted last week implies the new project is actually a double album; there's surely a lot more to come in the days leading up to its release.

     Kendrick Lamar Shares New Song “The Heart Part 5,” Deepfakes Kanye, OJ, Will Smith in Video: Watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s a new Kendrick Lamar song in the world.
In the video, directed by Dave Free and Lamar, the rapper’s face morphs into several deepfakes, including OJ Simpson, Will Smith, Jussie Smollett, Kobe Bryant, Kanye West, and Nipsey Hussle.
The lyrics often align with the person he’s resembling, discussing bipolar disorder when he’s West and murder when he’s the late Hussle.
Earlier this year, it was reported that Lamar was producing a new live action comedy alongside the duo.
In August of last year, Lamar launched his Oklama site with a note discussing his longtime label.
