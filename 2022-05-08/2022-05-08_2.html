     Buster Posey downplays possibility of coaching in MLB
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sure, he misses aspects of baseball like spending time with teammates, but now he’s spending that time with his family.
He still loves the game, and has been coaching his son, Lee, and daughter, Allison, in youth baseball and softball.
“I wouldn’t say never say never, but it would have to be a ways down the road,” Posey, 35, said Saturday.
I guess that’s a long way of saying no.”The time commitment that comes with coaching would be too much for Posey, at least any time soon.
“Hopefully one that the kids are excited to show up to practice for,” Posey said of what kind of youth coach he’s becoming.

     Buster Posey hilariously trolls the Cardinals at his Giants ceremony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ahead of their home clash against the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday, the San Francisco Giants took some time to commemorate the career of former catcher Buster Posey.
The team held a “Buster Posey Day,” where former Giants players and coaches paid tribute to the career of the three-time World Series champion.
He went through many of his highs during his run with the Giants, including the team’s 2012 World Series run that included an NLCS win over the Cardinals.
Posey did not necessarily shine for the Giants in the NLCS victory over the Cardinals, as he hit .154 and recorded a mere one RBI over the seven games.
From the three World Series titles to the seven All-Star nods, Posey finished his career in San Francisco as one of the more prolific hitters in franchise history.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO -- As he took the podium Saturday afternoon, Buster Posey told a story of growing up in Georgia in 1995.

Posey became enamored with the thought of 25 men pushing for the same goal: Winning a World Series title.
He won three of them in San Francisco, and on Saturday afternoon, former teammates and coaches descended on Oracle Park for Buster Posey Day.
Buster called a backdoor slider that sent us to our first World Series and then later on he caught another slider in Texas, to win our first World Series.

     Summary: Buster Posey Day at Oracle Park featured a rousing pregame ceremony held for fans and some of Posey’s closest baseball allies to pay tribute to a seven-time All-Star catcher.
It also offered Posey a chance to say farewell and thanks, officially.
“It was very important for me to say thank you to the fan base,” Posey said moments after the ceremony.
… He got me a ring,” said Molina, drawing laughs — he had been guaranteed a ring in 2010 because both of his teams, the Giants and Rangers, met in the World Series.
He was the league’s top rookie, an MVP, a Gold Glover, a batting champ and, most of all, a three-time World Series champ.

     Summary: Bart knows he’s not Posey.
“Don’t think that’s unusual for a young player.”But the struggles at the plate haven’t bled over into his work behind the dish.
“I don’t want to stick to one format because it seemed like a good idea before the game,” Cobb said Friday.
On top of all the opposing lineup studying, PitchCom learning, spending time on his own performance at the plate, Bart has had to download the tendencies of all sorts of pitchers.
Perhaps the Buster Posey Day festivities are as much a celebration of him as it is an acknowledgement of that fact.

     Summary: Giants announcer Mike Krukow had gotten most of the way through reciting Buster Posey’s extensive career dossier to a sellout crowd when he slipped in a playful jab.
“I could run when I needed to, OK?”Buster Posey always knew when he needed to.
He knew when he needed to harness useful adrenaline and when to discard the anxiety that didn’t serve a purpose.
And he knew he needed to do one final thing on an afternoon that the Giants marketed as Buster Posey Day but, to his mind, was less for him and more for everyone else.
Buster Posey didn’t have to do that.
