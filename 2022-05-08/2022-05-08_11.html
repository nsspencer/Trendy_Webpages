     Lewis Hamilton: Extra pit stop at Miami GP felt like a gamble I didn't want to take
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hasan Bratic/picture alliance via Getty ImagesMIAMI - Lewis Hamilton said the late pit stop Mercedes offered him and he declined to take felt like an unnecessary risk as he once again bemoaned the timing of a safety car at the Miami Grand Prix.
With the safety car still out Hamilton was asked by Mercedes if he wanted to make another stop, to which he replied: "You tell me, man!
Either way, we've just been unfortunate with the timing of the safety car today."
Hamilton was complimentary of Russell's move and said the race was proof he should have started on the hard tyre, not the medium.
He was on the better tyre to start with, the hard tyre was the better tyre, so in hindsight maybe we could have started on the hard tyre.

Then rule enforcement disallows jewelry and body piercings from being worn during F1 races, a decision that is said to be meant for safety reasons.

I’ve been in the sport for 16 years and I’ve been wearing jewelry for 16 years.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I’ve got certain piercings that I really just can’t take out, that not many people know of,” he explained during a pre-race press session, to the general amusement of the room.
Surely Hamilton, however cool and daring he might be, is not driving around at 200 miles-per-hour with a metal object inserted down there.
Speaking Friday while pointedly wearing what seemed like several dozen items of jewelry, Hamilton took a much more serious tone about the jewelry ban.
Fortunately, we can turn once more to Hamilton’s Instagram account, where our hero is not above occasionally showing feet:View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lewis Hamilton (@lewishamilton) Would Lewis Hamilton bop up and down like this if he had an unremovable platinum piercing somewhere on his feet?
Hamilton is not the only driver who suspects that safety concerns cannot entirely account for the FIA’s sudden crackdown.
