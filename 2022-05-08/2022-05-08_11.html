     The clubs Max Homa used to win the 2022 Wells Fargo Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Starting the day two shots behind Bradley, Homa made that up and then some by knocking an approach to eight feet at the opening hole to make birdie, and then he grabbed another at the fifth with a sand wedge to eight feet.
Bradley, meanwhile, played the same stretch two over, including a double bogey at the par-5 second hole.
Homa then hit a 7-iron to 10 feet at the par-3 ninth for another birdie and followed it with another at the par-5 10th, courtesy of a nice pitch with his Titleist Vokey SM9 lob wedge—a club he changed the bounce and grind on three years earlier at the Wells Fargo.

     Max Homa Wins Wells Fargo Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I just feel like life's good," Homa said afterward.
This is the second time Homa has won the Wells Fargo Championship, having also won the event in 2019 for his first PGA Tour victory.
Homa now has two wins in the 2021-20 season after winning the Fortinet Championship in Napa, Calif., back in September.
But after just four holes Homa had a two-stroke lead, thanks largely to Bradley's double bogey on No.
But Bradley could not make up that one stroke on the final two holes when Homa played solid golf..

     Summary: ‘Come on!’: Max Homa holds off Keegan Bradley for victory on Mother’s DayShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailGetty Images“This has been a fun day of golf.”Those were Jim Nantz’s choice words as Keegan Bradley reached the 18th tee Sunday evening at TPC Potomac.
Bradley and Max Homa and every other golfer atop the leaderboard grinded through the Wells Fargo Championship this weekend.
And for the golf-loving fans at home, that is some fun golf to watch.
“Keegan is a really good golfer.
He holed some really good putts.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadThere was a time when Max Homa didn’t believe Max Homa could do what Max Homa did Sunday at TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm, which is confidently and calmly play 18 holes of golf with a tournament there for the taking, even as his playing partner wouldn’t quite let him grab complete control.
His résumé has long said the former NCAA champion at California also lost his right to play on the PGA Tour.
Advertisement“I definitely knew I was capable of being a regular PGA Tour player.
But it also represents the building belief that Max Homa more than belongs on the PGA Tour.

As well, he became the fifth multiple winner on the PGA Tour this season.
I knew he was never going to go away and I just tried to keep hitting good shots.
The 2011 PGA Championship winner had an up-and-down day with two double bogeys, three bogeys and five birdies.
Overall it’s been a good weekend, a decent week, something to build on going into the PGA (Championship in two weeks).

Grade: A+Here are the rest of our grades for the 2022 Wells Fargo Championship:T2.
Rory McIlroy: A month removed from competition, McIlroy began his Wells Fargo Championship in a flurry and looked as if he would be a major factor over the weekend.
His game has looked sharp all year, and he finds his name below only Scottie Scheffler and Jon Rahm on the PGA Championship odds board.
Tenth in strokes-gained putting on the week, the return to bent grass treated Fowler well as he gears up for the PGA Championship.
