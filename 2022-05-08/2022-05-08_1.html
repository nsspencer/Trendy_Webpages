     Summary: The BBC has named Ncuti Gatwa as Doctor Who’s Fourteenth Doctor.
Gatwa will take over the role in 2023, replacing Jodie Whittaker as the current Doctor.
Ncuti Gatwa is the Doctor.
Gatwa will be the first Black man to play the Doctor, a role that has been passed around to different actors since Doctor Who’s debut in 1963.
In line with the series’ tradition, Whittaker will appear in one last episode that will introduce Gatwa as the Fourteenth Doctor.

     Ncuti Gatwa Cast As the New Doctor in Doctor Who
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gatwa will be the first Black lead in the show’s 59-year history.
When William Hartnell, who played the first Doctor, suffered from deteriorating health in 1966, he decided to leave the popular series in its fourth season.
Producers decided that since The Doctor was not of this Earth, he could “regenerate” into another form.
The next chapter in Doctor Who will also serve as a return for Russell T Davies as showrunner.
Whatever changes occur behind the scenes, we trust they are wise enough not to exterminate the greatest theme song in the history of television.

     New ‘Doctor Who’ star is ‘Sex Education’ actor Ncuti Gatwa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (AP) — Ncuti Gatwa will take the mantle from Jodie Whittaker on “Doctor Who,” the BBC announced Sunday, ending speculation over the iconic Time Lord’s next regeneration.
The Rwanda-born, Scotland-raised Gatwa, 29, will be the first Black actor to helm the quintessential British sci-fi show, but he won’t be the first Black Doctor — Jo Martin has played “Fugitive Doctor” in several episodes.
In addition to seeing the start of Gatwa’s tenure, next year also marks Davies’ return to “Doctor Who” after more than a decade’s absence.
“Russell T Davies is almost as iconic as the Doctor himself and being able to work with him is a dream come true,” Gatwa said.
“Unlike the Doctor, I may only have one heart but I am giving it all to this show,” Gatwa added.

     Summary: The BBC has asked Ncuti Gatwa to make the world a little more sonic with them, tapping Gatwa to be the first Black lead in the "Doctor Who" franchise.
Gatwa, 29, will take over the role from Jodie Whitaker to become the 14th Doctor, the BBC announced on Sunday.
In a statement published on the show's website, Gatwa said he was "deeply honoured, beyond excited and of course a little bit scared."
Whitaker took over the role in 2017 from Peter Capaldi, becoming the first woman to play the iconic role in "Doctor Who" history.
Gatwa is now the first non-white person to play The Doctor.

Gatwa, who has been nominated for Best Male Performance in a comedy program at this year's BAFTAs, will now become the 14th Doctor in the show.
