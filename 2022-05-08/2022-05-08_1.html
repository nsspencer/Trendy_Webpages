     Max Verstappen Wins Miami Grand Prix for Back-to-Back Victories
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Verstappen won the Miami Grand Prix, beating out a late push by Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc to secure the victory.
It was Verstappen’s second straight win, coming weeks after finishing first in Italy at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.
Leclerc finished in second place, while Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz came in third to take the last spot on the podium.
The win moves Verstappen to within 19 points of Leclerc for the drivers’ championship, with Leclerc now holding a 104–85 lead.
After the race, Leclerc noted his car’s difficulty with medium tires and thought that he would be able to overtake Verstappen in the final laps, but ultimately fell short.

     2022 Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix winner: Max Verstappen puts his troubles, and Ferrari, behind him in Florida
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Max Verstappen put his head down at the start, slipped past Carlos Sainz Jr. by the first turn and then caught Charles Leclerc down the back straight for the race lead.
And so Leclerc continues the trend of drivers leading the First Practice failing to win the race.
In fact, it only happened five times last season where a driver who led P1 went on to win.
It's simply that Pirelli did a good job on their homework and brought a good mix of tires to the race.
And that brings us to Mercedes, who teased us Friday, fell off on Saturday, then flashed potential again on Sunday.

     2022 Miami Grand Prix report and highlights: Verstappen wins inaugural Miami Grand Prix over Leclerc after late Safety Car drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Perez took the opportunity to pit for new mediums from P4, emerging there, with hard-shod Verstappen, Leclerc and Sainz ahead.
The Lap 47 restart saw Verstappen lead away but struggle to build up a gap to Leclerc.
But neither Perez nor Leclerc could make headway, and the win – narrow as it was over the Ferraris – would be Verstappen's.
Despite starting on the front row, Ferrari couldn't convert their advantage to a Miami Grand Prix win – while Max Verstappen has now made it two wins in a row.
The Lap 47 restart would therefore see Verstappen lead Leclerc and Sainz (the top three on hards).
