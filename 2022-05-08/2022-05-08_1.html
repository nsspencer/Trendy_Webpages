     New ‘Doctor Who’ star is ‘Sex Education’ actor Ncuti Gatwa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (AP) — Ncuti Gatwa will take the mantle from Jodie Whittaker on “Doctor Who,” the BBC announced Sunday, ending speculation over the iconic Time Lord’s next regeneration.
The Rwanda-born, Scotland-raised Gatwa, 29, will be the first Black actor to helm the quintessential British sci-fi show, but he won’t be the first Black Doctor — Jo Martin has played “Fugitive Doctor” in several episodes.
In addition to seeing the start of Gatwa’s tenure, next year also marks Davies’ return to “Doctor Who” after more than a decade’s absence.
“Russell T Davies is almost as iconic as the Doctor himself and being able to work with him is a dream come true,” Gatwa said.
“Unlike the Doctor, I may only have one heart but I am giving it all to this show,” Gatwa added.

     'Doctor Who' taps Ncuti Gatwa to take over iconic title character
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The BBC has asked Ncuti Gatwa to make the world a little more sonic with them, tapping Gatwa to be the first Black lead in the "Doctor Who" franchise.
Gatwa, 29, will take over the role from Jodie Whitaker to become the 14th Doctor, the BBC announced on Sunday.
In a statement published on the show's website, Gatwa said he was "deeply honoured, beyond excited and of course a little bit scared."
Whitaker took over the role in 2017 from Peter Capaldi, becoming the first woman to play the iconic role in "Doctor Who" history.
Gatwa is now the first non-white person to play The Doctor.

     Doctor Who: Ncuti Gatwa to replace Jodie Whittaker, BBC announces
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ncuti Gatwa will take over from Jodie Whittaker as the Time Lord in Doctor Who, the BBC has announced.
The 29-year-old will become the 14th Doctor on the popular BBC show after Whittaker announced last July she would be leaving the role.
In a statement on the official Doctor Who website, Ncuti said: “There aren’t quite the words to describe how I’m feeling.
When Gatwa starts his tenure in the Tardis, Doctor Who will not be produced in-house by the BBC, but by Bad Wolf Productions, a company set up by the executives Julie Gardner and Jane Tranter.
Gatwa will be known by fans as the 14th Doctor, despite the numbering of the actors playing Doctor Who getting increasingly jumbled over the years.
