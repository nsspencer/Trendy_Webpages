     Backstage Reaction To Roman Reigns Teasing A Possible Break
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As noted earlier, WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns delivered a promo at a live event in Trenton, NJ last night where he indicated he didn’t know if he’d be back in the city.
“I’ve been here a couple of times in the past 10 years,” the WWE Universal Champion said.
Roman Reigns has had three televised matches this year, 25 on house shows, and nine on dark matches, so though he rarely performs on television, he still wrestles often.
Reigns signed a multi-year contract with WWE back in August of 2019, with no indication of the exact expiration date.
He will appear at tonight’s WWE WrestleMania Backlash pay-per-view when RAW Tag Team Champions RK-Bro &amp; Drew McIntyre go against the SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos &amp; Reigns in non-title six-man action.
