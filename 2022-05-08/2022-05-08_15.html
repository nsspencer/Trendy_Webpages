     Formula 1 news: Lewis Hamilton savage move amid looming jewelry ban
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Formula 1’s governing body is cracking down on jewelry on race day – and Lewis Hamilton is not happy about.
Then rule enforcement disallows jewelry and body piercings from being worn during F1 races, a decision that is said to be meant for safety reasons.
Hamilton, who has several body piercings and isn’t afraid to flex his jewelry pieces, made sure to make a statement during the press conference for the inaugural Formula 1 race in Miami.
I’ve been in the sport for 16 years and I’ve been wearing jewelry for 16 years.
But it’s clear that he’s not in approval of this latest move by the Formula 1’s governing body.

     Lewis Hamilton: Extra pit stop at Miami GP felt like a gamble I didn't want to take
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hasan Bratic/picture alliance via Getty ImagesMIAMI - Lewis Hamilton said the late pit stop Mercedes offered him and he declined to take felt like an unnecessary risk as he once again bemoaned the timing of a safety car at the Miami Grand Prix.
With the safety car still out Hamilton was asked by Mercedes if he wanted to make another stop, to which he replied: "You tell me, man!
Either way, we've just been unfortunate with the timing of the safety car today."
Hamilton was complimentary of Russell's move and said the race was proof he should have started on the hard tyre, not the medium.
He was on the better tyre to start with, the hard tyre was the better tyre, so in hindsight maybe we could have started on the hard tyre.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: | 00:47Lewis Hamilton has launched a scathing attack on Mercedes after yet another strategy blunder allowed teammate George Russell to pass him at the Miami Grand Prix.
Unsurprisingly, Hamilton and Russell had a different view of how the race went when asked afterwards.
But as we venture deeper into the season, Mercedes is edging closer to a breaking point, in which it will abandon its plans and search for a nuclear development solution instead.
Police escort for the Miami F1 podium!
Meanwhile, Russell has 59 points this season, leading Hamilton by 23 after just five races.

I rely on the guys for that, but today they gave the decision to me and I didn't understand it.

     Summary: More infoLewis Hamilton's row with the FIA dominated talk ahead of the Miami GP as the Mercedes star refused to comply with their jewellery ban.
Several F1 drivers have given their take on the situation with the FIA being asked to hold talks with them about the matter.
The Brit has been locked in a bitter standoff with the FIA across this weekend as they clamped down on rules regarding jewellery.
The French driver admitted he could understand Hamilton’s frustration and called on the FIA to hold a meeting with drivers.
The saga is however likely to rear its head again in Monaco where Hamilton has promised he will continue to wear his jewellery.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I’ve got certain piercings that I really just can’t take out, that not many people know of,” he explained during a pre-race press session, to the general amusement of the room.
Surely Hamilton, however cool and daring he might be, is not driving around at 200 miles-per-hour with a metal object inserted down there.
Speaking Friday while pointedly wearing what seemed like several dozen items of jewelry, Hamilton took a much more serious tone about the jewelry ban.
Fortunately, we can turn once more to Hamilton’s Instagram account, where our hero is not above occasionally showing feet:View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lewis Hamilton (@lewishamilton) Would Lewis Hamilton bop up and down like this if he had an unremovable platinum piercing somewhere on his feet?
Hamilton is not the only driver who suspects that safety concerns cannot entirely account for the FIA’s sudden crackdown.
