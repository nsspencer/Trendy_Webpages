     Sterling nets twice in Newcastle rout, Man. City move closer to PL title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sports Desk, May 8 (EFE).- Manchester City on Sunday routed Newcastle 5-0 to move three points clear on top of the Premier League table with three games to go.
It was Raheem Sterling who opened and closed the scoring in Manchester City’s first appearance since their Champions League upset.
Manchester City took the lead 19 minutes into the game, when Sterling headed home off a Joao Cancelo header.
Manchester City bounced back after their 5-6 Champions League semifinal defeat on aggregate against Real Madrid, who were trailing 1-0 in the second leg until the dying minutes.
With the victory, leader Manchester City took advantage of Liverpool’s 1-1 stumble against Tottenham to increase their lead over the Reds to three points with three games to go.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier this week, Mike Keegan and Sami Mokbel of the Daily Mail stunned many by breaking the story around Manchester City being interested in Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba’s signature this summer.
Italian transfer expert Fabrizio Romano had also claimed that Manchester City officials have ‘internally’ discussed the prospect of signing the 29-year old on a free transfer, following the expected expiry of his Manchester United contract.
IMAGO / PA Images “I heard earlier today that (Paul) Pogba is looking at a new house in Manchester.
Now I’m thinking, ‘That’s weird, why would he need to move house to join (Manchester) City?’.
It has also been recently reported by Jason Burt of the Telegraph that ‘initial talks’ have already taken place to make the Manchester United academy graduate a Manchester City player during the upcoming summer transfer window.

     Summary: If City can get over the line in the Premier League, though, they will confirm themselves as the dominant force in English football.
Manchester City are on the cusp of back-to-back Premier League titles for the second time in five years.
James Gill - Danehouse/Getty ImagesFlights back from Madrid on Thursday morning were full of supporters concerned that the chastening experience in the Champions League might prompt an implosion in the title race, but by the time Sterling scored after 19 minutes, chants of "champions, champions" were reverberating around the Etihad.
"Hopefully we can arrive at the Aston Villa game on the final day of the season with the destiny of the Premier League in our hands.
An inexplicable collapse in a Champions League semifinal is a hard thing to get over, but another Premier League triumph -- potentially back-to-back titles for a second time in five years -- is more than just a consolation.

     Summary: Manchester City beat Newcastle to move three points clear at the top of the Premier LeagueManchester (United Kingdom) (AFP) – Manchester City bounced back from their Champions League heartbreak to take a firm grip on the Premier League title race with a 5-0 win over Newcastle on Sunday.
The title is the only trophy left for City to fight for after blowing the chance to reach a second consecutive Champions League final, against Real Madrid on Wednesday.
City showed no signs of physical fatigue or a mental hangover from Madrid as they took full advantage.
Cancelo made amends by creating the opener as he headed across goal for Sterling to nod in his first Premier League goal since February.
City's strength from set-pieces has played a huge role in putting them in pole position to retain the title.
