     Summary: Indeed, somewhere out there, as shown in the film, red means go, and green means stop.
But one thing is for certain where we all live: Benedict Cumberbatch and director Sam Raimi joining together for a comic book movie mean big business for cinemas and for Disney.
The 28th entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (plus a few relevant-to-the-storyline television series, like WandaVision) cast a spell over ticket buyers across the globe this weekend.
Domestically, the story of the former Sorcerer Supreme earned $185 million, according to Variety.
Overseas markets brought in $265 million for a cumulative score of $450 million.

     'SNL': Benedict Cumberbatch and Heidi Gardner Take Focus Group Too Seriously
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saturday Night Live brought us Benedict Cumberbatch hosting for the second time, with musical guest Arcade Fire, and it was a wonderful adventure!
That is to say, he played a character who talked way too much about how ice cream made him feel, and he quite literally looked like Elliot while doing so.
In a sketch called "Blue Bunny", Cumberbatch played a character who is part of a focus group about the ice cream.
The problem here is that Cumberbatch has a big white mustache, white hair, and is a cowboy.
It wasn't the best of the night but if you view it was Cumberbatch getting his own little revenge back at Elliot?

     'SNL': Benedict Cumberbatch's Monologue Celebrates Moms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saturday Night Live brought back Benedict Cumberbatch to host for the second time to help promote the lasted Stephen Strange film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.
The movie which has been abbreviated (aptly) to MoM is hitting theaters on Mother's Day weekend so a lot of Cumberbatch's monologue centered around the women in his life and his messages to them.
In the monologue though, we were gifted with stories of Cumberbatch's mother actress Wanda Ventham and wife, actress Sophie Hunter, in celebration of the holiday.
But Cumberbatch laughed it off, talking directly to his mother and sharing that he called her "pookie" while she called him "Benedict Cumberbatch".
A monologue can make or break an episode and Cumberbatch's was great!

     Summary: Benedict Cumberbatch is showing his support for abortion rights.
To close out his hosting gig, Cumberbatch appeared onstage with musical guest Arcade Fire and various SNL cast members.
Cumberbatch also appeared in the episode's cold open sketch to start the show, which mocked Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's draft decision.
In his opening monologue, Cumberbatch joked about another recent event — Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the 2022 Oscars.
After the in-studio audience laughed at the joke, Cumberbatch poked fun at his choice of words and commented, "No, not physically."

     Summary: The latest episode of “Saturday Night Live” transported viewers back to the Middle Ages amid the leaked draft ruling that hinted the Supreme Court is positioned to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
Hosted by Benedict Cumberbatch with musical guest Arcade Fire, Saturday’s episode also included material related to “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” Mother’s Day and even Will Smith’s infamous Oscars slap.
Cold open tackles Roe vs. Wade leakIn light of the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion overturning Roe vs. Wade, the cold open time-traveled to the medieval era while mocking the criminalization of abortions.

     ‘Saturday Night Live’ Review: The Best and Worst of Benedict Cumberbatch’s Hosting Return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This episode’s cold open also continued down that path, specifically when it came to his — let’s also say distinct — smile.
(While the cast usually gets in on the Mother’s Day spirit, that didn’t happen this time around.)
In a strong episode though, “Chain Gang” was simply the least strong sketch.
And it was the best cold open in quite some time — not just decent for being an “SNL” cold open but legitimately good.
While that sharpness was, of course, in the cold open, it’s not ridiculous to expect that in other pieces of “SNL’s” political comedy.

     Summary: Star Benedict Cumberbatch's look in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness marks a whole new level of commitment to his MCU role.
In his previous appearances as Doctor Strange, Cumberbatch wore a prosthetic goatee, which, according to the actor, limited his facial expressions.
Including the recently released film, Cumberbatch has appeared as Doctor Strange in six films, beginning in 2016.
Prior to Multiverse of Madness, Strange played an integral role in Spider-Man: No Way Home and Avengers: Endgame and Infinity War.
For comparison, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was originally expected to earn approximately $160 million over its opening weekend.

Heidi Gardner and Cumberbatch play two somber westerners who are brought back to a simpler time every time they take a bite.

Cumberbatch also ceased the opportunity to show off his pipes while hosting the show to promote his film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.
