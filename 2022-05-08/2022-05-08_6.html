    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 0 of 4Credit: WWE.comWhile it shared a name with The Most Stupendous Two-Night Event in WrestleMania History, WrestleMania Backlash did not feel as special as last month's show.
With just six matches on this card, it was up to a small section of the WWE roster to deliver.
Cody Rhodes continued his hot streak in WWE by defeating Seth Rollins again, and Omos put on the best performance of his career to date against Bobby Lashley.
Many names got a major boost from this show, but the short card left many forgotten on the night.
WWE Backlash has always been a moment to set a new path post-WrestleMania, and this show gave many a chance to be true winners or losers going into the summer and beyond.

     Summary: 1 of 6WWE kicked off the night's action with one of many WrestleMania rematches when Cody Rhodes faced Seth Rollins.
It seemed as if he was successfully getting inside Rhodes' head at first.
Like their WrestleMania match, they picked up the pace as they went and got the crowd hyped for every big moment.
They paced themselves well so they could sell when they needed to without feeling like the momentum of the match was dying.
Rollins managed to get his foot on the rope to avoid a pin after taking the Cross Rhodes.

     WWE WrestleMania Backlash 2022 Results, Full Recap and Analysis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It appeared that WWE was setting up a future WWE Universal Championship match between Reigns and McIntyre, which you would think would mean McIntyre wins the non-title tag match at WrestleMania Backlash.
After unsuccessfully gunning for the title at WrestleMania, she managed to make Charlotte Flair say "I Quit" at WrestleMania Backlash.
The main issue is with booking rather than the action: If WWE are preparing a title match between Reigns and McIntyre, why have Reigns pin Riddle?
After an opening flurry by Rousey, Flair got control when she planted Rousey with a German Suplex.
Cody Rhodes pins Seth RollinsThe American Nightmare's return WrestleMania match against Seth Rollins kicked off Backlash.
