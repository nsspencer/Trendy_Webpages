     NXIVM guru wants new judge to decide evidence planting claim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Attorneys for Keith Raniere want a new federal judge to consider a motion for new trial that argues federal authorities framed the former leader of the cult-like NXIVM group by planting child pornography on a computer hard driveNEW YORK -- Attorneys for Keith Raniere, the former leader of the cult-like NXIVM group, want a new federal judge to consider a motion for new trial filed last week that argues federal authorities framed Raniere by planting child pornography on a computer hard drive.
Raniere's lawyers take aim at U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in new court papers, alleging he showed a “lack of judicial temperament” and “deep-seated, unequivocal hostility” for Raniere throughout the proceedings that landed the disgraced self-improvement guru in federal prison for 120 years for a sex-trafficking conspiracy.
“Only a new judge can fairly adjudicate any further issues in this case without these pre-existing biases and prejudices,” attorney Joseph Tully wrote in a motion Friday in Brooklyn federal court.
“Anyone who had entered the courtroom and witnessed Judge Garaufis’ outrageous comments during trial, at the restitution hearing, or at sentencing, would have concluded that the judge was biased against Mr. Raniere and his counsel.”Federal prosecutors have not yet responded to the motion to disqualify Garaufis.
They have denied Raniere's claims of government tampering with evidence.

     Detailed 'open source' news investigations are catching on
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Washington Post announced last month it was adding six people to its video forensics team, doubling its size.
Video sleuthing also contradicted an initial Pentagon story about an American drone strike that killed civilians in Afghanistan last year.
They can be investigations or experiences; The Times used security and cellphone video, along with interviews, to tell the story of one Ukraine apartment house as Russians invaded.
The Times used satellite images to quickly disprove Russian claims that atrocities committed in Ukraine had been staged.
Browne said the goal of his unit's reporting is to create stories with impact that touch upon broader truths.

     Workers grapple with new stresses as they return to office
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As more companies mandate a return to the office, workers must readjust to pre-pandemic rituals like long commutes, juggling child care and physically interacting with colleagues.
But 41% of returned workers say the amount of stress they experience has worsened; 22% say it’s gotten better and 37% say it hasn’t changed.
Thirty-five percent say the way things are going in general has gotten worse, while 20% say it’s gotten better.
Fifty percent say their stress has worsened, while just 11% say it’s gotten better; 39% say there’s no difference.
At least half of in-person workers say balancing responsibilities, potential COVID exposure at work, their commute and social interaction are sources of stress.
