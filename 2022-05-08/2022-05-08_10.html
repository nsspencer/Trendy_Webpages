     Watch Kendrick Lamar Transform Into Kanye West, Jussie Smollet, Will Smith, and Nipsey Hussle in New Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The video begins simply enough, with Lamar rapping looking slightly off camera against a maroon backdrop.
This continues for the rest of the video, with him taking on the visages of Kanye West, Jussie Smollett, Will Smith—all notably in the news for recent problematic behavior.
In the final verse, Lamar takes on two fallen Los Angeles giants: Kobe Bryant and Nipsey Hussle.
(Which tracks, since most of “The Heart” songs precede a new project.)
A picture Lamar posted last week implies the new project is actually a double album; there's surely a lot more to come in the days leading up to its release.

     Kendrick Lamar Shares New Song “The Heart Part 5,” Deepfakes Kanye, OJ, Will Smith in Video: Watch

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s a new Kendrick Lamar song in the world.
In the video, directed by Dave Free and Lamar, the rapper’s face morphs into several deepfakes, including OJ Simpson, Will Smith, Jussie Smollett, Kobe Bryant, Kanye West, and Nipsey Hussle.
The lyrics often align with the person he’s resembling, discussing bipolar disorder when he’s West and murder when he’s the late Hussle.
Earlier this year, it was reported that Lamar was producing a new live action comedy alongside the duo.
In August of last year, Lamar launched his Oklama site with a note discussing his longtime label.

     Kendrick Lamar Brings Deepfake Deep Truths to ‘The Heart Part 5’ Music Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kendrick Lamar has finally released a track from the upcoming Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers.
It’s also the rapper’s first new song as lead artist since 2018.
“The Heart Part 5” is, as you can infer from the title, the fifth in Lamar’s “The Heart” series.
Starting in 2010 with “The Heart Part 1,” these songs have been a space for Lamar to muse on everything, particularly his identity in relation to other artists.
Lamar deepfakes his way into these personae, and the video gives special thanks to “Matt Stone, Trey Parker, and DEEP VOODOO.” Deep Voodoo is the name of Matt and Trey’s deepfake studio, which they previously used to make “Sassy Justice.”Related
