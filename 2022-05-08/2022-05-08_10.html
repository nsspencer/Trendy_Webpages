     Max Homa’s 180-degree transformation on full display in gritty Wells Fargo win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “It's the hardest thing I found in learning about all this stuff, or reading about all this stuff, about happiness and gratitude,” he said at the Genesis Invitational in February.
“I can only speak for my life, but in this life it’s competitive, and I'm raised to step on someone's throat and win at all costs and whatever.
Now it's also like I'm just supposed to be happy for the opportunity.
So there's a blend, but I think it comes from—there's a great book called The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success and one of them is the law of detachment … when you pretty much are OK with whatever happens and you can only just put in what you can put in and you control what you can control.
If you can get peace through that, then the rest of it just becomes its own competition and its own fun.”

     Max Homa Wins Wells Fargo Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I just feel like life's good," Homa said afterward.
This is the second time Homa has won the Wells Fargo Championship, having also won the event in 2019 for his first PGA Tour victory.
Homa now has two wins in the 2021-20 season after winning the Fortinet Championship in Napa, Calif., back in September.
But after just four holes Homa had a two-stroke lead, thanks largely to Bradley's double bogey on No.
But Bradley could not make up that one stroke on the final two holes when Homa played solid golf..

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadMax Homa stepped to the final tee Sunday at the Wells Fargo Championship holding the slimmest possible lead over Keegan Bradley.
As the winner of the Fortinet Championship in September, he became one of five players this season with multiple victories.
Bradley then topped his second shot, all but ending any hope of winning for the first time in five tries when holding the third-round lead.
Homa did not hit into any of them but missed his approach right and into the rough.
The 38th-ranked player in the world had gotten into trouble on the hole with a drive that sailed into the right rough, leaving a downhill lie in soggy grass.

As well, he became the fifth multiple winner on the PGA Tour this season.
I knew he was never going to go away and I just tried to keep hitting good shots.
The 2011 PGA Championship winner had an up-and-down day with two double bogeys, three bogeys and five birdies.
Overall it’s been a good weekend, a decent week, something to build on going into the PGA (Championship in two weeks).
