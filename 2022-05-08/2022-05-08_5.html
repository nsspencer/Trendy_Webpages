    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 of 6WWE kicked off the night's action with one of many WrestleMania rematches when Cody Rhodes faced Seth Rollins.
It seemed as if he was successfully getting inside Rhodes' head at first.
Like their WrestleMania match, they picked up the pace as they went and got the crowd hyped for every big moment.
They paced themselves well so they could sell when they needed to without feeling like the momentum of the match was dying.
Rollins managed to get his foot on the rope to avoid a pin after taking the Cross Rhodes.

     WWE WrestleMania Backlash 2022 recap &amp; reactions: The Bloodline dynasty has emerged
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bloodline did everything in their power to keep Riddle in the match.
WWE didn’t give us a lot of Roman and Drew, but just enough to whet the appetite.
Roman’s obvious apprehension in fighting Drew is a great wrinkle, while Drew will dive headfirst into any challenge without thinking.
Whatever I missed on Monday, Edge and AJ more than made up for it at WrestleMania Backlash.
Cody’s offense came in fits and spurts through the first two acts of the match, but Seth answered every challenge.

     WWE WrestleMania Backlash 2022 Results, Full Recap and Analysis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It appeared that WWE was setting up a future WWE Universal Championship match between Reigns and McIntyre, which you would think would mean McIntyre wins the non-title tag match at WrestleMania Backlash.
After unsuccessfully gunning for the title at WrestleMania, she managed to make Charlotte Flair say "I Quit" at WrestleMania Backlash.
The main issue is with booking rather than the action: If WWE are preparing a title match between Reigns and McIntyre, why have Reigns pin Riddle?
After an opening flurry by Rousey, Flair got control when she planted Rousey with a German Suplex.
Cody Rhodes pins Seth RollinsThe American Nightmare's return WrestleMania match against Seth Rollins kicked off Backlash.
