     The Real Winners and Losers from 2022 WWE WrestleMania Backlash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 0 of 4Credit: WWE.comWhile it shared a name with The Most Stupendous Two-Night Event in WrestleMania History, WrestleMania Backlash did not feel as special as last month's show.
With just six matches on this card, it was up to a small section of the WWE roster to deliver.
Cody Rhodes continued his hot streak in WWE by defeating Seth Rollins again, and Omos put on the best performance of his career to date against Bobby Lashley.
Many names got a major boost from this show, but the short card left many forgotten on the night.
WWE Backlash has always been a moment to set a new path post-WrestleMania, and this show gave many a chance to be true winners or losers going into the summer and beyond.

There are no matches announced for this pre-show, but it’s not inconceivable they could add one, considering there are only six matches set for the main card.

     Biggest Takeaways from WWE WrestleMania Backlash 2022 Results
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And much of that can be attributed to the best version of The Almighty we have seen to date.
Five years ago, Lashley would not have been able to have a match as solid as he did against Omos.
He was not as good or as comfortable as he is with his position in WWE as he is now.
Look no further than the spot that saw The Nigerian Giant break the Hurt Lock and the crowd break out in a chant of "Bobby" as he tried to fight his way back into the contest.
It was Omos' best match but it was a defining one for Lashley, who proved he is a top-tier performer and deserving of screen time, exposure and accolades.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It appeared that WWE was setting up a future WWE Universal Championship match between Reigns and McIntyre, which you would think would mean McIntyre wins the non-title tag match at WrestleMania Backlash.
After unsuccessfully gunning for the title at WrestleMania, she managed to make Charlotte Flair say "I Quit" at WrestleMania Backlash.
The main issue is with booking rather than the action: If WWE are preparing a title match between Reigns and McIntyre, why have Reigns pin Riddle?
After an opening flurry by Rousey, Flair got control when she planted Rousey with a German Suplex.
Cody Rhodes pins Seth RollinsThe American Nightmare's return WrestleMania match against Seth Rollins kicked off Backlash.

     Summary: Ronda Rousey badly needs a victory at WWE WrestleMania Backlash.
(Credit: George ... [+] Napolitano/MediaPunch /IPX) George Napolitano/MediaPunch/IPxWWE is in the midst of a post-WrestleMania 38 lull, and WrestleMania Backlash isn’t going to change that.
Let’s examine five smart booking moves WWE must make at WrestleMania Backlash 2022.
Bobby Lashley Is Protected In DefeatWhen it comes to Bobby Lashley vs. Omos, WWE finds itself between a rock and a hard place.
Still, WWE needs to protect him at WrestleMania Backlash, or else it risks him eventually turning into the dancing version of The Great Khali.
