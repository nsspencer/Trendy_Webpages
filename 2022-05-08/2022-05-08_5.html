     Summary: Manchester City are hosting Newcastle at the Etihad after having a great night of sleep.
City is the obvious favorite to get the win here, but it wouldn’t be the first time they’d have lost points against a lesser side.
Since then, Pep Guardiola’s side has won out its schedule and currently sits second—tied on points with Liverpool—with the game against Newcastle in hand.
The last time the lads defeated Manchester City was back in Jan. 2019 when they dumped a couple on Guardiola’s side while only getting scored on one time themselves.
