     Ncuti Gatwa Is the New ‘Doctor Who’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ncuti Gatwa, a star of the Netflix series “Sex Education,” will be the 14th actor and the first Black man to play the title role in “Doctor Who,” the long-running British science fiction franchise about a time-traveling adventurer, the BBC announced on Sunday.
He replaces Jodie Whittaker, who announced her departure last July after three seasons as the show’s first female doctor.
Mr. Gatwa, 29, a Rwandan-Scottish actor, plays Eric Effiong, a gay man navigating his sexuality and identity in a religious Nigerian family, in “Sex Education,” the hit British teen comedy-drama series on Netflix.
“It feels really amazing, it’s a true honor,” Mr. Gatwa told the BBC on Sunday as he arrived for the EE British Academy Film Awards, commonly known as the BAFTAs, where he was nominated for best male performance in a comedy program for his work on “Sex Education.”

     New ‘Doctor Who’ star is ‘Sex Education’ actor Ncuti Gatwa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (AP) — Ncuti Gatwa will take the mantle from Jodie Whittaker on “Doctor Who,” the BBC announced Sunday, ending speculation over the iconic Time Lord’s next regeneration.
The Rwanda-born, Scotland-raised Gatwa, 29, will be the first Black actor to helm the quintessential British sci-fi show, but he won’t be the first Black Doctor — Jo Martin has played “Fugitive Doctor” in several episodes.
In addition to seeing the start of Gatwa’s tenure, next year also marks Davies’ return to “Doctor Who” after more than a decade’s absence.
“Russell T Davies is almost as iconic as the Doctor himself and being able to work with him is a dream come true,” Gatwa said.
“Unlike the Doctor, I may only have one heart but I am giving it all to this show,” Gatwa added.

     Summary: 'Sex Education' actor Ncuti Gatwa will be the first Black lead in 'Doctor Who'Enlarge this image toggle caption Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty ImagesActor Ncuti Gatwa will play the role of The Doctor in the show Doctor Who, the BBC announced Sunday, in a historic casting selection that marks the first time a Black person has been cast to star in the show's central role full-time.
The 29-year-old Gatwa, best known for his work in the Netflix series Sex Education, is also among the youngest Doctors yet.
In Netflix's warm-hearted series Sex Education, Gatwa plays the vibrant Eric Effiong, a gay high school student.
In 2020, a Black person played a variation of the Doctor role for the first time when Jo Martin was cast as the Fugitive Doctor.
"Ncuti dazzled us, seized hold of the Doctor and owned those TARDIS keys in seconds."
