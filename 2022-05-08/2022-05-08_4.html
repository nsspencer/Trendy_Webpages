     Summary: If City can get over the line in the Premier League, though, they will confirm themselves as the dominant force in English football.
Manchester City are on the cusp of back-to-back Premier League titles for the second time in five years.
James Gill - Danehouse/Getty ImagesFlights back from Madrid on Thursday morning were full of supporters concerned that the chastening experience in the Champions League might prompt an implosion in the title race, but by the time Sterling scored after 19 minutes, chants of "champions, champions" were reverberating around the Etihad.
"Hopefully we can arrive at the Aston Villa game on the final day of the season with the destiny of the Premier League in our hands.
An inexplicable collapse in a Champions League semifinal is a hard thing to get over, but another Premier League triumph -- potentially back-to-back titles for a second time in five years -- is more than just a consolation.

IMAGO / PA Images “I heard earlier today that (Paul) Pogba is looking at a new house in Manchester.
Now I’m thinking, ‘That’s weird, why would he need to move house to join (Manchester) City?’.
It has also been recently reported by Jason Burt of the Telegraph that ‘initial talks’ have already taken place to make the Manchester United academy graduate a Manchester City player during the upcoming summer transfer window.
