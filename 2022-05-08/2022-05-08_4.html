    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MANCHESTER (Reuters) – Manchester City reclaimed top spot in the Premier League with a 5-0 drubbing of Newcastle United that allowed the reigning champions to open up a three-point lead over Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.
Sterling eased any early jitters with a header and Laporte’s tap-in gave City full control before the interval.
Newcastle’s Chris Wood spurned a great chance to give his side an early lead but the visitors were no match for City who took an important step towards a fourth title in five seasons.
City have 86 points to Liverpool’s 83 with both sides having three games remaining and City now have a superior goal difference.
Liverpool face Aston Villa on Tuesday with City up against Wolverhampton Wanderers a day later.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City have retaken sole possession of first place in the 2021-22 Premier League standings following their routine 5-0 victory over visiting Newcastle United on Sunday.
Newcastle entered Sunday's match having won four of their previous five league contests, but the Magpies weren't able to muster much against a well-oiled City side still reeling from their Champions League exit a few days earlier.
Instead, the Sky Blues re-asserted their status as the front runners to claim the league title, boasting 72 percent possession and outshooting their visitors 17-7.
City hold a three-point lead over Liverpool with three matches remaining for both clubs.
The Sky Blues have games against Wolves, West Ham and Aston Villa to end the campaign, while Liverpool's final three matches are against Aston Villa, Southampton and Wolves.

Both sides have three games left to play and City now also have a four-goal superior goal difference.

     Summary: Manchester City are hosting Newcastle at the Etihad after having a great night of sleep.
City is the obvious favorite to get the win here, but it wouldn’t be the first time they’d have lost points against a lesser side.
Since then, Pep Guardiola’s side has won out its schedule and currently sits second—tied on points with Liverpool—with the game against Newcastle in hand.
The last time the lads defeated Manchester City was back in Jan. 2019 when they dumped a couple on Guardiola’s side while only getting scored on one time themselves.

     Summary: If City can get over the line in the Premier League, though, they will confirm themselves as the dominant force in English football.
Manchester City are on the cusp of back-to-back Premier League titles for the second time in five years.
James Gill - Danehouse/Getty ImagesFlights back from Madrid on Thursday morning were full of supporters concerned that the chastening experience in the Champions League might prompt an implosion in the title race, but by the time Sterling scored after 19 minutes, chants of "champions, champions" were reverberating around the Etihad.
"Hopefully we can arrive at the Aston Villa game on the final day of the season with the destiny of the Premier League in our hands.
An inexplicable collapse in a Champions League semifinal is a hard thing to get over, but another Premier League triumph -- potentially back-to-back titles for a second time in five years -- is more than just a consolation.

     Summary: Earlier this week, Mike Keegan and Sami Mokbel of the Daily Mail stunned many by breaking the story around Manchester City being interested in Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba’s signature this summer.
Italian transfer expert Fabrizio Romano had also claimed that Manchester City officials have ‘internally’ discussed the prospect of signing the 29-year old on a free transfer, following the expected expiry of his Manchester United contract.
IMAGO / PA Images “I heard earlier today that (Paul) Pogba is looking at a new house in Manchester.
Now I’m thinking, ‘That’s weird, why would he need to move house to join (Manchester) City?’.
It has also been recently reported by Jason Burt of the Telegraph that ‘initial talks’ have already taken place to make the Manchester United academy graduate a Manchester City player during the upcoming summer transfer window.
