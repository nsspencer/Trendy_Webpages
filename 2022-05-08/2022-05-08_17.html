    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Many people think it’s easy to pick NASCAR winners and there are some on social media falsely boasting about having a streak of winning picks.
I can’t find a single person, so far, that has jumped on a winning streak this season in NASCAR.
For a favorite driver pick, who has four wins and an average finish of 7.1, Hamlin is a lock for me.
Harvick’s overall average finish at Darlington is 12.4 and his odds to win the race today stand at 22 to 1 or +2200.
My longshot pick this week is “That Jones Boy” because he knows how to find Victory Lane at Darlington.

     Summary: After Logano gave Byron’s Chevrolet a jolt entering Turn 3 on the white-flag lap, Byron shot up the track into the outside wall and fell back to 13th at the finish.
Logano now has won at least one race in 11 consecutive Cup Series seasons.
“Yeah, you’re not going to put me in the wall and not get anything back,” Logano said, apparently referring to earlier contact from Byron’s car.
Logano’s victory in a Ford kept Chevrolet winless at Darlington since Harvick’s victory there in 2014.
NOTE: There were no issues in NASCAR’s post-race inspection, confirming Joey Logano as the winner in the No.
