     Heika's Take: Stars have officially 'flipped the switch' to playoff mode
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Everybody tries to play for the win and try not to let the puck go into our net.
Jake Oettinger looked like he was interfered with on the play, so the Stars challenged and asked for a league review.
The appeal was denied, the goal counted, and Dallas then had to kill a penalty for delay of game.
Because the Stars have been inconsistent, and because the fan base easily could've started to worry, a positive sign was needed.

     Afterwords: Breaking Down the Offense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stars Goal #1: Radek Faksa TipThis wasn’t exactly a set play off the faceoff, but it was pretty darn close.
Stars Goal #3: Pavelski Mops Up (Again)Fast forward to the third period and the Stars are finally able to score on the power play.
Much like his previous goal, Pavelski is able to pounce on a pad-save rebound and get it into the net.
Stars Goal #4: The Empty NetterNot much to say here — it’s an empty netter.
Splitting the first two games essentially gave Dallas home-ice advantage in a five game series, and they capitalized with their first.
