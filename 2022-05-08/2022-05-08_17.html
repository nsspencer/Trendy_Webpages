     Veteran fighter Donald Cerrone out of UFC 274 because of food poisoning
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX -- Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone's return to the Octagon will have to wait.
The 39-year-old veteran was scheduled to return from a one-year layoff on Saturday, in a lightweight bout against Joe Lauzon at UFC 274 inside Footprint Center.
Cerrone (36-16) was pulled from the bout hours before, however, because of food poisoning.
He felt ill the following morning and was pulled from the event after UFC physicians checked him.
A welterweight fight between Randy Brown and Khaos Williams was promoted from the UFC 274 prelims to its main card.
