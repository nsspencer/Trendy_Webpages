     Watch Kendrick Lamar Transform Into Kanye West, Jussie Smollet, Will Smith, and Nipsey Hussle in New Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The video begins simply enough, with Lamar rapping looking slightly off camera against a maroon backdrop.
This continues for the rest of the video, with him taking on the visages of Kanye West, Jussie Smollett, Will Smith—all notably in the news for recent problematic behavior.
In the final verse, Lamar takes on two fallen Los Angeles giants: Kobe Bryant and Nipsey Hussle.
(Which tracks, since most of “The Heart” songs precede a new project.)
A picture Lamar posted last week implies the new project is actually a double album; there's surely a lot more to come in the days leading up to its release.

Slyly replying to a February tweet that read: "Kendrick Lamar is officially retired," Lamar linked out to the website Oklama.com, announcing the album's title "Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers."
Lamar dismissed the claims and posted a video on the Instagram account of Top Dawg CEO, Anthony Tiffith, to proclaim his loyalty.
But Lamar has not released a solo album since his 2017 multi-platinum smash, “Damn,” which earned a best rap album Grammy.

     Kendrick Lamar Brings Deepfake Deep Truths to ‘The Heart Part 5’ Music Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kendrick Lamar has finally released a track from the upcoming Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers.
It’s also the rapper’s first new song as lead artist since 2018.
“The Heart Part 5” is, as you can infer from the title, the fifth in Lamar’s “The Heart” series.
Starting in 2010 with “The Heart Part 1,” these songs have been a space for Lamar to muse on everything, particularly his identity in relation to other artists.
Lamar deepfakes his way into these personae, and the video gives special thanks to “Matt Stone, Trey Parker, and DEEP VOODOO.” Deep Voodoo is the name of Matt and Trey’s deepfake studio, which they previously used to make “Sassy Justice.”Related
