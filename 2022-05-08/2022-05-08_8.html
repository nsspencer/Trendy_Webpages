     Kendrick Lamar releases new song “The Heart Part 5,” new album out this week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kendrick Lamar's long-awaited album Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers comes out this Friday (5/13), and he's just released his first new song since 2018, "The Heart Part 5."
The song comes with a video directed by Kendrick and Dave Free, in which Kendrick raps the song in front of a red backdrop, and as the song goes on, his face morphs into O.J.
Kendrick has said Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers will be his last album for TDE.
Kendrick also recently posted a new teaser for the album featuring a photo of two CDs, one titled "Morale" and one titled "Steppers."
No word yet if this song will be on the album, but the previous four "The Heart" songs have been non-album tracks.

     Kendrick Lamar Shares New Song “The Heart Part 5,” Deepfakes Kanye, OJ, Will Smith in Video: Watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s a new Kendrick Lamar song in the world.
In the video, directed by Dave Free and Lamar, the rapper’s face morphs into several deepfakes, including OJ Simpson, Will Smith, Jussie Smollett, Kobe Bryant, Kanye West, and Nipsey Hussle.
The lyrics often align with the person he’s resembling, discussing bipolar disorder when he’s West and murder when he’s the late Hussle.
Earlier this year, it was reported that Lamar was producing a new live action comedy alongside the duo.
In August of last year, Lamar launched his Oklama site with a note discussing his longtime label.

     Kendrick Lamar Brings Deepfake Deep Truths to ‘The Heart Part 5’ Music Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kendrick Lamar has finally released a track from the upcoming Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers.
It’s also the rapper’s first new song as lead artist since 2018.
“The Heart Part 5” is, as you can infer from the title, the fifth in Lamar’s “The Heart” series.
Starting in 2010 with “The Heart Part 1,” these songs have been a space for Lamar to muse on everything, particularly his identity in relation to other artists.
Lamar deepfakes his way into these personae, and the video gives special thanks to “Matt Stone, Trey Parker, and DEEP VOODOO.” Deep Voodoo is the name of Matt and Trey’s deepfake studio, which they previously used to make “Sassy Justice.”Related
