     Max Homa Wins Wells Fargo Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I just feel like life's good," Homa said afterward.
This is the second time Homa has won the Wells Fargo Championship, having also won the event in 2019 for his first PGA Tour victory.
Homa now has two wins in the 2021-20 season after winning the Fortinet Championship in Napa, Calif., back in September.
But after just four holes Homa had a two-stroke lead, thanks largely to Bradley's double bogey on No.
But Bradley could not make up that one stroke on the final two holes when Homa played solid golf..

     Summary: By signing up to the newsletter you agree to receive emails from golfmagic.com that may occasionally include promotional contentRising PGA Tour star Max Homa has revealed he has enlisted the help of renowned putting coach Phil Kenyon to fine-tune his green reading.
At the Zurich Classic of New Orleans a few weeks ago, Homa found out that his green-reading was some way off.
"So little things like that are really helping me."
"So Phil and my coach Mark, I was at his place this past weekend, we went through it all, too.
"It was pretty obvious when I saw how poorly I was reading greens at least in New Orleans [at the Zurich Classic]."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadMax Homa stepped to the final tee Sunday at the Wells Fargo Championship holding the slimmest possible lead over Keegan Bradley.
As the winner of the Fortinet Championship in September, he became one of five players this season with multiple victories.
Bradley then topped his second shot, all but ending any hope of winning for the first time in five tries when holding the third-round lead.
Homa did not hit into any of them but missed his approach right and into the rough.
The 38th-ranked player in the world had gotten into trouble on the hole with a drive that sailed into the right rough, leaving a downhill lie in soggy grass.
