     Max Verstappen holds off challenge of Charles Leclerc to win Miami F1 GP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By the time the chequered flag flew, Max Verstappen was unequivocal that he and his Red Bull team deserved a drink of their own having edged Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc into second place.
With this, his third win of the season, Leclerc’s lead to Verstappen was cut from 27 to 19 points.
The two title protagonists were once more quickly into a race of their own but Ferrari and Leclerc were under the cosh.
It was not perhaps quite the spectacle Miami had been hoping for but on this form Ferrari and Leclerc need to find more to take the fight to Verstappen.
Verstappen played the leading role in that success story and indeed now in F1’s racing history in the sunshine state.
