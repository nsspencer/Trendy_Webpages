    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More human remains have been found in Lake Mead as the lake continues to recede amid drought conditions.
Human skeletal remains were found Saturday at Callville Bay in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area in Nevada, according to reports from local station KLAS-TV.
The discovery comes a week after boaters found buried in mud a barrel containing skeletal remains.
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said they feared finding more human remains as the lake continues to recede.
AdvertisementThe lake — which serves more than 25 million people across California, Arizona, Nevada and Mexico — is at a historical low level, depleted by rising temperatures and drought.

     More human remains found in Lake Mead amid historic low water levels
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More human remains have been found at Lake Mead less than a week after authorities discovered the remains of a man in a barrel amid a drought that has dropped the reservoir's water level to historic lows.
A witness saw human skeletal remains in the Calville Bay area of Lake Mead around 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, the National Parks Service said.
National Park Service rangers found the barrel with skeletal remains in an area near Hemenway Harbor on May 1 after boaters spotted it.
The bodies have become uncovered as Lake Mead's water level dropped to 1,055 feet, the lowest since 1937, a year after Hoover Dam created the reservoir.
Lake Mead and Lake Powell are the largest human-made reservoirs in the United States, diverting water from the Colorado River to 40 million people in seven states, tribal nations, and Mexico.
