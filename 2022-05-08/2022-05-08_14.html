     Miami F1 Grand Prix 2022 Results: Max Verstappen Holds Off Charles Leclerc for Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AP Photo/Tyler TateMax Verstappen cruised to his third checkered flag of 2022 after winning the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.
Verstappen passed Charles Leclerc early in the race and then didn't look back from there.
Leclerc ultimately finished nearly four seconds behind Verstappen in what proved to be a two-horse race.
The Spanish Grand Prix outside of Barcelona is on tap for F1 on May 22.
He complained about his tires around the midway point, which summed up how he didn't have the car to compete with Verstappen, Leclerc, Sainz and Valtteri Bottas.

     Max Verstappen steals the show from Hollywood’s elite by beating Charles Leclerc in tense battle at the Miami Grand Prix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In front of a star-studded audience, a late safety car made sure Max Verstappen again stole the show by beating Charles Leclerc at the Miami Grand Prix.
Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz rounded out the podium after a battle with Red Bull No.2 Sergio Perez, while Lewis Hamilton was beaten to fifth in an awkward battle with teammate George Russell.
Championship leader Leclerc’s race looked as good as over as Verstappen crafted an unassailable lead, and he wasn’t the only one.
Verstappen and Leclerc again crossed swords, but the Red Bull man prevailed as his car’s supreme straight-line speed put paid to the threat of his title rival.
Verstappen and Leclerc, though, were once again in a different class, with another flawless display from the Dutchman cutting Leclerc’s lead to just 19 points.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With this, his third win of the season, Leclerc’s lead to Verstappen was cut from 27 to 19 points.
The two title protagonists were once more quickly into a race of their own but Ferrari and Leclerc were under the cosh.
He enjoyed a more than two-second advantage by lap 12 and held his lead through the only pitstops.
It was not perhaps quite the spectacle Miami had been hoping for but on this form Ferrari and Leclerc need to find more to take the fight to Verstappen.
Verstappen played the leading role in that success story and indeed now in F1’s racing history in the sunshine state.
