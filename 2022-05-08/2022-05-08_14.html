     Soccer-Champions PSG held to draw as they let two-goal lead slip
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS (Reuters) – Champions Paris St Germain let a two-goal lead slip for a second successive Ligue 1 game as they were held 2-2 by Troyes at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.
It was third successive draw for PSG, who secured the Ligue 1 title a fortnight ago, and a precious point for Troyes, now six points clear of the relegation places with two games left to play in this campaign.
In stoppage time at the end of the game, Lionel Messi struck the woodwork as Troyes grimly hung on for a potentially precious point.
Olympique de Marseille moved to second placed with a 3-0 win at Lorient earlier on Sunday.
They are 12 points behind the Parisians, who now have 80 points.

     PSG held to 2-2 draw; Marseille restores 3-point lead in 2nd

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APPARIS (AP) — French champion Paris Saint-Germain threw away a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 with 15th-place Troyes in another disappointing performance on Sunday.
Midfielder Florian Tardieu stepped up to beat goalkeeper Keylor Navas with a neat Panenka-style penalty for modest Troyes, which was promoted last season.
Earlier, Marseille showed it can cope without injured playmaker Dimitri Payet, winning 3-0 at Lorient and restoring its three-point lead in second place and the automatic Champions League spot.
Marseille scored through striker Bamba Dieng in the 39th minute, midfielder Matteo Guendouzi shortly after halftime and left winger Gerson in the 67th.
Lens moved into seventh place after winning 2-1 at Reims, with striker Florian Sotoca grabbing his second goal of the game in injury time.

     Summary: When Di Maria wasn't shooting he was crossing from the same position, and his wicked delivery led to PSG's opener, with Marquinhos effectively miscontrolling the ball beyond Moulin for 1-0 (6').
A loose Marco Verratti pass might have let Troyes back into the game, but Renaud Ripart pulled his effort wide from the edge of the box (10').
Instead, PSG pulled further clear when Neymar Jr. stepped up to convert a penalty which Kylian Mbappé had earned from Erik Palmer-Brown (25').
