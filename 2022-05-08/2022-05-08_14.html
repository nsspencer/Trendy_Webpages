     Lewis Hamilton: Extra pit stop at Miami GP felt like a gamble I didn't want to take
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hasan Bratic/picture alliance via Getty ImagesMIAMI - Lewis Hamilton said the late pit stop Mercedes offered him and he declined to take felt like an unnecessary risk as he once again bemoaned the timing of a safety car at the Miami Grand Prix.
With the safety car still out Hamilton was asked by Mercedes if he wanted to make another stop, to which he replied: "You tell me, man!
Either way, we've just been unfortunate with the timing of the safety car today."
Hamilton was complimentary of Russell's move and said the race was proof he should have started on the hard tyre, not the medium.
He was on the better tyre to start with, the hard tyre was the better tyre, so in hindsight maybe we could have started on the hard tyre.
