    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Starting the day two shots behind Bradley, Homa made that up and then some by knocking an approach to eight feet at the opening hole to make birdie, and then he grabbed another at the fifth with a sand wedge to eight feet.
Bradley, meanwhile, played the same stretch two over, including a double bogey at the par-5 second hole.
Homa then hit a 7-iron to 10 feet at the par-3 ninth for another birdie and followed it with another at the par-5 10th, courtesy of a nice pitch with his Titleist Vokey SM9 lob wedge—a club he changed the bounce and grind on three years earlier at the Wells Fargo.

     Max Homa Wins Wells Fargo Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I just feel like life's good," Homa said afterward.
This is the second time Homa has won the Wells Fargo Championship, having also won the event in 2019 for his first PGA Tour victory.
Homa now has two wins in the 2021-20 season after winning the Fortinet Championship in Napa, Calif., back in September.
But after just four holes Homa had a two-stroke lead, thanks largely to Bradley's double bogey on No.
But Bradley could not make up that one stroke on the final two holes when Homa played solid golf..

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadMax Homa stepped to the final tee Sunday at the Wells Fargo Championship holding the slimmest possible lead over Keegan Bradley.
As the winner of the Fortinet Championship in September, he became one of five players this season with multiple victories.
Bradley then topped his second shot, all but ending any hope of winning for the first time in five tries when holding the third-round lead.
Homa did not hit into any of them but missed his approach right and into the rough.
The 38th-ranked player in the world had gotten into trouble on the hole with a drive that sailed into the right rough, leaving a downhill lie in soggy grass.

     Wells Fargo payout: Max Homa, who once made $18,008 in one season, cashes $1.62 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Max Homa cashed a $1.62 million check on Sunday for winning the Wells Fargo Championship at TPC Potomac.
It was Homa's fourth career PGA Tour victory and second at the Wells Fargo following his 2019 win at Quail Hollow.
Homa has now amassed $11,694,022 in his Tour career, which is impressive considering he lost his card and was relegated back to the Korn Ferry Tour on two different occasions, most recently after the 2016-17 season.
That season, Homa made just two cuts and won just $18,008.
Here's the entire purse and FedExCup breakdown for Homa and the rest of the players who made the cut this week:

     Summary: Not when the thermometer barely got past 50 degrees the final two days of the Wells Fargo Championship.
As well, he became the fifth multiple winner on the PGA Tour this season.
I knew he was never going to go away and I just tried to keep hitting good shots.
The 2011 PGA Championship winner had an up-and-down day with two double bogeys, three bogeys and five birdies.
Overall it’s been a good weekend, a decent week, something to build on going into the PGA (Championship in two weeks).
