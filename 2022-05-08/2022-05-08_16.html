     Summary: Starting the day two shots behind Bradley, Homa made that up and then some by knocking an approach to eight feet at the opening hole to make birdie, and then he grabbed another at the fifth with a sand wedge to eight feet.
Bradley, meanwhile, played the same stretch two over, including a double bogey at the par-5 second hole.
Homa then hit a 7-iron to 10 feet at the par-3 ninth for another birdie and followed it with another at the par-5 10th, courtesy of a nice pitch with his Titleist Vokey SM9 lob wedge—a club he changed the bounce and grind on three years earlier at the Wells Fargo.

Homa now has two wins in in the 2021-20 season after winning the Fortinet Championship in Napa, Calif., back in September.
Homa began the day in second place, two strokes behind third-round leader Bradley.
But after just four holes Homa had a two-stroke lead, thanks largely to Bradley's double bogey on No.
But Bradley could not make up that one stroke on the final two holes when Homa played solid golf..
