     Patrick Mahomes, Paolo Banchero Laugh Off Interview Mixup at 2022 Miami F1 Grand Prix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lance King/Getty ImagesPaolo Banchero may have led the Duke Blue Devils' men's basketball team to the Final Four and could be the No.
Sky Sports broadcaster Martin Brundle was walking around the grid prior to Sunday's Miami Grand Prix interviewing celebrities and athletes he ran into ahead of the race.
He thought he landed Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes for what surely would have been a coveted interview.
That is especially true with the start of the race in Miami and the future ones in Las Vegas.
But, as we saw Sunday, it might take some members of the F1 world additional time to learn who the American sports stars are as well.

     F1 Commentator Martin Brundle Mistakes Paolo Banchero for Patrick Mahomes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That made for plenty of reasons to tune in on race day—but also caused a little confusion for at least one media member.
Sky Sports commentator Martin Brundle was on the track before the race began and thought he’d landed an interview with a Super Bowl champion.
Brundle apologized for the miscue, and the pair parted ways with a handshake.
After realizing the error of his ways, Brundle quickly cut the conversation short and walked away, letting out a bemused “whatever” as he reversed course.
Unsurprisingly, the moment quickly went viral, and drew plenty of boisterous responses on social media—including from Banchero and Mahomes:More Extra Mustard Coverage:

     Summary: Paolo Banchero is NOT Patrick Mahomes -- a fairly obvious fact that Martin Brundle had to learn the hard way ... live on the air, no less.
Check it out -- you see Brundle spot who he thinks is PM, and shouts out his name ... only to be ignored by Paolo.
When he finally catches up to him though ... he gets his interview.
I can’t get enough of Martin Brundle pic.twitter.com/dJP0EGd3Zi — Wu-Tang Is For The Children (@WUTangKids) May 8, 2022 @WUTangKidsAfter a few seconds, MB realizes Paolo isn't Pat ... and sorta apologizes as Paolo goes on his way.
This interview didn't go so great either, though ... but made for good TV.

     Summary: And while Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes did make the trip to Miami, he wasn’t around for Sky Sports reporter Martin Brundle’s gridwalk.
Brundle thought he scored an interview with Mahomes about the Miami Grand Prix experience, and he realized about midway through the conversation that he wasn’t talking to Mahomes.

Banchero could be an NBA star one day, but he is decidedly not Patrick Mahomes.

     Paolo Banchero confused for Patrick Mahomes in incredibly awkward F1 interview

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 pick in the NBA draft Paolo Banchero was among the athletes and celebrities in attendance on Sunday to watch the Miami Grand Prix Formula 1 race.
Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes also took in the festivities but did not partake in an interview, as one reporter thought.
Sky Sports reporter Martin Brundle took to the grid to interview those celebrities walking around, and ran across a person he thought was Mahomes.
As it turned out, though, the subject of the interview was not Mahomes — it was Banchero.
The moment certainly proved to be tough to watch but Banchero and Mahomes each made the best of it.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 overall prospect in the 2022 NBA Draft class from the very start of the cycle.
Banchero is a lock to be a top-three NBA draft pick in June, but not everyone knows his name yet.
Case in point: F1 announcer Martin Brundle thought he was talking to a different star athlete when he interviewed Banchero at the 2022 Miami Grand Prix.
Brundle apparently thought he was talking to Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes.
Instead, Banchero feels destined to be an NBA star.

     Summary: (Photo by John E. Moore III/Getty Images)The worlds of Patrick Mahomes and Paolo Banchero collided at the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday thanks to an all-time snafu by F1 reporter Martin Brundle.
F1 reporter Martin Brundle thought Paolo Banchero was Patrick MahomesIn one of the toughest looks in recent memory — and a true all-timer — Brundle kept referring to the person he was speaking to as Patrick Mahomes.
“I thought I was talking to somebody else” He thought Paolo Banchero was Pat Mahomes 💀💀 pic.twitter.com/SZcdnWNbxw — Complex Sports (@ComplexSports) May 8, 2022Banchero had some fun with the goof once it started to go viral.

He managed to combine Patrick Mahomes, Duke basketball, and F1 into one content creation dream come true.
