     How Ime Udoka, Celtics are handling Ben Simmons' potential Nets return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON -- Celtics head coach Ime Udoka raised a few eyebrows last Thursday when he admitted his coaching staff hadn't spent any time preparing for the possibility of Ben Simmons playing in their first-round NBA playoff series against the Brooklyn Nets.
After all, Udoka spent a full season with Simmons on the 2019-20 Philadelphia 76ers as an assistant coach.
Celtics big man Al Horford also was on that Sixers team -- which faced Boston in the first round of the 2020 NBA playoffs.
So, Udoka feels the Celtics should have a pretty good handle on Simmons if he makes his Nets debut during this series.
"We'll start to talk about him if it becomes a possibility," Udoka said Wednesday at TD Garden before Game 2.

     Kevin Durant Explains Kyrie Irving-Celtics Feud Is ‘Rooted in Love’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Heading into Game 2 of the Nets vs. Celtics series, Kevin Durant was asked about how Boston fans have been treating their former player, Kyrie Irving.
During Game 1 on Sunday, the Boston crowd expressed its feelings for Irving, booing or shouting chants at him.
“There’s an emotional attachment that they have to professional sports,” Durant said.
The Celtics reached the NBA Conference Finals in the 2017–18 season, losing to Irving’s previous team, the Cavaliers.
The Nets face the Celtics on Wednesday night in Game 2 as the Celtics lead the series 1–0.

     NBA playoffs picks, best bets: Why Celtics can take Game 2 vs. Nets, even if Kevin Durant bounces back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the 2021-22 NBA regular season now in the books, the basketball betting market is hotter than ever.
Sam Quinn will make at least one pick for every game between now and the NBA Finals.
Lost in the disappointment of Kevin Durant's 9-for-24 shooting night in Game 1 were the several other unsustainable factors that led to Brooklyn's near-upset in Game 1.
Brooklyn's supporting cast probably isn't going to shoot 21 of 34 on the road again.
Call me crazy, but I doubt these two teams are going to combine to shoot 22.6 percent on 3's again.

     Celtics vs. Nets score: Boston rallies in fourth quarter, sinks Brooklyn in Game 2 for 2-0 series lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Celtics take a commanding 2-0 series lead over the Brooklyn Nets after grinding out a 114-107 win Wednesday night.
The Nets took command of this game early on, working up a 17-point lead at one point, but after halftime the Celtics buckled down and began executing on offense.
Jayson Tatum hit clutch shots down the stretch and finished the night with 19 points, 10 assists and six rebounds, while Jaylen Brown tacked on another 22 points in the win.
It was really a balanced attack from the Celtics as all five starters scored in double figures, and Grant Williams came up big off the bench with 17 points.
The series will now shift to Brooklyn for the next two games, as the Nets try and get back in this series against a dominant Boston team.

     How clutch are the Celtics compared to other playoff teams?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum's Game 1 buzzer beater joins a hallowed list of clutch Celtics playoff moments!
If we look at clutch play compared to where teams are seeded in the playoffs, the Celtics are a huge outlier.
Of the eight teams that have home-court advantage in the first round, Boston is the only team that finished below 12th in clutch win percentage.
On paper, Brooklyn was a superior clutch team compared to Boston during the regular season; the Nets finished 22-20 in 42 games that included clutch time and outscored its opponents by 36 points in 163 clutch minutes (the Celtics were minus-25 in 166 clutch minutes).
Brooklyn also has the top clutch scorer in the series as Kevin Durant (109) finished with 12 more clutch points than Tatum (97) despite playing 29 fewer clutch minutes this season.

I’m sure the Nets will adjust and negate some of the effect the Celtics defense had on him in Game 1 and so the Celtics need to be ready for it.
Reports are that Simmons is playing 4 on 4 and may make his return in Game 3 or Game 4.
The Celtics averaged 46.1 rebounds per game (5th) while the Nets averaged 44.4 rebounds per game (13th) in the regular season.
X-FactorsHome Game - The Celtics are once again at home for Game 2 but the Nets are a very good road team.
