     Ben Simmons' Injury Status For Nets-Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ben Simmons has been ruled out for Game 2 between the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday evening, but according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, he could return as soon as Game 3 or 4.
The Brooklyn Nets are in Boston to take on the Celtics for Game 2 of their first-round series on Wednesday evening, and for the game Ben Simmons remains ruled out.
However, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, he could return as soon as Game 3 or 4.
Wojnarowski's second tweet said: "Game 3 hasn’t been fully ruled out yet, but that would require Simmons to clear more hurdles in a much shorter window of time, sources said."
The Celtics have a 1-0 lead in the series after winning Game 1 on Jayson Tatum's buzzer beater on Sunday afternoon.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the 2021-22 NBA regular season now in the books, the basketball betting market is hotter than ever.
Sam Quinn will make at least one pick for every game between now and the NBA Finals.
Lost in the disappointment of Kevin Durant's 9-for-24 shooting night in Game 1 were the several other unsustainable factors that led to Brooklyn's near-upset in Game 1.
Brooklyn's supporting cast probably isn't going to shoot 21 of 34 on the road again.
Call me crazy, but I doubt these two teams are going to combine to shoot 22.6 percent on 3's again.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum's Game 1 buzzer beater joins a hallowed list of clutch Celtics playoff moments!
If we look at clutch play compared to where teams are seeded in the playoffs, the Celtics are a huge outlier.
Of the eight teams that have home-court advantage in the first round, Boston is the only team that finished below 12th in clutch win percentage.
On paper, Brooklyn was a superior clutch team compared to Boston during the regular season; the Nets finished 22-20 in 42 games that included clutch time and outscored its opponents by 36 points in 163 clutch minutes (the Celtics were minus-25 in 166 clutch minutes).
Brooklyn also has the top clutch scorer in the series as Kevin Durant (109) finished with 12 more clutch points than Tatum (97) despite playing 29 fewer clutch minutes this season.

     Summary: April 20, 2022 at 11:11 PM EDTThe Bulls couldn’t have scripted a better first half than what they just assembled on the road in Game 2 against Milwaukee.
The Bulls also are doing a fairly decent job rebounding, limiting the Bucks’ transition and defending without fouling.
It’s unlikely the Bulls run away with this game.
It’s a return to an early season recipe for success that called for the Bulls to generate turnovers and turn opponent mistakes into points.
In a 14-point game at halftime, the Bulls have scored 13 points off Bucks turnovers.
