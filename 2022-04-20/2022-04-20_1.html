The Celtics own a 2-0 series lead, and Game 3 is Saturday (7:30 p.m.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum's Game 1 buzzer beater joins a hallowed list of clutch Celtics playoff moments!
If we look at clutch play compared to where teams are seeded in the playoffs, the Celtics are a huge outlier.
Of the eight teams that have home-court advantage in the first round, Boston is the only team that finished below 12th in clutch win percentage.
On paper, Brooklyn was a superior clutch team compared to Boston during the regular season; the Nets finished 22-20 in 42 games that included clutch time and outscored its opponents by 36 points in 163 clutch minutes (the Celtics were minus-25 in 166 clutch minutes).
Brooklyn also has the top clutch scorer in the series as Kevin Durant (109) finished with 12 more clutch points than Tatum (97) despite playing 29 fewer clutch minutes this season.

     NBA playoffs picks, best bets: Why Celtics can take Game 2 vs. Nets, even if Kevin Durant bounces back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the 2021-22 NBA regular season now in the books, the basketball betting market is hotter than ever.
Sam Quinn will make at least one pick for every game between now and the NBA Finals.
Lost in the disappointment of Kevin Durant's 9-for-24 shooting night in Game 1 were the several other unsustainable factors that led to Brooklyn's near-upset in Game 1.
Brooklyn's supporting cast probably isn't going to shoot 21 of 34 on the road again.
Call me crazy, but I doubt these two teams are going to combine to shoot 22.6 percent on 3's again.

Tatum dropped in a wide-open floater that gave the Celtics an eight-point lead and a stranglehold on Game 2.
Seth Curry’s 3-pointer at the start of the fourth quarter felt like it might start an avalanche.
In the fourth quarter, Brown buried a 3-pointer, then drove straight into Andre Drummond and finished a brutally difficult layup that tied the game.
“I was thrilled when he told me he was coming to a game,” Tatum said.

     Summary: Coming off a dramatic series opener, the Celtics will use their solidarity-driven momentum to seek a 2-0 lead in their Eastern Conference first-round series Wednesday night when they play host to the Brooklyn Nets.
The Celtics aim to win the first two games of a first-round playoff series for the fourth time in five seasons.
Last year, they were overmatched against Brooklyn's star trio of Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving and lost the first-round series in five games.
Especially in the first game of a series," Tatum said.
"We have to look at ourselves in the mirror as a team and just see where we can control the little things, the little details to be able to close out the game," Irving said.

     Summary: When the game mattered most, the Brooklyn Nets superstar duo folded and the Boston Celtics dominated the fourth quarter to seal a 2-0 first-round series lead.
The Nets went with the same starting lineup they used in Game 1: Irving, Curry, Durant, Brown, and Andre Drummond.
After scoring 12 of Brooklyn’s first 16 points, Brown took a seat on the bench, and Durant got going.
Despite Grant Williams scoring the last eight points of the quarter for Boston, the Nets held a 33-24 lead after one.

Celtics defense gave K.D.
But on Wednesday night, Durant didn't look like the guy who's typically unstoppable as he struggled heavily to get into any sort of rhythm.
That's insane, and you have to tip your hat to the Celtics defense.
