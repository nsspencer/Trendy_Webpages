     49ers' Deebo Samuel reportedly requests trade: What we know and which teams could be in play
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel has requested a trade, according to multiple reports.
Sources told The Athletic's Jeff Howe Samuel wasn't expected to participate in on-field work as voluntary offseason workouts began this week.
After he was traded to the Miami Dolphins, Tyreek Hill agreed to a four-year, $120 million extension with $72.2 million guaranteed, sources confirmed.
Samuel led the NFL in yards per catch (18.2) last season while playing a career-high 16 games.
Samuel had 154 receiving yards and 137 rushing yards in three playoff games.
