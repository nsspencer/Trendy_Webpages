     World Cannabis Day 2022: History, significance and more about why 4/20 is celebrated

     Summary: The day 4/20 is celebrated by the smokers and non-smokers as a holiday for the cannabis culture.
The day 4/20 is celebrated by the smokers and non-smokers as a holiday for the cannabis culture.
According to Steven Hager, a former editor of the marijuana-focused news outlet High Times, the ritual was started by five high school teenagers from San Francisco in the 1970s.
They used to meet after the extracurricular activities of the school were over and smoke marijuana by a wall at around 4:20 pm.
Some mark the day to smoke weed and have fun with others and some observe the day to push forward legalisation for legalising marijuana.

The high schoolers, engaging in an activity that was strictly illegal at the time, started to use “420” as code for marijuana, Time reported.
A 2009 article in the New York Times corroborates the history of 420 reported in Time.
Support for legalizing marijuana for medicinal use, and even recreational use, has been growing in the last several years.

     What is 420 Day? How the day is linked to weed and what Happy 420 means
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But how did the holiday originate, what does the term 420 mean, and why do people wish each other a Happy 420?
It gets its name from the way Americans write out the date–as they write the month before the day, April 20 becomes 4/20.
Aside from the annual celebration, the term “420” is also used to refer to smoking weed generally.
It is thought that 420 originated in California in 1971, when high school students would meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke weed and search for cannabis plants in the woods.
The San Rafael High School students, who called themselves the Waldos, would meet at a wall outside their school after sports practice every day–at exactly 4.20pm.

     Summary: The origins of how 4:20, the time of day, and later the date 4/20, became secret code for cannabis consumers began 50 years ago.
Editors' note: While cannabis has been legalized for medical and even recreational use in some states, marijuana and products containing TCH are still a Schedule I drug in others.
This device works with Banana Brothers' charcoal-activated filters that cool the smoke and preserve the flavor.
AeroGarden AeroGarden may not advertise its indoor pod gardens for growing cannabis, but that doesn't mean it can't be done.
Note that cannabis should only ever be grown at home in states and regions where it is legal to do so.
