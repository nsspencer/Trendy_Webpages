     NFL rumors: Deebo Samuel's 49ers trade request about usage, not money
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday, Samuel told ESPN's Jeff Darlington he has requested a trade from the 49ers and no longer wishes to play in San Francisco.
That request happened more than a week ago, NFL Media's Ian Rapoport reported.
Rapoport reported that Samuel's main issue with the 49ers comes with how he's used and not the zeroes attached to his future paychecks.
From NFL Now: For more than a week, the #49ers have been dealing with a major issue in their WRs room, as Deebo Samuel requested a trade.
But with the 2022 NFL Draft one week away, news of the trade request leaking will at least smoke out offers.

     Summary: Deebo Samuel has requested a trade from the 49ers, according to ESPN’s Jeff Darlington.
Samuel told ESPN over the phone that he has asked San Francisco to deal him somewhere else but did not elaborate why.
According to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, Samuel requested a trade over a week ago and money is not the root of the demand, but Samuel does has an issue with how he’s utilized with the 49ers.
The 49ers don’t have to trade Samuel, but if they entertained a deal, the Texans would be a suitor, according to The Athletic’s Tim Kawakami.

     Deebo Samuel requests 49ers to trade him; WR unwilling to engage in contract talks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deebo Samuel's transformation into an explosive hybrid weapon in San Francisco could prove to be short-lived.
Samuel has requested a trade from the 49ers, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday.
Unlike other receivers who have created drama this offseason, Samuel's issue with the 49ers is not related to money.
Shanahan deployed Samuel as both a receiver and a versatile backfield weapon, handing him the ball as a running back and confusing defenses.
From Weeks 10-18, Samuel saw an average of 6.6 carries per game, gaining 42.9 rushing yards per contest while scoring seven rushing touchdowns.

     Star receiver Deebo Samuel asks San Francisco 49ers to trade him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- For the past few months, the San Francisco 49ers have repeatedly said they'd like to keep wide receiver Deebo Samuel for a long time.
Samuel, who is entering the final year of his rookie contract, told ESPN's Jeff Darlington that he has asked the 49ers to trade him.
"Like I've long said, those guys are going to be a part of us for a long, long time," Lynch said.
Aside from Samuel, the Niners' current receiver group consists of Brandon Aiyuk, Jauan Jennings, Ray-Ray McCloud, Malik Turner and Marcus Johnson.
In three seasons with the Niners, Samuel has 167 receptions for 2,598 yards and 10 touchdowns with 550 rushing yards and 11 scores on the ground.

     Deebo Samuel landing spots: Five possible destinations for 49ers All-Pro receiver after reported trade request
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Another chapter was added to the wildest offseason in NFL history on Wednesday, with 49ers All-Pro receiver Deebo Samuel reportedly requesting a trade out of San Francisco.
A first-round pick in next week's draft would surely be part of any trade involving Samuel.
Similar to New York, the Lions also have two first-round picks: the second overall and the final selection on Day 1.
2 overall pick to acquire one of the NFL's most versatile players and biggest playmakers.
The Lions would probably not have to include much else in a trade involving the second overall pick.

     4 teams that should trade for Deebo Samuel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday it was reported that wide receiver Deebo Samuel, who finished last season with over 1,700 total yards and 14 touchdowns, has asked the 49ers for a trade.
Cleveland would love a top-tier receiver to pair with Deshaun Watson, but no longer have the assets to make a deal after their mammoth trade.
The 49ers aren’t in a rush to make the deal, but should they decide to go for it, here are the teams I think have the space, and the need to pull the trigger on a Deebo Samuel trade.
If Zach Wilson can’t succeed with Deebo Samuel in the offense, then you might as well start looking at pulling the plug.
The Packers need a top-tier receiver if they hope to compete, and this could be their out.
