     Steelers Odds to Land Deebo Samuel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pittsburgh Steelers are in the running for Deebo Samuel.
With Deebo Samuel's recent trade request from the San Francisco 49ers, plenty of NFL teams will be looking to add the offensive star, including the Pittsburgh Steelers.
While the Steelers aren't the favorites to land Samuel through a trade, they aren't out of the running.
Samuel, 26, is coming off a 1,700-yard season where he contributed as a receiver and running back for the 49ers.

     The Atlanta Falcons must pursue dynamic WR Deebo Samuel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dec 19, 2021; Santa Clara, California, USA; San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel (19) runs with the football during the second quarter against the Atlanta Falcons at Levi's Stadium.
The draft involves a lot of luck, however, Atlanta could instead trade for a proven player that has requested a trade from his current team.
Deebo Samuel is a player the Atlanta Falcons need to pursueDeebo Samuel could fix the Falcons’ wide receiver room all by himself, he is a special talent that seems to be on the trade market now.
From NFL Now: For more than a week, the #49ers have been dealing with a major issue in their WRs room, as Deebo Samuel requested a trade.
Think about what he would bring to the Falcons, a player who can line up anywhere and will physically dominate the opposition after the catch.

     Trading for Deebo Samuel would be a bold move by the Detroit Lions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In my perfect world, the Detroit Lions would finally buck the narrative of settling to remain mediocre and make a bold move; but that’s not generally the Lions’ way.
Should the Detroit Lions trade for Deebo Samuel?
Last season Samuel totaled 1,405 yards receiving on 77 catches, good for 18.2 yards per reception and six receiving touchdowns.
Pairing Samuel with Amon-Ra St. Brown, DJ Chark, Hockenson, and Swift with that potentially spectacular offensive line, the Detroit Lions could suddenly possess a consistent top 15 offense in 2022.
If the Detroit Lions were able to acquire Samuel for the no.

     Deebo Samuel requests trade: 10 potential landing spots for San Francisco 49ers' star wide receiver
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Detroit has the draft capital (in the 32nd and 34th overall picks) and money to pay Samuel.
To this point, Lions GM Brad Holmes has been shrewd in his rebuild, favoring short deals with upside that don't commit long-term money.
With considerable work to do across the roster, would Holmes toss that approach out the window to acquire Deebo?
A trade wouldn't be cheap in draft assets and future cap space.
But a Lions trade for Samuel would suggest that Holmes' rebuild timeline is ahead of schedule.

     Deebo Samuel trade rumors: Here's the main reason why the 49ers star wants out of San Francisco, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When 49ers star Deebo Samuel made his trade demand on Wednesday, he didn't offer any specific reason for wanting out of San Francisco.
During the 2021 season, Samuel had a historical year while playing both wide receiver and running back.
With 1,770 scrimmage yards, Samuel accounted for 28% of the 49ers' offensive total, which was the fourth-highest percentage by any player in the NFL.
"Deebo Samuel wants to be a receiver and not a receiver-slash-running back," Pelissero said in an interview with Rich Eisen.
"Reporters jobs is to make stories only people know the truth about situation is 49ers, [my agent Tory Dandy], and Deebo Samuel," the 49ers star wrote.

     Summary: Per ESPN’s Jeff Darlington, San Francisco 49ers star wide receiver Deebo Samuel has requested to be traded.
But getting Deebo Samuel on the roster is the equivalent of drawing the “fast forward four spots” card in a board game.
Among the teams to consider as the trade market for Deebo Samuel heats up: The #Jets, the #Packers, the #Chiefs, the #Lions… and, I assume, most other teams who like really good players.
Lions get: Deebo Samuel49ers get: 2nd pick and 34th pickThe Lions, 49ers, and Samuel all get what they want here.
In Samuel, the Lions will get the kind of impact player they aren’t likely to get at Pick 2 or 34.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY, Wis. – The Green Bay Packers are a Super Bowl-caliber team without a star receiver.
It’s special to watch because you don’t really see guys be able to maximize their YAC the way that he does.
The Packers, with two first-round picks and two second-round picks, have the capital to get it done.
The Packers are fighting significant salary cap issues.
The Value of Draft PicksThe best way to beat the salary cap is with an influx of quality players on rookie contracts to help provide some balance to one of the NFL’s most top-heavy salary structures.
