     Summary: Governor Candidate Kwanza Hall on 420 Day and the state of unfair and unpopular criminalization of marijuana in GeorgiaAtlanta, Ga. – While many Americans are celebrating and wishing one another a happy 420 Day, unfortunately in Georgia there is not much to be happy about.
But Georgia is one of only 19 states where simple possession can still land you in jail.
Yet 71% of Georgia residents support making cannabis legal and the state’s cannabis policies are remarkably out of step with the opinion of our citizens.
Black Georgians and white Georgians use cannabis at a nearly identical rate, but Black Georgians are three times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession.
