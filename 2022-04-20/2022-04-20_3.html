     The Atlanta Falcons must pursue dynamic WR Deebo Samuel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dec 19, 2021; Santa Clara, California, USA; San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel (19) runs with the football during the second quarter against the Atlanta Falcons at Levi's Stadium.
The draft involves a lot of luck, however, Atlanta could instead trade for a proven player that has requested a trade from his current team.
Deebo Samuel is a player the Atlanta Falcons need to pursueDeebo Samuel could fix the Falcons’ wide receiver room all by himself, he is a special talent that seems to be on the trade market now.
From NFL Now: For more than a week, the #49ers have been dealing with a major issue in their WRs room, as Deebo Samuel requested a trade.
Think about what he would bring to the Falcons, a player who can line up anywhere and will physically dominate the opposition after the catch.

     Deebo Samuel Reportedly Doesn’t Want to Be Dual Receiver, Rusher
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Deebo Samuel requested a trade from the 49ers, reported on Wednesday by ESPN’s Jeff Darlington, it wasn’t clear at first why the wide receiver wanted to leave San Francisco.
“It sounds like there’s multiple layers to this, but certainly one of them is Deebo Samuel wants to be a receiver and not a receiver/running back,” Pelissero said on The Rich Eisen Show.
With these statistics, Samuel led the 49ers in receiving yards, and he also had the second most rushing yards behind Elijah Mitchell.
It appears that Samuel wants to go to a team that doesn’t have running back or wide receiver issues, a team where he can solely play the role of wide receiver.
“In the big picture, it sounds like the role is part of the reason that Deebo wants to play somewhere else,” Pelissero said.

     Deebo Samuel requests trade: 10 potential landing spots for San Francisco 49ers' star wide receiver
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Detroit has the draft capital (in the 32nd and 34th overall picks) and money to pay Samuel.
To this point, Lions GM Brad Holmes has been shrewd in his rebuild, favoring short deals with upside that don't commit long-term money.
With considerable work to do across the roster, would Holmes toss that approach out the window to acquire Deebo?
A trade wouldn't be cheap in draft assets and future cap space.
But a Lions trade for Samuel would suggest that Holmes' rebuild timeline is ahead of schedule.

     Trading for Deebo Samuel would be a bold move by the Detroit Lions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In my perfect world, the Detroit Lions would finally buck the narrative of settling to remain mediocre and make a bold move; but that’s not generally the Lions’ way.
Should the Detroit Lions trade for Deebo Samuel?
Last season Samuel totaled 1,405 yards receiving on 77 catches, good for 18.2 yards per reception and six receiving touchdowns.
Pairing Samuel with Amon-Ra St. Brown, DJ Chark, Hockenson, and Swift with that potentially spectacular offensive line, the Detroit Lions could suddenly possess a consistent top 15 offense in 2022.
If the Detroit Lions were able to acquire Samuel for the no.

     Star receiver Deebo Samuel asks San Francisco 49ers to trade him

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- For the past few months, the San Francisco 49ers have repeatedly said they'd like to keep wide receiver Deebo Samuel for a long time.
Samuel, who is entering the final year of his rookie contract, told ESPN's Jeff Darlington that he has asked the 49ers to trade him.
"Like I've long said, those guys are going to be a part of us for a long, long time," Lynch said.
Aside from Samuel, the Niners' current receiver group consists of Brandon Aiyuk, Jauan Jennings, Ray-Ray McCloud, Malik Turner and Marcus Johnson.
In three seasons with the Niners, Samuel has 167 receptions for 2,598 yards and 10 touchdowns with 550 rushing yards and 11 scores on the ground.

     Summary: GREEN BAY, Wis. – The Green Bay Packers are a Super Bowl-caliber team without a star receiver.
It’s special to watch because you don’t really see guys be able to maximize their YAC the way that he does.
The Packers, with two first-round picks and two second-round picks, have the capital to get it done.
The Packers are fighting significant salary cap issues.
The Value of Draft PicksThe best way to beat the salary cap is with an influx of quality players on rookie contracts to help provide some balance to one of the NFL’s most top-heavy salary structures.
