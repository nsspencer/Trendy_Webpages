     Netflix Stock’s Tumble Is a Warning to Tesla
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Predictions about more competition for Tesla are a little like Elon Musk’s predictions for fully autonomous cars.
The predictions are always around, but the reality never seems to arrive.
Now, though, competition for the electric-vehicle pioneer really is ramping up.
And Tesla (ticker: TSLA) bulls should think hard about the impact, especially consider how the horse race in streaming has dragged down Netflix (NFLX).

     Elon Musk still has his own company to run. Here’s what happened with Tesla earnings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ETadvertisementadvertisementTesla beat expectations on both earnings and revenue for the first quarter of 2022, reporting EPS of $3.22 on revenue of $18.76 billion.
Those sales comprise the vast majority of Tesla’s revenue, which analysts are predicting to be $17.7 billion—up over 70% from last year.
Tesla’s Giga Shanghai factory suspended work on March 28, due to strict COVID-19 containment measures amid a rise in the country’s cases.
While it’s not uncommon for manufacturing plants in China to have dormitories for workers, Tesla’s factory is not currently equipped with such living spaces.
If so, he could potentially end up in charge of five major companies, between Twitter, Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, not to mention any smaller ventures that pique his interest.

     Tesla earnings: Stock jumps after record profit, sales despite supply-chain woes

     Summary: Tesla Inc. late Wednesday reported another record quarter of sales and profit, blowing past Wall Street estimates even though it said its factories continue to run below capacity due to supply-chain problems.
Analysts polled by FactSet expected the company to report adjusted earnings of $2.26 a share on sales of $17.85 billion.
He declined to give more details about the robotaxi, saying Tesla likely will hold an event to highlight the new vehicle next year.
Tesla said in the letter that supply-chain problems and raw-material prices costs that recently have increased “multiple-fold” continue to weigh.
The ramp up in the newer factories also will depend on the supply-chain snags, Tesla said.

     Tesla: Why I'm Not Selling A Single Share (NASDAQ:TSLA)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moreover, Tesla's stock has several positive catalysts, including a constructive technical setup, significant growth prospects, and an upcoming stock split.
I'm not selling a single share prior to earnings, as this constructive backdrop should power Tesla's stock to new ATHs.
I'm projecting that the company's gross margin will come in at about 28%, and the company's operating margin could be around 17% this quarter.
Even if we remove regulatory credits from the equation, Tesla's operating margin can still be about 16%, in my view.
I'm not selling a single Tesla share, as I expect the stock to outperform going into earnings here and longer-term.
