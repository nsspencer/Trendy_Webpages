     What Is 420? Here's Why April 20 Is Associated With Marijuana
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While several different explanations have been given, a definitive reason of why 420 is associated with marijuana has yet to be determined.
The then-high school students are said to have smoked marijuana every day at 4:20 p.m. and the number 420 became code for smoking the plant, with 4/20 being acknowledged for calendar purposes.
A far less popular theory traces the 420 origin to the 1939 short story In the Walls of Eryx by H.P.
Lovecraft and Kenneth Sterling, which describes "curious mirage-plants" that seem to resemble marijuana as getting the narrator high at 4:20, according to his watch, which would serve as the possible earliest documented link of marijuana to 420.
As of April 20, 2022, recreational marijuana is legal in 18 states and Washington, D.C., while medicinal marijuana is only illegal in 11 states.

But Georgia is one of only 19 states where simple possession can still land you in jail.
Yet 71% of Georgia residents support making cannabis legal and the state’s cannabis policies are remarkably out of step with the opinion of our citizens.
Black Georgians and white Georgians use cannabis at a nearly identical rate, but Black Georgians are three times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession.
