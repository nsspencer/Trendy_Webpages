     420 Day: Lt. Governor Kwanza Hall Calls Georgia Marijuana Laws “Unfair’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Governor Candidate Kwanza Hall on 420 Day and the state of unfair and unpopular criminalization of marijuana in GeorgiaAtlanta, Ga. – While many Americans are celebrating and wishing one another a happy 420 Day, unfortunately in Georgia there is not much to be happy about.
But Georgia is one of only 19 states where simple possession can still land you in jail.
Yet 71% of Georgia residents support making cannabis legal and the state’s cannabis policies are remarkably out of step with the opinion of our citizens.
Black Georgians and white Georgians use cannabis at a nearly identical rate, but Black Georgians are three times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession.
You may not know about the Shafer Commission nor its report that was issued in 1972, and for good reason.

     Summary: And why do weed aficionados hold April 20 and 4:20 p.m. so sacred?
The high schoolers, engaging in an activity that was strictly illegal at the time, started to use “420” as code for marijuana, Time reported.
A 2009 article in the New York Times corroborates the history of 420 reported in Time.
Support for legalizing marijuana for medicinal use, and even recreational use, has been growing in the last several years.
A poll released by Elon University last year showed that 54% of North Carolinians backed legalizing marijuana completely, and 73% supported legalizing medical marijuana.
