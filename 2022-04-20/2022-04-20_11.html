     Review: I was wrong about 'Russian Doll.' Here's why you should watch Season 2.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I have to admit, I was wrong about "Russian Doll."
And like any mature adult (Nadia at the end of Season 1, rather than the beginning), I can admit when I'm wrong.
After revisiting (and loving) the first season, I worried the second season (now streaming, ★★★½ out of four) might not live up to what felt like a complete, full-circle story.
"Doll" didn't really need to come back, but Lyonne and the writers found a way to advance the story without ruining it.
Trying to recapture old glory is often a fool's errand, especially in Hollywood where sequels, remakes and remakes of remakes wring every good idea dry.

     Russian Doll Season 2 Ending Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In any case, if Russian Doll season 1 was about self-acceptance and overcoming guilt, season 2 was about understanding how the past shapes who we are for better or worse.
Nadia realizes that by not living in the present, she has missed being at Ruthie’s bedside in her final moments.
But it’s not that simple, and as usual, the transient sage Horse speaks the central truth as he leads Nadia and Alan to their awakening.
For Alan, there is a less satisfying resolution that may at first puzzle some Russian Doll viewers.
Perhaps the better lesson for Alan is that he could love someone like Lenny, putting his failed relationship with Beatrice last season in a new light.

     Russian Doll review – did we need this second season? Yes, yes, yes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fans will remember that Russian Doll resolved its time-loop crisis in the end, when Nadia and fellow frequent death sufferer Alan (Charlie Barnett) finally came together, which begs the question of what a second season could do.
Once again, Lyonne takes the spotlight here and, by all accounts, the family-based storyline that runs through this season is personal.
I adore this series, and adore this season, though I do appreciate that its quirks may not be for everyone.
Lyonne has said that if the first season was about how not to die, the second is about how to live.
There are few television series that I want to watch again, and even fewer that I want to watch again immediately after the final credits roll.

     This Week in TV: ‘Russian Doll,’ ‘Barry,’ ‘Ghosts’ Finale

     Summary: Two critical favorites that have had looong hiatuses return to screens this week as Netflix’s Russian Doll (which has been away for more than three years) and HBO’s Barry (just under three years) begin new seasons.
It would be next to impossible to watch everything, but let THR point the way to worthy options for the coming week.
The Big ShowRussian Doll sent its lead character, Nadia (Natasha Lyonne, who also co-created the series) on a mind-bending time-loop journey in its first season.
Nothing in this season is quite as compulsively entertaining as the first season’s recurring fatalities,” writes THR critic Daniel Fienberg.

     ‘Russian Doll’ didn’t need a second season, but the series pulls it off beautifully
    </h2>

     Summary: Given how firmly it closed its circular plot, and the relatively peculiar particulars of its narrative — “relatively” since it ran on an engine oft-lifted from “Groundhog Day” — it’s somewhat surprising to see a second season of “Russian Doll,” the excellence of its 2019 first season notwithstanding.

“Russian Doll” turns somersaults to get where it’s going, but its conclusions are emotionally unambiguous and universally useful and consonant with the previous season’s themes of attachment and surrender.
And if its sentimental streak is leavened with skepticism, sentiment is what makes “Russian Doll” valuable and skepticism what keeps the sentiment bearable.

     Summary: Music supervisor Brienne Rose and composer Joe Wong discuss adjusting the series' musical makeup for Nadia's new challenges in Season 2.
It’s a celebration of the fact that “Russian Doll” is back and weirder than ever.
“We definitely wanted [the music of Season 2] to feel like its own universe separate from Season 1,” Rose said.
The music itself, the melodic motifs, are able to be nested inside of one another in like a contrapuntal, fugue-like way.
So they’re like a Russian doll.”Sign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

     Russian Doll Recap: Nora Doesn’t Live Here Anymore
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Nadia spends more time in the past, Russian Doll commits to 1980s aesthetics.
In the previous episode, Vera noticed that Nora was acting differently, and that’s because Nora was Nadia at the time.
The growing body-horror element could be another manifestation, although we might also view the merging of Nadia and Nora as a tale of possession.
In the final third of the episode, Nora somehow splinters off from Nadia and accuses Vera of putting bugs under her skin and lying about the mold in her apartment.
