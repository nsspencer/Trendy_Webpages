    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Music supervisor Brienne Rose and composer Joe Wong discuss adjusting the series' musical makeup for Nadia's new challenges in Season 2.
It’s a celebration of the fact that “Russian Doll” is back and weirder than ever.
“We definitely wanted [the music of Season 2] to feel like its own universe separate from Season 1,” Rose said.
The music itself, the melodic motifs, are able to be nested inside of one another in like a contrapuntal, fugue-like way.
So they’re like a Russian doll.”Sign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

     Summary: Netflix’s Russian Doll isn’t just a job for the cast and crew.
Nadia, Natasha’s character, goes inside and keeps discovering that layer,” Poehler told THR.
“We talked about the theme of the show as trying to figure out: What is your little core Russian doll?
And, how did we end up this way?” Russian Doll star Greta Lee told THR.
“Something utterly mundane suddenly feels like, ‘Is it worth risking my life for?’ We’re all going through this kind of new world together.”Just like Russian Doll.

     ‘Russian Doll’ didn’t need a second season, but the series pulls it off beautifully
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Given how firmly it closed its circular plot, and the relatively peculiar particulars of its narrative — “relatively” since it ran on an engine oft-lifted from “Groundhog Day” — it’s somewhat surprising to see a second season of “Russian Doll,” the excellence of its 2019 first season notwithstanding.

“Russian Doll” turns somersaults to get where it’s going, but its conclusions are emotionally unambiguous and universally useful and consonant with the previous season’s themes of attachment and surrender.
And if its sentimental streak is leavened with skepticism, sentiment is what makes “Russian Doll” valuable and skepticism what keeps the sentiment bearable.

     Russian Doll Recap: Derailed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With “Exquisite Corpse,” Russian Doll makes its biggest journey yet — to Budapest in 1944, not long before the Soviet army invaded the city.
Nadia boarded a 6 train intending to go to 1982, probably planning to pry open some floorboards at Vera’s apartment.
I’ve been trying to figure out the broad strokes of how time travel works in Russian Doll.
While he consciously chose to board that train, he didn’t know where (or when or to whom) he was going.
• Russian Doll has always been built around Natasha Lyonne’s exceptional performance, but there’s greater variation in “Exquisite Corpse.” She inhabits multiple roles and times, capturing Nadia’s emotional highs and lows with aplomb.

     ‘Russian Doll’ Season 2, Episode 6 Recap: Schrödinger’s Ruth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian Doll Schrödinger’s Ruth Season 2 Episode 6 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: András D. Hadjú/NetflixThis will probably sound counterintuitive given the hectic opening and mindfuck closing of the penultimate episode of Russian Doll season two, but “Schrödinger’s Ruth” presents an opportunity to catch our breath, to step back and take in the big picture before the finale.
“Schrödinger’s Ruth” shares the propulsive action of its predecessor, “The Way Out,” as well as a poignant revelation about the Nadia-Ruth relationship.
Alan isn’t the only one left behind: Until the penultimate episode, Lizzie’s role had been hardly more than a cameo.
But Russian Doll has never been strictly linear, either, so it looks as if Nadia’s getting a refresher course.
Like Alan in season two, Ruth mostly exists in service of Nadia’s story.
