     Russian Doll Season 2: Nadia’s Family History Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As is the case by definition in time travel stories, Russian Doll’s sojourns to the past aren’t perfectly linear.
Nadia darts back and forth from 2022 to 1982 in the first few episodes of season 2.
By the end of the whole experience, both the viewers and Nadia have a rough narrative of the Volvokov family history in place.
by presenting the abbreviated history of Nadia’s family in chronological order.
For the purposes of Russian Doll season 2’s saga, however, Budapest 1944 is where things start.

     ‘Russian Doll’ Cast on Working With Natasha Lyonne and Season 2’s Big Swings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix’s Russian Doll isn’t just a job for the cast and crew.
Nadia, Natasha’s character, goes inside and keeps discovering that layer,” Poehler told THR.
“We talked about the theme of the show as trying to figure out: What is your little core Russian doll?
And, how did we end up this way?” Russian Doll star Greta Lee told THR.
“Something utterly mundane suddenly feels like, ‘Is it worth risking my life for?’ We’re all going through this kind of new world together.”Just like Russian Doll.

     The Loopy Conundrum of ‘Russian Doll’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: These are the questions that face existential explorer Nadia Vulvokov (Natasha Lyonne) in the second season of Russian Doll.
Unlike Russian Doll, The Flight Attendant was announced as a limited series, only to backtrack after its initial success.
For a show only in its second season, Russian Doll is already intensely self-referential.
Meanwhile, Alan’s role ends up diminished, breaking up the unlikely soulmates that gave Russian Doll a solid foundation to its freewheeling chaos.
Russian Doll keeps spinning out, and those who wish can keep following it further down the rabbit hole.

     Russian Doll Recap: Derailed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With “Exquisite Corpse,” Russian Doll makes its biggest journey yet — to Budapest in 1944, not long before the Soviet army invaded the city.
Nadia boarded a 6 train intending to go to 1982, probably planning to pry open some floorboards at Vera’s apartment.
I’ve been trying to figure out the broad strokes of how time travel works in Russian Doll.
While he consciously chose to board that train, he didn’t know where (or when or to whom) he was going.
• Russian Doll has always been built around Natasha Lyonne’s exceptional performance, but there’s greater variation in “Exquisite Corpse.” She inhabits multiple roles and times, capturing Nadia’s emotional highs and lows with aplomb.

     ‘Russian Doll’ Season 2, Episode 6 Recap: Schrödinger’s Ruth
    </h2>

     Summary: Russian Doll Schrödinger’s Ruth Season 2 Episode 6 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: András D. Hadjú/NetflixThis will probably sound counterintuitive given the hectic opening and mindfuck closing of the penultimate episode of Russian Doll season two, but “Schrödinger’s Ruth” presents an opportunity to catch our breath, to step back and take in the big picture before the finale.
“Schrödinger’s Ruth” shares the propulsive action of its predecessor, “The Way Out,” as well as a poignant revelation about the Nadia-Ruth relationship.
Alan isn’t the only one left behind: Until the penultimate episode, Lizzie’s role had been hardly more than a cameo.
But Russian Doll has never been strictly linear, either, so it looks as if Nadia’s getting a refresher course.
Like Alan in season two, Ruth mostly exists in service of Nadia’s story.
