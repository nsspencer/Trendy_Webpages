     Tesla earnings: Stock jumps after record profit, sales despite supply-chain woes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla Inc. late Wednesday reported another record quarter of sales and profit, blowing past Wall Street estimates even though it said its factories continue to run below capacity due to supply-chain problems.
Analysts polled by FactSet expected the company to report adjusted earnings of $2.26 a share on sales of $17.85 billion.
He declined to give more details about the robotaxi, saying Tesla likely will hold an event to highlight the new vehicle next year.
Tesla said in the letter that supply-chain problems and raw-material prices costs that recently have increased “multiple-fold” continue to weigh.
The ramp up in the newer factories also will depend on the supply-chain snags, Tesla said.

     Summary: New York (CNN Business) Tesla has posted record profits once again, overcoming supply chain issues that have dogged the broader auto industry to blow away Wall Street's forecast for the company for the first quarter of 2022.
"Recent Covid-19 outbreaks have been weighing on our supply chain and factory operations," Tesla said.
Still, even with supply chain issues the company earned adjusted income of $3.7 billion, much higher than the $2.6 billion forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
"Tesla Shanghai ... is coming back with a vengeance," Musk told investors on the investor conference call.
Tesla's results are particularly impressive given the current supply chain problems, said Dan Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities.

     Summary: Tesla is set to report first-quarter earnings after the bell today, and investors seem pessimistic about what they'll hear.
But Tesla investors seem to be concerned about what the impacts to production will be from COVID-19-related lockdowns in Shanghai.
Tesla opened the Shanghai plant -- its second production facility -- in 2018, and it has been a large contributor to the company's explosive growth.
But investors are likely thinking guidance for second quarter will be hit, and that might be what is concerning them ahead of the report.
Leading up to the report, investors seem to be expecting the worst.
