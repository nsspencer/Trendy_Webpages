     Bulls vs. Bucks final score: DeMar DeRozan and Alex Caruso steer Chicago to Game 2 victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the crushing loss in Game One, the Chicago Bulls responded with one of their best performances of the season.
Then Alex Caruso stepped up with another timely defense play, drawing an offensive foul on Giannis to turn Milwaukee over.
He added a block and was one of the players who grabbed an offensive rebound in the game clinching offensive sequence.
No Bulls bench player played more than 14 minutes in this game and the unit scored a combined 10 points.
This was a humongous victory for Chicago as getting a game on the road now gives them some hope going back home.

     DeMar DeRozan’s playoff career-high lifts Bulls over Bucks in Game 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After an excruciating Game 1 loss in Milwaukee, Zach LaVine lamented the Bucks making more “winning plays” than the Chicago Bulls down the stretch.
Not only did DeRozan tally a new playoff career-high with 41 points (16-for-31 shooting), he did it on familiarly prolific shooting from his preferred zone — the midrange.
Vučević’s valueEven as he struggled to a 9-for-27 shooting line in Game 1 — 2-for-10 from 3-point range — Nikola Vučević’s importance to the Bulls’ upset chances was pronounced.
DEAR GOD WHAT A SEQUENCE pic.twitter.com/v73aE9eUvu — Bulls Talk (@NBCSBulls) April 21, 2022In all, DeRozan, Vučević and LaVine combined to score 85 of the Bulls' 114 points and shot 33-for-62 while doing so.
But the Bucks engineered multiple runs that the Bulls had to weather en route to victory.

    </h2>

     Summary: DeMar DeRozan, Nikola Vucevic, and Alex Caruso all had big contributions in the Bulls' Game 2 victory in Milwaukee.
Though now after a career playoff-high 41 points from DeMar DeRozan and another superb effort from Nikola Vucevic with 24 points and 13 rebounds, it all doesn't look so daunting.
And the Bucks said vital reserve George Hill apparently will miss the rest of the series with an abdominal injury.
Giannis Antetokounmpo almost willed the Bucks back with 33 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists.
DeMar DeRozan set a new playoff career-high with 41 points in Game 2.
