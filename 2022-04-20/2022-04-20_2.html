     Khris Middleton Sprains MCL in Game 2 vs. Bulls, MRI On Thursday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

     NBA Playoffs: Alex Caruso helping Bulls rekindle defensive 'spirit'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alex Caruso's impact was felt in every facet of the Chicago Bulls' Game 2 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Wednesday night.
"They (the Bucks) automatically have the advantage right now," Caruso told his teammates in the locker room immediately after the game.
We gotta win three more times," he said when asked the significance of the Bulls' win, which leveled the series 1-1.
Still, it's worth appreciating the Bulls' first playoff victory since 2017 for a moment — and Caruso's outsized role in the result.
Caruso is the head of that snake, the signal-caller of the Bulls' defensive attack.

     Bulls' DeMar DeRozan Delivers on Guarantee With Career-High Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeRozan delivers on guarantee with career-high night originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoMILWAUKEE --- For some players, what DeMar DeRozan said might've bordered on defiance.
Those words came Sunday night, in the wake of DeRozan's disappointing shooting performance in the Bulls' Game 1 loss to the defending NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks.
DeRozan scored a career-playoff-high 41 points Wednesday night to help the Bulls even the series with an emphatic Game 2 victory.
But DeRozan sank an 18-footer, rebounded a Khris Middleton miss and sank two free throws to push the lead back to seven by quarter's end.
In all, DeRozan sank eight of nine shots while matched against Antetokounmpo, a former Defensive Player of the Year.

     Summary: DeMar DeRozan, Nikola Vucevic, and Alex Caruso all had big contributions in the Bulls' Game 2 victory in Milwaukee.
Though now after a career playoff-high 41 points from DeMar DeRozan and another superb effort from Nikola Vucevic with 24 points and 13 rebounds, it all doesn't look so daunting.
And the Bucks said vital reserve George Hill apparently will miss the rest of the series with an abdominal injury.
Giannis Antetokounmpo almost willed the Bucks back with 33 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists.
DeMar DeRozan set a new playoff career-high with 41 points in Game 2.
