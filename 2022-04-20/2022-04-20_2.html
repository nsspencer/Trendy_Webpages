     4 trades to land the Chicago Bears Deebo Samuel or A.J. Brown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even the Chicago Bears have gotten in on some of the headlines, but not necessarily for the exciting reasons.
Samuel and Brown have made it abundantly clear to their respective teams that they are not happy.
The future of the Bears largely depends on one thing and one thing only: the development of quarterback Justin Fields.
Building around Fields is the number one thing Poles and the Bears must do.
Let’s say the 49ers or Titans were to simply listen to trade offers for either Samuel or Brown.

     Deebo Samuel, 49ers could be on the outs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesWhen 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel removed all evidence of the team from his social-media pages, it quite possibly wasn’t an act or a ruse or a negotiating ploy.
“San Francisco would pay Deebo Samuel today, tomorrow, the next day.
“This, I think right now, is Deebo Samuel not wanting to get a deal done. . . .
Deebo Samuel is the one who has put a halt to everything for right now.”Second, Deebo’s brother, Tyquan Samuel, made multiple social-media comments indicating that Deebo wants to be traded, and that he won’t be a member of the 49ers.
Coach Kyle Shanahan quite possibly thinks he could find another receiver who can do in the 49ers offense the things that Deebo Samuel currently does.

     Summary: NFL Media adds that Samuel's official request reached the 49ers front office more than a week ago, hence the two sides' halted contract talks.
"San Francisco wants to pay Deebo Samuel, but Deebo Samuel was the one who scrubbed the 49ers logos off his social media page," ESPN's Adam Schefter previously reported Tuesday.
"Deebo Samuel was the one that essentially, basically made it known he wanted to move on.

     Potential Deebo Samuel Trade Destinations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brown, Terry McLaurin, and Deebo Samuel.
Here are the teams who could acquire Deebo Samuel if the 49ers are forced into trading him:New York JetsNew York Jets receive: Deebo Samuel, 2022 sixth-round pick (187th overall)San Francisco 49ers receive: 2022 second-round pick (35th overall), 2022 second-round pick (38th overall pick), 2022 third-round pick (69th overall), 2023 third-round pickIf Deebo Samuel does get traded this offseason there is no clearer landing spot for him than the New York Jets.
They could put a bow on this offseason by trading for another wide receiver in Deebo Samuel.
After failing to acquire DeVante Parker, the Dallas Cowboys could make a blockbuster deal to acquire a star receiver like Deebo Samuel.
Deebo Samuel would not only bring a new element to this offense but he would be an upgrade over what Amari Cooper was last season.
