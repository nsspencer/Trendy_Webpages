     ASAP Rocky Arrested in Connection With Los Angeles Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York rapper ASAP Rocky was arrested on Wednesday in Los Angeles on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon stemming from an alleged nonfatal shooting last year, the police said.
The musician, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, 33, had just landed in Los Angeles following a private flight from Barbados along with his pregnant girlfriend, the pop singer and fashion entrepreneur Rihanna.
The shooting occurred in the Hollywood area on Nov. 6, 2021, around 10:15 p.m., during an argument “between two acquaintances,” the Los Angeles Police Department said in a news release.
“The argument escalated and resulted in the suspect firing a handgun at the victim,” who was later treated for a minor injury.
The Los Angeles Police Department declined to comment further.
