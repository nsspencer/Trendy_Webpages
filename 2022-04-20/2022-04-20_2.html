     What Is 420? Here's Why April 20 Is Associated With Marijuana
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While several different explanations have been given, a definitive reason of why 420 is associated with marijuana has yet to be determined.
The then-high school students are said to have smoked marijuana every day at 4:20 p.m. and the number 420 became code for smoking the plant, with 4/20 being acknowledged for calendar purposes.
A far less popular theory traces the 420 origin to the 1939 short story In the Walls of Eryx by H.P.
Lovecraft and Kenneth Sterling, which describes "curious mirage-plants" that seem to resemble marijuana as getting the narrator high at 4:20, according to his watch, which would serve as the possible earliest documented link of marijuana to 420.
As of April 20, 2022, recreational marijuana is legal in 18 states and Washington, D.C., while medicinal marijuana is only illegal in 11 states.

     420 Day: Lt. Governor Kwanza Hall Calls Georgia Marijuana Laws “Unfair’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Governor Candidate Kwanza Hall on 420 Day and the state of unfair and unpopular criminalization of marijuana in GeorgiaAtlanta, Ga. – While many Americans are celebrating and wishing one another a happy 420 Day, unfortunately in Georgia there is not much to be happy about.
But Georgia is one of only 19 states where simple possession can still land you in jail.
Yet 71% of Georgia residents support making cannabis legal and the state’s cannabis policies are remarkably out of step with the opinion of our citizens.
Black Georgians and white Georgians use cannabis at a nearly identical rate, but Black Georgians are three times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession.
You may not know about the Shafer Commission nor its report that was issued in 1972, and for good reason.

It all started with a group of five students at San Rafael High School in Marin County, California.
4/20: A new holidayExcept for obvious calendar purposes, it's unclear why April 20 became the unofficial pot smoker's holiday, according to Vox.

     Summary: And why do weed aficionados hold April 20 and 4:20 p.m. so sacred?
The high schoolers, engaging in an activity that was strictly illegal at the time, started to use “420” as code for marijuana, Time reported.
A 2009 article in the New York Times corroborates the history of 420 reported in Time.
Support for legalizing marijuana for medicinal use, and even recreational use, has been growing in the last several years.
A poll released by Elon University last year showed that 54% of North Carolinians backed legalizing marijuana completely, and 73% supported legalizing medical marijuana.

     What is 420 Day? How the day is linked to weed and what Happy 420 means
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But how did the holiday originate, what does the term 420 mean, and why do people wish each other a Happy 420?
It gets its name from the way Americans write out the date–as they write the month before the day, April 20 becomes 4/20.
Aside from the annual celebration, the term “420” is also used to refer to smoking weed generally.
It is thought that 420 originated in California in 1971, when high school students would meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke weed and search for cannabis plants in the woods.
The San Rafael High School students, who called themselves the Waldos, would meet at a wall outside their school after sports practice every day–at exactly 4.20pm.
