     No more excuses: Yankees’ Gerrit Cole needs to actually be an ace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three hours and 59 minutes later, the Yankees won 4-2 and overcame another bad Gerrit Cole outing.
Cole would mow them down and the Yankees bats would have a ball at Comerica Park.
Instead, the $324 million ace struggled with the wind and couldn’t even finish two innings.
Oh, and more complaints: Cameras caught Cole gesturing that he was struggling to grip the ball during a mound visit.
All you have to do is get the ball over the plate with this Tigers team.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After ace Gerrit Cole faltered, Clarke Schmidt stepped up and was a big reason the Yankees beat the Tigers, 4-2, at Comerica Park on Tuesday night.
“It means the world to me,” said Schmidt, a 2017 first-round pick out the University of South Carolina.
To be able to get my first career win here, it’s a very, very special moment, something that I don’t take lightly.
“It was a special moment, especially since he’s chasing such a milestone,” Schmidt said.
Schmidt said he made sure to walk over to Cabrera at second base and tell him he didn’t mean to hit him.

     Good news and bad news as Yankees’ bullpen carries team to victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Tuesday afternoon, the New York Yankees faced off against the Detroit Tigers, coming off of disappointing series against the Baltimore Orioles.
Nonetheless, let’s take a look at the good and bad news from the win on Tuesday.
Good news:Right off the bat, the Yankees’ bullpen impressed significantly after Cole was knocked out of the game in just 1.2 innings.
The bullpen, however, was phenomenal, as Clarke Schmidt lasted 3.1 innings and struck out six batters, giving up two hits.
Having relief pictures who can supplement poor starting pitching is a huge positive for a Yankees team that has struggled offensively this season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I thought he used the slider and the cutter and his fastball all really well,’ Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.
The left-hander gave up seven runs in 3 2/3 innings to his former team, Boston, during his second start this season on April 13.
Rodriguez has faced the Yankees 23 times, more than any other opponent.
Yankees ace Gerrit Cole lasted just 1 2/3 innings; he walked five and gave up two runs while throwing 68 pitches.
The Yankees scored the first two runs when a popup between the mound and home plate bounced off Alexander’s glove.

     'Disappointing': Gerrit Cole Evaluates Shortest Start of Career
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cole lasted just 1.2 innings on a chilly night in Detroit, tying his career high with five walks.
Hours earlier, the Yankees ace was yanked after just 1.2 innings pitched, the shortest start of his big-league career.
After striking out the side in the first, Cole completely lost control of the strike zone in the second.
After an abbreviated spring, Cole had yet to throw more than 85 pitches in a game this season.
"Certainly never had an inning like that in my career before," Cole said.

     Summary: Gerrit Cole lasted a career-low 1 2/3 innings, and Clarke Schmidt combined with four relievers to pitch three-hit shutout ball and lead the New York Yankees over the Detroit Tigers 4-2 Tuesday night in a series opener.
On a frigid April night in Detroit, Cole needed 46 pitches to get two outs in the second before leaving with a 3-2 lead.
"He's going to carry us for a long stretch.
Tigers starter Tyler Alexander (0-1) gave up two unearned runs, one hit and two walks in one inning, throwing 42 pitches for three outs.
"That was a brutal night for everyone who had to pitch," Tigers manager A.J.

     Yankees’ Gerrit Cole on early hook: ‘A lot of four-letter words’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DETROIT — As Aaron Boone went to the mound to take out Gerrit Cole in the second inning, the Yankees ace pounded his hand into his glove five times.
“But it’s not something we can’t get through.”Aaron Boone takes out Gerrit Cole in the second inning of the Yankees’ 4-2 win over the Tigers.
“I probably shouldn’t have left him out there as long as I did, with the weather and number of pitches,’’ Boone said.
“He had two out, and I just wanted him to get through it.”Despite the early results, Boone still has confidence in the right-hander.
Gerrit Cole gets pulled from Yankees win over the Tigers on April 19, 2022.
