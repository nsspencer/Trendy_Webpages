     Tesla earnings: Stock jumps after record profit, sales despite supply-chain woes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla Inc. late Wednesday reported another record quarter of sales and profit, blowing past Wall Street estimates even though it said its factories continue to run below capacity due to supply-chain problems.
Analysts polled by FactSet expected the company to report adjusted earnings of $2.26 a share on sales of $17.85 billion.
He declined to give more details about the robotaxi, saying Tesla likely will hold an event to highlight the new vehicle next year.
Tesla said in the letter that supply-chain problems and raw-material prices costs that recently have increased “multiple-fold” continue to weigh.
The ramp up in the newer factories also will depend on the supply-chain snags, Tesla said.
