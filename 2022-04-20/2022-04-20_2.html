     Bulls' DeMar DeRozan Delivers on Guarantee With Career-High Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeRozan delivers on guarantee with career-high night originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoMILWAUKEE --- For some players, what DeMar DeRozan said might've bordered on defiance.
Those words came Sunday night, in the wake of DeRozan's disappointing shooting performance in the Bulls' Game 1 loss to the defending NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks.
DeRozan scored a career-playoff-high 41 points Wednesday night to help the Bulls even the series with an emphatic Game 2 victory.
But DeRozan sank an 18-footer, rebounded a Khris Middleton miss and sank two free throws to push the lead back to seven by quarter's end.
In all, DeRozan sank eight of nine shots while matched against Antetokounmpo, a former Defensive Player of the Year.

"Credit to Chicago," Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said.
While Bucks fans were still pondering what was going wrong, the Bulls took an 18-point advantage early in the third quarter.

     Summary: After the crushing loss in Game One, the Chicago Bulls responded with one of their best performances of the season.
Then Alex Caruso stepped up with another timely defense play, drawing an offensive foul on Giannis to turn Milwaukee over.
He added a block and was one of the players who grabbed an offensive rebound in the game clinching offensive sequence.
No Bulls bench player played more than 14 minutes in this game and the unit scored a combined 10 points.
This was a humongous victory for Chicago as getting a game on the road now gives them some hope going back home.
