     Bulls vs. Bucks final score: DeMar DeRozan and Alex Caruso steer Chicago to Game 2 victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the crushing loss in Game One, the Chicago Bulls responded with one of their best performances of the season.
Then Alex Caruso stepped up with another timely defense play, drawing an offensive foul on Giannis to turn Milwaukee over.
He added a block and was one of the players who grabbed an offensive rebound in the game clinching offensive sequence.
No Bulls bench player played more than 14 minutes in this game and the unit scored a combined 10 points.
This was a humongous victory for Chicago as getting a game on the road now gives them some hope going back home.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MILWAUKEE – Confidence hasn’t been an issue for Patrick Williams since the day the Bulls made him the No.
That was on full display Wednesday, when Williams was discussing his ongoing showdown of drawing the Giannis Antetokounmpo defensive assignment.
Thanks to Williams and the execution of a stellar defensive game plan, the Bulls made life as difficult as a team can on Antetokounmpo, evening the best-of-seven first-round series 1-1.
Even more impressive, the Bulls not only matched the defensive intensity from Game 1, but turned it up a notch.
“We got our spirit back,’’ Caruso said of the defense that’s been played by the Bulls in this series.
