     Jerry West and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Blast HBO’s Lakers Series ‘Winning Time’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The HBO sports drama Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty has come under fire from the Lakers’ former general manager Jerry West and star center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
West, a former player and head coach, was named general manager of the LA Lakers before the 1982–83 NBA season.
Under his guidance, the team won five championship rings in the 1980s — the era covered in the HBO series.
Abdul-Jabbar was part of those winning teams, and his contributions are regarded as a vital component in the Showtime era of Lakers basketball.
Abdul-Jabbar wrote in a blog post, “[Jerry] never broke golf clubs, he didn’t throw his trophy through the window.

     Jerry West demands retraction for portrayal in HBO's 'Winning Time' series about 1980s 'Showtime' Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Lakers legend and current Los Angeles Clippers consultant Jerry West has demanded a retraction and an apology from HBO due to his portrayal in the series "Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty," according to ESPN.
"The portrayal of NBA icon and L.A. Lakers legend Jerry West in 'Winning Time' is fiction pretending to be fact -- a deliberately false characterization that has caused great distress to Jerry and his family," said Skip Miller, an attorney representing West.
"Jerry West was an integral part of the Lakers and NBA's success.
Earlier this season, West revealed that the team had revoked his lifetime season-tickets.
In 2007, Kobe Bryant publicly asked the Lakers to bring West back with full authority over basketball decisions.

“The Jerry West in Winning Time bears no resemblance to the real man.
The real Jerry West prided himself on treating people with dignity and respect.
“It shows Jerry launching into expletive-filled tirades about the decision to draft Magic, implying that Jerry had personal animus against Magic.
“All Jerry did was point out that Sidney Moncrief was a prolific scorer and that the Lakers should consider him.

     Jerry West Is the Latest Lakers Legend to Slam ‘Winning Time,’ Demands Apology and Retraction from HBO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Los Angeles Lakers player, coach, and executive Jerry West is demanding a retraction and apology from HBO and Adam McKay over his portrayal in the new series, Winning Time, ESPN reports.
In the letter, his lawyer claimed that just because the show has a disclaimer saying it’s a dramatization doesn’t shield the network from liability.
The letter from West and his lawyers arrives after Kareem Abdul-Jabbar — another Lakers legend depicted in the show — shared a scathing critique of the series.
“It’s a shame the way they treat Jerry West, who has openly discussed his struggle with mental health, especially depression,” Abdul-Jabbar wrote.
“As an act of common decency, HBO and the producers owe Jerry a public apology and at the very least should retract their baseless and defamatory portrayal of him.”
