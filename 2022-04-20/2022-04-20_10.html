     Elon Musk still has his own company to run. Here’s what happened with Tesla earnings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ETadvertisementadvertisementTesla beat expectations on both earnings and revenue for the first quarter of 2022, reporting EPS of $3.22 on revenue of $18.76 billion.
Those sales comprise the vast majority of Tesla’s revenue, which analysts are predicting to be $17.7 billion—up over 70% from last year.
Tesla’s Giga Shanghai factory suspended work on March 28, due to strict COVID-19 containment measures amid a rise in the country’s cases.
While it’s not uncommon for manufacturing plants in China to have dormitories for workers, Tesla’s factory is not currently equipped with such living spaces.
If so, he could potentially end up in charge of five major companies, between Twitter, Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, not to mention any smaller ventures that pique his interest.

     Why Investors Are Selling Tesla Ahead of Today's Earnings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla is set to report first-quarter earnings after the bell today, and investors seem pessimistic about what they'll hear.
But Tesla investors seem to be concerned about what the impacts to production will be from COVID-19-related lockdowns in Shanghai.
Tesla opened the Shanghai plant -- its second production facility -- in 2018, and it has been a large contributor to the company's explosive growth.
But investors are likely thinking guidance for second quarter will be hit, and that might be what is concerning them ahead of the report.
Leading up to the report, investors seem to be expecting the worst.

“This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions &amp; China zero Covid policy,” he wrote earlier this month.
Those wait times could remain as the China closure could cut into Tesla’s production by as many as 50,000 vehicles in the next quarter.
We are production limited.”Tesla’s China production halt began in late March.
He called the measures “fascist” and urged the government “give people back their g--d--- freedom.”Gene Munster, managing partner with Loup Ventures, said Tesla’s China factory closure signaled potential further complications.

     Summary: New York (CNN Business) Tesla shareholders have been spending a lot of time following CEO Elon Musk's grand play to buy Twitter .
Tesla earnings are expected to jump 142% from a year ago.
Here's a rundown of what to look for in its earnings report and call with investors.
Nine months ago, Musk announced he would generally stop participating in the quarterly call, saying it took too much of his time.
"The main focus of the earnings call must be around supply coming out of China," said Ives.
