     FBI Says Goodbye to Maggie: Will Missy Peregrym Return?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The FBI universe is becoming quite the revolving door, and fans likely have many questions following the emotional rollercoaster that was FBI Season 4 Episode 18.
If you watch FBI online, you know that the team found themselves on the hunt for sarin gas.
Maggie (Missy Peregrym) found herself caught up in one of the most harrowing moments of her career when she tried to reason with Hakeen Abbas.
OA (Zeeko Zaki) managed to get into the room after quite the struggle, but Maggie had already started to pass out.
Now, you're probably wondering whether Peregrym will return, and given the franchise's track record for writing out leads, we don't blame you.

     FBI Season 4: [SPOILER] Will Return After Surprise Twist
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The showrunner of CBS's FBI confirms that star Missy Peregrym will return if the series is renewed for season 5.
The series, which was created by Dick Wolf and Craig Turk, premiered on September 25, 2018, and is currently airing season 4.
The reason for this is that Peregrym is now on maternity leave, necessitating that her character be sidelined for a substantial chunk of time.
This kind of plot development designed to accommodate an actor on maternity leave is relatively common on television.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FBI season 4 spoilers follow.
FBI producer Rick Eid has explained the dramatic twist that has led to a temporary cast departure.
Missy Peregrym will miss the last four episodes of the season to go on maternity leave, but will return at some point in season five as Special Agent Maggie Bell.
After the agents split up, Bell took down Abbas in one of the abandoned labs but not before a vial of the sarin gas was spilled.
Once Bell had been rushed to the hospital, her doctors told the FBI team there was a "reasonable chance" she'd make a full recovery over time.
