     Summary: “Winning Time falsely and cruelly portrays Mr. West as an out-of-control, intoxicated rage-aholic,” the letter reads.
“The Jerry West in Winning Time bears no resemblance to the real man.
The real Jerry West prided himself on treating people with dignity and respect.
“It shows Jerry launching into expletive-filled tirades about the decision to draft Magic, implying that Jerry had personal animus against Magic.
“All Jerry did was point out that Sidney Moncrief was a prolific scorer and that the Lakers should consider him.

     Summary: Are they angered by a television show that’s playing fast and loose about actual, or made-up, events?
“The portrayal of NBA icon and L.A. Lakers legend Jerry West in ‘Winning Time’ is fiction pretending to be fact — a deliberately false characterization that has caused great distress to Jerry and his family,” wrote West’s attorney.
The funny part in this is that this is exactly what West’s character from the show would do.
“Jerry Buss is Egomaniac Entrepreneur, Jerry West is Crazed Coach, Magic Johnson is Sexual Simpleton, I’m Pompous Prick.
Magic Johnson isn’t tuning in, either.
