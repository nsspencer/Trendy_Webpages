     Summary: Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Flipboard (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Jose Alvarado may be an undrafted rookie who started on a two-way contract, but he has a signature move â€” the come-from-behind steal.
Heâ€™s done it a lot this season, lurking on the baseline then sprinting up behind an unsuspecting ball handler and getting the steal (he averaged 1.3 steals a game this season, although that included more traditional steals as well).
Alvarado tried that on Chris Paul in Game 2 on Tuesday, but CP3 is too smart and was having none of it.
CP3 told Alvarado enough is enough ðŸ¤£ pic.twitter.com/JCGYDdL1Cx â€” Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) April 20, 2022I love that Alvardo had the stones to try this on the Point God in a playoff game.
With Devin Booker out injured and Brandon Ingram being clutch, the Pelicans took Game 2 and evened the series 1-1, heading back to New Orleans.

     LOL: Chris Paul Wasnâ€™t Having Any of That Sneaky Jose Alvarado Play (Which Worked on the Bulls)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Pelicans have found a diamond in the rough in undrafted free agent rookie Jose Alvarado.
The guard out of Georgia Tech has quickly become one of the teamâ€™s most important rotation players thanks to his relentless defense.
As the opposing team would either inbound the ball or go for the easy rebound, Alvarado would sneak into the corner.
The rookie would then wait for the opponent to have his back turned before running up and going for the steal.
I guess Alvarado still got the last laugh, though, as the Pelicans pulled off the shocking 125-114 victory later that quarter.

     Chris Paul sniffed out Jose Alvaradoâ€™s sneak attack and yelled at him in the NBA Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Paul knows every trick in the book to gain even the smallest advantage over his opponents.
Heâ€™s earned his place in part because heâ€™s an incredibly pesky defensive player despite his small stature â€” just like Paul.
Alvardao has been infamous for his sneak attacks on opposing ball handlers, but he wasnâ€™t about to pull the trick on CP3.
When Avarado tried to get Paul with his signature sneaky steal attempt, CP3 immediately noticed it, yelled at Alvarado, and motioned him to go away.
