     Summary: ETadvertisementadvertisementTesla beat expectations on both earnings and revenue for the first quarter of 2022, reporting EPS of $3.22 on revenue of $18.76 billion.
Those sales comprise the vast majority of Tesla’s revenue, which analysts are predicting to be $17.7 billion—up over 70% from last year.
Tesla’s Giga Shanghai factory suspended work on March 28, due to strict COVID-19 containment measures amid a rise in the country’s cases.
While it’s not uncommon for manufacturing plants in China to have dormitories for workers, Tesla’s factory is not currently equipped with such living spaces.
If so, he could potentially end up in charge of five major companies, between Twitter, Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, not to mention any smaller ventures that pique his interest.

Analysts polled by FactSet expected the company to report adjusted earnings of $2.26 a share on sales of $17.85 billion.
He declined to give more details about the robotaxi, saying Tesla likely will hold an event to highlight the new vehicle next year.
Tesla said in the letter that supply-chain problems and raw-material prices costs that recently have increased “multiple-fold” continue to weigh.
The ramp up in the newer factories also will depend on the supply-chain snags, Tesla said.

     Summary: Tesla is set to report first-quarter earnings after the bell today, and investors seem pessimistic about what they'll hear.
But Tesla investors seem to be concerned about what the impacts to production will be from COVID-19-related lockdowns in Shanghai.
Tesla opened the Shanghai plant -- its second production facility -- in 2018, and it has been a large contributor to the company's explosive growth.
But investors are likely thinking guidance for second quarter will be hit, and that might be what is concerning them ahead of the report.
Leading up to the report, investors seem to be expecting the worst.
