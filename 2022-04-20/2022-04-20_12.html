     Moon Knight Episode 4 Ending Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With that in mind, the Lemire and Smallwood run can provide some answers to what is surely the most confusing MCU episode since WandaVision.
One of Lemire and Smallwood’s most important contributions to Moon Knight canon is reframing his mental illness.
When most creative teams would address Marc’s mental state, they would describe it as broken, as if there was a coherent whole that Marc needed to achieve.
But in Lemire and Smallwood’s run, Marc discovers that his different way of approaching the world was itself a gift, a type of special ability.
However, if the show adheres to the Lemire and Smallwood run, then something quite different is happening.

     Summary: After Steven tells Layla the truth about Khonshu wanting her as his next avatar, she finds herself attracted to his honesty, something Marc always lacked.
During the mission, Layla tells Steven about her late archeologist father, to which Steven offers his condolences, clearly unaware of Marc’s involvement in the incident.
Adding to the mystery, Marc has a whole ass Moon Knight action figure in his possession.
“We’re most excited to see how people react after Episode 4 but before Episode 5,” Benson told TVLine ahead of the show’s premiere.

     Summary: Warning: This review contains spoilers for episode 4 of Moon Knight.
Four weeks in, Moon Knight is past the midpoint of its run and well on the way to its finale.
Moon Knight Without Moon KnightAs much fun as the Steven/Layla romance is, the most compelling dynamic in the show is still Steven’s back-and-forth with his other self.
Moon Knight started off as Marvel’s riff on Fight Club, but it’s quickly turning into Marvel’s riff on Shutter Island.

     Moon Knight Episode 4: Who Was That Hippo Goddess?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This post contains detailed spoilers for Moon Knight episode 4.
As Matt Fowler explained in his Moon Knight Episode 4 review , this moment is ripped right out of the comics.
Later on, during the New Kingdom (1550–1069 BCE), the goddess’ power in the perception of the people would only grow.
So, how can a goddess mostly known for her fertility and childbirth tip the proverbial scales of Moon Knight?
Will Taweret save Marc, or will Layla (May Calamawy) be taking on the mantle of Moon Knight sooner than Khonshu planned?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This story contains spoilers for “Moon Knight” Episode 4.
The fourth episode of “Moon Knight” makes you question everything you thought you knew about the show.
Television ‘Moon Knight,’ explained: An episode-by-episode guide From characters’ comic book backstories to the Marvel series’ pantheon of Egyptian gods, keep our guide handy as you watch “Moon Knight” on Disney+.
“There’s one particular run of ‘Moon Knight’ by [Greg] Smallwood and [Jeff] Lemire that has this mind-bending, reality-questioning imagery that we based a lot of our own approach on,” explained Moorhead.
The 2016 “Moon Knight” comic book run, for example, introduced a sci-fi space pilot version of Marc Spector as a new identity.

     'Moon Knight' Episode 4, Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The following story contains heavy spoilers for Moon Knight Episode 4.
Moon Knight Episode 4, titled "The Tomb," had an enormous twist—that took us to a mental asylum.
The asylum plot takes influence from a Moon Knight comic run written by Jeff Lemire.
This twist is heavily influenced by a 2016 Moon Knight run by writer Jeff Lemire (who also wrote Sweet Tooth and several other beloved comics).
Or was this whole "Moon Knight" thing just something he made up in his head, along with these other identities he had cultivated?
