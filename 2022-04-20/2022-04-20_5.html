     Four-goal Arsenal grab huge win at Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a Premier League match that felt more like a prize fight at times, as Arsenal traded blows with Chelsea en route to a 4-2 victory at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.
From that point on it was mostly Chelsea on the front foot, with the Blues searching for an equalizer while the visitors soaked up the pressure.
Unfortunately for the hosts, Arsenal would add to the lead with a Bukayo Saka penalty kick in stoppage time and put the match out of reach.
The result puts Arsenal on equal footing with North London rivals Tottenham, with both teams sporting identical 18-3-11 records.
Spurs own the tiebreaker for the coveted fourth place spot on the table, however, and thus Arsenal will have six more matches to try to secure Champions League qualification.

     Summary: Thomas Tuchel Says Chelsea "Scored 5 Goals" In 4-2 Loss To Arsenal Before Blaming The PitchThomas Tuchel was critical of his team's defending and the Stamford Bridge pitch after Wednesday's 4-2 loss to Arsenal.
Tuchel told Sky Sports after the game: "We scored five goals and lost 4-2.
"Three own goals, two regular goals for us and one for Arsenal.
"We don't get these goals, we give these goals away here in consecutive games, you cannot win Premier League matches like that."

     Summary: APLONDON (AP) — Bukayo Saka scored his first penalty for Arsenal to complete a 4-2 victory over Chelsea on Wednesday that revived the push for Champions League qualification.
But Arsenal leveled inside four minutes after Nketiah gave away the ball and Timo Werner’s strike deflected off Granit Xhaka into the net.
Chelsea drew level again in the 32nd with Cesar Azpilicueta getting on the end of Mason Mount’s ball into the box.
Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel reacted to the first-half display by replacing Andreas Christensen with the experienced Thiago Silva in defense.
But Nketiah scored again to send Arsenal in front for a third time in the 57th.

     Summary: Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has claimed the Stamford Bridge pitch was partially to blame for Wednesday's 4-2 defeat to Arsenal.
"To say the pitch is difficult to play here it maybe sounds like an excuse, but it is a very, very difficult pitch that we have here.
A defensive performance is a team performance, and an offensive performance is a team performance.
You need to have the tactics right, which is doubtful I had this right, and you need the team selection right, again it's doubtful I had this right.
I don't see it in any other matches, but I see it now in consecutive matches of our games, and it has to stop."

     Eddie Nketiah double hands Arsenal vital win amid Chelsea chaos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This was a vibrant performance, made all the more impressive by the fact Arsenal did it without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney.
There was an excellent display in attack from Eddie Nketiah, who grabbed his first league strikes of the season.
There was danger every time Saka ran at Sarr and Marcos Alonso on the right, and Chelsea were soon behind again.
The left wing-back found Nketiah and, when Silva, Sarr and N’Golo Kanté failed to clear, the striker prodded the ball past Mendy.
Arsenal pushed on the break and the points were theirs when Azpilicueta conceded a penalty for fouling Saka, who finished confidently.
