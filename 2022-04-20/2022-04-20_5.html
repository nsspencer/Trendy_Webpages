    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Beyond this, based on our understanding of Ammit, it’s not implausible that Alexander the Great would have been her avatar.
He was a seemingly all-powerful conqueror who was able to take over hundreds of kingdoms, and in doing so, he was also beloved by many.
It’s very possible that he conquered and killed using a message of world peace, not unlike Ammit’s supposed intentions.
New episodes of Moon Knight drop every Wednesday on Disney Plus.
