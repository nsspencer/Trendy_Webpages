     Four-goal Arsenal grab huge win at Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a Premier League match that felt more like a prize fight at times, as Arsenal traded blows with Chelsea en route to a 4-2 victory at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.
From that point on it was mostly Chelsea on the front foot, with the Blues searching for an equalizer while the visitors soaked up the pressure.
Unfortunately for the hosts, Arsenal would add to the lead with a Bukayo Saka penalty kick in stoppage time and put the match out of reach.
The result puts Arsenal on equal footing with North London rivals Tottenham, with both teams sporting identical 18-3-11 records.
Spurs own the tiebreaker for the coveted fourth place spot on the table, however, and thus Arsenal will have six more matches to try to secure Champions League qualification.

     How Arsenal overcame Chelsea at Stamford Bridge: Analysis and recap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal went level on points with Tottenham in fourth after beating Chelsea 4-2 in a thriller at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea were not behind for long and equalised only four minutes later through Timo Werner.
Arsenal regained the lead before the half-hour mark after Emile Smith Rowe scored his 10th Premier League goal of the season with a low shot from 18 yards out.
In an enthralling first-half, Thomas Tuchel's side once again got onto level terms as Cesar Azpilicueta poked home Mason Mount's cross.
Nketiah then added his second of the night in the 57th minute to put Arsenal 3-2 ahead, with the result sealed when Bukayo Saka sent Mendy the wrong way from the penalty spot after being brought down by Azpilicueta.

     Summary: Thomas Tuchel Says Chelsea "Scored 5 Goals" In 4-2 Loss To Arsenal Before Blaming The PitchThomas Tuchel was critical of his team's defending and the Stamford Bridge pitch after Wednesday's 4-2 loss to Arsenal.
Tuchel told Sky Sports after the game: "We scored five goals and lost 4-2.
"Three own goals, two regular goals for us and one for Arsenal.
"We don't get these goals, we give these goals away here in consecutive games, you cannot win Premier League matches like that."
"The ball bounces very awkwardly in front of Andreas when he runs to play the ball.

     Summary: Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has claimed the Stamford Bridge pitch was partially to blame for Wednesday's 4-2 defeat to Arsenal.
"To say the pitch is difficult to play here it maybe sounds like an excuse, but it is a very, very difficult pitch that we have here.
A defensive performance is a team performance, and an offensive performance is a team performance.
You need to have the tactics right, which is doubtful I had this right, and you need the team selection right, again it's doubtful I had this right.
I don't see it in any other matches, but I see it now in consecutive matches of our games, and it has to stop."

Eddie Nketiah scored a brace to power Arsenal to a 4-2 win at Chelsea on Wednesday night.
First, Nketiah's perseverance was rewarded as he scored on 57 minutes as Malang Sarr and Silva got in a muddle.
Victory would send them above Spurs into fourth by the time Antonio Conte's side kick off at Brentford.
Nketiah delivered where Lukaku faltered.

Not for the first time in recent weeks, it was Thomas Tuchel's side that ended the game with more critical errors to its name.
"The ball bounces very awkwardly in front of Andreas when he wants to play this ball.
First of all, Ruben Loftus-Cheek stole in to claim an undercooked Nketiah pass, the ball eventually coming to Timo Werner.

Dear old Arsenal, wobbly Arsenal, fragile Arsenal, banterous Arsenal, the big six side voted most likely to tie together their own shoelaces together… they came out and they won the thing?
But what a strange season Chelsea have had, even without the whole seized-by-the-state thing.
Over in the game that nobody was watching, Manchester City kept everybody waiting just long enough.
Last night Manchester City weren't actually playing against Brighton, for Brighton — a perfectly reasonable football team — are not good enough to stop Manchester City.
