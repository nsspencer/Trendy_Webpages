    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Winning Time falsely and cruelly portrays Mr. West as an out-of-control, intoxicated rage-aholic,” the letter reads.
“The Jerry West in Winning Time bears no resemblance to the real man.
The real Jerry West prided himself on treating people with dignity and respect.
“It shows Jerry launching into expletive-filled tirades about the decision to draft Magic, implying that Jerry had personal animus against Magic.
“All Jerry did was point out that Sidney Moncrief was a prolific scorer and that the Lakers should consider him.
