     Four-goal Arsenal grab huge win at Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a Premier League match that felt more like a prize fight at times, as Arsenal traded blows with Chelsea en route to a 4-2 victory at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.
From that point on it was mostly Chelsea on the front foot, with the Blues searching for an equalizer while the visitors soaked up the pressure.
Unfortunately for the hosts, Arsenal would add to the lead with a Bukayo Saka penalty kick in stoppage time and put the match out of reach.
The result puts Arsenal on equal footing with North London rivals Tottenham, with both teams sporting identical 18-3-11 records.
Spurs own the tiebreaker for the coveted fourth place spot on the table, however, and thus Arsenal will have six more matches to try to secure Champions League qualification.

     Summary: Thomas Tuchel Says Chelsea "Scored 5 Goals" In 4-2 Loss To Arsenal Before Blaming The PitchThomas Tuchel was critical of his team's defending and the Stamford Bridge pitch after Wednesday's 4-2 loss to Arsenal.
Tuchel told Sky Sports after the game: "We scored five goals and lost 4-2.
"Three own goals, two regular goals for us and one for Arsenal.
"We don't get these goals, we give these goals away here in consecutive games, you cannot win Premier League matches like that."
"The ball bounces very awkwardly in front of Andreas when he runs to play the ball.

     Summary: By Simon EvansMANCHESTER, England (Reuters) – Manchester City regained their one-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a 3-0 win over Brighton and Hove Albion while Arsenal upset London rivals Chelsea with a 4-2 victory at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.
Kevin De Bruyne burst forward from inside his own half, brushing off three challengers, before finding Mahrez who converted at the second attempt.
Bernardo Silva added a late third to round off the win that moved Pep Guardiola’s side onto 77 points from 32 games.
PEGGED BACKBut the visitors were quickly pegged back on both occasions by equalisers from Timo Werner and Cesar Azpilicueta.
Chelsea stayed in third place on 62 points having played a game less than both Spurs and Arsenal.

     Summary: Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has claimed the Stamford Bridge pitch was partially to blame for Wednesday's 4-2 defeat to Arsenal.
"To say the pitch is difficult to play here it maybe sounds like an excuse, but it is a very, very difficult pitch that we have here.
A defensive performance is a team performance, and an offensive performance is a team performance.
You need to have the tactics right, which is doubtful I had this right, and you need the team selection right, again it's doubtful I had this right.
I don't see it in any other matches, but I see it now in consecutive matches of our games, and it has to stop."

Dear old Arsenal, wobbly Arsenal, fragile Arsenal, banterous Arsenal, the big six side voted most likely to tie together their own shoelaces together… they came out and they won the thing?
But what a strange season Chelsea have had, even without the whole seized-by-the-state thing.
Over in the game that nobody was watching, Manchester City kept everybody waiting just long enough.
Last night Manchester City weren't actually playing against Brighton, for Brighton — a perfectly reasonable football team — are not good enough to stop Manchester City.
