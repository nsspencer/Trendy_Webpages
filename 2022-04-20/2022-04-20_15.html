     Moon Knight Episode 4 Ending Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With that in mind, the Lemire and Smallwood run can provide some answers to what is surely the most confusing MCU episode since WandaVision.
One of Lemire and Smallwood’s most important contributions to Moon Knight canon is reframing his mental illness.
When most creative teams would address Marc’s mental state, they would describe it as broken, as if there was a coherent whole that Marc needed to achieve.
But in Lemire and Smallwood’s run, Marc discovers that his different way of approaching the world was itself a gift, a type of special ability.
However, if the show adheres to the Lemire and Smallwood run, then something quite different is happening.

     Summary: Now, Moon Knight has—and forever will have—Hippo God.
Before we get to Hippo God, who, yes, has a name, let's briefly discuss the surreal ending to Episode 4 of Moon Knight.
At the end of this week's edition, villain Arthur Harrow shoots and kills Marc Spector, which kills Steven Grant as well.
Well, as far as the Hippo God of it all goes, this character is the Egyptian deity Taweret.
Here's what Moon Knight Head Writer/Executive Producer told Marvel.com about the decision to include Taweret:“Right from the very first week, Marvel provided us with a ton of reference material on Egyptology, and on ancient Egyptian gods and deities,” He continues.

     Summary: This story contains spoilers for “Moon Knight” Episode 4.
The fourth episode of “Moon Knight” makes you question everything you thought you knew about the show.
Television ‘Moon Knight,’ explained: An episode-by-episode guide From characters’ comic book backstories to the Marvel series’ pantheon of Egyptian gods, keep our guide handy as you watch “Moon Knight” on Disney+.
“There’s one particular run of ‘Moon Knight’ by [Greg] Smallwood and [Jeff] Lemire that has this mind-bending, reality-questioning imagery that we based a lot of our own approach on,” explained Moorhead.
The 2016 “Moon Knight” comic book run, for example, introduced a sci-fi space pilot version of Marc Spector as a new identity.

What good is a Moon Knight who’s no longer a knight powered by the moon?
We’re now two thirds of the way into Moon Knight, and the show’s strengths are self-evident.
No, there’s no cool superheroic death-defying Moon Knight action in this ep, and Khonshu is out of the picture as well.
Is Moon Knight going to reinvent the genre?
