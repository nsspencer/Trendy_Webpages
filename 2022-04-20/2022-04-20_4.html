     Deebo Samuel Reportedly Doesn’t Want to Be Dual Receiver, Rusher
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Deebo Samuel requested a trade from the 49ers, reported on Wednesday by ESPN’s Jeff Darlington, it wasn’t clear at first why the wide receiver wanted to leave San Francisco.
“It sounds like there’s multiple layers to this, but certainly one of them is Deebo Samuel wants to be a receiver and not a receiver/running back,” Pelissero said on The Rich Eisen Show.
With these statistics, Samuel led the 49ers in receiving yards, and he also had the second most rushing yards behind Elijah Mitchell.
It appears that Samuel wants to go to a team that doesn’t have running back or wide receiver issues, a team where he can solely play the role of wide receiver.
“In the big picture, it sounds like the role is part of the reason that Deebo wants to play somewhere else,” Pelissero said.

     The Atlanta Falcons must pursue dynamic WR Deebo Samuel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dec 19, 2021; Santa Clara, California, USA; San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel (19) runs with the football during the second quarter against the Atlanta Falcons at Levi's Stadium.
The draft involves a lot of luck, however, Atlanta could instead trade for a proven player that has requested a trade from his current team.
Deebo Samuel is a player the Atlanta Falcons need to pursueDeebo Samuel could fix the Falcons’ wide receiver room all by himself, he is a special talent that seems to be on the trade market now.
From NFL Now: For more than a week, the #49ers have been dealing with a major issue in their WRs room, as Deebo Samuel requested a trade.
Think about what he would bring to the Falcons, a player who can line up anywhere and will physically dominate the opposition after the catch.

     49ers News: Who gets the most blame for the Deebo Samuel situation?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Depending on who, or what, you believe, things between the 49ers and Deebo Samuel have soured because of money or not because of money.
In my opinion, it’s hard not to put most of the blame on the 49ers’ brain trust.
If you’re the seller, Deebo Samuel, you demand an outrageous price hoping that you’ll get it but ultimately being willing to settle for something lower to make a deal.
Team Deebo could have let the 49ers know this offseason that Samuel was willing to do what was necessary during the year last year to help the team win, but that was not going to be the case going forward.
On the flip side, it’s also entirely possible that Team Deebo could be demanding $30 million per year and refusing to move off of that number.

I put together a graphic of every NFL team that should try to trade for Deebo Samuel.
Compare what New England can offer to recent wide receiver swaps, though, and it’s obvious they could finish a deal if they wanted to.

     Summary: Deebo Samuel's transformation into an explosive hybrid weapon in San Francisco could prove to be short-lived.
Samuel has requested a trade from the 49ers, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday.
Unlike other receivers who have created drama this offseason, Samuel's issue with the 49ers is not related to money.
Shanahan deployed Samuel as both a receiver and a versatile backfield weapon, handing him the ball as a running back and confusing defenses.
From Weeks 10-18, Samuel saw an average of 6.6 carries per game, gaining 42.9 rushing yards per contest while scoring seven rushing touchdowns.

     Star receiver Deebo Samuel asks San Francisco 49ers to trade him

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- For the past few months, the San Francisco 49ers have repeatedly said they'd like to keep wide receiver Deebo Samuel for a long time.
Samuel, who is entering the final year of his rookie contract, told ESPN's Jeff Darlington that he has asked the 49ers to trade him.
"Like I've long said, those guys are going to be a part of us for a long, long time," Lynch said.
Aside from Samuel, the Niners' current receiver group consists of Brandon Aiyuk, Jauan Jennings, Ray-Ray McCloud, Malik Turner and Marcus Johnson.
In three seasons with the Niners, Samuel has 167 receptions for 2,598 yards and 10 touchdowns with 550 rushing yards and 11 scores on the ground.
