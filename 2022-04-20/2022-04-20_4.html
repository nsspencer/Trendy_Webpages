In announcing his retirement Wednesday after 21 seasons at Villanova, Wright, 60, leaves men’s college basketball at a relatively young age and at the top of his profession.
A head coach since 1994, Wright compiled a record of 642-282 (.695) during his career at Hofstra and Villanova, where he had coached since 2001.
Kyle Neptune, 37, will succeed Wright at Villanova, the university announced.
Fordham named the associate head coach Keith Urgo as the interim head coach and said it would conduct a national search for Neptune’s replacement.

     Villanova Coach Jay Wright Announces Retirement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Villanova men’s basketball coach Jay Wright is retiring, he announced Wednesday night.
“It’s time for us to enter a new era of Villanova basketball,” Wright wrote in a statement.
In his 21-year tenure at Villanova, Wright won 520 games, went to four Final Fours and won national championships in 2016 and ’18.
Once known as one of the top coaches in the sport without a national title, Wright finally topped that mountain with a buzzer-beating victory over North Carolina in 2016.
Neptune, 37, spent eight years under Wright as an assistant coach, including for both national championships.

     Villanova coach Jay Wright steps down, joining growing number who are walking away from a changing profession
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is a man who is only 60 years old in a sport where coaches often work into their 70s.
Wright offered no real explanation in his announcement on Twitter -- but he did say he's 'excited to hand over the reigns to Villanova's next coach."
The one thing every former college basketball coach who becomes an NBA coach says he loves is how it allows him to A) get back to just coaching basketball without all "the other stuff," and B) enjoy an offseason in some form.
Right now, college basketball coaches are constantly dealing with "the other stuff" with no real window to comfortably take even a one-week vacation.
On some level, it's impossible to not think that's what Jay Wright just did.
