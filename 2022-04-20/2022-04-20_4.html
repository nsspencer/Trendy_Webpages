     Milwaukee Bucks lose forward Bobby Portis in first quarter of Game 2 with right eye abrasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MILWAUKEE -- Bucks forward Bobby Portis exited in the first quarter Wednesday against the Chicago Bulls and did not return.
No foul was called on the play, but Portis fell to the ground after contact and was bleeding near his right eye after the play.
Shortly after the third quarter began, the Bucks ruled him out for the rest of the game with a right eye abrasion.
According to Budenholzer, the latest injury stems from something that happened in the Bucks' April 8 game at Detroit.
Jevon Carter filled Hill's spot in the rotation the Bucks' 93-86 Game 1 victory and scored three points in 10 minutes.

     Summary: (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Chicago Bulls in a hard-fought Game 1 on Sunday, and among the most notable takeaways was the defensive effort against DeMar DeRozan.
Keeping the forward off the line will be a pivotal aspect throughout this series as the Bucks look to contain DeRozan.
The Milwaukee Bucks must continue defending DeMar DeRozan without foulingDeRozan proved to be one of the best in the business at getting to the free throw line during the regular season as he earned 593 attempts, the third-most in the association, per NBA.com/stats.
The free throw line is a prominent aspect of DeRozan’s game, and limiting his appearances there will be vital throughout this series.
Time will tell if the Milwaukee Bucks can replicate their Game 1 excellence on DeRozan.
