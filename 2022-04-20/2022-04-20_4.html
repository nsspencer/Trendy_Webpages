     What Is 420? Here's Why April 20 Is Associated With Marijuana
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While several different explanations have been given, a definitive reason of why 420 is associated with marijuana has yet to be determined.
The then-high school students are said to have smoked marijuana every day at 4:20 p.m. and the number 420 became code for smoking the plant, with 4/20 being acknowledged for calendar purposes.
A far less popular theory traces the 420 origin to the 1939 short story In the Walls of Eryx by H.P.
Lovecraft and Kenneth Sterling, which describes "curious mirage-plants" that seem to resemble marijuana as getting the narrator high at 4:20, according to his watch, which would serve as the possible earliest documented link of marijuana to 420.
As of April 20, 2022, recreational marijuana is legal in 18 states and Washington, D.C., while medicinal marijuana is only illegal in 11 states.

The high schoolers, engaging in an activity that was strictly illegal at the time, started to use “420” as code for marijuana, Time reported.
A 2009 article in the New York Times corroborates the history of 420 reported in Time.
Support for legalizing marijuana for medicinal use, and even recreational use, has been growing in the last several years.
A poll released by Elon University last year showed that 54% of North Carolinians backed legalizing marijuana completely, and 73% supported legalizing medical marijuana.

     Summary: There have been many theories, such as 4/20 being the signal code police use when responding to a call involving people smoking marijuana or that there are 420 cannabinoids produced in the cannabis plant.
Phillip Reagan, a cashier at the store, said the men would gather at 4:20 p.m. every day after school to smoke marijuana and would use the term “4-20” to remind one another of the meeting.
They would indeed meet at a statue on campus every day and later revealed to a reporter at TIME that they were the “inventors” of 4/20.
The band and those associated used the term when referring to activities involving marijuana, helping to popularize it even more.
As of April 2022, 18 states have legalized the recreational use of marijuana.

     Summary: The city promoted the event on social media but quickly took the post down after pushback.
The city put up a cringeworthy post on Twitter and Facebook on April 19 in what appeared to be someone trying to sound hip.
After a greeting of “Sup Denverites?,” the post goes on to promote the Mile High 420 Fest happening at Civic Center Park on 4/20.
So much controversy was generated that the city took the unusual step of removing this post, saying they generally do not promote events not sponsored by the city.
