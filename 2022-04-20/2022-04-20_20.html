     Rudy Giuliani Was Finally Unmasked on The Masked Singer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch : Ken Jeong Talks Competing on "The Masked Singer" in KoreaWe've seen drama on The Masked Singer—but never anything like this.
Following a performance of "Bad to the Bone" by George Thorogood &amp; The Destroyers, mysterious celebrity singer Jack in the Box was revealed to be Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and personal attorney to President Donald Trump.
The presence of Giuliani, who was put under federal investigation for violating lobbying laws in 2019 and had his New York law license suspended in 2021, did not sit well with panelist Ken Jeong.
After Jack in the Box's headpiece was removed, panelist Nicole Scherzinger asked Jeong, "Is that Robert Duvall?"
Jeong then stood with his arms crossed and was completely silent while the rest of the panel and host Nick Cannon chatted with Giuliani.

“This is definitely something I never would have guessed,” added judge Robin Thicke.
Fellow judge Nicole Scherzinger looked confused and asked Jeong, “Is that Robert Duvall?” a reference to Thicke’s earlier guess.
McCarthy thanked Giuliani for appearing – apparently doing the show for his granddaughter – and said she was “so glad” he appeared.

     Rudy Giuliani’s ‘Masked Singer’ Turn Is the Show’s Worst Decision Yet (Column)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Perhaps the only gratifying thing about Rudy Giuliani’s appearance on “The Masked Singer” is that the element of surprise the show’s producers craved was ruined in advance.
Wednesday night’s episode of “The Masked Singer” saw former New York City mayor and lawyer for former President Donald Trump revealed as the Jack in the Box.
The mood seemed dour post-reveal, with Jeong outright glowering and crossing his arms, and eventually walking off during Giuliani’s reprise performance.
“It surprises us all that you’re here on ‘The Masked Singer,'” the usually ebullient host Nick Cannon said flatly.
But “The Masked Singer” isn’t drafting off of his status as an admired citizen, any more than it booked Palin because of what she accomplished in office as the governor of Alaska.
