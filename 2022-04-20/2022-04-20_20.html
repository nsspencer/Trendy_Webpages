     Tennis great Pam Shriver: I had ‘damaging’ relationship with coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON — Former professional tennis player Pam Shriver, now a television commentator for ESPN and the BBC, says that she “had an inappropriate and damaging relationship with my much older coach” that began when she was 17 and he was 50.
In a first-person account published Wednesday by British newspaper The Telegraph, Shriver describes a “painful and emotional journey” that included what she writes was a relationship with coach Don Candy that lasted a little more than five years.
She beat Martina Navratilova in the semifinals before losing the title match to Chris Evert.
Shriver, who is from Maryland, would later team with Navratilova to win 21 Grand Slam trophies in women’s doubles.
In Wednesday’s piece, Shriver writes her “main motivation is to let people know this still goes on — a lot.

     Summary: “My particular expertise, though, is in tennis, where I have witnessed dozens of instances in my four-and-a-bit decades as a player and commentator.
Though the relationship became inappropriate about two years into her career, Shriver revealed it did not become sexual until she was 20.
“And because I was, you know, living the life of trying to be the best tennis player I could be, I really didn’t understand how difficult the secret and the juggling was.
The tennis star described the relationship as “traumatic,” adding that it “shaped my whole experience of romantic life.
The health and safety of all WTA Tour stakeholders—including the players—is our priority, and our commitment to safeguarding remains resolute.”

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 22-time grand slam doubles champion Pam Shriver says she had an “inappropriate and damaging relationship” with her coach which started when she was a teenager, and has warned that similar scenarios are commonplace in tennis.
When she was 17 she told the 50-year-old Candy she was falling in love with him and they went on to have an affair.
The relationship ended when she sought out a new coach, although she continued to keep in touch with Candy as a consultant.
By the time they graduate to the main tennis tour, many patterns have already been set,” she says.
The best way to protect their charges is to put them through an education process before they arrive on tour.
