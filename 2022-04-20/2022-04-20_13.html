    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I hope we win,” Cabrera said.
Cabrera, 2-for-11 for his career off Yankees starter Luis Severino entering the night, matched his hit total in two at-bats.
Cabrera’s first hit was a second-inning slow roller to the left side that left third baseman DJ LeMahieu with no play.
The 59.2 mph dribbler off Severino had an expected batting average of .080, tied for the ninth lowest on a Cabrera hit since Statcast began tracking in 2015.
On Victor Reyes’ ensuing RBI single to right, Cabrera tried to take right fielder Giancarlo Stantion by surprise, but was thrown out at third base.
