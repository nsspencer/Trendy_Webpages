When she boards the subway, though, she sees posters for Cats and Sophie’s Choice.
Back in 1982, Nadia gets to Chez’s and looks inside the leather bag, finding a stash of gold Krugerrands.

     Review: I was wrong about 'Russian Doll.' Here's why you should watch Season 2.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I have to admit, I was wrong about "Russian Doll."
And like any mature adult (Nadia at the end of Season 1, rather than the beginning), I can admit when I'm wrong.
After revisiting (and loving) the first season, I worried the second season (now streaming, ★★★½ out of four) might not live up to what felt like a complete, full-circle story.
"Doll" didn't really need to come back, but Lyonne and the writers found a way to advance the story without ruining it.
Trying to recapture old glory is often a fool's errand, especially in Hollywood where sequels, remakes and remakes of remakes wring every good idea dry.

As viewers watch Russian Doll season 2, they might notice a familiar name in the credits.
Comedian Rosie O'Donnell is credited throughout the second season as a guest star, but she never actually appears on screen.
We were sort of running down the line, we're like, 'Rosie Perez, Rosie… Mike Rappaport.

     ‘Russian Doll’ Cast on Working With Natasha Lyonne and Season 2’s Big Swings
    </h2>

     Summary: Netflix’s Russian Doll isn’t just a job for the cast and crew.
Nadia, Natasha’s character, goes inside and keeps discovering that layer,” Poehler told THR.
“We talked about the theme of the show as trying to figure out: What is your little core Russian doll?
And, how did we end up this way?” Russian Doll star Greta Lee told THR.
“Something utterly mundane suddenly feels like, ‘Is it worth risking my life for?’ We’re all going through this kind of new world together.”Just like Russian Doll.

     ‘Russian Doll’ didn’t need a second season, but the series pulls it off beautifully
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Given how firmly it closed its circular plot, and the relatively peculiar particulars of its narrative — “relatively” since it ran on an engine oft-lifted from “Groundhog Day” — it’s somewhat surprising to see a second season of “Russian Doll,” the excellence of its 2019 first season notwithstanding.

AdvertisementCharlie Barnett in “Russian Doll” Season 2.
“Russian Doll” turns somersaults to get where it’s going, but its conclusions are emotionally unambiguous and universally useful and consonant with the previous season’s themes of attachment and surrender.
And if its sentimental streak is leavened with skepticism, sentiment is what makes “Russian Doll” valuable and skepticism what keeps the sentiment bearable.

     Russian Doll Recap: Derailed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With “Exquisite Corpse,” Russian Doll makes its biggest journey yet — to Budapest in 1944, not long before the Soviet army invaded the city.
Nadia boarded a 6 train intending to go to 1982, probably planning to pry open some floorboards at Vera’s apartment.
I’ve been trying to figure out the broad strokes of how time travel works in Russian Doll.
While he consciously chose to board that train, he didn’t know where (or when or to whom) he was going.
• Russian Doll has always been built around Natasha Lyonne’s exceptional performance, but there’s greater variation in “Exquisite Corpse.” She inhabits multiple roles and times, capturing Nadia’s emotional highs and lows with aplomb.

Forget the past four years — we don’t know much about Alan, period.
But by glossing over Alan’s past (and his present, when he’s not visiting the past), Russian Doll leaves the audience without the same “silver thread that tethers” us to Alan’s reality,” as “Hungarian god” Kristof might put it, that Nadia’s story has.
Though she’s not on the six train to the past, Nadia still plans some space-time hijinks.
