     Ohio Doctor Is Acquitted of Killing Patients With Fentanyl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An Ohio doctor who had been accused of killing 14 patients with overdoses of fentanyl from 2014 to 2018 was acquitted on Wednesday by a county jury, bringing an end to one of the state’s largest murder cases, which set off a debate about end-of-life medical care.
The doctor, William Husel, 46, had been admired by his colleagues and patients at the Mount Carmel Health System, which is based in Columbus, after he started working there in 2013.
In 2018, two hospital pharmacists reported their concerns that Dr. Husel had been prescribing unusually high doses of fentanyl.
When he treated patients, who were often gravely ill, he sometimes offered them “comfort medication,” which turned out to be fentanyl.
One patient received a dosage 20 times higher than the amount recommended by the Food and Drug Administration, Franklin County prosecutors said.

     William Husel, Ohio doctor accused in 14 high-dose fentanyl deaths, acquitted of murder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: William Husel stands during a short break in his trial on Tuesday., Feb. 22, 2022 at the Franklin County Common Pleas Courthouse in Columbus, Ohio.
An Ohio doctor was acquitted Wednesday of hastening the deaths of multiple critically ill patients by ordering large doses of the powerful painkiller fentanyl.
William Husel faced 14 counts of murder — one for each patient.
Husel, whose medical license was suspended in January 2019, faced life in prison with no chance of parole for 15 years if he were found guilty of even one count of murder.
Franklin County prosecutors called more than 50 witnesses, including medical experts, family members of the patients who died and Husel's former colleagues.

     Ohio doctor accused of overprescribing fentanyl to the dying found not guilty of murder

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Ohio doctor accused of overprescribing fentanyl to his critically ill patients and hastening their deaths was found not guilty of 14 counts of murder on Wednesday.
William Husel and his attorney embraced at the defense table after the 14th and final not guilty verdict was read in court.
William Husel was accused of overprescribing fentanyl to dying patients in the intensive care unit from 2015 to 2018.
After the verdict, Franklin County Ohio prosecutor Gary Tyack praised both sides of the case.
"The State of Ohio v. William Husel was carefully tried and prepared by both the Prosecution and the Defense," he said.

     Ohio doctor accused of giving fatal doses of fentanyl to patients found not guilty of murder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An Ohio doctor accused by prosecutors of hastening the deaths of numerous intensive care patients by prescribing excessive doses of painkillers was found not guilty on 14 counts of murder Wednesday.
All 14 patients died within 30 minutes of Husel administering them fentanyl doses ranging from 500 to 2,000 micrograms.
One expert witness said doses of up to 2,000 micrograms of fentanyl ordered by Husel for some patients were enough to kill an elephant.
By contrast, defense lawyers called a single witness — a Georgia anesthesiologist — to testify that Husel’s patients died from their medical conditions, not the doctor’s actions.
Husel still faces more than 10 active civil lawsuits from the families of patients who died while under his care.

     Doctor accused of killing 14 patients with fentanyl acquitted of murder

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Husel, a onetime physician of the year trained at the Cleveland Clinic, faced one count of murder for each of the 14 critically ill patients he was accused of killing.
Husel and Baez argued in the trial that the doctor offered comfort care for dying patients and was not trying to kill them.
He ordered 1,000 micrograms of fentanyl for multiple patients — about 10 times the recommended dosage, according to prosecutors.
After all 14 counts came back as not guilty, Husel wiped away tears.
Even with his acquittal in the murder trial, Husel still faces more than 10 lawsuits from the families of patients.
