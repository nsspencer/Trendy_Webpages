     ‘Red Table Talk’ Sidesteps Oscars Slap, Jada Pinkett Smith Promises to Discuss on Show ‘When the Time Calls’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jada Pinkett Smith’s talk show, “Red Table Talk,” returned on Wednesday, and though there was a brief message for viewers alluding to the topic on everyone’s mind, the series sidestepped the elephant in the room: Will Smith’s Oscars slap.
The episode began with a silent black screen and an introductory message, signed from Pinkett Smith, who thanked viewers for joining.
“Red Table Talk” on Facebook Watch is hosted by Pinkett Smith, her daughter Willow Smith and her mother Adrienne Banfield Norris.
Pinkett Smith has been open about her struggle with hair loss due to alopecia.
Many have suspected he will eventually sit down down for a larger television interview, and some have questioned if he would break his silence on “Red Table Talk,” with Oprah or elsewhere.

     How Jada Pinkett Smith and ‘Red Table Talk’ handled Will Smith’s Oscars slap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The discourse around Will Smith’s Oscars slap has finally come full circle to “Red Table Talk,” where Jada Pinkett Smith vaguely addressed the incident and fallout publicly Wednesday for the first time.
At the 2022 Oscars, Smith walked onto the stage and smacked Rock after the presenter made a joke about Pinkett Smith’s bald hairstyle.
In a 2018 episode of “Red Table Talk,” Pinkett Smith opened up about her struggles with hair loss — a “terrifying” phenomenon that initially made her physically shake with fear.
Taking care of my hair has been a beautiful ritual,” Pinkett Smith said in 2018.
In a “Red Table Talk” first, all three of Smith’s children — Willow, Jaden and Trey — will take over as hosts of the program for a special episode set to premiere during Season 5.
