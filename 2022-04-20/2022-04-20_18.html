     Summary: PSG Were 15 Minutes From Winning Ligue 1 But Their Wait Should Officially End On SaturdayParis Saint-Germain came close to being officially crowned as champions of France on Wednesday.
They still needed to score again to delay PSG's coronation and Amine Harit duly delivered with 15 minutes to go.
At the end of the night, PSG sat 15 points ahead of Marseille with a significantly superior goal difference.
It is a matter of when and not if PSG will clinch their 10th Ligue 1 title.
PSG need only to avoid defeat against the team in seventh place to win back the title they lost to Lille last season.

     PSG on verge of record-equaling 10th title, Marseille wins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PSG is 15 points ahead of second-place Marseille and has a vastly superior goal difference, but still still needs one point at home against Lens on Saturday to clinch the title.
PSG is set to move level with Saint-Etienne, which won its 10th title in 1981 and is fighting to stay up this season.
Kylian Mbappe fired PSG ahead from the edge of the penalty area in the 28th minute after swapping passes with right back Achraf Hakimi.
It looked like PSG would be able to start celebrating the title as Nantes led twice at Marseille.
Payet’s second penalty in the 55th made it 12 league goals for the former France playmaker, seven of them from the spot.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kylian Mbappe put PSG in front as Ligue 1's leading scorer notched his 22nd of the season just before the half-hour mark at the Stade Raymond Kopa.
OM came from behind twice against Nantes through Dimitri Payet penalties before Harit struck in the 75th minute to make it 3-2 and secure a precious win for Jorge Sampaoli's side as they chase Champions League qualification.
PSG remain 15 points clear with just 15 points left to play for and also boast a far superior goal difference.
Meanwhile six-time champions Bordeaux remain in serious danger of being relegated to Ligue 2 after throwing away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at home to Saint-Etienne.
The result means Bordeaux are 19th, four points and one place behind Saint-Etienne who sit in the relegation play-off spot.
