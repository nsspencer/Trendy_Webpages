     Tesla Earnings Weren't Supposed to Be This Good. How It Managed a Surprise Beat.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wall Street was looking for earnings per share of about $2.20 to $2.30 from about $18 billion in sales.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, Tesla earned $2.54 a share on sales of $17.7 billion.
Sales of regulatory credits, which Tesla receives because it produces more than its fair share of low-emission vehicles, contributed to the surprise.
Even excluding credit sales, operating profit was a record and much better than Wall Street expected.
But Tesla’s cost per car dropped compared with the fourth quarter.

     Summary: Tesla Inc. late Wednesday reported another record quarter of sales and profit, blowing past Wall Street estimates even though it said its factories continue to run below capacity due to supply-chain problems.
Analysts polled by FactSet expected the company to report adjusted earnings of $2.26 a share on sales of $17.85 billion.

Tesla said in the letter that supply-chain problems and raw-material prices costs that recently have increased “multiple-fold” continue to weigh.
The ramp up in the newer factories also will depend on the supply-chain snags, Tesla said.
