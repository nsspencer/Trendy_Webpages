     Yankees' Gerrit Cole records shortest start of MLB career vs. Tigers as early season struggles continue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Yankees ace Gerrit Cole tied his career-high in walks in the shortest start of his career on Tuesday night against the Detroit Tigers.
Cole walked five of the 11 batters he faced and he surrendered two runs (both earned) on 68 pitches before being removed with two outs in the second inning.
Cole, 31 years old, faced four batters in the first inning, striking out three of them and walking the other.
Cole had walked five batters on just one other prior occasion: June 18, 2018 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
Cole is projected to take his next start on Sunday at home against the Cleveland Guardians.

     'Disappointing': Gerrit Cole Evaluates Shortest Start of Career
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cole lasted just 1.2 innings on a chilly night in Detroit, tying his career high with five walks.
Hours earlier, the Yankees ace was yanked after just 1.2 innings pitched, the shortest start of his big-league career.
After striking out the side in the first, Cole completely lost control of the strike zone in the second.
After an abbreviated spring, Cole had yet to throw more than 85 pitches in a game this season.
"Certainly never had an inning like that in my career before," Cole said.

     Yankees ace Gerrit Cole reflects on rough season start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Still, the performance from Cole is deeply troubling for the Bronx Bombers, as they came into the year hoping to rely on the 31-year-old to be their go-to pitcher going forward.
When asked what was going through his mind as Boone exited the dugout to pull him out of the game, Cole put his feelings bluntly.
Still, the manager said he wasn’t overly worried about Cole going forward.
I know he’s going to carry us,” he said.
His second start against the Blue Jays was similarly rough, as he threw 5.2 innings, and again earned 3 runs.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Yankees starting pitcher Gerrit Cole had a rough outing on Tuesday night against the Detroit Tigers.
The Yankees won the game, though it was no thanks to Cole, who endured the shortest outing of his career, as he was pulled in the second inning by manager Aaron Boone.
Visibly disappointed on the mound and after the game, Cole delivered a blunt reaction to Boone’s quick hook, as reported by the New York Post.
Yankees fans wanted to scream expletives too, as they made it known how they felt about Cole’s outing, even in the Tigers’ home ballpark.
If Cole doesn’t turn things around soon, he’ll feel like screaming expletives and four-letter words far more often.

     Summary: DETROIT — As Aaron Boone went to the mound to take out Gerrit Cole in the second inning, the Yankees ace pounded his hand into his glove five times.
“But it’s not something we can’t get through.”Aaron Boone takes out Gerrit Cole in the second inning of the Yankees’ 4-2 win over the Tigers.
“I probably shouldn’t have left him out there as long as I did, with the weather and number of pitches,’’ Boone said.
“He had two out, and I just wanted him to get through it.”Despite the early results, Boone still has confidence in the right-hander.
Gerrit Cole gets pulled from Yankees win over the Tigers on April 19, 2022.
