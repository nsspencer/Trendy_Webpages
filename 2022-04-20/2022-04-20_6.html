     Sonic Origins launches in June with remasters of four classic games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ), Sega has finally revealed the details behind Sonic Origins, a remastered collection of Sonic The Hedgehog 1, 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD.
In Sonic Origins, players will be able to choose between playing in classic mode or anniversary mode.
While Sega has given fans umpteen bundles of the first three Sonic games, Sonic CD hasn’t seen a proper re-release since 2011.
While it’ll likely be some time yet before we see gameplay for Sonic Frontiers, Sonic Origins is perfectly suited to occupy fans until then.
Sonic Origins launches on Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and PC on June 23rd.

     Sega Remasters The First Four Sonic Games For Sonic Origins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wasting no time capitalizing on its second smash-hit live-action video game adaptation, Sega reaches its pristine, puffy white gloves into its content bucket, pulling out Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 (&amp; Knuckles), and Sonic CD and bundling them all together as Sonic Origins, a $40 “remastered” package launching June 23 across all consoles.
For those seeking greater challenges, Origins includes new, optional missions in each game.
The best thing about the Sonic Origins reveal is the lovely animated trailer.
Using the same frenetic style introduced when Sonic Mania was first released, the animation captures the spirit of the series as perfectly as possible.
Just keep an eye out for Sonic Origins’ somewhat tricky purchase plan.

     Sega’s Sonic Origins retro collection coming this June
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sega’s Sonic Origins collection will bring Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD to current gaming platforms on June 23, the publisher announced Wednesday.
Sonic Origins will be released digitally for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and will cost $39.99.
Sega announced Sonic Origins last May, during Sega’s Sonic Central livestream.
Sonic 3 was not included as part of the Sega Genesis Mini library (though Sonic Spinball was), nor was it given the Sega Ages treatment for Nintendo Switch, the way Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 were.
Sonic fans have speculated, without confirmation from Sega, that Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles’ rerelease is complicated by thorny music rights.

     Summary: Sega has since confirmed the various launch editions of Sonic Origins, revealing a variety of unforeseen pre-order content, DLC, and further monetization.
To start, Sonic Origins will be launching in two different editions, a standard edition and the Digital Deluxe Edition.
RELATED: New Sonic Origins Collection Containing Classic Games Releasing Next YearSega will also be offering two DLC packs for Sonic Origins, currently listed as "Coming Soon."
The pre-order DLC for Sonic Origins is a particular point of contention for fans, however.
The Start Dash Pack, available solely by pre-ordering either edition of Sonic Origins, is the only way to acquire Mirror Mode for Sonic Origins.
