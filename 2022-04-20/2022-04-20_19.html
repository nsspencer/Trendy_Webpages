     Rudy Giuliani unmasked on 'The Masked Singer'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A previous version of this story first published in February.
(CNN) Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and former attorney to ex-President Donald Trump, was unmasked on Wednesday's episode of Fox's "The Masked Singer."
Back in February, it was reported that two judges had walked off during the taping of the episode after Giuliani was unmasked.
The drama in the episode that aired was far more subdued.
After Giuliani was revealed as the person inside the Jack in the Box costume, judge Robin Thicke said, "This is definitely something I never would have guessed."

     ‘Masked Singer’ Reveals Rudy Giuliani as Judge Ken Jeong Storms Off Stage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Controversy hit The Masked Singer as Rudy Giuliani was revealed as the Jack in the Box on Wednesday in the Fox singing competition’s latest contestant departure, and one judge in particular was clearly displeased.
Giuliani’s unmasking had been long-awaited, as the filming of his exit episode made headlines back in February.
For his final song, the former New York City Mayor and member of former President Donald Trump’s legal team performed “Bad to the Bone” while unmasked.
After Giuliani started to sing his goodbye performance, Jeong could be heard saying, “I’m done,” and then walked off the set.
And the Masked Singer producers and Fox felt they wanted to be a part of the laundering process for him.”Four celebrities remain on the seventh season of Fox’s The Masked Singer.

     ‘Masked Singer’ judge walks off after Rudy Giuliani revealed as contestant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rudy Giuliani’s presence alone stirred up primetime drama during Wednesday night’s episode of “The Masked Singer” as judge Ken Jeong stormed off stage when the former mayor was unveiled as the secret contestant dressed as a giant rooster.
On Wednesday night’s episode, Rudy Giuliani popped out of a jack in the box while singing a rendition of “Bad to the Bone.”The cringe-worthy performance was taped months ago.
“I can’t think of anything more unlike me and unlikely than this,” Giuliani said of the show.
“It can’t get badder than that,” judge Robin Thicke quipped about the jarring rendition.
Scherzinger and fellow judge Jenny McCarthy enthusiastically applauded Giuliani and danced to his version of “Bone” as the credits rolled.

     ‘The Masked Singer’ Finally Unveils Rudy Giuliani: “Is That Robert Duvall?”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rudy Giuliani was finally unmasked on The Masked Singer.
“This is definitely something I never would have guessed,” added judge Robin Thicke.
Fellow judge Nicole Scherzinger looked confused and asked Jeong, “Is that Robert Duvall?” a reference to Thicke’s earlier guess.
McCarthy thanked Giuliani for appearing – apparently doing the show for his granddaughter – and said she was “so glad” he appeared.
The Masked Singer, whose season is titled “The Good, The Bad and the Cuddly,” is produced by Fox Alternative Entertainment with former BBC exec Moira Ross as showrunner.

     Rudy Giuliani’s ‘Masked Singer’ Turn Is the Show’s Worst Decision Yet (Column)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Perhaps the only gratifying thing about Rudy Giuliani’s appearance on “The Masked Singer” is that the element of surprise the show’s producers craved was ruined in advance.
Wednesday night’s episode of “The Masked Singer” saw former New York City mayor and lawyer for former President Donald Trump revealed as the Jack in the Box.
The mood seemed dour post-reveal, with Jeong outright glowering and crossing his arms, and eventually walking off during Giuliani’s reprise performance.
“It surprises us all that you’re here on ‘The Masked Singer,'” the usually ebullient host Nick Cannon said flatly.
But “The Masked Singer” isn’t drafting off of his status as an admired citizen, any more than it booked Palin because of what she accomplished in office as the governor of Alaska.
