     Lakers news: Russell Westbrook injury delivers another blow to LA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It looks like Russell Westbrook might join him on the injured list.
“I just got the report that he got foot soreness at halftime,” said Lakers head coach Darvin Ham on Russell Westbrook’s exit with injury.
“As a staff, we just decided to shut him down.”Russell Westbrook’s injury, which the Lakers indicated as “left foot soreness”, has been lingering for quite some time.
He was also listed on the injury report a few more times for it but played through the pain.
Russell Westbrook was on a pretty decent run off the Lakers’ bench before aggravating his foot injury.

     Darvin Ham: Lakers Staff Decided To Shut Russell Westbrook Down At Halftime Against Hornets Due To Foot Soreness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unfortunately for the Lakers, Westbrook did not play in the second half of Monday night’s win over the Charlotte Hornets as he continues to deal with foot soreness that has caused him to miss a couple of games already this year.
Perhaps head coach Darvin Ham and the Lakers were being precautionary with Westbrook, knowing they can’t afford to lose him for any significant amount of time, especially right now.
More important, however, is the health of Westbrook moving forward as he has continued to flourish in his sixth-man role.
Henderson noted that he used to watch Westbrook highlights before games and that the passion that Westbrook continues to play with to this day is something he tries to bring out of himself.
