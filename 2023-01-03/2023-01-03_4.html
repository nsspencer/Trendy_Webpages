     Chicago Bulls falter late as Donovan Mitchell scores 71 to lead Cleveland Cavaliers to OT win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Bulls are going to have nightmares about Donovan Mitchell after his incredible performance on Monday night.
The scoring feat is the eighth-highest in the league and the most scored in a single game since the late great Kobe Bryant put up 81 points in 2006.
Every single point Mitchell scored was extremely crucial as Cleveland came all the way back from a 21-point deficit.
Bulls head coach Billy Donovan said he believes Mitchell committed a lane violation in that pivotal play.
Moreover, they have yet to win a single game in three tries against the Cavs, who happen to be their division rivals.
