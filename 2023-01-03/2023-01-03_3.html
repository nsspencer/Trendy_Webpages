     McCarthy fails on first speakership vote in historic loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep.-elect Mike Collins (R-Ga.), who had pledged to vote against McCarthy during his campaign, also backed him.
But in the meantime, the House GOP risks a chaotic floor fight, with no rules of the chamber yet in place.
“No one in this body has worked harder for this Republican majority than Kevin McCarthy,” New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the No.
3 House Republican, said in a booming floor speech delivered moments before lawmakers began to vote.
“If they think they can ask Kevin McCarthy to strong-arm the rest of us into going somewhere we don’t want to go, they are sorely mistaken.

     Why Kevin McCarthy Is So Bad at This
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Except for McCarthy, his proctored exam hall is the floor of the House of Representatives, and whether he passes will be determined by his classmates, most of whom may be cheering on his failure.
McCarthy, making his second bid to become the Speaker of the House, started his Tuesday undeniably short of the 218 aye votes he needs to claim the gavel and lead the lower chamber.
At least five of his fellow Republicans were in the Never Kevin camp, and another seven were Seldom Kevins.
But McCarthy still can’t secure unanimous support among the firebrands inside the Freedom Caucus.
Which brings us to this point: the House, before it can do anything else, has to elect a Speaker.

     Kevin McCarthy falls short in 1st vote for House speaker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: McCarthy emerged from a contentious closed-door meeting with fellow House Republicans unable to win over detractors and lacking the support needed to become speaker.
Outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had gaveled closed the last session moments earlier, moving aside for new Democratic leadership, to standing ovation from colleagues on her side of the aisle.
But first, House Republicans had to elect a speaker, second in succession to the presidency.
The morning meeting of House Republicans turned raucus ahead what’s traditionally a celebratory day as newly elected members arrive to be sworn into office.
“Kevin McCarthy is the right guy to lead this conference, the right guy to be speaker of the House,” Johnson said.

     Kevin McCarthy faces long battle after falling short in first House speaker vote
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, is facing a protracted battle to secure the speaker’s gavel after failing to win the first vote on Tuesday, the opening day of the new Congress.
On the first ballot to decide the next House speaker, 19 Republicans opposed McCarthy’s candidacy, leaving him 15 votes short of the 218 needed for a win.
In a demoralizing sign for the new House Republican majority, Democrat Hakeem Jeffries received more votes than McCarthy on the first ballot.
After the inconclusive first ballot, the House moved to a second vote – and possibly more – on Tuesday afternoon.
Following a contentious Republican conference meeting ahead of the midday speakership vote , McCarthy had promised that he would fight as long as necessary to win the top House position.
