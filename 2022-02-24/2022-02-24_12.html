     Stocks Crater Following Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine, Dow Futures Off 800 Points
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Global markets sold off sharply Thursday following Russia President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures down about 800 points in pre-market trading.
American markets followed those overseas, with Germany’s Dax off 4.8% and Asia’s Hang Seng index off by 3.2%.
“Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,” Biden said.
The U. S. and Europe have pledged to enact further sanctions against Russia and the leading supporters of Putin, following initial sanctions announced earlier in the week.
World energy markets were also roiled by the invasion, with the price of a barrel of oil topping $100.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The wide swings on Wall Street came as traders reacted to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The S&amp;P 500 reversed an initial drop to show a 1.5% gain by the close.
The late-day surge also pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average into positive territory, rebounding from an early 800-point loss to finish more than 100 points higher on the session.
The volatile session came amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which caused massive selling early in the day.
"Today's NASDAQ outperformance vs. S&amp;P 500 is helped by real yields falling, driven by the flight to safety," Cameron Dawson, chief market strategist at Fieldpoint Private, tweeted.

     Russian military vehicles breached the Kyiv region from Belarus to the north, Ukrainian officials said, after tanks reportedly rolled earlier into Ukraine from Crimea.
The government in Kyiv called it a “full-scale invasion” as it declared martial law and called for international support including harsher sanctions on Russia.
The flight to safety saw the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield tumble 10 basis points to under 1.9%.
The ruble reached a record low versus the greenback and the Bank of Russia said it will conduct foreign-exchange interventions.
