     UPDATE: 2 Santa Rosa Bartenders Arrested for Serving Underage Man Involved in December DUI Crash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SANTA ROSA (CBS SF) â€” The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) has arrested two Santa Rosa bartenders accused of serving an underage man who was later involved in a suspected DUI crash that injured a horseback rider last December.
A press release issued by Santa Rosa police confirmed the recent arrest of the two bartenders in connection with serving an underage individual at the Final Edition bar located in an unincorporated part of Sonoma County at 412 Larkfield Center near Santa Rosa on Dec. 12 of last year.
Santa Rosa police officers responded to the crash after receiving a report of a hit-and-run crash that resulted in major injuries to a man who was riding a horse.
The TRACE investigation by ABC agents identified 41-year-old Jason James Correia of Santa Rosa and 38-year-old Mandy McClish of Santa Rosa as the bartenders allegedly responsible for serving Hale at Final Edition the night of the suspected DUI crash.
The accusation could result in a suspension of the liquor license for Final Edition.
