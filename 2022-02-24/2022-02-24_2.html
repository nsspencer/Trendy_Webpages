     It was almost a unanimous vote for Miesha to take home the title and the prize.
In the end, bringing Todrick along with her to the final two proved to be both an honest and strategic move.
Not only did the jury love Miesha’s gameplay, but they hated Todrick’s!
Teddi even served the best burn of the night when she told Todrick that even though he loves Wizard of Oz, he forgot that the jury “can see behind the curtain.”

Todrick Hall canceled interviews about his time on “Celebrity Big Brother” after a near-unanimous loss in Wednesday’s finale, Page Six confirms.
A rep for Hall did not immediately respond when Page Six asked why he pulled out of the interviews and whether he plans to reschedule.
@Todrick Such a big fan but an even bigger loser,” another echoed after Hall repeatedly boasted about being a “Big Brother” superfan.
Todrick Hall canceled interviews after coming in second place on “Celebrity Big Brother.” CBSHall, 36, finished in second place after receiving only one of eight votes, courtesy of Bailey, 55.

     ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ Winner Miesha Tate Defends Todrick Hall
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Miesha Tate is still trying to process things after being crowned the winner of Celebrity Big Brother season 3 on Wednesday, February 23.
But I don’t think it was as well-received when we’re playing the Celebrity Big Brother.
Do you think Todrick will talk to them or reflect on those moments?
I am not apprised to all of this, and I didn’t know that those two things were focal points.
So I don’t truthfully know a lot of those things that have been said or how they were taken in context, or out of context, or I don’t know.
