REUTERS/Gleb Garanich/File PhotoFeb 25 (Reuters) - Ukraine's nuclear agency and interior ministry said on Friday they were recording increased radiation levels from the site of the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
Experts at the state nuclear agency did not provide exact radiation levels but said the change was due to the movement of heavy military equipment in the area lifting radioactive dust into the air.
It is not critical for Kyiv for the time being, but we are monitoring," the interior ministry said.
Ukraine's neighbour Poland said it had not recorded any increase in radiation levels on its territory.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SOCHI, Russia — Russia’s Defense Ministry said in a statement on Friday that its paratroopers had taken control of the territory around the former Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine and were working with Ukrainian guards to ensure the safety of its facilities, contradicting Ukrainian claims that Russian forces were holding the plant’s personnel hostage.
“The radiation level around the nuclear plant is within limits,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the ministry’s spokesman, said in a statement.
“The plant’s staff continues to service its facilities and monitor radioactivity.”Ukraine’s government-run nuclear watchdog confirmed in a statement that Russian forces captured the area around the former plant, adding that all facilities “are under control and are being serviced by the plant’s staff.”Earlier Ukrainian officials said that they “took its staff hostage.”“This puts not only Ukrainian, but European security under threat,” said Alyona Shevtsova, a Ukrainian military official.

Some Russian military massed in the Chernobyl "exclusion zone" before crossing into Ukraine early on Thursday, a Russian security source said.

     Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) Russian forces have seized control of the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, and are holding staff hostage, according to Ukranian officials.
Troops overran the plant on the first day of Russia's multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine , a spokesperson for the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management, Yevgeniya Kuznetsovа, told CNN.
Alyona Shevtsova, advisor to the commander of Ukraine's Ground Forces, said on Facebook that Russian forces have taken control of the power station and that the staff are being "held hostage."
According to Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, control of the Chornobyl zone was lost after a "fierce battle."
Podolyak said the condition of the former Chernobyl power plant's nuclear waste storage facilities is unknown.

     Major gun battle breaks out between Russian and Ukrainian forces at the stricken radioactive site, with its safety status now unclear.
Fighting broke out after Russia invaded Ukraine at the Chernobyl nuclear plant where radioactivity is still leaking from history’s worst nuclear disaster 36 years ago.
I mean, Ukraine has 15 active nuclear reactors and nuclear waste in Chernobyl: one mortar miss, and everyone in Europe is facing a major nuclear catastrophe,” Novikov told Al Jazeera.
A senior American intelligence official said the US believes Russian forces at Chernobyl were aiming to push to Kyiv, 130km (80 miles) away, to try to link with other Russian forces throughout Ukraine.

     Few places conjure more foreboding than Chernobyl, the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster.
Why would Russia make a radioactive wasteland one of its very first targets in Ukraine?
"If Russian forces were attacking Kyiv from the north, Chernobyl is right there on the way, almost in the way."
Chernobyl is less than 10 miles from Ukraine's border with Belarus, a Russian ally where Moscow has been massing troops in preparation for its attack.
"They want it because they want to take control of the whole effing country," said Evelyn Farkas, who was deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia in the Obama administration.

     Explainer: Why Russia and Ukraine are fighting for Chernobyl disaster site
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     REUTERS/Gleb GaranichWASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Russian and Ukrainian forces fought on Thursday for control of Chernobyl, the still radioactive site of the world's worst nuclear accident and a factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union.
In seizing Chernobyl, Western military analysts said Russia was simply using the fastest invasion route from Belarus, an ally of Moscow and a staging ground for Russian troops, to Kyiv.
The radioactive strontium, caesium and plutonium mainly affected Ukraine and neighboring Belarus, as well as parts of Russia and Europe.
Ukraine's four operational nuclear power plants are running safely and there has been no "destruction" at the remaining waste and other facilities at Chernobyl, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Thursday, citing Ukraine's nuclear regulator.

Earlier in the day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke out against the assault on the plant.
There hasn’t been a functioning reactor at Chernobyl since 2000, and Ukraine had designated the approximately 1,000-square-mile area around the plant as an off-limits exclusion zone.
Because the shortest route from the Russian border to Kyiv passes through Chernobyl, Ukraine deployed security forces to keep watch over the area two months ago.
