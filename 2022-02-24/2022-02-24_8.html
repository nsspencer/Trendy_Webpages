     U.S. troops in Poland prepare for the arrival of refugees from Ukraine.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     U.S. Army troops are preparing to move closer to Poland’s border with Ukraine to help process people fleeing the country after Russia launched an all-out assault, an Army spokesman said on Thursday, as Poland said it was ready to provide shelter to anyone fleeing the conflict.
Many of the 5,500 troops who arrived in Poland this month have been working with Polish forces to set up three processing centers near the border to help deal with tens of thousands of people, including Americans, who are expected to flee neighboring Ukraine.
American officials have estimated that a nationwide attack on Ukraine could result in one million to five million refugees, with many of them going to Poland.
That could lead to the largest arrival of refugees in Europe since more than one million migrants and refugees arrived in 2015, a dynamic that had a profound effect on European politics by bolstering far-right parties.
But the flow is expected to grow as the conflict intensifies and expands.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     BERLIN (Reuters) – Germany will offer support to countries in eastern Europe, especially Poland, facing an influx of refugees from the conflict in Ukraine, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said on Thursday.
“We will offer massive support to the affected states – especially our neighbour Poland – in the event of large refugee movements,” Faeser said in a statement.
She added that German security authorities had stepped up protective measures against possible cyber attacks.

     MIBR and Imperial to leave boot camp in Poland amid Russian invasion of Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Brazilian CS:GO teams MIBR and Imperial are set to leave their boot camp in Warsaw, Poland today as a result of the Russian attacks on Ukraine, both teams told Globo Esporte.
The players and staff of MIBR and Imperial are planning to fly back to Brazil today, four days ahead of what they originally planned.
MIBR stayed on Polish soil after their participation in the IEM Katowice play-in stage and were set to play in Pinnacle Winter Series Two, an online tier-two tournament.
GODSENT, another Brazilian team, also stayed in Katowice, Poland after they were knocked out of the IEM Katowice play-in stage on Feb. 16.
ESL has maintained that the playoffs for IEM Katowice will go on as originally planned for now, even though there are several Russian and Ukrainian pros set to be in attendance.

     MEDYKA, Poland, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Ukrainians fleeing a Russian invasion have started trickling into Poland, with dozens arriving at the normally quiet Medyka crossing on Thursday, some carrying luggage and accompanied by children.
"I don't have any feelings other than that I am very scared," Bazhanov said at the pedestrian border crossing, about 400 km from Warsaw.
read more1/7 People stand at the border crossing between Poland and Ukraine, after Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a military operation in eastern Ukraine, in Medyka, Poland, February 24, 2022.
The Medyka crossing is largely used by people going shopping across the border or travelling for work.
News of the invasion spurred Olga Pavlusik and her boyfriend Bohdan Begey to rush to the border, leaving their dog at home in their town in western Ukraine.

     Poland, Lithuania Take Emergency Measures in Response to Ukraine Crisis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Lithuania introduced a state of emergency Thursday, and Poland put its army on a high state of alert, as the war in Ukraine reverberated through America’s easternmost allies in Europe.
President Gitanas Nausėda of Lithuania said the emergency decree would fallow for an increase of security deployments near the country’s borders with Russia and Belarus.
Poland’s decision would keep active military personnel on duty, canceling leaves of absence and rotations home for the foreseeable future.
The war in Ukraine is sparking a ramping up of military assets in the east of Europe.
On Thursday, the first deployment of about 40 U.S. troops arrived in Latvia, with more set to land in Lithuania and Estonia soon.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Russian military launched attacks across Ukraine on Thursday, including near the city of Lviv, just 85 kilometers from the Polish border.
Poland will make sure refugees receive food, medical help and information at the centers, he said.
Adam Niedzielski, the health minister, said Poland will set up a special medical train to ferry injured people to 120 Polish hospitals.
There were no immediate reports of a surge of people trying to cross into Poland; Szefernaker said Poland’s border crossings with Ukraine were only moderately busy.
The government said in early February that it would accept even 1 million Ukrainian refugees if necessary.
