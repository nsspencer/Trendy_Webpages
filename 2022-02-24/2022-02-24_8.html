    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Update: The New York Knicks have confirmed the news with a statement from President Leon Rose.
According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Kemba Walker and the New York Knicks have agreed to have him sit out for the rest of the season.
The four-time All-Star played in 37 games for the Knicks this season, and has averages of 11.6 points, 3.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game.
Prior to this season, he had been on the Boston Celtics for each of the last two seasons.
After being traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder last off-season, he was bought out of his contract and then signed with the Knicks.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It was announced on Wednesday that the New York Knicks and Kemba Walker had come to an agreement that will see the former All-Star remain sidelined for the remainder of the season.
Rose also mentioned that Walker plans to “prepare for next season.”With that in mind, it’s highly likely that Walker ends up on a different team next year.
5 teams that should target Kemba Walker this summer: Charlotte HornetsThis one was too obvious to not be mentioned.
Kemba Walker spent the large majority of his career with the Charlotte Hornets, so it would make sense for them to bring him back.
That being said, the storyline of Walker heading back to Charlotte would be a heartwarming one.

     Knicks May Turn to Fan-Favorite PG to Replace Kemba Walker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The New York Knicks had to make changes to their team, and the writing was on the wall for the latest one.
On February 23, it was announced that an agreement between Kemba Walker and the Knicks would see the former All-Star sit out the remainder of the season.

It’s a cycle Knicks fans know all too well, and many are begging to see the fan-favorite get some playing time.
When Walker was removed from the rotation initially, he was replaced in the starting lineup with Alec Burks, somebody who is not usually a point guard.

     Knicks’ Kemba Walker trade strategy following benching, revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kemba Walker’s homecoming to the New York Knicks has gone poorly for everyone.
Since the Knicks didn’t trade Walker or buy him out of his contract, questions arose on why the team chose this course.
According to SNY’s Ian Begley, New York is looking to trade Walker this offseason, where his trade value will be more solidified.
It’s worth noting that the Knicks didn’t aggressively pursue trades involving Walker ahead of the deadline.
New York decided Walker would have more trade value in the offseason, when he will be on an expiring contract.

     Knicks to Bench Kemba Walker for Remainder of Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Knicks and Walker agreed that he would get benched and sit out the remainder of the season so other guards can get much-needed playing time.
In 37 games with the Knicks this season, Walker averaged 11.6 points, 3.5 assists, and 3.0 rebounds per game.
Kemba Benched in DecemberWalker began the season as a starter, but the Knicks stumbled out of the gate.
We know now that the Knicks had much bigger problems then Walker, because the Knicks actually got even worse after they benched Walker.
“We fully support Kemba’s decision to shut it down for the remainder of the season and use this time to prepare for next season,” said Knicks President Leon Rose.
