     Sally Kellerman, Oscar-Nominated ‘MASH’ Actress, Is Dead at 84
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sally Kellerman, the willowy, sultry-voiced actress and singer whose portrayal of Maj. Margaret (Hot Lips) Houlihan in the 1970 dark comedy “MASH” earned her an Oscar nomination, died on Thursday at an assisted-living facility in Los Angeles.
In her decades-long career in film and television, she was best known for her role as the strait-laced but alluring Army nurse in “MASH,” which also landed Ms. Kellerman rave reviews and a Golden Globe Award.
(When “MASH” was adapted into a TV series, Ms. Kellerman’s character was played by Loretta Swit.)
Ms. Kellerman went on to appear in several other films directed by Mr. Altman, including “Brewster McCloud” (1970) and “Welcome to L.A.” (1976).
Like other actors, she was attracted to working with Mr. Altman because of the leeway he allowed in interpreting scripts and improvising scenes.

     Sally Kellerman, Hot Lips Houlihan in ‘M*A*S*H,’ Dies at 84
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sally Kellerman, the husky-voiced actress known for her Oscar-nominated portrayal of U.S. Army Maj. Margaret “Hot Lips” Houlihan in Robert Altman’s M*A*S*H, has died.
But I think that [torment] really saved Hot Lips.
Stars would line up to work for nothing for Bob Altman.”She added, “Oh, the Altman film I turned down?
While attending Hollywood High School, Kellerman starred in a production of Meet Me in St. Louis and submitted a demo to jazz impresario Norman Granz.
But I happened to be wearing lipstick, and while I was talking a mile a minute, producer Ingo Preminger kept muttering in his German accent, ‘Hot Lips!’ … [Altman] yelled ‘Hot Lips’ too.”The film and Hooker’s novel, of course, also inspired the CBS series M*A*S*H, which ran from 1972-83.
