     Biden unveils new Russia sanctions over Ukraine invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     US president says Russia will face ‘severe cost’ for attacking Ukraine, accusing Vladimir Putin of choosing war.
Washington, DC – United States President Joe Biden has announced new sanctions against Russia, vowing to impose a “severe cost” on the country for its invasion of Ukraine.
Thursday’s measures did not target the Russian president personally, but Biden said sanctioning Putin is “on the table”.
Penalties were also announced against 24 individuals and entities, including two state-owned banks, in Belarus, which is hosting Russian troops participating in the invasion.
Fisher said the White House has suggested that more sanctions could be issued if Russia does not end its attack on Ukraine.

     In Unflinching Speech, Biden Vows That Putin Will “Bear the Consequences” for War
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Putin committed an assault on the very principles that uphold global peace,” Biden said in a searing speech Thursday afternoon, following a virtual meeting with G7 leaders.
“Putin is the aggressor,” Biden said.
But he urged “resolve” while the sanctions take effect, cautioning that Putin “has much larger ambitions than Ukraine.”“He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union,” Biden said.
Other conservatives, however, continued to place blame on Biden, as Donald Trump did on Wednesday evening while praising Putin as “smart” for the second time this week.
“We now have war in Europe on a scale and of a type we thought belonged to history."

     Transcript: President Biden addresses Russia's 'brutal assault' on Ukraine, further sanctions on Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     President Joe Biden Thursday announced a new round of severe sanctions against Russia and President Vladimir Putin, denouncing the "brutal" invasion of Ukraine that began in the early hours of Thursday morning.
Here’s a full transcript of Biden’s nearly 14-minute speech:World:Who are Russia's allies in the Ukraine conflict and what is their stance?
We have purposely designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and our allies.
In addition to the economic penalties we’re imposing, we're also taking steps to defend our NATO allies, particularly in the East.
But it is a vision that the United States and freedom-loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power.

     I want to be clear the United States is not doing this alone.
In addition to the economic penalties we’re imposing we’re also taking steps to defend our Nato allies, particularly in the east.
This will enable Nato’s high readiness forces to deploy where and when they’re needed to protect our Nato allies on the eastern boundaries of Europe.
But it is a vision that the United States and freedom loving nations will oppose with every tool fo ur considerable power.
The United States and our allies and partners will emerge from this stronger, more united, more determined and more purposeful.
