     Ukraine crisis: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plummet after Russia launches military strikes

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Bitcoin fell by as much as 7.9 per cent to $34,324 (€30,570), its lowest since January 24, and was last trading down 4.5 per cent.
Smaller coins that typically move in tandem with Bitcoin also fell, with Ether losing as much as 10.8 per cent.
Russian sanctionsThe United States and its allies will impose "severe sanctions" on Russia after the attacks, US President Joe Biden said.
EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell also promised the toughest financial sanctions the bloc had ever imposed.
While cryptocurrency proponents say Bitcoin acts as a safe haven from geopolitical tensions, it often moves in tandem with other risk-on assets.

     Bitcoin ($BTC) Price Crashes Nearly 10% as Russia Invades Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The price of the flagship cryptocurrency bitcoin ($BTC) has plunged nearly 10% over the last 24 hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “special military operation” against Ukraine in what appears to be a full-scale invasion of the country.
According to data from CryptoCompare, BTC’s price is now down to $35,200, from around $39,000 24 hours ago.
Russia’s military action has also affected equities markets, with European indices dropping between 2% and 4% at the time of writing.
Russia’s MOEX index was at one point down 45% and is at the time of writing down by 28.5%.
As reported, strategists at JPMorgan Chase led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou have revealed they see Bitcoin’s current “fair value” at around $38,000, while their theoretical BTC price target is at $150,000.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Bitcoin (BTC) edged higher after Wall Street opened on Feb. 24 with Russia's Ukraine invasion and its aftermath still top on markets' agenda.
Skittish markets faced the music from Russia's overnight incursion into Ukraine, a move that continued and ricocheted across global trading.
"At the start of the week, escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine had hit crypto markets hard.
Our crypto indices were already showing sizeable losses across all sectors," Sahil Sakhrani, a market analyst at crypto research firm Macro Hive, told Cointelegraph.
With the correlation between Bitcoin and NASDAQ picking up again, broader risk sentiment will likely be the dominant driver of crypto markets."

     FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried in a Twitter thread on Thursday speculated on why Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) market price is taking such a harsher beating from the Russia-Ukraine crisis compared to equities.
"If you were in Ukraine right now, where would you trust your money?"
if S&amp;P500 moves 1%, BTC moves 4%).

     Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu All Plunged Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     What happenedIt's safe to say the cryptocurrency market is crashing today as the market sells almost every asset class on news of Russia invading Ukraine.
In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin ( BTC -1.87% ) has fallen as much as 11.2%, Ethereum ( ETH -1.22% ) fell 15%, Dogecoin ( DOGE -4.55% ) dropped 18.2%, and Shiba Inu ( SHIB -5.87% ) fell a whopping 20% at its low.
Cryptocurrencies have been correlated with the stock market for months now and they're typically more volatile than the market, meaning their moves are larger than the typical stock.
We're seeing that today as investors flee from risky assets and buy assets deemed safer like utility stocks and oil.
Meanwhile, traditional investors in the stock market have moved into cryptocurrency, which brings with it some of the same market swings we see with stocks.

     Bitcoin Investors Haven’t Responded To Russia-Ukraine War With Large Inflows (Yet)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On-chain data shows Bitcoin investors haven’t moved large amounts to exchanges in response to the Russia-Ukraine war (at least for now).
Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Doesn’t Spike Up Following The War Breakout Between Russia And UkraineAs pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC reserve hasn’t moved significantly after the news of the Russia-Ukraine war.
The “all exchanges reserve” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin sitting in wallets of all exchanges.
When the value of this metric rises, it means exchanges are receiving net inflows as investors deposit their coins.
This would imply that those storing their coins in personal wallets haven’t panic transferred their Bitcoin to exchanges for selling, yet.

     Crypto bosses surprised by BTC war plungeSamson Mow, chief executive of social mobile games developer Pixelmatic and chief strategy officer at blockchain technology company Blockstream, wrote on Twitter: “Bitcoin is trading like a risk-on asset, but it is not a risk-on asset.”#Bitcoin is trading like a risk-on asset, but it is *not* a risk-on asset.
He wrote: “In the last day, the S&amp;P 500 is down about 4%, and BTC is down about 8%.
Since 2020, BTC performance often correlated with equity market benchmarks, such as the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composites.
“They see it as a risk-on asset.
Indeed, crypto diehards have seen the market change many times and believe bitcoin could regain its haven status as the conflict deepens.
