     Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor reconcile after 2017 split
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) There were shockwaves in 2017 when Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor's marriage unraveled after 17 years.
Now they are back together and they credit the pandemic, in part, for their reconciliation.
In a recently published interview in Esquire, Stiller said he and Taylor agreed early in the pandemic for him to move back into their family home so he'd be able to spend time with their children.
Unexpected, and one of the things that came out of the pandemic."
The actor turned director met Taylor, best known for her role in the "Brady Bunch Movie," met in 1999 and married the following year.

     Nearly four years after Ben Stiller and wife Christine Taylor announced their separation, the couple is officially giving their marriage another shot.
Stiller, 56, told Esquire in an interview published on Tuesday that he moved back in with Taylor, 50, and their children amid lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Night at the Museum star also had a funny way of explaining his discovery of what makes a marriage work.
I like watching people ride horses, I like watching my kids ride horses,” he said.

     During a pandemic era that emphasizes distance, Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor grew closer.
But in an interview with Esquire published Tuesday, the "Zoolander" actor says he and Taylor are back together after they decided to move back in with each other at the onset of the pandemic.
"Over the course of time, it evolved," Stiller said.
"I think accepting that, you can really appreciate someone more because you’re not trying to get them to change for you," Stiller said.
"It’s almost the longer that they’re (living) there, the more it seems they’re never going to go away,” he said.
