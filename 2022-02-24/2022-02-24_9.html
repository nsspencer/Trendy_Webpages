     Nearly four years after Ben Stiller and wife Christine Taylor announced their separation, the couple is officially giving their marriage another shot.
Stiller, 56, told Esquire in an interview published on Tuesday that he moved back in with Taylor, 50, and their children amid lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Night at the Museum star also had a funny way of explaining his discovery of what makes a marriage work.
I like watching people ride horses, I like watching my kids ride horses,” he said.

     During a pandemic era that emphasizes distance, Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor grew closer.
But in an interview with Esquire published Tuesday, the "Zoolander" actor says he and Taylor are back together after they decided to move back in with each other at the onset of the pandemic.
"Over the course of time, it evolved," Stiller said.
"I think accepting that, you can really appreciate someone more because you’re not trying to get them to change for you," Stiller said.
"It’s almost the longer that they’re (living) there, the more it seems they’re never going to go away,” he said.
