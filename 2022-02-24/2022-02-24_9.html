REUTERS/Gleb Garanich/File PhotoFeb 25 (Reuters) - Ukraine's nuclear agency and interior ministry said on Friday they were recording increased radiation levels from the site of the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
Experts at the state nuclear agency did not provide exact radiation levels but said the change was due to the movement of heavy military equipment in the area lifting radioactive dust into the air.
It is not critical for Kyiv for the time being, but we are monitoring," the interior ministry said.
Ukraine's neighbour Poland said it had not recorded any increase in radiation levels on its territory.

     KYIV, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The Chernobyl nuclear power plant has been captured by Russian forces, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Thursday.
"It is impossible to say the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe after a totally pointless attack by the Russians," he said.
Some Russian military massed in the Chernobyl "exclusion zone" before crossing into Ukraine early on Thursday, a Russian security source said.

"Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted shortly before the power plant was captured.

     Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) Russian forces have seized control of the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, and are holding staff hostage, according to Ukranian officials.
Troops overran the plant on the first day of Russia's multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine , a spokesperson for the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management, Yevgeniya Kuznetsov–∞, told CNN.
Alyona Shevtsova, advisor to the commander of Ukraine's Ground Forces, said on Facebook that Russian forces have taken control of the power station and that the staff are being "held hostage."
According to Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, control of the Chornobyl zone was lost after a "fierce battle."
Podolyak said the condition of the former Chernobyl power plant's nuclear waste storage facilities is unknown.

     Few places conjure more foreboding than Chernobyl, the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster.
Why would Russia make a radioactive wasteland one of its very first targets in Ukraine?
"If Russian forces were attacking Kyiv from the north, Chernobyl is right there on the way, almost in the way."
Chernobyl is less than 10 miles from Ukraine's border with Belarus, a Russian ally where Moscow has been massing troops in preparation for its attack.
"They want it because they want to take control of the whole effing country," said Evelyn Farkas, who was deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia in the Obama administration.

     Explainer: Why Russia and Ukraine are fighting for Chernobyl disaster site
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     REUTERS/Gleb GaranichWASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Russian and Ukrainian forces fought on Thursday for control of Chernobyl, the still radioactive site of the world's worst nuclear accident and a factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union.
In seizing Chernobyl, Western military analysts said Russia was simply using the fastest invasion route from Belarus, an ally of Moscow and a staging ground for Russian troops, to Kyiv.
The radioactive strontium, caesium and plutonium mainly affected Ukraine and neighboring Belarus, as well as parts of Russia and Europe.
Ukraine's four operational nuclear power plants are running safely and there has been no "destruction" at the remaining waste and other facilities at Chernobyl, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Thursday, citing Ukraine's nuclear regulator.

The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, a 2,600-square-kilometer (1,000-square-mile) zone of forest surrounding the shuttered plant, lies between the Belarus-Ukraine border and the Ukrainian capital.
Ukraine decided to use the deserted zone as the site for its centralized storage facility for spent fuel from the country‚Äôs other remaining nuclear power plants.
