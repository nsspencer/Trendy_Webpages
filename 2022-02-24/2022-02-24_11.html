    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AUSTIN (WBAP/KLIF News) – Crude oil prices soared to $100 per barrel Thursday and the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a key factor.
The situation sent crude oil prices soaring and Texans will feel the pinch.
According to AAA Texas, gas prices are 35% higher than they were a year ago.
“The upward momentum from pump prices may have paused for a moment, but don’t expect the slowdown to become a trend as crude oil prices continue to rise amid geopolitical and supply chain issues,” said AAA Texas spokesperson Daniel Armbruster.

     Two Wild Cards That Could Send Oil and Gas Prices Even Higher
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Text sizeRussia’s invasion of Ukraine caused oil and gas prices to shoot higher on Thursday, but the next move by the U.S. and Europe could cause an even larger increase.
Dutch natural gas prices jumped 59%, to 141 euros per megawatt hour on Thursday, which could lead to high power bills for European consumers.
Oil analysts had already been predicting that oil prices would stay strong, with or without a Russian invasion.
Absent a recession, supply shortages should keep oil prices high for a sustained period.
Currently the U.S. imports about 150,000 to 200,000 barrels of Russian oil and about 500,000 barrels of refined products a day.

It’s been nearly 14 years since Kansans paid more than $4 per gallon of unleaded gas and there’s concern that this streak could end.
Looking at gas prices over the last 20 years, AAA shows the three highest average monthly prices for unleaded gas for Kansas were in 2008 and 2012.
During the summer of 2008, average prices hit $3.95 per gallon.
The most recent point we’ve hit gas prices about $3.70 was in 2012.

     Soaring US gas prices are likely to get even worse after Russia launched a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine — with some experts warning that costs could climb to $5 per gallon or higher in the coming months.
APPresident Biden and others have already warned the Russia-Ukraine conflict could result in higher gas prices.
Some industry analysts predict prices will jump even higher if a prolonged military conflict between Russia and Ukraine ensues.
Energy Word founder Dan Dicker is among those predicting a record surge in consumer gas prices.
Bloomberg via Getty ImagesDicker cited massive spikes in demand for fuel as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as strong economic growth, as key factors pushing gas prices higher.

     Earlier in February, JPMorgan analysts projected that disruptions to oil flows from Russia could push oil prices to $120 per barrel.
Gas prices matter not just for people filling up the tanks of their cars but also because of shipping and transportation.
By his calculation, an increase in oil prices to $110 could increase consumer prices by 2.8 percent over the course of a year.
“It becomes a question of: How long do oil prices, natural gas wholesale prices stay elevated?” he told the Times.
“It’s no Russia, in terms of oil supply.”Higher oil prices could also weigh on economic growth.
