     Bitcoin and Ether Plunge as Russia Attacks Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Bitcoin fell hard as Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
In early afternoon in New York, Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, was down 6.6% over the past 24 hours to $35,982, according to CoinDesk, after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an attack on Ukraine, with Russian troops and tanks entering Ukraine and airstrikes pounding Ukraine’s capital and other cities.
Bitcoin fell Thursday to as low as $34,338, the lowest levels since late January.

     Bitcoin price falls after Russia attacks Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     New York/ Hong Kong (CNN Business) The price of bitcoin fell below $35,000 early Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in the Donbas region of Ukraine .
Bitcoin was trading at $34,969 as of 1:22 a.m.
"They are hesitant to increase holdings given the tremendous uncertainty for risky assets," he added.
Moya predicted that bitcoin would likely continue to "see decent resistance from the $40,000 level as geopolitical tensions will prevent risky assets from mustering up much of a rally."

     Bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptos plunge as Russia invades Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ethereum nosedived on Thursday morning as investors reacted to Russia’s ruthless invasion of Ukraine.
Bitcoin was trading down 4.5% at around $35,600 on Thursday morning, while ethereum fell 6% to about $2,430, according to Coinbase data.
About $150 billion has been wiped off the broader cryptocurrency market since Russia’s invasion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
“Bitcoin is not a hedge against geopolitical risks,” Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies economist Philipp Heimberger declared on Twitter in response to Thursday’s plunge.
Russia could further embrace cryptocurrencies as the country is hit with Western sanctions, analysts say.

     Bitcoin Price Down 10% Following Russia’s Full-Scale Attack on Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Bitcoin price dropped as much as $34k earlier today, prompting a major crypto sell-off amid the news on the start of the Russian attack on Ukraine.
Mind you, market strategists have shown how the rising Russia-Ukraine conflict might affect Bitcoin and the entire crypto market.
Otherwise, the crypto market is also reacting to h the United States monetary policy including interest rates hikes.
Side NotesThe crypto market has stamped its yearly bear market following the past two year’s bull market.
The entire crypto market cap stands around $1.64 trillion, having dropped approximately 11 percent in the past 24 hours.

     Hedge in times of trouble? Bitcoin drops to one-month low
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Bitcoin fell as much as 8.5 percent to $34,337 while Ether declined as much as 12 percent to $2,301 as Russia’s attacks on targets across Ukraine sent risk assets reeling.
Cryptocurrencies extended declines as Russia’s attacks on targets across Ukraine sent risk assets reeling, with Bitcoin slumping to a one-month low.
While Bitcoin pared its loss, it’s still down almost 50% from its all-time high set in November.
Bitcoin’s swings during the past weeks of escalating geopolitical tensions have undermined the argument that cryptocurrencies offer a hedge in times of trouble.
If that threshold gets breached, “we could be looking at much lower levels in the low $20,000s and below.”

     How the U.S. benefits when China turns its back on Bitcoin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     toggle caption Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for CoinGeekChina cracked down on bitcoin mining and transactions last yearWhy were all these Chinese bitcoin enthusiasts calling Nebraska?
For years, it had been the global hub for bitcoin mining for one simple reason: power was cheap.
Curtailment meant a good portion of this renewable energy was wasted — until bitcoin miners came along about a decade ago, after bitcoin officially began trading globally.
But authorities turned a blind eye to bitcoin miners operating there at the time.
China had signaled several times before it would shut down bitcoin mining, only to walk those measures back.

     Russia-Ukraine crisis burnishes gold's safe-haven shine as Bitcoin lags
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With a global conflict afoot, gold (GC=F) has revived its status as a safe-haven in times of turmoil.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar — the world's premier reserve currency and another safe-haven during market duress — is gaining ground against a broad basket of currencies.
However, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is behaving like the rest of the risk-sensitive market — which is to say its price is dropping like a rock.
"This sort of challenges this narrative of bitcoin being a unique asset because it's performing like stocks."
No matter what, investors can sell it immediately, said Baxter Hines, Chief Investment Officer with Honeycomb Digital assets.
