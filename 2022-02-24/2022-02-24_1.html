     MARQUETTE, MI – It’s been a record-breaking couple days in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.
According to the National Weather Service in Marquette, several snowfall and precipitation records were broken on Monday and Tuesday.

The previous record for snowfall on Feb. 22 was just 7.5 inches in 1974.
“While the previous records were on the lower end, we did set new precipitation and snow records the last two days.

     Corrections officer admits breaking wrist of handcuffed teen, officials say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A corrections officer at a youth jail in Burlington County admitted Wednesday he broke the wrist of a handcuffed teen during an attack at the facility in 2020, officials said.
Under his plea agreement, Day, who is inactive and pending retirement, will face 364 in county jail when he is sentenced on April 13, Platkin said.
“This guilty plea reflects our resolve to hold law enforcement officers accountable if they use unjustified and excessive force against civilians,” Platkin said.
The teen was handcuffed with his arms behind his back, authorities said.
“Day then grabbed hold of the juvenile’s handcuffed wrists and twisted and broke one of them,” Platkin said.

     He must forfeit his state position and will be permanently barred from public office or employment.
Day was charged as the result of an investigation by the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability (OPIA) Corruption Bureau and JJC’s Office of Investigations.
“This guilty plea reflects our resolve to hold law enforcement officers accountable if they use unjustified and excessive force against civilians,” said Acting Attorney General Platkin.
Deputy Attorney General Brian Uzdavinis prosecuted the case, under the supervision of OPIA Corruption Bureau Chief Peter Lee and OPIA Deputy Director Anthony Picione.
Acting Attorney General Platkin thanked JJC’s Office of Investigations for assisting in the investigation.
