     Miesha Tate wins Celebrity Big Brother final 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Miesha Tate has been crowned the winner of Celebrity Big Brother 2022 after receiving all but one of the jury’s votes.
The former UFC bantamweight champion beat American YouTube star Todrick Hall in the final two after the jury made up of their former housemates including Carson Kressley and Lamar Odom voted 7-1 in her favour.
A clearly-gobsmacked Cupcake could hardly believe it as she told host Julie Chen Moonves she was almost lost for words after winning the $250,000 grand prize.
LAS VEGAS, NV – MARCH 5: Miesha Tate prior to her bout against UFC bantamweight champion Holly Holm during UFC 196 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on March 5, 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada.
The American, who has competed at bantamweight throughout her career, will be making her flyweight debut.

     Todrick Hall ‘cancels all interviews’ after Celebrity Big Brother backlash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Todrick Hall reportedly cancelled all of his interviews after leaving the Celebrity Big Brother house, following heavy criticism from viewers over his behaviour on the reality show.
Broadcaster CBS told US media late on 23 February that Hall had abruptly cancelled his scheduled exit interviews, after the conclusion of the final.
After his elimination from Celebrity Big Brother, former Diff’rent Strokes actor Todd Bridges watched previously aired episodes and learned that Hall had not been fully transparent with his strategy.
Todrick Hall in 'Celebrity Big Brother’ (CBS)“Todrick was amazing at convincing us of — excuse my language — bulls**t,” Bridges told Us Weekly.
“He is legit talking about playing his fans on cameo for money, boy bye.”The Independent has contacted Todrick Hall’s representative for comment.

     Going into the final vote between you and Todrick, how confident were you that you were going to win?
But remember that the way that "Celebrity Big Brother" is run is different than regular "Big Brother."
I didn't really understand the game coming in to a very deep degree.
So I was able to get just barely the majority of the House vote.
I'm like, Oh my God, I think I'm gonna have to go back on my word, and I did not like that.
