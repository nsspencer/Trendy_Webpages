     Gold Touches Highest Since 2020 as Ukraine Crisis Boosts Havens
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Gold surged to the highest since September 2020 after Russian forces attacked targets across Ukraine, triggering the worst security crisis in Europe since World War II and crushing risk sentiment.
President Vladimir Putin vowed to “demilitarize” Ukraine and replace its leaders.
The European Union, U.S. and U.K. promised more sanctions they said would hit Russia’s economy and financial sector hard.

     Gold price blasts to 15-month peak as war returns to Europe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     [Click here for an interactive chart of gold prices]On Wednesday evening, Russia President Vladimir Putin vowed to “demilitarize” Ukraine and replace its leaders, while the West threatened additional sanctions in response.
“Investors are throwing shares out of their portfolios and fleeing to safe havens.”Evidently, US futures and European stocks both tumbled, while Treasuries rallied.
Analysts will now be forced to look carefully at their price forecasts for the year.
“It’s more than what the market was anticipating,” said RJO Futures senior market strategist Bob Haberkorn, in a Reuters report.
“A quick correction will ensue once the conflict’s intensity winds down.”“If Russia in fact does take Kiev and the international community has an aggressive response, gold will trade up over $2,000 fairly quickly,” RJO Futures’ Haberkorn predicted.

     Should you invest in gold? Here's what Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Gold price today at Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) ascended to its highest levels in 2022.
MCX gold rate today surged near ₹1,400 and hit intraday high of ₹51,750 per 10 gm levels in early morning trade.
In spot market, gold price breached its $1925 hurdle and has hit $1950 per ounce levels, around 13 month high.
So, next targets for spot gold price is $1980 and $2000, which might be achieved in short term.
This rise in gold price today can be attributed to fresh developments in Ukrain Russia crisis where speculation are high about Russia attacking Ukraine anytime."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are sharply higher in early U.S. trading Thursday.
A news headline from Barrons today read, "Russia has actually invaded Ukraine; markets are not ready for that fallout."
The extreme price moves seen in many markets today bear out that notion.
The key outside markets today see Nymex crude oil prices posting big gains and trading around $99.50 a barrel.
Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at $1,900.00.
