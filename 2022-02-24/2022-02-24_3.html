     With Russia's invasion of Ukraine roiling the stock market, making calm decisions is the best way forward
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     One of the most immediate effects has been in the stock market.
In a volatile day of trading, stock indexes rose in the U.S. on Thursday after steep declines earlier in the day.
While the geopolitical unrest is alarming for many reasons, the stock market swings are not something to panic about.
That's because the stock market is remarkably buoyant.
An example of this buoyancy is recent: The pandemic-related stock market crash of 2020 had the largest one-day loss in Dow Jones history, but the market quickly recovered by April of 2020.

     What is a stock market correction? And will it get worse as Russia invades Ukraine?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As Russia invades Ukraine and global markets waver, U.S. financial markets are flashing a key warning.
And since peaking in early January, that's exactly what the S&amp;P 500 index, the broadest gauge of the U.S. stock market, has fallen into.
However, correction can also turn into a bear market, Yardeni said.
A bear market is defined as a drop of 20% or more from a prior closing high.
In 2020, a correction did worsen into a bear market after the global economy suddenly shut down because of the pandemic.

     Russian Invasion Triggers ‘Scary’ Stock Market Correction—Here’s How Major Geopolitical Shocks Have Rattled Markets Before
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Crucial Quote“Geopolitics have a history of rattling markets, and stocks are likely to be on edge for the next several weeks,” Lindsey Bell, chief markets strategist at Ally Invest, said in emailed comments Thursday.
"The good news is that the impact tends to be short-lived, only lasting anywhere from one to three months.
Key BackgroundRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered a “special military operation” in Ukraine early Thursday in a chilling announcement that was immediately followed by reports of explosions across Ukraine.
Stock market futures plunged immediately on the news, with all three major indexes opening more than 2% lower.
"Should the market show signs of recovery in the coming days and weeks, the correction may have run its course—if not, the worst has yet to come .
