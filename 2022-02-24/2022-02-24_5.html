     It was almost a unanimous vote for Miesha to take home the title and the prize.
In the end, bringing Todrick along with her to the final two proved to be both an honest and strategic move.
Not only did the jury love Miesha’s gameplay, but they hated Todrick’s!
Teddi even served the best burn of the night when she told Todrick that even though he loves Wizard of Oz, he forgot that the jury “can see behind the curtain.”

     ”Celebrity Big Brother 2022” contestant Todrick Hall had a bone to pick with the show after he finished in second place, deciding not to grant any interviews following Wednesday night’s season 3 finale.
Hall canceled all interviews about his experience on “Celebrity Big Brother” after a near-unanimous loss in the season 3 finale, according to several entertainment reporters.
#CBBUS3 — Sharon Tharp (@sharontharp) February 24, 2022Just informed Todrick Hall will not be doing Celebrity Big Brother exit press tonight #CBBUS3 — Dalton Ross (@DaltonRoss) February 24, 2022UPDATE: Todrick has canceled his #CBBUS3 exit interviews for tonight.
Although “Big Brother” episodes are just one hour long, there are “live feeds” on the internet in which fans can watch the contestants 24 hours a day.
But despite not winning the show, Hall still got a $50,000 cash prize for second place.

Todrick Hall canceled interviews about his time on “Celebrity Big Brother” after a near-unanimous loss in Wednesday’s finale, Page Six confirms.
A rep for Hall did not immediately respond when Page Six asked why he pulled out of the interviews and whether he plans to reschedule.
@Todrick Such a big fan but an even bigger loser,” another echoed after Hall repeatedly boasted about being a “Big Brother” superfan.
Todrick Hall canceled interviews after coming in second place on “Celebrity Big Brother.” CBSHall, 36, finished in second place after receiving only one of eight votes, courtesy of Bailey, 55.

How dominant was her winning run on Celebrity Big Brother this season?

Finally, any chance of a two-hour Celebrity Big Brother finale next time so we can hear more from the jury?
I like the idea of a 90-minute finale and I also like the idea of convincing celebrities to a be sequestered jury!

     Celebrity Big Brother Cynthia Bailey Reacts to Her Lone Jury Vote and Her 'Small Victories' in the Game
    </h2>

     After every eviction, Parade’s Mike Bloom interviews the latest celebrity to leave the Big Brother house.
Cynthia, of course, wasn’t aware of the ramifications, ready to move forward with a new final four deal with Carson, Todrick and Miesha.
And basically, when our alliance fell apart with Carson, Shanna, and I, I was pretty much on my own trying just to figure it out.
And as a member of her alliance, we didn’t know she was going to do that.
Although I didn’t win Big Brother, I’m really proud that I even made it as far as I did because I did conquer some personal goals.
