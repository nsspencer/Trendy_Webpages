     During a pandemic era that emphasizes distance, Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor grew closer.
But in an interview with Esquire published Tuesday, the "Zoolander" actor says he and Taylor are back together after they decided to move back in with each other at the onset of the pandemic.
"Over the course of time, it evolved," Stiller said.
"I think accepting that, you can really appreciate someone more because you’re not trying to get them to change for you," Stiller said.
"It’s almost the longer that they’re (living) there, the more it seems they’re never going to go away,” he said.
