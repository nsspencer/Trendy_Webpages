Stiller and Taylor, both 50, have two children: Ella Olivia, 19, and 16-years-old Quinlin Dempsey.
The 56-years old filmmaker said, “Then, over the course of time, it evolved.
'This is something that works for me; this is something that doesn't work for me.'
If you have that trust level with your partner, you know that me saying 'I don't like doing that thing' is not me saying 'I don't like you'," the 'Meet the Parents' star added.

     During a pandemic era that emphasizes distance, Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor grew closer.
But in an interview with Esquire published Tuesday, the "Zoolander" actor says he and Taylor are back together after they decided to move back in with each other at the onset of the pandemic.
"Over the course of time, it evolved," Stiller said.
"I think accepting that, you can really appreciate someone more because you’re not trying to get them to change for you," Stiller said.
"It’s almost the longer that they’re (living) there, the more it seems they’re never going to go away,” he said.
