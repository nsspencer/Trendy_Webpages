     Tristan Thompson’s Debut Was Everything the Bulls Were Missing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Seven minutes is all Tristan Thompson needed to show Chicago Bulls fans why he’s in town.
In those first 7 minutes of his Bulls debut, the big man was a six-foot-nine ball of energy, scoring 5 points and grabbing 4 rebounds.
From the energy to the execution, it added an entirely new dynamic to this Bulls team.
For a Bulls team that has hauled in the 4th-fewest rebounds per game, Thompson certainly felt like a calculated target by this front office.
The 2.3 offensive rebounds per game he brought to the Bulls immediately became the best mark on the team.

That being the case, they will consistently need more than the nine points it got from Kevin Huerter in the 112-108 loss to the Chicago Bulls.
Make no mistake, Trae Young’s night wasn’t much better as the Hawks superstar finished with 14 points and 10 assists.

After finishing up the first half with five straight wins led by historic DeMar DeRozan performances, the team started the second half in the same fashion on Thursday.
For DeRozan, his historic streak of at least 35 points and shooting at least 50 percent from the field was extended to eight.
DeRozan came though when the Bulls needed him most with his team down by three with under a minute to go.
“When you’re in those moment, you’ve got to take them on,” said DeRozan of situations like he faced on Thursday.

The Chicago Bulls adding Tristan Thompson shows that the best is yet to come for this teamMr. Thompson is no stranger to being around a team that establishes a winning and championship-caliber atmosphere.
With various injuries that continue to haunt the Bulls, Thompson brightens the tunnel and enlightens the frontcourt a little bit.

     Michael Reinsdorf: The Bulls Will “For Sure Go Into the Tax” to Compete for a Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Johnson, Chicago Bulls chairman Michael Reinsdorf assured Bulls fans that the team will not hesitate to spend if there’s an opportunity to win an NBA title.
All you have to do is go back and look at the last number of championship teams, how many of them were in the luxury tax?
With the nature of the NBA and having a soft cap, if you want to compete for championships, you have to be willing to spend into the tax,” Michael Reinsdorf said on the latest edition of the Bulls Talk Podcast.
Even if it means paying the luxury tax to do so, which is good news for Bulls fans because this team can compete for a championship.
And, indeed, the Bulls’ first order of spending is right around the corner when Zach LaVine becomes a free agent eligible for a max contract from the Chicago Bulls, which Michael Reinsdorf hopes to get done: “My hope is that he’s here for years to come,” Reinsdorf said.
