     It was almost a unanimous vote for Miesha to take home the title and the prize.
In the end, bringing Todrick along with her to the final two proved to be both an honest and strategic move.
Not only did the jury love Miesha’s gameplay, but they hated Todrick’s!
Teddi even served the best burn of the night when she told Todrick that even though he loves Wizard of Oz, he forgot that the jury “can see behind the curtain.”
