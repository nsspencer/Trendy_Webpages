     Bitcoin price falls after Russia attacks Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     New York/ Hong Kong (CNN Business) The price of bitcoin fell below $35,000 early Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in the Donbas region of Ukraine .
Bitcoin was trading at $34,969 as of 1:22 a.m.
"They are hesitant to increase holdings given the tremendous uncertainty for risky assets," he added.
Moya predicted that bitcoin would likely continue to "see decent resistance from the $40,000 level as geopolitical tensions will prevent risky assets from mustering up much of a rally."

     Gold is up and bitcoin is down amid Russia attack on Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russia’s attack on Ukraine has upended the global investment market as gold has seen a major spike in value and bitcoin saw a tremendous dip.
What happened: Gold has jumped to its highest levels in more than a year amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, CNBC reports.
Gold is expected to climb to $1,969.30 per ounce, according to CNBC.
The coin has hovered around $35,000 in the hours after the attack, suffering at least an 8% drop compared to the day before, according to Coin Market Cap.
Why it matters: Bitcoin has often been considered digital gold, but the crisis between Russia and Ukraine shows the tremendous risk with the coin, per NBC News.
