     Germany offers Poland help with refugees from Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     BERLIN (Reuters) – Germany will offer support to countries in eastern Europe, especially Poland, facing an influx of refugees from the conflict in Ukraine, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said on Thursday.
“We will offer massive support to the affected states – especially our neighbour Poland – in the event of large refugee movements,” Faeser said in a statement.
She added that German security authorities had stepped up protective measures against possible cyber attacks.

     U.S. troops in Poland prepare for the arrival of refugees from Ukraine.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     U.S. Army troops are preparing to move closer to Poland’s border with Ukraine to help process people fleeing the country after Russia launched an all-out assault, an Army spokesman said on Thursday, as Poland said it was ready to provide shelter to anyone fleeing the conflict.
Many of the 5,500 troops who arrived in Poland this month have been working with Polish forces to set up three processing centers near the border to help deal with tens of thousands of people, including Americans, who are expected to flee neighboring Ukraine.
American officials have estimated that a nationwide attack on Ukraine could result in one million to five million refugees, with many of them going to Poland.
That could lead to the largest arrival of refugees in Europe since more than one million migrants and refugees arrived in 2015, a dynamic that had a profound effect on European politics by bolstering far-right parties.
But the flow is expected to grow as the conflict intensifies and expands.

     Poland opens reception centres for Ukrainian refugees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Bartłomiej Wójtowicz/PAPPoland has already opened eight reception centres for Ukrainian refugees at the Polish-Ukrainian border, in the Lubelskie and Podkarpackie provinces, south-eastern part of the country, a deputy interior minister announced on Thursday.
"Four centres are located in the localities of Dorohusk, Dolhobyczow, Zosin and Hrebenne in the Lubelskie province, and four in Korczowa, Medyka, Budomierz oraz Kroscienko in the Podkarpackie province," Pawel Szefernaker said on Thursday.
"A ninth centre will be open at the railway station in Przemysl, Podkarpackie province, in the coming hours," he added.
Earlier on Thursday, Szefernaker told a Radio Plus programme that Poland had for long been preparing a crisis management scenario.
Szefernaker said that the centres for Ukrainian refugees would offer them accommodation, medical assistance and all necessary information.

     Leaving behind possessions and pets, Ukrainians flee to Poland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     MEDYKA, Poland, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Ukrainians fleeing a Russian invasion have started trickling into Poland, with dozens arriving at the normally quiet Medyka crossing on Thursday, some carrying luggage and accompanied by children.
"I don't have any feelings other than that I am very scared," Bazhanov said at the pedestrian border crossing, about 400 km from Warsaw.
read more1/7 People stand at the border crossing between Poland and Ukraine, after Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a military operation in eastern Ukraine, in Medyka, Poland, February 24, 2022.
The Medyka crossing is largely used by people going shopping across the border or travelling for work.
News of the invasion spurred Olga Pavlusik and her boyfriend Bohdan Begey to rush to the border, leaving their dog at home in their town in western Ukraine.

     Poland prepares for flood of Ukrainian refugees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Russian military launched attacks across Ukraine on Thursday, including near the city of Lviv, just 85 kilometers from the Polish border.
Poland will make sure refugees receive food, medical help and information at the centers, he said.
Adam Niedzielski, the health minister, said Poland will set up a special medical train to ferry injured people to 120 Polish hospitals.
There were no immediate reports of a surge of people trying to cross into Poland; Szefernaker said Poland’s border crossings with Ukraine were only moderately busy.
The government said in early February that it would accept even 1 million Ukrainian refugees if necessary.
