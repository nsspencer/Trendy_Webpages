     Todrick Hall ‘cancels all interviews’ after Celebrity Big Brother backlash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Todrick Hall reportedly cancelled all of his interviews after leaving the Celebrity Big Brother house, following heavy criticism from viewers over his behaviour on the reality show.
Broadcaster CBS told US media late on 23 February that Hall had abruptly cancelled his scheduled exit interviews, after the conclusion of the final.
After his elimination from Celebrity Big Brother, former Diff’rent Strokes actor Todd Bridges watched previously aired episodes and learned that Hall had not been fully transparent with his strategy.
Todrick Hall in 'Celebrity Big Brother’ (CBS)“Todrick was amazing at convincing us of — excuse my language — bulls**t,” Bridges told Us Weekly.
“He is legit talking about playing his fans on cameo for money, boy bye.”The Independent has contacted Todrick Hall’s representative for comment.

I didn't really understand the game coming in to a very deep degree.
So I was able to get just barely the majority of the House vote.
I'm like, Oh my God, I think I'm gonna have to go back on my word, and I did not like that.
