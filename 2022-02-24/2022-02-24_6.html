     Taiwan reports nine Chinese aircraft in defense zone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Taiwan's defense ministry on Thursday said that nine Chinese aircraft had entered its air defense identification zone, just hours after Russia had launched an invasion into Ukraine.
The ministry said that the mission involved eight J-16 sorties and one Y-8 reconnaissance aircraft.
ADVERTISEMENTIn response, Taiwanese fighters were deployed to warn the Chinese aircraft and air defense missiles were scrambled to "monitor the activities," the ministry said, according to the newswire.
In December, a U.S. defense official said there was an "urgent" need to enhance defenses in Taiwan as the threat of China annexing the country was "real and dangerous."
"Bolstering Taiwan's defenses is an urgent task," said Ely Ratner, the assistant secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs.

     Taiwan warns Chinese aircraft flying in air defense zone day of Russia-Ukraine invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Taiwan scrambled its air force Thursday as nine Chinese aircraft have entered the island nation’s air defense zone, the Taiwan Ministry of Defense announced.
Taiwan increased its alert levels as Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine Thursday local time.
Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Tan Kefei stressed that Taiwan was a "core issue" for China and it would tolerate no foreign interference.
REP. GREEN ON RUSSIA INVASION: AMERICA HAS TO ACT, WE CANNOT WAIT"We urge the U.S. side to recognize the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue, stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan issue," Tan said, according to Reuters.
And China appeared to stress that coverage of Russia’s invasion could play into helping "solve the Taiwan issue once and for all."

Taiwan and Ukraine both have aggressive neighbors with expansionist tendencies who see history and ethnicity as trumping self-determination.
Still, we haven't seen the type of extensive intelligence—in the end highly accurate—that preceded Moscow's attack against Ukraine.
Taiwan is also likely to join U.S.-led export sanctions against Russia, severing the supply of key technologies.
A recent poll found only around one-quarter of respondents believed China would attack Taiwan following the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine.

     Taiwan warns off Chinese jets amid rising security fears after Ukraine invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     China, which claims self-governing Taiwan as its own territory, has ramped up a military intimidation campaign against the island in recent years, and regularly flies jets into its ADIZ.
The defence ministry said the latest mission involved eight Chinese J-16 fighters and one Y-8 reconnaissance aircraft, and that in response, Taiwanese fighters were sent up to warn the Chinese aircraft and air defence missiles were deployed to "monitor the activities".
China’s incursions usually coincide with high-level foreign visits or important occasions in Taiwan, and Thursday’s incident followed Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea.
Experts have previously warned that with the frequency of China’s “gray zone” incursions continuing to rise, Taiwan’s air force capabilities face the risk of being stretched too thin.
The report said that 554 incursions by different types of Chinese military aircraft took place over Taiwan’s ADIZ between September 2020 and August last year.

     Is Taiwan Next?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As Russian tanks roll over Ukraine, Vladimir Putin’s crisis will reverberate around the world, possibly most dangerously in the Taiwan Strait.
Gaining control over Taiwan, or as the party prefers to call it, “reunification,” is a primary goal of Chinese foreign policy.
In a world order where authoritarian states are more assertive and democratic allies are on the back foot, the chances of war over Taiwan increase.
It is impossible to predict with certainty what Xi may be thinking about Taiwan in the aftermath of Putin’s Ukraine war.
Unlike Putin when it comes to Ukraine, though, Xi isn’t amassing an invasion force on the strait separating Taiwan from the Chinese mainland.

     Taiwan fears China could take a leaf out of Russia’s playbook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As news unfolded of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, people thousands of miles away on Taiwan followed the developments with growing unease – some describing it as the “worst case scenario” for the self-governing island that China considers part of its territory.
As a small democracy that sits next to an imposing, autocratic neighbour, parallels have been drawn between Taiwan and Ukraine – with Taiwanese citizens, officials, and world leaders alike concerned Beijing could seize upon the crisis to ramp up pressure on or even attack the island.
“How the world is reacting to Ukraine could be exactly how the world reacts to Taiwan [in the case of a Chinese invasion],” said Kathy Cheng, an entrepreneur who runs a gift registry website.
“Would the world care?”

     What Can Russia's War In Ukraine Mean For China And Taiwan?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As war breaks out in Ukraine, what has stood out in the backdrop of this crisis is the deepening Sino-Russian bonhomie.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave voice to what is on the minds of most strategic thinkers in the Western world – implications of a possible Russian invasion into Ukraine on the China-Taiwan tussle.
It is noteworthy that over the past few years, China has been deploying intimidation tactics against Taiwan by frequently breaching its airspace and waters, military drills, and other diplomatic manoeuvres.
Against these existing circumstances, if Western powers fail to hold Russia accountable for its actions in Ukraine, the scope for a Chinese invasion of Taiwan will definitely expand.
However, China isn’t Russia and Taiwan isn’t Ukraine.

     Taiwan Foreign Minister Calls US Help Critical to Deterring War with China
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “We want the people here in Taiwan to be able to defend themselves if China is going to launch a war against Taiwan,” Wu said.
Wu said China could have the potential to attack targets other than Taiwan in the future.
Wu said Taiwan must be “very careful” to not provoke China and trigger a conflict.
The most recent incident occurred in 1995 and 1996, when China fired missiles toward Taiwan ahead of its first democratic elections.
While the United States is not formally committed to defending Taiwan if it were attacked, under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act it has pledged to help it defend itself.
