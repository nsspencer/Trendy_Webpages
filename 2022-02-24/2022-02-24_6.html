     Why didn’t the U.S. cut off Russia from SWIFT? It’s complicated.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     President Biden said on Thursday that the United States and Europe were united in their efforts to confront Russian aggression toward Ukraine with aggressive sanctions.
However, there was one area where he suggested disagreement: SWIFT.
The Belgian messaging service, formally known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, connects more than 11,000 financial institutions around the world.
It is viewed as a potential nuclear option in the world of sanctions because, if Russia was kicked off SWIFT, the nation would essentially be severed from much of the global financial system.
SWIFT is a global cooperative of financial institutions that began in 1973 when 239 banks from 15 countries got together to figure out how to best handle cross-border payments.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     President Biden on Thursday announced a new round of sanctions against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine hours earlier.
But one move the president didn’t announce on Thursday was kicking Russia out of the SWIFT financial system, telling reporters that the penalties proposed are of “maybe more consequence than SWIFT.”Why would Russia be kicked out of the SWIFT banking system?
What is the SWIFT financial system?
How would a removal from SWIFT affect RussiaBarring Russia from SWIFT would damage the country’s economy right away and, in the long term, cut Russia off from a swath of international financial transactions.

     Russia faces expulsion from a key tool used in the global banking system
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Their call was echoed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is calling on the international community to help protect his country's sovereignty.
The ministers called on the international community to impose the "strongest possible sanctions on Russia, including disengaging Russia from SWIFT, isolating it politically" and supporting Ukraine.
SWIFT underpins the global financial system, handling millions of secure messages every day to help banks manage transactions around the world.
Cutting Russia off from the SWIFT messaging system is seen as the "nuclear option" because of the wide impact such a move would have, Vacroux said.
With Russia now attacking Ukraine in a full-scale invasion, Zelenskyy said on Thursday that Russia shouldn't be allowed to remain in the banking system.

     Russia-Ukraine: What is SWIFT and could it be used against Putin?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT could cripple its ability to trade with most of the world.
SWIFT is a network used by banks to send secure messages about transfers of money and other transactions.
More than 11,000 financial institutions in nearly 200 countries use SWIFT, making it the backbone of the international financial transfer system.
According to the Russian National SWIFT Association, Russia has the second-most users after the US, with some 300 Russian financial institutions belonging to the system.
“SWIFT is a European company, an association which involves a lot of countries,” Zhuravlev said.

     What is SWIFT banking system that could be used as sanction against Russia?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     "It is always an option," Biden told reporters at the White House, "but right now it's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take."
For the U.S. and its European allies, cutting Russia out of the SWIFT financial system would be one of the toughest financial steps they could take, damaging Russia's economy immediately and in the long term.
Allies on both sides of the Atlantic also dangled the SWIFT option in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.
The U.S. has succeeded before in persuading the SWIFT system to kick out a country — Iran, over its nuclear program.
But kicking Russia out of SWIFT would also hurt other economies, including those of the U.S. and a key ally, Germany.

     The West could still kick Russia out of SWIFT as the 'last resort'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ukraine appealed for Russia to be removed from SWIFT after President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion on Thursday.
US President Joe Biden told reporters on Thursday that depriving Russia of access to SWIFT is "always an option."
Germany, which relies on Russian gas to power the largest economy in Europe, is the most notable holdout.
"These are international organizations, and if not every country wants them to be thrown out of the SWIFT system, it becomes difficult," he told the BBC.
Senior Russian lawmakers have said that shipments of oil, gas and metals to Europe would stop.
