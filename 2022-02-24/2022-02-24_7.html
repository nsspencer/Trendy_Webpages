     Trump Praises Putin, Leaving Republicans in a Bind
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As Russia prepared to strike Ukraine and the United States rushed to defend neighboring allies in Europe, former President Donald J. Trump had nothing but admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
He is “pretty smart,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday at a Florida fund-raiser, assessing the impending invasion like a real estate deal.
“He’s taken over a country for $2 worth of sanctions,” he said, “taking over a country — really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people — and just walking right in.”Historians called the remarks unprecedented.
“The idea that a former president would praise the man or leadership who American troops are even now traveling to confront and contain,” said Jeffrey Engel, a presidential historian at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, “is astounding.”Yet Republican leaders, while condemning the invasion of Ukraine, stayed silent about the ex-president’s repeated praise this week for Mr. Putin, even as some Trump allies — from former administration figures to the Fox News host Tucker Carlson — amplified his Russian-friendly views to the party’s core.

     Where the Criminal and Civil Investigations Into Donald Trump Stand
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Manhattan Criminal CaseThe Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, has said that his office’s investigation is ongoing and that it will continue without the two prosecutors.
How it will proceed is unclear, though the investigation has already produced criminal charges against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg.
The office, then under Cyrus R. Vance Jr., also accused Mr. Weisselberg of avoiding taxes on $1.7 million in perks that should have been reported as income.
On Tuesday, lawyers for the company and for Mr. Weisselberg argued in court documents that those charges should be dismissed.
New York State Civil InquiryThe New York attorney general, Letitia James, had been working with Manhattan prosecutors on their criminal investigation.

     Bragg’s announcement Thursday follows the dramatic departure of Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz, whose resignations signaled a marked shift in the probe.
Bragg’s office has said the case, which he inherited from his predecessor, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. (D), is proceeding.
On Thursday, his spokesperson said it was “not true” that Bragg was unconcerned with advancing the matter.
AdvertisementDunne and Pomerantz believed Bragg would similarly seek an indictment, the people familiar with the situation said.
Hoffinger left her family’s law firm after many years doing defense work to work for Bragg.

     Why Does New York’s Criminal Investigation of Donald Trump Appear All But Over?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The criminal prosecution of Donald Trump in his home town appears to be all but officially over, at least for now.
His office then indicted both Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, and his former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, on tax charges.
The former President has denied the allegations, and accused the Manhattan D.A.’s office of conducting a political witch hunt.
A second grand jury was empanelled last November to hear the prosecutor’s developing case against Trump, and its term does not expire until April.
While Manhattan may be pulling the plug on prosecuting Trump’s business, the D.A.’s office in suburban Westchester County has opened a separate criminal investigation into his business activities there.

     An insider fears the Trump investigation in Manhattan has lost momentum after the 2 lead prosecutors resigned
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When the Manhattan DA's Trump probe began, eager prosecutors 'crowded' the grand jury room.
Now, probe insiders say the momentum is lost and, as one fears, 'Trump is not going to be charged.'
But now, the DA's three year investigation into alleged financial fraud at The Trump Organization appears to be losing steam.
The person acknowledged they were "making a guess that these two prosecutors think they have Trump dead to rights.
The crowd of prosecutors was there to "intimidate and influence" the grand jury, the filing alleged.
