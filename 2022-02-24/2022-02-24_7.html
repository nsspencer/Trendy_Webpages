     It was announced on Wednesday that the New York Knicks and Kemba Walker had come to an agreement that will see the former All-Star remain sidelined for the remainder of the season.
Rose also mentioned that Walker plans to “prepare for next season.”With that in mind, it’s highly likely that Walker ends up on a different team next year.
5 teams that should target Kemba Walker this summer: Charlotte HornetsThis one was too obvious to not be mentioned.
Kemba Walker spent the large majority of his career with the Charlotte Hornets, so it would make sense for them to bring him back.
That being said, the storyline of Walker heading back to Charlotte would be a heartwarming one.

     Knicks Star Reportedly Sitting Out For The Remainder Of The Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Update: The New York Knicks have confirmed the news with a statement from President Leon Rose.
According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Kemba Walker and the New York Knicks have agreed to have him sit out for the rest of the season.
The four-time All-Star played in 37 games for the Knicks this season, and has averages of 11.6 points, 3.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game.
Prior to this season, he had been on the Boston Celtics for each of the last two seasons.
After being traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder last off-season, he was bought out of his contract and then signed with the Knicks.

     Knicks’ Kemba Walker trade strategy following benching, revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kemba Walker’s homecoming to the New York Knicks has gone poorly for everyone.
Since the Knicks didn’t trade Walker or buy him out of his contract, questions arose on why the team chose this course.
According to SNY’s Ian Begley, New York is looking to trade Walker this offseason, where his trade value will be more solidified.
It’s worth noting that the Knicks didn’t aggressively pursue trades involving Walker ahead of the deadline.
New York decided Walker would have more trade value in the offseason, when he will be on an expiring contract.

     It’s been all or nothing for the Knicks’ version of Kemba Walker.
Now, it’s official: Walker’s first and maybe only season in New York will end with him stranded in the basketball wilderness.
The Knicks will shut down the point guard who signed a two-year deal with them this past summer for the rest of the season, the team announced Wednesday.
If he’s healthy, he’s good.
The Celtics cut ties with him at the end of last season because they lost faith in his medicals.
