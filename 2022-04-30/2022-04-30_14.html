     NFL Draft 2022: Day 3 Grades for Every Pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: T.J. Hockenson got selected in the top 10 of the 2019 draft because he was a legitimate "two-way" tight end as a blocker and receiving threat.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers add tight end depth just in case Rob Gronkowski doesn’t return to the team.
The two-time first-team All Big-12 selection has the necessary traits to be an effective three-down defensive tackle who can create havoc in opposing backfields.
The team already invested in defensive end Alex Wright during the third round.
The 6'5", 263-pound defensive end posted career highs last season with seven sacks, 11 tackles for loss and 46 pressures, per Ryan Fowler of The Draft Network.
