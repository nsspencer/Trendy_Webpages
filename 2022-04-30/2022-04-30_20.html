     Fire Erupts At Popular Red Jacket Resort In North Conway, NH
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NORTH CONWAY, N.H. (CBS) — A massive fire broke out Saturday afternoon at Red Jacket Mountain View Resort, a popular hotel in North Conway, New Hampshire.
The fire started on the third floor in the south wing of the resort a little before 3 p.m.
“At this time, there have been no reports of unaccounted for guests, and those who were staying at the Red Jacket have been offered hospitality at another nearby resort,” the State Fire Marshal said.
The resort is a family retreat in New Hampshire’s White Mountains and is home to Kahuna Laguna, an indoor water park.
“It’s pretty incredible based on how many people are in the building, and to have only three injuries is pretty significant,” said witness Josiah Huchins.
