     Steelers draft Connor Heyward, brother of Cam Heyward, marking fourth pair of brothers on team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pittsburgh Steelers are a family affair and on Day Three of the 2022 NFL Draft the team added yet another pair of brothers to their squad.
The Steelers already had three sets of siblings, but with the addition of defensive tackle Cameron Heyward's brother, tight end/fullback Connor Heyward, they are now at four sets of brothers.
Before Connor was selected by Pittsburgh, Cam discussed what it would mean if his team chose his brother.
Those two sets of brothers also have a third brother in the NFL, just on a separate team.
The fourth set of brothers on the Steelers is defensive tackles Carlos Davis and Khalil Davis.
