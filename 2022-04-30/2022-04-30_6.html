The Steelers started off their draft by picking Kenny Pickett, George Pickens, and DeMarvin Leal.
Quarterback and wide receiver were arguably the two biggest needs entering the draft and they were taken care of with the first two picks.
Pittsburgh seemed to be telling us a few things with their first few draft picks.
I’m pretty comfortable with what the Steelers have done through the first two days of the NFL Draft.

     Summary: The Pittsburgh Steelers are a family affair and on Day Three of the 2022 NFL Draft the team added yet another pair of brothers to their squad.
The Steelers already had three sets of siblings, but with the addition of defensive tackle Cameron Heyward's brother, tight end/fullback Connor Heyward, they are now at four sets of brothers.
Before Connor was selected by Pittsburgh, Cam discussed what it would mean if his team chose his brother.
Those two sets of brothers also have a third brother in the NFL, just on a separate team.
The fourth set of brothers on the Steelers is defensive tackles Carlos Davis and Khalil Davis.

     Steelers draft Cameron Heyward’s brother, Connor, a Michigan State tight end
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With their sixth-round pick, the Steelers made it four sets of brothers on their roster by taking Michigan State tight end Connor Heyward with the 208th overall pick.
His role evolved to the point he is considered an H-back or fullback-type tight end who can be a special-teamer and versatile chess piece on offense.
Steelers tight end coach Alfredo Roberts said he views Heyward as a tight end but added that his versatility would be utilized.
The addition of Connor Heyward could make Watt expendable, especially in light of the $4.7 million salary-cap hit he’s due.
The consensus among the scouting community is that Connor Heyward doesn’t have high-end athleticism but has a defined floor as, at worst, a core special-teams player.
