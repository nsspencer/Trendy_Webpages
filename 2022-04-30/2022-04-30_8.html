     Jokes, Glamour and a Try for Normalcy as Correspondents’ Dinner Returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, opted against going to the dinner because of the obvious danger.
Organizers required all guests to be vaccinated, boosted and test negative before attending, although few wore masks besides the serving staff.
As a concession to the potential peril, Mr. Biden, who at 79 is in a high-risk age group, skipped the dinner and came only for the speaking portion of the evening.
But his presence was meant to represent a return to normalcy after Mr. Trump’s war on the news media.
“The free press is not the enemy of the people,” Mr. Biden said.

The event was cancelled during the pandemic, and former president Donald Trump shunned the event while he was in office.
The president joked about criticism he has faced in his first 15 months in power, and the press, the opposition, and Trump.
"Just imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year" the president said.
He also made light of the "Let's Go Brandon" slogan, which is used by opposition to swear at the president.

     White House correspondents’ dinner: Biden jokes about return to near-normal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadWashington’s media and political elite partied like it was 2019 on Saturday at the annual White House correspondents’ dinner, the traditionally glitzy spring gala that staggered back to life after a pandemic-induced two-year hiatus.
There were even a healthy cohort of actual White House correspondents in attendance; the journalist contingent in the room is often diluted by the number of corporate suits and high-ranking pols who score seats at tables bought by media organizations.
The White House Correspondents’ Association decided to forge ahead anyway, instituting a double requirement of vaccinations and testing on guests.
He then held a mock news conference featuring actual White House reporters.
Dunnigan, of the Associated Negro Press, and Payne, who worked for the Chicago Defender, were the first African American women to become White House correspondents in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

     Trevor Noah Brings Clapter, Impressions to White House Correspondents’ Dinner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: AFP via Getty ImagesTrevor Noah headlined the first White House Correspondents’ Dinner in six years on Saturday night, with a set that elicited some groans and much clapter from the packed room.
Noah, though he did perfectly well with a difficult gig, didn’t land the biggest laugh of the night.
That honor went to POTUS, for one unexpectedly pointed joke.
“Everyone had to prove they are fully vaccinated and boosted,” Biden said during his remarks.
“So, if you are at home watching this, and you are wondering how to do that, just contact your favorite Fox News reporter.
