     Sixers Rookie Charles Bassey Gets Healthy After Joel Embiid Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Sixers held a quiet competition behind Joel Embiid throughout the final stretch of the 2021-2022 regular season, Doc Rivers favored the veterans DeAndre Jordan and Paul Millsap.
Jordan and Millsap's struggles eventually gave Rivers incentive to try out the second-year power forward Paul Reed as a small-ball five.
Rivers could roll with Jordan, Millsap, or Reed, but the rookie center Charles Bassey is also now an option as he's getting healthier.
During the final week of the regular season, Bassey suffered a shoulder injury while spending time with Philly's G League affiliate, the Delaware Blue Coats.
The chances of Rivers going to Bassey before Jordan, Millsap, or Reed in the second round against the Miami Heat are slim.

     Summary: CAMDEN, N.J.–The Philadelphia 76ers are in a tough spot as they prepare for the Miami Heat for Game 1 of the Eastern semifinals without their superstar big man in Joel Embiid.
The big fella suffered an orbital fracture and a concussion in the team’s Game 6 win over the Toronto Raptors.
The Sixers will now have a huge challenge as they prepare for this next series without their best player.
Philadelphia will be in trouble if other guys don’t step up on the offensive end in this series and as they get set to head down to Miami on Monday, they will have to figure out just how they replace him.

     Miami Heat: Kyle Lowry injury could loom large vs. Philadelphia 76ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As all the attention surrounds Joel Embiid’s injury, the Miami Heat are also dealing with an injury that could loom large in the series.
The Philadelphia 76ers are slated to begin their Eastern Conference semifinals series against the Miami Heat without Joel Embiid, but the Miami Heat are also dealing with a big injury that could greatly impact the series.
The loss of Kyle Lowry, who is dealing with a hamstring injury, could loom large for the Heat against the Sixers.
Knowing how the Heat operates, they’ll probably try to buy some more time as Lowry continues to recover.
Perhaps the winner of this series will be determined by which team gets their star back first, Lowry or Embiid.

     Summary: Game 6 between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Toronto Raptors got rowdy this past Thursday night.
With four minutes left in the game on Thursday, Embiid threw down a big dunk.
Seconds later, Raptors big man Pascal Siakam drove to the basket and ended up elbowing Embiid to the face as he collected an And-1.
But following Toronto's Game 6 loss, which eliminated them from the playoffs, Siakam mentioned he doesn't have any issues with the way Embiid celebrated.
Although Embiid joked that he thought Siakam might've broken his face on the play after the game, that turned out actually to be the case.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Therefore, Embiid intended to continue playing through the injury and would get surgery on his thumb in the offseason.
While the thumb injury certainly wasn't ideal, it wasn't the end of the world for the Sixers' playoff run.
This isn't Embiid's first rodeo with an orbital injury.
According to NBC Sports Philadelphia's John Clark, surgery is likely not required for Embiid's injury.
If Embiid were to undergo surgery, there was a good chance he would miss the entire second-round series against Miami.

Philadelphia 76ers injury reportThe Sixers went from looking to be in good shape to losing their best player for potentially the entire series.
With Embiid potentially out for a few games, it’ll be up to veterans like Paul Millsap and DeAndre Jordan to provide decent minutes.
He’s not expected to be part of coach Doc Rivers’ rotation throughout the playoffs, but Embiid’s injury could potentially open the door to playing time.

After practicing Saturday, the Sixers faced plenty of questions related to one big topic: How will the team replace Joel Embiid, who's out indefinitely after suffering a right orbital fracture and mild concussion during the Sixers' Game 6, series-clinching win over the Raptors?
... (The Heat) shoot free throws well, so we don't want to play the whole series in the penalty.
"I thought Paul was terrific," Rivers said.
Rivers noted the Sixers expect Harris will spend time guarding Lowry, Butler and Adebayo this series.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia's Joel Embiid is out indefinitely with an injury, and the Sixers’ MVP finalist had no business sustaining the injury in the first place.
Sixers coach Doc Rivers can defend his three series losses when his teams had a 3-1 lead.
He can’t defend Embiid being on the court the Sixers ahead 119-90 with 3:58 remaining in the fourth quarter.
During the regular season, the Sixers scored 115.6 points and allowed 107.8 points per 100 possessions with Embiid on the court.
And the situation was avoidable, too, had Rivers not had his MVP on the court in a blowout with more important games ahead.

     Summary: Alex Perez (right) and Ken Cockerill were frustrated that Sixers coach Doc Rivers kept Joel Embiid in the game so long, especially given the team's double-digit lead.
The Sixers won, but at a great cost: Embiid, on pace to be the league MVP, has been sidelined indefinitely by team doctors.
“Part of me wonders how much of that decision to keep him in was Joel,” Geftman said.
Embiid’s injury was the absolute lowest point for the Sixers, even eclipsing the drama over Ben Simmons and his eventual trade, according to Daniel Ott.

     Summary: Well: With Joel Embiid dealing with an uncertain status due to an orbital fracture and mild concussion, the chances of repeat disappointment are high for Philly.
So what would this new reality look like without Embiid, possibly the most physically dominant player in basketball?
It’s Bam Adebayo time: The talented big man can, and probably should, swing this series squarely in Miami’s favor with Embiid out.
— John SchuhmannThe pickThe series will begin with a feeling of deflation with Embiid potentially out, and he’ll take the suspense with him.
The shame is Embiid would’ve been the best player in the series by a sizable margin.
