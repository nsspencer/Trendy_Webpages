     Jets close draft’s 3rd round with pick of childhood Jets fan Jeremy Ruckert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeremy Ruckert becomes the third tight end the New York Jets added this offseasonFrom the shores of Babylon to the turf of East Rutherford, Jeremy Ruckert is once again on pace to make a gridiron defense in tri-state area football.
With the 101st pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the New York Jets went into the weekend with another tight end in their arsenal, welcoming in Ohio State’s Jeremy Ruckert in the late stages of the third round.
He’s also the third tight end the Jets have added this offseason, joining veteran free agents C.J.
The team ranked 20th in red zone touchdown percentage last season and no New York tight has scored more than five touchdowns since Johnny Mitchell in 1993.
The official Twitter account of the Ohio State football team shared this photo of a young Ruckert donning Jets gear.

     'It's a dream come true.' Ohio State tight end Jeremy Ruckert drafted by hometown Jets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ohio State tight end Jeremy Ruckert grew up a Jets fan in Lindenhurst, New York.
"Once that phone rang, you could hear a pin drop," Ruckert said in a video interview with a Jets team reporter.
But he knew tight end would be his eventual position, and he was determined to be a complete one, not just a pass-catcher.
Ruckert signed with Ohio State four years ago understanding that Buckeye tight ends don't put up gaudy receiving numbers.

     What Ohio State TE Jeremy Ruckert Brings to the Jets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Jets didn't necessarily need to pick a tight end in this year's draft after addressing the position by signing two veterans in free agency.
Nonetheless, when Jets general manager Joe Douglas found himself on the clock in the third round on Friday night, he elected to take Ohio State's Jeremy Ruckert with the 101st selection of the 2022 NFL Draft.
Uzomah and Tyler Conklin in New York's tight end room, Ruckert will have a chance to grow over time, not needing to be a superstar right away.
"He’s an absolute bulldog in the run game," Jets head coach Robert Saleh added.
"My whole family grew up as Jets fans going to practices at Hofstra and going to games as a kid.
