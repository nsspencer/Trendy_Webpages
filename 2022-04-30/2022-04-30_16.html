     Pitt’s Jordan Addison may transfer to USC for hefty NIL deal amid tampering claims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: College sports are becoming the wild, wild west as players can now make money off their name, are allowed to transfer without sitting out, and more and more agents are getting into the mix.
Lincoln Riley APAccording to ESPN, Pittsburgh star wideout Jordan Addison, the Biletnikoff Award winner as the country’s top wide receiver in 2021, is contemplating entering his name into the transfer portal before Sunday’s May 1 deadline.
It should be noted that other reports have said Addison would be cashing in on a big NIL if he does wind up at USC.
Addison had 100 receptions for 1,593 yards and 17 touchdowns a year ago, and would help transform USC under Riley, who has already brought in 15 transfers.
That has included his former quarterback at Oklahoma, Caleb Williams, a Washington, D.C. native like Addison.

     Rumors explode as USC is linked to elite Pitt wide receiver Jordan Addison
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Day 2 of the NFL draft unfolded on Friday evening, an explosive story developed in college football, with USC and Lincoln Riley at the center of it.
According to ESPN’s Pete Thamel, Pittsburgh head coach contacted Lincoln Riley to express his displeasure and disapproval with this rumored series of events.
Addison, who just completed his sophomore season, has yet to enter the NCAA transfer portal.
Pittsburgh thinks that USC and Riley are tampering with Addison in trying to steer him to Los Angeles.
Today is April 30, so if Addison is going to enter the portal, it will need to happen today.

     Ludwig: Jordan Addison’s Exit Points Toward Ugly Future of College Football
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Is a freshman who hasn’t played a down of college football earning $1 million a surprising instance?
USC, led by Lincoln Riley, has led an assault on opposing college programs, and if this is the future of college football then Pitt — and every other non-blue blood — is screwed.
You can spin it any way you want, but USC swayed a Pitt student-athlete with the promises of financial opportunity.
But, unfortunately, that may be the new norm of college football is swift action isn’t taken to prevent instances like this.
And if this is only the beginning for Pitt, well, college football is headed down a dark path toward the same four schools competing for anything.
