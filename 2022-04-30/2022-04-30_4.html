     Katie Taylor defeats Amanda Serrano via split decision in history-making classic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — Katie Taylor retained her undisputed lightweight championship of the world, and cemented herself as a sporting legend in the process, with a split decision win over Amanda Serrano in the first women's boxing bout to headline Madison Square Garden in its 140-year history.
However she was pinned down in the fifth round and subjected to brutal sustained Serrano offense.
Winning co-promoter Eddie Hearn stated in the ring post-fight that he wants to give Taylor a homecoming bout in Ireland.
And off the back of this incredible contest between the two top pound-for-pound best women's fighters on the planet, a rematch in an Irish stadium would be a red-hot ticket.

     Katie Taylor defeats Amanda Serrano in first boxing match headlined by two women at Madison Square Garden
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Ireland's Katie Taylor defeated Puerto Rico's Amanda Serrano Saturday night in the first boxing match headlined by two women at New York's Madison Square Garden.
Taylor, who won a gold medal in the 2012 Olympics, stays undefeated and improves her career record to 21-0 and six knockouts.
The 35-year-old won via a split decision in front of a capacity crowd at the Garden, successfully defending her women's lightweight titles in the WBA, IBF, WBO and WBC.
The bout ended in spectacular fashion as both fighters, visibly exhausted, desperately tried to land their final punches.
It was Taylor, bloodied and unsteady on her feet after taking heavy shots from Serrano in the fifth round, who was declared the winner.
