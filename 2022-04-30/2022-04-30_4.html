     Summary: Steve Nicol feels Gabriel Jesus' sky high confidence is seeing him hit his best form ever for the club.
(0:58)Why Gabriel Jesus is performing better than ever for Man City (0:58)Pep Guardiola says Manchester City won't crack under the pressure of their relentless title race with Liverpool.
City moved back to the top of the table with a 4-0 win over Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday just hours after Liverpool had won 1-0 at Newcastle United.
They play before, they are going to win all games.

     Liverpool Rest Stars And Deliver Crucial Win Against Newcastle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In fact, it was the first time this Premier League season that Klopp fielded a team without one of Fabinho, Thiago, Alexander-Arnold, or Salah in the starting XI.
Liverpool then held on to their one-goal lead for the remainder of the game, with the Magpies doing little to trouble Allison.
A crucial second leg match against Villareal in the Champions League semi-final on Tuesday night awaits, where Liverpool are up 2-0 after the first leg win.
Liverpool throughout this season have proven they can win games by narrow margins even when not playing at their best, and in this case, even when not fielding the strongest possible lineup.
In fact, since January 2, the only result that has harmed Liverpool in any way was the 2-2 draw at Manchester City.

     Man City, Liverpool win in EPL title race; Norwich relegated
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APLONDON (AP) — It’s still advantage Manchester City in the English Premier League title race after the league leader and Liverpool won tricky away matches at in-form teams on Saturday.
First up was Liverpool, which won at Newcastle 1-0 despite resting several players, and was briefly atop the table.
I don’t know if it is important — but it is in our hands,” City coach Pep Guardiola said.
With that in mind, Liverpool coach Jürgen Klopp rested Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara and Mohamed Salah from the starting lineup.
Newcastle had been bidding for a fifth straight win — and a seventh straight victory at home — but struggled to escape Liverpool's press.

     Summary: The win continued a relentless run of form that has dragged Liverpool back into the title race.
Klopp’s men have picked up 40 points from the last 42 on offer, only dropping points away to City.
Newcastle, looking for their fifth-straight league win, never gave in, but could not break through a near-impenetrable Liverpool rearguard.
Late goals from Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill earned the visitors their first come-from-behind away win in the Premier League.
Norwich, however, limped out of the Premier League with a whimper following a goal and assist by Villa substitute Danny Ings.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Klopp's team to win a second title in three seasons, they need City to slip up somewhere.
Under Eddie Howe, Newcastle have been revitalised since the turn of the year and only Liverpool have a better Premier League record since Jan. 1.
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp still has his side fighting on three fronts having already won one trophy this season.
Milner left Newcastle in 2008, but his professionalism and contribution in a black-and-white shirt all those years ago continues to be remembered.
If they can't pip City in the Premier League, it won't be down to a lack of effort, quality or persistence.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At which, enter two exhibits, the two captains at St James’ Park: Newcastle’s Jonjo Shelvey and Jordan Henderson of Liverpool.
They arrived at Anfield a year apart, Shelvey as a highly rated 18-year-old who had already amassed 42 league games for Charlton, Henderson as a 20-year-old worth £16m.
Henderson was a trier who, as Alex Ferguson noted, had a slightly odd way of running.
There was a moment early in the second half when a loose ball spun between the two captains.
Perhaps Shelvey has been the more graceful player through his career, perhaps he is in that sense the more talented.

This season has seen brilliant additions to Jurgen Klopp’s squad in Ibrahima Konate and Luis Diaz.
The rise of Harvey Elliot has also been brilliant to watch, as Liverpool are starting to look set for the next few years.
Trent Alexander-Arnold is key to the way Liverpool play and when missing it is highly noticeable with centre-back Joe Gomez having to cover.
Liverpool have been looking to sign Aberdeen youngster Calvin Ramsay to be the full-time plan B behind Trent.

     How Liverpool overcame Newcastle and climbed back to top of Premier League: Live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool maintained their assault on the top of the Premier League as they defeated Newcastle 1-0 in a tightly-contested affair at St. James' Park.
The Reds' manager Jurgen Klopp made five changes to the side that overcame Villarreal midweek, with both Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah dropped to the bench.
It was the hosts who made a brighter start to the game as they forced Liverpool into a number of early mistakes with their relentless press.
But the Reds took the lead when Naby Keita danced into the Newcastle penalty area and rounded keeper Martin Dubravka before firing into an empty net.
After a nervy end, Liverpool were able to hold on and seal the win to move two points above Manchester City - who face Leeds at Elland Road this evening.
