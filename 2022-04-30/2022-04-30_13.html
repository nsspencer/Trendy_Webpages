     Summary: It was a tale of two set-pieces at Elland Road as Manchester City kept themselves top of the Premier League with three precious points with a 4-0 win over Leeds United on Saturday evening.
Wasted a late chance, not that it matters too much, and then got a great late block in.
Ruben Dias - 7 Twitter: if2is Used his physicality wonderfully to head it down for Ake and create the second goal.
Nathan Ake - 8Another great performance at left-back, capped off when he bundled in the second goal with the game at a crucial junction.
Fernandinho - 7Scored a fantastic goal, and potentially his last ever for City - what a way to sign off if so!
