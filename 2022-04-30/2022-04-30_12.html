     Eagles Signing Nevada QB Carson Strong
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kirsten Morzan reports that the Eagles have signed Nevada QB Carson Strong to a contract after he went undrafted.
Strong, 22, finished his senior season at Nevada but opted to forego his final year of eligibility and enter this year’s draft.
He may not be as well known as some of the other quarterbacks in this class, but Strong could end up being a mid-round pick when all is said and done.
Lance Zierlien compares him to former QB Drew Bledsoe.
During his four-year college career, Strong completed 68.1 percent of his pass attempts for 9,379 yards (7.5 YPA), 74 touchdowns, and 19 interceptions in 32 career games.

     Report: Eagles sign undrafted free agent Nevada QB Carson Strong
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Undrafted Nevada quarterback Carson Strong has signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, according to a report from Kristen Moran of Nevada Sports Net.
Prior to the start of fall camp this month, Strong has an arthroscopy to clear out scar tissue in the knee.
Strong was a full participant in Nevada's first fall camp practice Aug. 6, although his knee was bleeding heavily after the session.
Strong has since had to have the knee drained a couple of times and has been limited to watching practice from a golf cart in recent sessions.

     Summary: The Philadelphia Eagles went through the 2022 NFL Draft without selecting a quarterback.
Philadelphia signed Nevada quarterback Carson Strong as an undrafted free agent, per Nevada SportsNet.
Strong was one of the top passers in the FBS over the last three seasons, ranking first in completions (852), fourth in pass yards (9,368), and second in pass touchdowns (74).
Strong was seventh in the FBS in completion rate (70%), fifth in pass yards per game (347.9), and tied for seventh in pass touchdowns (36) in 2021.
In a lackluster quarterback class where just one quarterback went in the first 73 picks, Strong went undrafted due to a history of knee issues.

     Eagles sign Nevada QB Carson Strong to an undrafted free agent deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: JUST IN: Quarterback Carson Strong has signed with the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent — Kirsten Moran (@kirstenlizmoran) April 30, 2022The Eagles add a quarterback to the roster anytime potential is noticed and after going undrafted, former Nevada star Carson Strong is signing an undrafted free agent deal with Philadelphia.
Strong previously met with the Eagles at the Senior Bowl and he offers a big-time throwing arm with solid intangibles.
Strong fits the mold when it comes to quarterbacks, standing 6’4 215 pounds, the former Nevada signal-caller has the best arm in the draft, he’s among the most accurate passers in the draft, can throw his wide receivers open, while also making sound decisions in the passing game.
Strong threw for 4,175 yards and 36 touchdowns in 2021 and definitely could have a future down the line as a development quarterback.

The waiting continued for Strong and the rest of the Solano County, but it didn’t happen until after the draft was over.
I am going to give them my blood, sweat, and tears.”Look for more on Strong in The Reporter in the coming days.
On Saturday’s final rounds of the draft, running backs and kickers were more of a focus than quarterbacks on Day 3.
Indeed, two punters and a placekicker went as the final day of selections began before any more quarterbacks were taken.
