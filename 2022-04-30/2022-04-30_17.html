     Summary: There is a cottage industry on Wall Street predicting what would Warren buy.
That, of course, refers to Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK.B) Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history.
This year, amid stormy investing seas, Buffett seems to be focusing on shareholder yield.
Other investors might want to pay attention to that value-investing metric.

     Berkshire Hathaway Reports Drop in Earnings, Driven by Investment Losses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Berkshire Hathaway, the insurance and investing conglomerate that is run by the billionaire and investment legend Warren E. Buffett, reported on Saturday a significant drop in earnings in the first quarter.
That was down 53 percent from the nearly $12 billion that it earned in the same three months a year ago.
Those profits were also lower than the $6 billion that analysts had expected the company would earn in the quarter.
Much of the drop, though, was driven by Berkshire’s large stock portfolio, which lost nearly $1.6 billion in the first three months of the year, down from a gain of nearly $5 billion in the first quarter of 2021.
The earnings report came out as the company was holding its annual meeting in person for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic.

     Berkshire Hathaway shareholders vote to keep Warren Buffett as chair
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders on Saturday rejected proposals to have an independent chair replace Warren Buffett, and require his company to disclose more about its climate-related risks and efforts to improve diversity.
Shareholders supported letting Buffett keep both the chairman and chief executive roles by a nearly 6-to-1 margin, Berkshire said at its annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.
The National Legal and Policy Center, a Berkshire shareholder, had said it was poor corporate governance for the legendary investor to retain both roles.
Buffett’s oldest son, Howard Buffett, a Berkshire director, is expected to become non-executive chair when his father is no longer in charge.
By approximately 3-to-1 margins shareholders also rejected proposals to have the company disclose more about the climate-related risks, greenhouse gas emissions and diversity efforts in its dozens of businesses.

Berkshire Hathaway shareholders walk by a video screen at the company’s annual meeting in Omaha on May 4, 2013.
In March the company purchased insurance giant Alleghany for $11.6 billion.
The company meeting, often billed as “Woodstock for capitalists,” has long been an iconic day-long affair, where Buffet fields questions in a 17,000-seat arena.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Berkshire revealed in its earnings report Saturday morning that its mountain of cash shrank to $106 billion in the first quarter from $147 billion at the beginning of the year as Buffett invested $51 billion in stocks and repurchased $3.2 billion of its own shares.
Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said that with the Chevron and Occidental investments combined Berkshire now has more than $40 billion invested in the oil sector.
Buffett says that Berkshire's operating earnings are a better measure of the company's performance because they exclude investment gains and losses.
In addition to investments, Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 90 business outright, including BNSF railroad, several major utilities, Geico insurance and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies.
Dalton said she misses the more detailed business answers that Buffett used to give at the earlier meetings she attended.
