     Ukrainian military confirms ‘The Ghost of Kyiv’ is made up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The viral tale of the so-called “Ghost of Kyiv” — a lone Ukrainian ace fighter pilot credited with at least six kills in the skies, with some claims putting the number up to 40 — has been officially denounced by the Ukrainian military after a pilot who died in March was identified as the Ghost by multiple media outlets, including The Times of London.
The Ukrainian military denied those claims.
“The ghost of Kyiv is a superhero legend who was created by the Ukrainians!
However, officials and family members who spoke with NPR’s Eric Westervelt made no mention of the Ghost of Kyiv or claimed he was Tarabalka.
This past week NATO pilots scrambled several times to intercept Russian jets flying over the Black and Baltic seas.

     ‘Stop Spreading Fake News: The Ghost Of Kyiv Is A Legend’, Ukrainian Military Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some claims about the “Ghost of Kyiv” that went viral lately and other recent “urban legends” were just officially debunked.
13, 2022, was the legendary “Ghost of Kyiv”, a fighter pilot who shot down “more than 40 Russian aircraft”.
The Spanish newspaper Marca was among the first to claim that the Ghost of Kyiv had downed the six aircraft.
Former Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, posted on Twitter a photo of a fighter pilot, claiming it to be the real Ghost of Kyiv.
In the end, even the official Ukrainian accounts have had to post an official statement to respond to such reports that could probably damage the reputation and credibility of Kyiv’s military along with its past and future claims.
