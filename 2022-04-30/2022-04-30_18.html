     New York Giants GM casts doubt on Kadarius Toney trade after spending Day 2 pick on Wan’Dale Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Danielle Parhizkaran/NorthJersey.com / USA TODAY NETWORKDays before the 2022 NFL Draft, reports surfaced that the New York Giants were exploring Kadarius Toney trade scenarios just a year after selecting him with the 20th pick.
When New York spent the 43rd overall selection this year on receiver Wan’Dale Robinson, a trade felt inevitable.
On a team that already has Kenny Golladay, Sterling Shepard, Darius Slayton and Toney, the pick made a trade seem imminent.
With plenty of receivers available on Day 2, no NFL team was willing to trade a second-round pick for Toney given what transpired last year.
If any other incidents occur, though, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the Giants trade him quickly.

     2022 NFL Draft: Wan'Dale Robinson says move from Nebraska to Kentucky a reason he was second-round pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Giants selected Kentucky and ex-Nebraska wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft with the No.
Robinson transferred from the Huskers to Kentucky ahead of the 2021 season, something he says had a big impact on where he went in the draft.
He was also used as a running back, totaling 134 carries for 580 yards (4.3 yards per rush) and four touchdowns.
In his lone season in Lexington, Robinson caught 104 passes for 1,334 yards (12.8 yards per catch) and seven touchdowns.
“At the end of the day I just felt all of that was because of my size,” Robinson said.

     Giants make 2 trades, take Kentucky's Wan'Dale Robinson in 2nd round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Wan’Dale Robinson has been told for most of his football career that he isn’t tall enough.
Robinson on Friday found an NFL team that agreed with him when the New York Giants surprised many by taking the 5-foot-8 Kentucky wide receiver in the second round of the NFL draft.
Schoen said the Giants had a deal in place before the start of the second round and quickly made another one, dropping a total of seven places in the round before grabbing Robinson, who was with family and friends in a hotel in Lexington, Kentucky.
New York also continued to search for help across the board in the third round, taking North Carolina lineman Joshua Ezeudu and LSU defensive back Cordale Flott.
Giants coach Brian Daboll said Robinson can play in the slot and outside.

The selection was a bit of a surprise to experts as Robinson was widely considered a Day 3 pick, not a second rounder.
So, I didn’t get to see him in person but I know who he is,” Robinson said of Toney.
General manager Joe Schoen insists the Giants are not dealing Toney, so Robinson isn’t here to replace him but to supplement him.
Robinson plans to do whatever the Giants need him to do once he gets to New Jersey.
