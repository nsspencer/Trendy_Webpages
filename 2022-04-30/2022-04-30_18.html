     49ers' Brock Purdy: Nabbed by San Fran with last pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 49ers selected Purdy in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft, 262nd overall.
Irrelevant in this draft class as the former Iowa State quarterback heads to the Bay Area.
Purdy had some hype as a potential early round selection after a strong start to his career with the Cyclones, highlighted by him throwing 27 touchdowns as a sophomore.
Purdy didn't improve as an upperclassman, however, and his stock slid as a result.
While he lacks starter-level traits for an NFL quarterback, Purdy could become a solid backup down the line.

     49ers Make Brock Purdy "Mr. Irrelevant"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 262 -- the 49ers took Iowa State quarterback Brock Purdy.
Purdy almost certainly won't make the 49ers' 53-man roster, because the 49ers already have a backup quarterback -- Nate Sudfeld.
After the draft, head coach Kyle Shanahan compared Purdy to former 49ers backup quarterback Nick Mullens, because they're both physically limited quarterbacks who play well from the pocket.
Purdy reminds me of another former 49ers backup quarterback -- C.J.
Because if Lance gets injured and misses time, the 49ers will have to abandon their Trey Lance offense and do something else.

     49ers make Iowa St. QB Brock Purdy Mr. Irrelevant, draft him with 262nd pick

     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers ended the 2022 NFL Draft by selecting Iowa State quarterback Brock Purdy with the 262nd overall selection.
Purdy becomes the latest Mr.
Purdy was a four-year starter for the Cyclones, generating some draft buzz in 2018 and 2019, but he ultimately plateaued over his final two college seasons.
In 13 games, he completed 65.7% of his passes for 3,982 yards and 27 touchdowns while throwing just nine interceptions.
The further the ball gets outside of the numbers or down the field; Purdy has less velocity.

     Summary: Ever since what transpired on that October, 2018 afternoon in Stillwater, Oklahoma — everyone knew Brock Purdy was destined for Iowa State greatness.
