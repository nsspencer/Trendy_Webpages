     Summary: The final day of the 2022 NFL Draft is here, and the Detroit Lions still have three picks remaining.
With a heavy emphasis on defense, as expected, the rest of the Lions draft could go in any number of directions.
Instead, Lions fans will have to wait until pick 177—their compensatory pick for Jarrad Davis—for Detroit to be on the clock.
Here’s an estimate of the times for the Lions’ three remaining picks:Round 5, Pick 177 — Approximately 3:24 p.m.

     Summary: Washington is all but stable at the QB position and could use some competition for the backup job at the very least.
After a promising 2020 campaign, Howell's game showed minimal development last season and was unable to improve his draft stock.
However, in the fifth round, the Commanders are getting excellent value in a low-risk, high-reward playmaker.
Howell has NFL starter arm talent and toughness, which could give him an edge as he competes for the QB2 job in camp.
