     Summary: Brock Purdy is going to NFL.
The record-breaking Iowa State quarterback was the final pick of the seventh and final round of the NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers.
He’s the first Cyclones quarterback drafted since Seneca Wallace went to the Seattle Seahawks in the fourth round of the 2003 draft.
“I want to go some place where I can develop and get ready for the NFL," Purdy told The Des Moines Register while sitting in an airport after his recruiting visit to Alabama in 2018.

     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers ended the 2022 NFL Draft by selecting Iowa State quarterback Brock Purdy with the 262nd overall selection.
Purdy becomes the latest Mr.
Purdy was a four-year starter for the Cyclones, generating some draft buzz in 2018 and 2019, but he ultimately plateaued over his final two college seasons.
In 13 games, he completed 65.7% of his passes for 3,982 yards and 27 touchdowns while throwing just nine interceptions.
The further the ball gets outside of the numbers or down the field; Purdy has less velocity.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 262 -- the 49ers took Iowa State quarterback Brock Purdy.
Purdy almost certainly won't make the 49ers' 53-man roster, because the 49ers already have a backup quarterback -- Nate Sudfeld.
After the draft, head coach Kyle Shanahan compared Purdy to former 49ers backup quarterback Nick Mullens, because they're both physically limited quarterbacks who play well from the pocket.
Purdy reminds me of another former 49ers backup quarterback -- C.J.
Because if Lance gets injured and misses time, the 49ers will have to abandon their Trey Lance offense and do something else.
