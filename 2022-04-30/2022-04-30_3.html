     Report: Liverpool Suffer Huge Setback, Throwing Jurgen Klopp’s Plans Up In The Air
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the season is coming to end, Jurgen Klopp’s squad depth will become vital, as Liverpool continue on their journey to a historic quadruple.
This season has seen brilliant additions to Jurgen Klopp’s squad in Ibrahima Konate and Luis Diaz.
The rise of Harvey Elliot has also been brilliant to watch, as Liverpool are starting to look set for the next few years.
Trent Alexander-Arnold is key to the way Liverpool play and when missing it is highly noticeable with centre-back Joe Gomez having to cover.
Liverpool have been looking to sign Aberdeen youngster Calvin Ramsay to be the full-time plan B behind Trent.

     Liverpool keep pressure on Man City with 1-0 win at Newcastle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEWCASTLE, England, April 30 (Reuters) - A first-half strike from midfielder Naby Keita helped Liverpool secure a hard-earned 1-0 win at Newcastle United on Saturday as Juergen Klopp's side kept their Premier League title hopes alive and provisionally went top of the table.
The victory put Liverpool two points ahead of champions Manchester City, who can regain first spot with a win at Leeds United later on Saturday.
"Coming here with five changes and building pretty much a new setup is really difficult, so the performance was absolutely outstanding.
It's really difficult to get a feeling for the game."
It is difficult to do it consistently against Liverpool... we were much more aggressive in the second half but did not have any concerted pressure in the game," he said.

     Liverpool Rest Stars And Deliver Crucial Win Against Newcastle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In fact, it was the first time this Premier League season that Klopp fielded a team without one of Fabinho, Thiago, Alexander-Arnold, or Salah in the starting XI.
Liverpool then held on to their one-goal lead for the remainder of the game, with the Magpies doing little to trouble Allison.
A crucial second leg match against Villareal in the Champions League semi-final on Tuesday night awaits, where Liverpool are up 2-0 after the first leg win.
Liverpool throughout this season have proven they can win games by narrow margins even when not playing at their best, and in this case, even when not fielding the strongest possible lineup.
In fact, since January 2, the only result that has harmed Liverpool in any way was the 2-2 draw at Manchester City.

     Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson wins captains’ duel with Jonjo Shelvey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At which, enter two exhibits, the two captains at St James’ Park: Newcastle’s Jonjo Shelvey and Jordan Henderson of Liverpool.
They arrived at Anfield a year apart, Shelvey as a highly rated 18-year-old who had already amassed 42 league games for Charlton, Henderson as a 20-year-old worth £16m.
Henderson was a trier who, as Alex Ferguson noted, had a slightly odd way of running.
There was a moment early in the second half when a loose ball spun between the two captains.
Perhaps Shelvey has been the more graceful player through his career, perhaps he is in that sense the more talented.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Klopp's team to win a second title in three seasons, they need City to slip up somewhere.
Under Eddie Howe, Newcastle have been revitalised since the turn of the year and only Liverpool have a better Premier League record since Jan. 1.
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp still has his side fighting on three fronts having already won one trophy this season.
Milner left Newcastle in 2008, but his professionalism and contribution in a black-and-white shirt all those years ago continues to be remembered.
If they can't pip City in the Premier League, it won't be down to a lack of effort, quality or persistence.

The victory put Liverpool two points ahead of champions Manchester City, who can regain first spot with a win at Leeds United later on Saturday.
Newcastle are ninth on 43 points.
After an early half-chance for Virgil van Dijk, Liverpool hit the front in the 19th minute through Keita when he cleverly dribbled past Martin Dubravka to slot home following a smart link-up with Diogo Jota.
Liverpool had a flurry of chances after the break but failed to beat Dubravka, who twice denied Jota as well as substitute Salah before Luis Diaz hit the side-netting in the 84th minute.

Everything Newcastle threw at Liverpool, the German and his partner saw to it instantly.
The Colombian ran the Newcastle defenders ragged in the first half but simmered down the longer the game went on.
His link-up play today was fantastic, unfortunately, his finishing and final ball wasn't.
