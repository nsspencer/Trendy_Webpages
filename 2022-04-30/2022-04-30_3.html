     Newcastle vs Liverpool LIVE: Premier League result, final score and reaction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Close Klopp: 'my new contract will hopefully influence Salah and Mané to stay'Naby Keita ensured Liverpool’s quadruple hopes remain very much alive as he fired them to victory at in-form Newcastle to keep up the pressure on Premier League title rivals Manchester City.
Keita’s assured first-half finish was enough to claim a 1-0 win at St James’ Park on a day when Reds manager Jurgen Klopp was able to rest Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho, Thiago Alcantara and Mohamed Salah from his startling line-up ahead of Tuesday’s decisive Champions League semi-final trip to Villarreal.
Liverpool might - and probably should - have won more comfortably in front of a boisterous crowd of 52,281 as they held the upper hand for much of a contest which saw the Magpies’ hopes of a fifth successive league win and a seventh on the trot at home wilt in the face of almost constant pressure.
Eddie Howe’s men were never able to build up the kind of head of steam which has eased them clear of the relegation battle, perhaps a reminder of how far they have to go before they can once again compete with English football’s best on a sustained basis.
Follow all the reaction from a crucial Reds win at St James’ Park below:

     Newcastle vs Liverpool: Player ratings, analysis and reaction as Keita winner keeps pressure on Man City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Newcastle 0-1 Liverpool (Keita, 19′)Liverpool kept the pressure on Manchester City after moving ahead of them to go top of the Premier League table courtesy of Naby Keita’s first-half winner against Newcastle at St James’ Park.
Perhaps unsurprisingly given the rotation, Liverpool looked disjointed in the opening 15 minutes, but it didn’t take long for them to click into gear.
The Senegalese played a one-two with stand-in right-back Joe Gomez but fired wide when well-positioned inside Newcastle’s penalty area.
“I thought Joe Gomez was different class and like Milly (James Milner) said we need everyone in the squad.
Naby Keita, what a game, James Milner, what a game.
