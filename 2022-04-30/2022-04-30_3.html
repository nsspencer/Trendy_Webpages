     Harvey Elliott Reacts To Liverpool News On Social Media
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool youngster Harvey Elliott has been highly thought of ever since arriving at Anfield from Fulham in 2019.
This came to light as youth striker Fidel O'Rourke signed a new contract with the Reds and Elliott jumped on social media to wish him congratulations.
Elliott joined Curtis Jones and other Reds players to comment on his instagram post to wish him the best.
O'Rourke has been with Liverpool since u14 level but is yet to make a senior appearance for Jurgen Klopp.
Currently a regular in the u21 squad, O'Rourke is a former captain of the u18 side.

     Soccer-Liverpool boss Klopp delighted with squad depth after Newcastle win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEWCASTLE, England (Reuters) – Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp hailed his squad’s depth after they clinched a 1-0 win at Newcastle United on Saturday to provisionally go top of the Premier League table despite the German making five changes to his starting line-up.
Asked about his side’s ability to perform despite the rotation, Klopp told reporters: “It’s cool, eh?
Yeah, that’s the only reason why we are where we are.
“The boys who didn’t come on today, you should’ve seen their faces on the bench when the final whistle went.
Klopp singled out veteran midfielder James Milner for praise following the 36-year-old’s impressive showing on the left side of a midfield three.

     Liverpool keep pressure on Man City with 1-0 win at Newcastle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEWCASTLE, England, April 30 (Reuters) - A first-half strike from midfielder Naby Keita helped Liverpool secure a hard-earned 1-0 win at Newcastle United on Saturday as Juergen Klopp's side kept their Premier League title hopes alive and provisionally went top of the table.
The victory put Liverpool two points ahead of champions Manchester City, who can regain first spot with a win at Leeds United later on Saturday.
"Coming here with five changes and building pretty much a new setup is really difficult, so the performance was absolutely outstanding.
It's really difficult to get a feeling for the game."
It is difficult to do it consistently against Liverpool... we were much more aggressive in the second half but did not have any concerted pressure in the game," he said.

Liverpool had further chances throughout the game but Martin Dubravka was in fine form to keep the lead from increasing.
The Magpies themselves did not offer a great deal going forward with Alisson Becker only forced into one save late on from Bruno Guimares.
Manchester City face Leeds in Saturday's late game to try and regain their lead at the top as they now trail Liverpool by two points.

     Liverpool Rest Stars And Deliver Crucial Win Against Newcastle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In fact, it was the first time this Premier League season that Klopp fielded a team without one of Fabinho, Thiago, Alexander-Arnold, or Salah in the starting XI.
Liverpool then held on to their one-goal lead for the remainder of the game, with the Magpies doing little to trouble Allison.
A crucial second leg match against Villareal in the Champions League semi-final on Tuesday night awaits, where Liverpool are up 2-0 after the first leg win.
Liverpool throughout this season have proven they can win games by narrow margins even when not playing at their best, and in this case, even when not fielding the strongest possible lineup.
In fact, since January 2, the only result that has harmed Liverpool in any way was the 2-2 draw at Manchester City.

     Jurgen Klopp's faith in Liverpool squad vs. Newcastle keeps unbeaten Premier League run and Quadruple quest going
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Klopp's team to win a second title in three seasons, they need City to slip up somewhere.
Under Eddie Howe, Newcastle have been revitalised since the turn of the year and only Liverpool have a better Premier League record since Jan. 1.
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp still has his side fighting on three fronts having already won one trophy this season.
Milner left Newcastle in 2008, but his professionalism and contribution in a black-and-white shirt all those years ago continues to be remembered.
If they can't pip City in the Premier League, it won't be down to a lack of effort, quality or persistence.
