     Bills take “Punt God” Matt Araiza
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Punt God wasn’t the first punter taken in this year’s draft, but he is now off the board.
The Bills took Matt Araiza in the sixth round with the 180th pick.
Araiza set an NCAA record, won the Ray Guy Award and earned the Punt God moniker by averaging 51.2 yards per kick for San Diego State during the 2021 season.
He also served as the school’s placekicker, but he is not expected to do double duty at the professional level.
The Bills signed Matt Haack as a free agent this offseason, but he may find himself on the move if Araiza proves to be as effective in the pros as he was at the collegiate level.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Buffalo Bills selected San Diego State punter Matt Araiza with the first pick of the sixth round of the 2022 NFL draft on Saturday.
Araiza earned the affectionate nickname for his booming punts during his college career and became a fan favorite on social media.
The Baltimore Ravens selected Penn State's Jordan Stout with the No.
Yet it was Araiza who was a consensus All-American and the Ray Guy Award winner as the nation's top punter in 2021.
He averaged an FBS single-season record 51.2 yards per punt and was also San Diego State's kicker while making all 45 of his extra points and 18 of 28 field-goals attempts.

     Summary: Not only did he pick one, he picked The One, the man known as the “Punt God” though Matt Araiza admitted he’s not exactly enamored with that moniker.
130 in the fourth round, the pick Buffalo had traded to Baltimore in order to move up in the first round to pick cornerback Kaiir Elam.
Haack was flawless as holder for Tyler Bass, and that’s a job Araiza did not do at San Diego State.
Araiza was San Diego State’s placekicker for three years and the 6-foot-2, 200-pounder made 73.5% of his field goal attempts and also made 96 of 97 extra points.
He was more of a distance punter and he forced only 17 fair catches, while 15 of his punts went into the end zone for touchbacks.

     2022 NFL Draft shocker: Bills land 'Punt God' Matt Araiza who surprisingly gets taken behind two other punters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The biggest surprise is that college football's top punter, Matt Araiza, wasn't the first punter off the board this year.
Although he was the top punting prospect in the draft, Araiza ended up being the third punter selected.
As for Araiza, the Bills could potentially be getting a steal with their selection of the player known as "Punt God."
To put that in perspective, there were only six punts of 70 or more yards by every NFL punter combined last season.
Stout was one of the top punters in this year's class and it wasn't a total shocker to see him become the first punter taken.
