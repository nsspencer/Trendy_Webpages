     Cowboys Select Wisconsin TE Jake Ferguson with 129th Pick in NFL Draft ✭
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys have taken Wisconsin TE Jake Ferguson with the 129th pick in the 2022 NFL Draft.
Ferguson was heavily involved in the Badger offense for four seasons, catching 145 passes for 1,168 yards and 13 touchdowns in his college career.
Ferguson will backup Dalton Schulz in his rookie season and compete with Jeremy Sprinkle and Sean McKeon for the TE2 spot.
He’s also versatile, having lined up in the slot, as a fullback and as an extra blocker in pass protection for Wisconsin.
Ferguson has the potential to be an excellent blocker, something the Cowboys lacked from their tight ends last season.

     Summary: The Dallas Cowboys drafted the three position groups in the first three rounds that many had predicted.
Brian Martin: The Dallas Cowboys will trade Trysten Hill at some point on Day 3.
The former second-round pick is currently buried on the depth chart and entering the final year of his rookie contract.
Tom Ryle: I think the Cowboys are going to go linebacker and then tight end in that order for the first 2 picks of day 3 to get a couple of the remaining needs filled.

     4th-Round Pick Jake Ferguson Bolsters TE Depth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rundown: The Cowboys considered drafting a tight end as early as the second round and prioritized the position early on Day 3.
Ferguson started 36 games over four seasons with the Badgers and made All-Big Ten the past two years, including first-team honors after posting a team-high 46 catches in 2021.
He also had 13 career touchdown catches.
How He Fits In: Keeping Dalton Schultz on the franchise tag (one year, $10.4 million) was big for the offense and the overall tight end depth.
But after waiving injured veteran Blake Jarwin (hip), the club wanted another tight end to help as a receiver/blocker and contribute in two-tight end sets.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 NFL Draft is nearly in the books, and the NFC East has not disappointed in the three-day event held in Las Vegas.
It should be an exciting draft and you can follow along with every pick on our draft tracker.
A Consensus All-American, First-Team All-SEC talent and national champion, Neal is arguably the best offensive lineman in this year's draft.
An angry runner with enough speed to break loose, the Commanders bookend the first two days of their 2022 NFL Draft with offensive firepower to help Wentz.
Having already owned this year's draft, it would take an implosion for the Eagles to grade poorly at this point.
