     Summary: The two are sons of the late Craig "Ironhead" Heyward, a former NFL fullback who played for the Saints, Bears, Falcons, Rams and Colts from 1988-1998.
Connor plays with a fierceness of a Steeler.
The tight end owns strong hands and barrels through contact.
In addition, he brings a strong contested-catch game and a physicality after the catch to Pittsburgh.
The younger Heyward doesn't have great speed and needs to improve his blocking, but he's a hardnosed worker who could carve out a role.

“No matter what that is, I’m going to embrace it and I’m just excited to be a Steeler.”The Steelers, remarkably, are now up to four sets of brothers on the team.
