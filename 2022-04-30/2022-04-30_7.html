     Clemson wide receiver Justyn Ross goes unpicked in NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was an unexpected drop for Clemson wide receiver Justyn Ross.
Ross, who was seen as likely choice in the top three rounds of seven in the NFL Draft, went unpicked Saturday and was left to find a free agent deal somewhere.
Teams might not be convinced that Ross is fully past a medical condition that sidelined him for an entire year.
As a freshman in 2018, Ross led the ACC and ranked fifth nationally in yards per catch, second in receiving touchdowns and fifth in yards.

     Summary: This is why former Clemson football Justyn Ross went undrafted during the 2022 NFL Draft.
Once thought to be a first-round lock, former Clemson football standout Justyn Ross went undrafted.
However, Ross ran out of time to hear his name called in the 2022 NFL Draft.
Justyn Ross goes undrafted: Why Clemson Tigers wide receiver was not pickedWhile he had to know this was possible, this absolutely stinks for a player as talented as Ross was coming out of high school.

     Former Clemson Tiger Justyn Ross Not Selected In NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NFL Draft has come and gone with former Clemson wideout Justyn Ross never hearing his name called.
The last time Clemson had just two players selected in the draft was in 2008, when Tommy Bowden was the head coach in the 2008 NFL Draft.
In 2019, Ross hauled in a team-high 66 catches for 865 yards and nine touchdowns, earning All-ACC honorable mention honors.
Although, despite leading the team in catches (46) and receiving yards (514), Ross never looked like quite the same player.
Maybe there is a team out there willing to take a shot on the talented receiver as an undrafted free agent, maybe not, but this certainly isn't how Ross' Clemson career was expected to end.
