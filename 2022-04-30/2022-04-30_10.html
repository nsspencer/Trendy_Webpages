     Jokes, Glamour and a Try for Normalcy as Correspondents’ Dinner Returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, opted against going to the dinner because of the obvious danger.
Organizers required all guests to be vaccinated, boosted and test negative before attending, although few wore masks besides the serving staff.
As a concession to the potential peril, Mr. Biden, who at 79 is in a high-risk age group, skipped the dinner and came only for the speaking portion of the evening.
But his presence was meant to represent a return to normalcy after Mr. Trump’s war on the news media.
“The free press is not the enemy of the people,” Mr. Biden said.

     White House Correspondents' Dinner returns with president in attendance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The White House Correspondents' Dinner made its grand return Saturday night, two years after the pandemic shut it down and six years since the last time a commander-in-chief attended the event.
The event is held by the White House Correspondents' Association, which represents White House reporters, and has been a tradition since 1921.
Noah mocked the White House Correspondents’ Dinner as a “superspreader event.”He also noted that Washington’s elite had gathered only weeks after there was a COVID-19 outbreak.
Dozens of elected officials, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, contracted the virus.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Friday that Biden is taking extra precautions.
