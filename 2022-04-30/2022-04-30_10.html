     Bills take “Punt God” Matt Araiza
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Punt God wasn’t the first punter taken in this year’s draft, but he is now off the board.
The Bills took Matt Araiza in the sixth round with the 180th pick.
Araiza set an NCAA record, won the Ray Guy Award and earned the Punt God moniker by averaging 51.2 yards per kick for San Diego State during the 2021 season.
He also served as the school’s placekicker, but he is not expected to do double duty at the professional level.
The Bills signed Matt Haack as a free agent this offseason, but he may find himself on the move if Araiza proves to be as effective in the pros as he was at the collegiate level.

     Summary: The Buffalo Bills have drafted a punter.
The Bills drafted PUNT GOD Matt Araiza to open the sixth round of the 2022 NFL Draft.
Araiza is firmly ahead of punter Matt Haack, who took a pay cut this offseason just to avoid being cut.
Araiza has earned the nickname “Punt God” due to his booming leg.
With few available paths to a roster spot, Araiza will have one much like when they drafted Tyler Bass a couple years ago.

     2022 NFL Draft shocker: Bills land 'Punt God' Matt Araiza who surprisingly gets taken behind two other punters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The biggest surprise is that college football's top punter, Matt Araiza, wasn't the first punter off the board this year.
Although he was the top punting prospect in the draft, Araiza ended up being the third punter selected.
As for Araiza, the Bills could potentially be getting a steal with their selection of the player known as "Punt God."
To put that in perspective, there were only six punts of 70 or more yards by every NFL punter combined last season.
Stout was one of the top punters in this year's class and it wasn't a total shocker to see him become the first punter taken.
