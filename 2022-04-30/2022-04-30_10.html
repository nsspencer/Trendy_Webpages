     Summary: Nothing in sports is sillier than grading draft picks instantly.
Weird pick for Browns positionally.‚ÄùThe same site gave them a B-plus for selecting defensive end Alex Wright from Alabama-Birmingham 78th overall.
His value was that of a mid-Day 3 pick.‚ÄùSports Illustrated was generous by giving the Browns a B-plus for using the 99th pick on wide receiver David Bell.
‚ÄúThe Browns addressed their need at wide receiver by trading for Amari Cooper.
Bell was the 16th wide receiver drafted.

     Summary: The good news is that David Bell was drafted to a team that can almost immediately use his talents.
The bad news is that team was the Cleveland Browns.
Bell was the 99th overall selection in last night‚Äôs NFL Draft, putting him later in the third round as a compensatory pick.

     Browns believe David Bell possessed 'some of the best hands in the draft class'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He's capable of playing outside, too, although the Browns already have at least one player capable of filling that role with Amari Cooper.
The biggest reason, perhaps, why Bell was available that late in the draft was because of measurables at the Combine.
He ran a below-average 4.65 seconds in the 40-yard dash, but Berry said the Browns didn't alter their evaluation on Bell because of it.
A fast 40-yard time does not always define the talent of a receiver, and the Browns believe the production and quality tape Bell displayed from Purdue overrides any measurement shortfalls.
The Browns believe the answer will be "yes," and they believe it will show sooner rather than later.
