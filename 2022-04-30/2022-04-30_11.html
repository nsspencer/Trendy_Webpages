     Summary: The two are sons of the late Craig "Ironhead" Heyward, a former NFL fullback who played for the Saints, Bears, Falcons, Rams and Colts from 1988-1998.
Connor plays with a fierceness of a Steeler.
The tight end owns strong hands and barrels through contact.
In addition, he brings a strong contested-catch game and a physicality after the catch to Pittsburgh.
The younger Heyward doesn't have great speed and needs to improve his blocking, but he's a hardnosed worker who could carve out a role.

     Summary: "When Coach Tuck came in, coach (William) Peagler was my running back coach," Heyward explained.
Asked about if he expects to play a role on special teams, Heyward said "100%."
"At Michigan State, I played special teams, around three or four special team units a year, so I know what it takes to be successful on special teams.
MSU's last tight end taken in the draft was Dion Sims, a fourth-round pick of Miami in 2013.
