    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: City came into today's game knowing they had to win to go back to the top of the table after Liverpool beat Newcastle 0-1.
Pep always says the opposition will be tough, but this time at least it was believable that Leeds were going to put up something of a fight.
Before Dallas had even hit the deck he knew he was playing no further part in the game.
Leeds to be fair kept chuntering away, and a lovely Raphinha run nearly got them a goal, but Laporte was there to block.
And the home side's problem was that City were still keen to add to their tally, and so they did.

     Summary: It was a tale of two set-pieces at Elland Road as Manchester City kept themselves top of the Premier League with three precious points with a 4-0 win over Leeds United on Saturday evening.
Wasted a late chance, not that it matters too much, and then got a great late block in.
Ruben Dias - 7 Twitter: if2is Used his physicality wonderfully to head it down for Ake and create the second goal.
Nathan Ake - 8Another great performance at left-back, capped off when he bundled in the second goal with the game at a crucial junction.
Fernandinho - 7Scored a fantastic goal, and potentially his last ever for City - what a way to sign off if so!

Frustratingly for Leeds, City scored with their first real attempt of the match.
Like in the first half, City found the net relatively early again in the second, and again it was from a set-play.
In stoppage time, the away side added another goal on the counter-attack with plenty of Leeds players up the pitch.

     Leeds vs Man City: Player ratings and analysis as City reclaim top spot from Liverpool with win at Elland Road
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leeds 0-4 Man City (Rodri 13′, Ake 54′, Jesus 78′, Fernandinho 90+3′)Manchester City reclaimed pole position in the Premier League table with a comfortable win against Leeds, a few hours after being temporarily dislodged by title rivals Liverpool.
City managed to quieten the home faithful, albeit temporarily, 10 minutes later by taking the lead through Rodri.
Dallas has started in all 72 of Leeds’ Premier League games since their promotion in 2020 but will almost certainly miss their final few fixtures of the season.
Perhaps surprisingly given their reputation as a passing side, City have scored more set-piece goals (18) than any other Premier League side in 2021-22.
Ake hobbled off soon after which could exacerbate City’s injury issues in defence ahead of the Champions League second leg against Real Madrid, with John Stones and Kyle Walker already sidelined.
