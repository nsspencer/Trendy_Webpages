The event is held by the White House Correspondents' Association, which represents White House reporters, and has been a tradition since 1921.

     White House correspondents’ dinner: Biden jokes about return to near-normal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadWashington’s media and political elite partied like it was 2019 on Saturday at the annual White House correspondents’ dinner, the traditionally glitzy spring gala that staggered back to life after a pandemic-induced two-year hiatus.
There were even a healthy cohort of actual White House correspondents in attendance; the journalist contingent in the room is often diluted by the number of corporate suits and high-ranking pols who score seats at tables bought by media organizations.
The White House Correspondents’ Association decided to forge ahead anyway, instituting a double requirement of vaccinations and testing on guests.
He then held a mock news conference featuring actual White House reporters.
Dunnigan, of the Associated Negro Press, and Payne, who worked for the Chicago Defender, were the first African American women to become White House correspondents in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

     Biden roasts Trump and himself at correspondents’ dinner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The White House Correspondents' Association dinner, which the pandemic sidelined in 2020 and 2021, returned with Biden as the first president in six years to accept an invitation.
"Just imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year," Biden told an audience of 2,600, among them journalists, government officials and celebrities.
The White House Correspondents’ Association said it was requiring same-day antigen testing for its dinner attendees even before the Gridiron outbreak.
As vice president in 2014, Biden appeared in a comedy video with the star of HBO's "Veep," Julia Louis-Dreyfus, which drew big laughs at the correspondents' dinner.
At the 2011 dinner, Obama skewered an unamused Trump — in his presence — over Trump's fictitious claims about the then-president's birth certificate.
