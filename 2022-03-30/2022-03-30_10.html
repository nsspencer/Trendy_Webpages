     Congressman enters Hunter Biden’s 'laptop from hell' into congressional record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This week in the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, FBI Assistant Director for the Cyber Division Bryan Vorndran was pressed by Congressman Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., on whether the Hunter Biden laptop created cyber vulnerabilities for the United States.Vorndran confessed that he did not know the location of the laptop or whether actors such as Russia were using the laptop’s contents to compromise the First Family.“Who has it?” Gaetz asked.“I don’t know who has it,” the witness responded to surprise.Next, Gaetz entered into the committee record the contents of Hunter’s Biden’s laptop and a receipt from Mac’s Computer Repair evidencing the FBI taking possession of the laptop in December 2019.
Still, the FBI Cyber Assistant Director testified that after three years in possession of the laptop, no assessment had been made.“How are Americans supposed to trust that you can protect us from the next Colonial pipeline if it seems you can’t locate a laptop that was given to you three years ago from the First Family, potentially creating vulnerabilities for our country?” Gaetz asked.Utilizing the exact language Robert Mueller offered the Judiciary Committee when ignoring Democratic National Committee ties to the Steele Dossier, the FBI Cyber Assistant Director said Hunter’s laptop was not in his “purview.”Gaetz further referenced the “international business deals, kickbacks and shakedowns” that would allow foreign adversaries to compromise the First Family.
The FBI Cyber witness would not or could not testify that the First Family was not compromised by the Laptop’s contents.Assistant Director Vorndarn committed to carry Gaetz’s demand for a further briefing on the matter to the FBI.Gaetz entered the contents of the laptop into the committee record to be preserved forever.

On March 22, 2018, Hudson West Three wired one million dollars to Owasco, another Hunter Biden company.
“So, the company that Patrick Ho was making bribes for sends one million dollars to a company Hunter Biden manages and is invested in.
In a recently uncovered audio extracted from his laptop, Hunter Biden referred to Patrick Ho as the [QUOTE] [expletive deleted] spy chief of China.
