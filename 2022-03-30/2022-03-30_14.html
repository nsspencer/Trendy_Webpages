     2-time Super Bowl champion Malcolm Jenkins announces his retirement from the NFL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2 time Super Bowl champion &amp; 3 time pro bowler @MalcolmJenkins tells @thepivot crew that he is retiring after an amazing 13 year career!!
Jenkins, 34, won Super Bowl XLIV with the Saints and earned another championship in Super Bowl LII with the Philadelphia Eagles before returning to where his career started.
The three-time Pro Bowler rarely missed a snap in his 13-year career, making him one of the NFL’s great ironmen.
Jenkins is stepping away from football in great health and with a wide variety of other business interests to pursue as an investor and entrepreneur.
But for the Saints, this opens a tremendous vacancy in their secondary — Jenkins led the team in defense snaps played last season.

     Longtime Saints, Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins announces retirement after 13 seasons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 13 NFL seasons, two-time Super Bowl champion safety Malcolm Jenkins will no longer be going on patrols.
A do-it-all safety ideal for the modern game, Jenkins entered the NFL as a first-round draft pick by the New Orleans Saints in 2009 out of Ohio State.
The ballhawk spent his first five seasons in New Orleans, winning a Super Bowl as a rookie and earning second-team All-Pro honors in his sophomore season.
He later signed a big-money contract in Philadelphia, where he earned three Pro Bowl bids and helped the Eagles to their first Super Bowl victory.
"In so many ways, Malcolm Jenkins defined everything we want a Philadelphia Eagle to be," Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement.

     3-time Pro Bowl safety, activist Malcolm Jenkins retires
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jenkins helped both the New Orleans Saints and Philadelphia Eagles win their only Super Bowl and made a major impact off the field as an activist, entrepreneur and philanthropist.
“I’ve been playing football since I was 7 years old, and I’ve accomplished so much in that time,” Jenkins told The Associated Press.
He left New Orleans for Philadelphia in 2014 and started every game during six seasons with the Eagles.
Jenkins played 2,651 consecutive snaps from the start of the 2017 playoffs through part of the 2020 season in New Orleans.
“I think competition is probably the biggest thing that I’ll miss about the game,” Jenkins said.
