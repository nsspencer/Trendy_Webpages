     Summary: Probably, there's a little more juice to the squeeze if he wanted to continue playing.
But the NFL never was the end game for Jenkins.
He was a fantastic player, but that didn't scratch the surface of being the whole of him.
He always seems to have had, and continues to have, much more of himself to give than what was shared with the game.
And this time, Malcolm Jenkins will leave the Saints' facility of his own volition.

     3-time Pro Bowl safety, activist Malcolm Jenkins retires
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jenkins helped both the New Orleans Saints and Philadelphia Eagles win their only Super Bowl and made a major impact off the field as an activist, entrepreneur and philanthropist.
“I’ve been playing football since I was 7 years old, and I’ve accomplished so much in that time,” Jenkins told The Associated Press.
He left New Orleans for Philadelphia in 2014 and started every game during six seasons with the Eagles.
Jenkins played 2,651 consecutive snaps from the start of the 2017 playoffs through part of the 2020 season in New Orleans.
“I think competition is probably the biggest thing that I’ll miss about the game,” Jenkins said.
