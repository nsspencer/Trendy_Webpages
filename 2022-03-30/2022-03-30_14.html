     Rolex’s Biggest Release of 2022 Is…
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the Watches &amp; Wonders trade show in Geneva brings an avalanche of new pieces from nearly every watchmaker on the planet, none are quite as eagerly anticipated as the Crown’s.
This is despite the fact that Rolex moves at a glacial pace, tweaking sizes or swapping out bracelets and occasionally resurfacing old models.
Here's the big news from the brand at the biggest watch show on earth.
Today, as part of the industry trade show Watches &amp; Wonders, Rolex is showing off a new GMT with a brand new color combination: green and black.
The crown and the date window have both been flipped to the left side of the case.

     Now This Is Unexpected: A New Rolex GMT-Master II for Left-Handers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Out of all the models Rolex could've released, with watch enthusiasm and commercial potential soaring at an all-time high, what we have here is…a GMT-Master II for lefties?
Sure, many of us expected some kind of GMT following last year's reintroduction of steel models with Oyster bracelets.
Shocker number one: The green and black bezel.
Shocker number two: The crown protruding from the left side of the case.
In watch parlance, this is a "destro," which means it's designed for those who wear their watch on their right wrist.

     Introducing Two New Wild Rolex Yacht-Master 42mm Models – One In Yellow Gold And Another With A Falcon's Eye Dial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On one hand, I love the yellow gold model because – well – I love yellow gold.
It looks like a watch that has existed, or at least should always existed and that's a good thing.
On the other hand, just look at the Falcon's Eye dial!
It is undeniably cool, and one of those things that makes you look closer and closer.
Did Rolex need to create a dial like this?

     First review of what’s new from Rolex
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul Altieri loves Rolex so much he built a business around his passion for collecting the company’s watches.
It is known that Rolex produced left-handed watches in very small numbers as early as the 1950’s, but more than likely by special request.
Rolex has been offering the 42mm Yacht Master in only white gold, which has been a terrific seller for us.
It doesn’t come as a huge surprise that Rolex expanded the 42mm Yacht-Master family by adding another metal type – yellow gold.
Rolex will now only be offering the Tiffany Blue and green dial in 31mm and 36mm sizes.

     Rolex Just Unveiled Its New Watches for 2022, Including a New Air-King and a GMT-Master II
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fervid speculation over what Rolex would announce at Watches &amp; Wonders—now an annual ritual amongst the global watch community—is finally at an end.
Rolex Oyster Perpetual Air-KingRolex brought the Air-King back in 2016 after a short hiatus—and speculation about when it would get another update has been rife ever since.
Like the new Air-King, the new Oyster Perpetual also benefits from the legibility-boosting optimized Chromalight display and the manufacture’s newly developed luminescent material.
Like the larger Yacht-Master also introduced today, it also has Rolex’s new Oysterflex bracelet and folding safety clasp improving wearability.
