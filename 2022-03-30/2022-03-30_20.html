     Cricket-England crush South Africa, to meet Australia in World Cup final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Reuters) – Danni Wyatt scored her second one-day international century as champions England crushed South Africa by 137 runs in Christchurch on Thursday to set up a mouthwatering Women’s World Cup final against heavyweights Australia.
Wyatt, dropped five times by the wasteful South Africans, made 129 off 125 balls to help England put an imposing 293 for eight on the board at Hagley Oval after South Africa won the toss and elected to field.
Burly seamer Anya Shrubsole, the hero of the 2017 World Cup final, pressed the advantage by removing both South Africa’s openers cheaply before the world’s top-ranked spinner Sophie Ecclestone took six wickets as South Africa were routed for 156.
Their victory over South Africa was their most complete performance of the tournament, with Sophia Dunkley chipping in 60 in a 116-run partnership for the fifth wicket.
By that time, England were well on the way to setting South Africa a would-be world record chase.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s not a coincidence that TechCrunch has covered more African startups in the last year than any period in our history.
Many of those companies are Nigerian, and when we look at venture capital data, we can see why.
The country has posted steady progress in the last three years as the leading African startup market.
With 18 startups, it is the first African country to have the third-largest representation when categorized by country.
That’s a milestone for Nigeria, yes, but also an indication of how quickly the African startup scene has developed in a short period of time.

     Summary: A maiden World Cup hundred from Danni Wyatt and a first five-wicket haul in international cricket from Sophie Ecclestone powered England into the World Cup final as they handed South Africa a 137-run defeat at Christchurch on Thursday.
In all, England scored 31 runs from the final three overs, ensuring South Africa would require the highest successful chase in women’s ODI history to reach the final.

Earlier, after opting to bowl first, South Africa had started firmly on top.
The England captain was finally dismissed by Ayabonga Khaka in the 13th over, after South Africa successfully reviewed a close lbw call against her.

     Summary: England were clinical as they beat South Africa by 137 runs to advance to the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2022 final and keep their title defence alive.
In response, South Africa were rocked as Laura Wolvaardt and Lizelle Lee fell early before Sophie Ecclestone continued her red-hot form to take six for 36 to bowl South Africa out for 156.
Ecclestone and Dunkley clawed back any momentum South Africa had built with that wicket before Dunkley departed for 60 caught going for a big drive to mid-off.
Lee followed in Shrubsole’s next over, as Sciver held on to a catch at midwicket to reduce South Africa to eight for two.
Dean held on to a catch to dismiss Ismail as Ecclestone kept piling on the pressure to leave South Africa on the brink of 148 for eight.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Against South Africa in the 2022 ODI World Cup semi-final, England achieved that feat with an emphatic 137-run win in Christchurch.
Anya Shrubsole's two early strikes, too, played a pivotal role in England's successful defence of 293, skittling South Africa out for 156 in 38 overs.
Against an opposition that consigned them to a heartbreaking loss in the semi-final in Derby five years ago, South Africa bore the brunt of slipshod fielding.
Wyatt's fourth-wicket century stand with Dunkley steered England to the second-highest total in a 50-over World Cup knockout after South Africa sent them in slightly overcast and windy conditions at the Hagley Oval.
South Africa started off reasonably well in their new-ball burst on a fresh Hagley Oval surface that had a fair amount of bounce, carry and movement.

     Africa’s struggle with hepatitis B
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The continent also lags behind the rest of the world in preventing hepatitis B through vaccination.
According to Kramvis, Africa’s lack of basic hepatitis B virus surveillance, limited access to laboratories and political inaction make addressing this issue tricky.
For such action to reach the people who need it, however, the widespread ignorance surrounding hepatitis B must be tackled head-on.
The prevalence of hepatitis B is estimated to be 4–6% of the population, but the exact figure is unknown.
Hepatitis B testing in Africa is frequently carried out in basic settings.Credit: Imperial College LondonThe pandemic has hampered hepatitis B programmes on a global scale.
