     Violence in eastern Colombia has left 130 dead this year, UN says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Some 130 people have been killed and more than 3,000 have been forcibly displaced this year as violence has surged in eastern Colombia, according to the United Nations and the Catholic Church.
The institutions have called on armed groups to stop the violence and respect international humanitarian law in a joint statement published Wednesday, after officials visited the Colombian region of Arauca, which borders Venezuela.
"During the visit, the representatives met with authorities, civil society and human rights organizations, and expressed solidarity with the communities, victims, civil society organisations and institutions suffering from the situation of violence in the region," the statement said.
Fighting erupted between the National Liberation Army -- the largest leftist guerrilla group in the country, known by its Spanish acronym ELN -- and dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in the early hours of January 2, according to Colombia's ombudsman Carlos Camargo.
More than 20 people were killed in those clashes, according to a spokesperson from Colombia's Attorney General's Office.

     Could Fracking Save Colombia’s Energy Industry?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: These events have substantially ratcheted up the degree of risk and uncertainty surrounding Colombia’s oil industry.
Those remote regions where much of Colombia’s coca is grown possess large oil reserves and have significant industry assets leading to a heightened security risk for onshore energy operations.
In 2020, according to Reuters, Colombia’s national oil company Ecopetrol recorded 51 assaults on energy infrastructure and there were more than 28 such attacks in 2021.
Essentially, Petro plans to terminate (Spanish) the award of oil exploration licenses while allowing existing operators to continue pumping petroleum until Colombia’s reserves are exhausted.
That has ratcheted up the political and regularity risk for Colombia’s oil industry at a crucial time when it is struggling to recover from surging violence and the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with Petro leading in the polls.
