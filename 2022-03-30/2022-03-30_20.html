     Bruins sign goalie Brandon Bussi from Western Michigan to amateur tryout agreement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins have bolstered their organizational goaltending depth for next season.
The team announced Wednesday it had signed Brandon Bussi, most recently with Western Michigan University, to a one-year, entry-level contract for the 2022-23 season at a cap hit of $825,000.
The 23-year-old netminder will spend the remainder of this season with AHL Providence on an amateur tryout agreement (ATO).
Over 77 career games at Western Michigan, Bussi was 46-25-5 with a 2.61 goals against average and .910 save percentage.
Svedeback was the first goalie Boston had drafted since current starter Jeremy Swayman (fourth round, 111th overall) in 2017.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And of course, the Florida Panthers took down the defending Stanley Cup runners-up, the Montreal Canadi—oh, what’s that?
Aside from the Mrazek injury, which was nobody’s fault, the Leafs also lost a pair of defensemen, Justin Holl and Ilya Lyubushkin, during the second period.
More blatantly shitty was Taylor Hall’s retaliatory punch from behind on Lyubushkin after the Bruins forward got checked down by the boards.
Brad Marchand, who’s normally so self-possessed, got a misconduct penalty for something he said to the officials at the end of the second period after a confrontation with Leafs captain John Tavares.
They’ve done all right for themselves so far this season, winning 5-2 in November and then getting the two points on Tuesday.

     Bruce Cassidy Hints Bruins’ Line Changes; Here’s Two Potential Options
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NESN Logo Sign InBruins head coach Bruce Cassidy indicated Boston’s lineup could be dealt a shuffle following Tuesday’s loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs.
Cassidy noted Wednesday how any potential lineup change would be done in order to keep players who haven’t played recently motivated.
The Bruins next take the ice Thursday against the New Jersey Devils, and it feels like the defense will be where any potential change occurs.
With Cassidy wanting to move some players into the lineup who haven’t played in some time, the first name that comes to mind is Reilly.
Reilly, however, after seeing how he played in a playoff push last season, could provide the Bruins a spark.

     Boston Bruins Lineup ‘Changes’ Coming After Sluggish Leafs Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON – The Boston Bruins were looking to work some new faces into the lineup this week anyway, but a disappointingly porous defensive effort on Tuesday night against the Toronto Maple Leafs probably hastened that a bit.
In other words, it was the first Boston Bruins stink bomb in the last six weeks of play dating back to a shutout loss to the Caroline Hurricanes in early February.
“You have to take care of the puck, we didn’t do enough of that early on,” said Boston Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy.
“There will be some lineup changes,” said Boston Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy in the minutes after the tough loss to the Maple Leafs.

We’ll wait to get here in the morning and see if there’s any surprises,” said Cassidy.
Forbort was not as noticeable as some other D-men – considering his stay-at-home game, that’s not a knock – but Clifton had a particularly rough first period, when he was directly responsible for two goals against.

Standing at the point, Clifton one-timed a pass shuttled his way from Taylor Hall on the near half-wall.
There was a good offensive play for Clifton to make there, noted Cassidy, and it wasn’t to launch a rocket that Kerfoot caught.
