Prince Harry did not attend the service for his grandfather and now the Duke of Edinburgh‘s former protection officer is sounding off on the Duke of Sussex‘s “pathetic excuse” for not being there.
However, many thought Prince Harry would travel and be in attendance; that is until he announced otherwise.
“Imagine missing your mentor grandfather’s memorial service because you’re such a spoiled brat you’d rather sulk in your Californian mansion than be there to support your grandmother?

     Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Have Been Off Social Media for Two Years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The two-year anniversary of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's departure from social media occurred on Wednesday, with the couple last posting to their official @sussexroyal Instagram account in March 2020.
Before her marriage to Harry, Meghan ran successful social media accounts across various platforms including Instagram and her blog, The Tig.
When a story was published by The Times in January 2021 stating that "Harry and Meghan quit social media" for good, the prince disputed it.
"The truth is, despite its well-documented ills, social media can offer a means of connecting and community, which are vital to us as human beings."
Now two years on from their initial stepping away from social media, Harry and Meghan are working to communicate through other forms of digital media, including their multi-million dollar contract with Netflix to produce video content.
