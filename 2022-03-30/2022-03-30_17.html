     Rolex’s Biggest Release of 2022 Is…
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the Watches &amp; Wonders trade show in Geneva brings an avalanche of new pieces from nearly every watchmaker on the planet, none are quite as eagerly anticipated as the Crown’s.
This is despite the fact that Rolex moves at a glacial pace, tweaking sizes or swapping out bracelets and occasionally resurfacing old models.
Here's the big news from the brand at the biggest watch show on earth.
Today, as part of the industry trade show Watches &amp; Wonders, Rolex is showing off a new GMT with a brand new color combination: green and black.
The crown and the date window have both been flipped to the left side of the case.

     Summary: Out of all the models Rolex could've released, with watch enthusiasm and commercial potential soaring at an all-time high, what we have here is…a GMT-Master II for lefties?
Sure, many of us expected some kind of GMT following last year's reintroduction of steel models with Oyster bracelets.
Shocker number one: The green and black bezel.
Shocker number two: The crown protruding from the left side of the case.
In watch parlance, this is a "destro," which means it's designed for those who wear their watch on their right wrist.

On the other hand, just look at the Falcon's Eye dial!
It is undeniably cool, and one of those things that makes you look closer and closer.
