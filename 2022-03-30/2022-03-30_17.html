     Harry Styles shares visual teaser for new single, “As It Was” – 97.9 WRMF
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyIt appears we might get not only a new song from Harry Styles this week — we might get a brand-new music video, too!
In the new clip, Harry sits on the floor as he spins as if on an invisible record player, then looks directly at the camera before the screen cuts to black.
The nine-second clip doesn’t tease any lyrics, but it does reveal the tempo and a bit of the song’s apparently upbeat melody.
“As It Was,” which comes out April 1, is the first single from the singer’s forthcoming album, Harry’s House.
The album, which is the followup to 2019’s Fine Line, is now available for pre-save and will hit stores on May 20.

     Samantha Markle slams ‘ridiculous’ Prince Harry for missing Prince Philip’s memorial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Samantha Markle slams ‘ridiculous’ Prince Harry for missing Prince Philip’s memorialPrince Harry has been dubbed ‘ridiculous’ by Samantha Markle for missing Prince Philip’s memorial over a security bidSamantha, the half-sister of Harry's wife Meghan Markle, made this accusation in her interview with the Daily Star.
There she was quoted saying, “He should have hired more of his own security, they live a lavish lifestyle, they can afford security, it's ridiculous.”“Security for a weekend of something is not that expensive and I'm pretty sure they have security now.
It would be so easy for him to pay for his own security.”This claim comes shortly after Prince Harry’s team explained how private security would never be able to provide security similar to that of the UK state.
In the eyes of Samantha, it is “mind-boggling” that Harry would put security issues beyond his obligation to the late Prince Philip.
“Especially now for this memorial and after everything that transpired and Prince Philip seemed to have a rough time in his last days watching the Royal Family being attacked by Meghan and Harry.”“Maybe Harry feels bad about that but it seems the least he could do would be to show up, pay respect and try to if he and Meghan are humanitarians, to show up humbly and pay respects and show some remorse at a minimum.”“Not to mention the fact, Prince Philip was his grandfather but Harry has been in service, Prince Philip served in World War Two, not only to honour him as his grandfather but also a military figure, who is noted for great service is highly disrespectful.”Before concluding she added, “To put something as petty as security ahead of the obvious ethical, humane military and royal respect, it doesn't make sense, it's sad.”

Prince Harry did not attend the service for his grandfather and now the Duke of Edinburgh‘s former protection officer is sounding off on the Duke of Sussex‘s “pathetic excuse” for not being there.
However, many thought Prince Harry would travel and be in attendance; that is until he announced otherwise.
“Imagine missing your mentor grandfather’s memorial service because you’re such a spoiled brat you’d rather sulk in your Californian mansion than be there to support your grandmother?

     Summary: Prince Harry, who missed Prince Philip’s memorial service, ‘burnt his boats’ with Royal family, according to a Royal photographer.
The Duke of Sussex is facing backlash for his decision to skip his late grandfather's event at Westminster Abbey on Tuesday.
Arthur Edwards, who has been photographing the Royal Family for The Sun since 1977 explained how Prince Harry had 'lost out'.
Arthur said: “Royals young and old came from far and wide to Westminster Abbey yesterday to pay tribute to Prince Philip – except one.
“Prince Harry’s excuse for avoiding the memorial service for his own grandfather because of “security fears” is, quite frankly, lame.

     Summary: The two-year anniversary of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's departure from social media occurred on Wednesday, with the couple last posting to their official @sussexroyal Instagram account in March 2020.
Before her marriage to Harry, Meghan ran successful social media accounts across various platforms including Instagram and her blog, The Tig.
When a story was published by The Times in January 2021 stating that "Harry and Meghan quit social media" for good, the prince disputed it.
"The truth is, despite its well-documented ills, social media can offer a means of connecting and community, which are vital to us as human beings."
Now two years on from their initial stepping away from social media, Harry and Meghan are working to communicate through other forms of digital media, including their multi-million dollar contract with Netflix to produce video content.

     Summary: Brooklyn is set to wed actress Nicola Peltz, 27, on April 9 at her family’s oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, a short flight from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's $14 million Californian home.
David, 46, and Victoria, 47, are good friends with Prince Harry, 38, and Meghan, 40, even attending their nuptials at Windsor Castle in May 2018.
In February 2020, the former professional footballer spoke about how 'he's proud' of his 'amazing' friend Prince Harry following his marriage to Meghan and the birth of their son, Archie.
Meanwhile it emerged later that year that Prince Harry and Meghan hired David and Victoria's highly-rated former aide to join their Los Angeles team.
Speculation has mounted as Prince Harry faced criticism for missing Prince Philip's memorial service yesterday.
