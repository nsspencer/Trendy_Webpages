     Eric Church Cancels Show to Attend Basketball Playoff Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fans holding tickets to see Eric Church's Gather Again Tour stop at AT&amp;T Center in San Antonio, Texas, got a surprise from the Chief this week — a cancellation.
Church sent out a message to his fan club, the Church Choir, informing them that he was canceling the April 2 show.
Tour stop cancellations and postponements haven't been uncommon in the last two years, but this one was not related to COVID-19.
Instead, Church will be attending the NCAA Men's Final Four matchup between Duke and North Carolina in New Orleans.
The letter said all purchased tickets will be refunded and no action is required on fans' behalf.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: North Carolina native, lifelong Tar Heel basketball fan and country music superstar Eric Church has canceled a Texas concert in order to watch the NCAA Men’s Final Four, he announced in a message to fans on March 29.
Church, a native of Granite Falls in Caldwell County, is missing his April 2 tour date in San Antonio to watch North Carolina play rival Duke in the semifinals of the men’s NCAA tournament.
He said seeing the game is a “sport’s enthusiast’s dream,” according to a personal message from Ticketmaster posted to social media by fans.
“Woody Durham always said, ‘Go where you go and do what you do,’ thanks for letting me go here and be with the Tar Heels,” he wrote of the historic matchup against Duke.
Fans anticipating the Saturday concert will receive a refund, the message said.

With that in mind, imagine how your North Carolina basketball excuse reads to us!
If you're obsessed with basketball, don't schedule a concert during the Final Four.
I can't even imagine having almost every weekend of the year planned out a year or two in advance.

One performer is joining North Carolinians in dropping everything to watch the match Saturday, though he had some pretty big plans that night!
Country music superstar Eric Church is canceling a concert Saturday in San Antonio just to attend the big game.
Church was born in Caldwell County and, well, his blood runs Carolina blue for sure!
For their part, some Church fans have started tweeting “Go Duke!” which is probably the harshest insult imaginable for the UNC diehard.
