     Country star Eric Church cancels San Antonio concert amid Final Four matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Gray News) - Some fans of country musician Eric Church are singing the blues.
Church’s San Antonio appearance Saturday, part of his “The Gather Again Tour,” has been canceled, Ticketmaster said.
The star is ditching this concert date to watch a Final Four game of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, also known as “March Madness,” Variety and other outlets reported.
Some fans on social media were predictably upset by the ruined concert plans, with one saying “Dude didn’t even reschedule.
Ticketmaster said fans should be able to get their refunds within 30 days.

     Country star Eric Church cancels show so he can watch UNC-Duke Final Four game, angers fans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Country star Eric Church upset some fans Tuesday when he announced he was canceling an upcoming tour date so he could attend an NCAA Final Four tournament match on the same night.
Church said he was canceling the date so that he could watch his beloved University of North Carolina men's basketball team face off against rival Duke University.
Church, who refers to his fans as the "Church choir," reportedly said giving up the show was the "most selfish" thing he could ask of them.
Located about 10 miles apart in North Carolina — Duke in Durham and UNC in Chapel Hill — the two elite basketball programs have a longstanding rivalry.
So for a few people who didn't have a stake in the concert, Church's choice to cancel the tour date was labeled "relatable and hilarious."

With that in mind, imagine how your North Carolina basketball excuse reads to us!
If you're obsessed with basketball, don't schedule a concert during the Final Four.
I can't even imagine having almost every weekend of the year planned out a year or two in advance.

     Summary: This is going to be a matchup for the ages, everyone pretty much agrees.
One performer is joining North Carolinians in dropping everything to watch the match Saturday, though he had some pretty big plans that night!
Country music superstar Eric Church is canceling a concert Saturday in San Antonio just to attend the big game.
Church was born in Caldwell County and, well, his blood runs Carolina blue for sure!
For their part, some Church fans have started tweeting “Go Duke!” which is probably the harshest insult imaginable for the UNC diehard.
