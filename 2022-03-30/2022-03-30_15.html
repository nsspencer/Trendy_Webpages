     Game of Thrones spinoff House of the Dragon premieres August 21st
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HBO’s upcoming Game of Thrones spinoff, House of the Dragon, will debut on HBO and HBO Max on August 21st.
Martin’s 2019 book Fire and Blood and is focused on, as the name suggests, House Targaryen.
It’s set 200 years before the events of the hugely popular Game of Thrones, which featured Daenerys Targaryen as one of the main characters.
HBO first announced House of the Dragon was in the works in October 2019.
House of the Dragon’s August 21st release date means it will be pitted against Amazon’s upcoming The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Prime Video series, which debuts September 2nd.

     Summary: Yes, Another TargaryenJust when you thought you’d seen all the blonde wigs, here’s Eve Best as Princess Rhaenys Targaryen with her husband, Lord Corlys Velaryon, aka “the Sea Snake” (played by Steve Toussaint).
His nickname is more robust than hers, “The Queen Who Never Was,” given after she was passed over for Iron Throne duties in favor of Viserys, her cousin.
(Side note: remember when Game of Thrones changed Asha Greyjoy’s name to “Yara” so viewers wouldn’t get her confused with the wildling character named Osha?
Seems House of the Dragon, which has a brain-twister in the making between Rhaenyra and Rhaenys here, isn’t too concerned about that.)
House of the Dragon—which has many more yet-to-be-glimpsed characters, including but not limited to the dragons of its title—premieres August 21 on HBO Max.

     ‘Game of Thrones’ Prequel Series ‘House of the Dragon’ to Debut in August
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “House of the Dragon,” HBO’s first spin-off series of its record-breaking juggernaut “Game of Thrones,” will premiere on Aug. 21, the network announced Wednesday.
HBO also revealed a new poster for the series and additional images from the show, which you can view below.
Set two centuries before the events of “Game of Thrones,” the ten-episode prequel series will depict how the House of Targaryen fell into a bitter and brutal civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons — presaging the beginning of the end of the ruling family of Westeros.
In February, Martin announced on his personal blog that shooting on Season 1 of “House of the Dragon” had wrapped.
“I have seen rough cuts of a few of them, and I’m loving them,” Martin wrote.
