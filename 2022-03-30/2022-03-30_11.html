     The 2022 Rolex Air-King Feels Like No Other Rolex
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We're on the ground in Geneva, Switzerland, covering Watches &amp; Wonders — the biggest watch event of the year.
With a couple of deft tweaks, Rolex has given an overlooked model new life.
Keep in mind, it's not every year the Rolex refreshes a collection with changes this significant.
The Air-King has always been polarizing, and this new model will likely remain so.
But with a sportier case and all-around upgrades, the Air-King should have a significantly broader appeal than its predecessor.

     Rolex’s Biggest Release of 2022 Is…
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the Watches &amp; Wonders trade show in Geneva brings an avalanche of new pieces from nearly every watchmaker on the planet, none are quite as eagerly anticipated as the Crown’s.
This is despite the fact that Rolex moves at a glacial pace, tweaking sizes or swapping out bracelets and occasionally resurfacing old models.
Here's the big news from the brand at the biggest watch show on earth.
Today, as part of the industry trade show Watches &amp; Wonders, Rolex is showing off a new GMT with a brand new color combination: green and black.
The crown and the date window have both been flipped to the left side of the case.

     Introducing The Rolex GMT-Master II Ref. 126720VTNR: A Left-Handed Model With A Green And Black Bezel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: These two vintage lefties did technically establish a destro precedent (one further bolstered by the existence of left-handed Cellini and Submariner models).
So why's it so hard to believe this new GMT exists?
Because it feels very unlike modern Rolex to produce such a peculiar watch with such niche appeal.
As Jack has written before, only about 10 percent of the human population is left-handed, which is why most watches have the crown on the right – for ease of use by the masses.
And yet here we are.

     First review of what’s new from Rolex
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul Altieri loves Rolex so much he built a business around his passion for collecting the company’s watches.
It is known that Rolex produced left-handed watches in very small numbers as early as the 1950’s, but more than likely by special request.
Rolex has been offering the 42mm Yacht Master in only white gold, which has been a terrific seller for us.
It doesn’t come as a huge surprise that Rolex expanded the 42mm Yacht-Master family by adding another metal type – yellow gold.
Rolex will now only be offering the Tiffany Blue and green dial in 31mm and 36mm sizes.

     Rolex Just Unveiled Its New Watches for 2022, Including a New Air-King and a GMT-Master II
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fervid speculation over what Rolex would announce at Watches &amp; Wonders—now an annual ritual amongst the global watch community—is finally at an end.
Rolex Oyster Perpetual Air-KingRolex brought the Air-King back in 2016 after a short hiatus—and speculation about when it would get another update has been rife ever since.
Like the new Air-King, the new Oyster Perpetual also benefits from the legibility-boosting optimized Chromalight display and the manufacture’s newly developed luminescent material.
Like the larger Yacht-Master also introduced today, it also has Rolex’s new Oysterflex bracelet and folding safety clasp improving wearability.

     New Air-King With Crown Guards and Green and Black Left-Handed GMT-Master II Headline Rolex's 2022 Releases
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Headlining the new releases is the long-rumored green and black left-handed GMT-Master II, taking on a new color option on its 24-hour Cerachrom bezel with a classic black dial to join the ranks of other icons such as the Pepsi and Coke.
Accompanying the GMT-Master II in the spotlight for this release is the all-new Air-King, its 40mm case now including new crown guards.
Not much has changed in regards to its aviation-inspired black dial, but its movement has been updated with the calibre 3230, first released in 2020.
An 18k yellow gold option will now be available in 42mm for the first time, while the previously-released white gold option in the same size will now carry a falcon’s eye dial.
Materials range from Oystersteel to platinum, white gold, yellow gold and Everose gold with some more luxurious models carrying diamond embellishments.
