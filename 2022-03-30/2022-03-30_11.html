     Lauren London Pays Tribute To Nipsey Hussle On 3rd Anniversary Of Rapper's Death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Thursday (March 31) serving as the three-year anniversary of Nipsey Hussle’s death, his longtime girlfriend Lauren London paid tribute to the late Los Angeles icon with a touching Instagram post.
“Long Live The King Ermias Asghedom Hussle Man.”London and Neighborhood Nip began dating in 2013 and had one child together named Kross Asghedom in 2016.
Nipsey Hussle — born Ermias Asghedom — was shot and killed outside his Marathon Clothing Store in Los Angeles on March 31, 2019 at 33 years old.
Nip’s brother, Blacc Sam, insists the only way a posthumous Hussle album would be released would be alongside an official documentary.
Following his death, Nipsey Hussle went on to win two Grammy Awards for his contributions to “Racks in the Middle” alongside Hit-Boy and Roddy Ricch for Best Rap Performance in 2020 and DJ Khaled’s “Higher” for Best Rap/Sung Performance.

     Watch: See Nipsey Hussle Murals in LA – NBC Los Angeles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thursday marks three years since the killing of LA rap artist and activist Nipsey Hussle, who was shot March 31, 2019 at age 33 outside his clothing store.
The young star's message and legacy can still be seen throughout LA, where dozens of murals portray his likeness.
As a young man, Douglas had "seen where he was headed -- he was looking for acceptance," which he says often leads to gang involvement.
"I watched him grow from a young man to a man," he said.
The LA County coroner would later find one bullet went into his skull and another into his spine, severing it.
