     Bruins sign goalie Brandon Bussi from Western Michigan to amateur tryout agreement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins have bolstered their organizational goaltending depth for next season.
The team announced Wednesday it had signed Brandon Bussi, most recently with Western Michigan University, to a one-year, entry-level contract for the 2022-23 season at a cap hit of $825,000.
The 23-year-old netminder will spend the remainder of this season with AHL Providence on an amateur tryout agreement (ATO).
Over 77 career games at Western Michigan, Bussi was 46-25-5 with a 2.61 goals against average and .910 save percentage.
Svedeback was the first goalie Boston had drafted since current starter Jeremy Swayman (fourth round, 111th overall) in 2017.

     Boston Bruins Hall Fined $5000 For Gloved Punch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a contentious Atlantic Division rivalry game between the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday night, and both sides have the bruises to show for it.
In fact, Boston Bruins winger Taylor Hall was hit with some supplementary discipline from the league for the exchange with Lyubushkin.
Hall was fined $5,000 by the NHL Department of Player Safety on Wednesday morning for “roughing” Lyubushkin after getting thrown face-first into the side boards.
Lyubushkin immediately went down to the ice and was helped back to the Maple Leafs dressing where he never returned to the win for the Maple Leafs.
We were told nobody likes to receive a hit like that and we got the same hit [on Hall],” said Boston Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And of course, the Florida Panthers took down the defending Stanley Cup runners-up, the Montreal Canadi—oh, what’s that?
Aside from the Mrazek injury, which was nobody’s fault, the Leafs also lost a pair of defensemen, Justin Holl and Ilya Lyubushkin, during the second period.
More blatantly shitty was Taylor Hall’s retaliatory punch from behind on Lyubushkin after the Bruins forward got checked down by the boards.
Brad Marchand, who’s normally so self-possessed, got a misconduct penalty for something he said to the officials at the end of the second period after a confrontation with Leafs captain John Tavares.
They’ve done all right for themselves so far this season, winning 5-2 in November and then getting the two points on Tuesday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NESN Logo Sign InBruins head coach Bruce Cassidy indicated Boston’s lineup could be dealt a shuffle following Tuesday’s loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs.
Cassidy noted Wednesday how any potential lineup change would be done in order to keep players who haven’t played recently motivated.
The Bruins next take the ice Thursday against the New Jersey Devils, and it feels like the defense will be where any potential change occurs.
With Cassidy wanting to move some players into the lineup who haven’t played in some time, the first name that comes to mind is Reilly.
Reilly, however, after seeing how he played in a playoff push last season, could provide the Bruins a spark.

Standing at the point, Clifton one-timed a pass shuttled his way from Taylor Hall on the near half-wall.
There was a good offensive play for Clifton to make there, noted Cassidy, and it wasn’t to launch a rocket that Kerfoot caught.
