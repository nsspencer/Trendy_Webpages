     Elliot Page Returns to Umbrella Academy as Viktor Hargreeves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As Season Three of Umbrella Academy wraps, the cast and production have revealed that Elliot Page, who uses both he and they pronouns, is returning to the show as Viktor Hargreeves.
Previously p laying a character named Vanya, the change comes in the wake of Page’s own announcement of their transgender identity, and was very likely done to reflect Page’s own transition.
AdvertisementAs a transgender nerd, I cannot overstate how thrilled I am to see this kind of change happen.
The embrace of Page’s identity will make it easier for Page to land new roles in the future and will help bring more trans people into Hollywood as actors first and trans people second.
At the end of the day, Page deserves to take roles and work on productions that will honor, even celebrate, his gender identity.
