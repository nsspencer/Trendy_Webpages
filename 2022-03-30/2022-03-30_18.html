     Samantha Markle slams ‘ridiculous’ Prince Harry for missing Prince Philip’s memorial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Samantha Markle slams ‘ridiculous’ Prince Harry for missing Prince Philip’s memorialPrince Harry has been dubbed ‘ridiculous’ by Samantha Markle for missing Prince Philip’s memorial over a security bidSamantha, the half-sister of Harry's wife Meghan Markle, made this accusation in her interview with the Daily Star.
There she was quoted saying, “He should have hired more of his own security, they live a lavish lifestyle, they can afford security, it's ridiculous.”“Security for a weekend of something is not that expensive and I'm pretty sure they have security now.
It would be so easy for him to pay for his own security.”This claim comes shortly after Prince Harry’s team explained how private security would never be able to provide security similar to that of the UK state.
In the eyes of Samantha, it is “mind-boggling” that Harry would put security issues beyond his obligation to the late Prince Philip.
“Especially now for this memorial and after everything that transpired and Prince Philip seemed to have a rough time in his last days watching the Royal Family being attacked by Meghan and Harry.”“Maybe Harry feels bad about that but it seems the least he could do would be to show up, pay respect and try to if he and Meghan are humanitarians, to show up humbly and pay respects and show some remorse at a minimum.”“Not to mention the fact, Prince Philip was his grandfather but Harry has been in service, Prince Philip served in World War Two, not only to honour him as his grandfather but also a military figure, who is noted for great service is highly disrespectful.”Before concluding she added, “To put something as petty as security ahead of the obvious ethical, humane military and royal respect, it doesn't make sense, it's sad.”

     England news: Harry Kane, Jordan Henderson fire stern message at Three Lions fans who booed Harry Maguire at Wembley
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: England cruised to a convincing 3-0 victory over Ivory Coast on Tuesday at Wembley Stadium, but the flurry of boos that rained down on defender Harry Maguire stole the spotlight.
While Maguire is a mainstay with Gareth Southgate’s side, his form has been poor at the club level with United this term.
This is what Harry Kane and Jordan Henderson had to say:The fact that he’s been brilliant on the pitch and given us all so many great memories makes it even harder to understand.
— Harry Kane (@HKane) March 30, 2022This is a bad look for England fans, who also racially abused Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Bukayo Saka after the Euro 2020 final.
Instead of reacting to the boos, Maguire simply tweeted this after the win:Enjoyable week playing for my country 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤️ pic.twitter.com/8oHZiOlhpe — Harry Maguire (@HarryMaguire93) March 30, 2022Class.

The Duke of Cambridge has reportedly decided not to invite his younger brother, or Meghan Markle, to his milestone 40th birthday party over the summer.
“I was trapped, but I didn’t know I was trapped,” Harry said at the time.

     Summary: The two-year anniversary of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's departure from social media occurred on Wednesday, with the couple last posting to their official @sussexroyal Instagram account in March 2020.
Before her marriage to Harry, Meghan ran successful social media accounts across various platforms including Instagram and her blog, The Tig.
When a story was published by The Times in January 2021 stating that "Harry and Meghan quit social media" for good, the prince disputed it.
"The truth is, despite its well-documented ills, social media can offer a means of connecting and community, which are vital to us as human beings."
Now two years on from their initial stepping away from social media, Harry and Meghan are working to communicate through other forms of digital media, including their multi-million dollar contract with Netflix to produce video content.

     Summary: Harry Maguire: anatomy of a booing.
But it was perhaps a factor in the booing, which didn’t, to a long-term booing observer, feel quite the same as other booing in the past.
Drown out the noise and the suggestion that Maguire doesn’t deserve to be playing for England is also nonsensical.
Maguire has played 14 England games since October 2020, with 12 wins, no defeats, 10 clean sheets and also six (yes really: six) England goals.
But the booing of Maguire feels like a false flag, learned behaviour, TV distraction.

Rather strangely, his employers were also quick to voice their solidarity with Maguire, tweeting: “No player deserves abuse.
I was impressed at his command of the English language, but judging from the amount of twaddle he’s been spouting [about a revamped Big Cup] this week he must just have had an exceptional subeditor.
