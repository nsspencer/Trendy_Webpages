     Summary: No watching the World Cup from the couch this time.
Canada and Mexico also qualified, while Costa Rica will go to a one-game playoff in June against a team from Oceania.
Costa Rica, meanwhile, rested several key players who had yellow cards, not wanting to risk them picking up another and being suspended for the playoff.
The score won't matter when the World Cup kicks off, only that the United States is there.
The World Cup begins Nov. 21 and will be played over four weeks at eight stadiums across Qatar.

     Costa Rica 2, USA 0: USMNT still qualifies for World Cup (VIDEO)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The result did extend the U.S.’s run of futility playing in Costa Rica, where it fell to 0-10-2 all-time, and 0-10-1 in qualifying.
Costa Rica had a dangerous moment seeking the opener in the 29th minute.
After all of the missed opportunities on set pieces the U.S. had, Costa Rica opened the scoring on one of its own.
His first-time follow was on target but blocked before it could hit the goal, as Costa Rica desperately defended its goal to preserve the lead.
Costa Rica never threatened to ramp up the pressure from that point on, though, with the U.S. seeing out the result—and ultimately punching its ticket back to the World Cup.

     Summary: The reporter posing the question was wondering whether DeAndre Yedlin ’s younger teammates had queried him about his experiences of the US men’s national team ’s doomed 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign.
But I'm pretty good at putting things in the past,” he said with a smile.
But I think the excitement and just the proud feeling for this group is going to overtake any personal feelings for me.
Yedlin is the only member of the current pool who’s played in a World Cup.
So it's just about, again, focusing on what we need to do to make sure when you guys write that headline, it says the US is going to the World Cup.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tyler Adams called it a brotherhood when he spoke to the media on a zoom call ahead of the United State heading to San Jose, Costa Rica.
"Jurgen Klinsmann had a project to unearth talent around the world that had American roots.
While ten current players on the roster play in MLS now, 16 of the initial 28 called up got their start either in the league or team's youth systems.
The fact that the team has built these connections that mean something, even when players aren't there, is notable.
But again, it's good to have more guys that are able to come in and play pivotal roles in our team."
