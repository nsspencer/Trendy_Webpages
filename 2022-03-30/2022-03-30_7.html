     Biden warns U.S. won't have enough Covid vaccine shots this fall if Congress fails to pass funding

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. President Joe Biden receives a second coranavirus disease (COVID-19) booster vaccination after delivering remarks on COVID-19 in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building’s South Court Auditorium at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 30, 2022.
President Joe Biden warned Wednesday that the U.S. will not have enough Covid vaccine shots this fall to ensure free and easy access for all Americans if Congress fails to pass the $22.5 billion in additional funding the administration has requested.
Biden said the U.S. has enough supply to ensure people eligible for fourth shots have access to them.
Biden, 79, received his fourth dose on live television after his remarks.
Congress please act.

But a Facebook post claims that photos taken during the event didn’t actually happen on March 29.

Then Biden swiftly turned his remarks towards asking Congress for more money to continue the effort to halt the coronavirus pandemic.
“Just as we’ve reached a critical turning point in this fight, Congress has to provide the funding America needs to continue to fight Covid-19,” he said.
“It didn’t hurt a bit,” Biden said of the shot, apologizing if the sight of a needle going into his arm had “discouraged” anybody from taking the vaccine.

     Summary: Biden pressed lawmakers to provide additional funding “immediately” to ensure continued supply of the tools that have helped the nation begin to emerge from the pandemic.
“Congress, we need to secure additional supply now,” he said, warning of shortages of vaccines, tests and treatments.
“This isn’t partisan, it’s medicine.”Biden, 79, received the first series of two doses of the coronavirus vaccine shortly before taking office and a first booster shot in September.
The additional booster dose was administered by a member of the White House Medical Unit.
But it doesn’t seem to cause more severe disease than the original, and vaccines appear just as effective against it.

     Summary: This didn’t really square with what anyone knew about Biden’s history, but this was what was sold.
The shift from Trump to Biden would be “day and night, black and white,” one veteran diplomat assured the public.
But it’s just the worst of a series of alarming verbal slipups Biden’s made since the crisis began late last year.
(A White House official quickly explained Biden was merely talking about “Ukrainian soldiers in Poland interacting on a regular basis with US troops.”)Incredibly, some have actually tried to defend all this.
Administration officials have continually explained Biden’s slipups as being driven by a supposedly emotional response to meeting refugees and seeing firsthand the impacts of Putin’s war.

He also testified that, because he was lying about his lack of contacts with Russia, Trump was subject to blackmail by Putin, had Putin any reason to break with Trump.

“She gave him $3.5 million, so now I would think Putin would know the answer to that.
Trump's remarks in Tuesday's interview come shortly after GOP lawmakers urged President Biden to more forcefully punish Putin for waging war on Ukraine, only to have Trump praise Putin.
“I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, ‘This is genius.’ Putin declares a big portion of Ukraine — Putin declares it as independent.
“Just when you thought it couldn’t get worse, Joe Biden totally failed to deter Russia’s disgraceful invasion of Ukraine,” Trump said Saturday.

     Summary: President Joe Biden rolls up his sleeve before receiving his second COVID-19 booster shot in the South Court Auditorium on the White House campus, Wednesday, March 30, 2022, in Washington.
The White House says the initiative has so far expanded to more than 2,000 locations across the nation.
There have been discussions within the White House about the possibility of Biden discussing the state of the pandemic for a number of weeks, according to a source familiar.
Last week, White House response coordinator Jeff Zients warned that second Covid-19 booster shots would not be free and readily available to the public without additional funding.
But funding from Congress is key to moving into that new stage, White House officials stress.
