     Biden planning to tap oil reserve to control gas prices
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: High oil prices have not coaxed more production, creating a challenge for Biden.
Crude oil on Wednesday traded at nearly $105 a barrel, up from about $60 a year ago.
Still, oil producers have been more focused on meeting the needs of investors, according to a survey released last week by the Dallas Federal Reserve.
The Biden administration in November announced the release of 50 million barrels from the strategic reserve in coordination with other countries.
According to the Department of Energy, which manages it, more than 568 million barrels of oil were held in the reserve as of Mar.

     Biden considering releasing 1 million barrels of oil per day from strategic reserves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) President Joe Biden is weighing releasing a record amount of oil from US reserves as high gas prices persist.
A plan being considered involves releasing around 1 million barrels per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the coming months, a person familiar with the deliberations says.
The announcement could come as soon as Thursday, when Biden is scheduled to deliver remarks from the White House on gas prices.
Biden earlier in the month announced a coordinated release of oil from the reserves in conjunction with other nations.
He also released around 60 million barrels in November , which he said at the time was the largest release from the reserve in US history.

Then Biden swiftly turned his remarks towards asking Congress for more money to continue the effort to halt the coronavirus pandemic.
“Just as we’ve reached a critical turning point in this fight, Congress has to provide the funding America needs to continue to fight Covid-19,” he said.
“It didn’t hurt a bit,” Biden said of the shot, apologizing if the sight of a needle going into his arm had “discouraged” anybody from taking the vaccine.

     Summary: Biden pressed lawmakers to provide additional funding “immediately” to ensure continued supply of the tools that have helped the nation begin to emerge from the pandemic.
“Congress, we need to secure additional supply now,” he said, warning of shortages of vaccines, tests and treatments.
“This isn’t partisan, it’s medicine.”Biden, 79, received the first series of two doses of the coronavirus vaccine shortly before taking office and a first booster shot in September.
The additional booster dose was administered by a member of the White House Medical Unit.
But it doesn’t seem to cause more severe disease than the original, and vaccines appear just as effective against it.

     Summary: This didn’t really square with what anyone knew about Biden’s history, but this was what was sold.
The shift from Trump to Biden would be “day and night, black and white,” one veteran diplomat assured the public.
But it’s just the worst of a series of alarming verbal slipups Biden’s made since the crisis began late last year.
(A White House official quickly explained Biden was merely talking about “Ukrainian soldiers in Poland interacting on a regular basis with US troops.”)Incredibly, some have actually tried to defend all this.
Administration officials have continually explained Biden’s slipups as being driven by a supposedly emotional response to meeting refugees and seeing firsthand the impacts of Putin’s war.

Trump is going farther, alleging not only that Hunter Biden did get this money, but that his father did, too.

He also testified that, because he was lying about his lack of contacts with Russia, Trump was subject to blackmail by Putin, had Putin any reason to break with Trump.
