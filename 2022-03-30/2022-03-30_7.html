     Biden considering releasing 1 million barrels of oil per day from strategic reserves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) President Joe Biden is weighing releasing a record amount of oil from US reserves as high gas prices persist.
A plan being considered involves releasing around 1 million barrels per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the coming months, a person familiar with the deliberations says.
The announcement could come as soon as Thursday, when Biden is scheduled to deliver remarks from the White House on gas prices.
Biden earlier in the month announced a coordinated release of oil from the reserves in conjunction with other nations.
He also released around 60 million barrels in November , which he said at the time was the largest release from the reserve in US history.

     Biden planning to tap oil reserve to control gas prices
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: High oil prices have not coaxed more production, creating a challenge for Biden.
Crude oil on Wednesday traded at nearly $105 a barrel, up from about $60 a year ago.
Still, oil producers have been more focused on meeting the needs of investors, according to a survey released last week by the Dallas Federal Reserve.
The Biden administration in November announced the release of 50 million barrels from the strategic reserve in coordination with other countries.
According to the Department of Energy, which manages it, more than 568 million barrels of oil were held in the reserve as of Mar.
