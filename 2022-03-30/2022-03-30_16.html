     Summary: Royal photographer has lambasted Prince Harry for missing Prince Philip’s memorial service for 'lame excuse'.
Arthur Edwards, who has been photographing the Royal Family for The Sun since 1977 explained how Prince Harry had 'lost out'.
Arthur said: “Royals young and old came from far and wide to Westminster Abbey yesterday to pay tribute to Prince Philip – except one.
“Prince Harry’s excuse for avoiding the memorial service for his own grandfather because of “security fears” is, quite frankly, lame.
As far as I’m concerned, after yesterday’s no-show Harry has burnt his boats, " teh royal photographer said.

Prince Harry did not attend the service for his grandfather and now the Duke of Edinburgh‘s former protection officer is sounding off on the Duke of Sussex‘s “pathetic excuse” for not being there.
However, many thought Prince Harry would travel and be in attendance; that is until he announced otherwise.
“Imagine missing your mentor grandfather’s memorial service because you’re such a spoiled brat you’d rather sulk in your Californian mansion than be there to support your grandmother?

     Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Have Been Off Social Media for Two Years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The two-year anniversary of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's departure from social media occurred on Wednesday, with the couple last posting to their official @sussexroyal Instagram account in March 2020.
Before her marriage to Harry, Meghan ran successful social media accounts across various platforms including Instagram and her blog, The Tig.
When a story was published by The Times in January 2021 stating that "Harry and Meghan quit social media" for good, the prince disputed it.
"The truth is, despite its well-documented ills, social media can offer a means of connecting and community, which are vital to us as human beings."
Now two years on from their initial stepping away from social media, Harry and Meghan are working to communicate through other forms of digital media, including their multi-million dollar contract with Netflix to produce video content.

     Prince Harry looks 'petulant and rude' for skipping Philip's memorial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be aware that missing the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service for Prince Philip has made them look 'petulant and rude,' a royal expert has claimed.
Prince Harry, 37 and Meghan Markle, 40, were notable in their absence as the Queen, 95, senior royals, politicians, European royals and friends gathered in Westminster Abbey to pay tribute to Prince Philip.
Prince Harry was the only major royal figure not to attend Prince Philip's memorial service on Tuesday.
However, royal biographer Angela Levin questioned whether Harry will ever recognise his 'appalling behaviour' after being the only major royal figure not to attend Philip's memorial service.
Royal author Phil Dampier told MailOnline ahead of the event: 'It's very sad that Harry and Meghan won't be at Prince Philip's memorial service and I think one day Harry might regret it.
