     Harry Styles shares visual teaser for new single, “As It Was” – 97.9 WRMF
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyIt appears we might get not only a new song from Harry Styles this week — we might get a brand-new music video, too!
In the new clip, Harry sits on the floor as he spins as if on an invisible record player, then looks directly at the camera before the screen cuts to black.
The nine-second clip doesn’t tease any lyrics, but it does reveal the tempo and a bit of the song’s apparently upbeat melody.
“As It Was,” which comes out April 1, is the first single from the singer’s forthcoming album, Harry’s House.
The album, which is the followup to 2019’s Fine Line, is now available for pre-save and will hit stores on May 20.

Arthur said: “Royals young and old came from far and wide to Westminster Abbey yesterday to pay tribute to Prince Philip – except one.
“Prince Harry’s excuse for avoiding the memorial service for his own grandfather because of “security fears” is, quite frankly, lame.
As far as I’m concerned, after yesterday’s no-show Harry has burnt his boats, " teh royal photographer said.

The Duke of Cambridge has reportedly decided not to invite his younger brother, or Meghan Markle, to his milestone 40th birthday party over the summer.
“I was trapped, but I didn’t know I was trapped,” Harry said at the time.

     Summary: England cruised to a convincing 3-0 victory over Ivory Coast on Tuesday at Wembley Stadium, but the flurry of boos that rained down on defender Harry Maguire stole the spotlight.
While Maguire is a mainstay with Gareth Southgate’s side, his form has been poor at the club level with United this term.
This is what Harry Kane and Jordan Henderson had to say:The fact that he’s been brilliant on the pitch and given us all so many great memories makes it even harder to understand.
— Harry Kane (@HKane) March 30, 2022This is a bad look for England fans, who also racially abused Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Bukayo Saka after the Euro 2020 final.
Instead of reacting to the boos, Maguire simply tweeted this after the win:Enjoyable week playing for my country 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤️ pic.twitter.com/8oHZiOlhpe — Harry Maguire (@HarryMaguire93) March 30, 2022Class.

     Summary: The two-year anniversary of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's departure from social media occurred on Wednesday, with the couple last posting to their official @sussexroyal Instagram account in March 2020.
Before her marriage to Harry, Meghan ran successful social media accounts across various platforms including Instagram and her blog, The Tig.
When a story was published by The Times in January 2021 stating that "Harry and Meghan quit social media" for good, the prince disputed it.
"The truth is, despite its well-documented ills, social media can offer a means of connecting and community, which are vital to us as human beings."
Now two years on from their initial stepping away from social media, Harry and Meghan are working to communicate through other forms of digital media, including their multi-million dollar contract with Netflix to produce video content.

     Summary: Harry Maguire: anatomy of a booing.
But it was perhaps a factor in the booing, which didn’t, to a long-term booing observer, feel quite the same as other booing in the past.
Drown out the noise and the suggestion that Maguire doesn’t deserve to be playing for England is also nonsensical.
Maguire has played 14 England games since October 2020, with 12 wins, no defeats, 10 clean sheets and also six (yes really: six) England goals.
But the booing of Maguire feels like a false flag, learned behaviour, TV distraction.

Rather strangely, his employers were also quick to voice their solidarity with Maguire, tweeting: “No player deserves abuse.
I was impressed at his command of the English language, but judging from the amount of twaddle he’s been spouting [about a revamped Big Cup] this week he must just have had an exceptional subeditor.

     Summary: Brooklyn is set to wed actress Nicola Peltz, 27, on April 9 at her family’s oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, a short flight from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's $14 million Californian home.
David, 46, and Victoria, 47, are good friends with Prince Harry, 38, and Meghan, 40, even attending their nuptials at Windsor Castle in May 2018.
In February 2020, the former professional footballer spoke about how 'he's proud' of his 'amazing' friend Prince Harry following his marriage to Meghan and the birth of their son, Archie.
Meanwhile it emerged later that year that Prince Harry and Meghan hired David and Victoria's highly-rated former aide to join their Los Angeles team.
Speculation has mounted as Prince Harry faced criticism for missing Prince Philip's memorial service yesterday.
