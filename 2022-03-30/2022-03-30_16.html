     Harry Styles shares visual teaser for new single, “As It Was” – 97.9 WRMF
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyIt appears we might get not only a new song from Harry Styles this week — we might get a brand-new music video, too!
In the new clip, Harry sits on the floor as he spins as if on an invisible record player, then looks directly at the camera before the screen cuts to black.
The nine-second clip doesn’t tease any lyrics, but it does reveal the tempo and a bit of the song’s apparently upbeat melody.
“As It Was,” which comes out April 1, is the first single from the singer’s forthcoming album, Harry’s House.
The album, which is the followup to 2019’s Fine Line, is now available for pre-save and will hit stores on May 20.

     Summary: Royal photographer has lambasted Prince Harry for missing Prince Philip’s memorial service for 'lame excuse'.
Arthur Edwards, who has been photographing the Royal Family for The Sun since 1977 explained how Prince Harry had 'lost out'.
Arthur said: “Royals young and old came from far and wide to Westminster Abbey yesterday to pay tribute to Prince Philip – except one.
“Prince Harry’s excuse for avoiding the memorial service for his own grandfather because of “security fears” is, quite frankly, lame.
As far as I’m concerned, after yesterday’s no-show Harry has burnt his boats, " teh royal photographer said.

     Summary: Just about every member of the British royal family turned out for Prince Philip‘s memorial service.
Prince Harry did not attend the service for his grandfather and now the Duke of Edinburgh‘s former protection officer is sounding off on the Duke of Sussex‘s “pathetic excuse” for not being there.
However, many thought Prince Harry would travel and be in attendance; that is until he announced otherwise.
“Imagine missing your mentor grandfather’s memorial service because you’re such a spoiled brat you’d rather sulk in your Californian mansion than be there to support your grandmother?

     Summary: Harry Styles is spinning right ’round baby, right ’round, like a record baby, right ’round.
Styles first announced the single — his first since 2019 — on Monday (March 28), just a few days after he gave word that his third studio album Harry’s House is on its way.
The May 20-slated album will have 13 tracks, more than either of his past two full length projects.
The Twitter page has been posting cryptic messages for weeks, which are seemingly bits and pieces of lyrics to Harry’s House songs.

     Summary: The two-year anniversary of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's departure from social media occurred on Wednesday, with the couple last posting to their official @sussexroyal Instagram account in March 2020.
Before her marriage to Harry, Meghan ran successful social media accounts across various platforms including Instagram and her blog, The Tig.
When a story was published by The Times in January 2021 stating that "Harry and Meghan quit social media" for good, the prince disputed it.
"The truth is, despite its well-documented ills, social media can offer a means of connecting and community, which are vital to us as human beings."
Now two years on from their initial stepping away from social media, Harry and Meghan are working to communicate through other forms of digital media, including their multi-million dollar contract with Netflix to produce video content.

Another source previously told In Touch that Olivia “is giving this relationship all she can because she truly wants to make it work.
“Olivia and Harry are both working on projects, and Harry has a million things going on.
“Harry and Olivia have something special, and they know it.”While the couple are extremely private, Harry did briefly touch upon his relationship in a November 2021 interview.
“I’ve always tried to compartmentalize my personal life and my working life,” the former member of One Direction told Dazed at the time.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harry Maguire: anatomy of a booing.
But it was perhaps a factor in the booing, which didn’t, to a long-term booing observer, feel quite the same as other booing in the past.
Drown out the noise and the suggestion that Maguire doesn’t deserve to be playing for England is also nonsensical.
Maguire has played 14 England games since October 2020, with 12 wins, no defeats, 10 clean sheets and also six (yes really: six) England goals.
But the booing of Maguire feels like a false flag, learned behaviour, TV distraction.

The Duke of Cambridge has reportedly decided not to invite his younger brother, or Meghan Markle, to his milestone 40th birthday party over the summer.
“I was trapped, but I didn’t know I was trapped,” Harry said at the time.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn is set to wed actress Nicola Peltz, 27, on April 9 at her family’s oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, a short flight from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's $14 million Californian home.
David, 46, and Victoria, 47, are good friends with Prince Harry, 38, and Meghan, 40, even attending their nuptials at Windsor Castle in May 2018.
In February 2020, the former professional footballer spoke about how 'he's proud' of his 'amazing' friend Prince Harry following his marriage to Meghan and the birth of their son, Archie.
Meanwhile it emerged later that year that Prince Harry and Meghan hired David and Victoria's highly-rated former aide to join their Los Angeles team.
Speculation has mounted as Prince Harry faced criticism for missing Prince Philip's memorial service yesterday.
