     Bruins sign goalie Brandon Bussi from Western Michigan to amateur tryout agreement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins have bolstered their organizational goaltending depth for next season.
The team announced Wednesday it had signed Brandon Bussi, most recently with Western Michigan University, to a one-year, entry-level contract for the 2022-23 season at a cap hit of $825,000.
The 23-year-old netminder will spend the remainder of this season with AHL Providence on an amateur tryout agreement (ATO).
Over 77 career games at Western Michigan, Bussi was 46-25-5 with a 2.61 goals against average and .910 save percentage.
Svedeback was the first goalie Boston had drafted since current starter Jeremy Swayman (fourth round, 111th overall) in 2017.

     Does The Lord Love Us Enough To Give Us Another Leafs-Bruins Series?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And of course, the Florida Panthers took down the defending Stanley Cup runners-up, the Montreal Canadi—oh, what’s that?
Aside from the Mrazek injury, which was nobody’s fault, the Leafs also lost a pair of defensemen, Justin Holl and Ilya Lyubushkin, during the second period.
More blatantly shitty was Taylor Hall’s retaliatory punch from behind on Lyubushkin after the Bruins forward got checked down by the boards.
Brad Marchand, who’s normally so self-possessed, got a misconduct penalty for something he said to the officials at the end of the second period after a confrontation with Leafs captain John Tavares.
They’ve done all right for themselves so far this season, winning 5-2 in November and then getting the two points on Tuesday.

     Boston Bruins Hall Fined $5000 For Gloved Punch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a contentious Atlantic Division rivalry game between the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday night, and both sides have the bruises to show for it.
In fact, Boston Bruins winger Taylor Hall was hit with some supplementary discipline from the league for the exchange with Lyubushkin.
Hall was fined $5,000 by the NHL Department of Player Safety on Wednesday morning for “roughing” Lyubushkin after getting thrown face-first into the side boards.
Lyubushkin immediately went down to the ice and was helped back to the Maple Leafs dressing where he never returned to the win for the Maple Leafs.
We were told nobody likes to receive a hit like that and we got the same hit [on Hall],” said Boston Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy.

Clifton botched a pass to Matt Grzelcyk that led to Toronto’s first goal, and messed up on the play that led to Alexander Kerfoot’s breakaway for the 3-1 lead.
There was a good offensive play for Clifton to make there, noted Cassidy, and it wasn’t to launch a rocket that Kerfoot caught.
“If you watch that play,” said Cassidy, “David Pastrnak is at the near post by himself; the [Leafs] haven’t recovered yet.
