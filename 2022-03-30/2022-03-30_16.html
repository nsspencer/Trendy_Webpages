Although it was thought that they would be ‘burying the hatchet’ when they reunite for the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations this summer, one source is now claiming that William has decided against inviting Harry to his 40th birthday.
A source said: ‘William still loves Harry – that will never change – but his apparent insensitivity makes him persona non grata at the moment and it will take some miracle for that to change.
‘The feeling is that, even if Harry and Meghan decided to come to William’s celebration, and that is a big if, their presence would bring a whole fresh set of problems, and nobody wants that.
The sad truth is that William barely recognises, let alone relates to, his younger brother any more.’The Palace has not yet commented.

     Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Have Been Off Social Media for Two Years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The two-year anniversary of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's departure from social media occurred on Wednesday, with the couple last posting to their official @sussexroyal Instagram account in March 2020.
Before her marriage to Harry, Meghan ran successful social media accounts across various platforms including Instagram and her blog, The Tig.
When a story was published by The Times in January 2021 stating that "Harry and Meghan quit social media" for good, the prince disputed it.
"The truth is, despite its well-documented ills, social media can offer a means of connecting and community, which are vital to us as human beings."
Now two years on from their initial stepping away from social media, Harry and Meghan are working to communicate through other forms of digital media, including their multi-million dollar contract with Netflix to produce video content.

     Summary: Brooklyn is set to wed actress Nicola Peltz, 27, on April 9 at her family’s oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, a short flight from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's $14 million Californian home.
David, 46, and Victoria, 47, are good friends with Prince Harry, 38, and Meghan, 40, even attending their nuptials at Windsor Castle in May 2018.
In February 2020, the former professional footballer spoke about how 'he's proud' of his 'amazing' friend Prince Harry following his marriage to Meghan and the birth of their son, Archie.
Meanwhile it emerged later that year that Prince Harry and Meghan hired David and Victoria's highly-rated former aide to join their Los Angeles team.
Speculation has mounted as Prince Harry faced criticism for missing Prince Philip's memorial service yesterday.
