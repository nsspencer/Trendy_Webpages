    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA–As the Philadelphia 76ers look to move on from their loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday at home, they have seven games left in the regular season to figure it all out.
The Sixers are not on that level yet and that is going to be a potential issue in the playoffs.
With seven games left, they have to do a lot in order to get the job done when it matters most.
“Get on the same page and as I said, everybody wants to,” Rivers added.
“When you start with that, you got a great chance of getting it done.”This post originally appeared on Sixers Wire!

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last time ESPN did its MVP straw poll, Joel Embiid held a narrow lead for No.

Nikola Jokic received 62 first-place votes and tallied 860 points, while Embiid garnered only 29 first-place votes and tallied 719 points.

For the season, Embiid is averaging 29.9 points, 11.4 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.4 blocks on .489/.364/.816 shooting splits.

     Summary: During the end of the third and start of the fourth quarter, the tides slowly began to change.
Most mentioned poor execution as a catalyst in their downfall and cited it as a key area of improvement in this final stretch of the regular season.
“Just a few execution things on both ends of the floor, offensively, defensively.
Mainly in that fourth quarter, we had a couple of lapses that led to open looks for them, and good looks that they converted on.
In the final quarter, Milwaukee outscored the Sixers 37-27 and shot 72.2% from the floor.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA — From the Sixers’ perspective, Tuesday’s 118-116 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks is perhaps in the eye of the beholder.
And after the game, Joel Embiid chose to focus on the five.“The game really changed when I went on the bench,” Embiid said.
Here’s the situation he’s referencing: Embiid went to the bench with 2:22 left in the third quarter and the Sixers leading 82-72.
James Harden would leave at the beginning of the fourth quarter with the Sixers still up 89-81.
Milwaukee went on a 12-2 run to start the fourth quarter, with Antetokounmpo scoring 15 straight points for the Bucks after Embiid left the game.

     Summary: Though I do have excitement and anticipation for the playoff run, my mind is fixated on Doc Rivers’ job security and how I believe it to be on the line with this upcoming postseason.
First off, let me give the Toronto Raptors credit for winning a game that was basically put through a meat grinder.
Now to the task at hand and that’s how the team fared in that Toronto loss and Rivers’ part in it.
It’s as if Doc Rivers is a business owner that continues to lose money but keeps the same business plan, prices, and so forth because he’s the owner who likes them.
With 7 games remaining, we shall find out what Doc Rivers decides the rotations are going to be.

     Summary: Two nights later, the Sixers returned to South Philly and faced their Eastern Conference rival, the Milwaukee Bucks, for the third time this year.
On Tuesday, when the Sixers welcomed the Bucks back to town, they attempted to get back in the winner’s column against the defending champions.
Like always, Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks issued the Sixers a problematic matchup.
In a rather rough quarter for the Sixers, Harden kept them alive as he scored 13 of their 28 third-quarter points.
Embiid scored eight points in nine minutes as the Bucks and the Sixers remained neck and neck throughout the third quarter.

     Summary: Playoff series are often decided by adjustments, then adjustments to those adjustments, and so on.
That’s not an indication that losing double-digit leads to the Suns and Bucks portends a pre-playoffs skid.
“We showed him some film of the Phoenix game and I think the Lakers game,” Rivers said.
He said, ‘I haven’t had a spot-up swing in … ever.’ So now he’s getting them and that’s good, because he’s a great shooter.
The Sixers aren’t a million miles from beating elite teams in seven-game series, but they’re aiming for many-faceted improvement.

     Summary: The Sixers have seven games left before the bright lights of the 2022 NBA Playoffs turn on.
There are still multiple variations of how the standings could play out over these next two weeks.
Before the two Eastern Conference heavyweights squared off, Doc Rivers was asked his thoughts on the close seeding race to close out the year.
No matter how things play out in these final games, the road to the NBA Finals through the East will be hard-fought no matter what.
Because of this, the Sixers are much better off using this time to best prepare themselves instead of worrying about the standings.
