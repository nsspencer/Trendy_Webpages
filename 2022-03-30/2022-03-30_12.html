     Country star Eric Church cancels San Antonio concert amid Final Four matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Gray News) - Some fans of country musician Eric Church are singing the blues.
Church’s San Antonio appearance Saturday, part of his “The Gather Again Tour,” has been canceled, Ticketmaster said.
The star is ditching this concert date to watch a Final Four game of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, also known as “March Madness,” Variety and other outlets reported.
Some fans on social media were predictably upset by the ruined concert plans, with one saying “Dude didn’t even reschedule.
Ticketmaster said fans should be able to get their refunds within 30 days.

“This is also the most selfish thing I’ve ever asked the Choir to do,” Church said, per a personal message from Ticketmaster shared on social media by fans, referencing his fanbase.
The two bluebloods will face off in the storied Final Four on Saturday at approximately 8:49 p.m.

     Country star Eric Church cancels show so he can watch UNC-Duke Final Four game, angers fans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Country star Eric Church upset some fans Tuesday when he announced he was canceling an upcoming tour date so he could attend an NCAA Final Four tournament match on the same night.
Church said he was canceling the date so that he could watch his beloved University of North Carolina men's basketball team face off against rival Duke University.
Church, who refers to his fans as the "Church choir," reportedly said giving up the show was the "most selfish" thing he could ask of them.
Located about 10 miles apart in North Carolina — Duke in Durham and UNC in Chapel Hill — the two elite basketball programs have a longstanding rivalry.
So for a few people who didn't have a stake in the concert, Church's choice to cancel the tour date was labeled "relatable and hilarious."

     UNC vs. Duke takes precedence over sold-out concert for country star Eric Church
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With an album titled "Carolina" and songs chock-full of lyrics reminiscing about the wonders of his hometown of Granite Falls, the country star has never been one to shy away from proclaiming loyalty to the state of North Carolina.
But Church's devotion never seemed to bother fans hailing from other locales until now.
Heck, to any devout college basketball fan, the choice likely seems reasonable.
But to a country music fan who already booked a flight and hired a babysitter for a chance to hear Church croon "Springsteen" and "Talladega" live?
The message sent via Ticketmaster to ticket holders was accompanied by an automatic refund notice.
