     Summary: Earlier this week, the HRC Foundation, in partnership with Civis Analytics, released Trans Lives &amp; Positive Visibility: How News &amp; Media Can Positively Cover Trans and Non-Binary Stories.
This report gives new insight into how media coverage and broader “visibility” can both affect society’s perception of the transgender community as a whole, as well as transgender individuals.
Transgender and non-binary people continue to face legislative and executive attacks across the United States.
Texas has become a flashpoint in recent months, with lawless, groundless attacks on transgender youth and their families by Texas Gov.
