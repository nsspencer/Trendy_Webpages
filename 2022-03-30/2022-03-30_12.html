     Summary: Jason Kempin/Getty ImagesMachine Gun Kelly says he had a moment with the late Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, just days before before his untimely passing.

“Taylor… went up to every single one of us and gave us each our moment,” said Kelly, adding that Hawkins didn’t miss a single person, not even Kelly’s assistant.
“I really want to thank him and let his kids know he made us feel — in a time where the outside world… is coming in hard on us — so confident in ourselves and loved.
Your father is a great, great man and we were all lucky to know him.”Hawkins, 50, was found dead in his hotel room Friday night in Bogota, Colombia, where the band was scheduled to perform at a festival.
