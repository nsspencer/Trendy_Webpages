     Boston Bruins Hall Fined $5000 For Gloved Punch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a contentious Atlantic Division rivalry game between the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday night, and both sides have the bruises to show for it.
In fact, Boston Bruins winger Taylor Hall was hit with some supplementary discipline from the league for the exchange with Lyubushkin.
Hall was fined $5,000 by the NHL Department of Player Safety on Wednesday morning for “roughing” Lyubushkin after getting thrown face-first into the side boards.
Lyubushkin immediately went down to the ice and was helped back to the Maple Leafs dressing where he never returned to the win for the Maple Leafs.
We were told nobody likes to receive a hit like that and we got the same hit [on Hall],” said Boston Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy.

     Does The Lord Love Us Enough To Give Us Another Leafs-Bruins Series?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And of course, the Florida Panthers took down the defending Stanley Cup runners-up, the Montreal Canadi—oh, what’s that?
Aside from the Mrazek injury, which was nobody’s fault, the Leafs also lost a pair of defensemen, Justin Holl and Ilya Lyubushkin, during the second period.
More blatantly shitty was Taylor Hall’s retaliatory punch from behind on Lyubushkin after the Bruins forward got checked down by the boards.
Brad Marchand, who’s normally so self-possessed, got a misconduct penalty for something he said to the officials at the end of the second period after a confrontation with Leafs captain John Tavares.
They’ve done all right for themselves so far this season, winning 5-2 in November and then getting the two points on Tuesday.

If you were not able to watch Tuesday’s game against the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins you missed out on an intense game.
Lack of suspension for Taylor Hall for punching Ilya Lyubushkin frustrating, but not surprisingLet’s make one thing clear.
Taylor Hall will forfeit 0.00111% of his salary this season.
Just say "Taylor Hall was not punished" and be on with it.

     Bruins Notebook: Picking up the pieces after rough night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the first time in a while, the Bruins gathered at Warrior Ice Arena on Wednesday to dust themselves off after a legitimately bad loss.
On a second viewing, coach Bruce Cassidy saw a little more brightness that wasn’t evident in the midst of the defeat.
We’ll wait to get here in the morning and see if there’s any surprises,” said Cassidy.
Forbort was not as noticeable as some other D-men – considering his stay-at-home game, that’s not a knock – but Clifton had a particularly rough first period, when he was directly responsible for two goals against.
“This is about getting guys work.

Quite frankly, the Toronto Maple Leafs kept the Bruins from establishing any ground during Tuesday’s pivotal Atlantic Division matchup at TD Garden.
49 for Auston Matthews 👀pic.twitter.com/A2XdB5XvXr — Hockey Night in Canada (@hockeynight) March 30, 2022The Bruins ran into frustrating officiating throughout Tuesday’s tilt.
“You’re going to have to take more chances, maybe not right away, but somewhere in the second period to get back into the game.
As a result, the Bruins find themselves in familiar territory, chasing both the Leafs and the Tampa Bay Lightning in the standings.
