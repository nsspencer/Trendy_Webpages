     Sixers: Is Joel Embiid losing momentum for MVP?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last time ESPN did its MVP straw poll, Joel Embiid held a narrow lead for No.
Bontemps polled 100 media members to gauge the current state of the MVP race.
Nikola Jokic received 62 first-place votes and tallied 860 points, while Embiid garnered only 29 first-place votes and tallied 719 points.

For the season, Embiid is averaging 29.9 points, 11.4 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.4 blocks on .489/.364/.816 shooting splits.

     Harden's Impressive Performance Not Enough for Sixers to Beat Bucks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two nights later, the Sixers returned to South Philly and faced their Eastern Conference rival, the Milwaukee Bucks, for the third time this year.
On Tuesday, when the Sixers welcomed the Bucks back to town, they attempted to get back in the winner’s column against the defending champions.
Like always, Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks issued the Sixers a problematic matchup.
In a rather rough quarter for the Sixers, Harden kept them alive as he scored 13 of their 28 third-quarter points.
Embiid scored eight points in nine minutes as the Bucks and the Sixers remained neck and neck throughout the third quarter.

     Sixers know more adjustments are needed after tight losses to Bucks, Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Playoff series are often decided by adjustments, then adjustments to those adjustments, and so on.
That’s not an indication that losing double-digit leads to the Suns and Bucks portends a pre-playoffs skid.
“We showed him some film of the Phoenix game and I think the Lakers game,” Rivers said.
He said, ‘I haven’t had a spot-up swing in … ever.’ So now he’s getting them and that’s good, because he’s a great shooter.
The Sixers aren’t a million miles from beating elite teams in seven-game series, but they’re aiming for many-faceted improvement.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the end of the third and start of the fourth quarter, the tides slowly began to change.
