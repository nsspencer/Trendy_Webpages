    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For four years, the U.S. men carried the sting and the shame of missing the World Cup in Russia.
Despite an uninspiring performance and a 2-0 loss to Costa Rica, the U.S. men officially qualified for the World Cup on Wednesday night.
But qualifying for the World Cup is never an easy, or sure, thing.
The World Cup begins Nov. 21 and will be played over four weeks at eight stadiums across Qatar.
"Obviously after the last World Cup, it was tough for some guys," Reyna said.

He's consistently mature in how he shields the ball, and in the second half he became more influential as the US pushed for a goal.
Musah was unlucky not to get on the scoresheet with a shot cleared off the line.

     USMNT qualifies for World Cup: Don't let the loss to Costa Rica fool you, the future is bright for USA soccer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: July 1, 2014 was the last time anybody saw the United States men's national team at a FIFA World Cup.
It was a 2-1 defeat to Belgium in extra time in the round of 16 -- you know the one.
Wednesday night in San Jose, Costa Rica saw this young USMNT book their ticket to Qatar, though it came following a poor 2-0 loss where the team was inconsistent and struggled with the physicality of their opponent.
Don't let this match fool you -- this team has been more good than bad, and they've been much better than what we saw during the 2018 cycle.
Never has the USMNT had this much talent, and never has a team this young worn these colors and pulled off what they did.

     Summary: That’s not to say it can’t happen at the World Cup, but the odds are not in the U.S.’s favor.
So what might a U.S. World Cup squad look like?
Ahead of the 2010 World Cup, Hérculez Gómez and Edson Buddle made themselves undroppable with their scoring form.
Nevertheless, the U.S.’s roster picture over the next eight months is going to be a target of scrutiny and speculation.
As of last Sept. 1, you would have put Brooks’s name in a World Cup starting XI in ink.
