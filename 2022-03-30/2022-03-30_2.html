    </h2>

     Summary: For four years, the U.S. men carried the sting and the shame of missing the World Cup in Russia.
Despite an uninspiring performance and a 2-0 loss to Costa Rica, the U.S. men officially qualified for the World Cup on Wednesday night.
But qualifying for the World Cup is never an easy, or sure, thing.
The World Cup begins Nov. 21 and will be played over four weeks at eight stadiums across Qatar.
"Obviously after the last World Cup, it was tough for some guys," Reyna said.

     USMNT qualifies for World Cup: Don't let the loss to Costa Rica fool you, the future is bright for USA soccer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: July 1, 2014 was the last time anybody saw the United States men's national team at a FIFA World Cup.
It was a 2-1 defeat to Belgium in extra time in the round of 16 -- you know the one.
Wednesday night in San Jose, Costa Rica saw this young USMNT book their ticket to Qatar, though it came following a poor 2-0 loss where the team was inconsistent and struggled with the physicality of their opponent.
Don't let this match fool you -- this team has been more good than bad, and they've been much better than what we saw during the 2018 cycle.
Never has the USMNT had this much talent, and never has a team this young worn these colors and pulled off what they did.

     Summary: “Really excited to celebrate with this group, really proud of everyone who was involved in this whole process.
And the perspective is we're the youngest US team to ever qualify for the World Cup, and we'll be the youngest team at the World Cup.
On the other, the United States men are back in the World Cup, for the seventh time in the last eight editions.
That improbable collapse would’ve prompted a June playoff match vs. New Zealand (Oceania’s representative), a game Costa Rica now heads to with hopes of booking their own Qatar ticket.
“I mean, It was one of the toughest days of my life when we didn’t qualify for the World Cup.

     Summary: That’s not to say it can’t happen at the World Cup, but the odds are not in the U.S.’s favor.
So what might a U.S. World Cup squad look like?
Ahead of the 2010 World Cup, Hérculez Gómez and Edson Buddle made themselves undroppable with their scoring form.
Nevertheless, the U.S.’s roster picture over the next eight months is going to be a target of scrutiny and speculation.
As of last Sept. 1, you would have put Brooks’s name in a World Cup starting XI in ink.
