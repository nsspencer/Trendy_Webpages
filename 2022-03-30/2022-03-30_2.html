     Summary: The young Valencia midfielder really grew into the match.
He's consistently mature in how he shields the ball, and in the second half he became more influential as the US pushed for a goal.
Musah was unlucky not to get on the scoresheet with a shot cleared off the line.

     USA qualifies for 2022 World Cup, seals return after missing 2018
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This time, there was no unthinkable capitulation for the U.S. men’s national team with a World Cup berth hanging in the balance.
The U.S. is heading back to the World Cup, clinching despite a 2-0 defeat in Costa Rica on Wednesday night and securing a return for the Americans after they missed out in 2018.
There were some eerie similarities for the U.S. in the final stages of this qualifying campaign.
The U.S. wound up securing a third-place finish in the Concacaf Octagonal, and it joins fellow 2026 World Cup co-hosts Canada and Mexico in occupying the region’s three automatic berths in Qatar.
The U.S. will be in Pot 2 for the draw on Friday, when it will learn its opponents for the November-December World Cup in Qatar.

     USMNT qualifies for World Cup: Don't let the loss to Costa Rica fool you, the future is bright for USA soccer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: July 1, 2014 was the last time anybody saw the United States men's national team at a FIFA World Cup.
It was a 2-1 defeat to Belgium in extra time in the round of 16 -- you know the one.
Wednesday night in San Jose, Costa Rica saw this young USMNT book their ticket to Qatar, though it came following a poor 2-0 loss where the team was inconsistent and struggled with the physicality of their opponent.
Don't let this match fool you -- this team has been more good than bad, and they've been much better than what we saw during the 2018 cycle.
Never has the USMNT had this much talent, and never has a team this young worn these colors and pulled off what they did.
