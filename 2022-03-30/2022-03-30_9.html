     Tyga and Rob Kardashian Respond to Blac Chyna’s Child Support Claim and Having to Sell 3 Cars

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Blac Chyna posted a series of tweets on Wednesday in which she suggested that she receives no child support to help raise her son with Tyga, King Cairo Stevenson, or her daughter with Rob Kardashian, Dream Renée Kardashian.
After catching wind of her comments, both men took to social media to respond.
The Shade Room posted Chyna’s tweets, to which Tyga responded that he pays $40K for his son’s school and that he lives with him Monday through Saturday, so he sees no need to pay Chyna any child support.
“Yesterday I had to give up 3 of my cars …my reasons… morals, beliefs, being a single mother, no support I’m a MAMA,” she tweeted.
Chyna later responded on Twitter to Tyga and a claim that she was leasing her cars with a “lol.”
