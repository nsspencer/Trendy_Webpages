     U.S. to send Ukraine additional $500M, Biden tells Zelenskyy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The United States has rolled out several rounds of aid to Ukraine in recent weeks, as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assault on the country has dragged on for more than a month and Ukrainian forces have remained largely successful in repelling the Russian invaders.
Following Zelenskyy’s impassioned address to Congress earlier this month, the administration announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total amount of U.S. contributions to Ukraine since the start of the Biden administration to roughly $2 billion.
And when Biden traveled to Europe last week — his first visit there since the invasion began — he announced an additional $1 billion in humanitarian assistance and pledged that the United States would accept up to 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine.
The Biden administration’s budget plan, released on Monday, also calls for an additional $682 million for Ukraine, “to counter Russian malign influence and to meet emerging needs related to security, energy, cybersecurity issues, disinformation, macroeconomic stabilization, and civil society resilience.”In their call on Wednesday, Biden and Zelenskyy discussed “how the United States is working around the clock to fulfill the main security assistance requests by Ukraine, the critical effects those weapons have had on the conflict, and continued efforts by the United States with allies and partners to identify additional capabilities to help the Ukrainian military defend its country,” according to the White House readout.
Zelenskyy, in his own summary of the roughly hourlong conversation, tweeted that he shared with Biden his “assessment of the situation on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.” The leaders also discussed “specific defensive support, a new package of enhanced sanctions, [and] macro-financial and humanitarian aid,” according to Zelenskyy.

     Thomas: The words of JFK, Ronald Reagan and Joe Biden
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Biden echoed Kennedy’s optimism when he quoted a phrase Pope John Paul II often used: “Do not be afraid.”In 1987, Ronald Reagan visited Berlin and delivered his “Mr.
Gorbachev, tear down this wall” speech.
Like Biden, Reagan contrasted systems of government that preserve freedom with those ruled by autocrats who quash freedom.
Did he mean the Putin war against Ukraine, or something bigger, like the decades-long Cold War?
Those presidents used powerful words and Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative to wear down the Soviet Union and cause its collapse.

     Summary: WASHINGTON – Donald Trump wants a favor from Vladimir Putin.
"I would think Putin would know the answer to that," Trump said an interview on the "Just The News" television program.
Joe Biden has not been implicated in his son's business dealings, and the White House denounced Trump's request of Russia.
Trump and Putin: Putin purposely coughed.
Political opponents derided Trump for seeking dirt on Biden from Putin, especially after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has included sustained attacks on civilians.

     Republicans Offer Black Americans a Brighter, Prosperous Future. Joe Biden is Proof | Opinion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inflation is an invisible tax on poor people, and the percentage of Black Americans in poverty is practically double their percentage of the total population.
According to the U.S. Census, in 2019 Black Americans represented 23.8 percent of the population living in poverty, while accounting for only 13.2 percent of the population overall.
The Black community is finally waking up to the Democrats' war on our wallets.
Wriley found that between 2017 and 2019, median household incomes grew by 15.4 percent among Black Americans and only 11.5 percent among whites.
If the Black community at large continues to vote for politicians who willfully mishandle the economy, it will be voting for its own destruction.

Hunter Biden is definitely a major sleazeball, and it’s possible his efforts to cash in on his family name included this deal.
Trump is going farther, alleging not only that Hunter Biden did get this money, but that his father did, too.
During his first campaign for president, Trump was secretly negotiating a deal to build towers in Moscow.
He also testified that, because he was lying about his lack of contacts with Russia, Trump was subject to blackmail by Putin, had Putin any reason to break with Trump.

Biden simply confirmed that suspicion with his latest regime change remarks.
He observed that the goal was “not whether but how to destabilise” states like Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and even Saudi Arabia.
Instead, Washington has used Russia’s invasion to present Putin even more clearly as uniquely evil, a new Hitler, who cannot be negotiated with.
Economic warAs happened earlier in Syria, Washington is gradually turning Ukraine into a proxy war.
