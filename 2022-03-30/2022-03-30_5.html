     Severe weather possible in Charlotte Thursday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is a chance for severe storms in the Carolinas on Thursday, but a few factors could play into how strong the storms are.
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A storm system moving across the South will bring widespread rain and storms to the Carolinas Thursday with a chance for more severe weather in the Charlotte area.
This system is massive and is having an impact from Minnesota and Wisconsin with heavy snow to severe weather in the Southeast along the Gulf Coast.
Luckily for the Carolinas, the storm system will be at its strongest Wednesday and will weaken as it gets closer to us.
Severe weather threat ThursdayThe reason why there are two separate orange areas (medium threat for severe storms) to the north and south of Charlotte is the ingredients are better there than in the greater Charlotte area.
