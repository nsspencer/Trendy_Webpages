     ‘Game of Thrones’ Prequel Series ‘House of the Dragon’ to Debut in August
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “House of the Dragon,” HBO’s first spin-off series of its record-breaking juggernaut “Game of Thrones,” will premiere on Aug. 21, the network announced Wednesday.
HBO also revealed a new poster for the series and additional images from the show, which you can view below.
Set two centuries before the events of “Game of Thrones,” the ten-episode prequel series will depict how the House of Targaryen fell into a bitter and brutal civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons — presaging the beginning of the end of the ruling family of Westeros.
In February, Martin announced on his personal blog that shooting on Season 1 of “House of the Dragon” had wrapped.
“I have seen rough cuts of a few of them, and I’m loving them,” Martin wrote.

     Game of Thrones Prequel ‘House of the Dragon’ Cast &amp; Details
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Ollie Upton/HBOHBO has announced an August 21 release for House of the Dragon, a Game of Thrones “successor show” that follows a Targaryen civil war that took place in Westeros 300 years before the events of the original series.
Although it may be difficult to live up to the expectations set by its epic record-breaking predecessor, the first episode of House of the Dragon is already George R.R.
While Game of Thrones was based in Northern Ireland for its entire run, it appears that House of the Dragon has opted to shoot in England instead.
Straight from the (probable) set of House of the Dragon, are we looking at the seat of House Velaryon?
HBO announced that House of the Dragon will be streaming on its site this August 21.
