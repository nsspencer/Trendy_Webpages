     Summary: The Eastern Conference playoff race continues to be a jumbled-up mess as there continues to be movement in the standings every day which makes every game that much more important.
The Philadelphia 76ers fell to the Milwaukee Bucks which caused some more movement in the East.
Until the conclusion of the regular season on April 10, we are going to regularly update the Eastern Conference standings and where the Sixers are at on an everyday basis while also taking a look at who they could possibly face in the Eastern Conference.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHILADELPHIA–As the Philadelphia 76ers look to move on from their loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday at home, they have seven games left in the regular season to figure it all out.
The Sixers are not on that level yet and that is going to be a potential issue in the playoffs.
With seven games left, they have to do a lot in order to get the job done when it matters most.
“Get on the same page and as I said, everybody wants to,” Rivers added.
“When you start with that, you got a great chance of getting it done.”This post originally appeared on Sixers Wire!

     Sixers: Is Joel Embiid losing momentum for MVP?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last time ESPN did its MVP straw poll, Joel Embiid held a narrow lead for No.
Bontemps polled 100 media members to gauge the current state of the MVP race.
Nikola Jokic received 62 first-place votes and tallied 860 points, while Embiid garnered only 29 first-place votes and tallied 719 points.
Many voters stressed how tough it was for them to choose which way to go, both among the positioning of top-three finishers and fourth and fifth places.”Is Sixers’ Joel Embiid losing momentum in the 2022 MVP race?
For the season, Embiid is averaging 29.9 points, 11.4 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.4 blocks on .489/.364/.816 shooting splits.

     Joel Embiid rips 76ers' game plan after late collapse vs. Bucks: Next time 'match up' my minutes with Giannis'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Joel Embiid checked out of the game in the third quarter Tuesday night between the Philadelphia 76ers and Milwaukee Bucks, his team led 82-72 with 3:37 remaining in the period.
Embiid subbed back into the game shortly after Giannis' ridiculous offensive outburst, but by that time Milwaukee already gained momentum leading this game to come down to the final possession.
After the game, when asked what he thinks went wrong for the Sixers, Embiid pointed to Giannis' 15-point run and the fact that Philadelphia had no answer to slow him down.
When asked what the Sixers could've done differently to slow down Giannis, Embiid said it didn't help he was on the bench during Antetokounmpo's entire run.
Matching Embiid's minutes with Antetokounmpo's is Philadelphia's best answer at trying to slow the reigning Finals MVP, because Doc Rivers' plan to throw Paul Millsap at Giannis surely didn't work.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Sixers have seven games left before the bright lights of the 2022 NBA Playoffs turn on.
There are still multiple variations of how the standings could play out over these next two weeks.
Before the two Eastern Conference heavyweights squared off, Doc Rivers was asked his thoughts on the close seeding race to close out the year.
No matter how things play out in these final games, the road to the NBA Finals through the East will be hard-fought no matter what.
Because of this, the Sixers are much better off using this time to best prepare themselves instead of worrying about the standings.

     Summary: During the end of the third and start of the fourth quarter, the tides slowly began to change.
Most mentioned poor execution as a catalyst in their downfall and cited it as a key area of improvement in this final stretch of the regular season.
“Just a few execution things on both ends of the floor, offensively, defensively.
Mainly in that fourth quarter, we had a couple of lapses that led to open looks for them, and good looks that they converted on.
In the final quarter, Milwaukee outscored the Sixers 37-27 and shot 72.2% from the floor.

     Summary: Playoff series are often decided by adjustments, then adjustments to those adjustments, and so on.
That’s not an indication that losing double-digit leads to the Suns and Bucks portends a pre-playoffs skid.
“We showed him some film of the Phoenix game and I think the Lakers game,” Rivers said.
He said, ‘I haven’t had a spot-up swing in … ever.’ So now he’s getting them and that’s good, because he’s a great shooter.
The Sixers aren’t a million miles from beating elite teams in seven-game series, but they’re aiming for many-faceted improvement.

     Harden's Impressive Performance Not Enough for Sixers to Beat Bucks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two nights later, the Sixers returned to South Philly and faced their Eastern Conference rival, the Milwaukee Bucks, for the third time this year.
On Tuesday, when the Sixers welcomed the Bucks back to town, they attempted to get back in the winner’s column against the defending champions.
Like always, Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks issued the Sixers a problematic matchup.
In a rather rough quarter for the Sixers, Harden kept them alive as he scored 13 of their 28 third-quarter points.
Embiid scored eight points in nine minutes as the Bucks and the Sixers remained neck and neck throughout the third quarter.
