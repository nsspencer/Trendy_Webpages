     Joe Biden receives 2nd booster while pressing Congress on virus funds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Biden pressed lawmakers to provide additional funding “immediately” to ensure continued supply of the tools that have helped the nation begin to emerge from the pandemic.
“Congress, we need to secure additional supply now,” he said, warning of shortages of vaccines, tests and treatments.
“This isn’t partisan, it’s medicine.”Biden, 79, received the first series of two doses of the coronavirus vaccine shortly before taking office and a first booster shot in September.
The additional booster dose was administered by a member of the White House Medical Unit.
But it doesn’t seem to cause more severe disease than the original, and vaccines appear just as effective against it.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden received his second booster shot before television cameras on Wednesday following remarks at the White House about the state of the country's COVID response.
Administration officials for weeks have been ringing alarm bells about the critical need for more COVID funding, warning of the severe consequences for Americans.
Biden on Wednesday sent what a White House official called an "urgent, direct message to Congress" to act swiftly to secure funding for the administration's COVID response.
The White House has asked for $22.5 billion in immediate aid to keep COVID-19 programs afloat.
Since then, the White House has urged Democrats and Republicans on the Hill to come to an agreement, but negotiations remain at a stalemate.

     Republicans Offer Black Americans a Brighter, Prosperous Future. Joe Biden is Proof | Opinion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inflation is an invisible tax on poor people, and the percentage of Black Americans in poverty is practically double their percentage of the total population.
According to the U.S. Census, in 2019 Black Americans represented 23.8 percent of the population living in poverty, while accounting for only 13.2 percent of the population overall.
The Black community is finally waking up to the Democrats' war on our wallets.
Wriley found that between 2017 and 2019, median household incomes grew by 15.4 percent among Black Americans and only 11.5 percent among whites.
If the Black community at large continues to vote for politicians who willfully mishandle the economy, it will be voting for its own destruction.

     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden received a second booster dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, a day after federal regulators approved a fourth shot for those aged 50 and older.
People will also be able to find the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on COVID-19 in their community.
The additional booster dose will be administered by a member of the White House Medical Unit.
A subvariant of the highly transmissible omicron that scientists call BA.2 is now the dominant coronavirus mutant in the United States.
But it doesn’t seem to cause more severe disease than the original, and vaccines appear just as effective against it.

Mr. Parker, two years older than Mr. Till, was with his cousin at their relatives’ home in Mississippi and witnessed Mr. Till’s kidnapping.
Mr. Bryant and Mr. Milam later told a reporter that they kidnapped and killed Mr. Till.

     Summary: Biden echoed Kennedy’s optimism when he quoted a phrase Pope John Paul II often used: “Do not be afraid.”In 1987, Ronald Reagan visited Berlin and delivered his “Mr.
Gorbachev, tear down this wall” speech.
Like Biden, Reagan contrasted systems of government that preserve freedom with those ruled by autocrats who quash freedom.
Did he mean the Putin war against Ukraine, or something bigger, like the decades-long Cold War?
Those presidents used powerful words and Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative to wear down the Soviet Union and cause its collapse.

Biden simply confirmed that suspicion with his latest regime change remarks.
He observed that the goal was “not whether but how to destabilise” states like Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and even Saudi Arabia.
Instead, Washington has used Russia’s invasion to present Putin even more clearly as uniquely evil, a new Hitler, who cannot be negotiated with.
Economic warAs happened earlier in Syria, Washington is gradually turning Ukraine into a proxy war.
