     Joe Biden receives 2nd booster while pressing Congress on virus funds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Biden pressed lawmakers to provide additional funding “immediately” to ensure continued supply of the tools that have helped the nation begin to emerge from the pandemic.
“Congress, we need to secure additional supply now,” he said, warning of shortages of vaccines, tests and treatments.
“This isn’t partisan, it’s medicine.”Biden, 79, received the first series of two doses of the coronavirus vaccine shortly before taking office and a first booster shot in September.
The additional booster dose was administered by a member of the White House Medical Unit.
But it doesn’t seem to cause more severe disease than the original, and vaccines appear just as effective against it.

     Summary: President Joe Biden plans Thursday to invoke Cold War powers to encourage domestic production of critical minerals for electric-vehicle and other types of batteries, according to people familiar with the matter.
The White House is poised to add battery materials to the list of items covered by the 1950 Defense Production Act -- the same authority wielded by Harry Truman to make steel for the Korean War and Donald Trump to spur mask production to tackle the coronavirus pandemic -- the people said.
They asked not to be identified because the details are not yet public.

Then Biden swiftly turned his remarks towards asking Congress for more money to continue the effort to halt the coronavirus pandemic.
“Just as we’ve reached a critical turning point in this fight, Congress has to provide the funding America needs to continue to fight Covid-19,” he said.
“It didn’t hurt a bit,” Biden said of the shot, apologizing if the sight of a needle going into his arm had “discouraged” anybody from taking the vaccine.

     Biden eyes Cold War-era defense law to boost mining sector
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Such an order under the Defense Production Act is expected to help companies access government funding for feasibility studies for new projects that extract lithium, nickel and other EV metals, or to make existing facilities more productive.
Securing enough raw materials to make electric vehicle batteries has been a major obstacle, with domestic mines facing extensive regulatory hurdles and environmental opposition.
Biden blocked a proposed Minnesota copper mine earlier this year, and his administration is heightening scrutiny on other proposed mines.
Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, invoked the DPA in 2019 to build up a stockpile of rare earths, the specialized minerals used to make magnets found in weaponry and EVs.
Several industry executives said the decision shows Biden is taking the looming supply shortage seriously and they were eager for details on how Biden would use DPA to boost domestic EV metals production.

     Summary: President Joe Biden rolls up his sleeve before receiving his second COVID-19 booster shot in the South Court Auditorium on the White House campus, Wednesday, March 30, 2022, in Washington.
The White House says the initiative has so far expanded to more than 2,000 locations across the nation.
There have been discussions within the White House about the possibility of Biden discussing the state of the pandemic for a number of weeks, according to a source familiar.
Last week, White House response coordinator Jeff Zients warned that second Covid-19 booster shots would not be free and readily available to the public without additional funding.
But funding from Congress is key to moving into that new stage, White House officials stress.

“But do we have anyone left who knows operations?”Jha himself appears to be aware of the concerns.
Public health precautions like mask wearing and social distancing have disappeared across much of the country.
The rollout upset top health officials, who wondered why they weren’t consulted on Jha’s appointment, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Some Covid team staffers, convinced that Jha’s appointment precedes a hollowing out of the White House-level pandemic response unit, are looking for new jobs.

Hunter Biden is definitely a major sleazeball, and it’s possible his efforts to cash in on his family name included this deal.

He also testified that, because he was lying about his lack of contacts with Russia, Trump was subject to blackmail by Putin, had Putin any reason to break with Trump.
