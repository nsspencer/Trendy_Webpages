     Biden Poised to Use Cold-War Powers to Boost Battery Metals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden plans Thursday to invoke Cold War powers to encourage domestic production of critical minerals for electric-vehicle and other types of batteries, according to people familiar with the matter.
The White House is poised to add battery materials to the list of items covered by the 1950 Defense Production Act -- the same authority wielded by Harry Truman to make steel for the Korean War and Donald Trump to spur mask production to tackle the coronavirus pandemic -- the people said.
They asked not to be identified because the details are not yet public.

Then Biden swiftly turned his remarks towards asking Congress for more money to continue the effort to halt the coronavirus pandemic.
“Just as we’ve reached a critical turning point in this fight, Congress has to provide the funding America needs to continue to fight Covid-19,” he said.
“It didn’t hurt a bit,” Biden said of the shot, apologizing if the sight of a needle going into his arm had “discouraged” anybody from taking the vaccine.

     Republicans Offer Black Americans a Brighter, Prosperous Future. Joe Biden is Proof | Opinion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inflation is an invisible tax on poor people, and the percentage of Black Americans in poverty is practically double their percentage of the total population.
According to the U.S. Census, in 2019 Black Americans represented 23.8 percent of the population living in poverty, while accounting for only 13.2 percent of the population overall.
The Black community is finally waking up to the Democrats' war on our wallets.
Wriley found that between 2017 and 2019, median household incomes grew by 15.4 percent among Black Americans and only 11.5 percent among whites.
If the Black community at large continues to vote for politicians who willfully mishandle the economy, it will be voting for its own destruction.

     U.S. to send Ukraine additional $500M, Biden tells Zelenskyy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The United States has rolled out several rounds of aid to Ukraine in recent weeks, as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assault on the country has dragged on for more than a month and Ukrainian forces have remained largely successful in repelling the Russian invaders.
Following Zelenskyy’s impassioned address to Congress earlier this month, the administration announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total amount of U.S. contributions to Ukraine since the start of the Biden administration to roughly $2 billion.
And when Biden traveled to Europe last week — his first visit there since the invasion began — he announced an additional $1 billion in humanitarian assistance and pledged that the United States would accept up to 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine.
The Biden administration’s budget plan, released on Monday, also calls for an additional $682 million for Ukraine, “to counter Russian malign influence and to meet emerging needs related to security, energy, cybersecurity issues, disinformation, macroeconomic stabilization, and civil society resilience.”In their call on Wednesday, Biden and Zelenskyy discussed “how the United States is working around the clock to fulfill the main security assistance requests by Ukraine, the critical effects those weapons have had on the conflict, and continued efforts by the United States with allies and partners to identify additional capabilities to help the Ukrainian military defend its country,” according to the White House readout.
Zelenskyy, in his own summary of the roughly hourlong conversation, tweeted that he shared with Biden his “assessment of the situation on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.” The leaders also discussed “specific defensive support, a new package of enhanced sanctions, [and] macro-financial and humanitarian aid,” according to Zelenskyy.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Biden pressed lawmakers to provide additional funding “immediately” to ensure continued supply of the tools that have helped the nation begin to emerge from the pandemic.
“Congress, we need to secure additional supply now,” he said, warning of shortages of vaccines, tests and treatments.
“This isn’t partisan, it’s medicine.”Biden, 79, received the first series of two doses of the coronavirus vaccine shortly before taking office and a first booster shot in September.
The additional booster dose was administered by a member of the White House Medical Unit.
But it doesn’t seem to cause more severe disease than the original, and vaccines appear just as effective against it.

“But do we have anyone left who knows operations?”Jha himself appears to be aware of the concerns.
Public health precautions like mask wearing and social distancing have disappeared across much of the country.
The rollout upset top health officials, who wondered why they weren’t consulted on Jha’s appointment, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Some Covid team staffers, convinced that Jha’s appointment precedes a hollowing out of the White House-level pandemic response unit, are looking for new jobs.

In this case, it could also complicate Putin’s calculations, a second US official said.
One senior European diplomat said the US assessment was in line with European thinking.

Instead, Washington has used Russia’s invasion to present Putin even more clearly as uniquely evil, a new Hitler, who cannot be negotiated with.
