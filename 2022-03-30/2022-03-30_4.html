     Joel Embiid, Sixers pleading with James Harden to be more aggressive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harden has been so used to being a point guard over the past couple of years that he isn’t used to being so wide-open off swing passes.
In the Phoenix game, and the Laker game, the ball swings, he’s never had that.
He’s never had that where he’s getting the ball swung to him and he rarely shoots them.
He was laughing saying ‘I haven’t had a spot-up swing ever’.
A guy like Jo gets double teams in the post and the ball gets swung to me.

     Summary: During the end of the third and start of the fourth quarter, the tides slowly began to change.
Most mentioned poor execution as a catalyst in their downfall and cited it as a key area of improvement in this final stretch of the regular season.
“Just a few execution things on both ends of the floor, offensively, defensively.
Mainly in that fourth quarter, we had a couple of lapses that led to open looks for them, and good looks that they converted on.
In the final quarter, Milwaukee outscored the Sixers 37-27 and shot 72.2% from the floor.

     Summary: PHILADELPHIA — From the Sixers’ perspective, Tuesday’s 118-116 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks is perhaps in the eye of the beholder.
And after the game, Joel Embiid chose to focus on the five.“The game really changed when I went on the bench,” Embiid said.
Here’s the situation he’s referencing: Embiid went to the bench with 2:22 left in the third quarter and the Sixers leading 82-72.
James Harden would leave at the beginning of the fourth quarter with the Sixers still up 89-81.
Milwaukee went on a 12-2 run to start the fourth quarter, with Antetokounmpo scoring 15 straight points for the Bucks after Embiid left the game.

     Summary: Two nights later, the Sixers returned to South Philly and faced their Eastern Conference rival, the Milwaukee Bucks, for the third time this year.
On Tuesday, when the Sixers welcomed the Bucks back to town, they attempted to get back in the winner’s column against the defending champions.
Like always, Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks issued the Sixers a problematic matchup.
In a rather rough quarter for the Sixers, Harden kept them alive as he scored 13 of their 28 third-quarter points.
Embiid scored eight points in nine minutes as the Bucks and the Sixers remained neck and neck throughout the third quarter.

     Summary: Playoff series are often decided by adjustments, then adjustments to those adjustments, and so on.
That’s not an indication that losing double-digit leads to the Suns and Bucks portends a pre-playoffs skid.
“We showed him some film of the Phoenix game and I think the Lakers game,” Rivers said.
He said, ‘I haven’t had a spot-up swing in … ever.’ So now he’s getting them and that’s good, because he’s a great shooter.
The Sixers aren’t a million miles from beating elite teams in seven-game series, but they’re aiming for many-faceted improvement.
