     U.S. to send Ukraine additional $500M, Biden tells Zelenskyy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The United States has rolled out several rounds of aid to Ukraine in recent weeks, as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assault on the country has dragged on for more than a month and Ukrainian forces have remained largely successful in repelling the Russian invaders.
Following Zelenskyy’s impassioned address to Congress earlier this month, the administration announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total amount of U.S. contributions to Ukraine since the start of the Biden administration to roughly $2 billion.
And when Biden traveled to Europe last week — his first visit there since the invasion began — he announced an additional $1 billion in humanitarian assistance and pledged that the United States would accept up to 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine.
The Biden administration’s budget plan, released on Monday, also calls for an additional $682 million for Ukraine, “to counter Russian malign influence and to meet emerging needs related to security, energy, cybersecurity issues, disinformation, macroeconomic stabilization, and civil society resilience.”In their call on Wednesday, Biden and Zelenskyy discussed “how the United States is working around the clock to fulfill the main security assistance requests by Ukraine, the critical effects those weapons have had on the conflict, and continued efforts by the United States with allies and partners to identify additional capabilities to help the Ukrainian military defend its country,” according to the White House readout.
Zelenskyy, in his own summary of the roughly hourlong conversation, tweeted that he shared with Biden his “assessment of the situation on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.” The leaders also discussed “specific defensive support, a new package of enhanced sanctions, [and] macro-financial and humanitarian aid,” according to Zelenskyy.

Then Biden swiftly turned his remarks towards asking Congress for more money to continue the effort to halt the coronavirus pandemic.
“Just as we’ve reached a critical turning point in this fight, Congress has to provide the funding America needs to continue to fight Covid-19,” he said.
“It didn’t hurt a bit,” Biden said of the shot, apologizing if the sight of a needle going into his arm had “discouraged” anybody from taking the vaccine.

     Summary: Biden pressed lawmakers to provide additional funding “immediately” to ensure continued supply of the tools that have helped the nation begin to emerge from the pandemic.
“Congress, we need to secure additional supply now,” he said, warning of shortages of vaccines, tests and treatments.
“This isn’t partisan, it’s medicine.”Biden, 79, received the first series of two doses of the coronavirus vaccine shortly before taking office and a first booster shot in September.
The additional booster dose was administered by a member of the White House Medical Unit.
But it doesn’t seem to cause more severe disease than the original, and vaccines appear just as effective against it.

“I’ve always thought that it discourages people getting a vaccination when they watch people get a needle in their arm.

“If you haven’t gotten your first booster, please don’t wait, do it today.”AdvertisementPresident Joe Biden rolls up his sleeve before receiving his second COVID-19 booster shot on the White House campus on Wednesday.
Biden nevertheless encouraged Americans to remain vigilant and get vaccinated, and he urged Congress to renew funding for COVID prevention and treatment programs.

The White House says the initiative has so far expanded to more than 2,000 locations across the nation.
There have been discussions within the White House about the possibility of Biden discussing the state of the pandemic for a number of weeks, according to a source familiar.
Last week, White House response coordinator Jeff Zients warned that second Covid-19 booster shots would not be free and readily available to the public without additional funding.
But funding from Congress is key to moving into that new stage, White House officials stress.

The rollout upset top health officials, who wondered why they weren’t consulted on Jha’s appointment, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Some Covid team staffers, convinced that Jha’s appointment precedes a hollowing out of the White House-level pandemic response unit, are looking for new jobs.

Instead, Washington has used Russia’s invasion to present Putin even more clearly as uniquely evil, a new Hitler, who cannot be negotiated with.
