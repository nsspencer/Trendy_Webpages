     Severe weather possible in Charlotte Thursday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is a chance for severe storms in the Carolinas on Thursday, but a few factors could play into how strong the storms are.
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A storm system moving across the South will bring widespread rain and storms to the Carolinas Thursday with a chance for more severe weather in the Charlotte area.
Luckily for the Carolinas, the storm system will be at its strongest Wednesday and will weaken as it gets closer to us.
But there is still a low-to-medium threat of severe thunderstorms.
Severe weather threat ThursdayThe reason why there are two separate orange areas (medium threat for severe storms) to the north and south of Charlotte is the ingredients are better there than in the greater Charlotte area.
