    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A storm system passed through the Memphis area on Wednesday afternoon, carrying heavy rain and prompting tornado warnings, but the county appeared to have avoided the worst of it.
By 6 p.m., the storm system had largely moved on to the east.
There were no indications of a tornado touchdown in Shelby County, said Brent Perkins with the county's Emergency Management and Homeland Security agency.
In Germantown, one of the suburbs in the path of the weather system, all appeared clear, said Jessica Comas, a spokesperson for the city.
As the storm system moved east, stronger winds rocked some East Memphis and East Shelby County neighborhoods and towns.

     Severe weather possible in Charlotte Thursday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is a chance for severe storms in the Carolinas on Thursday, but a few factors could play into how strong the storms are.
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A storm system moving across the South will bring widespread rain and storms to the Carolinas Thursday with a chance for more severe weather in the Charlotte area.
This system is massive and is having an impact from Minnesota and Wisconsin with heavy snow to severe weather in the Southeast along the Gulf Coast.
Luckily for the Carolinas, the storm system will be at its strongest Wednesday and will weaken as it gets closer to us.
Severe weather threat ThursdayThe reason why there are two separate orange areas (medium threat for severe storms) to the north and south of Charlotte is the ingredients are better there than in the greater Charlotte area.
