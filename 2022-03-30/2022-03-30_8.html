     Trump calls on Putin to release damaging information on Hunter Biden
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington — Former President Donald Trump pushed Russian President Vladimir Putin to release information about Hunter Biden, President Biden's son and his alleged business dealings with oligarchs in Eastern Europe in a new interview published Tuesday.
She gave them $3.5 million," Trump said in the interview from his South Florida property, Mar-a-Lago.
"So, now I would think Putin would know the answer to that.
An attorney for Hunter Biden has repeatedly denied that his client co-founded the investment company, Rosemont Seneca Thornton, and therefore did not receive the $3.5 million.
Hunter Biden has since 2018 been under investigation for his tax affairs.

     Summary: Amid widespread criticism of his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump publicly called on Putin on Tuesday to release any dirt he might have on Hunter Biden, the president’s son.
“She gave him $3.5 million, so now I would think Putin would know the answer to that.
Trump's remarks in Tuesday's interview come shortly after GOP lawmakers urged President Biden to more forcefully punish Putin for waging war on Ukraine, only to have Trump praise Putin.
“I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, ‘This is genius.’ Putin declares a big portion of Ukraine — Putin declares it as independent.
“Just when you thought it couldn’t get worse, Joe Biden totally failed to deter Russia’s disgraceful invasion of Ukraine,” Trump said Saturday.

Honig said it appears the investigation into Hunter Biden's business overseas is "gaining steam."
Yet The Washington Post this week published a 3,000-word investigative report confirming key details of Hunter Biden's business dealings in China.
The Justice Department is reportedly continuing to look into potential illegal lobbying allegations against a consulting firm tied to Ukrainian energy company Burisma, on whose board Hunter Biden once sat.
"There is a realistic chance this could result in federal charges," Honig said.

     Did Trump Asking Putin for Dirt on Hunter Biden Violate Election Law?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Questions have been raised about whether Donald Trump asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to find information on Hunter Biden's alleged business dealings was a violation of federal law.
Elie Honig, CNN's senior legal analyst, said on Twitter he believed requesting campaign "dirt" should count as election assistance barred by federal law.
There have been other times where Trump has been accused of seeking foreign help in finding dirt on his political rivals.
One of those who took issue with the ruling was Ellen Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Commission.
"The bottom line is, Congress or the courts need to revise or clarify this loophole in federal election law if the statute is going to have any teeth," Rahmani said.

     Hunter Biden saga: Washington Post authenticates laptop after dismissing ‘fake' scandal in 2020

     Summary: The Washington Post published a lengthy report on Wednesday about Hunter Biden's "multimillion-dollar" financial ties to the Chinese energy company CEFC China Energy.
The Washington Post then addressed Hunter Biden's laptop, which was one of several sources on which the report was based.
In the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, The Washington Post largely kept its readers in the dark as to the seriousness of the Hunter Biden scandal.
Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler also authored a skeptical "explainer" of Hunter Biden's laptop.
The next day, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius penned a piece titled, "The truth behind the Hunter Biden non-scandal."

     Summary: The experts found the data had been repeatedly accessed and copied by people other than Hunter Biden over nearly three years.
The MacBook itself is now in the hands of the FBI, which is investigating whether Hunter Biden properly reported income from business dealings.
The drive also includes some verified emails from Hunter Biden’s work with Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company for which he was a board member.

Hackers sometimes create fake email accounts or gain access to authentic ones as part of disinformation campaigns — a possibility that cannot be ruled out with regard to the email files on Hunter Biden’s laptop.

     Summary: But on Aug. 2, 2017, signatures were quickly affixed, one from Hunter Biden, the other from a Chinese executive named Gongwen Dong.
On Capitol Hill, Democrats have dismissed earlier reports about Hunter Biden’s work in China as lacking credibility or being part of a Russian disinformation campaign.
The Chinese Embassy declined to comment on CEFC ties to the Chinese government or Hunter Biden’s involvement with the firm.
Shortly after Joe Biden left the vice presidency, Hunter Biden and Ye met over dinner in Miami.
The two had questioned several of Hunter Biden’s business expenses, asking for receipts to back up the charges.
