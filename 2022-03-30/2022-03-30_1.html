     Bruce Willis diagnosed with aphasia: The science behind the disorder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The actor just announced he is stepping away from his acting career due to difficulties he's having related to a diagnosis of the language disorder called aphasia.
Actor Bruce Willis, whose one-liners are a mainstay of blockbuster action movies, is stepping away from his career due to a diagnosis of aphasia, a neurological disorder that impacts language and speech, according to news reports.
People diagnosed with Wernicke aphasia, which is the most common type of fluent aphasia, have damage to the Wernicke area of the language-dominant part of the brain.
People with Wernicke aphasia also tend to have problems understanding what others are saying.
About 1 million individuals in the U.S. currently have aphasia, according to the National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The announcement that actor Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with aphasia is putting a spotlight on the condition — a disorder that can make it hard for a person to communicate.
There are at least 2 million people in the U.S. with the condition, according to the National Aphasia Association.
“Sentences do not hang together and irrelevant words intrude-sometimes to the point of jargon,” the National Aphasia Association noted.
Patients usually aren’t aware of their mistakes and have a hard time understanding what other people say.
Doctors are usually first to recognize it and can test a patient’s ability to carry on a conversation and follow commands.

     What is aphasia? Bruce Willis is 'stepping away' from acting after diagnosis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruce Willis' decision to end his acting career of more than four decades after a recent aphasia diagnosis has put a spotlight on the somewhat rare disorder.
It affects an estimated 2 million people in the United States, and nearly 180,000 acquire it each year, according to the National Aphasia Association.
"A lot of people have sort of a very slow and insidious onset of aphasia," Boxer said.
In the most serious cases, the condition can “make communication with the patient almost impossible,” according to the National Aphasia Association.
But the National Aphasia Association said complete recovery is unlikely if symptoms remain two or three months after a stroke.

     Summary: (NEXSTAR) – Bruce Willis is stepping away from acting after recently being diagnosed with aphasia, a condition that is “impacting his cognitive abilities,” according to a statement shared by his family.
Aphasia, which can cause varying degrees of impairment in speech or understanding language, currently affects more than 2 million Americans, the National Aphasia Association estimates.
The condition often results from a stroke or brain injury, but can develop over time due to brain tumors or progressive neurological disease.
Aphasia can affect people of any age, though most who are diagnosed are “middle-aged or older,” according to the National Institute of Health.
Willis’ family, including his wife, ex-wife and five daughters, had released a statement on Instagram announcing his diagnosis on Wednesday.
