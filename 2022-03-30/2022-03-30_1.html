     How Aphasia Steals the Ability to Communicate

     Summary: Bruce Willis, the film star known for his roles in “Die Hard” and “Pulp Fiction,” will step away from his decades-long movie career in the wake of a recent aphasia diagnosis.
Aphasia is a constellation of symptoms that make it difficult or impossible to express or comprehend language.
Aphasia can be devastating for patients, disrupting their ability to take part in everyday life.
All cases of aphasia stem from neurological changes in the brain.
Strokes resulting in brain damage are the number-one cause, said Dr. Shazam Hussain, director of the Cerebrovascular Center at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.

     Summary: Understanding aphasia, the condition impacting Bruce Willis' acting careertoggle caption ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty ImagesLegendary actor Bruce Willis announced Wednesday his departure from the big screen following his diagnosis with aphasia, which is "impacting his cognitive abilities," his family said in a statement.
While details of what led to Willis' aphasia diagnosis are unknown at this time, medical experts stress the importance of the brain condition and how its specifically treated — depending on its severity.
Aphasia is defined as a cognitive condition that affects the ability to speak, write and understand language, according to the Mayo Clinic.
But mainly, the condition affects a person's ability to communicate — whether it's written, spoken or both.
Most people living with aphasia are middle-aged or older, as the average age of those living with the condition is 70 years old.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The announcement that actor Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with aphasia is putting a spotlight on the condition — a disorder that can make it hard for a person to communicate.
There are at least 2 million people in the U.S. with the condition, according to the National Aphasia Association.
“Sentences do not hang together and irrelevant words intrude-sometimes to the point of jargon,” the National Aphasia Association noted.
Patients usually aren’t aware of their mistakes and have a hard time understanding what other people say.
Doctors are usually first to recognize it and can test a patient’s ability to carry on a conversation and follow commands.

     Summary: It affects an estimated 2 million people in the U.S., and nearly 180,000 acquire it every year, according to the National Aphasia Association.
It can also arise as a result of a head injury, a brain tumor, an infection or a degenerative disease like Alzheimer's.
"A lot of people have sort of a very slow and insidious onset of aphasia," Boxer said.
In the most serious cases, the condition can “make communication with the patient almost impossible,” according to the National Aphasia Association.
When it is mild, aphasia may affect just a single aspect of language use.
