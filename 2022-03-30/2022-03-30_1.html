    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The announcement that actor Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with aphasia is putting a spotlight on the condition — a disorder that can make it hard for a person to communicate.
There are at least 2 million people in the U.S. with the condition, according to the National Aphasia Association.
“Sentences do not hang together and irrelevant words intrude-sometimes to the point of jargon,” the National Aphasia Association noted.
Patients usually aren’t aware of their mistakes and have a hard time understanding what other people say.
Doctors are usually first to recognize it and can test a patient’s ability to carry on a conversation and follow commands.

     What is aphasia, the condition impacting Bruce Willis' acting career?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Bruce Willis is taking a break from acting due to a brain disorder called aphasia, "which is impacting his cognitive abilities," his family announced Wednesday .
People with aphasia can have problems finding words, use words out of order, speak in a choppy, halting manner or use short fragments of speech.
It can be difficult for people with aphasia to follow a fast talker, or understand complex sentences and concepts, ASHA said.
That's called "fluent" aphasia , as compared to "nonfluent" aphasia for those with more extensive damage.
Between 25% and 40% of stroke survivors acquire aphasia, according to the National Aphasia Association, with the elderly at highest risk.
