     What is aphasia? Condition Bruce Willis was diagnosed with affects communication
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aphasia is medical condition that leaves patients struggling to understand language and communicate.
These issues are related to brain damage in the left side of the brain, which controls language, Johns Hopkins explains.
While its presentations can vary, aphasia is usually a symptom of a broader medical issue.
In an Instagram post, Willis' family wrote that the condition "is impacting his cognitive abilities," but experts say aphasia is more accurately described as a language disorder than a cognitive illness.
"This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support," Willis' family said in a statement.
