“As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.”“We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him,” it continued.
“As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up,’ and together we plan to do just that.”The post is signed “Emma, Demi, Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel &amp; Evelyn” — referring to Emma Heming Willis, Willis’s wife, and his children.
Moore is the mother of Rumer, Scout and Tallulah, and Heming Willis is mother to Mabel and Evelyn.

     What is aphasia? Bruce Willis' condition explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The announcement that actor Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with aphasia is putting a spotlight on the condition — a disorder that can make it hard for a person to communicate.
There are at least 2 million people in the U.S. with the condition, according to the National Aphasia Association.
“Sentences do not hang together and irrelevant words intrude-sometimes to the point of jargon,” the National Aphasia Association noted.
Patients usually aren’t aware of their mistakes and have a hard time understanding what other people say.
Doctors are usually first to recognize it and can test a patient’s ability to carry on a conversation and follow commands.

     Summary: (NEXSTAR) – Bruce Willis is stepping away from acting after recently being diagnosed with aphasia, a condition that is “impacting his cognitive abilities,” according to a statement shared by his family.
Aphasia, which can cause varying degrees of impairment in speech or understanding language, currently affects more than 2 million Americans, the National Aphasia Association estimates.
The condition often results from a stroke or brain injury, but can develop over time due to brain tumors or progressive neurological disease.
Aphasia can affect people of any age, though most who are diagnosed are “middle-aged or older,” according to the National Institute of Health.
Willis’ family, including his wife, ex-wife and five daughters, had released a statement on Instagram announcing his diagnosis on Wednesday.

     Understanding the brain disorder affecting Bruce Willis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Bruce Willis is taking a break from acting due to a brain disorder called aphasia, "which is impacting his cognitive abilities," his family announced Wednesday .
How aphasia impacts a person can differ, based on the extent and site of damage in the brain.
Causes and treatmentCaused by damage to the language centers of the brain, aphasia is often the result of a traumatic brain injury, an infection or tumor in the brain, or a degenerative brain disease such as dementia, according to ASHA.
Between 25% and 40% of stroke survivors acquire aphasia, according to the National Aphasia Association, with the elderly at highest risk.
For those with milder forms of aphasia, treatment can be restorative, using speech therapy to retrain the brain to recognize words and speak and write.
