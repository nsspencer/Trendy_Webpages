    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

“To Bruce’s amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities,” Moore’s post reads.
“As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.”“We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him,” it continued.
“As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up,’ and together we plan to do just that.”The post is signed “Emma, Demi, Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel &amp; Evelyn” — referring to Emma Heming Willis, Willis’s wife, and his children.
Moore is the mother of Rumer, Scout and Tallulah, and Heming Willis is mother to Mabel and Evelyn.

     What is aphasia? Bruce Willis to step away from acting amid diagnosis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (NEXSTAR) – Bruce Willis is stepping away from acting after recently being diagnosed with aphasia, a condition that is “impacting his cognitive abilities,” according to a statement shared by his family.
Aphasia, which can cause varying degrees of impairment in speech or understanding language, currently affects more than 2 million Americans, the National Aphasia Association estimates.
The condition often results from a stroke or brain injury, but can develop over time due to brain tumors or progressive neurological disease.
Aphasia can affect people of any age, though most who are diagnosed are “middle-aged or older,” according to the National Institute of Health.
Willis’ family, including his wife, ex-wife and five daughters, had released a statement on Instagram announcing his diagnosis on Wednesday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The announcement that actor Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with aphasia is putting a spotlight on the condition — a disorder that can make it hard for a person to communicate.
There are at least 2 million people in the U.S. with the condition, according to the National Aphasia Association.
“Sentences do not hang together and irrelevant words intrude-sometimes to the point of jargon,” the National Aphasia Association noted.
Patients usually aren’t aware of their mistakes and have a hard time understanding what other people say.
Doctors are usually first to recognize it and can test a patient’s ability to carry on a conversation and follow commands.

     What is aphasia? And what causes it?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are varying types and severity of aphasia, but they typically fall into three types: expressive aphasia, comprehensive aphasia (also known as receptive, fluent or Wernicke's aphasia), and global aphasia.
As Ohio State neuropsychologist Tracy Shannon explains, expressive aphasia is almost like "tip-of-the-tongue syndrome times a thousand."
The Mayo Clinic explains that global aphasia is a combination of both expressive and comprehensive aphasia.
In other words, people with global aphasia will have trouble both understanding others and forming words.
Thus, if the Brocca's area is injured, people tend to form expressive aphasia, and if the Wernicke's area is injured, comprehensive aphasia is formed.

     What is aphasia? Bruce Willis is 'stepping away' from acting after diagnosis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruce Willis' decision to end his acting career of more than four decades after a recent aphasia diagnosis has put a spotlight on the somewhat rare disorder.
It affects an estimated 2 million people in the United States, and nearly 180,000 acquire it each year, according to the National Aphasia Association.
"A lot of people have sort of a very slow and insidious onset of aphasia," Boxer said.
In the most serious cases, the condition can “make communication with the patient almost impossible,” according to the National Aphasia Association.
But the National Aphasia Association said complete recovery is unlikely if symptoms remain two or three months after a stroke.
