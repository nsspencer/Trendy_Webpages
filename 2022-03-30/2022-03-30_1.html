    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

“To Bruce’s amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities,” Moore’s post reads.
“As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.”“We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him,” it continued.
“As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up,’ and together we plan to do just that.”The post is signed “Emma, Demi, Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel &amp; Evelyn” — referring to Emma Heming Willis, Willis’s wife, and his children.
Moore is the mother of Rumer, Scout and Tallulah, and Heming Willis is mother to Mabel and Evelyn.

     What is aphasia? And what causes it?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are varying types and severity of aphasia, but they typically fall into three types: expressive aphasia, comprehensive aphasia (also known as receptive, fluent or Wernicke's aphasia), and global aphasia.
As Ohio State neuropsychologist Tracy Shannon explains, expressive aphasia is almost like "tip-of-the-tongue syndrome times a thousand."
The Mayo Clinic explains that global aphasia is a combination of both expressive and comprehensive aphasia.
In other words, people with global aphasia will have trouble both understanding others and forming words.
Thus, if the Brocca's area is injured, people tend to form expressive aphasia, and if the Wernicke's area is injured, comprehensive aphasia is formed.

     Bruce Willis Diagnosed With Aphasia, ‘Stepping Away From Acting’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruce Willis, 67, is retiring from acting following a diagnosis of aphasia, his family revealed on social media.
Aphasia is a disorder that impacts the expression and understanding of language after damage to portions of the brain.
While fans are sad to hear of his retirement from acting, they’re thinking of the actor as he prioritizes his health amid his aphasia diagnosis.
Around 180,000 people are diagnosed with aphasia each year and are usually those aged 65 and older, the National Aphasia Association reports.
There are two broad categories of aphasia: fluent and non-fluent, but the most common type is Broca's, a subset of non-fluent aphasia.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The announcement that actor Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with aphasia is putting a spotlight on the condition — a disorder that can make it hard for a person to communicate.
There are at least 2 million people in the U.S. with the condition, according to the National Aphasia Association.
“Sentences do not hang together and irrelevant words intrude-sometimes to the point of jargon,” the National Aphasia Association noted.
Patients usually aren’t aware of their mistakes and have a hard time understanding what other people say.
Doctors are usually first to recognize it and can test a patient’s ability to carry on a conversation and follow commands.

     What is aphasia? Bruce Willis is 'stepping away' from acting after diagnosis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruce Willis' decision to end his acting career of more than four decades after a recent aphasia diagnosis has put a spotlight on the somewhat rare disorder.
It affects an estimated 2 million people in the United States, and nearly 180,000 acquire it each year, according to the National Aphasia Association.
"A lot of people have sort of a very slow and insidious onset of aphasia," Boxer said.
In the most serious cases, the condition can “make communication with the patient almost impossible,” according to the National Aphasia Association.
But the National Aphasia Association said complete recovery is unlikely if symptoms remain two or three months after a stroke.
