     Aurora borealis watch: Geomagnetic storm may flash northern lights across Massachusetts on Wednesday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The agency issued a geomagnetic storm watch on Tuesday into early Thursday morning.
Officials believe the majority of the lights will be visible late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning.
Officials said two or three CMEs occurred while the Sun was facing the Earth on Monday, a significant geomagnetic storm is expected.
Space Weather Watch predicts the Wednesday night lights to stretch from Washington all the way to Massachusetts.

     Will Chicago Be Able to See the Northern Lights Wednesday Night?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chicagoans could have the chance to see the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, Wednesday night, but will clouds clear for the extraordinary sight?
Aurora may be visible over the northern tier states if the conditions are favorable," the National Weather Service wrote.
pic.twitter.com/mIPY3wpIaV — Space Weather Watch (@spacewxwatch) March 29, 2022According to Space Weather Watch, clouds could impact visibility in some areas, though the upper Missouri Valley was clearing out as of Wednesday morning.
The NBC 5 Storm Team calculated rain continuing overnight into Thursday morning, which would make for near impossible circumstances to spot the Northern Lights from Chicago.
Especially over the northern Illinois border, a mix of rain and snow is likely to reduce visibility into the morning, according to the National Weather Service in Chicago.

     Aurora borealis to be visible in the U.S. after strong geomagnetic storm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ROANOKE, Va. – For many, the Aurora borealis (northern lights) is on the bucket list.
A strong geomagnetic (G3) storm will develop in response to a solar flare.
The strength of the storm, and the height in the atmosphere at which this happens, determines what colors become visible.
How the Aurora borealis formsOur chances of seeing the Aurora are slim to none, but if you head a little farther north, it’s possible to see low on the horizon Thursday morning.
Aurora borealis forecast for early Thursday morning, 3/31/2022A solar storm of this magnitude could even cause GPS and satellite disruptions.

     Northern Lights could glow over western Washington this week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following a strong geomagnetic storm, the Aurora Borealis could make an appearance over western Washington this week.
There is a chance the Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis, could put on a show Wednesday night into Thursday morning and again Thursday night into Friday morning in western Washington.
Western Washington needs clear or partially clear skies to see the lights, which can be tough to achieve this time of the year.
Fortunately, it does appear western Washington has a good chance to see enough breaks in the cloud cover overnight to allow for a chance to see the aurora tonight.
So if you have time late Wednesday night, get outside of the city and look at the northern horizon for the possibility to see the northern lights.
