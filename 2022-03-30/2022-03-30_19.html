     Aurora borealis to be visible in the U.S. after strong geomagnetic storm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ROANOKE, Va. – For many, the Aurora borealis (northern lights) is on the bucket list.
A strong geomagnetic (G3) storm will develop in response to a solar flare.
The strength of the storm, and the height in the atmosphere at which this happens, determines what colors become visible.
How the Aurora borealis formsOur chances of seeing the Aurora are slim to none, but if you head a little farther north, it’s possible to see low on the horizon Thursday morning.
Aurora borealis forecast for early Thursday morning, 3/31/2022A solar storm of this magnitude could even cause GPS and satellite disruptions.

     Northern Lights may grace Wyoming skies tonight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: — Lucky viewers just might glimpse the elusive aurora borealis, otherwise known as the northern lights, in Wyoming skies tonight.
The Kp-Index, which measures the horizontal distribution of the geomagnetic activity and the activity level of the Northern lights, is forecast at a 6-7 during those hours.
“Space weather is fickle and very unpredictable,” a National Weather Service spokesperson said in a video posted today.
To better your odds of seeing the lights, head north and go somewhere where skies are darkest.
Since the lights are more visible at northern latitudes, it might be best to head towards Grand Teton National Park.

     Will Chicago Be Able to See the Northern Lights Wednesday Night?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chicagoans could have the chance to see the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, Wednesday night, but will clouds clear for the extraordinary sight?
Aurora may be visible over the northern tier states if the conditions are favorable," the National Weather Service wrote.
pic.twitter.com/mIPY3wpIaV — Space Weather Watch (@spacewxwatch) March 29, 2022According to Space Weather Watch, clouds could impact visibility in some areas, though the upper Missouri Valley was clearing out as of Wednesday morning.
The NBC 5 Storm Team calculated rain continuing overnight into Thursday morning, which would make for near impossible circumstances to spot the Northern Lights from Chicago.
Especially over the northern Illinois border, a mix of rain and snow is likely to reduce visibility into the morning, according to the National Weather Service in Chicago.

Folks across the far northern U.S. could have a treat Wednesday night: the appearance of the aurora borealis, aka northern lights, in the night sky.
Thanks to a recent strong geomagnetic storm from the sun, the aurora might be visible in several northern states.
The storm is rated a "G3," which is the third level of NOAA's five-level solar storm scale.

     Northern Lights could glow over western Washington this week
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following a strong geomagnetic storm, the Aurora Borealis could make an appearance over western Washington this week.
There is a chance the Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis, could put on a show Wednesday night into Thursday morning and again Thursday night into Friday morning in western Washington.
Western Washington needs clear or partially clear skies to see the lights, which can be tough to achieve this time of the year.
Fortunately, it does appear western Washington has a good chance to see enough breaks in the cloud cover overnight to allow for a chance to see the aurora tonight.
So if you have time late Wednesday night, get outside of the city and look at the northern horizon for the possibility to see the northern lights.
