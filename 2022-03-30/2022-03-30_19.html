     Cricket-Asia chief Shah to help aid sport’s growth in Africa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MUMBAI (Reuters) – The Asian Cricket Council is set to play a role in helping grow the game in Africa through a plan prepared by ACC chief Jay Shah, a source told Reuters.
Shah, who is also the secretary of the powerful Indian cricket board (BCCI), is reviving the ‘Afro-Asian Cricket Project’, which was first mooted in 2005 by former International Cricket Council chief Jagmohan Dalmiya.
While the goal is the same, the new plan will approach it from a more “sustainable” angle, the source, a member of Shah’s team, said.
“Shah has proposed a model that is commercially viable, financially feasible and technically sustainable,” the source said.
At its annual general meeting held this month, the ACC extended Shah’s term as the president of the continental body by a year to 2024.

     Why Nigeria leads the way in YC’s participation in Africa – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s not a coincidence that TechCrunch has covered more African startups in the last year than any period in our history.
Many of those companies are Nigerian, and when we look at venture capital data, we can see why.
The country has posted steady progress in the last three years as the leading African startup market.
With 18 startups, it is the first African country to have the third-largest representation when categorized by country.
That’s a milestone for Nigeria, yes, but also an indication of how quickly the African startup scene has developed in a short period of time.

     To develop cricket in Africa, Jay Shah seeks to revive 'Afro-Asian' project
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW DELHI: BCCI secretary Jay Shah , who also heads the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), is keen on reviving the 'Afro-Asian' project to develop the game in the African continent.The project was first mooted in 2005 by the late Jagmohan Dalmiya but ended prematurely in 2009.Taking forward his vision for the growth and development of the game, Shah has initiated an ambitious plan aimed at taking the game global by opening up new avenues, including Africa.With Asia now being the game's biggest market, Shah wants to use its popularity in the region, its structure, and its technical expertise to reach out to African nations and help them strengthen their grassroots and age-group system.Both Asia and Africa now constitute 47 countries and with the African Cricket Association 's (AFC) member nations having a strong cricket following population of over 570 million, Shah's proposed project will ensure both ACC and AFC benefit from this unique partnership.Shah has proposed a model that is commercially viable, financially feasible and technically sustainable, according to a statement.The project will ensure that there is a real transformation at the grassroots level with age-group cricketers being the focus.The plan is formulated to give more opportunities to cricketers at U-16, U-19 and U-23 levels by having qualified coaches nurture and mentor them, and by having a strong competition layout where they have more game-time, and more importantly, get to test their skills against up-and-coming players from across the continent.

     Summary: By using its latest coherent technology, Ciena said EASSy is adding intelligence and efficiency to its cable system, maximising fibre capacity and substantially reducing the transported cost per bit.
“There’s a great need for affordable and reliable international connectivity in East Africa,” said Jacques Van Der Walt, procurement group chair at Telkom South Africa.
“We worked with Ciena to make our submarine cable network simpler and higher speed, allowing us to scale to unprecedented capacities at a lower overall cost.
The two firms believe network operators are continually expanding cloud-based services to create more connected communities, driving the need for subsea network upgrades globally.
“The Peace cable system is the highest-performing open cable system connecting Asia, Europe and Africa,” said Haitham Zahran, vice-president of EMEA subsea cable systems for PCCW Global.

     Africa’s struggle with hepatitis B
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The continent also lags behind the rest of the world in preventing hepatitis B through vaccination.
According to Kramvis, Africa’s lack of basic hepatitis B virus surveillance, limited access to laboratories and political inaction make addressing this issue tricky.
For such action to reach the people who need it, however, the widespread ignorance surrounding hepatitis B must be tackled head-on.
The prevalence of hepatitis B is estimated to be 4–6% of the population, but the exact figure is unknown.
Hepatitis B testing in Africa is frequently carried out in basic settings.Credit: Imperial College LondonThe pandemic has hampered hepatitis B programmes on a global scale.
