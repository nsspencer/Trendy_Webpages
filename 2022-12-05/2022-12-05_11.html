     Pelicans' Jose Alvarado sets franchise record for most points off bench with 38-point outburst vs. Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Orleans Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado had the best game of his young career against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday afternoon, and he made some franchise history in the process.
In 27 minutes of action, Alvarado scored 38 points while shooting 12 of 19 from the floor.
They were also the most scored by a bench player in Pelicans franchise history and the most scored by an undrafted player in franchise history, per Pelicans PR.
"I'm not a go out there and score big (player)," Alvarado said after the game.
It will be interesting to see if his big game propels him to be more aggressive on that end of the floor moving forward.

     Young Pelicans Phenom Had A Wonderful Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The player, who once went unsigned in the draft, scored a career-high 38 points on 63% from the field and 8-of-11 from the three-point line.
It wasn’t just a big night for Alvarado but the entire team, who won their fourth straight game.
Grand Theft AlvaradoThis is Alvarado’s second year in the league and it promises to be a very important one for the young star.
The Pelicans signed Alvarado as an undrafted free agent last year and he spent some time perfecting his skills in the G League.
ESPN says that Alvarado’s 38 are the most points ever scored by an undrafted player coming off the bench since 1970-1971.

Then Jose Alvarado came into the game.
https://t.co/ECyFmh605y — Pelican Debrief (@PelicanDebrief) December 4, 2022The New Orleans Pelicans are now 15-8 and alone in second place in the Western Conference, and Jose Alvarado has inserted himself into the 6th Man of the Year conversation.
New Orleans Pelicans: Jose Alvarado is more than just statsJose Alvarado already had a reputation around the league as a defensive pest and a guy who could disrupt a game with his on the ball defense and energy.
But it’s hard to measure what Jose really brings to the table in numbers, as we saw last night.

     Willy Hernangomez Battled Nikola Jokic To A Draw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2022 Eurobasket MVP Willy Hernangomez scored season-high 12 points and grabbed 8 rebounds to help the New Orleans Pelicans finish off a 121-106 home win over reigning NBA MVP Nikola Jokic's Denver Nuggets.
Jokic might have poured in 32 points to go along with 16 rebounds but the one-on-one matchup between the European stars was basically a draw.
Jokic got Valanciunas in foul trouble but Denver could not keep Hernangomez off of the free-throw line.
He also flirts with double-doubles every night he gets at least 15 minutes.
His per-36 averages of 20 points and almost 15 rebounds would have him starting on a team without championship aspirations.

     Summary: As I've said a million times before, I am a sucker for watching someone make NBA history.
It doesn't really matter to me who does it or what the NBA history is.
Jose Alvarado is the very definition of electric.
Not only does the "ole" chant play because the World Cup is going on, but obviously it fits Jose's name perfectly.
So shoutout Jose Alvarado, shoutout Pelicans fans, and most importantly shoutout David Griffin for what he's building.
