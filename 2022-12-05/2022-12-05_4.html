     Colts reportedly could be putting in a claim for Baker Mayfield
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Monday, Baker Mayfield was released by the Carolina Panthers and he has already been linked to several teams including the Indianapolis Colts.
This offseason, the Indianapolis Colts had a chance to go after Baker Mayfield but Indy opted to go with Matt Ryan.
Since it is so late in the season, Baker Mayfield has to go through the waiver wire before he actually becomes a free agent.
"I could definitely see a team like the Texans, Colts or Rams claiming him before he gets to the Niners" ~@RapSheet #PMSOverreactionMonday pic.twitter.com/8oxm1gtHKw — Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) December 5, 2022Would claiming Baker Mayfield make sense for Colts?
If neither of them put in a claim for Mayfield, he could be on his way to the Colts.

     Panthers release Baker Mayfield; could Niners claim QB off waivers?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Panthers released the quarterback on Monday morning, the team announced.
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport first reported the roster news, and Mayfield will now hit the waiver wire.
Mayfield's release came at the request of the 27-year-old, but there's plenty to unpack regarding his departure, starting with an underwhelming tenure as Carolina's starting quarterback.
The Panthers acquired Mayfield in July at what was considered to be the cheap price of a conditional fifth-round pick, giving Carolina its starting QB after a hollow training camp competition with Sam Darnold and P.J.
Intrigue remains in the days ahead for Mayfield, who could move to an NFC West team in need.

     Summary: When the the Carolina Panthers agreed in July to send a conditional 2024 draft pick to the Cleveland Browns for quarterback Baker Mayfield, the No.
Mayfield asked to be waived, but he likely would have been released soon anyway.
You could argue the Panthers didn't play to Mayfield's strengths like the Browns did in 2020 when they committed to the running game to take pressure off the quarterback.

     Panthers release Baker Mayfield
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mayfield started the first five games, but only won one of those (against the Saints in Week 3).
His best game was his first one, as he threw for a season-high 235 yards with a touchdown and an interception and an 84.6 passer rating against the Browns (a 26-24 loss).
A high ankle sprain against the 49ers opened the door for Walker to start and play well, and at that point, a return to the field seemed unlikely for Mayfield.
But when Walker was injured late in the Week 10 game against the Falcons, Mayfield got another shot.
He started against Baltimore, but threw a couple of late interceptions, and managed just 196 passing yards in the 13-3 loss.

     Summary: Speaking of Carolina …• The Panthers’ amicable split with Baker Mayfield makes sense for everyone involved.
Baker Mayfield may not be able to choose the next team he’ll play for.
All of it is pretty interesting, and even though Mayfield has struggled this year, he does remain an interesting player.
Bengals QB Joe Burrow has yet to lose to Patrick Mahomes in three NFL games against the MVP frontrunner.
Their dad’s given name was Craig, but football fans will remember him simply as Ironhead after he played for five NFL teams over 11 years.
