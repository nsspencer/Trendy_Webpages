     Recap: Brazil vs South Korea – World Cup 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Neymar has returned from injury to help Brazil thump South Korea 4-1, setting up a World Cup quarter-final clash against Croatia.
And while the game settled in the second period, it was never sluggish or scrappy, and a spirited South Korea fought hard to score a consolation goal in the 76th minute.
Just three minutes later, Richarlison was brought down by Jung Woo-young inside the box, and the referee pointed to the spot.
Just 10 minutes later, Vinicius Jr set up Lucas Paqueta with a cheeky chip, and the midfielder shot low and right.
A free kick for South Korea was bundled clear by the Brazilian defence, falling to Paik, who belted it past Alisson’s dive to find the top-right corner.

     Summary: Brazil 4-1 South Korea: One of the best first-half performances you're likely to see!
Do we need to talk about the second half?
Yes, South Korea caused their own problems by pushing so far up the pitch and leaving so few players back but Brazil still had to know how to exploit it and exploit it they did.
The second half was a non-event, with Brazil taking their foot off the gas and South Korea adopting a much less kamikaze approach.
But it was all about that first-half display, which will strike fear into the other nations left in the competition.

In that respect, South Korea played a fitting part in this contest as a brilliant Brazil took them to pieces.
Well, they have one centrally, about 30 yards out...54th minute: South Korea are 4-0 down and their best player has been their goalkeeper.
South Korea clearly haven't cracked the notion of damage limitation, leaving themselves 4 vs 4 at the back.
