     NJ mourns a favorite neighbor as tributes pour in for Sesame Street's Bob McGrath
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Sesame Workshop mourns the passing of Bob McGrath, a beloved member of the Sesame Street family for over 50 years," the nonprofit that oversees the show said in a Sunday announcement.
"There was never any distinction between Robert Emmett McGrath, the real, live human being, and Bob from Sesame Street, the fictional TV character.
McGrath lived in Teaneck with his wife, Ann, and their five children from 1958 until 2017, when they moved to Norwood.
If we had visitors over who wanted to get a photo with Bob McGrath, he was happy to pose.
He sang on Mitch Miller’s ’60s series "Sing Along With Mitch" and then made his acting debut on "Sesame Street."

     Bob McGrath, founding member of ‘Sesame Street’ cast, dies at 90
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bob McGrath, who played friendly music teacher Bob Johnson on “Sesame Street” for nearly five decades, died Dec. 4 at his home in New Jersey.
Mr. McGrath had spent much of the 1960s performing on TV and working as a folk singer in Japan.
Connell asked whether Mr. McGrath was interested in auditioning for a new children’s program he was working on.
After college, Mr. McGrath spent two years in the Army, then received a master’s degree from the Manhattan School of Music.
But the bulk of Mr. McGrath’s fame stemmed from “Sesame Street,” on which he appeared in more than 460 episodes.
