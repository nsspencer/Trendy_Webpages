     Summary: Michael Avenatti arrives at a federal court in Manhattan for a criminal case on Jan. 24 in New York City.
Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesIncarcerated lawyer Michael Avenatti was sentenced Monday to 14 years in federal prison "for stealing millions of dollars from his clients" and committing tax fraud, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California said.
The attorney's office said Avenatti blocked the "IRS’s efforts to collect more than $3 million in payroll taxes from an Avenatti-owned coffee busines."
Selna also ordered Avenatti to pay more than $10 million in restitution to four clients and to the IRS.
He is separately serving two prison sentences from prior convictions for stealing nearly $300,000 from his Daniels, and from attempting to extort Nike out of more than $20 million.

     Disgraced lawyer Michael Avenatti, onetime opponent of Donald Trump, sentenced to 14 years in fraud case

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disgraced lawyer Michael Avenatti was sentenced on Monday to 14 years in federal prison for defrauding his clients and for obstructing IRS efforts to collect payroll taxes from his coffee business.
Avenatti skyrocketed to celebrity status in 2018 alongside Daniels, his then-client and an adult film star, who filed multiple lawsuits -- unsuccessfully -- against then-President Donald Trump.
Michael Avenatti speaks to members of the media after leaving federal court on Feb. 4, 2022, in New York.
Authorities said that Avenatti told Johnson the money was not yet available and that he was "advancing" Johnson money to pay rent.
Yet the entire time, according to prosecutors, Avenatti had the $4 million and was using it for personal and business expenses.

     Summary: Lawyer Michael Avenatti speaks to the media after he walks out of federal court in New York, New York, U.S., March 25, 2019.
The judge also ordered Avenatti to pay more than $10.8 million in restitution to four clients and to the Internal Revenue Service.
Michael Avenatti, the brash lawyer who gained notoriety for legal actions involving former President Donald Trump , was sentenced Monday in California to 14 years in prison for stealing about $7.6 million from clients, as well as for tax fraud.
For months in 2018, Avenatti was a ubiquitous presence on television news shows, where he delighted in verbally skewering the president and Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen.
"He stole millions of dollars from his clients — all to finance his extravagant lifestyle that included a private jet and race cars," the top prosecutor said.

     Michael Avenatti sentenced to 14 years for cheating clients out of millions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The incarcerated lawyer Michael Avenatti was sentenced in southern California on Monday to 14 years in prison and ordered to pay $7m in restitution after admitting he cheated four of his clients out of millions of dollars.
He was accused of negotiating and collecting settlement payments on behalf of his clients and funneling the money to accounts he controlled.
Avenatti is serving time in a southern California prison on two separate cases.
In another instance, prosecutors said, Avenatti collected a $2.75m settlement payment for a client and used much of the money to buy a private airplane.
Prosecutors had asked for Avenatti to be sentenced to an additional 17.5 years in prison on top of the five he is already serving.

     Summary: The sentence imposed by U.S. District Judge James Selna in Santa Ana, California is in addition to the five years in prison that Avenatti, 51, was already serving for two unrelated convictions in Manhattan federal court.
Selna also ordered Avenatti to pay $10.8 million in restitution to the clients and the Internal Revenue Service.
"Michael Avenatti was a corrupt lawyer who claimed he was fighting for the little guy.
Prosecutors had sought a 17-1/2 year prison term, on top of the existing five years, after Avenatti pleaded guilty in June to five charges of wire fraud and obstruction.
When trying to help Daniels break a confidentiality agreement over her alleged affair with Trump, Avenatti became a fixture on cable TV news, attacking Trump and flirting with his own presidential run.
