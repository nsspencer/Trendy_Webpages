     Summary: Luis Miguel Echegaray praises Japan after Croatia ended their World Cup journey in the round of 16.
(1:05)Why Japan can be proud of World Cup campaign despite Croatia defeat (1:05)Croatia progressed into the World Cup quarterfinals after winning a penalty shootout over Japan on Monday following a hard-fought 1-1 draw in regulation time.
Daizen Maeda gave Japan the lead at the Al Janoub Stadium just before half-time when he pounced following a deep free-kick into the opposing penalty box.
That brought Japan out of their shells and Wataru Endo was soon firing in a long-range effort which Livakovic tipped over the bar.
Japan kept their nerve throughout the match but they crumbled in the penalty shootout as Nikola Vlasic and Marcelo Brozovic put Croatia 2-1 ahead before Pasalic sealed the deal for Croatia.
