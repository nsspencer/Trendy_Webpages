     Summary: AP Photo/Charles Rex ArbogastDuring an appearance on Serge Ibaka's show How Hungry Are You?, Aaron Rodgers revealed his list of the top five quarterbacks of all time.
The Green Bay Packers star initially said he would not include himself, but Ibaka convinced him to do so.
Rodgers then named the other four: Hall of Famers Joe Montana, Steve Young, Brett Favre and Tampa Bay Buccaneers signal-caller Tom Brady.
Rodgers also revealed he would pick Brady as the greatest ever because of his seven championship rings.

     Aaron Rodgers gets 100% real on his Top 5 quarterbacks of all time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa · 2 min readFor Green Bay Packers superstar Aaron Rodgers, there is no question who are the best quarterbacks in NFL history.
Rodgers immediately mentioned Tampa Bay Buccaneers signal-caller Tom Brady before naming NFL icons Joe Montana, Steve Young and Brett Favre.
While Aaron Rodgers has been often outshined by Tom Brady in the past, it is clear he has nothing but respect for the living legend.
Furthermore, there is no doubt that the Packers QB has huge admiration for Brett Favre, who was Green Bay’s QB before he arrived and took over the franchise.
Joe Montana is an obvious pick of course, though some would probably wonder why he put Steve Young so high on his list.

     Aaron Rodgers answers spicy questions, tries beer cheese soup (with goat brains) on Serge Ibaka's 'How Hungry Are You?'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Rodgers took a hard pass on crickets as a snack, but he did try the beer cheese soup ... with goat brains.
Ibaka, who is also a chef, whipped up a pot of hearty beer cheese soup, a classic Wisconsin comfort food, and then put a special Rodgers spin on it by adding goat brains.
Goat because he considers Rodgers the GOAT (Greatest of All Time), and brains because “the quarterback is the brain of the team,” Ibaka said.
Thoughtful planning in the kitchen aside, it wasn’t an easy sell to get Rodgers to pick up his soup spoon.
Who is the greatest Packers quarterback of all time, you or Brett Favre?

     Summary: NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers is the latest to chime in on the all-time best basketball player debate.
The conversation started with Serge Ibaka asking the Green Bay Packers QB who he thought was the best player ever at his position.
Keeping suit with Aaron Rodgers' thought process, the Milwaukee Bucks big man went with Bill Russell because he won 11 NBA titles.
I said best... Michael Jordan.
But you say Michael Jordan, but these days people say LeBron James, you know, like, it's not that simple."

     Summary: GREEN BAY, WISCONSIN - DECEMBER 19: Aaron Rodgers #12 of the Green Bay Packers warms up prior to playing the Los Angeles Rams at Lambeau Field on December 19, 2022 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
1 seed after Jalen Hurts injury by Scott RogustIn a scintillating interview with NBA star Serge Ibaka, Aaron Rodgers admits he is the greater Green Bay Packers quarterback between him and Brett Favre.
“Who’s the greatest Packers quarterback of all time: you or Brett Favre?” Ibaka asked.
Serge Ibaka got Aaron Rodgers to admit he’s the greatest Packers QB in recent historyAlthough Rodgers admitted that he’s surpassed his predecessor, he still honors Favre by including him among his top four NFL quarterbacks of all time.
Rodgers agrees Bart Starr was a Packers legend, but when it comes to the past 30 years in Green Bay, Rodgers accepts that he owns that title.
