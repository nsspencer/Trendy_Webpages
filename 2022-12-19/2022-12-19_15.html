     Eagles QB Jalen Hurts has right shoulder sprain, status in doubt for Saturday vs. Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia can clinch the NFC East with a win over the rival Cowboys on Saturday, but may have to manage without its star quarterback.
Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts suffered a sprained right shoulder in Sunday's win over the Bears and it's putting his status in doubt for Saturday's showdown versus Dallas, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport, Tom Pelissero and Mike Garafolo reported Monday, per sources.
Hurts didn't miss a snap during Sunday's win in Chicago but saw plenty of action rushing the ball, tying his season high in carries (17) amid a three-touchdown performance.
Hurts has passed for 3,472 yards and 22 TDs (five INTs) with a 104.6 passer rating while adding 747 rushing yards and 13 more TDs to his breakout season.
The news of Hurts' injury has already reached the Cowboys, who are looking to pay back a Week 6 defeat to the Eagles.

     Can the Eagles count on Gardner Minshew to maintain their top NFC standing?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If Hurts is ruled out for Week 16, here's what it means for Minshew and the Eagles.
How worried are the Eagles about Hurts missing time?
Fortunately, there are no alarm bells ringing inside the Eagles' NovaCare Complex about Hurts' long-term availability.
The Eagles have plenty of wiggle room, needing just one win over their remaining three regular season games to secure the top seed in the NFC.
As Jalen Hurts deals with a right shoulder sprain, all signs are pointing to Eagles backup quarterback Gardner Minshew getting the start in Week 15 against the Dallas Cowboys.

     Jalen Hurts injury: Gardner Minshew worth adding in Fantasy Football; A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith still starters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you were the person who took a chance on Jalen Hurts in your Fantasy Football drafts, there's a pretty good chance you've still got a lot to play for heading into Week 16.
1 seed against the Cowboys in Week 16.
Brown and DeVonta Smith – and potentially Dallas Goedert, who hopes to be back from IR in Week 16 – catching his passes, Minshew should be decent enough to matter for Fantasy.
Brown is still a top-12 WR for me this week, while Smith remains a top-20 option despite the tough matchup.
He's by far the best option available in the majority of CBS Fantasy leagues, and could end up being a very good starting option down the stretch.

What’s your reaction to the news of Hurts’ injury?
Hurts could suffer an injury in the pocket or on quarterback sneaks, so it’s not as if Philadelphia was inviting injury by playing this way.
This Hurts injury is a tough blow and will add drama to a stretch of the season that might have otherwise been devoid of it.
