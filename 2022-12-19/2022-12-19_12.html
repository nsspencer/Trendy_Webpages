     Japan's contribution to strengthening maternal health care in Helmand - Afghanistan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kabul, Afghanistan – The Government of Japan is contributing an additional USD 1.3 million to UNFPA’s response to the escalating crisis in Afghanistan to boost life-saving reproductive health interventions for women, girls and youth.
The new funding will support the continuation of services at 29 Family Health Houses in Helmand, strengthen the referral system for emergency maternal and newborn care, and support young people’s access to reproductive health and psychosocial support services and information.
The new funding brings to USD 2.2 million Japan’s total contribution to the 2022 UNFPA Afghanistan Humanitarian Response, which requires USD 251 million to reach 9.28 million of the most vulnerable population in the country with humanitarian assistance.
Japan’s support has reached more than 20,000 Afghans this year, mostly women and girls, with reproductive and maternal health services, psychosocial support, and distribution of Dignity Kits.
Japan has also contributed to the procurement of medical equipment and supplies for reproductive health, adequate to cover at least 102,000 people in need of reproductive health services in the country.

     Foreign workers killed working on U.S. bases likely didn't get compensation required by U.S., report says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tens of thousands of workers from Nepal, the Philippines and other developing countries took jobs at U.S. military bases in Afghanistan.
Called third-country nationals, or TCNs, because they were not from the U.S. or Afghanistan, they worked as cafeteria workers, janitors and often armed guards for the bases.
When a car bomb or other Taliban attack occurred, Afghans and TCN contractors “were far more likely to be killed or injured,” said the report.
During the interviews, Coburn and Gill found 12 different contract workers injured or killed who did not appear to have received proper compensation.
When contractors are found to have violated insurance requirements, there is little punishment, according to the report.
