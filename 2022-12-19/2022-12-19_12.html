     Twitter Deems Lakers 'Brutal to Watch' with LeBron James, More Out in Loss to Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesThe Los Angeles Lakers were without their star trio of LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook on Monday night against the Phoenix Suns, and the game played out exactly as expected.
The depleted Lakers limped to a 130-104 loss in a game where they trailed by as many as 27 points.
Los Angeles allowed Phoenix to blow the game open early, as the team didn't hold a lead after the 8:25 mark of the first quarter.
Los Angeles was doomed by its defense, as the Suns shot 51.3 percent from beyond the arc and got at least 15 points from all five of their starters.
Los Angeles (13-17) will look to bounce back when it visits the Sacramento Kings (16-12) on Wednesday.

     Community Shootaround: Los Angeles Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers reached the 30-game mark on Monday, as their depleted group got blown out by the Suns.
Los Angeles dropped a 13-17 record, 12th best in the Western Conference, and it’s going to be difficult to hang around in the postseason chase with Davis sidelined multiple weeks.
It’s uncertain just how long Davis will be out but naturally the Lakers will exercise plenty of caution for a superstar with a long history of injuries.
Just a couple of weeks ago, the Lakers’ prospects were a lot rosier.
Or should they stand pat and use the cap space they’ll gain from expiring contracts to revamp the roster next offseason?

     Anthony Davis Set To Miss An "Extended Period" Of Time For Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To make matters worse, they will now be without star big man Anthony Davis, who has been having an All-Star season to this point, due to a right foot injury.
On Sunday, it was reported that Davis is expected to miss about one month with this foot injury, but further updates have been given.
Talking about Anthony Davis and the Lakers recently on his podcast, ESPN’s Brian Windhorst stated that this is an injury that will force Davis to miss an “extended period” of time.
Anthony Davis’ health and his possible return to play is definitely a cause for concern for the Lakers right now, as they really do not have time to wait around.
Overall though, Windhorst’s update on Anthony Davis is something Lakers’ fans definitely did not want to hear.

     Lakers star Anthony Davis’ foot injury gets ‘concerning’ update
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa · 2 min readLos Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis’ injury could be worse than what fans initially feared.
NBA insider Brian Windhorst hinted as much in his recent talk in The Hoop Collective podcast, emphasizing that Davis’ injury is more than just a simple sprain that needs time to heal.
Anthony Davis suffered the injury during Friday’s game against the Denver Nuggets.
He was forced to exit early in the first half due to a right foot injury and wasn’t able to return.
To have this setback right now — I know it can be tough on him, for sure.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers announced that LeBron James (ankle soreness) and Austin Reaves (ankle sprain) will miss the second leg of the back-to-back.
The Lakers decision to rest LeBron can be viewed as precautionary.
“If it ain’t broke, go play,” Reaves said about his twisted ankle.
On a positive note, Wenyen Gabriel, who’s missed the past seven games with a shoulder sprain, is finally off the injury report.
Patrick Beverley, who sat out Sunday due to calf soreness, is questionable for the clash with his nemesis, Chris Paul.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsA year after the Los Angeles Lakers won just 33 games, they once again got off to a tumultuous start, going 2-10 to begin the season.
Missing their MVP of the season so far, the Lakers will be hard-pressed to maintain their recent momentum.
Even then, the Lakers may view the Davis injury as a reason to act quickly before their season takes a tumble.
Perhaps the Davis trade is the final shoe needed to drop for the Lakers to pull the trigger.

     Summary: When you reach the palatial estate of LaVar Ball, there is absolutely no denying whose home it is.
Back in 2017, many people believed LaVar Ball to be, at worst, crazy, and, at best – an overbearing father.
Fast forward five years later, and LaVar Ball must feel like a prophet.
Fully executing the vision, he sat out for his three sons well before the Ball family name became mainstream.
No matter how you may contextualize the careers of each Ball brother thus far, Lavar Ball had a vision for his sons and did everything in his willpower to assist.
