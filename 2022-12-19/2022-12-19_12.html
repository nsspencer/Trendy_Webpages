     Japan's contribution to strengthening maternal health care in Helmand - Afghanistan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kabul, Afghanistan – The Government of Japan is contributing an additional USD 1.3 million to UNFPA’s response to the escalating crisis in Afghanistan to boost life-saving reproductive health interventions for women, girls and youth.
The new funding will support the continuation of services at 29 Family Health Houses in Helmand, strengthen the referral system for emergency maternal and newborn care, and support young people’s access to reproductive health and psychosocial support services and information.
The new funding brings to USD 2.2 million Japan’s total contribution to the 2022 UNFPA Afghanistan Humanitarian Response, which requires USD 251 million to reach 9.28 million of the most vulnerable population in the country with humanitarian assistance.
Japan’s support has reached more than 20,000 Afghans this year, mostly women and girls, with reproductive and maternal health services, psychosocial support, and distribution of Dignity Kits.
Japan has also contributed to the procurement of medical equipment and supplies for reproductive health, adequate to cover at least 102,000 people in need of reproductive health services in the country.

     Finland's presence in Afghanistan motivated by relations with U.S.: researchers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, FIIA's research suggests that "Finland's activities in Afghanistan were motivated by multiple objectives that were partly unclear and at times conflicting."
Between 2001 and 2021, Finland stationed around 2,500 soldiers and 140 civilian crisis management experts in Afghanistan.
"It is ... difficult to appraise in retrospect how the different forms of participation deepened Finland's relations with the U.S., for example, and whether Finland's activities were cost-efficient in terms of its partnership goals and national capacities because no expectations had been explicitly stated," Mustasilta said.
Commenting on the report, Finnish national radio Yle noted that comparable surveys in Norway and Sweden had given similar results.
The FIIA report was based on 64 interviews with key Finnish decision makers and their colleagues.
