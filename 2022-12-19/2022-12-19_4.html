     WATCH LIVE: Jan. 6 committee, in final meeting, expected to refer Trump for criminal charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The committee is expected to make both criminal and civil referrals against the former president and his allies, who, according to lawmakers, broke the law or committed ethical violations.
The committee's chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said the referrals may include criminal, ethics violations, legal misconduct and campaign finance violations.
Lawmakers have suggested in particular that their recommended charges against Trump could include conspiracy to defraud the United State, obstruction of an official proceeding of Congress and insurrection.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday that he believes Trump committed multiple crimes.
Even though they are non-binding, the recommendations by the committee would add to the political pressure on the Justice Department as special counsel Jack Smith conducts an investigation into Jan. 6 and Trump’s actions.

     Summary: The House January 6 committee has discovered that lawyers connected to Donald Trump sought to influence witnesses with job offers and advice including that it was OK to lie to investigators.
She said: “The committee found that Mr Trump raised hundreds of millions of dollars with false representations made to his online donors.
In particular, the committee has learned that some of those funds were used to hire lawyers.
“As reports of the content of her testimony circulated, the witness believed this was an effort to perfect her testimony.
We are concerned that these efforts may have been a strategy to prevent the committee from finding the truth.”

     U.S. House Jan. 6 panel refers Trump for criminal charges, including inciting insurrection – Oregon Capital Chronicle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in a historic vote agreed unanimously Monday to refer former President Donald Trump and others to the Justice Department for potential criminal charges, including inciting or aiding an insurrection.
Committee members said that video came after more than three hours of inaction as Trump watched the attack.
Trump then sat in the White House dining room and watched as the attack unfolded, members of the panel said.
His actions violated a core principle of U.S. government, the two-century tradition of a peaceful transition of power, committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said.
Ethics Committee referralThe panel also referred Biggs, Jordan, Perry and McCarthy to their chamber’s ethics panel.

     The Latest Political Humiliation for Donald Trump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House select committee investigating the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, formally recommended to the Justice Department on Monday that former President Donald Trump be criminally prosecuted.
In a conversation with his adviser Kellyanne Conway, which took place the day after the riot, Trump downplayed the significance of the attack.
“They’re very upset.”The executive summary also includes new evidence demonstrating that Trump knew his claims about the 2020 election were false.
Some of the January 6th committee’s methods, including its effective use of snippets of testimony in videos produced for public airing, have prompted complaints about selective editing.
And, now, with its criminal referrals, the committee has placed Trump in a position of political ignominy occupied by no other American President.

     What the Jan. 6 panel cited for each criminal referral against Trump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol referred former President Trump to the Justice Department on four separate charges Monday, marking a momentous step in the panel’s year-plus probe of the Capitol riot.
The panel recommended that the Justice Department investigate Trump for inciting, assisting, or aiding and comforting an insurrection; obstructing an official proceeding; conspiracy to defraud the United States; and conspiracy to make a false statement.
The referrals, while significant, are largely symbolic in nature because the Justice Department is not obliged to take up recommendations from the committee.
The committee said it based its referrals on “sufficient evidence” showing that Trump violated the statues listed.
The Justice Department, however, had already concluded that there was no factual basis to argue that the election had been stolen, according to the executive summary.

     Summary: and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) — both strong critics of former President Trump — took seats on the panel.
The panel accused Trump of four crimesThe big question that had hung over the committee’s work — would it formally assert that Trump should be criminally prosecuted?
“I’m convinced the Justice Department will charge former President Trump,” committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.)
Several committee members have emphasized that they believe themselves to be working in part for history’s sake.
But even if the politics don’t change, the panel’s work has clearly added to the historical record.

     Did the January 6 Committee Finish Trump?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the committee seemed to be more concerned with what might happen after the midterms to Trump and his criminal associates.
The committee’s work may have made a repetition of January 6 all but impossible.
This was the final round of the battle between House Democrats and Trump.
It’s sometimes difficult to remember that the committee’s investigation concludes a four-year battle between House Democrats and Trump that included two impeachments and now criminal referrals.
But the committee report — and its use of enduring images that ought to shame anyone who ever supported Trump — will represent a solid legacy to all who participated.
