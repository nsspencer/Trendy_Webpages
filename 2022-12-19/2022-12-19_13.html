     Lakers Injury Update: Patrick Beverley Playing; LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, Austin Reaves &amp; Anthony Davis Out Against Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers announced that Russell Westbrook (left foot soreness), Anthony Davis (foot), LeBron James (left ankle soreness) and Austin Reaves (right ankle sprain) are out on Monday night against the Phoenix Suns.
L.A. is getting Patrick Beverley (right calf soreness) back, however, after a one-game absence.
He missed the last two games with an ankle injury and was originally listed as questionable before being deemed healthy enough to play.
Starting alongside Beverley for the Lakers is Dennis Schroder, Lonnie Walker IV, Troy Brown Jr. and Thomas Bryant.
Davis to potentially miss significant timeDavis’ injury is the most concerning for the Lakers as he will reportedly miss around a month with a foot injury, although the exact diagnosis has not yet been announced.

     LeBron James gets injury update for Lakers-Suns showdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers announced that LeBron James (ankle soreness) and Austin Reaves (ankle sprain) will miss the second leg of the back-to-back.
The Lakers decision to rest LeBron can be viewed as precautionary.
“If it ain’t broke, go play,” Reaves said about his twisted ankle.
On a positive note, Wenyen Gabriel, who’s missed the past seven games with a shoulder sprain, is finally off the injury report.
Patrick Beverley, who sat out Sunday due to calf soreness, is questionable for the clash with his nemesis, Chris Paul.

     Community Shootaround: Los Angeles Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers reached the 30-game mark on Monday, as their depleted group got blown out by the Suns.
Los Angeles dropped a 13-17 record, 12th best in the Western Conference, and it’s going to be difficult to hang around in the postseason chase with Davis sidelined multiple weeks.
It’s uncertain just how long Davis will be out but naturally the Lakers will exercise plenty of caution for a superstar with a long history of injuries.
Just a couple of weeks ago, the Lakers’ prospects were a lot rosier.
Or should they stand pat and use the cap space they’ll gain from expiring contracts to revamp the roster next offseason?

     LaVar Ball on LaMelo Ever Joining the Los Angeles Lakers: ‘Hell No’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When you reach the palatial estate of LaVar Ball, there is absolutely no denying whose home it is.
Back in 2017, many people believed LaVar Ball to be, at worst, crazy, and, at best – an overbearing father.
Fast forward five years later, and LaVar Ball must feel like a prophet.
Fully executing the vision, he sat out for his three sons well before the Ball family name became mainstream.
No matter how you may contextualize the careers of each Ball brother thus far, Lavar Ball had a vision for his sons and did everything in his willpower to assist.
