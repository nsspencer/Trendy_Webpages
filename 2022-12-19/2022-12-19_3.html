     Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts suffered right shoulder sprain, sources say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts suffered a sprained right shoulder and his status for Philadelphia’s game at Dallas is uncertain, a person with knowledge of the matter told The Associated Press on Monday.
The 24-year-old morphed into a serious NFL MVP candidate in his second season as a starter.
Hurts has thrown 22 touchdowns and has 3,472 yards passing, and he has rushed for 747 yards and 13 touchdowns.
Philadelphia’s sensational season means the Eagles can play it safe and rest Hurts so he is ready for the playoffs.
Now the Eagles likely will have to do the same as they prepare to play without Hurts.

What’s your reaction to the news of Hurts’ injury?
Hurts could suffer an injury in the pocket or on quarterback sneaks, so it’s not as if Philadelphia was inviting injury by playing this way.
This Hurts injury is a tough blow and will add drama to a stretch of the season that might have otherwise been devoid of it.

“If I’m Jalen Hurts’ agent, there’s not a snowball’s chance in hell we signing anytime soon … Because if you win the MVP, and the Eagles win the Super Bowl, and you win the Super Bowl MVP.
You write your own number.”Joyner suggested Hurts should wait to see what kind of contract former NFL MVP Lamar Jackson gets from the Baltimore Ravens.
Banner also suggested Hurts should look for a three-year deal.

So it’s understandable that head coach Nick Sirianni and play caller Shane Steichen want to take advantage of Hurts’ running ability.
And Sanders even has a higher rushing average than Hurts – 5.2 for Sanders, 4.8 for Hurts.
And really, Hurts needs to take some responsibility in all of this, too.
But this offense can function at a high level without Hurts running 17 times.
