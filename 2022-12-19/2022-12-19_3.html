     Summary: State of play: The Arctic front was inching its way south through the Northwest and Northern Plains with "bitterly cold temperatures" reported in parts of Montana overnight, per an NWS update.
Between the lines: Some areas will see record cold temperatures, though this does not look like an all-time cold outbreak for much of the country.
What's next: The forecast for certain cities in the path of the extreme cold helps illustrate what is to come.
In Des Moines, Wednesday's high looks to be just 16°F, with a low of minus-2°F.
The NWS is warning of "extensive" travel delays throughout the Midwest and East due to this storm system, during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.

     Summary: We are still on track for a major winter storm later this week that will strongly impact holiday travel.
The European model has insisted for the past two days that we’ll get rain first, then transition to snow on Friday.
The Canadian model’s storm track has been similar to the European model for the past couple of days, and that hasn’t changed with the latest model run.
How soon that changeover occurs is also important (the European model changes us over a little quicker than the American model).
Something else we need to monitor is the potential for Lake Michigan lake effect snow bands.
