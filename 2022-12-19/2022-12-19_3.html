     January 6 committee: What's next for Trump legally and politically
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Already, there are indications that Mr Trump may be facing increasingly stiff political headwinds as he tries to gear up another bid for the presidency in 2024.
Recent polls show that he continues to be unpopular with vast swaths of the American public, and that his support is dropping even among Republican voters.
Hypothetical head-to-head election matchups show him losing ground to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for the Republican presidential nomination and trailing Mr Biden in a general election contest.

     Trump lawyer John Eastman referred for prosecution by Jan. 6 committee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "The evidence shows that Eastman knew in advance of the 2020 election that Vice President Pence could not refuse to count electoral votes on January 6th," the committee wrote in an executive report issued Monday.
Instead, Eastman said, he had recommended that the vice president merely delay certifying the electoral count.
Eastman and Trump repeatedly attempted to convince Pence to comply with the scheme, but he ultimately refused.
An aide to Pence later told the committee during a taped interview that Eastman knew the plan he was proposing was illegal, because it would violate the federal Electoral Count Act.
"But he thought that we could do so, because in his view, the Electoral Count Act was unconstitutional," the aide, Greg Jacob said.

     The Jan. 6 committee is abandoning efforts to subpoena phone records as it wraps up its investigation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House select committee investigating the Capitol riot is dropping several of its pursuits for Jan. 6-related phone records, according to court filings last week, as the panel winds down before it expires at the end of this year.
The committee sent out dozens of subpoenas seeking call logs, including to major phone companies, as part of its investigation into Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election result.
“On December 12, 2022, Plaintiffs were informed by counsel for the Select Committee that the Select Committee will be withdrawing the subject subpoena issued by the Committee,” one court filing, from lawyers representing members of the Oath Keepers extremist group, wrote in one recent request to drop a lawsuit.
Some of the subpoenas were issued a year ago.The committee declined to comment.
While these witnesses and some others successfully blocked the committee from obtaining their phone records, the panel was able to access unprecedented amounts of information in their investigation, including through other phone records subpoenas, other document requests and witness interviews.

     Jan. 6 committee formally accuses Donald Trump of 4 crimes

     Summary: ), chair of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol, speaks with reporters after the committee's final meeting on Capitol Hill on Dec. 19, 2022.
If the faith is broken, so is our democracy,” said select panel chair Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.).
The committee’s evidence suggested Trump had been briefed that many members of the crowd were armed even before he issued his directive.
The select committee’s report is the culmination of a process that was never supposed to exist.
Several inflection points helped turn the committee from a question mark into a force that Trump world had to reckon with.

     Summary: Here are takeaways from the committee’s final public meeting:Committee refers Trump to DOJFor months, the committee went back-and-forth over whether it would refer Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.
The committee referred Trump to DOJ on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.
Monday’s presentation was a compelling closing salvo for the committee, which said Trump sought to break “the foundation of American democracy.”“Donald Trump broke that faith.
He lost the 2020 election and knew it.
And that is the core of Trump’s critiques of the committee – that it is stacked with Trump haters.
