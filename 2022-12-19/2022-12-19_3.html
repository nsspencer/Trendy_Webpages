     Summary: We've got some discord in the Cowboys locker room over the MVP-worthiness of an Eagles quarterback, right after Dallas lost a heartbreaker in overtime?
Less than a week after Cowboys All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons went on record shading Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts' MVP chatter, it seems Parsons' teammate Trevon Diggs has different thoughts.
Parsons didn't really hide his feelings:"PARSONS: When you look at the Eagles, is it Hurts or the team?
Fast forward to Monday morning and you have Cowboys All-Pro cornerback Trevon Diggs commenting on Hurts' Instagram with a different message:Now, this shouldn't be terribly surprising.
For what it's worth, Hurts is the odds-on favorite to win MVP for the second straight week according to NBC Sports' sports betting partner PointsBet.

     Eagles’ Jalen Hurts suffers shoulder sprain, in doubt for Cowboys game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts suffered a right (throwing) shoulder sprain against the Bears and his status for Saturday’s game in Dallas is in doubt, a league source confirmed to NBC Sports Philadelphia.
All 263 pounds of Gipson landed on top of Hurts and drove his right shoulder into the frozen grass.
He had a passer rating of 133.7 in the Eagles’ 33-18 win to get them to 6-7 before the bye week.
If the Eagles win on Saturday, they'd clinch the top seed in the NFC.
He’s one rushing touchdown shy of Cam Newton’s record for QB rushing touchdowns in a season from 2011.
