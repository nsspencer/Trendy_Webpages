     Instant takeaways from the Commanders loss to the NY Giants
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Washington Commanders fell flat in the biggest game of the Ron Rivera era, losing 20-12 to the New York Giants on Sunday night.
The loss gives the tiebreaker to the Giants, effectively putting Washington two games behind New York.
The Commanders’ playoff chances would’ve been at 91% with a win, and they sit at 34% right now with a loss.
They are an average, that was thoroughly outplayed by a less talented, sputtering New York Giants team at home.
Brian Daboll and the New York Giants deserve a lot of credit but this one will sting in the nation’s capital.

     Giants report card: How we graded Big Blue in Week 15 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the offense only scored 13 points in this contest it was enough to get the job done.
Daniel Jones was not sacked once in this game compared to four times last game which allowed New York to put together long drives that drained the clock and the Washington defense.
Saquon Barkley also improved a lot in this game from the last as he only recorded 81 scrimmage yards and 3.5 yards per carry in Week 13 compared to 120 scrimmage yards and 4.8 yards per carry in Week 15.
However, things were not all sunshine and rainbows for this offense as they tied a season-low in points scored.
This offense will have an opportunity to improve next week against a Minnesota Vikings defense that ranks among the worst in the NFL.

     Officials Explain Two Crucial Non-Calls at End of Giants-Commanders Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Both Giants fans and Washington fans will certainly agree with that, especially after last night's game in the Giants topped Washington 20-12 in a game that had two controversial noncalls at the end of the game that arguably could have affected the outcome had they gone the other way.
The penalty was still called and ultimately took a touchdown off of the board for Washington.
Hussey said the officials do not have to say whether a player is lined up correctly or not.
So, I can’t confirm whether the official even saw that or not, but he was clearly off the line of scrimmage.”The penalty took Washington from the 1-yard line to the 6-yard line.
"To the officials, it didn’t rise to what they felt was a restriction; thus, they didn’t call it.

     Giants' Kayvon Thibodeaux Fulfilling Draft Expectations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fifth-overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft is starting to round into the player the Giants hoped to be getting.
Even after returning to the lineup, Thibodeaux was still trying to find his footing between adjusting to the game's speed and managing his injury.
In his first six games (before the bye), Thibodeaux posted 15 tackles, one quarterback hit, one sack, one forced fumble, and three passes defensed.
“I think us, as a team, took it upon ourselves to call our fights," Thibodeaux said after the game.
Like his big strip-sack, a forced fumble, and scoop-and-score.

     Giants-Commanders ‘Kudos &amp; Wet Willies’: Lots of credit to go around after key victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is plenty of credit to go around for the New York Giants’ 20-12 victory over the Washington Commanders on Sunday night.
Let’s get to our traditional ‘Kudos &amp; Wet Willies’ review and see who earned it.
Richie James — I said recently that James had developed a talent for compiling meaningless catches once games were out of hand.
Jones was never sacked, but he stood in the pocket and took punishment from the Washington pass rushers when he had to.
Wet Willies to ...Darius Slayton — The wide receiver was targeted on Jones’ first two throws, and couldn’t come up with either well-thrown pass.
