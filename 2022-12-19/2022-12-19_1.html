     Green Bay Packers inactives list vs. the Rams: What to Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Green Bay Packers released their inactives prior to Monday Night’s game with the Los Angeles Rams, and because the injury report was so sparse, there really weren’t any surprises.
With no practice squad elevations made this week, the inactives included Shemar Jean-Charles, David Bakhtiari, Caleb Jones, Krys Barnes, and Jonathan Ford.
Since returning from injury, Jean-Charles has been inactive, likely because of Innis Gaines being added to the 53-man roster and taking over special teams responsibilities.
Jones, meanwhile, has just returned from the NFI list and Ford has been inactive all season.
Perhaps Barnes’ inactive status is the most surprising, but this happened in Chicago as well with De’Vondre Campbell back on the field and depth not as much of a concern.

     2022 NFL season, Week 15: What We Learned from Packers' win over Rams on Monday night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This time around, it was good enough, thanks in part to a productive night from the Packers' one-two backfield punch of Aaron Jones and AJ Dillon.
If the Packers are going to run the table, they're going to need this type of performance every week.
The Packers have not lived up to expectations on this side of the ball this season, entering Week 15 as the NFL's 18th-ranked defense (including 30th against the run).
Los Angeles' hopes of a title defense faded away weeks ago, and Green Bay's win officially eliminated the Rams from postseason contention.
This needs to be a building block for the Packers, not a bright spot in a season that ends up drifting toward disappointment.
