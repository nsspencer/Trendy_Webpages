     Green Bay Packers inactives list vs. the Rams: What to Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Green Bay Packers released their inactives prior to Monday Night’s game with the Los Angeles Rams, and because the injury report was so sparse, there really weren’t any surprises.
With no practice squad elevations made this week, the inactives included Shemar Jean-Charles, David Bakhtiari, Caleb Jones, Krys Barnes, and Jonathan Ford.
Since returning from injury, Jean-Charles has been inactive, likely because of Innis Gaines being added to the 53-man roster and taking over special teams responsibilities.
Jones, meanwhile, has just returned from the NFI list and Ford has been inactive all season.
Perhaps Barnes’ inactive status is the most surprising, but this happened in Chicago as well with De’Vondre Campbell back on the field and depth not as much of a concern.

     Week 15 MNF Staff Picks: Rams at Packers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To wrap up week 15 we have the Los Angeles Rams heading out to Green Bay to take on the Packers.
Baker Mayfield shocked the NFL world last week by winning a game in which he had had access to the playbook for somewhere close to only about 48 hours.
Now he gets a full week of preparation to take on the 5-8 Packers on the road.
The Packers meanwhile are fighting for their playoff lives tonight.
Anyway, here are Michael and I’s picks.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
