     Green Bay Packers inactives list vs. the Rams: What to Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Green Bay Packers released their inactives prior to Monday Night‚Äôs game with the Los Angeles Rams, and because the injury report was so sparse, there really weren‚Äôt any surprises.
With no practice squad elevations made this week, the inactives included Shemar Jean-Charles, David Bakhtiari, Caleb Jones, Krys Barnes, and Jonathan Ford.
Since returning from injury, Jean-Charles has been inactive, likely because of Innis Gaines being added to the 53-man roster and taking over special teams responsibilities.
Jones, meanwhile, has just returned from the NFI list and Ford has been inactive all season.
Perhaps Barnes‚Äô inactive status is the most surprising, but this happened in Chicago as well with De‚ÄôVondre Campbell back on the field and depth not as much of a concern.
