The European model has insisted for the past two days that we’ll get rain first, then transition to snow on Friday.
The Canadian model’s storm track has been similar to the European model for the past couple of days, and that hasn’t changed with the latest model run.
How soon that changeover occurs is also important (the European model changes us over a little quicker than the American model).
Something else we need to monitor is the potential for Lake Michigan lake effect snow bands.
