     Eagles’ Jalen Hurts sprained shoulder vs. Bears, per source: Will he play again in the regular season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts suffered a sprained shoulder that’s not considered a long-term injury Sunday in Philadelphia’s game against the Bears, a league source confirmed to The Athletic on Monday.
Early indications, according to a report by The Philadelphia Inquirer, are that Hurts could be out for the next two weeks.
If Hurts does not play, the Eagles would turn to fourth-year quarterback Gardner Minshew.
He started two games with the Eagles last season, including one game with the starters.
Minshew has started 22 games in his career and has thrown 41 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts suffered a right (throwing) shoulder sprain against the Bears and his status for Saturday’s game in Dallas is in doubt, a league source confirmed to NBC Sports Philadelphia.
All 263 pounds of Gipson landed on top of Hurts and drove his right shoulder into the frozen grass.
He had a passer rating of 133.7 in the Eagles’ 33-18 win to get them to 6-7 before the bye week.
If the Eagles win on Saturday, they'd clinch the top seed in the NFC.
He’s one rushing touchdown shy of Cam Newton’s record for QB rushing touchdowns in a season from 2011.

     Summary: Philadelphia can clinch the NFC East with a win over the rival Cowboys on Saturday, but may have to manage without its star quarterback.
Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts suffered a sprained right shoulder in Sunday's win over the Bears and it's putting his status in doubt for Saturday's showdown versus Dallas, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport, Tom Pelissero and Mike Garafolo reported Monday, per sources.
Hurts didn't miss a snap during Sunday's win in Chicago but saw plenty of action rushing the ball, tying his season high in carries (17) amid a three-touchdown performance.
Hurts has passed for 3,472 yards and 22 TDs (five INTs) with a 104.6 passer rating while adding 747 rushing yards and 13 more TDs to his breakout season.
The news of Hurts' injury has already reached the Cowboys, who are looking to pay back a Week 6 defeat to the Eagles.

     Eagles escaped disaster but must be more careful with Jalen Hurts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So it’s understandable that head coach Nick Sirianni and play caller Shane Steichen want to take advantage of Hurts’ running ability.
And Sanders even has a higher rushing average than Hurts – 5.2 for Sanders, 4.8 for Hurts.
And really, Hurts needs to take some responsibility in all of this, too.
But this offense can function at a high level without Hurts running 17 times.
But Sirianni and Steichen – and Hurts – need to figure out a smarter balance between risk and reward.

BUY EAGLES TICKETS: STUBHUB, VIVID SEATS, TICKETSMARTER, TICKETMASTERAfter the game, former Eagles linebacker Seth Joyner addressed Hurts’ contract status, with MVP candidate scheduled for free agency in 2024.
“If I’m Jalen Hurts’ agent, there’s not a snowball’s chance in hell we signing anytime soon … Because if you win the MVP, and the Eagles win the Super Bowl, and you win the Super Bowl MVP.
You write your own number.”Joyner suggested Hurts should wait to see what kind of contract former NFL MVP Lamar Jackson gets from the Baltimore Ravens.
Banner also suggested Hurts should look for a three-year deal.

     Summary: Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts got X-rays after the team's win over the Chicago Bears on Sunday.
Presumably, it was on the shoulder that Hurts injured during the game, but those details are not yet known.
After the Eagles' win in Chicago over the Bears on Sunday, paired with the Dallas Cowboys' loss in Jacksonville to the Jaguars, the Eagles all but locked up the 1 seed in the NFC playoffs.
In other words, if the X-rays revealed a noteworthy injury, he would have some time to recover.
Again, information here is sparse, but at a minimum, the team felt that whatever injury Hurts sustained against the Bears was worthy of X-rays.
