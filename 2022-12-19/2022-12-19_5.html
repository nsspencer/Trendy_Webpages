     Summary: Pope Francis, who turned 86 on Saturday, shared in an interview published Sunday that he wrote a resignation letter in 2013 in case medical problems impede him from carrying out his duties.
Pope Francis, in an interview with Spanish newspaper ABC, submitted the letter to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who then was the Vatican secretary of state.
Francis had surgery in 2021 to repair a bowel narrowing and has been hobbled by knee pain that for months saw him use a wheelchair.
The topic was raised when Francis was asked what happens if a pope is unable to do his job due to injury or illness.
“I signed it and said: ‘If I should become impaired for medical reasons or whatever, here is my resignation.
