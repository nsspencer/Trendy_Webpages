     Summary: Phoenix Suns SG Devin Booker will not play against the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night.
When the Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Lakers square off later tonight, a handful of big names will be missing in action.
While we already knew Lakers big man Anthony Davis was recently ruled out for a month with a foot injury, Suns shooting guard Devin Booker was just ruled out with groin soreness.
Booker previously missed two games with a hamstring injury, but managed to return and help the Suns win consecutive games which included a 58-point performance on Saturday.

     2 trades Lakers must make ASAP after Anthony Davis’ injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Owen Crisafulli · 4 min readThe Los Angeles Lakers are trying to turn their season around after a horrid start to their campaign.
Things seemed to be on the rise for the Lakers, but they were dealt a crushing blow when star center Anthony Davis was ruled out for a month due to a foot injury.
In order to salvage that progress, the Lakers are going to need to move quickly to shore up their roster in Davis’ absence.
Now that he’s out, Los Angeles is relying on Thomas Bryant and Damian Jones as their big-man rotation, which is less than ideal.
Prior to Davis’ injury, there were legit reasons for the Lakers to avoid making this deal.

     Summary: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsA year after the Los Angeles Lakers won just 33 games, they once again got off to a tumultuous start, going 2-10 to begin the season.
Missing their MVP of the season so far, the Lakers will be hard-pressed to maintain their recent momentum.
Even then, the Lakers may view the Davis injury as a reason to act quickly before their season takes a tumble.
Perhaps the Davis trade is the final shoe needed to drop for the Lakers to pull the trigger.

     Lakers Vs. Suns Preview: LeBron James, Austin Reaves &amp; Anthony Davis Out In Second Of Back-To-Back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers look to extend their winning streak to three on Monday night when they travel to take on the Phoenix Suns.
Both teams will be shorthanded in this one as the Lakers are without Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Austin Reaves, and Juan Toscano-Anderson in the second of a back-to-back.
Davis injured his foot in Friday night’s win over the Denver Nuggets and is expected to miss at least a few weeks.
In his absence, it will be up to Thomas Bryant to continue stepping up as the Lakers’ starting center.
Meanwhile, James is sitting out the second of the back-to-back while Reaves is dealing with an ankle sprain that the suffered against the Wizards.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementThe Lakers have yet to provide an official update on Davis’ injury, but head coach Darvin Ham said Davis was evaluated by specialists Sunday night.
There are natural follow-up questions regarding the Lakers’ trade ambitions: How will Davis’ injury affect their trade activity?
They won their second straight game since Davis’ injury, defeating the Washington Wizards 119-117 on Sunday night.
Hours earlier, Ham was also asked before the game if he thinks Davis’ injury changes the team’s trade approach.
“I’m having a good race with Father Time right now as you can see in some of the commercials this season,” James said.

     Summary: When you reach the palatial estate of LaVar Ball, there is absolutely no denying whose home it is.
Back in 2017, many people believed LaVar Ball to be, at worst, crazy, and, at best – an overbearing father.
Fast forward five years later, and LaVar Ball must feel like a prophet.
Fully executing the vision, he sat out for his three sons well before the Ball family name became mainstream.
No matter how you may contextualize the careers of each Ball brother thus far, Lavar Ball had a vision for his sons and did everything in his willpower to assist.

     Summary: The Lakers have struggled in minutes without Davis all season.
So what sort of moves are available to the Lakers as they try to stay afloat without Davis?
This should be the expectation for any other big-ticket trade trade targets right now.
It doesn't matter how good Davis is if the Lakers fall out of the playoff race without him.
The Lakers have lost Westbrook's fourth-quarter minutes by 78 points this season and won their fourth-quarter minutes without him by 66.
