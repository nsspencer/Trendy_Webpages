     Snow is expected in the Olympia area this week, but how much?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Word of the week: Uncertainty https://t.co/FP3CdmSFWD — Jacob DeFlitch (@WxDeFlitch) December 17, 2022The Olympia area is expected to see between 1 and 3 inches of snow by Tuesday, but that could go up or down, Meteorologist Jacob DeFlitch said Monday.
The high for Tuesday is 38 degrees and the low is expected to be 23 degrees.
The wintry mix is expected to let up on Wednesday, but the low will be in the teens, DeFlitch said.
The low temperatures will continue into Thursday and likely bring snow along with them, which could continue into the weekend.
DeFlitch said there’s another weather system moving in later this week that may bring another mess of rain, snow and cold temperatures.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It looks like the Seattle area will be hit with 4-6 more inches of snow overnight Monday.
“Look for the snow to return tonight,” KIRO Newsradio meteorologist Ted Buehner said on The Gee &amp; Ursula Show.
“There’s enough moisture to generate a few inches in the metro Seattle area.
There will be more north of the city.”A winter storm will impact the area tonight and Tuesday, bringing widespread snow accumulation to both the lowlands and the mountain passes.
As snow turns to rain late in the week, KIRO 7 meteorologist Ilona McCauley says the chances of a White Christmas are trending downward.

     Summary: (SB 35th SW near Providence Mount St. Vincent)12:11 PM: We’ve been out all morning covering two stories outdoors (details later), but wanted to share one observation in case you’ve been trepidational about going out – our side street was snow-coated when we returned between events an hour and a half ago, and now it’s mostly clear, so there is some melting happening.
The arterials have been clear all along.
SDOT crews have been out the past few hours – here’s the map that shows you where they’ve been and when.
Meantime, the National Weather Service now has Seattle (among other areas) under a Winter Storm Watch alert starting at 7 pm tonight and lasting through Tuesday.
2:53 PM: The alert is now upgraded to a Winter Storm Warning – up to 8 inches of snow possible, but it may not last long, as the alert also mentions a possible transition to rain “across King County.”
