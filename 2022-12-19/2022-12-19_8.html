That's perfectly ordinary for the typical quarterback, but not the Green Bay Packers star.
Rodgers threw a career-high 13 picks when replacing Brett Favre in 2008.
Rodgers is now one of 10 quarterbacks with double-digit picks this season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa · 2 min readFor Green Bay Packers superstar Aaron Rodgers, there is no question who are the best quarterbacks in NFL history.
Rodgers immediately mentioned Tampa Bay Buccaneers signal-caller Tom Brady before naming NFL icons Joe Montana, Steve Young and Brett Favre.
While Aaron Rodgers has been often outshined by Tom Brady in the past, it is clear he has nothing but respect for the living legend.
Furthermore, there is no doubt that the Packers QB has huge admiration for Brett Favre, who was Green Bay’s QB before he arrived and took over the franchise.
Joe Montana is an obvious pick of course, though some would probably wonder why he put Steve Young so high on his list.

1 seed after Jalen Hurts injury by Scott RogustIn a scintillating interview with NBA star Serge Ibaka, Aaron Rodgers admits he is the greater Green Bay Packers quarterback between him and Brett Favre.
“Who’s the greatest Packers quarterback of all time: you or Brett Favre?” Ibaka asked.
Serge Ibaka got Aaron Rodgers to admit he’s the greatest Packers QB in recent historyAlthough Rodgers admitted that he’s surpassed his predecessor, he still honors Favre by including him among his top four NFL quarterbacks of all time.
Rodgers agrees Bart Starr was a Packers legend, but when it comes to the past 30 years in Green Bay, Rodgers accepts that he owns that title.

     Summary: Taylor Rapp always seems to find the football despite not being known as a ballhawk.
For the second straight week, he came down with an interception, this time against Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.
During the first quarter on Monday night, Rapp roamed toward the sideline to easily pick off an errant throw by Rodgers, who sailed the pass way over Allen Lazard’s head despite the receiver being wide open.
Rapp also had the game-sealing interception against the Raiders in Week 14, making this his second pick of the season.
He also had four in 2021 and now has nine in his career.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aaron Rodgers took a hard pass on crickets as a snack, but he did try the beer cheese soup ... with goat brains.
Ibaka, who is also a chef, whipped up a pot of hearty beer cheese soup, a classic Wisconsin comfort food, and then put a special Rodgers spin on it by adding goat brains.
Goat because he considers Rodgers the GOAT (Greatest of All Time), and brains because “the quarterback is the brain of the team,” Ibaka said.
Thoughtful planning in the kitchen aside, it wasn’t an easy sell to get Rodgers to pick up his soup spoon.
