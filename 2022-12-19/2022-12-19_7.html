     Can the Eagles count on Gardner Minshew to maintain their top NFC standing?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If Hurts is ruled out for Week 16, here's what it means for Minshew and the Eagles.
How worried are the Eagles about Hurts missing time?
Fortunately, there are no alarm bells ringing inside the Eagles' NovaCare Complex about Hurts' long-term availability.
The Eagles have plenty of wiggle room, needing just one win over their remaining three regular season games to secure the top seed in the NFC.
As Jalen Hurts deals with a right shoulder sprain, all signs are pointing to Eagles backup quarterback Gardner Minshew getting the start in Week 15 against the Dallas Cowboys.

     Jalen Hurts injury: Gardner Minshew worth adding in Fantasy Football; A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith still starters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you were the person who took a chance on Jalen Hurts in your Fantasy Football drafts, there's a pretty good chance you've still got a lot to play for heading into Week 16.
1 seed against the Cowboys in Week 16.
Brown and DeVonta Smith – and potentially Dallas Goedert, who hopes to be back from IR in Week 16 – catching his passes, Minshew should be decent enough to matter for Fantasy.
Brown is still a top-12 WR for me this week, while Smith remains a top-20 option despite the tough matchup.
He's by far the best option available in the majority of CBS Fantasy leagues, and could end up being a very good starting option down the stretch.

     How will Jalen Hurts’ injury impact the Eagles with playoffs approaching?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Our Philadelphia Eagles writers Zach Berman and Bo Wulf react to the news of Jalen Hurts’ shoulder injury.
Berman: Bo, what’s an Eagles Super Bowl run without news about an injury to the quarterback?
What’s your reaction to the news of Hurts’ injury?
Hurts could suffer an injury in the pocket or on quarterback sneaks, so it’s not as if Philadelphia was inviting injury by playing this way.
This Hurts injury is a tough blow and will add drama to a stretch of the season that might have otherwise been devoid of it.

     Summary: This report sure makes it seem like a foregone conclusion that Hurts won’t play this week at the very least.
It’s also worth noting the sprain is on Hurts’ throwing shoulder, so there will be some pain management he’ll have to deal with.
I’m told the injury is to Jalen Hurts’ right throwing shoulder.
1 seed in the NFC behind an impressive season from their offense, specifically quarterback Jalen Hurts.
