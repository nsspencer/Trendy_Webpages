Rodgers then named the other four: Hall of Famers Joe Montana, Steve Young, Brett Favre and Tampa Bay Buccaneers signal-caller Tom Brady.
Rodgers also revealed he would pick Brady as the greatest ever because of his seven championship rings.

     Aaron Rodgers gets 100% real on his Top 5 quarterbacks of all time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa ¬∑ 2 min readFor Green Bay Packers superstar Aaron Rodgers, there is no question who are the best quarterbacks in NFL history.
Rodgers immediately mentioned Tampa Bay Buccaneers signal-caller Tom Brady before naming NFL icons Joe Montana, Steve Young and Brett Favre.
While Aaron Rodgers has been often outshined by Tom Brady in the past, it is clear he has nothing but respect for the living legend.
Furthermore, there is no doubt that the Packers QB has huge admiration for Brett Favre, who was Green Bay‚Äôs QB before he arrived and took over the franchise.
Joe Montana is an obvious pick of course, though some would probably wonder why he put Steve Young so high on his list.

Watson either missed the signal or didn‚Äôt know what it meant, because Rodgers threw a pass that went incomplete as Watson ran forward had no idea the ball was coming.

     Summary: Aaron Rodgers took a hard pass on crickets as a snack, but he did try the beer cheese soup ... with goat brains.
Ibaka, who is also a chef, whipped up a pot of hearty beer cheese soup, a classic Wisconsin comfort food, and then put a special Rodgers spin on it by adding goat brains.
Goat because he considers Rodgers the GOAT (Greatest of All Time), and brains because ‚Äúthe quarterback is the brain of the team,‚Äù Ibaka said.
Thoughtful planning in the kitchen aside, it wasn‚Äôt an easy sell to get Rodgers to pick up his soup spoon.

     Summary: Taylor Rapp always seems to find the football despite not being known as a ballhawk.
For the second straight week, he came down with an interception, this time against Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.
During the first quarter on Monday night, Rapp roamed toward the sideline to easily pick off an errant throw by Rodgers, who sailed the pass way over Allen Lazard‚Äôs head despite the receiver being wide open.
Rapp also had the game-sealing interception against the Raiders in Week 14, making this his second pick of the season.
He also had four in 2021 and now has nine in his career.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the greatest Packers quarterback of all time: you or Brett Favre?‚Äù Ibaka asked.
Serge Ibaka got Aaron Rodgers to admit he‚Äôs the greatest Packers QB in recent historyAlthough Rodgers admitted that he‚Äôs surpassed his predecessor, he still honors Favre by including him among his top four NFL quarterbacks of all time.
Rodgers agrees Bart Starr was a Packers legend, but when it comes to the past 30 years in Green Bay, Rodgers accepts that he owns that title.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It seems a lot of people are going to be cursing Christian Watson's name Monday night, and one of them is Aaron Rodgers... in jest.
But a snafu by the Packers near the goal line kept it from being at least 30-12 as a final score.
The Packers lined up with two receivers bunched, and Rodgers threw a ball at the ankles of Watson due to a miscommunication.
After the game, a happy but miffed Rodgers had a simple message for Watson to Lisa Salters: "You wanna catch touchdowns, you run the right routes."
