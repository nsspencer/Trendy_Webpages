     Finland's presence in Afghanistan motivated by relations with U.S.: researchers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, FIIA's research suggests that "Finland's activities in Afghanistan were motivated by multiple objectives that were partly unclear and at times conflicting."
Between 2001 and 2021, Finland stationed around 2,500 soldiers and 140 civilian crisis management experts in Afghanistan.
"It is ... difficult to appraise in retrospect how the different forms of participation deepened Finland's relations with the U.S., for example, and whether Finland's activities were cost-efficient in terms of its partnership goals and national capacities because no expectations had been explicitly stated," Mustasilta said.
Commenting on the report, Finnish national radio Yle noted that comparable surveys in Norway and Sweden had given similar results.
The FIIA report was based on 64 interviews with key Finnish decision makers and their colleagues.
