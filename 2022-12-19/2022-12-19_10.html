    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pope Francis has already written his resignation letter in case he experiences sudden ill health or incapacitation due any reason.
"I have already signed my renunciation," Francis told the outlet.
Pope Francis reportedly gave the letter to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone in 2013.
Though Bertone has since stepped down as Cardinal Secretary of State, Pope Francis believes the message is in good hands with his successor, Cardinal Pietro Parolin.
Should Francis resign, he would follow a precedent set by Pope Benedict XVI, making him only the second pope to do so in 600-plus years.
