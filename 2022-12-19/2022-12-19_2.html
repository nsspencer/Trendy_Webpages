     Donald Trump: how will prosecutors pursue the House panel’s charges?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House January 6 select committee outlined criminal referrals against Donald Trump for charges that experts believe the justice department could definitely pursue should it move forward with prosecuting the former US president over his efforts to stop the congressional certification of the 2020 election.
The criminal referrals are largely symbolic since Congress has no ability to compel the justice department to seek charges, and federal prosecutors for months have been running their own parallel investigation into the Capitol attack and Trump’s efforts to overturn his defeat.
The fourth referral for incitement of insurrection would be the most unlikely charge for the department to pursue, the legal experts said, even though the statute requires prosecutors to show merely that Trump assisted lawless activity connected to 6 January.
At issue is the fact that Trump would almost certainly argue that both his now-infamous tweet urging supporters to protest at the Capitol – “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump wrote.
“Be there, will be wild!” – and his speech at the Ellipse rally could be protected first amendment activity.

     U.S. House Jan. 6 panel refers Trump for criminal charges, including inciting insurrection – Oregon Capital Chronicle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in a historic vote agreed unanimously Monday to refer former President Donald Trump and others to the Justice Department for potential criminal charges, including inciting or aiding an insurrection.
Committee members said that video came after more than three hours of inaction as Trump watched the attack.
Trump then sat in the White House dining room and watched as the attack unfolded, members of the panel said.
His actions violated a core principle of U.S. government, the two-century tradition of a peaceful transition of power, committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said.
Ethics Committee referralThe panel also referred Biggs, Jordan, Perry and McCarthy to their chamber’s ethics panel.

     Jan. 6 Committee Makes Trump Prosecution Imperative

     Summary: And the Justice Department would do well to bring the full weight of the law to bear on Trump and his merry band of co-conspirators and thugs.
No Trump, no Jan. 6 insurrection.
The Justice Department has also charged about 900 people with crimes linked to the Jan. 6 insurrection.
And the Jan. 6 committee has, quite appropriately, made him the centerpiece of any legal examination and repercussions related to the insurrection.
Its work has made it impossible for the Justice Department, voters and Trump’s party to overlook him.

     The House Jan. 6 committee’s criminal referrals don’t guarantee Trump will see his day in court
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Criminal charges should be brought against former president Donald Trump over the Capitol Hill riots of Jan. 6, 2021, according to a bipartisan House committee that spent 17 months investigating the event.
The panel, set up in July 2021, will dissolve on Jan. 3, and the new Republican-led House is unlikely to revive it.
Yet, House Jan. 6 committee head Bennie Thompson is confident the justice department will probe and charge Trump.
A professor at Chapman University at the time, Eastman spoke during Trump’s rally at the White House Ellipse ahead of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol.
For years, Trump has guarded his tax returns from the public view—but that could change soon.

     House Ways and Means Committee to meet on future of Trump’s tax returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal requested the first six years of Trump’s taxes as well as tax returns for eight of his businesses back in April of 2019.
Republicans on the committee are preparing to push back hard if Democrats vote to release any of Trump’s tax information, committee sources tell CNN.
Historical precedentWhen Neal requested Trump’s tax information in 2019, he wasn’t the first chairman to use an arcane section of the tax code known as 6013 to glean confidential tax information.
According to the House Ways and Means Committee, that information was requested and received without a legal fight.
Neal also requested administrative files and paperwork, items that could include IRS officials’ notes or audits of Trump’s returns.

     Summary: Senate Republicans are stepping out of the way of the House Jan. 6 committee’s recommendation that the Justice Department prosecute former President Trump for crimes related to the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
“The entire nation knows who is responsible for that day,” McConnell said in a statement, pointing the finger squarely at Trump in response to the House Jan. 6 committee referring four criminal charges against Trump to the Justice Department.
House Republicans are expected to dismantle the Jan. 6 panel after they take control of the chamber in January.
Many Senate Republicans, however, voted that way on technical grounds because Trump at the time of the trial was no longer in office.
Asked about McConnell’s statement that the entire nation knows Trump is responsible for the Jan. 6 attack, Murkowski replied, “I agree.

     Summary: | Carolyn Kaster/AP PhotoGovernment ethics and finance experts say the timing and the similarity of the two transactions suggest that BH Fund, too, may have been involved in the purchase of Conway’s firm.
The ties between BH Fund and CRC are substantial.
The other BH Fund director listed in their corporate filings, Jonathan Bunch, also joined CRC around the same time as president.
Ethics specialists pointed to the possible involvement of BH Fund as a key question looming over the sale.
BH Fund is a group Leo has used to direct millions of dollars to organizations boosting the nominations of Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett.
