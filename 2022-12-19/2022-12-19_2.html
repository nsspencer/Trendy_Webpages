     Rams vs. Packers inactives: Who is not playing in Week 15
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rams are coming off a come-from-behind win in Week 14, can they pull off another underdog victory?
We don’t have the official inactives report yet as it is released an hour and a half before kickoff, but we know which players are definitely not playing.
The Rams have ruled out DT Marquise Copeland (ankle), DT Aaron Donald (ankle), LB Travin Howard (hip), CB David Long (groin) and QB John Wolford (neck).
For the first time in a while, the Packers have a pretty light injury report.
Starting running back Aaron Jones was limited all week with an ankle injury but doesn’t have an injury designation for Monday.
