     Utah Jazz Fans Should Brace for Donovan Mitchell's Revenge Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What's in store for the Utah Jazz as they face off against Donovan Mitchell for the first time?
The media will posture Monday night's contest between the Utah Jazz and Cleveland Cavaliers as a regular season game.
The reality is, Donovan Mitchell will view this opportunity as fuel for revenge against Jazz executive Danny Ainge and the Jazz organization, who purportedly traded him against his will.
Based on reporting at the time, Mitchell remained consistent with his views that he did not want the Jazz to trade him.
Although former Jazz great Rudy Gobert was dealt to the Minnesota Timberwolves prior to the Mitchell trade to Cleveland, I wrote that the O'Neale trade was the beginning of the end for Mitchell's reign in a Jazz uniform.

Whatever the cause — maybe fatigue, maybe just some off nights, maybe a mix of both — his shot has just been off, falling just short.

Coming out of the second half, the Jazz came out with energy, had a 5-0 run and punched the Cavs back.
This is what a Cavs team playing with energy can look like.

     Jazz Guard Talen Horton-Tucker Hits Circus Shot Against Cavaliers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SALT LAKE CITY – Jazz guard Talen Horton-Tucker scored on a layup while nearly doing the splits during Utah’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.
The Cavaliers hosted the Jazz at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse on Monday, December 19.
Despite nearly falling into the splits, Horton-Tucker had an open look at the bucket and shot the ball.
Utah’s game against Cleveland marks the Jazz’s first meeting with Mitchell since the superstar guard was traded in September.
The three former Cavaliers were traded to the Jazz in September as part of a trade centered on three-time NBA All-Star Donovan Mitchell.

     Summary: The Cavs shot the air out of the ball, torched the Jazz in transition and outplayed the Jazz on both ends of the floor.
Kelly Olynyk’s importanceA lot of people did not view the Jazz’s trade for Kelly Olynyk as a good one.
But, I do think that Olynyk is more important to the Jazz than people might be willing to admit.
He knows the game really well and he’s smart about where to put his body and how to force players into making tough decisions.
“Kelly is a big part of our team,” Hardy said.

     Summary: Donovan Mitchell led the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday to a 122-99 win over the Utah Jazz team that traded him this offseason.
"If I’m being honest with you, I never really said this, but it was draining," Mitchell told Spears.
He also referenced Utah state senator Stuart Adams, who suggested that Mitchell needed to be educated after Mitchell spoke out against a critical race theory resolution in the state legislature.
Dec 19, 2022; Cleveland, Ohio, USA; Utah Jazz guard Jordan Clarkson (00) defends Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell (45) in the first quarter at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.
"I’m going to give him a hug and be happy to see him," Mitchell told Spears of Gobert.
