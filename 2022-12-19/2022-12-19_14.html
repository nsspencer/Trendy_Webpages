    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even more impressive than Ackie portraying Whitney as she experienced her career highs, was the embodiment of her personal struggles with fame, vices, and turbulent relationship with Bobby Brown, played by Ashton Sanders.
Reporter Aurora Fowlkes caught up with the rising star, Ackie, on the carpet last Tuesday night at the AMC Lincoln Square in Manhattan for the world premiere of ‘I Wanna Dance With Somebody’, as she touched on the challenges of becoming Whitney Houston on screen.
Equally, appreciative of working with the amazing cast behind ‘I Wanna Dance With Somebody’ is film, stage, and television actress, director, and producer, Tamara Tunie who plays the role of Whitney’s mother, Cissy Houston.
Mentioning that stepping onto the carpet for the film’s premiere felt “exhilarating”, Tunie also recalled feeling a “sigh of relief.”‘I Wanna Dance With Somebody’ began its principal photography in August 2021, in Newark, New Jersey during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Letting out an exhale Tunie states, “we wrapped this movie a year ago, and we’ve been waiting for this day.
