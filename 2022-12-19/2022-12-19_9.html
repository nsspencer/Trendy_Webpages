     Afghanistan begins last phase of polio vaccination
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kabul, Dec 19 (EFE).- The Taliban began the last phase of its polio vaccination campaign in Afghanistan on Monday, seeking to immunize nearly seven million children, concluding a year in which only two cases of the virus were recorded across the country.
“The ministry of public health of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan – as the Taliban call themselves – in cooperation with relevant international agencies today launched the last round of polio vaccination campaign this year,” the ministry spokesperson Sharafat Zaman Amar told EFE.
Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan are the only countries in the world where polio is endemic.
In this regard, the authorities called on the families of the minors to collaborate with the vaccination teams in help erradicate the disease from the country.
Polio vaccination teams have often been subject to attacks, including one in February this year in which eight workers were killed in northern Afghanistan, leading to the United Nations office in the country to stop vaccination in two provinces with immediate effect.

     Finland's presence in Afghanistan motivated by relations with U.S.: researchers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, FIIA's research suggests that "Finland's activities in Afghanistan were motivated by multiple objectives that were partly unclear and at times conflicting."
Between 2001 and 2021, Finland stationed around 2,500 soldiers and 140 civilian crisis management experts in Afghanistan.
"It is ... difficult to appraise in retrospect how the different forms of participation deepened Finland's relations with the U.S., for example, and whether Finland's activities were cost-efficient in terms of its partnership goals and national capacities because no expectations had been explicitly stated," Mustasilta said.
Commenting on the report, Finnish national radio Yle noted that comparable surveys in Norway and Sweden had given similar results.
The FIIA report was based on 64 interviews with key Finnish decision makers and their colleagues.

     Afghanistan Launches Polio Vaccination Campaign Amid Persistent Doubts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Instead of taking to the streets, people have been chanting anti-government slogans from their apartment buildings in several neighborhoods of Tehran, according to posts on social media.
At the same time, street protests and slogans continued in some neighborhoods of the northeastern Iranian city of Mashhad and the western city of Kermanshah.
However, some social media posts described the prison conflict as severe and reported the presence of firefighters, ambulances, and plainclothes forces.
Earlier, there were reports of a riot at the Karaj Central Prison where many protesters arrested in the recent unrest are being held.
Judicial authorities have yet to publish accurate information on the number of people injured and killed in the riots.
