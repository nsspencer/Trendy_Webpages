     Utah Jazz Fans Should Brace for Donovan Mitchell's Revenge Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What's in store for the Utah Jazz as they face off against Donovan Mitchell for the first time?
The media will posture Monday night's contest between the Utah Jazz and Cleveland Cavaliers as a regular season game.
The reality is, Donovan Mitchell will view this opportunity as fuel for revenge against Jazz executive Danny Ainge and the Jazz organization, who purportedly traded him against his will.
Based on reporting at the time, Mitchell remained consistent with his views that he did not want the Jazz to trade him.
Although former Jazz great Rudy Gobert was dealt to the Minnesota Timberwolves prior to the Mitchell trade to Cleveland, I wrote that the O'Neale trade was the beginning of the end for Mitchell's reign in a Jazz uniform.
