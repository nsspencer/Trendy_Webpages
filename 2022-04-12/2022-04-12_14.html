But Bitgert has also been overtaking some of the largest cryptocurrencies in the market, and Shiba Inu is one of them.
Despite being #15 on the list of the largest cryptocurrencies in the market, Shiba Inu is being overtaken by the unstoppable Bitgert.
Bitgert is overtaking Shiba Inu and many other cryptocurrencies because of its impressive development and growth.
The lack of products has left Shiba Inu with nothing to hold on to after the meme coin started dying.

     Shiba Inu is among four crypto tokens listed on Robinhood
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Robinhood Markets Inc. included four new cryptocurrencies on its platform, including the Shiba Inu coin, in a win for proponents who had long argued in favor of the joke token becoming available for trading.
“As a safety-first company, we have a rigorous framework in place to help us evaluate assets for listing, and we remain committed to providing a safe and educational crypto platform."
Robinhood users have long requested the brokerage allow SHIB, as the Shiba coin is known, to be traded -- a Change.org petition started last year has seen more than 550,000 signatories in favor of the move.
The wallet enables users to interact with crypto outside of Robinhood’s trading platform, including allowing them to buy non-fungible tokens, Bloomberg reported.
The product was first announced in September, not long after Robinhood Chief Executive Vlad Tenev said that such a wallet was in high demand among customers.

"If creators are selling their videos as NFTs, then that's an important form of monetization.
“At the end of the day what YouTube does is, we’re a platform that distributes content and monetization,” she said.
“I don’t think [Shorts funds are] permanent,” Wojcicki said.
“YouTube has a great monetization program for long-form creators, and we want to extend that for Shorts,” Wojcicki said.
