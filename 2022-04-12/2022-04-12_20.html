     Millie Bobby Brown Calls Out Press for Sexualizing Her More After Turning 18: ‘It’s Gross’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Stranger Things” and “Enola Holmes” actor Millie Bobby Brown appeared on the “Guilty Feminist” podcast this week (via the Los Angeles Times) and openly discussed how the press and social media users have sexualized her throughout her career.
Brown was just 12 years old when “Stranger Things” debuted.
The actor turned 18 this past February and noted that she’s already noticed a difference in how much more she’s now being sexualized in the media.
“Any 18-year-old is dealing with navigating being an adult and having relationships and friendships and being liked and trying to fit in,” Brown said.
Brown and the streaming giant will reunite again for the original movie “Damsel,” which the actor is also executive producing.

     Millie Bobby Brown Has Had Enough of Your Creepy Posts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Karwai Tang/WireImageMillie Bobby Brown may be a legal adult, but that doesn’t mean she’s willing to be sexualized by fans or Hollywood.
Brown’s been in the public eye for six years, and she’s seen enough to recognize a change in how she’s being discussed in the press and on social media.
But, then I see a subreddit was created just before Brown’s birthday reportedly called “This subreddit will open when Millie turns 18, which is February 19, 2022.” Gross!
(The subreddit was reportedly taken down.)
Let’s stop this nonsense and let Brown and her boyfriend, Jacob Bongiovi, in peace.
