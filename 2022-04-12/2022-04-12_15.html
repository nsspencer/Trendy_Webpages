Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday announced the apparent capture of Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Kremlin politician who was living in Ukraine.
Medvedchuk had been under house arrest on treason charges since last year, but allegedly escaped shortly after Russia launched its invasion in late February.
Above that caption, Zelenskyy posted a photo showing a disheveled Medvedchuk seated by a radiator with his hands clasped in handcuffs.
Ukraine's Security Service posted a mugshot of Medvedchuk on its official Twitter account, along with a cavalier warning for other Russia-allied Ukrainians.

     Ukraine announces capture of top Putin pal Viktor Medvedchuk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukrainian forces say they’ve captured Russian President Vladimir Putin’s close ally Viktor Medvedchuk, who was facing treason charges and escaped house arrest in Ukraine in the early days of the war.
He escaped house arrest after Putin declared war on Ukraine on February 24, and has been in hiding since.
In a photo published by the SBU, Medvedchuk is seen wearing a Ukrainian army uniform and appears disheveled and pale.
In his nightly address on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed Medvedchuk had been captured, saying he had been found attempting to disguise himself as a soldier.
In March this year, after the Russian invasion, Zelenskyy suspended Medvedchuk’s party, along with several others that have ties to Russia.

     Who is Viktor Medvedchuk, Putin’s main man in Ukraine?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On February 28 this year, four days after Russia invaded Ukraine, Medvedchuk fled his house arrest.
But Ukrainian forces thwarted Putin’s blitzkrieg – and intelligence service kept looking for Medvedchuk, whose pro-Russia political party, Eurosceptic Opposition Platform – For Life, suspended operations a month after his escape.
Medvedchuk’s transformation from Putin’s right-hand man into a fugitive became a perfect counterpoint of Ukraine’s political and ideological metamorphosis.
He failed to be re-elected as a lawmaker, and his political party polled dismally.
He remained Putin’s main man and regained influence after Yanukovych was overthrown in 2014 by Ukraine’s second pro-Western revolt, known as the Revolution of Dignity.

     Kremlin dismisses Ukraine’s offer to free Putin ally in prisoner exchange
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kremlin has turned down Ukraine’s offer of a prisoner exchange for Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Ukraine, the oligarch and opposition politician Viktor Medvedchuk, arrested on Tuesday in what was described as a “lightning-fast and dangerous” operation.
The Kremlin shrugged off the exchange offer, and warned Ukrainian leaders to “watch out”, threatening them with abduction in response.
Zelenskiy also suspended Medvedchuk’s party – Ukraine’s largest opposition grouping – and several other smaller political parties tied to Moscow in March.
Medvedchuk’s arrest and indictment angered Putin who threatened to respond to what he deemed to be political persecution.
Kyiv’s crackdown on Medvedchuk had sparked anger in the Kremlin, with Putin vowing at one stage to “respond” to what he called a political persecution.
