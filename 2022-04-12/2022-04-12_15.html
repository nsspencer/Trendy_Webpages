     Putin vows to press invasion until Russia's goals are met
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “And then we’ll use chemical troops to smoke them out of there,” the official, Eduard Basurin, said.
Much of the city has been razed in weeks of pummeling by Russian troops.
Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, acknowledged the challenges Ukrainian troops face in Mariupol.
Deliberately firing them into an enclosed space to expose people to fumes could breach the Chemical Weapons Convention, said Marc-Michael Blum, a former laboratory head at the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
In the face of stiff resistance by Ukrainian forces bolstered by Western weapons, Russian forces have increasingly relied on bombarding cities, flattening many urban areas and leaving thousands of people dead.

     Putin says peace talks at 'dead end,' US 'deeply' concerned about chemical weapons: Live Ukraine updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia's audacious invasion of Ukraine is proceeding as planned and peace talks have reached a "dead end," Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday.
Putin, speaking at a joint press conference with ally Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, accused Ukraine of violating agreements made during talks in Istanbul.
The focus of the Russian invasion, which began Feb. 24, has moved into eastern and southern Ukraine, the official said.
He also said that by invading Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin “precipitated everything he sought to prevent” as Ukraine's interest in joining NATO has only grown.
The U.S. closed its embassy in Kyiv in mid-February as the Russian invasion appeared imminent.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: @V_Zelenskiy_official via Telegram A leading pro-Russian politician in Ukraine was shown in fatigues and handcuffs in a photo Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted Tuesday on Telegram.
He was considered one of the closest Ukrainian politicians to Russia President Vladimir Putin and became a state treason suspect in 2021 in an alleged coal-buying scheme.
NBC's Al Roker asked the former president if the Russian president is the same Putin he dealt with during his two terms in the White House.
Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of blocking attempted humanitarian convoys and hampering efforts to evacuate residents.
It said Russian forces have continued to withdraw from Belarus as they look to redeploy to support operations in eastern Ukraine.
