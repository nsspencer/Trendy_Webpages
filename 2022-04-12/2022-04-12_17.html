     Millie Bobby Brown Spoke Out About The ‘Gross’ Way She’s Treated Now That She’s 18
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since turning 18 in February, Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown has noticed a change in the way she’s treated on social media, and it’s not a good one.
“Being liked and trying to fit in, it’s all a lot, and you’re trying to find yourself while doing that.
“I think it’s just a very good representation of what’s going on in the world and how young girls are sexualized.
I’ll continue doing what I love and spreading the message in order to make change.”Sadly, Millie Bobby Brown is far from the first young star to deal with this phenomenon.
Some British tabloids published a countdown to Emma Watson’s 18th birthday in 2008, and once she was legal, took horrifying upskirt shots of her.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: English actor Millie Bobby Brown has noticed a shift in the way people and the media have treated her since she turned 18 in February.
On Monday’s episode of the “Guilty Feminist” podcast, the “Stranger Things” star opened up about being sexualized as a child celebrity and the “overwhelming” experience of growing up in the entertainment industry.
The only difference is that, obviously, I’m doing that in the public eye, so it can be really overwhelming.”AdvertisementWhen “Stranger Things” premiered on Netflix in July 2016, Brown was 12 years old.
Six years and nearly three seasons of “Stranger Things” later, Brown is still processing her fame as she enters the next chapter of her life.
“The young women on [Disney Channel] were so heavily sexualized from such an earlier age than my brother [Dylan] and I that there’s absolutely no way that we could compare our experiences,” Sprouse said.

     Summary: “Stranger Things” and “Enola Holmes” actor Millie Bobby Brown appeared on the “Guilty Feminist” podcast this week (via the Los Angeles Times) and openly discussed how the press and social media users have sexualized her throughout her career.
Brown was just 12 years old when “Stranger Things” debuted.
The actor turned 18 this past February and noted that she’s already noticed a difference in how much more she’s now being sexualized in the media.
“Any 18-year-old is dealing with navigating being an adult and having relationships and friendships and being liked and trying to fit in,” Brown said.
