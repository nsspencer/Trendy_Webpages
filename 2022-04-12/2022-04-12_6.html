     Lt. Gov. Benjamin Resigns Following Campaign Finance Indictment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier in the day, Mr. Benjamin pleaded not guilty at a brief appearance in Federal District Court in Lower Manhattan, and was released on $250,000 bond under terms that would require him to get special permission to travel to Albany.
Lawyers for Mr. Benjamin, James D. Gatta and William J. Harrington, also initially declined to comment.
Mr. Benjamin said last week that he had been cooperating with investigators, after news outlets, including The New York Times, reported details of the investigation.
Prosecutors said that Mr. Benjamin first approached Mr. Migdol for help in March 2019, months before he announced a campaign for comptroller.
“Let me see what I can do,” Mr. Benjamin replied, according to the indictment.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brian Benjamin resigned Tuesday after he was arrested on charges related to a campaign finance fraud investigation, officials said.
His arrest followed reports that Manhattan federal prosecutors and the FBI were investigating whether Benjamin knowingly engaged in a campaign finance fraud scheme.
An indictment alleges that Benjamin was given campaign contributions from a Harlem real estate developer.
"By doing so, Benjamin abused his power and effectively used state funds to support his political campaigns."
Migdol is charged with wire fraud in connection with an alleged campaign fraud scheme linked to past Benjamin fundraising.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brian Benjamin surrendered to authorities Tuesday on federal bribery charges related to a scheme to funnel illegal contributions to his campaign for the office of New York City Comptroller in 2021.
Last fall, federal officials subpoenaed Benjamin’s former campaign advisers for financial records and communications between Migdol and the campaign.
He could not yet contribute directly to Benjamin's comptroller campaign because Benjamin had yet to certify his run for comptroller with the New York City Campaign Finance Board.
"Taxpayer money for campaign contributions - quid pro quo," Williams, the U.S. Attorney, said Tuesday.

     New York Lieutenant Governor Brian Benjamin Charged With Bribery And Related Offenses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He allegedly allocated public grant funds to a non-profit controlled by a co-conspirator in exchange for campaign contributions, and then lied to hide this illegal scheme.
CC-1 provided BENJAMIN with three checks totaling $25,000 made out to BENJAMIN’s New York State senate campaign (the “Senate Campaign”).
Because BENJAMIN had not yet filed a certification regarding his Comptroller Campaign with the New York City Campaign Finance Board (“CFB”), BENJAMIN could accept campaign contributions only to his senate campaign.
As a state campaign, the senate campaign was not eligible for public matching funds available in New York City municipal races.
Between October 2019 and January 2021, CC-1 obtained numerous contributions for BENJAMIN’s Comptroller Campaign, many of which were fraudulent (the “CC-1 Contributions”).

     Summary: Brian Benjamin speaks during the 2022 New York State Democratic Convention at the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel on February 17, 2022 in New York City.
Brian Benjamin has resigned after being arrested and indicted on charges in connection with his alleged participation in a scheme to obtain campaign contributions in exchange for securing a state grant, according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday.
Damian Williams, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, condemned Benjamin at a news conference early Tuesday afternoon.
“This is a simple story of corruption,” Williams said, adding later, “Taxpayer money for campaign contributions.
A Benjamin campaign spokesperson previously told CNN, “Neither Lieutenant Governor Benjamin nor his campaign are being accused of any wrongdoing and they are prepared to fully cooperate with authorities.
