     Stranger Things 4’s new trailer teases a guitar battle in the Upside Down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even though we’ve seen a few teasers of Stranger Things’ upcoming fourth season, none of them really let on just how much larger and epic in scope this next chapter seems like it’s going to be.
While Stranger Things has explored the larger world outside of Hawkins, Indiana, in the past, the show’s fourth season is set to switch things up by splitting its story across a handful of disparate, important locations.
Though the story will presumably return to the Upside Down and catch up with Jim Hopper in Russia, Stranger Things’ first season four trailer makes clear that a significant part of its next chapter will unfold in California, where Joyce and the rest of the Byers family have moved.
1 of Stranger Things season 4 premieres on May 27th, 2022, and Vol.
2 drops on Netflix on July 1st, 2022.

     Stranger Things season 4 trailer introduces a new Upside Down enemy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stranger Things season 4 has its first real trailer.
Stranger Things season 4 is set to arrive on Netflix on May 27.
The trailer also makes it clear that this season is going for a more classic horror-movie vibe, complete with an eerie haunted house the kids will have to explore.
Stranger Things season 4 brings back just about everyone from the Stranger Things universe including David Harbour’s Jim Hopper, Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers, Maya Hawke as Robin, Joe Keery as Steve, and Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler.
In case you don’t remember what happened last time around (since the show hasn’t been around since 2019), Stranger Things season 3 once again brought the Upside Down to Hawkins.

     Summary: It’s been nearly three long years since we last saw Eleven, Mike, Lucas, Dustin, Steve, Will, Hopper, Nancy, Jonathan, Joyce, and any Stranger Things kids we’re forgetting (Maya Hawke’s character!
But this is Stranger Things, so of course, a brand new horrifying monster is lurking in the shadows.
Season four of Stranger Things will be split into two halves, with the first half premiering on Netflix on May 27.
The Duffers have teased that they’d like to do some spin-offs in the world of Stranger Things, but we probably won’t hear anything more about that until we get closer to the real finale.
Stranger Things season 4A will drop on May 27.
