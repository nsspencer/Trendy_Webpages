     Lawyer: Johnny Depp trial likely to become mudslinging soap opera
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) — A trial over libel allegations by Johnny Depp against his ex-wife, Amber Heard, will likely turn into a six-week, mudslinging soap opera, Heard’s lawyers warned a Virginia jury Tuesday.
“You’re going to see who the real Johnny Depp is — behind the fame, behind the pirate costumes,” Heard lawyer J. Benjamin Rottenborn told the jury during opening statements in the civil trial.
In Tuesday’s opening statements, Rottenborn said the evidence will show that Depp physically and sexually assaulted Heard on multiple occasions.
Another of Depp’s lawyers, Camille Vasquez, told the jury that Heard refuses to admit she lied and has now dug in even deeper.
Depp’s lawyers have said they brought the case in Virginia in part because the laws here are more favorable to their case.

     Summary: "None of what was happening in our home felt good," Johnny Depp's older sister Christi Dembrowski testified in court TuesdayJohnny Depp's sister Christi Dembrowski testified in court Tuesday about being abused by their mother Betty Sue Palmer while growing up.
"We would run and hide," she recalled of seeing her mom being abusive toward their father, who she said would not react.
Betty "softened" as she grew older, Dembrowski said.
The court upheld the outlet's claims as being "substantially true" and Heard testified to back up the claims.
