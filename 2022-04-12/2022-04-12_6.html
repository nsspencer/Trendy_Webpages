     WNBA concerned over Brittney Griner situation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 12 - WNBA officials are growing concerned for Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner, who has been held captive nearly two months in Russia and faces up to 10 years in prison.
"This is an unimaginable situation for BG to be in," WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said.
Russian media reported Griner would be detained until at least May 19, which is two weeks into the WNBA regular season.
Griner is one of approximately 70 WNBA players who use the offseason to play for an international team.
Engelbert said the Mercury and WNBA officials are in constant contact with the United States government and Griner's legal representation.

Griner has been detained in the country since February after being stopped and searched at Sheremetyevo International Airport, where officials discovered vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage.
“It’s tough,” Ogwumike said of Griner’s situation in a Tuesday interview on Good Morning America.
“Pay inequity.”The WNBPA president has played in Russia for four years, Poland for one year and China for two years, pointing out that women’s players do so to supplement their income in the States.

     Gissou Nia: Is Brittney Griner a Russian hostage?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, right now U.S. citizens are more often taken hostage by foreign governments than by nonstate actors.
Sadly, it seems that the detention of WNBA champ Brittney Griner by Russian authorities may be part of that trend.
And Griner was purportedly denied consular access — a basic right of any foreign national in detention — until March 23.
Rather, foreign states that take hostages are violating their international obligations under human rights conventions like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which many hostage-taking states, including Russia, are parties to.
Brittney Griner is in Russian detention and may be there for geopolitical gains wholly unrelated to any of her actions.
