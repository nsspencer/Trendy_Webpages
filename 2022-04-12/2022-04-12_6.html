     Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm says 'I f---ing hate this place' about Philadelphia, lives to tell the tale

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Damage control game = strong.
Again, Bohm would have been well within his rights to say "you guys are reading too far into this," but owning up to it was a much, much smarter move.
Thanks to that, and a Phillies win, the fans will forget about this entirely ... for 24 whole hours.
If Bohm makes another error or goes 0-for-4 with four strikeouts on Tuesday night, you can bet your life savings the fans will make sure he still "f---ing hates this place."
He should just keep it to himself the next time he says it, though.

     Alec Bohm apologizes to Phillies fans after lip-readers spotted him saying 'I [expletive] hate this place'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad night for Alec Bohm.
Monday ended with a win for the Philadelphia Phillies, but for the third baseman, he struggled in the field before cameras caught him saying something that went VERY viral thanks to lip-readers on Twitter.
Bohm appeared to say, “I [expletive] hate this place” after Phillies fans gave him an extremely sarcastic cheer after he made a routine play at third for an out, something he failed to do when he committed three errors against the New York Mets.
But he did apologize after the game.
Let’s break it all down:

     Phillies 3B Alec Bohm apologizes after errors, ‘I hate this place’ comment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm let his emotions get the better of him after an error-filled start to Monday night’s game against the Mets.
When his frustration level reached its peak, he made a rather pointed comment that roped in the city of Philadelphia and the team’s fanbase.
After making three errors in the first two innings of the game, Bohm finally righted the ship on a routine ground ball from New York’s Starling Marte in the top of the second.
Cameras flashed to Bohm following the play and showed him mouthing some choice words about the response from the crowd.
Bohm, 25, finished the game with three errors but drew two walks and scored an important run in the Phillies’ 5–4 win.

     Hittin’ Season #549: A huge comeback &amp; the Ballad of Alec Bohm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just another typical Phillies vs. Mets baseball game.
Last night the Phils did something they hadn’t done in a few years.
Their comeback win vs the Mets was the first of its kind since August 2019, when they trailed 5-0 to the Cubs and won 7-5 on a Bryce Harper walkoff grand slam.
Last night, Schwarber drove in the first of the Phils’ five runs with an RBI force out and scored on J.T.
But the night also saw its share of drama, as the Ballad of Alec Bohm unfolded.

     Summary: Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm said he let his emotions get the best of him when he dropped an F-bomb in Philadelphia’s 5-4 comeback win against the Mets on Monday.
After the game, Bohm apologized for being caught on camera saying, “I f–king hate this place” to Phillies teammate Didi Gregorius, apparently referring to Philadelphia.
Bohm appeared frustrated after hearing sarcastic cheers from fans at Citizens Bank Park, when he made a routine play at third at the top of the second.
Cameras captured a closeup of Bohm during the heated moment, which he was asked about after the game.
The Phillies trailed 4-0 before they scored five runs in the eighth against two Mets relievers for a stunning comeback.

     Summary: Television cameras caught Bohm looking over at shortstop Didi Gregorius and saying, "I (bleeping) hate this place."
He could have claimed he said, "I bleeping hate those plays."
The Phillies roared back for a five-run eighth inning to shock the Mets, 5-4, picking up Alec Bohm after he committed 3 errors and was caught on camera saying, "I (bleeping) hate this place.
Emotions got the best of the Phillies' dugout as the bats came alive in the bottom of the eighth inning.
He heard the crowd chanting, Didi ... Didi ... Didi ..."I felt like I had to come through," he said afterward.

Somewhere Perry Hill felt a twinge and didn’t know why.
Perry Hill tenets violated: idk, all of them?
Like Bohm, J.P. was a first-round pick by the Phillies, although 16th overall rather than third; Bohm was in much more rarefied air as a top-5 pick.
Should the Mariners entertain a push trade: the 2016 third overall pick in Bohm for the sixth overall pick in Jarred Kelenic?
