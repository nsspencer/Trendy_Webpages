     Shiba Inu, Solana Among Four Cryptocurrencies Listed on Robinhood (HOOD)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Robinhood Markets Inc. included four new cryptocurrencies on its platform, including the Shiba Inu coin, in a win for proponents who had long argued in favor of the joke token becoming available for trading.
The platform popular with daytraders also added Solana’s SOL, Polygon’s Matic and Compound’s COMP to its list of available trades in a possible appeal to users now that the surge in retail trading that came during the outbreak of the pandemic lockdowns has abated.
Prices of all the tokens listed rose.
Shares of Robinhood were up 4.6% as of 9:33 a.m. in New York.

     Shiba Inu (SHIB) Finally Listed by Robinhood Together with Other Altcoins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meme cryptocurrency Shiba Inu appears to have been listed by commission-free investing app Robinhood, according to a listing bot.
Image by tradingview.comShiba Inu has been listed alongside Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC) and Compound (COMP), bringing the total number of available cryptocurrencies to 11.
Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev and other high-profile executives have repeatedly dodged the burning question about whether or not Shiba Inu should be listed on the platform, fueling speculation within the community.
Robinhood launched support for crypto trading in early 2018, originally adding support for Bitcoin and Ethereum.
The commission-free trading app boasts 17.3 million active users after becoming the go-to trading app choice for young millennials.

     Robinhood appears to be adding four cryptos including Shiba Inu and Solana
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: These are the memecoin Shiba Inu, blockchains Solana and Polygon, and DeFi lending protocol Compound.
Robinhood added Dogecoin early on, as it shot up with the backing of Elon Musk — making up 62% of its quarterly crypto revenue in Q2 2021.
Coinbase, which only added Dogecoin in June 2021, was much faster quicker to the draw for Shiba Inu.
It added Shiba in September 2021, only a few months after it had started gaining traction.
Shiba was similarly themed around the Shiba Inu breed of dog, but with a much higher total supply of tokens.

However, each of these tokens has struggled in 2022, with SHIB in the lead by only losing 17% on the year.
Each of these tokens has had a rough start to 2022 TradingViewEver since Robinhood began offering crypto trading in 2018, customers had been clamoring for the opportunity to buy and sell more tokens.
However, the company avoided listing SHIB until now because of fears about its outsize volatility, even for crypto.
