     The drama and Ben Simmons questions awaiting Nets now that they’re finally in the playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sign up here to get Beyond the Back Page delivered to your inbox each weekday morning.
Ben Simmons donned a green suit jacket with matching shorts as he watched from the bench Tuesday night.
The Nets will be seeing that color — and perhaps their prized midseason acquisition – in the first round of the playoffs.
Whether Simmons gets on the court or not, the Nets hardly resemble a traditional No.
They became the first Nets teammates to record at least 20 points and 10 assists apiece in a game since 1993.

     Scrambling in Play-In, Nets Offer Glimpse of What They Can Be
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Andre Drummond punished Cleveland on the boards, scoring 16 points and grabbing 8 rebounds in only 19 minutes.
Nic Claxton, the spry reserve center, added 13 points, 9 rebounds and 5 blocks off the bench.
But the glass-half-empty set had evidence, too, after the Nets nearly blew yet another lead down the stretch against a lesser team.
In the game before that — also against Cleveland — the Nets blew a double-digit, third-quarter lead.
Before that was a game against the Knicks, another less talented team playing out the string; the Nets trailed by 21 points in the first half that time.

     Summary: His teammate, guard Bruce Brown, had already been by the podium just minutes earlier.
"What did Bruce Brown say when he got up here?"
So them not having Robert Williams is huge."
When told of his teammates comments just minutes earlier, Durant was noticeably irked by them.
Game 1 of the Nets series against the Celtics starts Saturday at 3:30 p.m."We respect our opponents," Durant said.

     Charles Barkley: ‘No way’ Nets can beat Celtics in first round series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Celtics may have opened their series as betting underdogs against the Brooklyn Nets but one star NBA analyst thinks the No.
Charles Barkley weighed in on the matchup on Inside the NBA Tuesday night after the Nets beat the Cavs to earn the No 7 seed.
“There’s no way they can beat the Celtics,” Barkley said.
But other than that, I know they can’t beat the Celtics now.
“I mean, we can’t let Tatum get 50,” Nets guard Bruce Brown said after beating the Cavs on Tuesday night.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NBA has released the dates for the Celtics' first-round matchup with the Nets.
Before the Celtics' regular-season finale against the Grizzlies, Ime Udoka said they don't anticipate Williams returning in Round 1.
But Game 5 of this series is four weeks from when he had surgery, and Williams is on a 4-6 week timetable.
That leaves the door open for the Timelord to return in Round 1, depending on how his recovery progresses.
The Celtics won't rush Williams' return, and they can beat the Nets without him.

The Miami Heat are resting and waiting on their first-round opponents to be determined.
However, if there were a preferred path or bracket, a “less hostile” one if you will, it would be the side that the Miami Heat currently find themselves on right now.
The Miami Heat currently find themselves on one of those paths at the moment.
It all begins on Sunday though and against one of three teams that the Miami Heat beat in the closing months of the season.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His teammate, Bruce Brown, had just said something spicy during his postgame media session following the Brooklyn Nets’ 115-108 win in the play-in round on Tuesday.
Or maybe he just wanted one night without his team playing the lead character in the NBA season’s longest-running soap opera.
And when multiple players occupy that zone, as Irving and Durant did Tuesday night, they create the NBA’s worst math problem.
So if the rest of the playoffs resemble anything like the play-in game, they’ll be joining fingers a lot.
Let’s just go out there and hoop.”A basketball team keeping its focus on just basketball.

     Summary: Forty-five minutes after the Brooklyn Nets earned the No.
7 seed with a 115-108 win against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the play-in opener, Durant said that his teammate had "said something I didn't like.
When a reporter asked Durant about their upcoming opponents, he kept it simple: Brooklyn has to stay disciplined, play together and play with passion.
Rather than talking about strategies the Nets might use against Tatum, he said that they just have to play hard and "see what happens."
"I'm just making the right play, that's all," he said.
