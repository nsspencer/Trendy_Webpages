     Putin vows Russia will press Ukraine invasion till goals met
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: which has been torn by fighting between Russian-allied separatists and Ukrainian forces since 2014, and where Russia has recognized the separatists’ claims of independence.
“And then we’ll use chemical troops to smoke them out of there,” the official, Eduard Basurin, said.
He denied Tuesday that separatist forces had used chemical weapons in Mariupol.
Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said officials were investigating, and it was possible phosphorus munitions — which cause horrendous burns but are not classed as chemical weapons — had been used in Mariupol.
In the face of stiff resistance by Ukrainian forces bolstered by Western weapons, Russian forces have increasingly relied on bombarding cities, flattening many urban areas and leaving thousands of people dead.

     Ukraine investigates claim of poisonous substance dropped in Mariupol
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukraine investigated a claim that a poisonous substance was dropped on besieged Mariupol, as Western officials warned Tuesday that any use of chemical weapons by Russia would be a serious escalation of the already devastating war.
And leaders inside and outside of the country said they were urgently investigating the unconfirmed claim by a Ukrainian regiment that a poisonous substance was dropped on fighters in Mariupol.
In the face of stiff resistance by Ukrainian forces bolstered by Western weapons, Russian forces have increasingly relied on bombarding cities, flattening many urban areas and leaving thousands of people dead.
Still, there are fears of even wider carnage to come, amid signs the Russian military is gearing up for a major offensive in the Donbas.
The assertion by the Azov Regiment, a far-right group now part of the Ukrainian military, could not be independently verified.

     Putin says peace talks at 'dead end,' US 'deeply' concerned about chemical weapons: Live Ukraine updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia's audacious invasion of Ukraine is proceeding as planned and peace talks have reached a "dead end," Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, urged the European Union to step up economic sanctions against Russia.
Russian forces remain about 12 miles south of the town.
The focus of the Russian invasion, which began Feb. 24, has moved into eastern and southern Ukraine, the official said.
Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said Russian forces have blocked weeks of attempted humanitarian convoys into the city in part to conceal the carnage.
