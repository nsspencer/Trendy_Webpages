     Stranger Things 4’s new trailer teases a guitar battle in the Upside Down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even though we’ve seen a few teasers of Stranger Things’ upcoming fourth season, none of them really let on just how much larger and epic in scope this next chapter seems like it’s going to be.
While Stranger Things has explored the larger world outside of Hawkins, Indiana, in the past, the show’s fourth season is set to switch things up by splitting its story across a handful of disparate, important locations.
Though the story will presumably return to the Upside Down and catch up with Jim Hopper in Russia, Stranger Things’ first season four trailer makes clear that a significant part of its next chapter will unfold in California, where Joyce and the rest of the Byers family have moved.
1 of Stranger Things season 4 premieres on May 27th, 2022, and Vol.
2 drops on Netflix on July 1st, 2022.

     Stranger Things season 4 trailer introduces a new Upside Down enemy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stranger Things season 4 has its first real trailer.
Stranger Things season 4 is set to arrive on Netflix on May 27.
The trailer also makes it clear that this season is going for a more classic horror-movie vibe, complete with an eerie haunted house the kids will have to explore.
Stranger Things season 4 brings back just about everyone from the Stranger Things universe including David Harbour’s Jim Hopper, Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers, Maya Hawke as Robin, Joe Keery as Steve, and Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler.
In case you don’t remember what happened last time around (since the show hasn’t been around since 2019), Stranger Things season 3 once again brought the Upside Down to Hawkins.

     ‘Stranger Things’ Season 4 Trailer: Netflix’s Supernatural Hit Returns May 27
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This season promises to be a dramatic genre departure from the last, packed with '80s horror references.
Finally, Netflix released a full trailer April 12 for Season 4, which will roll out on the streamer in two parts: Volume 1 premieres May 27, while Volume 2 premieres July 1.
Plot details remain scarce for what to expect from the next slate of episodes, but “Stranger Things 4” picks up six months after the Battle of Starcourt, which brought terror and destruction to Hawkins.
“They’re not kids anymore — they really are full-blown teenagers,” co-creator Matt Duffer told Netflix’s Queue magazine.
The tone feels different,” Ross Duffer told Queue.
