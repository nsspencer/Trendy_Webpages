     Summary: Villarreal Party In Locker Room After Knocking Bayern Munich Out Of The Champions LeagueVillarreal shocked Europe to become Champions League semi-finalists after getting the better of six-time winners Bayern Munich over two legs.
Bayern had dominated the game and Robert Lewandowski's goal after 52 minutes was the least they deserved on the balance of play.

Villarreal are a team full of players who did not quite shine elsewhere but have been brought to life by manager Unai Emery.
No fewer than four members of Tuesday's team are former Tottenham players.

     Villarreal shock Bayern Munich to progress to Champions League semifinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Under a sky of blue and field of green, Villarreal – affectionately known as the “Yellow Submarine” due to its luminescent yellow kit – sunk Bayern Munich to reach the semifinals of the Champions League.
Villarreal fans celebrate their team's victory over Bayern Munich to reach the Champions League semifinals.
Stefan Matzke/Corbis/Getty ImagesThen, early in the second half, Bayern finally broke through the Spanish side’s steadfast defense when Robert Lewandowski scored his 13th Champions League goal of the campaign to equalize the tie on aggregate.
It will be the first Champions League semifinals for Emery – who has won four Europa League titles as a manager – while Villarreal has only reached this stage of the Champions League once before in 2005/06.
The Yellow Submarine is flying high in Europe’s top club competition after ending Juventus’ run in the round-of-16 and now Bayern Munich’s hopes of a seventh Champions League.

     It Wasn't Pretty, But Villareal Closed Out Bayern Munich
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bayern controlled 68 percent of the possession, had significantly more shots (23 to Villarreal’s 4), and generally looked as good as it usually does.
In the 88th minute, Villarreal was able to clear a Bayern attack from its own box, triggering one of a small number of counter-attacks the other way.
The Reds will pose a similar problem as Bayern: more talent, particularly in attack, only with added counter-attacking intensity if Villarreal were to commit men forward.
Before the past six days, this would feel like an impossible task, but Villarreal is playing with house money now.
Thanks to pragmatic defending and two goals when it mattered, Villarreal rides on, and Bayern gets sent home to wonder how it all went so wrong.

     Bayern Munich face uncertain future after exit that wasn’t such a shock
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a shock but also a logical end point, the surprise that you knew could be coming.
Domestically in recent weeks, Bayern have offered Borussia Dortmund routes back into the Bundesliga title race that Marco Rose’s side haven’t been good enough to take.
“I’ve been asked the question 1,734 times in the last few weeks,” he said after last month’s draw at Hoffenheim.
Doing it when Robert Lewandowski, Manuel Neuer, Müller and Gnabry are out of contract in 2023 is even trickier.
The scenario of Bayern coughing up for all of Gnabry, Neuer, Müller and Lewandowski is difficult to envisage.
