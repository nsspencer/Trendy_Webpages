     Clippers vs. Timberwolves: A battle for the No. 7 seed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Separated by four games in the Western Conference standings, the Clippers will be looking to upset the Minnesota Timberwolves for the No.
The Clippers won their of their four meetings with the Timberwolves in the regular season, but the Timberwolves have been an offensive juggernaut since the All-Star Break, scoring 119.4 points per 100 possessions.
Before their injuries started piling up, the Clippers were beating everyone in their path and the Timberwolves were no exception.
In the three games the Clippers played against the Timberwolves with George healthy, they went undefeated.
That’s not to say the Clippers will have it easy on Tuesday evening, but there’s enough evidence to suggest they have the Timberwolves’ number.
