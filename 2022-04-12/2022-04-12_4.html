     Globally, inflation is surging amid persistent pandemic disruptions and war in Ukraine.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just as in the United States, policymakers in other countries have been caught off guard by persistently high inflation.
Price increases were expected to ease as economies recovered from the pandemic, but surging energy and food prices have continued to lift inflation around the world.
After Russia invaded Ukraine, predictions about inflation were torn up and reset much higher in light of rising commodity prices.
Meanwhile, supply chains remain burdened by pandemic-induced disruptions, and demand for some goods is still stronger than production can handle.
In emerging economies, more than half the countries have inflation rates above 7 percent, the bank said.

     US inflation climbed to 8.5% in March, highest rate since 1981
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The gasoline index rose 18.3% in March and accounted for over half of all the items’ monthly increase.
Gas prices have begun to fall, in a sign that some economists have argued may suggest inflation has reached its peak.
The food index rose 1% in March compared with February, and is up 8.8% compared with the prior 12 months.
Canned fruit and vegetable prices rose 3.8% from February to March, rice prices rose 3.2%, potatoes 3.2% and ground beef 2.1%.
“At times, gas prices were more than one dollar above pre-invasion levels, so that roughly 25% increase in gas prices will drive tomorrow’s inflation reading,” Psaki said.

     No end in sight for spiking prices? Enter the ‘peak inflation’ crowd
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The predictions of “peak inflation” could comfort the White House, which has struggled under the political fallout of the consumer price hikes and faces the potential loss of Congress in this year’s elections.
Among the banks’ reasons for optimism: Used car prices, which propelled much of the inflation last year, have begun to fall.
Headline inflation refers to all price increases, while the core number excludes volatile food and energy costs.
Oil surged after the inflation numbers were released Tuesday, and housing costs haven’t even fully worked their way into the data.
Today’s grim inflation numbers have Democrats and their interest groups and economists worried that ever-rising prices will cost them both houses of Congress.

     Summary: How soaring inflation forces stark choicesEnlarge this image toggle caption Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty ImagesFrom rising rent to higher heating bills, surging inflation impacts everybody, but it poses a particular hardship for people with little extra money to spare.
These families have little fat in their household budgets to start with, so when inflation cuts into their limited spending power, something has to give.
After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, gasoline prices jumped to $4.33 a gallon in March — an all-time high, not adjusting for inflation.
"While all Americans are confronting higher prices, the burden is particularly great for households with more limited resources," Brainard said.
"That is why getting inflation down is our most important task, while sustaining a recovery that includes everyone."

     Prices climbed 8.5% in March compared to last year amid growing fears of economic slowdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The inflation surge in the United States picked up speed in March, as prices rose 8.5 percent compared with a year ago.
Gasoline, food, and a range of other products have become markedly more expensive, creating economic strains for households and businesses, and political problems for the White House and congressional Democrats.
Those moves drove up energy costs; crude oil soared to new highs last month, and rising gasoline prices quickly followed.
Unfortunately, the administration’s new scheme to address soaring gas prices by forcing more ethanol into the system will likely lead to higher corn, i.e.
food, prices.

     Inflation Continued to Worsen in March, as Gas and Rent Costs Rose: Live Updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stubbornly rapid price increases have been exacerbated by a recent surge in gas costs tied to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Fuel prices jumped sharply higher last month, with the U.S. average for a gallon of regular gas peaking at $4.33 on March 11.
Businesses may feel that they have the power to pass rising costs along to customers, and even to expand their profits, because consumers have continued to spend during a full year of rapid price increases.
Housing costs continued to increase relatively quickly, though there was some deceleration in an index of rent of primary residences.
Those costs are likely to be a major factor determining the course of inflation in the months ahead.
