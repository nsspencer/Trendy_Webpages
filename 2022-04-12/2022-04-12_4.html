     Summary: Damage control game = strong.
Again, Bohm would have been well within his rights to say "you guys are reading too far into this," but owning up to it was a much, much smarter move.
Thanks to that, and a Phillies win, the fans will forget about this entirely ... for 24 whole hours.
If Bohm makes another error or goes 0-for-4 with four strikeouts on Tuesday night, you can bet your life savings the fans will make sure he still "f---ing hates this place."
He should just keep it to himself the next time he says it, though.

Crossing Broad did a good job reading some lips as Bohm reacted to a Bronx cheer after making a routine play (NSFW).
I didn‚Äôt mean that‚ÄùCould this be an important turning point for Bohm?
Knowing the Phillies can come back, even if he should make an error (or, God forbid, three), maybe Bohm will relax next time.

     Summary: It was a a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad night for Alec Bohm.
Monday ended with a win for the Philadelphia Phillies, but for the third baseman, he struggled in the field before cameras caught him saying something that went VERY viral thanks to lip-readers on Twitter.
Bohm appeared to say, ‚ÄúI [expletive] hate this place‚Äù after Phillies fans gave him an extremely sarcastic cheer after he made a routine play at third for an out, something he failed to do when he committed three errors against the New York Mets.
But he did apologize after the game.

     Summary: Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm let his emotions get the better of him after an error-filled start to Monday night‚Äôs game against the Mets.
When his frustration level reached its peak, he made a rather pointed comment that roped in the city of Philadelphia and the team‚Äôs fanbase.
After making three errors in the first two innings of the game, Bohm finally righted the ship on a routine ground ball from New York‚Äôs Starling Marte in the top of the second.
Cameras flashed to Bohm following the play and showed him mouthing some choice words about the response from the crowd.
Bohm, 25, finished the game with three errors but drew two walks and scored an important run in the Phillies‚Äô 5‚Äì4 win.
