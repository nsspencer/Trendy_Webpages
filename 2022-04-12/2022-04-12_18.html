“He's got a chance to be one of the best in the game as long as he keeps working.

     Summary: The White Sox say they’re not measuring themselves against the other great teams in the league to see if they’ve made progress playing against better competition this year.
Playing in front of a lively sell-out crowd for their home opener, the White Sox gave us the first taste of how playoff baseball could be different on the South Side in 2022.

Maybe it was the traffic gridlock around the park before the game as confused drivers tried to find the correct parking lot, or maybe it was the long lines for the bathrooms and popular concessions.

     Summary: CHICAGO – One of the biggest stories before the home opener for the White Sox on Tuesday had nothing to do with someone on their roster.
So on Tuesday afternoon, White Sox fans were ready to give the Hall of Famer a warm welcome back to Guaranteed Rate Field.
A fun and heartwarming moment before the White Sox home opener against the Mariners as Hall of Famer Harold Baines throws the ceremonial first pitch to Bo Jackson.
In 2004, he joined Guillen’s White Sox coaching staff and would remain there under him and Robin Ventura through the 2015 season.
Baines was the bench coach when the White Sox won their first World Series in 88 years in 2005.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CHICAGO – A lot of the chatter before their first game at Guaranteed Rate Field in 2022 had to concern the players that weren’t on the White Sox for their home opener.
Yet for a second-straight year, the White Sox are showing their ability to fight through it for success in the very early going.
Aided by a strong game by Luis Robert and efforts by a quartet of bullpen pitchers, the White Sox beat the Mariners 3-1 at Guaranteed Rate Field to improve to 3-2 on the young season.
Vince Velasquez was able to go four innings in the first start of his White Sox career as he surrendered just a second inning homer to Eugenio Suarez.
Robert would help get the White Sox some insurance in the bottom of the eighth inning when he got a walk to lead off the inning.
