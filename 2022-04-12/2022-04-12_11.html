    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After dropping the the series opener Monday night, 3-1, the Red Sox will be back at it Tuesday afternoon in Detroit against the Tigers.
After mustering just four hits, the Sox hope to get the bats going in the middle game of the three-game series.
In their last three games, the Sox have just 14 hits.
They will again be doing so without second baseman Trevor Story, who missed the past two games due to an illness and rejoined the Sox from New York after Monday’s game.
He is feeling weak and is not in the lineup Tuesday.

     Boston at Detroit Preview: One trip through the rotation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Tigers are still longshots to make the 2022 MLB playoffs but there are enough pieces on the squad to at least make this season interesting.
One of the ways the Tigers can exceed expectations is getting enhanced contributions from the bottom half of the roster.
He was quite effective down the stretch, posting a 2.91 ERA and 3.96 FIP from August onward.
While once a solid strikeout pitcher, Hill has seen these numbers fall over the last couple seasons.
If Detroit waits for its pitches there are runs to be had against Hill, despite some tough sledding from the offense thus far.

     Red Sox at Tigers lineups: It’s W-2 season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rich Hill makes the first start of his third go-round with the Red Sox as Boston looks to win their second game of the year this afternoon against lefty Tyler Alexander and the Tigers (1:05 p.m., NESN).
It hasn’t been a slow start for the Sox, exactly, but the runs have come at the wrong times and the leads haven’t stood up.
The Sunday night game to Monday afternoon game to Tuesday afternoon game schedule can’t be helping too much, but you play the hand you’re dealt, and the Sox will play their hand here.
This is a lefty-lefty matchup, so the Sox break out the righty bats.
Kevin Plawecki is behind the dish, and Jonathan Araúz plays second and bats ninth with Trevor Story still out for what he said this morning was food poisoning.
