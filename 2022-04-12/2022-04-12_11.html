     Pentagon monitoring reports of possible Russian chemical weapons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pentagon is closely monitoring social media reports claiming Russian forces deployed chemical weapons in Mariupol, Ukraine, Defense Department press secretary John Kirby said on Monday.
Why it matters: Moscow has a long history of using chemical weapons, and the White House has warned that Russian forces may be preparing to "use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine."
What they're saying: "We are aware of social media reports which claim Russian forces deployed a potential chemical munition in Mariupol, Ukraine," Kirby said Monday evening in a statement to outlets including Axios.
"One of the mouthpieces of the occupiers stated that they could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol.
France has already sent crime scene and forensic experts to help investigate possible war crimes in parts of Ukraine previously occupied by Russian forces.

     Putin vows to press invasion until Russia's goals are met
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “And then we’ll use chemical troops to smoke them out of there,” the official, Eduard Basurin, said.
Much of the city has been razed in weeks of pummeling by Russian troops.
Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, acknowledged the challenges Ukrainian troops face in Mariupol.
Deliberately firing them into an enclosed space to expose people to fumes could breach the Chemical Weapons Convention, said Marc-Michael Blum, a former laboratory head at the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
In the face of stiff resistance by Ukrainian forces bolstered by Western weapons, Russian forces have increasingly relied on bombarding cities, flattening many urban areas and leaving thousands of people dead.

NBC's Al Roker asked the former president if the Russian president is the same Putin he dealt with during his two terms in the White House.
Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of blocking attempted humanitarian convoys and hampering efforts to evacuate residents.
Russia has denied responsibility for the attack and has consistently denied targeting civilians in its assault on Ukraine.
It said Russian forces have continued to withdraw from Belarus as they look to redeploy to support operations in eastern Ukraine.
