     Shiba Inu (SHIB) Jumps 20% Following Robinhood Listing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) today jumped in price by 20%—a spike seemingly caused by Robinhood today adding support for the asset.
At the moment, SHIB is currently trading for $0.00002674, according to CoinMarketCap data, having cooled slightly but still up 16% for the day.
It runs on the Ethereum network and seemingly sprung out of nowhere last year to become a significant player in the crypto world.
The price of SHIB is a lot more volatile than other assets with big market caps, such as MATIC, which powers the Polygon network.
Polygon is an Ethereum sidechain that was designed to speed up transactions and ease the load on the main Ethereum network.

     Why Shiba Inu Is Soaring Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ET today, the price of Shiba Inu ( SHIB 17.09% ) had risen as much as 24% after the token was added to Robinhood's online investing platform.
The news is good for Shiba Inu because it makes the token accessible to potentially a whole new group of retail traders who have been asking Robinhood for more tokens.
In other news, Shiba Inu is expected to add a new burning portal to its network, which will burn tokens on every transaction, potentially removing trillions of tokens from circulation, which investors hope will drive up the price.
Shiba Inu reportedly has roughly 1 quadrillion tokens in circulation.

     Summary: "We are seeing that creators are selling their videos and memes as NFTs," Wojcicki told livestreamer Ludwig Ahgren on a recent podcast episode of The Yard.
"If creators are selling their videos as NFTs, then that's an important form of monetization.
“At the end of the day what YouTube does is, we’re a platform that distributes content and monetization,” she said.
“I don’t think [Shorts funds are] permanent,” Wojcicki said.
“YouTube has a great monetization program for long-form creators, and we want to extend that for Shorts,” Wojcicki said.
