     After a string of 40-year highs, will inflation slow down? Some economists think so.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Has the nation’s nerve-jangling bout of inflation peaked?
Annual consumer price increases hit yet another 40-year high of 8.5% in March, and several research firms – including Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo – say that probably marks the worst of it.
After six months of steady advances in the consumer price index (CPI), the past five of which set fresh four-decade highs, the yearly rises should slowly decline through 2022, the economists say.
And though prices will continue to move higher month to month, the increases should be less dramatic.

     Inflation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Year-over-year CPI inflation rose from 7.9 percent in February to 8.5 percent in March, while the “core” inflation (non-food, non-energy) edged up from 6.4 percent to 6.5 percent.
The chart (below) compares CPI commodities inflation with CPI services inflation.
With one-quarter of 2022 in the rearview mirror, there is a clear uptick in the pace of services inflation (now up to 5.1 percent), but no sign of abating goods inflation.
It compares the real (inflation-adjusted) federal policy rate (the federal funds rate) with the core inflation rate.
Clearly, inflation is a big, big problem and the Federal Reserve is way, way behind the curve in controlling it.

     This key inflation measure just saw its biggest gain on record
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) US inflation kept moving higher in March and the Producer Price Index is the latest data point showing the price pressure.
It was the biggest jump in prices since the data series began in November 2010, exceeding analysts'expectations and the double-digit jumps recorded in the first two months of the year.
Without energy and food, the PPI stood at 9.2% over the same time frame.
Stripping out trade services as well, the index increased 7% over the 12-month period.
These numbers show that while energy costs play a huge role in the price spikes, there is still plenty of inflation beneath the surface.

     Why inflation may have already peaked
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What they're saying: Inflation "has likely peaked," said Bank of America analysts on Tuesday.
How it works: The headline inflation figure, which spiked by 1.2% in March alone, has been driven overwhelmingly by energy prices.
The other side: Any declaration that inflation has peaked is necessarily "provisional at best," wrote RSM's Joe Brusuelas in a research note, given the volatility and unpredictability of oil prices in a time of war.
The central bank tries to ignore volatile food and energy prices, but core inflation, at 6.7%, is well above the Fed's 2% target.
The bottom line: We may be moving from inflation being high and rising, to inflation being high and falling.

     Inflation’s 40-Year High
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Given these stakes, today I want to walk through the reasons that inflation might stay high, and the reasons it might not, over the next few months.
Consider wages: If people expect high inflation, they will demand higher pay.
But to pay higher wages, employers are likely to pass that cost to consumers by charging them higher prices.
Higher wages could also mean elevated demand, because people will have more money to spend.
This “wage-price spiral,” as economists call it, was a major contributor to high inflation in the 1970s.

     Inflation hits 7% in March as Britain’s cost of living soars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Highlighting the scale of Britain’s worsening cost of living emergency, the last time the CPI inflation rate was higher was February 1982 during the first Thatcher government, when it reached 10.4%.
With inflation surpassing expectations among City economists for a reading of 6.7% on the month, experts said the measure for the rising cost of living was now likely to rise by more than expected in the coming months.
According to the latest snapshot from the ONS, rising costs for gas and electricity bills added to pressure on household living costs in March.
“The latest rise in inflation will not be the last,” said Alpesh Paleja, the lead economist at the CBI business lobby group.
Jack Leslie, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the cost of living crisis was on track to be the biggest squeeze since the mid-1970s.
