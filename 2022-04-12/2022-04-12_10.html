     Shiba Inu, Solana Among Four Cryptocurrencies Listed on Robinhood (HOOD)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Robinhood Markets Inc. included four new cryptocurrencies on its platform, including the Shiba Inu coin, in a win for proponents who had long argued in favor of the joke token becoming available for trading.
The platform popular with daytraders also added Solana’s SOL, Polygon’s Matic and Compound’s COMP to its list of available trades in a possible appeal to users now that the surge in retail trading that came during the outbreak of the pandemic lockdowns has abated.
Prices of all the tokens listed rose.
Shares of Robinhood were up 4.6% as of 9:33 a.m. in New York.

     Shiba Inu (SHIB) Jumps 20% Following Robinhood Listing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) today jumped in price by 20%—a spike seemingly caused by Robinhood today adding support for the asset.
At the moment, SHIB is currently trading for $0.00002674, according to CoinMarketCap data, having cooled slightly but still up 16% for the day.
It runs on the Ethereum network and seemingly sprung out of nowhere last year to become a significant player in the crypto world.
The price of SHIB is a lot more volatile than other assets with big market caps, such as MATIC, which powers the Polygon network.
Polygon is an Ethereum sidechain that was designed to speed up transactions and ease the load on the main Ethereum network.

Each of these tokens has had a rough start to 2022 TradingViewEver since Robinhood began offering crypto trading in 2018, customers had been clamoring for the opportunity to buy and sell more tokens.
However, the company avoided listing SHIB until now because of fears about its outsize volatility, even for crypto.

"If creators are selling their videos as NFTs, then that's an important form of monetization.
“At the end of the day what YouTube does is, we’re a platform that distributes content and monetization,” she said.
“I don’t think [Shorts funds are] permanent,” Wojcicki said.
“YouTube has a great monetization program for long-form creators, and we want to extend that for Shorts,” Wojcicki said.

     Breaking: Shiba Inu Is Now Listed on Robinhood. Should You Buy?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Key pointsTrading app Robinhood announced on its official Twitter channel today that it was listing a handful of cryptocurrencies including Shiba Inu.
The Shiba Inu token soared as high as 31% within the first hours of the news and has since settled back to a 19.65% pump at time of writing according to CoinMarketCap.
After months of lobbying, and 559,701 petition signatures, popular dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been listed on mobile trading app Robinhood along with three other top-100 cryptos.
Is Shiba Inu a buy?
Frankly, that's very surprising especially when you consider the extremely positive news cycle Shiba Inu has enjoyed over the past few weeks.
