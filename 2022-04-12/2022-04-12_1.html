     Summary: Mayor Eric Adams (D) said it was “premature” to rule out terrorism as the motive for the attack on the subway.
Adams, in an interview with CNN while he’s isolated with covid-19, noted the investigation had just started and said officials would share more soon.
“This is terror,” Adams said.
“Someone attempted to terrorize our system.
