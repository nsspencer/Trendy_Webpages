     Brooklyn subway station shooter injured at least 29, and wore gas mask
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — Several New York public schools in Sunset Park are emerging from an early-morning lockdown that was enacted immediately after Tuesday’s early morning 911 call reporting shots fired at the 36th Street Station.
“Out of an abundance of caution and for the safety of our students we have placed all schools in the area in a shelter-in-place,” New York Schools Chancellor David C. Banks later said in a statement Tuesday morning, adding, “My thoughts go out to the victims of this tragedy.”Schools were advised to lock their doors and not permit outside visitors.
At midday, students at Sunset Park High School banged on classroom windows as reporters and police walked past, yelling that they had no idea when they would be released from lockdown.
Families received emails from the school around 10 a.m. alerting them the shelter in place protocol had been activated, with another update just before midday communicating that student’s daily activities were largely unaffected by the lockdown, save lunch and recess that would normally be outdoors.
The lockdown was lifted shortly before 1 p.m., with families advised that school staff would wait with students during dismissal and pickup in case parents and guardians had commuting delays.

     Summary: A gunman wearing a gas mask filled a crowded New York subway car with thick black smoke from a canister and opened fire on morning rush-hour passengers, injuring 16, including 10 with gunshot wounds.
Graphic photographs posted on social media showed the traumatic scenes on the platform of 36th Street station in the Sunset Park neighbourhood of Brooklyn around 8.30am.
Yav Montano, who was present inside the carriage as the attack unfolded, shared with CNN a 10-second video he captured as the train drew into the 36th Street station.

He also said his employees herded as many riders as they could on to a train leaving the 36th Street station, in order to get them out of harm’s way.

     Live Updates: 16 People Are Injured, Including 10 Shot, in Attack on Brooklyn Subway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The search for the gunman was being hampered Tuesday afternoon by the fact that a security camera at the 36th Street subway station that might have captured the scene was not operating, Mayor Eric Adams said.
A senior law enforcement official said that a gun had been found inside the subway station.
Police officers were called to the 36th Street station, where the D, N and R lines all stop, after receiving reports of smoke and gunshots.
Patrick Berry, 41, said he was waiting at the 25th Street station, one stop north, when an R train arrived at around 8:30 a.m.
Around the 36th Street station, dozens of police vehicles with flashing lights clogged the streets and helicopters flew overhead.
