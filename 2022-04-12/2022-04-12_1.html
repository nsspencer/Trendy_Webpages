     Brooklyn subway station shooter injured at least 18, and wore gas mask
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kathy Hochul (D) urged residents to remain on alert as officials continue the search for the perpetrator of Tuesday’s subway shooting.
Hochul in brief remarks during a midday news briefing decried the shooter as “coldhearted” for disrupting the sense of normalcy in residents’ everyday lives.
“This was disrupted, brutally disrupted, by an individual so coldhearted and depraved of heart that they had no caring about the individuals they assaulted as they went about their daily lives,” Hochul said.
Hochul said people around the state were standing in solidarity with New Yorkers in decrying violence and called on residents to report what they see.
“It’s likely that someone out there listening to this is going to help us find this individual.

     Brooklyn shooting: 16 injured, including 10 shot, in New York subway attack

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A gunman wearing a gas mask filled a crowded New York subway car with thick black smoke from a canister and opened fire on morning rush-hour passengers, injuring 16, including 10 with gunshot wounds.
Graphic photographs posted on social media showed the traumatic scenes on the platform of 36th Street station in the Sunset Park neighbourhood of Brooklyn around 8.30am.
Yav Montano, who was present inside the carriage as the attack unfolded, shared with CNN a 10-second video he captured as the train drew into the 36th Street station.

He also said his employees herded as many riders as they could on to a train leaving the 36th Street station, in order to get them out of harm’s way.

     Live Updates: 16 People Are Injured, Including 10 Shot, in Attack on Brooklyn Subway
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As of Tuesday afternoon, he had not yet been publicly identified and remained at large, though a senior law enforcement official said that a gun had been found inside the subway station.
John Butsikares, 15, a freshman at Brooklyn Technical High School, said his ride on a northbound R train from Bay Ridge had been calm — until the train approached the 36th Street station.
In a separate interview on CNN, Mayor Eric Adams said officials did not yet know the identity of the gunman.
Patrick Berry, 41, said he was waiting at the 25th Street station, one stop north, when an R train arrived at around 8:30 a.m.
The area around the 36th Street station was surrounded by investigators and cordoned off.
