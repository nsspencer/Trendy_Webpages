     WNBA Players Association president says Brittney Griner is detained in Russia 'because of a gender issue'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As seven-time WNBA All-Star Brittney Griner enters her 54th day in Russian custody, the WNBA Players Association has a new message amid concerns over her safety and mental health.
Nneka Ogwumike, President of the WNBA Players Association, joined "Good Morning America" Tuesday to shine a new light on Griner's detainment and explain the overall mood among her fellow WNBA players.
Griner had vape cartridges containing hashish oil -- an offense punishable in Russia by up to 10 years in prison -- according to Russian state media.
Ogwumike said she believes there is a gender issue at play in Griner's case.
It's disappointing that the question of it being a gender issue is top of mind now when it comes to this type of circumstance and the reality is she's over there because of a gender issue, pay inequity," she said.

     Is Brittney Griner a Russian hostage?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, right now U.S. citizens are more often taken hostage by foreign governments than by nonstate actors.
Sadly, it seems that the detention of WNBA champ Brittney Griner by Russian authorities may be part of that trend.
And Griner was purportedly denied consular access — a basic right of any foreign national in detention — until March 23.
President Joe Biden has taken a more subdued approach, sending members of his administration to be the public faces handling hostage files.
Brittney Griner is in Russian detention and may be there for geopolitical gains wholly unrelated to any of her actions.
