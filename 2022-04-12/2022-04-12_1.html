     Summary: As he walked up the station’s platform at the 36th Street station, French encountered white opaque smoke that seemed to get denser and denser as he kept walking.
It wasn’t until French came across a group of people scattered across the ground on the platform and he saw the blood and wounds that he knew: There was a shooting.
They said the man got away and one of the injured had walked onto another local train.
In the ensuing panic, French said he and other New Yorkers applied tourniquets to the wounded until first responders arrived, offering their clothes to help stop the bleeding.
When police and firefighters got there, French took out his phone and captured the graphic scene — injured commuters sprawled on the platform’s floor stained with blood.
