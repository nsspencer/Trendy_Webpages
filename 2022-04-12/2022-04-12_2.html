     US inflation climbed to 8.5% in March, highest rate since 1981

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The gasoline index rose 18.3% in March and accounted for over half of all the items’ monthly increase.
Gas prices have begun to fall, in a sign that some economists have argued may suggest inflation has reached its peak.
The food index rose 1% in March compared with February, and is up 8.8% compared with the prior 12 months.
Canned fruit and vegetable prices rose 3.8% from February to March, rice prices rose 3.2%, potatoes 3.2% and ground beef 2.1%.
“At times, gas prices were more than one dollar above pre-invasion levels, so that roughly 25% increase in gas prices will drive tomorrow’s inflation reading,” Psaki said.

     No end in sight for spiking prices? Enter the ‘peak inflation’ crowd
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The predictions of “peak inflation” could comfort the White House, which has struggled under the political fallout of the consumer price hikes and faces the potential loss of Congress in this year’s elections.
Among the banks’ reasons for optimism: Used car prices, which propelled much of the inflation last year, have begun to fall.
Headline inflation refers to all price increases, while the core number excludes volatile food and energy costs.
Oil surged after the inflation numbers were released Tuesday, and housing costs haven’t even fully worked their way into the data.
Today’s grim inflation numbers have Democrats and their interest groups and economists worried that ever-rising prices will cost them both houses of Congress.

     Summary: How soaring inflation forces stark choicesEnlarge this image toggle caption Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty ImagesFrom rising rent to higher heating bills, surging inflation impacts everybody, but it poses a particular hardship for people with little extra money to spare.
These families have little fat in their household budgets to start with, so when inflation cuts into their limited spending power, something has to give.
After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, gasoline prices jumped to $4.33 a gallon in March — an all-time high, not adjusting for inflation.
"While all Americans are confronting higher prices, the burden is particularly great for households with more limited resources," Brainard said.
"That is why getting inflation down is our most important task, while sustaining a recovery that includes everyone."

     U.S. inflation rises 8.5 percent, sharpest increase since 1981
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Labor Department said Tuesday that its consumer price index jumped 8.5 percent in March from 12 months earlier, the sharpest year-over-year increase since December 1981.
Even excluding volatile food and energy prices, which have driven overall inflation, so-called core inflation jumped 6.5 percent over the past 12 months, the biggest such increase since 1982.
Even before Russia’s war further spurred price increases, robust consumer spending, steady pay raises and chronic supply shortages had sent U.S. consumer inflation to its highest level in four decades.
In addition, housing costs, which make up about a third of the consumer price index, have escalated, a trend that seems unlikely to reverse anytime soon.
Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said he expects year-over-year consumer inflation to still be 4.5 percent by the end of 2022.

     Inflation Continued to Worsen in March, as Gas and Rent Costs Rose: Live Updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stubbornly rapid price increases have been exacerbated by a recent surge in gas costs tied to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Fuel prices jumped sharply higher last month, with the U.S. average for a gallon of regular gas peaking at $4.33 on March 11.
Businesses may feel that they have the power to pass rising costs along to customers, and even to expand their profits, because consumers have continued to spend during a full year of rapid price increases.
Housing costs continued to increase relatively quickly, though there was some deceleration in an index of rent of primary residences.
Those costs are likely to be a major factor determining the course of inflation in the months ahead.

     Summary: Higher inflation means the buying power of workers' take-home pay is shrinking.
"Food prices also [saw] a big increase, with food-at-home costs rising 1.5 percent just in the past month, further squeezing household budgets."
Regarding pay, 40 percent of workers said they left their job for a company that offered them a raise of 10 percent or greater.
Within that group, 13 percent said they received a salary increase of 20 percent or more.
If workers don't get a raise:31 percent will ask to revisit the salary conversation in a few months.

     Prices climbed 8.5% in March compared to last year amid growing fears of economic slowdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadPrices rose 8.5 percent in March compared with a year ago, the largest annual increase since December 1981, as Russia’s war in Ukraine sent energy prices soaring.
The inflation data, released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed prices rose 1.2 percent in March compared with February.
But Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine created a new burst of uncertainty and pushed prices even higher.
Those moves drove up energy costs; crude oil soared to new highs last month, and rising gasoline prices quickly followed.
Rice prices rose 3.2 percent, ground beef grew 2.1 percent, and eggs were up 1.9 percent.

     EXPLAINER: Why US inflation is so high, and when it may ease
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Back in December 2020, the Fed's policymakers had forecast that consumer inflation would stay below their 2% annual target and end 2021 at around 1.8%.
Yet after having been merely an afterthought for decades, high inflation reasserted itself last year with brutal speed.
Elevated consumer price inflation could endure as long as companies struggle to keep up with consumers' demand for goods and services.
The strong job market is boosting workers' pay, though not enough to offset higher prices.
The Labor Department says that after accounting for higher consumer prices, hourly earnings for private-sector employees fell 2.7% last month from a year earlier, the 12th straight such drop.
