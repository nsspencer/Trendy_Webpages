     Summary: Prices rose 1.2% from their February level, the sharpest monthly increase since September 2005.
Excluding volatile food and energy items, so-called core prices rose 6.5% annually in March, the largest advance since August 1982.
Why are food prices going up?
Grocery prices increased 1.5 from the prior month and 10% over the past year.
Breakfast cereal prices rose 2.4% monthly and 9.2% from a year ago.

     US inflation climbed to 8.5% in March, highest rate since 1981

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The gasoline index rose 18.3% in March and accounted for over half of all the items’ monthly increase.
Gas prices have begun to fall, in a sign that some economists have argued may suggest inflation has reached its peak.
The food index rose 1% in March compared with February, and is up 8.8% compared with the prior 12 months.
Canned fruit and vegetable prices rose 3.8% from February to March, rice prices rose 3.2%, potatoes 3.2% and ground beef 2.1%.
“At times, gas prices were more than one dollar above pre-invasion levels, so that roughly 25% increase in gas prices will drive tomorrow’s inflation reading,” Psaki said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: March inflation numbers are the first to include the hike in petrol prices spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.
The United States Department of Labor said Tuesday that its consumer price index jumped 8.5 percent in March from 12 months earlier — the biggest year-over-year increase since December 1981.
Even before Russia’s war further spurred price increases, robust consumer spending, steady pay raises and chronic supply shortages had sent US consumer inflation to its highest level in four decades.
In addition, housing costs, which make up about a third of the consumer price index, have escalated, a trend that seems unlikely to reverse anytime soon.
Luke Tilley, Wilmington Trust economist, said he expects year-over-year consumer inflation to still be 4.5 percent by the end of 2020.

     Inflation Continued to Worsen in March, as Gas and Rent Costs Rose: Live Updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stubbornly rapid price increases have been exacerbated by a recent surge in gas costs tied to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Fuel prices jumped sharply higher last month, with the U.S. average for a gallon of regular gas peaking at $4.33 on March 11.
Businesses may feel that they have the power to pass rising costs along to customers, and even to expand their profits, because consumers have continued to spend during a full year of rapid price increases.
Housing costs continued to increase relatively quickly, though there was some deceleration in an index of rent of primary residences.
Those costs are likely to be a major factor determining the course of inflation in the months ahead.

     Inflation hits new 40-year high of 8.5-percent due to war, rent hikes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. inflation data hit a multidecade high last month amid surging gas prices and skyrocketing rents, climbing to 8.5 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday.
Although gas prices have begun to trend downward recently, the change was not reflected in the inflation reading for March — a month that saw record high prices at the pump.
That, in turn, is pushing consumers' expectations of future inflation higher.
Household responseOther economists are more sanguine about whether households can absorb higher inflation.
While he expects core goods inflation, excluding autos, to remain high until supply constraints ease, he wrote that those components account for less than 10 percent of "core" inflation readings.

     Prices climbed 8.5% in March compared to last year amid growing fears of economic slowdown

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadPrices rose 8.5 percent in March compared with a year ago, the largest annual increase since December 1981, as Russia’s war in Ukraine sent energy prices soaring.
The inflation data, released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed prices rose 1.2 percent in March compared with February.
But Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine created a new burst of uncertainty and pushed prices even higher.
Those moves drove up energy costs; crude oil soared to new highs last month, and rising gasoline prices quickly followed.
Rice prices rose 3.2 percent, ground beef grew 2.1 percent, and eggs were up 1.9 percent.

Once public expectations for inflation rise, they can be self-fulfilling: Workers typically demand higher pay to offset their expectations for price increases.
Still, for now, with the job market healthy, inflation has yet to dampen overall consumer spending.
Levi Strauss &amp; Co., for example, says its price increases don’t seem to have fazed its customers.
