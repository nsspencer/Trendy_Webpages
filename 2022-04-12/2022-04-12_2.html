     Globally, inflation is surging amid persistent pandemic disruptions and war in Ukraine.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just as in the United States, policymakers in other countries have been caught off guard by persistently high inflation.
Price increases were expected to ease as economies recovered from the pandemic, but surging energy and food prices have continued to lift inflation around the world.
After Russia invaded Ukraine, predictions about the future of inflation were torn up and reset much higher in light of rising commodity prices.
Meanwhile, supply chains remain burdened by pandemic-induced disruptions and demand for some goods is still stronger than production can handle.
In emerging economies, more than half the countries have inflation rates above 7 percent, the bank said.

     Inflation is crushing Joe Biden and Democrats

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prices rose 8.5% from March 2021 to March 2022, while they increased 1.2% from February to March.
Half of the increase in the CPI was due to rising gas prices in March.
The Biden administration had been expecting a bad CPI number.
The problem for Biden (and his party) is that it's not at all clear that people care why everything they are trying to buy costs more.
All they know is that gas prices are through the roof -- although they are lower this week than last -- and everything they want or need to buy costs more (a lot more) than it did a year ago.

     Summary: The gasoline index rose 18.3% in March and accounted for over half of all the items’ monthly increase.
Gas prices have begun to fall, in a sign that some economists have argued may suggest inflation has reached its peak.
The food index rose 1% in March compared with February, and is up 8.8% compared with the prior 12 months.
Canned fruit and vegetable prices rose 3.8% from February to March, rice prices rose 3.2%, potatoes 3.2% and ground beef 2.1%.
“At times, gas prices were more than one dollar above pre-invasion levels, so that roughly 25% increase in gas prices will drive tomorrow’s inflation reading,” Psaki said.

     US inflation jumped 8.5 percent in past year, highest since 1981
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: March inflation numbers are the first to include the hike in petrol prices spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.
The United States Department of Labor said Tuesday that its consumer price index jumped 8.5 percent in March from 12 months earlier — the biggest year-over-year increase since December 1981.
Even before Russia’s war further spurred price increases, robust consumer spending, steady pay raises and chronic supply shortages had sent US consumer inflation to its highest level in four decades.
In addition, housing costs, which make up about a third of the consumer price index, have escalated, a trend that seems unlikely to reverse anytime soon.
Luke Tilley, Wilmington Trust economist, said he expects year-over-year consumer inflation to still be 4.5 percent by the end of 2020.

     Summary: How soaring inflation forces stark choicesEnlarge this image toggle caption Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty ImagesFrom rising rent to higher heating bills, surging inflation impacts everybody, but it poses a particular hardship for people with little extra money to spare.
These families have little fat in their household budgets to start with, so when inflation cuts into their limited spending power, something has to give.
After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, gasoline prices jumped to $4.33 a gallon in March — an all-time high, not adjusting for inflation.
"While all Americans are confronting higher prices, the burden is particularly great for households with more limited resources," Brainard said.
"That is why getting inflation down is our most important task, while sustaining a recovery that includes everyone."

     Inflation Continued to Worsen in March, as Gas and Rent Costs Rose: Live Updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stubbornly rapid price increases have been exacerbated by a recent surge in gas costs tied to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Fuel prices jumped sharply higher last month, with the U.S. average for a gallon of regular gas peaking at $4.33 on March 11.
Businesses may feel that they have the power to pass rising costs along to customers, and even to expand their profits, because consumers have continued to spend during a full year of rapid price increases.
Housing costs continued to increase relatively quickly, though there was some deceleration in an index of rent of primary residences.
Those costs are likely to be a major factor determining the course of inflation in the months ahead.

     Prices climbed 8.5% in March compared to last year amid growing fears of economic slowdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadPrices rose 8.5 percent in March compared with a year ago, the largest annual increase since December 1981, as Russia’s war in Ukraine sent energy prices soaring.
The inflation data, released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed prices rose 1.2 percent in March compared with February.
But Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine created a new burst of uncertainty and pushed prices even higher.
Those moves drove up energy costs; crude oil soared to new highs last month, and rising gasoline prices quickly followed.
Rice prices rose 3.2 percent, ground beef grew 2.1 percent, and eggs were up 1.9 percent.
