     Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm says 'I f---ing hate this place' about Philadelphia, lives to tell the tale

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Damage control game = strong.
Again, Bohm would have been well within his rights to say "you guys are reading too far into this," but owning up to it was a much, much smarter move.
Thanks to that, and a Phillies win, the fans will forget about this entirely ... for 24 whole hours.
If Bohm makes another error or goes 0-for-4 with four strikeouts on Tuesday night, you can bet your life savings the fans will make sure he still "f---ing hates this place."
He should just keep it to himself the next time he says it, though.

     Alec Bohm apologizes to Phillies fans after lip-readers spotted him saying 'I [expletive] hate this place'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad night for Alec Bohm.
Monday ended with a win for the Philadelphia Phillies, but for the third baseman, he struggled in the field before cameras caught him saying something that went VERY viral thanks to lip-readers on Twitter.
Bohm appeared to say, “I [expletive] hate this place” after Phillies fans gave him an extremely sarcastic cheer after he made a routine play at third for an out, something he failed to do when he committed three errors against the New York Mets.
But he did apologize after the game.

     Phillies' Alec Bohm says emotions got best of him after errors, leading to choice words
    </h2>

     Summary: PHILADELPHIA -- Alec Bohm might find it easier in Philadelphia to make up for errors in the field than one with his mouth.The three E-5s were nothing compared to one F-bomb he dropped in frustration.Lip-readers ran wild when cameras caught Bohm having some choice words after his second error.
His second error was in the second, a routine grounder that he threw over first baseman Hoskins and into foul territory.
Bohm completed the trifecta in the third on a wide throw that pulled Hoskins off the bag.
"I think it's a kid that was frustrated," Phillies manager Joe Girardi said.
"I don't think that kid was referring to, you know, the city of Philadelphia, the fans.

The progress that he’s made offensively, I think he’s growing up a little bit.

Knowing the Phillies can come back, even if he should make an error (or, God forbid, three), maybe Bohm will relax next time.

The NBC Sports Philadelphia telecast then caught Bohm mouthing, “I [expletive] hate this place.”Postgame, he confirmed the comment and apologized.
And, I mean, you heard it — we come back, they’re great.”With a smile, Bohm indicated that he does indeed love this place.
Does Alec Bohm actually "hate this place?"
“He’s a young man that has worked really hard and has to overcome some things, but it was not a fun situation to be, at the time.”“Made some mistakes,” Bohm added.
