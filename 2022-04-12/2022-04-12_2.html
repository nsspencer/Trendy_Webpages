     Gilbert Gottfried, Comedian With a Distinctive Voice, Dies at 67
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gilbert Gottfried, the comedian who gave voice to the parrot in the hit Disney animated feature “Aladdin” and the duck in commercials for Aflac insurance — and whose manic, loudmouthed and highly original stand-up routines mixed old-fashioned borscht-belt shtick with cringeworthy vulgarity — has died.
His family announced the death on social media.
The announcement did not specify when or where he died or the cause of the death, beyond saying that he died “after a long illness.”
