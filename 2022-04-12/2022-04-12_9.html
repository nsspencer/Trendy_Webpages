     UK PM Johnson and Finance Minister Sunak fined for Covid lockdown breaches
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON — U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Finance Minister Rishi Sunak were fined by police on Tuesday for breaching Covid-19 lockdown rules, reigniting calls for the embattled ministers to resign.
The announcement means Johnson will become the first sitting prime minister in living memory to have been found breaking the law.
Johnson later apologized in a statement and said he had paid the fine in full.
Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, echoed this sentiment, while Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said he did not see how Johnson could continue.
Carrie Johnson, the prime minister's wife, has also been notified that she is to receive a fine for Covid lockdown breaches, her spokesperson said, according to Sky News.

     Boris Johnson to be fined by U.K. police over Covid lockdown parties
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will receive a police fine for breaching his own Covid-19 lockdown rules, Johnson's office said Tuesday.
The news marks the latest dramatic twist in the "partygate" scandal that has gripped the U.K. and led to demands for Johnson to resign.
“The Prime Minister (Boris Johnson) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Rishi Sunak) have today received notification that the Metropolitan Police intend to issue them with fixed penalty notices.
The reports of unauthorized lockdown parties dominated headlines in the British press for weeks, but had faded from public view after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Some people have been fined several thousand pounds and appeared in court for organizing or attending parties while the government's severe restrictions were in place.

     Boris Johnson defies calls to quit after he and Rishi Sunak fined
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boris Johnson has been fined for breaking his own Covid laws by attending a party for his birthday in No 10, but he has vowed to fight on as prime minister in defiance of furious calls for him to quit.
Johnson and Sunak are thought to be the first sitting prime minister and chancellor to be criminally sanctioned.
However, Sunak made no immediate statement in public, leading some Tory MPs to speculate he could resign following a disastrous week in which his wife’s tax affairs have come under scrutiny.
Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, also called for the prime minister to quit.
If that does not materialise, the prime minister could face a further moment of danger when the Sue Gray report containing details of how the parties unfolded is published, after the police investigation ends.

     Boris Johnson fined by police over lockdown-breaking parties at UK government premises
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: London (CNN) Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his finance minister Rishi Sunak have been issued with fines by police over lockdown-breaking parties held on UK government premises, a Downing Street spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday.
Revelations that the Prime Minister attended several parties had already prompted furious calls for him to resign even before Tuesday's announcement of a police fine.
The Prime Minister initially rebuffed allegations of illegal gatherings by saying there were no parties.
The campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK called on Johnson and Sunak to resign, describing their behavior as "truly shameles."
Many said their last goodbyes to loved ones on the phone while the Prime Minister partied," Khan added in a statement on Facebook.
