     Bodybuilder Cedric McMillan Dead At 44, 2017 Arnold Classic Winner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bodybuilding star Cedric McMillan -- winner of the 2017 Arnold Classic -- has sadly died at the age of 44 years old, according to reports.
However, despite often being laid up and unable to keep on mass, the bodybuilder was optimistic he'd soon return to the stage.
Once Cedric got sick with coronavirus and was forced out of competition, he started to provide commentary at bodybuilding events.
CM recently updated fans on his ailing health ... and pondered whether he'd ever be able to return to the stage.
Cedric is the third major bodybuilder to pass away in the last few months.
