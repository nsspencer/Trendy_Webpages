     Rihanna’s Pastel Pink Bralette Shows She’s Ready for Spring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rihanna is in the final stages of pregnancy, and her maternity wardrobe has gone in a slightly comfier—but no less chic—direction.
The singer has been reaching for bralettes and button-down blouses that are not at all restrictive, and still let her bump do the talking.
This week in L.A, Rih sported a pale pink, distressed pair of the low-rise baggy Vetements jeans she’s relied on throughout her pregnancy.
Paired with a terry towel bralette from Bottega Veneta, a statement necklace, and a casual workwear jacket from R13, it made for a sweet spring look.
