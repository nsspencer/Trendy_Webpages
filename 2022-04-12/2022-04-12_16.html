     Ukraine probes claim poisonous substance dropped in Mariupol
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ukraine investigated a claim that a poisonous substance was dropped on besieged Mariupol, as Western officials warned Tuesday that any use of chemical weapons by Russia would be a serious escalation of the already devastating war.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday night that Russian forces could use chemical weapons in the city, echoing similar, repeated warnings by Western officials.
And leaders inside and outside of the country said they were urgently investigating the unconfirmed claim by a Ukrainian regiment that a poisonous substance was dropped on fighters in Mariupol.
Still, there are fears of even wider carnage to come, amid signs the Russian military is gearing up for a major offensive in the Donbas.
The assertion by the Azov Regiment, a far-right group now part of the Ukrainian military, could not be independently verified.

     Biden says Russia is committing 'genocide'; Putin says peace talks at 'dead end': Live Ukraine updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russia's audacious invasion of Ukraine is proceeding as planned and peace talks have reached a "dead end," Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday.
During a stop in Iowa later Tuesday, President Joe Biden said Russia's actions during its invasion of Ukraine amount to ''genocide.''
The focus of the Russian invasion, which began Feb. 24, has moved into eastern and southern Ukraine, the official said.
He also said that by invading Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin “precipitated everything he sought to prevent” as Ukraine's interest in joining NATO has only grown.
Lithuania became the first European country to entirely cut itself off from Russian gas imports in early April.

     Summary: @V_Zelenskiy_official via Telegram A leading pro-Russian politician in Ukraine was shown in fatigues and handcuffs in a photo Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted Tuesday on Telegram.

NBC's Al Roker asked the former president if the Russian president is the same Putin he dealt with during his two terms in the White House.
Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of blocking attempted humanitarian convoys and hampering efforts to evacuate residents.
