     WNBA working to bring Brittney Griner home from ‘unimaginable situation’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moments before Rhyne Howard went to Atlanta with the No 1 pick in the WNBA draft, Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the league is working hard to help bring Brittney Griner back to the United States.
Griner, one of the league’s biggest stars, has been detained in Russia since arriving at a Moscow airport in mid-February.
“I want to take a moment to reiterate the WNBA’s support for Phoenix Mercury star Brittney Griner,” Engelbert said before the draft started.
“This is an unimaginable situation for BG to be in,” Engelbert said.
Certainly, we’re trying everything we can, every angle, working with her legal representation, her agent, elected leaders, the administration.
