Well, let’s see.
On Tuesday at 4:12 p.m. local time, when the game began and the fun ended, fans could have gone home and, to approximate the in-game experience, whacked their temples with ballpeen hammers.

     Summary: Nick Lodolo will take the mound this afternoon – as long as the weather allows it (and it’s not looking great) – making his Major League debut against the Cleveland Guardians.
Update: The game is set to being at 1:15pm – apparently the 2pm earliest start from earlier was incorrect.
Of the 12 hits he allowed to left-handed hitters last season only one went for extra-bases.
Nick Lodolo added to the 40-man and 28-man roster.
By Opening Day, the Reds had lost five wins in Doolittle’s projections — and the A’s had lost 10.
