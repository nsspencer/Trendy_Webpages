     WNBA working to bring Brittney Griner home from ‘unimaginable situation’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moments before Rhyne Howard went to Atlanta with the No 1 pick in the WNBA draft, Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the league is working hard to help bring Brittney Griner back to the United States.
Griner, one of the league’s biggest stars, has been detained in Russia since arriving at a Moscow airport in mid-February.
“I want to take a moment to reiterate the WNBA’s support for Phoenix Mercury star Brittney Griner,” Engelbert said before the draft started.
“This is an unimaginable situation for BG to be in,” Engelbert said.
Certainly, we’re trying everything we can, every angle, working with her legal representation, her agent, elected leaders, the administration.

     WNBA Commish Says Brittney Griner Situation 'Unimaginable,' Fighting To Bring Her Home
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 'We Want To Get Her Home'Play video content Courtesy of WNBAWNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said Monday she and the league are still fighting like hell to bring Brittney Griner back from Russia ... telling reporters the situation is "unimaginable."
Engelbert wasted no time addressing Griner's Russian detainment in her opening remarks prior to the WNBA Draft -- but said little has changed with the basketball superstar's status.
She added that she and players across the league are still following officials' advice to stay relatively mum on the topic.

"This is an unimaginable situation for BG to be in," Engelbert said.

     WNBA Players Association president says Brittney Griner is detained in Russia 'because of a gender issue'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As seven-time WNBA All-Star Brittney Griner enters her 54th day in Russian custody, the WNBA Players Association has a new message amid concerns over her safety and mental health.
Nneka Ogwumike, President of the WNBA Players Association, joined "Good Morning America" Tuesday to shine a new light on Griner's detainment and explain the overall mood among her fellow WNBA players.
Griner had vape cartridges containing hashish oil -- an offense punishable in Russia by up to 10 years in prison -- according to Russian state media.
Ogwumike said she believes there is a gender issue at play in Griner's case.
It's disappointing that the question of it being a gender issue is top of mind now when it comes to this type of circumstance and the reality is she's over there because of a gender issue, pay inequity," she said.

     Gissou Nia: Is Brittney Griner a Russian hostage?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, right now U.S. citizens are more often taken hostage by foreign governments than by nonstate actors.
Sadly, it seems that the detention of WNBA champ Brittney Griner by Russian authorities may be part of that trend.
And Griner was purportedly denied consular access — a basic right of any foreign national in detention — until March 23.
Rather, foreign states that take hostages are violating their international obligations under human rights conventions like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which many hostage-taking states, including Russia, are parties to.
Brittney Griner is in Russian detention and may be there for geopolitical gains wholly unrelated to any of her actions.

     WNBA concerned over Brittney Griner situation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WNBA officials are growing concerned for Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner, who has been held captive nearly two months in Russia and faces up to 10 years in prison.
“This is an unimaginable situation for BG to be in,” WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said.
Russian media reported Griner would be detained until at least May 19, which is two weeks into the WNBA regular season.
Griner is one of approximately 70 WNBA players who use the offseason to play for an international team.
Engelbert said the Mercury and WNBA officials are in constant contact with the United States government and Griner’s legal representation.
