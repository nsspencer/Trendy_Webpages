     Real Madrid Ousts Chelsea by Turning a Collapse Into a Classic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MADRID — The noise rose and swelled with every second that ticked, changing timbre and tone as it did so.
It started with whistles, desperate and urgent, only to turn into something closer to a roar, formless and elemental, filled with angst and anticipation, as if the sound itself could ward off any more suffering.
By the time the final whistle blew, it was so loud that it seemed to be bubbling up from the ground or rumbling down from the sky.
Somehow, though, that proved to be the prelude: The release was still to come, as Real Madrid’s and Chelsea’s players collapsed to the turf, the victors on the day defeated and the beaten triumphant over two legs, and the Bernabeu crackled and shook.
This is not the first time a Champions League game has ended like this, of course: The spectacular comeback and the breathtaking twist now rank as this competition’s calling card, a feature so regular that it is remarkable, in a way, that every time it happens it somehow retains its capacity to surprise.

     Karim Benzema’s Extra-Time Winner Sends Real Madrid to UCL Semis After Chelsea Comeback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After Benzema’s 25-minute hat trick at Stamford Bridge seemed to bury the defending European champion with a 3–1 aggregate, Chelsea made sure to bring some away fireworks of its own by forcing extra time.
But in the 96th minute, Benzema added to his legend with the match-winner in an epic Champions League tie that will go down in history.
The gravity of Alonso’s goal appeared to wake Real Madrid from its slumber.
In the 66th minute, Benzema nearly notched his fourth goal of the tie when his header glanced off the crossbar.
In the semifinals, Real Madrid will face the winner of the Manchester City vs. Atlético Madrid tie with City coming into its second leg away match with a 1–0 lead.

     Real Madrid reaches semifinals after surviving Chelsea comeback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Real Madrid got the better of yet another special night in the UEFA Champions League as it survived a brilliant comeback from Chelsea in a thrilling quarterfinal at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on Tuesday.
The midfielder executed a perfect pass with the outside of his boot, allowing Rodrygo to volley home from close range.
Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Europe/Getty ImagesAfter looking lackluster in the first-leg, Chelsea was much improved for its trip to Spain and came so close to a memorable win.
‘There are no regrets’The three goals had temporarily silenced the home support and Madrid was struggling to lay a glove on the Premier League outfit.
Even in extra-time, with Madrid hanging on, Chelsea went close a number of times but failed to find the all important goal that would have seen it force a penalty shootout.
