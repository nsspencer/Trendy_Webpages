     Lt. Gov. Benjamin Resigns Following Campaign Finance Indictment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ms. Hochul can select a new lieutenant governor in the coming weeks, but it will be far more difficult to replace Mr. Benjamin on the Democratic primary ballot in June.
Mr. Benjamin said last week that he had been cooperating with investigators, after news outlets, including The New York Times, reported details of the investigation.
Prosecutors said Mr. Benjamin had first approached Mr. Migdol for help in March 2019, months before announcing a campaign for comptroller.
“Let me see what I can do,” Mr. Benjamin replied, according to the indictment.
In the months that followed, prosecutors said, Mr. Benjamin used his State Senate office to secure a $50,000 taxpayer-funded education grant for the charity that Mr. Migdol never requested, and used it as leverage to press Mr. Migdol to gather contributions.

     NY Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin resigns after his arrest over allegations of bribery, fraud | WSKG
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brian Benjamin has resigned after being arraigned Tuesday in federal district court on bribery and conspiracy charges in connection with an alleged scheme involving phony campaign donations, when Benjamin ran for New York City comptroller.
Diana Reyna, a former New York City Council member, is the running mate of Long Island Rep. Tom Suozzi.
Ana Maria Archila is seeking the post alongside New York City Public Advocate and gubernatorial candidate Jumaane Williams.
Republicans in the New York State Legislature, where they are the minority party, also condemned Benjamin’s arrest.
Senate GOP Leader Robert Ortt, in a statement, called it “another stain on New York State Government” and said it “calls into question Hochul’s judgment” for choosing Benjamin in the first place.

More recently, reports came out saying subpoenas had been issued to Benjamin regarding the financial issues even before Hochul picked him as lieutenant governor.

"This is a simple story of corruption," Williams said, adding later, "Taxpayer money for campaign contributions.
A Benjamin campaign spokesperson previously told CNN, "Neither Lieutenant Governor Benjamin nor his campaign are being accused of any wrongdoing and they are prepared to fully cooperate with authorities.
"In doing so, Benjamin abused his authority as a New York State senator, engaging in a bribery scheme using public funds for his own corrupt purposes," the indictment states.
Prosecutors claim Benjamin called the real estate developer two hours after he submitted the questionnaire, for the first time in six months.
