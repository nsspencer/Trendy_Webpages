     The Milwaukee Bucks have caught fire from three, and it’s paying off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After 38 games, they sat 23rd in the NBA in 3-point percentage at just 34 percent.
The Milwaukee Bucks have caught fire from three, and it’s paying offWith Giannis missing some time in January, the Bucks have had to rely even more on 3-point shooting than usual, and they have been incredibly good and consistent from outside over the last 12 games.
For 12 straight games, the Bucks have made at least 13 threes and shot at least 35 percent from downtown.
Milwaukee shot over 38 percent from three in just 12 of their first 38 games, but since then have done so in 10 of their last 12 games.
The bottom line is that it’s good to know that the Bucks still are who we thought they were.
