“This is probably one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to share with my loyal fans,” Osbourne says.
In fact, one could argue that Ozzy Osbourne has long been the ‘poster boy’ for the metal genre ever since its foundation.
That being said, it’s not much of a surprise to see Ozzy Osbourne retire at this stage in his career.
However, it should be noted that Osbourne returning to the stage is not completely out of the question as he’s said in his statement.

     Ozzy Osbourne was the wild man of metal on stage – but vulnerability was his secret weapon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How did Ozzy Osbourne stick it out this long?
And would you really bet on his retirement from live performance being permanent, given the vicissitudes he has already weathered?
It could seem like watching a body-swap comedy, in which a builder from Birmingham had been transplanted into the body of a rock star right as a show began and was trying to put on a rock star pose.
Vulnerability made Ozzy seem human, which is a hugely unusual thing for any heavy rock star to project.
It’s like he’s some kind of father-figure or maybe respected older brother to them.”Ageing gracefully was never likely to be the fate of Ozzy Osbourne.
