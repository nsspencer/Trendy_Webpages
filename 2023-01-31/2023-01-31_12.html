     Summary: LAKELAND, Fla. (WFLA) — Lakeland residents are in shock and calling for an end to violence after 11 people were injured in a shooting in broad daylight Monday.
Residents say a school bus had dropped off children near the intersection just moments before the shooting.
The shooting happened just feet away from Smith’s home and she was able to provide police with security camera video.
The video shows her daughter arrive home from school less than a minute before the barrage of bullets rang out.
“We are actively pursuing those leads right now.”Taylor confirmed that a dark-colored Nissan sedan that may be linked to shooting was recovered in West Lakeland, but didn’t say exactly where.
