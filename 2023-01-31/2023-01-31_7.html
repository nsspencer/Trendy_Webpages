     James Gunn unveils DC's new film and TV plan, including fresh spins on Supergirl, Batman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a taped video posted to social media, Gunn outlined nearly a dozen projects that will be part of the DCEU's first new chapter, dubbed "Gods and Monsters."
"So as many of you know, DC has been disconnected in film and television for a long time," Gunn said in a video posted on Twitter.
"And it's one of our jobs, mine and Peter's, to come in and make sure the DCU is connected in film, television, gaming, and animation that the characters are consistent, played by the same actors and it works within one story."
This includes "The Batman – Part II," a follow up film to Matt Reeves' "The Batman."
Here is what is coming as part of the next wave of DCEU projects.

     James Gunn Unveils His New DCU Slate With Reboots of Superman, Batman, Green Lantern and More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After months of anticipation and much speculation, new DC Film heads James Gunn and Peter Safran held a press conference to unveil the first slate of projects in their new, unified vision.
Chapter One of the DCU will be called “Gods and Monsters,” consisting of five movies and five television series that will interconnect between 2025 and 2027.
Nevertheless, that sampling remains deeply ambitious with new Superman and Batman movies, another bite at the Green Lantern apple, a Wonder Woman prequel series, and much more.
It seemed reasonable to assume that after the last four movies leftover in the DCEU slate set to release this year—Shazam!
There’s no reason why any of the characters or the actors that play in those characters are not part of the DCU.
