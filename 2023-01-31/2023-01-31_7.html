     DBR Bites #7 - Let’s Talk About Duke’s 2023 Football Schedule!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2023 Duke Football schedule was released last night, and Sam and Donald jump on early in the morning to discuss what it looks like on DBR Bites Episode 7.
Duke’s got a pretty loaded schedule this year, with nine opponents on the schedule having played in bowl games last season.
It starts with a Labor Day matchup against Clemson, and the schedule doesn’t get any easier from there.
Sam and Donald discuss the ins and outs of this schedule and make their early picks for most important game of the season.
We’ll be back tomorrow after the Wake Forest game to recap that.

     Three Duke basketball products among top 12 NBA rookies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Duke basketball great Paolo Banchero, last summer's No.
Banchero tallied a team-high 29 points, and his nine rebounds tied another former Duke basketball forward, Wendell Carter Jr., for the most among Magic players.
In his 44 appearances this season, Banchero is averaging 20.7 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 3.7 assists.
That suggests the 2021-22 ACC Rookie of the Year shouldn't have been the only Duke basketball product to become a 2022 lottery pick.

     Catching Up With Coach K
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now 75, about to turn 76, Coach K is still Coach K. He says he doesn’t miss coaching, but he still takes notes on games.
He’s also inviting fans to donate to the Emily K Center and in turn is inviting them to watch the games with him in his office, which is probably an amazing experience and basketball education.
Here are some excerpts:“I’m not trying to figure out how to attack [Syracuse coach Jim] Boeheim’s zone or somebody’s press or think of the most intricate out-of-bounds play anymore.
Did [you] play hard?” “Don’t attach your ego into what your kid is doing.
That’s a big mistake.”We miss seeing him coach because he was masterful, arguably the G.O.A.T.

     Duke Downs Deacs In Cameron, 75-73
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Blue Devils did get some separation when Jeremy Roach hit a layup with 2:06 to go in the first to put Duke up 38-32.
Ryan Young converted a three-point play with 1:44 left to give Duke a 41-34 lead that they took into halftime.
The Blue Devils built a 12 point lead at 46-34 and got it as high as 51-38 with 13:16 to go.
In the first half against Wake, Roach racked up 17 points and finished with 21.
For all the criticisms of Duke, as we keep pointing out, this is a very young team - and it is improving.
