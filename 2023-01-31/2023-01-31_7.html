     Derek Carr makes it a clean sweep of Pro Bowl replacement QBs in AFC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesDerek Carr did not end the 2022 season as a starting quarterback, but he’s still a Pro Bowler.
Carr announced on Tuesday that he will be taking part in this year’s Pro Bowl festivities.
He’s the third replacement quarterback on the AFC side as Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence and Ravens quarterback Tyler Huntley have already been announced as replacements.
Carr was benched by the Raiders for the final games of the regular season and he’s already said farewell to the team, but the Pro Bowl nod means he’ll have one more appearance at Allegiant Stadium.
If Carr does feel that way, it would make sense to give a call to Rob Lowe’s football stylist to see if they can work their magic once again.

     Raiders QB Derek Carr added to Pro Bowl roster as AFC digs deep into alternates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A month ago it appeared Derek Carr had represented the Raiders for the last time.
And we’re two weeks from the deadline for the team to cut him or find a trade partner.
And now he’s been named to the Pro Bowl in Las Vegas.
Well, despite playing his worst season after not making the Pro Bowl since 2017 and being benched with two games left in the season, the AFC basically needed a warm body to fill out the roster.
So, the QB trio at the Pro Bowl will be Trevor Lawrence, Carr, and Huntley.

     Derek Carr Has Hilarious Reaction to Surprise Pro Bowl News
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Raiders quarterback Derek Carr is headed back to the Pro Bowl for the fourth time in his career after he was named as an AFC replacement for the inaugural Pro Bowl Games on Tuesday.
“Well… maybe this invitation got lost in the mail from past seasons but I’m going back to pro bowl #4,” Carr quipped in his tweet.
Carr issued a written farewell to Raider Nation earlier in the month in which he spoke favorably about his time with the franchise.
Now he’ll have a chance to bid goodbye to the team’s fan base one last time at home before he’s moved elsewhere.
The Pro Bowl Games will take place throughout the end of this week, culminating in a flag football game on Sunday, Feb. 5.

     Benched Raiders QB Derek Carr makes 2023 Pro Bowl as alternate: 'See you soon, Vegas'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Super Bowl LVII officially set, the NFL is in the process of finalizing their Pro Bowl replacements for the members of the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs, who will be unable to compete in Las Vegas this weekend.
In fact, all three AFC quarterbacks initially chosen for the 2023 Pro Bowl will not be in attendance, so the NFL had to bring in three new signal-callers.
One of the more interesting replacements is Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr.
Earlier this month, Carr posted his official goodbye to the Raiders franchise on Twitter, and also announced his plans on continuing his pursuit of a Lombardi Trophy.
It appears Burrow bowed out as well, so the AFC Pro Bowl quarterbacks will be Trevor Lawrence, Carr and Tyler Huntley.

     Summary: HENDERSON, Nev. – Las Vegas Raiders QB Derek Carr has been named to the 2023 Pro Bowl Games, the NFL and Raiders announced Tuesday.
Carr, who will be appearing in his fourth Pro Bowl, is replacing Bengals QB Joe Burrow.

This marks the 26th time in franchise history that five or more Raiders players have been named to the Pro Bowl.

     Summary: The Raiders benched Carr for the final weeks of the regular season, and he's already said his farewell to his only NFL club.
But he's currently still under contract in Vegas, with $40.4 million in compensation becoming fully guaranteed by Feb. 15.
The Raiders could work out a trade of Carr before that date, cut him, or squat on his rights, hoping a deal materializes later, similar to Baker Mayfield and the Browns last season.
