     Ancient ‘green comet’ discovered by Palomar Observatory visible for 3 nights in San Diego County
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The “green comet”, which has gotten a lot of publicity since its discovery last year from the Palomar Observatory in North County, will be visible late Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights from areas that are not overwhelmed by city lights, according to UC San Diego astrophysicist Brian Keating.
The roughly half-mile wide comet, which was last visible from Earth during the Stone Age, can be found 30 degrees above the northern horizon, between the Big Dipper and Polaris.
AdvertisementThe comet will be making its closest approach to Earth, coming within roughly 26 million miles of the planet.
The last three letters refer to the Zwicky Transient Facility, which is part of Palomar Observatory.
Scientists determined that the comet last passed relatively close Earth about 50,000 years ago, during the time of the Neanderthals.

     Summary: It’s been a while since we last laid eyes on this rare green comet — about 50,000 years, to be exact.
Comet C/2022 E3, more commonly known as the green comet, was last seen by humans — as well as Neanderthals — during the Stone Age.
However, some in the Northern Hemisphere have already had a sneak peek of the green flash, according to NASA.
And space enthusiasts on social media have already captured some stunning images of the comet’s vibrant green glow.
C/2022 E3, for example, hails from the Oort cloud — a theoretical region of predominantly icy formation at the edge of our solar system.

Distinct green comet approaches Earth | Live updatesThe "#greencomet" isn't some @Marvel or @DCComics superhero.
The path of the Green Comet is taking it over the Northern polar region where it will make its closet approach.
The Green Comet can be located by looking northwest, the path it is following, of the space between the North Star and the cup of the Big Dipper.
For the best stargazing in the night sky you may want to seek out an International Dark Sky Park located around the United States.

Read our privacy notice Thanks for signing up to theIndyTech email {{ #verifyErrors }} {{ message }} {{ /verifyErrors }} {{ ^verifyErrors }} Something went wrong.
Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}A green comet is about to fly past Earth before disappearing from our Solar System, never to be seen again.
At a relatively close 42 million kilometres (26 million miles) from Earth, it offers a rare opportunity for sky gazers to witness a comet.
At its perigee on Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning, the green comet had a brightness value of the magnitude of about +4.7, meaning it was possible to see it with the naked eye.

Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is a "circumpolar" object, meaning that it stays within close range of the pole star as the sky does its nightly revolution.
