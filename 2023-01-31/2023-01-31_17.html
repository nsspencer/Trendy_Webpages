     Summary: Nikki Haley is expected to announce she’s running for president on February 15 in Charleston, according to a person familiar with her plans.
Haley would be the first Republican to jump into the 2024 presidential race this year, facing only former President Donald Trump, who launched his bid last year, as her competition out of the gates.
She’s expected to send an invite to her supporters announcing the special event in the coming days, according to sources familiar with the matter.
A spokesperson for Haley did not immediately provide details about the plans.
“She called me and said she’d like to consider it, and I said, ‘You should do it,’” Trump said in recalling the conversation.

     Summary: News of Haley's announcement was first reported by the Post and Courier newspaper in South Carolina.
Haley’s travels brought her numerous times to Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, which hold the first, second and fourth contests in the Republican presidential nominating calendar.
Haley’s home state of South Carolina votes third in the GOP primary schedule.
When speaking with reporters last year who questioned her about a White House run, Haley reiterated that "after November, we’ll figure it out.
But later that year, Haley signaled an openness to a possible 2024 presidential run even if Trump decided to seek the White House again.

     Summary: Haley, 51, served as South Carolina's governor for six years before serving as President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations.
Trump was in South Carolina Saturday for the initial campaign swing of his 2024 campaign, standing alongside Gov.
During the Trump administration, Haley feuded at times with other White House officials while bolstering her own public persona.
Late last year, during a visit to her alma mater, Haley told an audience at Clemson University that she would be "taking the holidays" to consider a run.
In South Carolina on Saturday, Trump told WIS-TV that Haley had called him several days earlier to seek his opinion.

     Nikki Haley poised to enter 2024 presidential race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Haley’s expected announcement represents a turnabout: Haley declared in 2021 that she wouldn’t run for president if Trump did.
After serving in the South Carolina legislature, Haley won election to the governorship in 2010, after prevailing in a hotly contested primary in which she’d initially been regarded as the underdog.
During the primary, she was bolstered by endorsements from people including former South Carolina First Lady Jenny Sanford and former Alaska Gov.
Haley’s decision to launch her campaign in her native South Carolina highlights how critical the early-voting state is to her prospects — and several other candidates.
Trump won the South Carolina GOP primary in 2016 – a contest in which he prevailed over the Haley-backed candidate, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
