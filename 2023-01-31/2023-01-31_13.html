     Summary: Update: Broncos will likely give first round pick in deal to make Payton head coach Published 5:15 pm Tuesday, January 31, 2023ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — The Denver Broncos have agreed to a deal with the New Orleans Saints that will make Sean Payton their head coach, a person with knowledge of the accord said Tuesday.
Payton remained under contract with New Orleans after stepping down from the Saints last year and working in broadcasting this season.
The Broncos, who went 5-12 in 2022 and extended their playoff drought to seven years, fired rookie coach Nathaniel Hackett on Dec. 26 after he went 4-11.
Payton was the headliner during this year’s cycle of head coach openings.
NFL rules didn’t allow the Broncos to speak with Payton until Jan. 17, more than three weeks after they’d fired Hackett.
