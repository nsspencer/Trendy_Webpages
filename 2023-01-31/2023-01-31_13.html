     Derek Carr Has Hilarious Reaction to Surprise Pro Bowl News
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Raiders quarterback Derek Carr is headed back to the Pro Bowl for the fourth time in his career after he was named as an AFC replacement for the inaugural Pro Bowl Games on Tuesday.
“Well… maybe this invitation got lost in the mail from past seasons but I’m going back to pro bowl #4,” Carr quipped in his tweet.
Carr issued a written farewell to Raider Nation earlier in the month in which he spoke favorably about his time with the franchise.
Now he’ll have a chance to bid goodbye to the team’s fan base one last time at home before he’s moved elsewhere.
The Pro Bowl Games will take place throughout the end of this week, culminating in a flag football game on Sunday, Feb. 5.

     Report: Raiders QB Derek Carr not permitted to seek trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: February 1 - The Las Vegas Raiders have not granted quarterback Derek Carr permission to speak to potential trade partners, multiple outlets reported.
Carr apparently will get that chance this week at the Pro Bowl Games in Las Vegas.
He announced on Tuesday that he had been named as a replacement for the showcase, his fourth Pro Bowl selection.
"Well... maybe this invitation got lost in the mail from past seasons but I'm going back to pro bowl #4," he posted on Twitter.
Carr completed 60.8 percent of his passes for 3,522 yards with 24 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 15 games this season.

     A Derek Carr Pro Bowl (games) injury would put the Raiders in a tough spot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His belated qualification for the Pro Bowl (games) could complicate that strategy.
It’s possible, albeit unlikely, that Carr will suffer an injury during the upcoming Frolf Olympics, which will culminate in a game of flag football.
Twenty-four years ago, running back Robert Edwards suffered a vcry serious injury during a game of beach football held in connection with the Pro Bowl.
If Carr suffers any injury that prevents him from passing a physical before February 15, the Raiders won’t be able to release him and avoid owing him $40.4 million.
“In 2022, Carr started in 15 games and completed 305-of-502 passes for 3,522 yards with 24 touchdowns and a passer rating of 86.3,” the team’s article proclaims, without pointing out why he didn’t start more than 15 games.

     Summary: The Raiders benched Carr for the final weeks of the regular season, and he's already said his farewell to his only NFL club.
But he's currently still under contract in Vegas, with $40.4 million in compensation becoming fully guaranteed by Feb. 15.
The Raiders could work out a trade of Carr before that date, cut him, or squat on his rights, hoping a deal materializes later, similar to Baker Mayfield and the Browns last season.

     Benched Raiders QB Derek Carr makes 2023 Pro Bowl as alternate: 'See you soon, Vegas'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Super Bowl LVII officially set, the NFL is in the process of finalizing their Pro Bowl replacements for the members of the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs, who will be unable to compete in Las Vegas this weekend.
In fact, all three AFC quarterbacks initially chosen for the 2023 Pro Bowl will not be in attendance, so the NFL had to bring in three new signal-callers.
One of the more interesting replacements is Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr.
Earlier this month, Carr posted his official goodbye to the Raiders franchise on Twitter, and also announced his plans on continuing his pursuit of a Lombardi Trophy.
It appears Burrow bowed out as well, so the AFC Pro Bowl quarterbacks will be Trevor Lawrence, Carr and Tyler Huntley.

But, there are a lot of quarterback-needy teams and the will be other franchises that pursue Carr as well.
Let’s look at a team that could be a good fit for Carr and make sense as a trade partner with the Raiders by the February 15 deadline to make a decision based on Carr’s contract — the Carolina Panthers.
Why the Panthers would be interested in Carr:The Panthers have been trying to figure out their quarterback situation for years.
But these reasons all point to the Panthers as being among the potential suitors for the Raiders’ nine-season starter.

     Analyst names best landing spot for Raiders QB Derek Carr
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Las Vegas Raiders will presumably have no shortage of suitors for quarterback Derek Carr with as many as 10 teams potentially looking for a new signal caller heading into 2023.
Fortunately for Carr, his no-trade clause will keep the Raiders from selling him off to the highest bidder, instead allowing both sides to find the best possible fit for the 31-year-old QB.
And according to Bleacher Report’s Brent Sobleski, that best fit is in New Orleans.
“Carr is very much a rhythm passer, who should fit in nicely with Pete Carmichael's offensive scheme,” Sobleski wrote.
He’s thrown 20 or more touchdown passes in eight of his nine seasons, and he’s had a passer rating of 90 or better six times.
