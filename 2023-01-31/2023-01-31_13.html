     Netflix password-sharing crackdown details released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The "Sharing your Netflix account" pages on the streaming giant’s Help Center for Costa Rica, Chile and Peru on Wednesday said "anyone in your household (those who live with you at your primary location)" can use a Netflix account.
Or the owner of the account that outsiders have been using can add them as an "extra member," according to those webpages.
That additional monthly fee will be charged to the person whose account the "extra member" gets added to.
To detect devices linked to the primary location of an account, the company said it utilizes IP addresses, device IDs and account activity.
Those so-called "trusted devices" allow users to stream content on Netflix when not at the primary location.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Based on info sourced from Netflix’s support pages, The Streamable reported on Tuesday details about its upcoming anti-password sharing efforts.
But now Netflix tells The Verge it hasn’t confirmed what its setup could look like for US streaming subscribers.
We already know that Netflix is planning to roll out password sharing more broadly within the coming months.
In its report, The Streamable cites this Netflix help center page as the source for its information.
Similarly, the currently available US support page about what Netflix considers a “household” is vastly different from the pages in Costa Rica, Chile, and Peru.

     How will Netflix end password sharing? Updates for 3 other countries offer insight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How the paid password sharing will be enforced, and how much it will cost, wasn’t released.
Netflix appears to have rolled out new rules on account sharing in these countries, updating its help pages for all three this week.
According to those pages, anyone within the account holder’s home – referred to as their “primary location” – can use that Netflix account.
Netflix’s move to tackle password sharing is a shift from the company’s previous stance.
Instead, he called password sharing “something you have to learn to live with,” CNBC reports.

     Netflix reveals first details of password sharing crackdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix (NFLX) has revealed the first details of its password sharing crackdown.
As a result, Netflix will require users to identify a "primary location" for all accounts that live within the same household.
Netflix warned in the its quarterly letter to shareholders it will be intensifying its push to combat password sharing.
Today’s widespread account sharing (100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as build our business," the company said.
Coupled with a crackdown on password sharing, Netflix will also rely on its newly launched ad-supported tier to lift profitability, especially as competition within the streaming space escalates: "As always, our north stars remain pleasing our members and building even greater profitability over time."
