     Derek Carr Has Hilarious Reaction to Surprise Pro Bowl News
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Raiders quarterback Derek Carr is headed back to the Pro Bowl for the fourth time in his career after he was named as an AFC replacement for the inaugural Pro Bowl Games on Tuesday.
“Well… maybe this invitation got lost in the mail from past seasons but I’m going back to pro bowl #4,” Carr quipped in his tweet.
Carr issued a written farewell to Raider Nation earlier in the month in which he spoke favorably about his time with the franchise.
Now he’ll have a chance to bid goodbye to the team’s fan base one last time at home before he’s moved elsewhere.
The Pro Bowl Games will take place throughout the end of this week, culminating in a flag football game on Sunday, Feb. 5.

     Summary: Plenty of big quarterback names like Aaron Rodgers will be rumored to potentially change teams this offseason.
The first domino to fall this offseason could very well be Raiders quarterback Derek Carr.
However, the Raiders can figure out whether they will be able to trade Carr before that February 15 deadline.
The Raiders have every incentive to figure out whether they actually can trade Carr before that deadline.
If the Raiders cannot trade Carr, they likely will release him.

     Benched Raiders QB Derek Carr makes 2023 Pro Bowl as alternate: 'See you soon, Vegas'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Super Bowl LVII officially set, the NFL is in the process of finalizing their Pro Bowl replacements for the members of the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs, who will be unable to compete in Las Vegas this weekend.
In fact, all three AFC quarterbacks initially chosen for the 2023 Pro Bowl will not be in attendance, so the NFL had to bring in three new signal-callers.
One of the more interesting replacements is Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr.
Earlier this month, Carr posted his official goodbye to the Raiders franchise on Twitter, and also announced his plans on continuing his pursuit of a Lombardi Trophy.
It appears Burrow bowed out as well, so the AFC Pro Bowl quarterbacks will be Trevor Lawrence, Carr and Tyler Huntley.

But he's currently still under contract in Vegas, with $40.4 million in compensation becoming fully guaranteed by Feb. 15.
The Raiders could work out a trade of Carr before that date, cut him, or squat on his rights, hoping a deal materializes later, similar to Baker Mayfield and the Browns last season.

But, there are a lot of quarterback-needy teams and the will be other franchises that pursue Carr as well.
Let’s look at a team that could be a good fit for Carr and make sense as a trade partner with the Raiders by the February 15 deadline to make a decision based on Carr’s contract — the Carolina Panthers.
Why the Panthers would be interested in Carr:The Panthers have been trying to figure out their quarterback situation for years.
But these reasons all point to the Panthers as being among the potential suitors for the Raiders’ nine-season starter.

The team has until February 15 to make a deal before the Derek Carr contract kicks in with a host of future guarantees.
However, because of the Derek Carr contract, we thought the saga would almost be over by early February.
This means the QB can turn down any Derek Carr trade he doesn’t like.
