     Russell Westbrook reacts to passing Gary Payton on assists list
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite his decline in production over the past couple of seasons, Russell Westbrookâ€™s legacy as one of the greatest point guards to ever play in the NBA is secure.
It may have ended in a losing effort, but Westbrook was able to add 10 more assists to his name.
As a result, he is now tenth on the all-time assists list, having surpassed Gary Paytonâ€™s 8,966 career tally with 8,972 dimes of his own.
Russell Westbrook then hammered home that he is extremely grateful for everything; hearing his name mentioned alongside Gary Payton as one of the all-time great point guards doesnâ€™t happen to just anyone.
These days, the discussion surrounding Russell Westbrook among fans and pundits alike mostly revolves around his shooting struggles, playoff viability, and his exorbitant salary relative to current production.

     Summary: Emotions were running a bit high on Tuesday night as the Los Angeles Lakers took on the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
Thereâ€™s always some sort of action whenever the Lakers visit the Garden, and on this particular occasion, it was Russell Westbrook who saw himself getting into it with a fan sitting courtside.
Russ had an intense exchange with millionaire entrepreneur Gary Vee, who himself had a few things to say to Westbrook as well:Russell Westbrook exchanges words with Gary Vee ðŸ‘€pic.twitter.com/R94ghq76aG â€” ClutchPoints (@ClutchPointsApp) February 1, 2023For those who do not know who Gary Vee is (full name: Gary Vaynerchuk), the 47-year-old is a very successful entrepreneur that has quite the following on social media.
As it turns out, Gary Vee had some words for Russ on Tuesday night, and Iâ€™m guessing that it didnâ€™t have anything to do with sound financial advice.
Given that this is Russell Westbrook weâ€™re talking about here, it comes as no surprise at all that the Lakers veteran decided to engage with the celebrity courtside heckler.
