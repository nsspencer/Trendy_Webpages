     Rare, green comet to pass by Earth Wednesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A rare green comet that has been traveling through our solar system for the last month is expected to make its closest pass to Earth between Wednesday and Thursday, according to NASA and astronomers.
During that time, the comet will be 26 million miles away from the planet, according to astronomers.
NASA scientists said the comet made its closest approach to the sun, or perihelion, on Jan. 12.
"The comet is now visible all night long from northern latitudes but will surely fade from easy observation during the next few weeks," NASA wrote on its site Tuesday.
The last time the comet passed by Earth was 50,000 years ago, according to NASA.

     Green comet discovered by Palomar Observatory flies closest to Earth Wednesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday night San Diegans will get their best look at a comet that hasn’t passed this close to earth in 50,000 years.
The comet, which appears green, was discovered by San Diego County’s Palomar Observatory in March 2022.
Cameron Hummels is a research scientist at Caltech, which operates the Palomar Observatory in the mountains east of San Diego.
“Because the comet itself, the icy part of the comet itself, is less than a mile in diameter, it’s a really small guy.
The comet appears green due to its molecular makeup and the way that it is illuminated by the sun.

     How to See the Rare Green Comet That Is Passing By Earth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A rare green comet that last passed through our solar system 50,000 years ago will fly within about 26 million miles of Earth on Wednesday, harmlessly zipping by at a blistering speed.
The sun-orbiting cosmic snowball, made of frozen rock and dust, first enthralled amateur and professional astronomers and photographers alike during its recent journey through the inner solar system.
The comet has become increasingly more visible in the nighttime sky with binoculars and telescopes in the Northern Hemisphere over the past month or so, according to National Aeronautics and Space Administration astronomers.

     ‘Green Comet’ to Pass Close Wednesday and Thursday, But You’ll Need Binoculars

     Summary: The Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF).
Photo by Don Bartlett/NASAThe so-called “green comet” will pass closest to Earth on Wednesday and Thursday, but you’ll probably need binoculars to see it in San Diego.
Officially named Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF), it was discovered by astronomers using the wide-field survey camera at Caltech’s Zwicky Transient Facility on Mount Palomar in March.
That came later after follow-up observations by many telescopes worldwide.”It’s dim, but you can see it in binoculars or a small telescope.
But with just binoculars or a small telescope, you probably won’t see green — only white.

Distinct green comet approaches Earth | Live updatesThe "#greencomet" isn't some @Marvel or @DCComics superhero.
The path of the Green Comet is taking it over the Northern polar region where it will make its closet approach.
The Green Comet can be located by looking northwest, the path it is following, of the space between the North Star and the cup of the Big Dipper.
For the best stargazing in the night sky you may want to seek out an International Dark Sky Park located around the United States.

Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is a "circumpolar" object, meaning that it stays within close range of the pole star as the sky does its nightly revolution.
And because C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is a popular object, the experts are constantly updating its whereabouts via computer.
