     R. Kelly sex abuses charges dropped at Chicago prosecutor's request
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A judge has formally dismissed sex abuse charges against disgraced R&amp;B star R. Kelly at the request of a Chicago prosecutor, who said Monday that "justice has been served" since Kelly's convictions in federal court cases in 2021 and 2022 have all but ensured he'll be behind bars for decades to come.

He is also set to be sentenced next month in Chicago federal court after being found guilty on child pornography and child enticement charges this past September.
Allegations of sexual misconduct have long shadowed Kelly, but it wasn't until the rise of the #MeToo movement and the release of the Lifetime docuseries Surviving R. Kelly that public pressure really began to mount for authorities to take action.
The Cook County indictment was announced in 2019, before the federal cases in New York and Chicago.

     R. Kelly sex abuse charges dropped in Chicago, as he may ‘never’ leave prison

     Summary: Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx announced on Jan. 30 that R. Kelly's sex abuse charges would be dropped, a day ahead of his court hearing in Chicago.
Choose your plan ArrowRight Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said she will ask a judge on Tuesday to dismiss charges of aggravated criminal sexual assault and aggravated criminal sexual abuse that her office filed against Kelly in 2019.
Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was convicted of sex trafficking and racketeering by a New York federal court in 2021, and later sentenced to 30 years in prison.
Kelly is potentially looking at … never walking out of prison again for the crimes that he’s committed,” Foxx said at a news conference.
The Cook County State’s Attorney Office filed its indictment against Kelly in 2019, after the release of the Lifetime documentary “Surviving R. Kelly,” which featured several of his accusers.

    </h2>

     Summary: Instead the state’s attorney decided to dismiss the charges four years after they were filed against the singer.
Still, Foxx acknowledged her office had heard from at least one alleged victim who did not agree with the decision.
“I understand how hard it was for these victims to come forward and tell their stories,” Foxx wrote in a statement Tuesday.
Carter came forward again in 2019 after the “Surviving R. Kelly” documentary reignited public interest in the case.
“That is really our next battle,” Bonjean told reporters, joined by several Kelly supporters who attended the hearing.

     Chicago prosecutor dropping R. Kelly sex-abuse charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CHICAGO (AP) — A Chicago prosecutor said Monday that she’s dropping sex-abuse charges against singer R. Kelly following federal convictions in two courts that should guarantee the disgraced R&amp;B star will be locked up for decades.
Kelly is potentially looking at the possibility of never walking out of prison again for the crimes that he’s committed,” the prosecutor said, referring to his federal convictions.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is serving a 30-year prison sentence in the New York case and awaits sentencing on Feb. 23 in Chicago federal court.
Lanita Carter, who said she was sexually assaulted by R. Kelly in February 2003, said she was “extremely disappointed” with the news.
Widespread outrage over Kelly’s sexual misconduct didn’t emerge until the #MeToo reckoning and the release of the Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” in early 2019.
