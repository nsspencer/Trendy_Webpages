     Arsenal confirm £12m Jorginho signing after accepting defeat on Caicedo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal have signed the Chelsea midfielder Jorginho for £12m after accepting they could not convince Brighton to sell Moisés Caicedo.
“I was a bit surprised, but I took the opportunity of this amazing challenge,” Jorginho said.
Arsenal, who have given Jorginho an 18-month deal with the option of an extra year, hope that signing someone of the 31-year-old’s experience will boost their title push.
Chelsea remain interested in Caicedo, but Brighton, who have sold Leandro Trossard to Arsenal two weeks ago, are determined to keep the 21-year-old.
Chelsea cannot do that because of financial fair play rules and want Benfica to accept a different payment structure.
