     Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson: A Timeline of Their Rocky Romance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson tied the knot after being together for just four days — and their relationship was anything but a breeze.
Only 96 hours into their getaway, they got married, but their carefree romance quickly soured when they returned to California.
Anderson and Lee filed a $10 million lawsuit to attempt to prevent the tape from being published, but the suit was eventually dropped.
“I couldn't understand why Pamela had followed through with pressing charges," Lee wrote in his band’s 2001 memoir, The Dirt.
Lee, for his part, was married to Elaine Starchuk from 1984 to 1985 and Heather Locklear from 1986 to 1993.

     Summary: Photo: Francois Guillot/AFP via Getty ImagesThe bullet points that make up Pamela Anderson’s life are a matter of public record.
“I didn’t think I’d want to spend this part of my life explaining myself to people,” she writes in her new memoir, Love, Pamela.
The memoir, alongside her Netflix documentary Pamela, a Love Story, is more like an addendum to the facts already in the public consciousness.
She faced abuse before Hollywood“At a young age, I learned that people are mostly awful,” Anderson writes early on, after a description of her humble childhood in Ladysmith, a small town on Vancouver Island.
“She said she’d spoken to Julian about me, and she knew I deserved a lot more respect than people gave me, especially in the media,” Anderson writes.
