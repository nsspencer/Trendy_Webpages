     Could Joe Lombardi join Sean Payton with the Denver Broncos?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With news breaking that the Denver Broncos have reached a deal to hire Sean Payton, we know the Broncos got this year’s top head coach candidate albeit at a cost.
Now how will Sean Payton’s staff come together?
I said “most” of his old cronies were employed and recently dismissed, but namely, Joe Lombardi and Sean Payton go way back and he’d be my front-runner at this point for a prominent offensive assistant position.
Klint Kubiak could also possibly be retained with his long-standing Broncos ties, but Payton may want his own guy.
Any of the above stated combos are a breath of fresh air to me the Denver Broncos need a turnaround to a winning football mentality and here is to hoping Sean Payton can spearhead that movement.
