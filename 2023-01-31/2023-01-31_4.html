     Stranded humpback whale in New York is latest to die along East Coast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LIDO BEACH, N.Y. — A 35-foot humpback whale washed ashore and later died on a New York beach, one of several cetaceans discovered over the past two months along the shores of New York and New Jersey.
The whale was discovered Monday morning at Lido Beach West Town Park on Long Island.
Officials said it was still alive when found but died a short time later, according to news outlets.
Researchers hope to perform a necropsy to better understand what might have caused the whale to beach itself.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is responsible for the nation’s oceans and fisheries, said 19 humpback whales were stranded last year along the U.S. Atlantic coast.

     Massive humpback whale washes ashore in New York amid ‘unusual’ spate of deaths: ‘Happening a little too often’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The large humpback washed ashore on Lido Beach, on Long Island, around 6 a.m., officials said.
The humpback whale has no visible signs of injury, but investigators are hoping a necropsy will lead them to a cause of death.
Bulldozers and diggers were brought in to drag the whale to higher ground so it could be preserved for examination.
“It’s sad, but we couldn’t miss the opportunity to see a beached whale,” bystander Kate Magee told Nexstar’s WPIX.
While officials look for a cause of death, NOAA Fisheries said the investigation comes amid a spate of unusual elevated humpback whale deaths along the Atlantic coast since 2016, during which at least 180 humpback mortalities were observed between Maine and Florida.

     35-Ft. Humpback Whale Washes Up on New York Beach: 'This Is a Sad Day'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 35-foot-long humpback whale washed up on Lido Beach in New York on Sunday night and was found dead by rescue crews Monday morning.
JUSTIN LANE/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockMarine biologists conducted the necropsy and will use the information gathered from the procedure to determine the humpback whale's cause of death.
After the necropsy, the animal was buried at the beach, per SWNS.
"Sad to see this beautiful mammal and imagine the pain it went through until it washed ashore," Lido Beach local Nick Perrotta told the outlet about the whale.
According to WABC, one of the whales died due to a vessel strike, but the cause of death for many of the remaining whales is still unknown.

     Federal authorities: Humpback whale that washed ashore on Long Island was tracked for 4 decades

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Learning more about whale that washed up on Lido BeachLearning more about whale that washed up on Lido BeachLearning more about whale that washed up on Lido BeachLIDO BEACH, N.Y. -- Federal authorities are examining a humpback whale that was found dead on a beach in Nassau County, trying to determine how it died.
Since late last year, several whales have washed ashore in New York and New Jersey.
Perhaps most interestingly, his name is Luna, he's 41 feet long, weighs 29,000 pounds, and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration had been tracking him for four decades.
Luna washed ashore Monday morning and created quite the spectacle on the sand as onlookers took pictures to memorialize the encounter.
More shots got snapped Tuesday of what some said was a once-in-a lifetime experience to see a whale this close.
