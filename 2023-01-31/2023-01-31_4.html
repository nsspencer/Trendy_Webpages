     Sean Payton Lands in Denver
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Broncos are trading their 2023 first-round pick and next year's third-round pick to the New Orleans Saints for head coach Sean Payton, according to Adam Schefter of ESPN.
Momentum for Payton to land a job appeared to have slowed down last week as Carolina hired Frank Reich and Arizona and Houston, the other two organizations he interviewed with, looked to go in a different direction.
The expectation was to win right away and Hackett's offense never turned the corner to help out a strong defensive unit.
The Panthers met with and interviewed Payton in New York over a week ago before deciding to hire Reich as the sixth head coach in franchise history.
