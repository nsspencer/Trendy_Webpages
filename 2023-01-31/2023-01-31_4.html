     Arsenal close to £12m Jorginho deal after accepting defeat on Caicedo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal are close to completing a £12m deal to sign the Chelsea midfielder Jorginho after accepting they will not convince Brighton to sell Moisés Caicedo.
Chelsea, who are still negotiating with Benfica over a deal for Enzo Fernández, will receive money for a player who could leave for free in the summer.
Arsenal, who have offered Jorginho an 18-month deal with the option of an extra year, will hope that signing a player of the 31-year-old’s experience will boost their title push.
Arsenal had placed much of their focus on trying to buy Caicedo but had their latest offer of £70m for the Ecuador midfielder turned away.
Chelsea remain interested in Caicedo, but Brighton, who have sold Leandro Trossard to Arsenal two weeks ago, are determined to keep the 21-year-old.
