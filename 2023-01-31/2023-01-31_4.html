     Arsenal sign midfielder Jorginho from Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 31 (Reuters) - Premier League leaders Arsenal have signed experienced Italian midfielder Jorginho from London rivals Chelsea on an 18-month contract, the club said on Tuesday.
"Jorginho is a midfield player with intelligence, deep leadership skills and a huge amount of Premier League and international experience," Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta told the club's website.
Brazilian-born Jorginho will provide Arsenal with significant experience in their title charge, having won the Champions League with Chelsea and the 2020 European Championship with Italy.
The 31-year-old has been a key player for Chelsea this season, featuring 25 times in all competitions.
Arsenal made a late bid for Jorginho after they reportedly had two offers for Ecuador midfielder Moises Caicedo rejected by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.

     Transfer Deadline Day: Arsenal sign Jorginho from Chelsea; do Gunners have the depth to win Premier League?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Set aside young center back Jakub Kiwior and the two additions they have brought in are a 28-year-old forward in Leandro Trossard and Jorginho, the 31-year-old Champions League winner from Chelsea.
Neither of these two additions can be certain to be starters, but what they do add is Premier League experience to the club's depth chart, which is examined in detail below.
Arsenal's average positions in Premier League games Twenty3Early in this season, their first XI was humming and had reached the level that is so often a sign of champions.
Most pressing of all is central midfield, where Albert Sambi Lokonga left on deadline day for Crystal Palace on a loan with no option to buy.
The reality is that few teams end up Premier League champions because they managed to ride an injury wave effectively.
