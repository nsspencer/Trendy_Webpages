     R. Kelly sex abuse charges dropped in Chicago as he may ‘never’ leave prison
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx announced on Jan. 30 that R. Kelly's sex abuse charges would be dropped, a day ahead of his court hearing in Chicago.
Choose your plan ArrowRight Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said she will ask a judge on Tuesday to dismiss charges of aggravated criminal sexual assault and aggravated criminal sexual abuse that her office filed against Kelly in 2019.
Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was convicted of sex trafficking and racketeering by a New York federal court in 2021, and later sentenced to 30 years in prison.
Kelly is potentially looking at … never walking out of prison again for the crimes that he’s committed,” Foxx said at a news conference.
The Cook County State’s Attorney Office filed its indictment against Kelly in 2019, after the release of the Lifetime documentary “Surviving R. Kelly,” which featured several of his accusers.

     Chicago Prosecutors to Drop Sex-Abuse Charges Against R. Kelly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: R. Kelly Photo: E. Jason Wambsgans/AFP via Getty ImagesR. Kelly is set to have charges accusing him of sexually abusing four people, three of whom were minors, dropped by Chicago prosecutors.
A judge will decide on the indictments January 31 after multiple federal convictions ensure the singer will remain behind bars for decades.
“I have spent nearly 20 years hoping that my abuser would be brought to justice for what he did to me,” Carter said.
“With today’s announcement, all hope of justice for my case is gone.” Kelly was indicted in Cook County in 2019 after Foxx pleaded with survivors to come forward.
The R&amp;B star is awaiting sentencing for a child-pornography case in Chicago federal court as well as serving a 30-year sentence for a New York case.

     Charges officially dropped against R. Kelly in Cook County
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In less than two minutes, a sexual abuse case against R&amp;B singer Robert Kelly was dropped Tuesday morning in a fifth-floor courtroom at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse.
“It will be motion state nolle,” Cook County Assistant State’s Attorney Tene McCoy Cummings told Judge Lawrence Flood, four years after the charges were filed against the singer.
Kelly faces between 10 and 90 years in prison in that case and is already serving a 30-year sentence for his 2021 conviction on racketeering and other charges in Brooklyn.
Still, Foxx acknowledged that her office had heard from at least one alleged victim who was disappointed with the decision.
“That is really our next battle,” Bonjean told reporters, joined by several Kelly supporters who attended the hearing.
