     Massive humpback whale washes ashore in New York amid ‘unusual’ spate of deaths: ‘Happening a little too often’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The large humpback washed ashore on Lido Beach, on Long Island, around 6 a.m., officials said.
The humpback whale has no visible signs of injury, but investigators are hoping a necropsy will lead them to a cause of death.
Bulldozers and diggers were brought in to drag the whale to higher ground so it could be preserved for examination.
“It’s sad, but we couldn’t miss the opportunity to see a beached whale,” bystander Kate Magee told Nexstar’s WPIX.
While officials look for a cause of death, NOAA Fisheries said the investigation comes amid a spate of unusual elevated humpback whale deaths along the Atlantic coast since 2016, during which at least 180 humpback mortalities were observed between Maine and Florida.

     Federal authorities: Humpback whale that washed ashore on Long Island was tracked for 4 decades

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LIDO BEACH, N.Y. -- Federal authorities are examining a humpback whale that was found dead on a beach in Nassau County, trying to determine how it died.
Since late last year, several whales have washed ashore in New York and New Jersey.
Luna washed ashore Monday morning and created quite the spectacle on the sand as onlookers took pictures to memorialize the encounter.
More shots got snapped Tuesday of what some said was a once-in-a lifetime experience to see a whale this close.
Andrea Gomez with NOAA Fisheries spoke with CBS2 about Luna and the other recent whale deaths.

     Stranded humpback whale in New York is latest to die along East Coast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LIDO BEACH, N.Y. — A 35-foot humpback whale washed ashore and later died on a New York beach, one of several cetaceans discovered over the past two months along the shores of New York and New Jersey.
The whale was discovered Monday morning at Lido Beach West Town Park on Long Island.
Officials said it was still alive when found but died a short time later, according to news outlets.
Researchers hope to perform a necropsy to better understand what might have caused the whale to beach itself.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is responsible for the nation’s oceans and fisheries, said 19 humpback whales were stranded last year along the U.S. Atlantic coast.

     Summary: Marine biologists were conducting a necropsy Tuesday on a 41-foot humpback whale that died and washed up on shore in Lido Beach, but a cause of death may not be known for months.
Biologists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were cutting open the humpback whale to pull it apart and conduct tissue sample to determine the cause of death.
Humpback whales can live about 80 to 90 years old, she said.
