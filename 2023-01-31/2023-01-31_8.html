The atmosphere tonight will be absolutely electric so we can’t wait to see what it’s going to be like.
Newcastle was a sleeping giant that’s now woken up.
I think while we’re on the come up – it’s the best feeling.
I was at the Quarter-Final game which was the best atmosphere I’ve ever witnessed at St James’ Park – so I can’t imagine what tonight’s going to be like.

     Newcastle see off Southampton to reach League Cup final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEWCASTLE, England, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Newcastle United booked their place in a first major final in 24 years by overcoming Southampton 2-1 at home on Tuesday in their League Cup semi-final second leg to seal a 3-1 victory on aggregate.
Under the competition rules, Guimaraes is set to serve a three-match ban in the league for the dismissal but will be free to play again in the cup final on Feb. 26.
Newcastle will play either Manchester United or Nottingham Forest in the final at Wembley, with United holding a 3-0 lead ahead of their second leg on Wednesday at Old Trafford.
It will be the Magpies' first final since they lost 2-0 to United in the FA Cup showpiece in 1999 and their second appearance in the League Cup final, having lost to Manchester City in 1976.

     Newcastle 2-1 Southampton (agg: 3-1): Eddie Howe's side reach Carabao Cup final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eddie Howe's resurgent side will face either Manchester United or Nottingham Forest at Wembley as the Magpies attempt to win their first major trophy since the Inter Cities' Fairs Cup in 1969.
Howe has based Newcastle's revival on strong defence, with new signings Pope, Trippier, Dan Burn and Sven Botman making outstanding contributions.
Guimaraes, despite his dismissal against Southampton, has provided world-class flourishes in midfield, while £60m striker Alexander Isak has shown his quality despite injury problems.
Gordon must have relished his first experience of match night at St James' Park as a Newcastle player, able to watch fans who have been starved of success look forward to their first final in this competition since they lost to Manchester City in 1976.
We had a go in the second half but that's something we have to do from minute one.
