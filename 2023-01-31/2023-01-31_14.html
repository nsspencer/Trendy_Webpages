     Snap Stock Tumbles on Earnings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Snap stock was sinking in late trading Tuesday after the Snapchat parent missed earnings expectations and said it expects a first-quarter sales decline.
Snap said its fourth-quarter net loss was $288.5 million, or 18 cents a share, compared to analyst expectations for a loss of 11 cents a share.
Its non-GAAP, or adjusted, earnings were 14 cents a share.
Revenue of $1.3 billion was in line with expectations.

     Snap slides 13% as it indicates gloomy first-quarter revenues (NYSE:SNAP)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Snap stock (NYSE:SNAP) has tumbled 13% after hours after its fourth-quarter earnings report showed flat revenues and the company predicted a first-quarter drop of 2-10% in sales.
Flat revenues were largely expected for the fourth quarter, and the company isn't providing formal guidance for revenue or EBITDA for the current first quarter.
Daily active users came in narrowly ahead of schedule, rising 17% to 375M vs. expectations for 374.7M.
The company swung to a net loss of $288M (including restructuring charges of $34M), from net income of $23M in the prior-year period.
“We ended a challenging 2022 with 375 million Daily Active Users, 12% year-over-year annual revenue growth, and positive full year Free Cash Flow," CEO Evan Spiegel said.

     Snap earnings: What to expect
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Snap Inc. is about to give the first big indication of how the holiday period panned out for online advertisers, in a report that should hold clues for the bigger social-media names still to follow.
The Snapchat parent company rang some alarm bells three months back when its executives warned that marketers were lowering their budgets amid economic uncertainty.
Snap’s SNAP Tuesday afternoon report will show whether conditions improved at all since the time of that grim warning.

     Snap Quarterly Results Top Earnings Views, Miss Revenue Estimates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Snap (SNAP) reported fourth-quarter results late Tuesday that very narrowly fell short of revenue estimates and beat earnings forecasts during a tumultuous period for the social media company.
Snap stock plunged.
It has warned it may suffer a period of low revenue growth well into this year.
Jefferies analyst James Heaney maintained a hold rating on Snap stock and price target of 10.
"We would wait to see evidence of an improving revenue growth trajectory before becoming more positive," he said in his note to clients.

     Trading Strategies For Snap Stock Before And After Q4 Earnings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Snap Inc SNAP is set to print its fourth-quarter financial results after the markets close on Tuesday.
The stock was trading about 4% higher heading into the event.
When Snap printed its third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 20, the stock plunged almost 24% the next day to hit a new 52-week low of $7.33.
If Snap receives a positive reaction to its earnings print, the stock may surge up higher toward the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), where it may meet at least temporary resistance.
If Snap falls following the print, bullish traders will want to see the stock reverse upwards before trading under $9.50 to keep the uptrend intact.
