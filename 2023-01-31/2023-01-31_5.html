     Tyler Huntley replaces Billsâ€™ Josh Allen in Pro Bowl: Which AFC QB would be a better pick?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ravens backup quarterback Tyler Huntley has been named to the Pro Bowl as an injury replacement for Bills quarterback Josh Allen, the Ravens announced Tuesday.
Huntley, who turns 25 on Feb. 3, threw for 658 yards with two touchdowns, three interceptions and a 77.2 passer rating.
In other Pro Bowl quarterback news, the Jaguarsâ€™ Trevor Lawrence will replace the Chiefsâ€™ Patrick Mahomes since Mahomes will be playing in Super Bowl LVII.
GO DEEPER Pro Bowl skill competition to include flag football, dodgeballIs Huntley really worthy of the Pro Bowl?
Thereâ€™s absolutely no reason Huntley should be named to the Pro Bowl as any kind of replacement.

     2023 Pro Bowl Games: How Ravens' Tyler Huntley made it despite playing just six games, plus other alternates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the 2023 Pro Bowl Games, the league's new spin on its annual pre-Super Bowl showcase, will feature the Ravens quarterback as one of three AFC quarterbacks, despite the backup playing just six games in 2022.
And why is Huntley's improbable Pro Bowl berth not nearly as maddening as it might seem?
Huntley, therefore, will join fellow alternate Trevor Lawrence and Carr as the AFC's actual Pro Bowl Games QBs.
Maybe, just maybe, Huntley will prove us all wrong.
He won't be the only player taking part in the Pro Bowl Games as a promoted alternate.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite being the Ravens' backup and not seeing any action until December, Huntley beat out other quarterbacks such as the Titans' Ryan Tannehill, Raiders' Derek Carr, and Patriots' Mac Jones in Pro Bowl voting, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.
It will be a first Pro Bowl trip for Huntley, who just finished his third season.
With Lamar Jackson sidelined by a knee injury, Huntley started the Ravens' final five games, including in the wild-card playoffs against the Cincinnati Bengals.

When youâ€™re statistically inferior to Davis Mills and making the Pro Bowl itâ€™s a sign we need to dismantle this whole thing and rethink it all.
And he's in the Pro Bowl.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baltimore Ravens quarterback Tyler Huntley is heading to the Pro Bowl despite starting just four games in 2022.
Huntley was named as a Pro Bowl replacement for Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen on Tuesday.
Huntleyâ€™s inclusion into the Pro Bowl sure is odd given his limited playing time and lack of eye-popping stats.
But itâ€™s also not a surprise given the way that alternate voting for the Pro Bowl went in December.
Why Huntley was named to the Pro BowlVoting for Pro Bowl alternates takes place after the teams for the Pro Bowl are announced.
