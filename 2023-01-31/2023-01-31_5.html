     Morgan Wallen heads to grandma’s house for new album – KIK-FM 100.7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Big Loud/MercuryThe cover of Morgan Wallen‘s new album shows him standing outside his late grandmother’s house in his hometown of Sneedville, Tennessee.
“My Mamaw Boots helped raise me,” he explains.
“I had such a special bond with her, so I wanted to honor her with this new record.”Morgan also showcases some of his other influences on One Thing at a Time, which arrives March 3: he works The Allman Brothers‘ “Midnight Rider” into the track “Everything I Love” and samples Young Thug‘s “Lifestyle” on “180 (Lifestyle).”Quite a few cuts from the gargantuan 36-song album are already out: “Last Night,” “Everything I Love” and “I Wrote the Book” came out Monday.
The record also includes Morgan’s chart-topping “You Proof,” as well as his top-five “Thought You Should Know.”Copyright © 2023, ABC Audio.

     Morgan Wallen's 'Everything I Love' Sticks With a Winning Formula
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After announcing his colossal, 36-track One Thing at a Time album on Monday (Jan. 3), Morgan Wallen wasted no time in introducing fans to some of the project's tracks.
He dropped three new songs — "Everything I Love," "Last Night" and "I Wrote the Book" — at midnight, and taken all together, the songs represent a mix of familiar subject matter and uncharted ground.
"Everything I Love," perhaps the most radio-ready and traditionally country of the trio, doesn't deviate too far from what Wallen already knows will work.
It's a heartbreak ballad with honky-tonk leanings, and plenty of references to trucks, whiskey and back roads.
The singer is likely to show more range as more songs emerge — 36 tracks is a lot, after all.
