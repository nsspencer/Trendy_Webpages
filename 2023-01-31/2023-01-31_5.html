    </h2>

     Summary: Previously a vulture was apparently killed and a clouded leopard escaped after its cage was cut open.
Zoo officials confirmed a hole was found in the enclosure of the emperor tamarin monkeys and two are believed to have been stolen.
In a statement, the zoo said: “Emperor tamarin monkeys would likely stay close to home – the zoo searched near their habitat and across zoo grounds, and did not locate them.

According to the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, emperor tamarins are native to the south-west Amazon basin.
