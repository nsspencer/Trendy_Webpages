     James Gunn unveils DC's new film and TV plan, including fresh spins on Supergirl, Batman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a taped video posted to social media, Gunn outlined nearly a dozen projects that will be part of the DCEU's first new chapter, dubbed "Gods and Monsters."
"So as many of you know, DC has been disconnected in film and television for a long time," Gunn said in a video posted on Twitter.
"And it's one of our jobs, mine and Peter's, to come in and make sure the DCU is connected in film, television, gaming, and animation that the characters are consistent, played by the same actors and it works within one story."
This includes "The Batman – Part II," a follow up film to Matt Reeves' "The Batman."
Here is what is coming as part of the next wave of DCEU projects.
