     8 dead in Utah murder-suicide after wife sought divorce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The killings rocked the small town of Enoch in southern Utah about halfway between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas.
Officials said they believe Michael Haight killed his wife, 40-year-old Tausha Haight; his mother-in-law; and the couple’s five children.
Court records show that Tausha Haight filed for divorce Dec. 21.
The reasons for the divorce were unknown, in part because Utah law keeps details of divorce proceedings sealed from the public.
James Park, who represented Tausha Haight in the divorce case, said she had not expressed any fear that her husband would physically hurt her.
