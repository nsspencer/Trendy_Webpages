     WWE shares jump as Vince McMahon stages comeback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vince McMahon is staging a comeback at World Wrestling Entertainment , months after he retired from the company over a sexual misconduct scandal.
McMahon said that his return is necessary as the company gears up for negotiations over media rights and strategic alternatives.
WWE, which styles itself as a media company, has been mentioned as a potential acquisition target.
McMahon retired last year amid an investigation into payments the former CEO made regarding alleged instances of sexual misconduct.
A special committee probe found that McMahon had paid nearly $15 million to four women over the course of 16 years in order to silence sexual misconduct allegations.

     Vince McMahon back at WWE ahead of media rights negotiations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former WWE CEO Vince McMahon, who remains the controlling shareholder of the wrestling organization, plans to return to the company to "fully capitalize" on the upcoming media rights negotiations, he announced Thursday.
After McMahon stepped away, his daughter, Stephanie McMahon, and Nick Khan, a longtime agent at CAA, assumed the roles of co-CEO.
"WWE is entering a critical juncture in its history with the upcoming media rights negotiations coinciding with increased industry-wide demand for quality content and live events and with more companies seeking to own the intellectual property on their platforms," McMahon said.
WWE's rights deals with Fox and USA expire next year; negotiations are expected to begin later in 2023.
McMahon bought the company from his father in 1982 and built the then-WWF into the preeminent wrestling company in the world.

     Former WWE chief Vince McMahon plans return as executive chairman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 5 (Reuters) - Vince McMahon, the former chief of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE.N), plans to return to the company that he transformed from a regional player in a highly fragmented industry of the 1980s to a global giant, he said in a statement on Thursday.
McMahon said that he expects to assume the role of executive chairman at WWE, to involve himself in the company's media rights negotiation process and review of strategic alternatives.
McMahon, who has majority voting power in the company, has informed WWE that he is electing himself and two former co-presidents and directors Michelle Wilson and George Barrios to the board.
The former executive, who ran the company for four decades, said that the only way for WWE to fully capitalize on growing demand for content and live entertainment was for him to return as executive chairman.
McMahon retired in July last year as the company's CEO and chairman, following an investigation into his alleged misconduct.

     Summary: CategoriesMUST-READ LIST NEWS TICKER WWE NewsBy Jason Powell, ProWrestling.net Editor (@prowrestlingnet)Vince McMahon is making moves to reclaim the power he forfeited when he resigned from WWE.
The Wall Street Journal reports that McMahon has informed the WWE Board of Directors that he is electing himself and former WWE executives George Barrios and Michelle Wilson to the board.
“The move to reinstate Mr. McMahon, which the board previously rebuffed, and the others will require three current directors to vacate their positions,” reads the story.
WSJ previously reported that their sources had stated that Vince was interested in returning because he felt he had been given bad advice when he was advised to reign.
Today’s WSJ reporting provides evidence that he is officially making his play.

     Wall Street Journal: Vince McMahon plots return to WWE
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York CNN —Vince McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment chief executive, who retired from the company last year following a hush money and sexual harassment scandal, is plotting a return to the WWE, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
The WWE has disclosed multiple expenses that McMahon hadn’t disclosed, totaling $19.6 million, which forced the company to revise its financial statements for 2019, 2020 and 2021.
The Journal in July reported McMahon paid more than $12 million to four women, including the one from the prior report, to cover up “allegations of sexual misconduct and infidelity.”Now, the 77-year old McMahon is attempting a comeback.
McMahon’s daughter, Stephanie McMahon took over as board chair and co-CEO after Vince McMahon’s retirement in July.
WWE and Vince McMahon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
