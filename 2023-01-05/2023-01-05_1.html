     M3GAN Predicted to Make Profit From Just Its Opening Weekend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Helped by a PG-13 rating and almost perfect early reviews, M3GAN is looking to slash up the box office this weekend to the tune of up to $20 million.
However, the film’s opening this weekend looks set to be an unexpected hit, with a predicted $17-$20 million box office that would see the movie make back its production cost and more besides.
With so many mega-budget movies being released recently and taking weeks to break even with slow or stunted box office results, it is almost hard to register that a film could turn a profit at the box office in just a single weekend.
However, M3GAN comes with a lowly $12 million budget and according to Variety, the film’s opening weekend could easily pull back that cost and much more.

     M3GAN Review: AI Doll Goes Feral in Johnstone’s Wickedly Fun Horror Film
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This concept is humorously explored in Gerard Johnstone’s campy horror flick from a story by Akela Cooper and James Wan.
Blending heart and humor in a film with plentiful bloody kills, M3GAN is a fun time at the movies.
After her eight-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw), becomes an orphan after a terrible accident, Gemma suddenly finds her life is put on hold to be a caretaker.

     M3GAN Review – Blumhouse's New Killer Doll Aims to Entertain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From the moment M3GAN was introduced in trailers and danced her way into the internet’s collective hearts, the high-tech killer doll seemed destined for horror icon status.
The horror-comedy does live up to its promise to entertain, but with a heavy emphasis on humor and less on horror.
Ill-equipped to raise a grieving child, workaholic Gemma combines her work and home life by pairing Cady with M3GAN, a lifelike companion who can react and learn.
Much like its killer star, M3GAN seems more destined to resonate with a younger audience.
If they keep introducing wild horror villains like Gabriel and M3GAN, the more, the merrier.

     M3gan, the murder doll, is already a camp horror icon in the making
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Is that part of the reason you think M3gan has resonated with queer people, and gay men in particular?
We also see the M3gan doll in the trailer drop onto all fours and sort of run like an animal, to attack somebody.
I will say that I don’t think M3gan could have crawled or ran without Chucky walking.
And I’m all for strange and stranger entries into horror, and there’s not enough doll horror out there.
If Annabelle is the top killer doll movie, we need M3gan or someone to dethrone Annabelle.

     Summary: “When I was writing ‘M3GAN,’ did I think that there were going to be dancing M3GANs at the premiere at the Chinese Theatre?
Horror fans know you as the writer of the delightfully bonkers “Malignant,” but you actually wrote “M3GAN” first.
Even the roboticist characters designing M3GAN in the movie know that.
