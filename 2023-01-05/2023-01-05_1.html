     M3GAN Movie Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As for the underlying emotional plot of the film, in which Gemma uses M3GAN to stifle her own anxiety and Cady’s grief, it never gains traction.
The movie uses it as a narrative engine but doesn’t dig into the genuinely intriguing nuances of this relationship triangle.
In this one moment, you begin to wonder whether M3GAN learned her violent impulses from Cady, who, after all, is the person she’s been programmed to mimic.
It’s not a movie you watch for the airtight quality of its storytelling or the subtlety of its technological cautionary tale.
It’s a movie you watch because its titular character is “archly iconique,” unnecessarily couture in a satin pussy bow and matching double-breasted jacket.

     'M3GAN' review: You'll love the mean-girl robot in this darkly funny, cautionary tale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gemma “pairs” her new project – M3GAN, short for Model 3 Generative Android – with Cady and their connection is immediate.
McGraw holds her own, too, since Cady’s tumultuous emotions run deep and she begins to use M3GAN as a snarky role model.
M3GAN talks back, goes feral when hunting her prey (such as mean bullies) and busts out TikTok-ready dance moves before wreaking violent havoc.
"M3GAN" rocks plenty of style and offers some crafty needle drops: A bit of "Toy Soldiers" is especially clever.
The smartest parts, however, dig into the themes of being a mom or dad in the age of screen time.

     Is ‘M3GAN’ Streaming on HBO Max or Netflix?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While a streaming release date has not yet been announced for M3GAN, we can estimate when it could head to Peacock based on another Universal Pictures movie.
WILL M3GAN BE ON HBO MAX?
No, M3GAN will not be on HBO Max since it’s not a Warner Bros. movie.
While the company previously released its movies on HBO Max and in theaters on the same day, they have since stopped and have implemented a 45-day window between the theatrical release and streaming release.
No, M3GAN will not be available on Netflix — at least not anytime soon, since it will be heading straight to Peacock after its theatrical release.

     M3gan, the murder doll, is already a camp horror icon in the making
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Is that part of the reason you think M3gan has resonated with queer people, and gay men in particular?
We also see the M3gan doll in the trailer drop onto all fours and sort of run like an animal, to attack somebody.
I will say that I don’t think M3gan could have crawled or ran without Chucky walking.
And I’m all for strange and stranger entries into horror, and there’s not enough doll horror out there.
If Annabelle is the top killer doll movie, we need M3gan or someone to dethrone Annabelle.

     Summary: “When I was writing ‘M3GAN,’ did I think that there were going to be dancing M3GANs at the premiere at the Chinese Theatre?
Horror fans know you as the writer of the delightfully bonkers “Malignant,” but you actually wrote “M3GAN” first.
Even the roboticist characters designing M3GAN in the movie know that.
