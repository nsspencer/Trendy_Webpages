     Summary: LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Prince Harry declined to commit to going to the coronation of his father King Charles, according to a clip from an upcoming interview with broadcaster ITV, adding that staying silent about his issues with the British royal family would not help matters.
Asked if he would attend the coronation if he is invited, Harry says: "There is a lot that can happen between now and then.
"There's a lot to be discussed and I really hope that they are willing to sit down and talk about it."
"I don't know how staying silent is ever going to make things better," Harry said.
The ITV interview and a separate appearance on U.S. broadcaster CBS's "60 Minutes" programme will be shown on Sunday, two days before publication of Harry's autobiography.

     Summary: Prince William will not forgive Prince Harry for spilling their closest secrets, friends of the Prince of Wales have said after Harry revealed how he and William came to physical blows over Meghan Markle in 2019.
Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace have so far declined to comment on Harry’s version of the alleged altercation.
In the excerpt published in the Guardian, Harry claims that a furious argument broke out between the brothers in the kitchen of his London home in 2019.
The fact that Harry has written about private family moments and the specifics of intimate conversations will be concerning and upsetting for the royals.
One source who was with William just before Christmas told Vanity Fair: “William worries everything and anything he says will be made public.
