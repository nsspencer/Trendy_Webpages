     M3GAN Movie Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As for the underlying emotional plot of the film, in which Gemma uses M3GAN to stifle her own anxiety and Cady’s grief, it never gains traction.
The movie uses it as a narrative engine but doesn’t dig into the genuinely intriguing nuances of this relationship triangle.
In this one moment, you begin to wonder whether M3GAN learned her violent impulses from Cady, who, after all, is the person she’s been programmed to mimic.
It’s not a movie you watch for the airtight quality of its storytelling or the subtlety of its technological cautionary tale.
It’s a movie you watch because its titular character is “archly iconique,” unnecessarily couture in a satin pussy bow and matching double-breasted jacket.

     'M3gan' review: Allison Williams stars in a smart horror take on a little girl and her robot friend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adding to her horror credentials from “Get Out,” Williams’ Gemma is forced to take in her suddenly orphaned nine-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw), who lost mom and dad in a car accident.
M3GAN is a marvel, with only a few minor glitches at first that ought to alarm everyone a little more than they do.
(From left) Cady (Violet McGraw), M3GAN and Gemma (Allison Williams) in 'M3GAN,' directed by Gerard Johnstone.
Director Gerard Johnstone builds up nicely toward those moments, smartly taking its time before the casualties and coincidences start piling up.
Horror has been among the most reliable genres at the box office since the pandemic began, and “M3GAN” seems poised to continue that streak.

     ‘M3gan’ Review: She Walks, Talks and Kills
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In “M3gan,” the titular gadget—a “Model 3 Generative Android” that looks like the lost Olsen sister—teaches a little girl proper bathroom procedure with military rigor while the kid’s guardian occupies herself with more diverting activities.
All things considered, some parents might be willing to overlook the cuddly robot’s shortcomings, such as a sarcastic streak and a tendency to commit homicide.
“M3gan,” a mildly scary movie built around a valid underlying fear, became a social-media phenomenon months before it was released thanks to the killer dance moves exhibited by its title figure.
Bored by the demands of a small child and pressured by her volcanically demanding boss ( Ronny Chieng ) to create a next-level toy, Gemma solves both problems by programming a lifelike ambulatory doll that, learning from feedback, can read emotions and take part in spontaneous conversations exhibiting real emotional intelligence.
Within a distressingly short period of time, however, M3gan starts to turn self-aware, posing questions like, “Will I die?”

     M3gan, the murder doll, is already a camp horror icon in the making
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Is that part of the reason you think M3gan has resonated with queer people, and gay men in particular?
We also see the M3gan doll in the trailer drop onto all fours and sort of run like an animal, to attack somebody.
I will say that I don’t think M3gan could have crawled or ran without Chucky walking.
And I’m all for strange and stranger entries into horror, and there’s not enough doll horror out there.
If Annabelle is the top killer doll movie, we need M3gan or someone to dethrone Annabelle.

     The writer behind ‘M3GAN’ on its bonkers horror (and why it used to be ‘way gorier’)
    </h2>

     Summary: “When I was writing ‘M3GAN,’ did I think that there were going to be dancing M3GANs at the premiere at the Chinese Theatre?
Horror fans know you as the writer of the delightfully bonkers “Malignant,” but you actually wrote “M3GAN” first.
Even the roboticist characters designing M3GAN in the movie know that.
