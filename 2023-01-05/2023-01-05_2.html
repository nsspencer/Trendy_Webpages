But Twain didn’t let the year end without sharing her big plans for 2023: her sixth studio album Queen of Me is slated for release next month, and an accompanying global tour will take her across North America and the UK throughout this year.
Twain first gave a glimpse of the direction she’s heading in Queen of Me with lead single “Waking Up Dreaming.” Now, with less than a month until the album’s release, Twain is ready to hit the road: her new single “Giddy Up!”, out today, is meant to be a representation of what Queen of Me is all about.
“These days, I'm feeling very comfortable in my own skin — and I think this album reflects that musically,” the singer first wrote of the album on Instagram.
“Life is short and I want to be uplifted, colorful, unapologetic and empowered.

     Summary: I want to set a celebratory tone and ‘Giddy Up!’ is a way to call to the audience and say ‘let’s get ready for some fun!
'”The exclamation point-loving singer runs down the importance of savoring the moment in the first verse, joyfully singing, “I left my heart at a waterin’ hole/ Somewhere in small-town Ohio/ Headed out west to Arizona/ ‘Cause the East Coast weather’s too cold, cold, cold/ Easy come, easy go/ I got a fast car with the nineties on/ Not a soul on the road but the road is home,” before busting into the party hearty chorus.
“Smiles for miles/ All up on my face/ Wear it, share it/ ‘Cause we ain’t got time to waste/ Up in your giddy up/ Giddy, giddy up/ Up in your giddy up/ Drunk in the city/ Got litty in the cup/ Up in your giddy up/ When it gets tough, gotta get a little love/ Put some up in your giddy, giddy up,” she sings over the song’s bouncy rhythm.
