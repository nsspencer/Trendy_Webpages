     How Manchester United beat Everton 3-1 to advance in FA Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United topped Everton 3-1 in the opening match of the third round of the FA Cup.
Coady went from hero to villain early in the second half after he scored an own goal attempting to cut out a Marcus Rashford cross.
Demarai Gray, who set up Calvert-Lewin's non-goal, was one of the visiting side's bright spots.
Marcus Rashford added United's third goal with nearly the last kick of the game, converting from the penalty spot after Ben Godfrey brought down Alejandro Garnacho in the box.
It's a seventh successive victory for Erik ten Hag's side in all competitions, who will find out their fourth-round opponent on Sunday.

     Summary: We are there where we want to be but, still we go from game to game.
But at this moment it’s on us to bring them with us, to stand up and play for Everton.
United went straight on the attack but, a good interception by Alex Iwobi gave him the chance to race away with Malacia getting back and catching the Nigerians right ankle.
Everton were being pinned back in their own half and after Coady blocked a Rashford shot, Shaw fouled Maupay to give the Blues a moment of respite.
Doucoure was next to see a yellow card as Rashford went down, Eriksen sending the free kick straight into the waiting hands of Pickford.
