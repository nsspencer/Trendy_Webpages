     Summary: Prince Harry alleges in a much-anticipated new memoir that his brother Prince William lashed out and physically attacked him during a furious argument over the brothers’ deteriorating relationshipLONDON -- Prince Harry says his brother William physically attacked him during a ferocious argument — one of many startling allegations in a new memoir that includes revelations about the estranged royal's drug-taking, first sexual encounter and role in killing people during his military service in Afghanistan.
In the ghostwritten memoir, titled “Spare,” Harry said that his brother Prince William lashed out during a furious argument over the siblings' deteriorating relationship.
Harry says he had scrapes and bruises as a result of the tussle, for which William later apologized.
The memoir is the latest in a string of public revelations and accusations by Harry and Meghan that have shaken Britain’s royal family.
Asked by ITV's Tom Bradby whether he will play a part in the British monarchy's future, Harry said: “I don’t know.”
