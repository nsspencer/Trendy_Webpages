     Shania Twain Is Rocking Pink Hair for Her 'Queen of Me' Era
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shania Twain's upcoming new album, Queen of Me, is all about finding self-love and self-confidence at every age and stage — and having fun along the way.
As she invites listeners to find joy in who they are, Twain is leading by example: She's headed into her new album cycle with whimsical, cotton candy pink hair.
Twain's pink hair has been a theme, though not a constant, in her recent public appearances.
She donned pink hair — and a variety of colorful wigs — in the music video for "Waking Up Dreaming," the first single off of Queen of Me, and again at the 2022 People's Choice Awards.
Twain is known for incorporating eye-catching, well-thought-out details into the visual aesthetics she pairs with her music, including stage design, video directing and fashion.

'”The exclamation point-loving singer runs down the importance of savoring the moment in the first verse, joyfully singing, “I left my heart at a waterin’ hole/ Somewhere in small-town Ohio/ Headed out west to Arizona/ ‘Cause the East Coast weather’s too cold, cold, cold/ Easy come, easy go/ I got a fast car with the nineties on/ Not a soul on the road but the road is home,” before busting into the party hearty chorus.
“Smiles for miles/ All up on my face/ Wear it, share it/ ‘Cause we ain’t got time to waste/ Up in your giddy up/ Giddy, giddy up/ Up in your giddy up/ Drunk in the city/ Got litty in the cup/ Up in your giddy up/ When it gets tough, gotta get a little love/ Put some up in your giddy, giddy up,” she sings over the song’s bouncy rhythm.
