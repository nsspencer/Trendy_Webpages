     Amazon to cut 18,000 jobs as tech layoffs continue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon has announced that it will be “eliminating” more than 18,000 roles at the company, extending a previously-announced round of layoffs that was set to impact some 10,000 workers.
The announcement is significant in terms of the number of people impacted, though it represents just 1.2% of Amazon’s 1.5 million global headcount.
Layoffs continueThe news comes just a day after Salesforce announced that it was cutting around 10% of its workforce, impacting more than 7,000 employees, and continues a trend that saw countless companies throughout 2022 scale back their workforces to counter economic headwinds.
Data from layoff-tracking website Layoffs.fyi suggests that tech companies cut more than 150,000 positions in 2022.
“We typically wait to communicate about these outcomes until we can speak with the people who are directly impacted,” Jassy wrote.

     Amazon layoffs will top 18K, many in retail
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dive Brief:Following a review of its operations, Amazon is laying off more employees in its retail business, CEO Andy Jassy told employees Wednesday.
In all, including layoffs confirmed in November, Amazon will “eliminate just over 18,000 roles,” primarily in its Amazon Stores, and People, Experience and Technology divisions, according to Jassy’s blog post.
“These changes will help us pursue our long-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure,” he said.
“With solid profits flowing, Amazon also became very bullish about expanding into new areas and was generous in staffing those divisions.
But Amazon, infamous for its data capabilities, should probably have known better, according to Saunders.

     Amazon to cut 18,000 jobs as layoffs expand in tech sector
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) layoffs will now include more than 18,000 roles as part of a workforce reduction it previously disclosed, Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in a public staff note on Wednesday.
The layoff decisions, which Amazon will communicate starting Jan. 18, will largely impact the company's e-commerce and human resources organizations, he said.
Amazon has more than 1.5 million workers including warehouse staff, making it America's second-largest private employer after Walmart Inc (WMT.N).
Jassy's note followed a report in the Wall Street Journal that the reduction would be more than 17,000 jobs.
Amazon still must file certain legal notices about mass layoffs, and it plans to pay severance.

     The end of ‘everything’ at Amazon: Record layoffs signal new mindset for sprawling tech giant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a memo to employees, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company will apply its “Invent and Simplify” leadership principle not just to products but to its own organization.
That was the message to Amazon employees Wednesday from Andy Jassy, signaling a shift in mindset with significant implications for the company’s future.
The 18,000-person layoff is the largest in Amazon’s history and, in raw numbers, the biggest by any tech company in the past year.
“Simplify, simplify, simplify!”So what does this mean at Amazon, in practice?
It’s just one of the ways Amazon’s past approach might not match its new reality.

     Amazon cutting total of 18,000 workers as tech layoffs mount
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon said it is slashing a total of 18,000 jobs, a larger number of positions than it previously announced and the largest set of layoffs in the e-commerce giant's history.
Jassy said the layoffs will mostly impact the company's brick-and-mortar stores, which include Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and its PXT organizations, which handle human resources and other functions.
In November, he told staff the layoffs were coming due to the economic landscape and the company's rapid hiring in the last several years.
Amazon, which has a total global workforce of 1.5 million, is one of a number of major tech companies shedding workers after hiring aggressively in recent years.
Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Netflix, Peloton, Twitter and other tech companies have announced sizable layoffs or scaled back hiring in recent months amid weakening economic growth.
