     Summary: AP Sports Writer AUSTIN, Texas (AP) – Texas has fired basketball coach Chris Beard, who faces a felony domestic family violence charge after his fiancée told police he strangled and bit her.
The Associated Press has obtained the termination letter that was sent to Beard’s attorney.
Beard had been suspended without pay since Dec. 12.
The woman initially told officers that Beard choked her from behind, bit her and hit her during an argument.
Beard’s attorney has said he is innocent and she later denied she was choked.

     Summary: Texas head men's basketball coach Chris Beard was fired Thursday, less than one month after the school suspended him without pay following his arrest on a domestic family violence charge.
Associate head coach Rodney Terry, who has been the acting head coach since Beard's suspension, will remain in charge the rest of the season.
"The University of Texas has parted ways with Chris Beard," he said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Still, Texas is one of the more desirable jobs in college basketball -- arguably a top-10 job at that -- which could lead to a nationwide search.
Texas coaching candidatesRodney Terry, Texas interim coach: Any sensible list of candidates has to start with Terry for reasons already stated.
Simply put, this is likely Terry's job to loseJohn Calipari, Kentucky coach: All things being equal, there are few reasons for a men's basketball coach to leave Kentucky for Texas.
Chris Holtmann, Ohio State coach: The Ohio State job is comparable to the Texas job in that it's a great job at a school with unlimited resources.
PredictionInterim coaches who do well sometimes land the job, and I'm assuming such will be the case at Texas.
