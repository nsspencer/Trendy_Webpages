     Knicks 117, Spurs 114: You knew what was coming — The Strickland: A New York Knicks Site Guaranteed To Make 'Em Jump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been a while since the Knicks’ best player also measured up as a follow-my-lead leader.
Carmelo Anthony’s vibe was mostly points, becoming a digital athlete and then everything else, in that order.
But listen to the roar of the crowd for that one play, so early in the game against a team no one cares about.
As for the new hardwiring, dig this: after Brunson’s miss and turnover, the Knicks were down two.
That uncertainty is a helluva better vibe than viewing those games as a couple of Ls.

     Jalen Brunson masterclass nearly ruined by major Knicks weakness

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 4, 2023; New York, New York, USA; New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson (11) reacts during the fourth quarter against the San Antonio Spurs at Madison Square Garden.
Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsAfter barely squeezing past the San Antonio Spurs, the Knicks are now 21-18 on the season.
Considering how bad the Spurs have been this year, this game was closer than it should have been.
Not only was Brunson cooking all game, but he hit some big-time shots down the stretch to help the Knicks pull away from the pesky Spurs.
The starters have looked absolutely fantastic recently and have been the sole reason the Knicks have been winning.

     Knicks problems closing out games on display in win over Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yes, the New York Knicks won on Wednesday night, and, yes, they are now guaranteed to have a winning record at the halfway mark of the season.
Despite those positive takeaways the team also continued to display a troubling inability to close out games.
Even after the Knicks reclaimed the advantage, they still needed a flukey five-second inbounding violation on the Spurs with five seconds left in the game to secure the win.
Immanuel Quickley has stepped into his spot in the starting lineup and has played 43.1 minutes per game over his last five games.
In last night’s win over the Spurs, despite Brunson scoring 38 points, three of the last five New York possessions were Randle isolation plays.

     Landry Fields was a Knicks cult hero. What happened after he left set him on a path to running one of their rivals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The injury was so traumatic and sort of demonized the game,” Fields said.
“I would’ve thought I’d still be playing at age 34,” Fields said the week before his latest promotion.
Landry Fields’ commitment to “doing the little things” earned him a starting role as a rookie with the Knicks during the 2010-11 season.
As a rookie, Fields averaged 31 minutes per game.
“I don’t put as much stock into it as I did as a player,” Fields said.
