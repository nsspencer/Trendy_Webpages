(Photo by James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)Chelsea will face Manchester City at Stamford Bridge in a crucial Premier League match on Thursday night.
Manchester City, meanwhile, are second with 36 points from 16 matches and will have a chance to close within 5 points of table-toppers Arsenal should they win on Thursday.
Grealish also had a good match against Everton but has a tendency to spend a bit too much time on the ball.
Chelsea looking to exploit City’s high defensive lineIt can be safely assumed Manchester City will dominate possession on Thursday and will look to increase numbers in the opposition half to break their defensive set-up.

     Summary: Jan 5 (Reuters) - Chelsea have completed the transfer of defender Benoit Badiashile from Ligue 1 side Monaco, the Premier League club said on Thursday, with the Frenchman signing a seven-and-a-half-year contract.

I can't wait to see the fans and start playing in the best league in the world," Badiashile said.

     Summary: Hello and welcome to The Athletic's live blog for today's Premier League match between Chelsea and Manchester City.
Chelsea were the better side for most of the first half, but chances were few and far between for both sides.
Chukwuemeka did hit the post for the home side, while Erling Haaland had City's best opportunity to open the scoring during the first 45 minutes.
Graham Potter's extensive list of injuries grew even longer today, as Mason Mount was ruled out before the game and both Raheem Sterling and Christian Pulisic went down hurt in the opening 20 minutes of this contest.
