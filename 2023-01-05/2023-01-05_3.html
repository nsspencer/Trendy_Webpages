     How much does John Fetterman appear in Netflix’s ‘The Pale Blue Eye’? Not much.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fetterman makes a cameo in The Pale Blue Eye, a 19th-century drama starring Christian Bale, which debuted Friday on Netflix.
But, as Fetterman tweeted last month, his wife Gisele also makes a cameo in The Pale Blue Eye.
But it may be one of the funniest, given the reasoning behind why he’s is in The Pale Blue Eye.
Fetterman assisted Bale and director Scott Cooper on 2013′s Out of the Furnace, which filmed in Braddock, Pa., where Fetterman was mayor for more than a decade.
So, when it came time to shoot The Pale Blue Eye, also filmed largely in Western Pennsylvania, Bale had one guy in mind.

    </h2>

     Summary: Warning: This post contains spoilers for The Pale Blue Eye.
After debuting in select theaters on Dec. 23, The Pale Blue Eye, a gothic murder mystery featuring Edgar Allen Poe as one of the detectives on the case, is now streaming on Netflix.
Based on Louis Bayard’s 2003 novel of the same name, The Pale Blue Eye transports viewers to snow-swept upstate New York in 1830.
While The Pale Blue Eye is a work of fiction, the real-life Poe did in fact attend West Point before being kicked out in January 1831 less than seven months after he was admitted.

     The Pale Blue Eye review: Christian Bale gets pulpy in a horror mystery
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cooper is adapting an appropriately Edgar-nominated novel by Louis Bayard, and he doesn’t take the story into a winking, silly direction.
Bale, for his part, lets his natural intensity recede enough that Landor becomes that audience.
This is not a movie that flouts murder mystery traditions, which the real Poe helped establish.
In this movie, Poe is more of a romantic Sherlock Holmes figure: the eccentric, misunderstood genius capable of examining the world as a beautiful puzzle box.
So it’s perfect, in a way, that Edgar Allan Poe keeps turning up to jolt his own story back to life.

Cooper has been contemplating the chief questions of “The Pale Blue Eye” since reading it after directing his first film, “Crazy Heart.”“What drives someone to madness?
“Watching TV in England when I was growing up, [I’d see] films that I didn’t know were Edgar Allan Poe [adaptations],” Bale said.
“Harry really understood that we were creating a character that defies what we think of Poe,” Cooper adds.

     The Pale Blue Eye Is Grisly, Grim, and Surprisingly Moving
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Robert Duvall, Christian Bale, and Harry Melling in The Pale Blue Eye.
Photo: Scott Garfield/NetflixThe barren trees and snowy ridges of the Hudson Valley in winter have rarely looked as forbidding as they do in Scott Cooper’s The Pale Blue Eye, a mystery that’s more about mood than ingenuity.
Based on Louis Bayard’s 2003 novel, The Pale Blue Eye follows a veteran New York detective, Augustus Landor (Christian Bale), living by himself in the woods, who is pulled out of retirement to investigate the grisly death of a cadet at the United States Military Academy.
On a purely narrative level, The Pale Blue Eye offers relatively standard developments: a hidden note here, an unnoticed wound there, an encrypted diary there.
Even so, what ultimately resonates are the picture’s surprisingly moving central relationship and its vivid setting.
