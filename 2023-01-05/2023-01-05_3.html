     Jalen Brunson masterclass nearly ruined by major Knicks weakness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 4, 2023; New York, New York, USA; New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson (11) reacts during the fourth quarter against the San Antonio Spurs at Madison Square Garden.
Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsAfter barely squeezing past the San Antonio Spurs, the Knicks are now 21-18 on the season.
Considering how bad the Spurs have been this year, this game was closer than it should have been.
Not only was Brunson cooking all game, but he hit some big-time shots down the stretch to help the Knicks pull away from the pesky Spurs.
The starters have looked absolutely fantastic recently and have been the sole reason the Knicks have been winning.

     Jalen Brunson's Career Night Leads Knicks to Win vs. Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After scoring a career-high 38 points, Jalen Brunson led the New York Knicks to a win over the San Antonio Spurs.
The New York Knicks (21-18) swept the season series with the San Antonio Spurs (13-26) after achieving a 117-114 victory.
Jalen Brunson set the tone for the Knicks with a career-high 38 points while adding seven rebounds and six assists.
With Julius Randle providing 25 points and 13 rebounds in the supporting cast, there was enough to get the win.
“Whatever it takes to win,” Brunson said.

     Knicks problems closing out games on display in win over Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yes, the New York Knicks won on Wednesday night, and, yes, they are now guaranteed to have a winning record at the halfway mark of the season.
Despite those positive takeaways the team also continued to display a troubling inability to close out games.
Even after the Knicks reclaimed the advantage, they still needed a flukey five-second inbounding violation on the Spurs with five seconds left in the game to secure the win.
Immanuel Quickley has stepped into his spot in the starting lineup and has played 43.1 minutes per game over his last five games.
In last night’s win over the Spurs, despite Brunson scoring 38 points, three of the last five New York possessions were Randle isolation plays.

     Spurs Player Takes Responsibility For Loss To Knicks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Antonio Spurs gave the New York Knicks a run for their money at Madison Square Garden.
However, just when the visitors had a chance to force overtime, they were called for a five-second violation that pretty much sealed the 117-114 loss.
I think it’s not on Jeremy [Sochan] because he was running the play.
You know, Jeremy did what he was supposed to do, and I messed it up.
The Spurs are a ways away from contention, but young guns like Johnson continue to make strides every day, and the future seems bright in Texas.

Getty ImagesRight now, the Knicks (21-18) are in sixth place — with an identical record to the surprising Pacers, whom the Knicks recently beat on the road.
Coming off a 53-win season and spot in the Eastern Conference finals, the Heat have begun to get going.
Thirteen of the Knicks’ next 14 games are against Eastern Conference opponents.

     Landry Fields was a Knicks cult hero. What happened after he left set him on a path to running one of their rivals
    </h2>

     Summary: “The injury was so traumatic and sort of demonized the game,” Fields said.
“I would’ve thought I’d still be playing at age 34,” Fields said the week before his latest promotion.
Landry Fields’ commitment to “doing the little things” earned him a starting role as a rookie with the Knicks during the 2010-11 season.
As a rookie, Fields averaged 31 minutes per game.
“I don’t put as much stock into it as I did as a player,” Fields said.
