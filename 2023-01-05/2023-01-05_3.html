     Summary: Prince Harry confirmed that he and his brother did not wish for King Charles to marry his longtime love, Camilla Parker-Bowles.
Though they were apparently united against the future queen consort, William and Harry agreed on little else in recent years.
On Wednesday, The Guardian released excerpts from the memoir that detailed a separate, physical fight between William and Harry at Nottingham Cottage.
William, under the pretense of helping Harry, had allegedly called Meghan “difficult,” “rude,” and “abrasive.” Harry writes that he said he couldn’t talk to William when he’s “like this,” and then things got physical.
“It all happened so fast,” Prince Harry recalls.
