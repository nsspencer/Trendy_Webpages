     Summary: Prince William will not forgive Prince Harry for spilling their closest secrets, friends of the Prince of Wales have said after Harry revealed how he and William came to physical blows over Meghan Markle in 2019.
Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace have so far declined to comment on Harry’s version of the alleged altercation.
In the excerpt published in the Guardian, Harry claims that a furious argument broke out between the brothers in the kitchen of his London home in 2019.
The fact that Harry has written about private family moments and the specifics of intimate conversations will be concerning and upsetting for the royals.
One source who was with William just before Christmas told Vanity Fair: “William worries everything and anything he says will be made public.

     Summary: Prince Harry confirmed that he and his brother did not wish for King Charles to marry his longtime love, Camilla Parker-Bowles.
Though they were apparently united against the future queen consort, William and Harry agreed on little else in recent years.
On Wednesday, The Guardian released excerpts from the memoir that detailed a separate, physical fight between William and Harry at Nottingham Cottage.
William, under the pretense of helping Harry, had allegedly called Meghan “difficult,” “rude,” and “abrasive.” Harry writes that he said he couldn’t talk to William when he’s “like this,” and then things got physical.
“It all happened so fast,” Prince Harry recalls.

     Summary: [1/3] LONDON, ENGLAND - SEPTEMBER 19: Prince William, Prince of Wales and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex follow behind The Queen's funeral cortege borne on the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy as it leaves Westminster Abbey on September 19, 2022 in London, England.
She married Prince Philip in 1947 and ascended the throne of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth on 6 February 1952 after the death of her Father, King George VI.
As is usual for the royal family, spokespeople for King Charles and Prince William have declined to comment.
William and Harry were once seen as very close after the death of their mother in a Paris car crash in 1997.
In another section of the book, Harry refers to his first meeting with Camilla, whom Diana had blamed for the break-up of her marriage.
