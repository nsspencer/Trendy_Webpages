     RUMOR: Cavs a Bojan Bogdanovic trade suitor, but there’s a catch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Published January 5, 2023By Alex Sabri · 2 min readThe Cleveland Cavaliers may be in the running for Detroit Pistons forward Bojan Bogdanovic, but the trade price may be too high for the Cavs to pay, Jake Fischer of Yahoo!
“Add in Cedi Osman, and Cleveland has a stockpile of rangy wings that can be effective, but leave something to be desired,” Fischer wrote.
“Are any of them the talented young player Detroit is partly searching for to offload Bojan Bogdanovic?
Bogdanovic is shooting 42.2% from the 3-point line in 40 games played, or 0.3% off the career high he averaged with the Indiana Pacers during the 2018-19 season.
Though Pistons forward Saddiq Bey would provide a fantastic young option for the Cavs that fits with the rest of their up-and-coming starting five’s timeline for a potential NBA championship, the Cavs may run into same issues when asking for the former Villanova star as Bojan Bogdanovic, Fischer said.

     Summary: The Cleveland Cavaliers have a trade asset in Caris LeVert.
The Cleveland Cavaliers are going to make a trade, or at least try to, over the coming weeks.
The trade deadline is fast approaching the Cavs are a bit light on strong two-way small forwards at the moment.
Another wing player that the Cavs have trotted out hoping for some sort of relief is Caris LeVert.
Caris Levert isn’t a problem for the Cleveland Cavaliers, he’s just not a fitI didn’t like the LeVert trade because it meant losing Ricky Rubio.

The Cavaliers are indeed a Bogdanovic suitor, sources said, but it will be rather difficult, and perhaps impossible, for Cleveland to reach Detroit’s lofty asking price for the veteran sharpshooter.Source: Jake Fischer @ Yahoo!

     Fischer’s Latest: Cavs, LeVert, Crowder, Okoro, Bogdanovic, More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cavaliers would love to add a defensive-minded wing who is also a consistent shooting threat, but doing so won’t be easy, writes Jake Fischer of Yahoo Sports.
After acquiring Donovan Mitchell in the offseason, Cleveland no longer has any first-round picks available to trade, so landing a wing would probably require the club to move Caris LeVert and another rotation player, which isn’t an appealing prospect.
Fischer names Tobias Harris and Jae Crowder as a couple veterans who would make sense for the Cavaliers from an on-court perspective.
As the Cavs consider what sort of impact any potential target might have, LeVert will be the “comparative barometer,” says Fischer.
Here’s more from Fischer’s latest story:

     How could the Cavs improve? By adding a quality wing, but that won’t be easy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is one obvious positional upgrade on the wing that has been staring at Cleveland decision-makers for some time.
The Cavaliers sent Ricky Rubio and a protected first-round pick to acquire Caris LeVert at last year’s trade deadline.
LeVert represented Cleveland’s primary trade target last season, and the Cavaliers value his high-character presence in the locker room.
Knicks officials were bracing for Cleveland to select Obi Toppin fifth in that draft, sources said, before the Cavs surprised several rivals by choosing Okoro out of Auburn.
He is considered a diligent worker, and Okoro has a strong desire to remain in Cleveland, sources told Yahoo Sports, to continue growing around the young core this front office has assembled.
