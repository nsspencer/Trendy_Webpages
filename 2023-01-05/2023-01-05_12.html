     A silver lining for House Speaker election: Freedom for C-SPAN
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The failure to elect a Speaker so far in the House has one silver lining, at least for TV viewers.
C-SPAN, the public service network that televises congressional proceedings and other matters, has full freedom to focus on whatever its camera operators find interesting — for the moment.
But on Tuesday and Wednesday, with everything in flux, C-SPAN camera operators have been able to pick up far more interesting details.
Explaining the situation online, CSPAN Capitol Hill producer Craig Caplan tweeted Wednesday:“C-SPAN was given permission to be in the House chamber for opening day of 118th Congress including the Speaker election last yr by Speaker Pelosi.
“Lawmakers would be wise to allow them permanently if they want better ratings.”“It is such a shame that [C-SPAN] does not ALWAYS control the cameras in the House chamber.

     Why C-SPAN’s Camera Work Is Suddenly So Interesting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the first time ever, independent media cameras are capturing a contentious, unscripted political fight on the House floor.
“You’re able to see the migrating scrums of Congressmen on the House floor as they negotiate with each other.
For House proceedings, footage is captured by the House Recording Studio and broadcast by C-SPAN.
“C-SPAN’s request is for the addition of a few small robotically-operated cameras in the House chamber.” Its requests have always been denied.
For all of O’Connell’s 22 years at C-SPAN, they’ve been the pool camera crews for the speaker vote.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For three days now, America has been addicted to a new TV show playing out before our eyes: The U.S. House of Representatives on C-SPAN.
“I don’t recall the last time I have seen C-SPAN mentioned on Twitter with this frequency.
I’m not sure it’s ever happened before.”Indeed, C-SPAN has been ubiquitous this week.
“Watching McCarthy work Rep. Andrew Clyde is C-SPAN at its no-rules best,” said veteran D.C. journalist Jonathan Allen.
), viewers may yearn for the freedom they are getting from the C-SPAN journalists this week even more.

     C-SPAN is having a moment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Usually, the House forbids independent media coverage of proceedings, meaning that networks must rely on a government feed for coverage.
But when there are special events taking place in the House, such as the election for speaker, independent coverage is allowed.
In this case, that translates to C-SPAN deploying multiple cameras of its own into the House chamber, giving the public a rare front row view of the high-stakes negotiations between lawmakers.
For example, C-SPAN’s cameras showed Republican Rep. Paul Gosar, who has voted against Kevin McCarthy for speaker, on the floor speaking Tuesday with Democratic Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez.
You don’t see that during standard coverage.”O’Connell noted that C-SPAN would like to be able to do this far more often.

#118thCongress pic.twitter.com/VCQgi0bgLA — CSPAN (@cspan) January 5, 2023The endless floor votes sparked their own routines as members chimed in alphabetically, from Alma Adams of North Carolina to Ryan Zinke of Montana.
It was simply the result of Oklahoma representative Tom Cole moving into the suite reserved for the chair of the House Rules Committee and using it to enjoy a smoke or two or ten.
