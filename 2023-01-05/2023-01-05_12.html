     GOP member appears to charge Gaetz amid late-night speaker hold-up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Mike Rogers appeared to charge Rep. Matt Gaetz on the House floor on Friday night, after a 14th failed ballot for House speaker.
The Alabama Republican had to be pulled away from Mr. Gaetz after he seemed visibly heated over the Florida member’s resistance to support GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, aiding the ongoing stalemate on Capitol Hill.
Someone in the chamber shouted “keep it civil!” as the Republicans seemed to be having a heated exchange.
Mr. Gaetz is one of several Republican holdouts preventing Mr. McCarthy from securing the gavel through 14 votes over four days.
He changed his vote to “present” for the 14th and 15th ballots.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Saks., had to be held back by one of his colleagues after confronting Rep. Matt Gaetz during the contentious 14th vote for U.S. House speaker Friday night.
Gaetz voted “present” in the 14th vote McCarthy lost in his speaker bid.
The 14th vote ended without McCarthy becoming speaker -- this time just one vote shy of being elected.
McCarthy then appeared to speak with Gaetz and walked off when Rogers lunged at Gaetz before being restrained by Hudson.
The Alabama congressman previously “promised” to ban any Republican members who don’t vote McCarthy speaker from sitting on committees.

     Speaker farce: Mike Rogers and Matt Gaetz nearly come to blows on House floor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL) nearly came to blows with Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) as frustrations exploded on Friday night in the House of Representatives, with the 14th ballot for speaker leaving Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) one vote short.
He was seen walking toward Gaetz before the vote was gaveled in, appearing to ask for his help, but Gaetz did not change his vote.
CSPAN has been given free rein with its cameras due to the lack of a rules package as the speaker fight rages on.
“When we come back tonight, we'll have the votes to get this done once and for all,” McCarthy said while exiting the House chamber Friday afternoon.
“It just reminds me of what my father always told me: It's not about how you start.
