     Summary: Russell Westbrook had message for fans with his outfit after Lakers winDon’t look now, but Russell Westbrook has gotten his swagger back.
The Los Angeles Lakers guard Westbrook had one of his best games of the year on Wednesday against the Miami Heat.
Westbrook had 21 points, eight rebounds, and nine assists in 36 minutes off the bench.
!pic.twitter.com/GfLR2y3LzN — Italo Santana (@BulletClubIta) January 5, 2023After the game, Westbrook had his session with reporters while wearing a hat with an interesting message.
But you have to give credit to Westbrook for doing the unthinkable in more ways than one this year.

     Report: Lakers had dreams of recreating Heat’s Big 3 by acquiring Russell Westbrook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Lakers acquired point guard Russell Westbrook in the summer of 2021 in hopes that he would be able to help the team return to title contention.
Of course, that didn’t happen last season as Westbrook and the Lakers endured a rough campaign and missed out on the postseason altogether.
Naturally, many people thought a Big 3 of Westbrook, LeBron James and Anthony Davis would make the Lakers the team to beat in the Western Conference.
The team apparently thought that it could recreate the Miami Heat’s iconic Big 3, which consisted of James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.
Davis and James have been in and out of the lineup this season, and that has made it hard for the Lakers to be consistent.

     Lakers' Russell Westbrook: Probable for Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Westbrook (foot) is listed as probable for Friday's contest against the Hawks, Dan Woike of the Los Angeles Times reports.
After nearly recording a triple-double in Wednesday's win against the Heat, the veteran guard felt soreness in his left foot Thursday, leading the Lakers to tab Westbrook as probable for Friday.
Expect the guard to play Friday barring any major setbacks.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Winning a title with only two stars never deterred him from his belief and, eventually, Russell Westbrook became that guy.
Interestingly, it was that Miami model that the Lakers were aiming for when they traded for Westbrook.
But Dwyane Wade was a much better defender from the beginning to the end than Russell Westbrook has been...
This version of Westbrook is the Dwyane Wade you order on Wish.
As much pressure as Klutch may have put on the front office to make a deal, Pelinka had the final say regardless.
