     Summary: HOUSTON -- Lauri Markkanen scored a career-high 49 points to lead the Utah Jazz to a 131-114 victory over the Houston Rockets on Thursday night that snapped a five-game skid.
Markkanen got out to a quick start with 18 points in the first quarter to help the Jazz to an early lead.
Houston took the lead late in the third quarter, but Utah ended that quarter on a 10-0 run to go on top for good.
Jordan Clarkson hit a 3-pointer soon after that before a tip shot by Markkanen extended the lead to 117-107.
Coach Stephen Silas was disappointed in how many times the Rockets sent Markkanen to the line.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The last time Lauri Markkanen was on the floor he was a split-second away from delivering a truly remarkable buzzer-beater.
Having apparently learned his lesson, he made sure not to leave anything to chance on Thursday night against the Houston Rockets.
"Obviously he's shown the ability to shoot the ball, but I think the physicality he's played with -- driving the ball, the physicality he's played with as a screener, has given him an opportunity to score in a variety of ways.
Any time you see guys have big scoring nights in the NBA, a lot of times there's a lot of free throws involved in that."
After his career night he's putting up 24.5 points and 8.4 rebounds per game on 53.0/42.2/87.7 shooting splits.
