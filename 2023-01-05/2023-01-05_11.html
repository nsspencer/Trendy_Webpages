     Knicks 117, Spurs 114: You knew what was coming — The Strickland: A New York Knicks Site Guaranteed To Make 'Em Jump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been a while since the Knicks’ best player also measured up as a follow-my-lead leader.
Carmelo Anthony’s vibe was mostly points, becoming a digital athlete and then everything else, in that order.
But listen to the roar of the crowd for that one play, so early in the game against a team no one cares about.
As for the new hardwiring, dig this: after Brunson’s miss and turnover, the Knicks were down two.
That uncertainty is a helluva better vibe than viewing those games as a couple of Ls.

     Summary: Jan 4, 2023; New York, New York, USA; New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson (11) reacts during the fourth quarter against the San Antonio Spurs at Madison Square Garden.
Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsAfter barely squeezing past the San Antonio Spurs, the Knicks are now 21-18 on the season.
Considering how bad the Spurs have been this year, this game was closer than it should have been.
Not only was Brunson cooking all game, but he hit some big-time shots down the stretch to help the Knicks pull away from the pesky Spurs.
The starters have looked absolutely fantastic recently and have been the sole reason the Knicks have been winning.

     Is it possible to leave Donovan Mitchell-Knicks trade what-ifs in 2022?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Knicks fans went from analyzing Donovan Mitchell’s possible fit in NYC to being haunted by his name that will forever be associated with their favorite team.
Here we are four months later, and the ‘what ifs’ surrounding Donovan Mitchell and the Knicks have gotten old.
Was it really worth holding onto RJ Barrett and passing on Donovan Mitchell, who is having a far better year than Barrett?
Donovan Mitchell isn’t set to be a free agent until the 2026 offseason and there’s a lot that can change between now and then.
The bottom line is that New York didn’t trade for Donovan Mitchell.

Stephen A. Smith went on an epic tirade after being reminded about losing Donovan Mitchell to the Cavaliers following Mitchell’s breakout performance.

I wanted Donovan Mitchell, but you didn’t get Donovan Mitchell.
And Donovan Mitchell, who wanted to be in New York, who’s from New York, who expected to be when the New York Knicks uniform dropped in 71 points.

     Summary: “The injury was so traumatic and sort of demonized the game,” Fields said.
“I would’ve thought I’d still be playing at age 34,” Fields said the week before his latest promotion.
Landry Fields’ commitment to “doing the little things” earned him a starting role as a rookie with the Knicks during the 2010-11 season.
As a rookie, Fields averaged 31 minutes per game.
“I don’t put as much stock into it as I did as a player,” Fields said.
