"RHOBH" star Denise Richards also called out Rinna after the Season 12 reunion, writing on Instagram, “I watched #RHOBH last night.
While I have empathy for Lisa Rinna losing her mom, what is her excuse all the other years on the show for being so cruel &amp; so vindictive?”Rinna's mother, Lois Rinna, died in November 2021 at age 93.
After news of her departure broke on Jan. 5, Rinna's former costar Lisa Vanderpump seemingly shaded her on Twitter, writing simply "Ding dong."

     She Owned It! Lisa Rinna Will Not Be Returning to ‘The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a grisly season — marred especially by the death of her mother, Lois — Lisa Rinna will not be returning to “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” People magazine broke the news, and Variety has confirmed her exit with Rinna’s publicist.
(In Dave Quinn’s 2021 oral history of “The Real Housewives” franchise, “Not All Diamonds and Rosé: The Inside Story of The Real Housewives from the People Who Lived It,” Rinna claimed that Lisa Vanderpump had been behind the Munchausen theory, which Vanderpump has denied.)
Yet Rinna’s lashings-out weren’t fun or entertaining “Real Housewives” fodder; instead, they came across as ungenerous and desperate.
According to Rinna, Hilton verbally decimated the whole cast, member by member, with her ire especially directed at her own sister, OG cast member Kyle Richards.
Back in Los Angeles, during a scene at Richards’ house with Hilton and Rinna, Hilton apologized for her behavior: But only to a point.
