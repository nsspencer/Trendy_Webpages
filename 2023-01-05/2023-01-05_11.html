     What the Epiphany Teaches Us About Political Hatred
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The word epiphany itself doesn’t have anything to do with gift-giving.
On the contrary, we’re told the magi return to their own land and, presumably, to their roles as astronomers and priests.
The other significant character in Matthew’s tale is King Herod, the local Judean ruler, a puppet of the Romans.
Traditionally this slaughter is known as the massacre of the Holy Innocents, still a holy day in many Christian calendars.
They are more like King Herod than the Three Kings.

     The Epiphany of the Lord: Looking for love
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Imaginative versions of the story of the pilgrims who sought the Christ child are generally fairly romantic and formulaic.
When the pilgrims sought the wisdom of Israel, the religious leaders cited prophecies while remaining tragically incurious about their implications for their own time.
Unlike the lackeys who theologized for Herod, the Magi were genuine religious pilgrims, people willing to cross physical and intellectual borders.
Today's feast day is called the Epiphany of the Lord.
Johnny Lee's song describes the wrong places he'd sought love.
