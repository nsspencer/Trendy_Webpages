     Summary: A rising star in Connecticut politics dies in a collision with a wrong-way driverEnlarge this image toggle caption Brian O'Connor/AP Brian O'Connor/APHARTFORD, Conn. — A Connecticut state representative, considered a rising political star, was killed when a wrong-way driver crashed head-on into his vehicle early Thursday morning as he returned home from the governor's inauguration ball, state police said.
But after news of Williams' death, legislative leaders announced they had closed the state Capitol and Legislative Office Building, postponing all legislative activities until Monday.
Authorities identified the wrong-way driver as Kimede Mustafaj, 27, of Manchester, Connecticut, who also died in the collision.
"He was incredibly proud of his education, Middletown High School and him being able to succeed and graduate from college and then go on to graduate school," Lesser said.
Lesser recalled Williams expressing to him an interest in running for statewide office or Congress some day.
