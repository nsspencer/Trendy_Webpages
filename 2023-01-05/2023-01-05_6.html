     Summary: January 5, 2023 at 3:03 PM ESTPep Guardiola’s ongoing quest to adjust Manchester City’s game plan to Erling Haaland’s arrival continues at Stamford Bridge.
“Many times in the past few seasons we played with a false 9, so the extra man was in the middle.
Now the extra man is in the box, so we have to adjust a little bit,” he said shortly before kick-off.
Tonight, Phil Foden gets the nod, much to the delight of fans.
After the draw against Everton, fans wanted to see a change and tonight they’ve got it.
