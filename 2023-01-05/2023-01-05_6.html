     Summary: Amazon layoffs to reach 18,000 employees totalAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.
An earlier report said that layoffs would reach around 10,000 employees by the time Amazon was done.
However, a new report by the Wall Street Journal, citing Amazon itself, says that total is set to exceed 18,000 in the coming weeks.
Amazon's 18,000 laid-off employees will represent the highest number of people let go by a tech company in recent months.
So far, Wall Street is not impressed.

     Amazon layoffs top 18K as AWS growth slows
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dive Brief:Following a review of its operations, Amazon is laying off more employees in its retail business, CEO Andy Jassy told employees Wednesday.
In all, including layoffs confirmed in November, Amazon will “eliminate just over 18,000 roles,” primarily in its Amazon Stores, and People, Experience and Technology divisions, according to Jassy’s blog post.
What is adding up to be a significant number of layoffs signals a correction to the company’s over-expansion as the pandemic helped fuel online sales growth.
The November layoffs accompanied a pause in hiring at AWS, the company’s reliably profitable cloud division.
More than 1,000 tech companies, including Meta and Microsoft, laid off over 150,000 employees in 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, even as demand for tech talent has remained high in other sectors.

     Amazon cutting total of 18,000 workers as tech layoffs mount
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon said it is slashing a total of 18,000 jobs, a larger number of positions than it previously announced and the largest set of layoffs in the e-commerce giant's history.
Jassy said the layoffs will mostly impact the company's brick-and-mortar stores, which include Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and its PXT organizations, which handle human resources and other functions.
In November, he told staff the layoffs were coming due to the economic landscape and the company's rapid hiring in the last several years.
Amazon, which has a total global workforce of 1.5 million, is one of a number of major tech companies shedding workers after hiring aggressively in recent years.
Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Netflix, Peloton, Twitter and other tech companies have announced sizable layoffs or scaled back hiring in recent months amid weakening economic growth.

     The end of ‘everything’ at Amazon: Record layoffs signal new mindset for sprawling tech giant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a memo to employees, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company will apply its “Invent and Simplify” leadership principle not just to products but to its own organization.
That was the message to Amazon employees Wednesday from Andy Jassy, signaling a shift in mindset with significant implications for the company’s future.
The 18,000-person layoff is the largest in Amazon’s history and, in raw numbers, the biggest by any tech company in the past year.
“Simplify, simplify, simplify!”So what does this mean at Amazon, in practice?
It’s just one of the ways Amazon’s past approach might not match its new reality.

     Amazon to cut 18,000 jobs as layoffs expand in tech sector
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jan 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) layoffs will now include more than 18,000 roles as part of a workforce reduction it previously disclosed, Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in a public staff note on Wednesday.
The layoff decisions, which Amazon will communicate starting Jan. 18, will largely impact the company's e-commerce and human resources organizations, he said.
Amazon has more than 1.5 million workers including warehouse staff, making it America's second-largest private employer after Walmart Inc (WMT.N).
Jassy's note followed a report in the Wall Street Journal that the reduction would be more than 17,000 jobs.
Amazon still must file certain legal notices about mass layoffs, and it plans to pay severance.
