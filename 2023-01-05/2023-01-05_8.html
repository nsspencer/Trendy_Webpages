     Nikola Jokic, Nuggets has Charles Barkley tooting his own horn
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is exactly why Denver Nuggets fans might be worried by Chuck‚Äôs latest (semi) guarantee.
After seeing Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets destroy the Los Angeles Clippers in the first half of their matchup on Thursday night (Denver entered the half with a massive 34-point lead), Barkley was out tooting his own horn.
‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre the deepest team in the NBA.
They got everything.‚Äù"I think they're the deepest team in the NBA.
What the Nuggets need to take it to the next level would be Jamal Murray to recapture his old form ‚Äî at least according to Chuck.

     Clippers vs. Nuggets prediction and odds for Thursday, January 5 (Trust Denver at home)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nuggets vs. Timberwolves prediction and odds for Monday, January 2 (Denver wins again) by Peter DeweyThe Denver Nuggets are looking to hold on to the top spot in the Western Conference when they host the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night in Denver.
Denver is one of the best teams in the NBA at home, going 14-3 straight up this season.
Right now, Denver is a five-point favorite, but this line could move if George is out of the lineup.
The Clippers have been struggling, and losing George would certainly hurt the team‚Äôs offense, which ranks 27th in the NBA.
That‚Äôs where I see the advantage for Denver, as the team has been elite on offense, especially at home.
