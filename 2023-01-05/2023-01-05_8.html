     Mexico Arrests Son of ‘El Chapo’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Guzman, one of the sons of incarcerated drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, was captured early Thursday in Culiacan, in the Sinaloa state, and transferred to Mexico City, Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval told reporters.
Security, and particularly the flow of drugs from Mexico into the U.S., is on the agenda.
He was released by the Mexican government after his capture in October 2019 led to widespread violence across Culiacan.
Flights coming in and out of the Culiacan airport were suspended Thursday, but airport facilities remained “secure” and under the control of the National Guard and the Defense Ministry, operator OMA said.
Aeromexico reported flight cancellations to and from Los Mochis airport and said one of its planes was hit by a bullet at the Culiacan airport.

     Why is Ovidio Guzmán one of Mexico’s most wanted men?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MEXICO CITY — Mexican security forces on Thursday arrested cartel leader Ovidio Guzmán, son of incarcerated kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzmán, the country’s defense minister said.
Guzmán, nicknamed “The Mouse,” became a high-level leader in the Sinaloa Cartel after his father’s arrest in 2016 and extradition in 2017.
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador months later said he personally ordered Guzmán’s release to protect the population.
While López Obrador took office in 2018 promising to trade a hard-on-crime security approach for one that tackles the root causes of violence, homicides are near record levels.
Guzmán’s arrest Thursday could signal the government is willing and able to stand up to them.

     Summary: Violence hits a Mexico cartel stronghold as the son of 'El Chapo' is capturedEnlarge this image toggle caption Martin Urista/AP Martin Urista/APMEXICO CITY — The sun wasn't yet up in Culiacan when David Téllez and his family began making their way to the city's airport for a return flight to Mexico after their vacation.
Téllez pressed on trying to get his family back to Mexico City, circumventing several more abandoned vehicles blocking roads and eventually making it to the airport.
He said that request would have to be updated and processed, but he added that first an open case in Mexico awaits Guzmán.
At Culiacan's airport, a Mexican military flight was able to spirit Guzmán away to Mexico City.
Asked if the attempt to capture Guzmán was worth another day of tension and uncertainty in Culiacan, Téllez said, "If they caught him, it was worth it."

     Mexico captures son of 'El Chapo' sparking wave of violence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [1/6] Burning vehicles are seen blocking a road after drug lord Ovidio Guzman's capture, in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico January 5, 2023.
The United States had offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Ovidio's arrest or conviction.
Joaquin Guzman, 65, was convicted in New York in 2019 of trafficking billions of dollars of drugs to the United States and conspiring to murder enemies.
Eduardo Guerrero, director of Lantia Consulting which analyzes Mexican organized crime, said pressure from the Biden administration to target the Sinaloa Cartel had likely motivated Mexico to go after Guzman.
"It's very important the government bear in mind that the weakening of the Sinaloa Cartel may also bring about an even greater expansion, a greater presence of the Jalisco Cartel."

     Summary: Mexican officials denied that the raid was politically motivated.
Mexico has become the principal supplier of fentanyl to the United States, overtaking China in 2019, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.
AdvertisementOne former DEA official said that if the alleged trafficker was extradited to the United States, he could provide crucial intelligence on fentanyl trafficking.
(Video: Reuters)Moments after they arrested him, criminal groups launched a counterattack, throwing up roadblocks and engaging in shootouts with authorities in 19 parts of Culiacán, officials said.
One DEA agent said Thursday’s detention of Guzmán could cause some slowdown in shipments of fentanyl and meth to the United States as the cartel recalibrated.
