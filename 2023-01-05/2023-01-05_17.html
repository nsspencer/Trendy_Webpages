     How to celebrate Three Kings Day around Connecticut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boonyachoat/Getty Images/iStockphotoThree Kings Day on Jan. 6 celebrates the Three Wise Men, who are said in the Book of Matthew to have journeyed on the backs of camels to the town of Bethlehem (in present-day Palestine) to meet the newborn Jesus Christ.
Once they reached their destination they presented the baby with gifts of expensive frankincense, myrrh and gold.
To mirror the actions of the Three Wise Men, who were named Melchior, Caspar and Balthazar, several events around Connecticut are held on or near Jan. 6, during which individuals dress up as kings and give gifts to children.

     What Is Three Kings Day and How Is It Celebrated?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the twelfth day of Christmas, Three Kings Day or Día de Los Reyes is celebrated.
What Is Three Kings Day?
Three Kings Day or Epiphany is celebrated by Roman Catholics on Jan. 6, as the culmination of the 12 days of Christmas.
Although the birth of Jesus is celebrated on Christmas Day, the three Kings didn't actually reach him until twelve days later—which is why Three Kings Day is celebrated on the 12th day of Christmas.
Three Kings Day parades also take place around the world from New York City to Madrid and Uruguay.
