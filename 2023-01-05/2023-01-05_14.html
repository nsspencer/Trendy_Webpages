     Kyrie Irving Signs Autographs, Takes Pics With Fans Outside Hotel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Play video content TMZSports.comKyrie Irving showed appreciation for fans eager to meet him in Chicago this week ... by signing autographs and taking pics with a big crowd of supporters.
TMZ Sports is told ... Irving embraced the impromptu meet-and-greet and spent a moment with everyone in the crowd right outside the Nets' team hotel in the Windy City.
In the video, you can see Irving swarmed as he was presumably on his way to the team bus ... with the mob of fans handing the star point guard various items to sign.
As it turns out, we're told there was a group of Irving fans waiting outside the same hotel on Wednesday, and Kyrie promised that if they returned Thursday, he would stay and interact with as many people as time permitted.
The Nets have been clicking on all cylinders since Kyrie returned from his suspension on Nov. 20 against Memphis ... reasserting themselves as a powerhouse in the East.

     Anti-Semitism thrives as Kyrie Irving avoids his role in its spread
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unfortunately, much of the pushback so far treats the problem of anti-Semitism like an issue for classroom discussion, curable by tackling ignorance and rudeness.
A few weeks ago, Brooklyn Nets point guard Kyrie Irving (inset) returned to the basketball court after his eight-game suspension for promoting the anti-Semitic film “Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America” — and initially refusing to denounce anti-Semitism.
In fact, Irving has neither apologized for any unintended incitement nor even acknowledged the phenomenon of growing animosity and violence toward Jews — especially among American blacks.
Nothing that Irving has said or done since has stopped “Hebrews to Negroes” from becoming the best-selling book in multiple Amazon categories or delegitimized its hateful message.
Anti-Semitism, however, is an age-old malignancy that leapfrogs bias to become something irrational, suffused with magical thinking and the potential for violence.
