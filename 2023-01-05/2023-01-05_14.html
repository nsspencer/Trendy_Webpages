Markkanen got out to a quick start with 18 points in the first quarter to help the Jazz to an early lead.
Houston took the lead late in the third quarter, but Utah ended that quarter on a 10-0 run to go on top for good.
Jordan Clarkson hit a 3-pointer soon after that before a tip shot by Markkanen extended the lead to 117-107.
Coach Stephen Silas was disappointed in how many times the Rockets sent Markkanen to the line.

     The Triple Team: Lauri Markkanen scores 49 points vs. Rockets â€” more than any regular-season Jazz player in 30 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lauri Markkanen almost scored 50 pointsLauri Markkanen scored 49 points on Thursday night, the most any Jazz player has scored in the regular season since Karl Maloneâ€™s scoring prime in 1990.
Markkanen has proven that the Jazz already have one more All-Star than they thought they had.
Tonightâ€™s a good example: 0 of his 49 points tonight came from isolation, in post-ups, or as the pick-and-roll ball-handler.
Like here, the Rockets try to guard him with a small dude, and Markkanen can just roll to the rim and finish.
Markkanen had previously only taken over 10 free throws twice this season; heâ€™s now taken 12, 15, and 13 in his last three games.
