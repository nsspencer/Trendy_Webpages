     Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow not running for reelection
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow announced Thursday that she will not seek reelection in 2024 in Michigan.
The agriculture panel’s top Democrat since 2011, Stabenow has a reputation as a tenacious negotiator willing to spend hours sounding out colleagues on their priorities.
In farm bill legislation, Stabenow has juggled lawmakers' regional priorities for traditional commodity crops and goals for giving organic farmers, fruit and vegetable producers and urban growers more access to Agriculture Department programs.
This includes leading the passage of the next five-year Farm Bill which determines our nation’s food and agriculture policies,” Stabenow said in a statement.
“It is also key in protecting our land and water and creating jobs in our rural and urban communities.”

I am announcing today that I will not seek re-election and will leave the U.S. Senate at the end of my term on January 3, 2025.

Women hold the top three statewide elected offices, and we have the first female Majority Leader in the State Senate!

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington CNN —Sen. Debbie Stabenow will not seek reelection in 2024, the longtime Michigan Democrat said Thursday, opening up a Senate seat in a key swing state.
Stabenow, who previously served in the Michigan state House and state Senate, first won election to Congress in 1996, winning a swing seat in Central Michigan.
“No one embodies the true Michigan spirit more than Debbie Stabenow,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.
A spokesperson for Senate Democrats’ campaign arm expressed confidence Thursday in holding Stabenow’s seat.
“In 2022, Michigan Democrats won resounding statewide victories, and we are confident Democrats will hold this Senate seat in 2024,” David Bergstein of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said in a statement.

     Within hours of Debbie Stabenow announcing her retirement, Dems are scrambling to replace her
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stabenow declined to say if she’s spoken with Buttigieg about the seat.
Garlin Gilchrist, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel — could all be well-placed for a Senate run, as well as Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow, who rocketed to national prominence in 2021 for a speech she made on the state Senate floor and built an impressive online donor base, has also been floated as a potential candidate.
But GOP operatives in the state said they were hopeful they can avoid a cantankerous contest to fill Stabenow’s seat.
“I don’t see them behaving like [the] Ohio Senate primary,” said Jason Cabel Roe, a Michigan-based Republican consultant, citing the 2022 Ohio Senate primary, when the race devolved into a battle for Trump’s endorsement.
