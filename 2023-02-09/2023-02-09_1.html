     Summary: Sen. John Fetterman went to the hospital Wednesday evening after feeling “lightheaded,” his office said in a statement.
Fetterman (D-Pa.), who suffered a stroke last May, left the Senate Democratic retreat on Wednesday and called his staff, who drove him to The George Washington University Hospital in Washington.
While initial tests did not show signs of a new stroke, doctors are continuing to run tests, and Fetterman was being kept overnight “for observation,” his office said.
“He is in good spirits and talking with his staff and family,” his office said.
“We will provide more information when we have it.”

     John Fetterman hospitalized after "feeling lightheaded" during Senate retreat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was hospitalized Wednesday after "feeling lightheaded" while on a Senate Democratic retreat in Washington D.C., his office announced.
Fetterman was driven by his staff to George Washington University Hospital, his office said in a statement late Wednesday night.
The 53-year-old Fetterman, then Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, suffered a stoke in May during his Senate campaign, and underwent surgery to implant a pacemaker.
Despite his health struggles, Fetterman still went on to defeat Oz, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, in November.
His win over Oz helped Democrats grow their majority in the Senate from 50 to 51 seats.
