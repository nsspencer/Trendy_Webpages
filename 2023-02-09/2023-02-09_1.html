     Summary: Sen. John Fetterman spends the night in the hospital after feeling lightheadedEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty ImagesOne night after attending the State of the Union address with other members of Congress, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., spent last night in the hospital.
His office says Fetterman reported feeling lightheaded on Wednesday, and was kept overnight for observation.
Fetterman was at a Senate Democratic retreat when he started feeling unwell, his communications director, Joe Calvello, said in a statement to journalists.
"He left and called his staff, who picked him up and drove him to the George Washington University Hospital," Calvello said.
"Initial tests did not show evidence of a new stroke," Calvello said, but doctors wanted to run more tests and keep the senator in their care overnight.

     John Fetterman hospitalized after "feeling lightheaded" during Senate retreat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was hospitalized Wednesday after "feeling lightheaded" while on a Senate Democratic retreat in Washington D.C., his office announced.
Fetterman was driven by his staff to George Washington University Hospital, his office said in a statement late Wednesday night.
The 53-year-old Fetterman, then Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, suffered a stoke in May during his Senate campaign, and underwent surgery to implant a pacemaker.
Despite his health struggles, Fetterman still went on to defeat Oz, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, in November.
His win over Oz helped Democrats grow their majority in the Senate from 50 to 51 seats.

     Sen. John Fetterman Hospitalized After Feeling Lightheaded
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, who had a stroke during his campaign last year, has been hospitalized after feeling lightheaded while attending a Democratic retreat, his office said.
In November, Fetterman, 53, won the seat held by now-retired Republican Pat Toomey after a hard-fought contest against GOP nominee Mehmet Oz.
Fetterman, who was the lieutenant governor, defeated the celebrity heart surgeon by 5 percentage points, flipping a seat that was key to Democrats holding the Senate majority.
More than $300 million was spent during the campaign, making it the most expensive Senate race in 2022.
As a result of the stroke, Fetterman has struggled with auditory processing disorder, a common aftereffect that can can leave a person unable to speak fluidly and quickly process spoken conversation into meaning.
