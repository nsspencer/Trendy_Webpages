     Summary: Tesla recalls nearly 363,000 cars with 'Full Self-Driving' to fix flaws in behaviorEnlarge this image toggle caption Ben Margot/AP Ben Margot/APDETROIT — Tesla is recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles with its "Full Self-Driving" system to fix problems with the way it behaves around intersections and following posted speed limits.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says in documents posted Thursday that Tesla will fix the concerns with an online software update in the coming weeks.
The documents say Tesla is doing the recall but does not agree with an agency analysis of the problem.
Tesla has received 18 warranty claims that could be caused by the software from May of 2019 through Sept. 12, 2022.
"As required by law and after discussions with NHTSA, Tesla launched a recall to repair those defects," the agency said.

     Summary: Tesla is issuing a software upgrade to over 362,000 versions of its Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y vehicles because those with its full self-driving beta software may be "unsafe around intersections," according to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report.
The recall also noted the system may not respond sufficiently to changes in posted speed limits or not account for the driver's adjustment of the vehicle's speed to exceed speed limits.

     Tesla’s Recall Targets a ‘Fundamental’ Flaw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After years selling its controversial Full-Self Driving software upgrade for thousands of dollars, Tesla today issued a recall for every one of the nearly 363,000 vehicles using the feature.
Drivers will be able to continue to use the feature as Tesla builds a software patch for the defects.
Humans do not work that way, says Philip Koopman, who studies self-driving car safety as an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University.
The car is designed to buzz and beep when it determines that the human driver needs to take over.
The probe looked into why vehicles using Tesla’s Autopilot feature have a history of colliding with stationary first responder vehicles.

     Tesla recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles equipped with ‘Full Self-Driving’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York CNN —Tesla is recalling all 363,000 US vehicles with its so-called “Full Self Driving” driver assist software due to safety risks, another blow to the feature that is central to the automaker’s business model.
Tesla will attempt to fix the the FSD feature, which costs $15,000, through an over-the-air software update, the notice added.
A Troubled DevelopmentFSD is considered key to the company’s basic business plan, given the premiums that drivers pay for the features, and it’s ability to attract buyers to chose Tesla cars in the first place.
So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.”But other safety experts have questioned the validity of Tesla’s safety claims.
There have been high-profile accidents of Tesla cars using FSD or its more rudimentary predecessor known as “Autopilot.” Some of those accidents included fatalities.
