     John Wick's Gun-Fu Fighting Style Was Made To Save Time And Money
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: John Wick's Gun-Fu Fighting Style Was Made To Save Time And MoneyThe "John Wick" movies have gone from cult favorites to legitimate blockbusters over the past decade, bolstered by a thrilling form of action design practiced by Keanu Reeves.
The term gun-fu is often used to describe the fight scenes in the John Wick saga, but the style itself didn't start with Baba Yaga.
Perhaps the best example came with 1992's "Hard Boiled," which contains an epic three-minute-long gunfight that, for many, represents the apex of the director's unique style.
And in the process, the first "John Wick" chapter basically birthed an entire subgenre of action films, wherein some aggrieved protagonist reveals their surprisingly preeminent fighting skills while embarking on a mission for revenge.
But rather than being a conscious effort to evolve gun-fu, it seems Stahelski and Leitch developed their form of the style out of necessity.

     John Wick: Chapter 4 final trailer with Keanu Reeves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If there’s one thing the John Wick franchise has taught us, it’s that the titular character (The Matrix Resurrections’s Keanu Reeves) wants one thing and one thing only: freedom.
John will do anything for freedom, as evidenced in the final trailer for John Wick: Chapter 4, even if that means taking down the entire High Table.
Set to Nas’ Got Yourself a Gun, the trailer follows John as he discovers a way to earn his freedom.
Chad Stahelski, who directed the first three John Wick films, returns to direct Chapter 4 from a script written by Shay Hatten (Army of Thieves) and Michael Finch (American Assasin).
John Wick: Chapter 4 is in theaters and IMAX on March 24.

     Does 'John Wick' Spinoff 'The Continental' Have A Backstory?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is, in theory, no such thing as too much John Wick.
There is nothing that can make John Wick stop (unless Reeves himself decides he needs a little break in which case that’s what he deserves).
But John Wick, as a concept and entity, is forever.
And the universe is expanding with the upcoming John Wick 4 and the introduction of The Continental, the upcoming series based on the hit franchise.
Kevin Beggs, Lionsgate Television chairman, told Deadline in 2021 that the series would lay the foundation of the movie series.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s unclear whether we’ll be getting a fifth John Wick installment, so we’d better savor all the bloody battles, bullet barrages, and biting one-liners the franchise gives us in the upcoming John Wick: Chapter 4.
Our second look at Chapter 4 is less concerned with closing chapters and more with opening fire.
Yen’s character also narrates a short section of the trailer, saying, “The only way John Wick will ever have freedom and peace is in death.” (Director Chad Stahelski hyped up a fight between Yen’s character and legendary Japanese action star Hiroyuki Sanada in an interview with Collider.)
The fourth entry in Wick world will be the longest in franchise history, clocking in at an Avatar-ian two hours and 49 minutes.
Whether it’s horror or action or comedy, you’re seeing a face that’s, you know, 20 feet tall.” If this new trailer is any indication the fourth John Wick is a movie best experienced in the largest, loudest screening room possible.

The trailer takes John all across the world for new fights, from horse-back brawls to club shootouts, to a little bit of verbal sparring in view of the Eiffel Tower.
