     Don Lemon’s Apology for Nikki Haley Age Remarks Hints at Deeper Tensions at CNN Morning Show
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The premise of a good morning-news show is that it helps viewers wake up with their morning coffee.
“She says people, you know, politicians or something are not in their prime,” Lemon said on the program “Nikki Haley isn’t in her prime, sorry.
In comparison, Fox News Channel’s “Fox &amp; Friends” generated $39.8 million in 2021, while MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” won $33.1 million.
Viewers can come to look upon morning anchors as a sort of substitute family, and on-air squabbling doesn’t create connections.
CNN will continue to serve up a morning show, no matter what happens in the days ahead.

     Summary: “This whole talk about age makes me uncomfortable,” Lemon, 56, told his co-hosts, Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins.
Harlow challenged Lemon, asking whether he was referring to the “prime” ages for bearing children.
… I’m just saying Nikki Haley should be careful about saying that politicians are not in their prime, and they need to be in their prime when they serve.
Because she wouldn’t be in her prime, according to Google or whatever it is.”The backlash quickly lit up social media.
If they make more money, then they should get more money,” Lemon said.

Lemon chimed in, saying Haley was in no position to determine who is in their prime because of her age.
The reference I made to a woman’s “prime” this morning was inartful and irrelevant, as colleagues and loved ones have pointed out, and I regret it.
Nikki Haley isn't in her prime, sorry... when a woman is considered to be in her prime in her 20s and 30s and maybe 40s."

     CNN’s Don Lemon Says Nikki Haley Is Past Her ‘Prime’ At 51—Here’s What Research Says

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN's Don Lemon said Nikki Haley is passed her prime at age 51.
(Photo by John Lamparski/Getty ... [+] Images) Getty ImagesCNN anchor Don Lemon caused a stir on CNN This Morning when he suggested GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley was no longer in her “prime.” Haley is 51.
Sorry, when a woman is considered to be in her prime, is in her 20s and 30s and maybe 40s.”Co-host Poppy Harlow asked Lemon, “Prime for what?” which is the key question.
Since the CNN discussion surrounded politics, a candidate’s prime may be defined by voter preferences.
When women’s bodies are no longer functioning at their peak and women are past their reproductive age, women are thought to be past their prime.

     Nikki Haley calls CNN's Don Lemon a 'sexist middle-aged' anchor after comments about her not being in her prime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Newly announced GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Thursday took aim at CNN anchor Don Lemon after he said she was no longer in her “prime.”“To be clear, I am NOT calling for competency tests for Sexist middle-aged CNN anchors; only for people who make our laws and are 75+,” Haley wrote on Twitter.
Haley, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who is 51, used her candidacy announcement on Wednesday to call for competency tests for politicians over 75 years old, an apparent shot at her only declared opponent, 76-year-old Donald Trump, as well as President Joe Biden, who at 80 is the oldest person to hold the office.
