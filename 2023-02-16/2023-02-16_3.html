     Tiger Woods finishes Genesis Invitational Round 1 with flurry of birdies in PGA Tour return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There were just as many positive and negative takeaways from Tiger Woods’ return to non-major PGA Tour action on Thursday.
The 82-time winner ho-hummed his way around Riviera Country Club near Los Angeles to the tune of a 2-under 69 in the opening round of the 2023 Genesis Invitational and walked off the course T-27.
Five drives were 320 yards or longer, with his longest of the day reaching 338 yards.
Woods then closed his round out the only way he knew how, in style with a third consecutive birdie.
GENESIS INVITATIONAL ROUND 2:Tee times, TV and streaming infoStill recovering from a single-car accident that nearly cost him his leg, Woods walked with ease for most of the round but began to labor a bit down the stretch.

     How to spot one of the biggest golf swing changes Tiger Woods ever made
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But as he got older, stronger in his upper body, and the club got into a position at the top of his swing that was less closed and across the line, his move morphed into a faster, more aggresive motion.
There was less of a pause between the backswing and downswing because it was less reliant on timing overall.
That's the tempo that remains today, and it's one you can spot every time he swings the club.

A second Riviera victory would be his third of the 2022-23 PGA Tour season and his second in his last three starts.
"There's a lot of us that put in quite a few hours on the golf course and off the golf course and doing the right thing to stay physically and mentally fit to keep that level of golf.
Tiger Woods, still the GOATWhew, we got through all the perfunctory stuff and have now arrived at the main event.
"There will come a point in time where I can't do this anymore, but right now I feel like I still can, given the right golf course.

     Tiger Woods playing to win at first tournament in seven months
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —In February 1992, a sprightly 16-year-old golf prodigy by the name of Tiger Woods made his first PGA Tour start at the Riviera Country Club in California.
“If I’m playing in the event, I’m going to try and beat you,” Woods told reporters Tuesday.
Woods’ participation in California this week marks his first official tournament start since The Open Championship in July last year and only his first non-major PGA Tour event since the ZOZO Championship in October 2020.
While he revealed his leg has improved, Woods admitted struggles with his ankle mean prolonged spells of walking remain challenging.
The victory clinched a fifth PGA Tour title for Scheffler, who is excited to go again with the added bonus of Woods on the fairways.
