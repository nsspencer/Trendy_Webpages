     How to spot one of the biggest golf swing changes Tiger Woods ever made
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But as he got older, stronger in his upper body, and the club got into a position at the top of his swing that was less closed and across the line, his move morphed into a faster, more aggresive motion.
There was less of a pause between the backswing and downswing because it was less reliant on timing overall.
That's the tempo that remains today, and it's one you can spot every time he swings the club.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the greatest golfers to ever grace the earth, Tiger Woods also enjoys a stable and private love life off the course.
Nevertheless, the great golfer was injured in a terrible vehicle accident in February 2021, which forced him to forgo playing golf for a year.
Tiger Woods sparked rumors that he was seeing a new person when he was seen cuddling up to a stunning woman on the course.
As he won the Presidents Cup in New Jersey in October 2017, the celebrity was seen being hugged by Erica Herman.
She was once regarded as a "gold digger" who "chased Tiger like a puppy," but now she is recognized for having saved the golfing legend's life.

     Tiger Woods playing to win at first tournament in seven months
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —In February 1992, a sprightly 16-year-old golf prodigy by the name of Tiger Woods made his first PGA Tour start at the Riviera Country Club in California.
“If I’m playing in the event, I’m going to try and beat you,” Woods told reporters Tuesday.
Woods’ participation in California this week will mark his first official tournament start since The Open Championship in July last year and only his first non-major PGA Tour event since the ZOZO Championship in October 2020.
While he revealed his leg has improved, Woods admitted struggles with his ankle mean prolonged spells of walking remain challenging.
Victory clinched a fifth PGA Tour title for Scheffler, who is excited to go again with the added bonus of Woods on the fairways.
