     Suns Among Teams Interested In Kevin Love
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Suns are among the teams interested in Kevin Love if he finalizes a buyout with the Cavaliers, Brian Windhorst of ESPN said in an appearance on Pardon the Interruption (YouTube link).
As Windhorst points out, Love was teammates with Suns president of basketball operations James Jones when Cleveland won its lone championship in 2016, so there’s a connection there.
Love also played with Kevin Durant and Chris Paul on Team USA in 2012, when the Americans went undefeated in the London Olympics.
According to Windhorst, Love requested the buyout due to a lack of playing time, having been a healthy scratch for the past 12 games.
Windhorst wonders if the Cavs will negotiate to try to force Love to join a Western Conference team instead.

     Best Kevin Love destinations after Cavs buyout, ranked
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the departure of most of the Cleveland Cavaliers’ 2016 championship roster, Kevin Love has long been in the middle of trade talks.
Despite the glaring struggles with their campaign, the Golden State Warriors are still the defending champions.
Trading James Wiseman has lessened their options at the big man position so that they will be one squad chasing Kevin Love.
Ironically, Kevin Love swatted Stephen Curry to clinch his first NBA Championship in 2016.
Yes, the defending champs are struggling, but they still have not been dethroned, so Golden State is the best destination for the former UCLA big man.

     Report: Kevin Love discussing possible buyout from Cavaliers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CLEVELAND (AP) — Five-time All-Star forward Kevin Love has discussed the possibility of a contract buyout from the Cleveland Cavaliers after being dropped from the rotation, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Thursday.
Love played well earlier this season before being slowed by a thumb injury.
Love’s situation became cloudier when the team signed veteran forward Danny Green after he became available via buyout.
Last week, Cavaliers president of basketball operations Koby Altman said he had not spoken to Love or his agents about a buyout and expected him to have a contributing role again at some point this season.
Coach J.B. Bickerstaff said something similar earlier this week, complimenting Love on continuing to be a good teammate and leader.

     Kevin Love landing spots: Lakers, Knicks, Warriors, Suns, Heat among teams that make varying levels of sense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NOTE: Everything you're about to read with regard to how Love, specifically as a 3-point shooter, can still provide value is only true if he's healthy.
The Lakers have made just 10.4 3-pointers per game so far this season, the second-lowest mark in the league.
The Knicks could use a shooting big and they have open roster space.
The Knicks are a high-volume 3-point shooting team, but do not confuse that with being a good 3-point shooting team; only six teams connect from deep at a worse percentage.
The Hawks really need 3-point shooting.
