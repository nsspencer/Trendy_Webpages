     Summary: A daytime TV departure: Ryan Seacrest is leaving 'Live with Kelly and Ryan'Enlarge this image toggle caption Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP Richard Shotwell/Invision/APRyan Seacrest is stepping down as co-host of Live with Kelly and Ryan, ending a six-year run alongside Kelly Rippa on the ABC morning show.
"I made the decision to make this my last season as co-host with Kell here on Live with Kelly and Ryan, ... which is bittersweet," Seacrest announced live on Thursday's broadcast, adding that he'd been thinking about the move "for a long time."
Ripa's husband, Mark Consuelos, who is already a fill-in on the show, will replace Seacrest and the program will be rebranded as Live with Kelly and Mark.
The moment was a mutual gush-fest, during which Ryan said he was becoming emotional but that he'd promised Ripa he wouldn't cry.
Despite his imminent departure, audiences will still have plenty of opportunities to get their Seacrest fix.
