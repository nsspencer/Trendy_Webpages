     Brooks Koepka Reportedly ‘Rethinking’ Move To LIV Golf, May Be Looking At A Way To Return To PGA Tour

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Videos by OutKickBrooks Koepka’s move to LIV Golf last year wasn’t necessarily a surprise.
READ: BROOKS KOEPKA TALKS JOINING LIV GOLF AFTER PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE TO PGA TOUR: ‘MY OPINION CHANGED’Koepka, who won the LIV event in Jeddah last year, has “buyer’s remorse” when it comes to joining LIV Golf, according to plugged in golf writer Alan Shipnuck.
(Photo by Jonathan Ferrey/LIV Golf via Getty Images)Given the pending lawsuits involving the PGA Tour, LIV Golf, and the DP World Tour, Koepka can’t just wake up tomorrow, quit LIV, and re-join the Tour.
It’s also likely Koepka signed a contract with LIV Golf, and getting out of a Saudi-backed deal has to be easier said than done.
If you’re the PGA Tour, a Koepka return would be a win.

That’s what well-connected journalist and author Alan Shipnuck is hearing.
“I’m hearing a lot of rumblings that Brooks Koepka has buyer’s remorse,” Alan Shipnuck said in his latest Ask Alan article(opens in new tab), where he answers questions from golf fans.
He joined his brother Chase in the Saudi-backed series and captains the Smash GC team, which was confirmed to be made up of younger brother Chase, Jason Kokrak and Matthew Wolff for the 2023 LIV Golf League that starts next week.
He currently ranks 78th in the world and will not be part of this year’s Ryder Cup due to his PGA Tour suspension.
