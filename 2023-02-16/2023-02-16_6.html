     Kevin Love has requested buyout from Cavs, sources say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Caesars Ohio Sportsbook is open for bets now that Ohio sports betting has launched.
Other sportsbooks in the state include DraftKings Sportsbook, FanDuel Ohio Sportsbook and Barstool Ohio.
Following Wednesday’s shootaround at Wells Fargo Center, Love bolted off the court and back to the locker room.
The Cavs -- and Love -- will work to figure out how much of this year’s salary ($28.9 million) he will give back in a potential buyout.
Given his continued shooting struggles and defensive limitations, it would have taken an unforeseen situation for Love to reclaim his spot.

     NBA rumors: This Celtics rival is interested in Kevin Love as he finalizes buyout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Report: Kevin Love reportedly is finalizing buyout from Cavs originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonAn NBA champion who could help a title contender in the 2023 playoffs is expected to become a free agent in the near future.
The Athletic's Shams Charania and Jason Lloyd reported Thursday that Kevin Love is finalizing a buyout with the Cleveland Cavaliers.
The Heat did not make any substantial upgrades before the Feb. 9 trade deadline, so it would make sense for them to dip into the buyout market for reinforcements.
He is shooting 35.4 percent from 3-point range this season -- down a little bit from his career average of 37.2 percent.
Love is unlikely to make a huge impact for his next team, but he can absolutely be a factor off the bench.

     Report: Kevin Love discussing possible buyout from Cavs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CLEVELAND (AP) — Five-time All-Star forward Kevin Love has discussed the possibility of a contract buyout from the Cleveland Cavaliers after being dropped from the rotation, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Thursday.
Love played well earlier this season before being slowed by a thumb injury.
Love’s situation became cloudier when the team signed veteran forward Danny Green after he became available via buyout.
Last week, Cavaliers president of basketball operations Koby Altman said he had not spoken to Love or his agents about a buyout and expected him to have a contributing role again at some point this season.
Coach J.B. Bickerstaff said something similar earlier this week, complimenting Love on continuing to be a good teammate and leader.

     Kevin Love’s 5 best destinations after buyout with Cavs, ranked
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Love and the Cleveland Cavaliers have finally parted ways after nine seasons and one memorable NBA championship together.
Love made two All-Star appearances in Cleveland, and was a big part of the Cavs’ 2016 championship team.
The Lakers don’t take or make many threes, which is an area where Love could help.
LA has also been a poor offensive rebounding team all year, and Love still has some ability in that area, too.
LA would probably welcome having another shooter like Love around, but if he wants consistent minutes this might not be the best fit.
