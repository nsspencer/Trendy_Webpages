     YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki steps down after nine years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The CEO of YouTube, Susan Wojcicki, will be stepping down after nine years at the helm of the world’s largest online video platform, she said in a blog post on Thursday.
Wojcicki, 54, was previously a senior vice-president for ad products at Google and became CEO of YouTube in 2014.
Before Google, Wojcicki worked at Intel and Bain &amp; Company.
Although she became one of the most respected female executives in the male-dominated tech industry, Wojcicki will also be remembered as Google’s first landlord.
More recently, YouTube has grappled with the meteoric rise of the short-form video platform TikTok, which overtook the Google-owned platform in viewing time in late 2022.
