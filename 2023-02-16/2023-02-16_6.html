     Unlikely hero Chris Livingston helps save Kentucky's season at Mississippi State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With its double-digit lead rapidly evaporating in the second half of a must-win game on the road, an unlikely hero emerged to help save Kentucky's season.
But with Mississippi State mounting a furious second half rally, Livingston came alive.
"In the second half, I knew I had to play harder and make some plays to make up for how I played in the first half."
Livingston then responded with a steal, was fouled on a breakaway and knocked down the two ensuing free throws.
“Down the second half stretch with about seven minutes left, that was all we were saying.

     Kentucky is back on the right side of the bubble in latest Joe Lunardi Bracketology
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Kentucky Wildcats pulled off a huge win in Starkville on Wednesday night, in what was the ultimate bubble game for both the Cats and the Mississippi State Bulldogs.
Starting the night out of the tournament, according to Joe Lunardi of ESPN, Kentucky has bolted to the ‘Last Four In’ category ahead of Saturday’s matchup with the Tennessee Volunteers.
Anything worse very likely means Kentucky won’t be dancing, especially when you factor in the likelihood of several bit stealers knocking at-large teams like Kentucky out of the field.
However, it’s one game at a time for a Kentucky team that clearly cannot overlook anyone and must bring its A-game from here on out.
1 Alabama on Wednesday, Tennessee will come to Rupp Arena confident that revenge is coming after the earlier loss in Knoxville.
