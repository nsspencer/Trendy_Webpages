     Kevin Love, Cavs appear likely to split after official downplayed buyout talks: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Things appeared to have changed quickly for Kevin Love and the Cleveland Cavaliers.
The Cavaliers acquired Love in the summer of 2014 when LeBron James returned to the franchise.
The trade helped set up a "Big Three" in Cleveland with Love, James and Kyrie Irving.
But in recent games, he’s fallen off J.B. Bickerstaff’s rotation.
Altman said ahead of the trade deadline there were no discussions about a Love buyout.

     Cleveland Cavaliers, Kevin Love finalizing contract buyout: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Love and the team are finalizing a contract buyout, according to a report by The Athletic.
If Love and the Cavs do end up parting ways, the Miami Heat, who currently hold the No.
He has spent parts of nine seasons with the Cavs, joining Cleveland shortly after LeBron James returned.
Cavs president of basketball operations Koby Altman said last week that he didn't anticipate a buyout with Love.
Love is the final year of a four-year, $120 million extension he signed shortly after James left for the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018.

     Summary: The Cavs and veteran forward Kevin Love are expected to part ways as soon as this afternoon.
No doubt that’s true, but anyone signing Love with hopes that he’ll be a difference maker should temper their expectations.
Kevin Love is on his way out of Cleveland.
This Is A Different Version Of Kevin LoveDespite championship experience (he won a title with the Cavaliers in 2016), Kevin Love is a shell of his former All-Star self.
His rebounding numbers have declined for four-straight seasons and he’s scoring less than 10 points per game.

     The Cleveland Cavaliers do the unthinkable and buyout Kevin Love
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cleveland Cavaliers have done the unthinkable and bought out franchise legend Kevin LoveThe Cleveland Cavaliers have bought out Kevin Love and made him a free agent, with the news breaking after the Cavs’ loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday.
Love, who lost his starting job to Evan Mobley, and later his rotational spot to Dean Wade, had not played in weeks.
Despite Love’s shooting, he was still passing and setting screens, but Cavaliers head coach J.B. Bickerstaff decided Love wasn’t contributing to the level he was supposed to, so he took Love out of the rotation for good.
The Cleveland Cavaliers and Kevin Love are finalizing a contract buyout, sources tell me and @ByJasonLloyd.
If Love goes to Miami, or wherever, and Bickerstaff continues to overwork the starters, then questions need to be answered.

     Kevin Love leaving Cleveland, possibly heading to Miami
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Johnny Askounis/ info@eurohoops.netIn a decreasing role with the Cleveland Cavaliers opting for other players, Kevin Love is forced to seek opportunities elsewhere in the NBALove, 34, is expected to reach a buyout agreement and become an unrestricted free agent, per The Athletic.
At 38-23, the Cavaliers are fourth in the Eastern Conference standings.
His 2022-23 efforts amount to 41 games played with 8.5 points, 6.8 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 0.2 blocks, and 0.2 steals per contest.
Back in 2014, the California-born big was traded from the Minnesota Timberwolves to the Cavs to team up with LeBron James.
Coming out of UCLA as the fifth overall pick in the 2008 NBA draft, Love got three All-Star Game nods with the Wolves and earned two more in Cleveland.

     Fans Want Kevin Love to Join LeBron James, Lakers amid Rumors After Win vs. Pelicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adam Pantozzi/NBAE via Getty ImagesFollowing the Los Angeles Lakers' impressive 120-102 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, Lakers fans and observers called for the team to continue adding to its new-look supporting cast by signing veteran forward Kevin Love.
Love is a career 37.2 percent shooter from beyond the arc, and he would give LeBron and AD yet another floor spacer to open things up for them.
All of them played a huge role in Wednesday's win over New Orleans, which is why James was able to return from a three-game absence due to an ankle injury and play a season-low 29 minutes.
LeBron usually has to empty the tank to lead the Lakers to wins, but that wasn't the case Wednesday, and bringing in yet another solid role player in Love can take the burden off James' shoulders even more.
The Lakers are seemingly a team on the rise, and if Love believes their playoff and championship chances are legitimate, it seems likely that he will at least strongly consider heading to Los Angeles.
