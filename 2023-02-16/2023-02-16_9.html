    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A grand jury has indicted Saints running back Alvin Kamara and three others for their alleged involvement in a Las Vegas beating in 2022, per David Charns of 8 News Now.
A Clark County grand jury indicted Kamara, Bengals cornerback Chris Lammons and two others for an incident outside of a strip club on Feb. 5, 2022, during Pro Bowl weekend.
Per a $10 million lawsuit filed by Greene, Kamara allegedly shoved Greene into a wall and punched him several times in the face.
After Kamara punched Greene the first time, the suit states that Greene attempted to run to protect himself.
Photos and surveillance footage showed Kamara striking Greene three more times while he was on the ground.

     Running back is a position of need for the Saints regardless of Alvin Kamara's status
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s beginning to look like the New Orleans Saints will be without Alvin Kamara for a stretch of games in 2023.
That’s sent a lot of Saints fans looking at running back free agents and draft prospects, but it’s a position of need for New Orleans regardless of Kamara’s status.
Their only running backs under contract for 2023 are Kamara, Eno Benjamin, Derrick Gore, and fullback Adam Prentice.
Outside of Kamara, that group produced 8 carries for 22 rushing yards and 4 receptions for 18 receiving yards last season.
The Saints need to get younger and more explosive in the backfield.

     Grand jury indicts Saints RB Alvin Kamara on battery charges from Feb. 2022 incident
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara was indicted Thursday by a Clark County (Nevada) grand jury for an alleged assault on Feb. 5, 2022, in Las Vegas, along with Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Chris Lammons and two other men.
Kamara, Lammons and fellow defendants Darrin Young and Percy Harris were indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit battery and battery resulting in substantial bodily harm against alleged victim Darnell Greene.
An initial arraignment was set for March 2 at the Eighth Judicial District Court, as the criminal case now bypasses Las Vegas Justice Court as a result of the indictment.
Kamara, 27, and the other defendants were arrested on Feb. 6, 2022, and the alleged incident occurred during the 2022 Pro Bowl weekend.
Kamara just completed his sixth season in the NFL with the Saints, who selected him in the third round of the 2017 NFL Draft.
