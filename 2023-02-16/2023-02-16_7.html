     Brooks Koepka Reportedly ‘Rethinking’ Move To LIV Golf, May Be Looking At A Way To Return To PGA Tour
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Videos by OutKickBrooks Koepka’s move to LIV Golf last year wasn’t necessarily a surprise.
READ: BROOKS KOEPKA TALKS JOINING LIV GOLF AFTER PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE TO PGA TOUR: ‘MY OPINION CHANGED’Koepka, who won the LIV event in Jeddah last year, has “buyer’s remorse” when it comes to joining LIV Golf, according to plugged in golf writer Alan Shipnuck.
(Photo by Jonathan Ferrey/LIV Golf via Getty Images)Given the pending lawsuits involving the PGA Tour, LIV Golf, and the DP World Tour, Koepka can’t just wake up tomorrow, quit LIV, and re-join the Tour.
It’s also likely Koepka signed a contract with LIV Golf, and getting out of a Saudi-backed deal has to be easier said than done.
If you’re the PGA Tour, a Koepka return would be a win.

     LIV Golf: Greg Norman's son slams 'BS' Brooks Koepka rumour
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Greg Norman's son has slammed the 'BS' rumour about LIV Golf's $100m man Brooks Koepka.
One DP World Tour pro tweeted today that "it would kill LIV" if Koepka does decide he wants a quick return to the PGA Tour.
Yet this is apparently untrue, according to Norman's son, who posted this underneath a link to the report:What did the report say about Koepka?
He cannot compete with Scottie Scheffler anymore, so he might as well join LIV Golf.
What do you think about the potential of a LIV Golf player returning to the PGA Tour?

1 Brooks Koepka is experiencing 'buyer's remorse' and regrets his decision to leave the PGA TourNot all that glitters is gold, it seems, amid suggestions Brooke Koepka is regretting his decision to join the Saudi-funded LIV Golf League.
But one year after the Saudi-backed breakaway first started to cause major divisions in the sport, it's rumoured Koepka is having 'buyer's remorse' over his investment.
The 32-year-old earned $8.2million (£7.2m at the time) during the inaugural LIV Golf campaign, where the Team Smash captain banked his sole event win in Jeddah.
"I’m hearing a lot of rumblings that Brooks Koepka has buyer’s remorse," golf author Alan Shipnuck wrote as part of a Q&amp;A for The Fire Pit Collective.
