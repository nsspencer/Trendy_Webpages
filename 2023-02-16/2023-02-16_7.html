     Summary: Tesla recalls nearly 363,000 cars with 'Full Self-Driving' to fix flaws in behaviorEnlarge this image toggle caption Ben Margot/AP Ben Margot/APDETROIT — Tesla is recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles with its "Full Self-Driving" system to fix problems with the way it behaves around intersections and following posted speed limits.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says in documents posted Thursday that Tesla will fix the concerns with an online software update in the coming weeks.
The documents say Tesla is doing the recall but does not agree with an agency analysis of the problem.
Tesla has received 18 warranty claims that could be caused by the software from May of 2019 through Sept. 12, 2022.
"As required by law and after discussions with NHTSA, Tesla launched a recall to repair those defects," the agency said.

     Tesla recall: Why it’s so bad, and how the government fell asleep at the wheel.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NHTSA recall affects over 360,000 Teslas with FSD, which is pretty much all of them.
Assuming Tesla does claim to have resolved the FSD problems NHTSA flagged, Americans may well have to take the company’s word for it.
AdvertisementAdvertisementNotably, there is no similar FSD recall in the European Union, because Tesla hasn’t received the green light to offer it there.
We trust you.” Manufacturers place a sticker on each new vehicle stating that it complies with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and they’re all set.
As the Tesla FSD recall shows, Congress owes the American people an answer.

     Summary: New York CNN —Tesla is recalling all 363,000 US vehicles with its so-called “Full Self Driving” driver assist software due to safety risks, another blow to the feature that is central to the automaker’s business model.
Tesla will attempt to fix the the FSD feature, which costs $15,000, through an over-the-air software update, the notice added.
A Troubled DevelopmentFSD is considered key to the company’s basic business plan, given the premiums that drivers pay for the features, and it’s ability to attract buyers to chose Tesla cars in the first place.
So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.”But other safety experts have questioned the validity of Tesla’s safety claims.
There have been high-profile accidents of Tesla cars using FSD or its more rudimentary predecessor known as “Autopilot.” Some of those accidents included fatalities.
