     Kentucky basketball’s NCAA Tournament chances are suddenly looking better
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If the Aggies climb inside the top 30, that becomes a Quad 1 win for Kentucky.
That remains a tenuous position, but the schedule Calipari mentioned means his team could feel much better about its NCAA Tournament hopes in the next few days.
Understanding the urgency to add resume-building wins, Calipari this week revived an old catch phrase from his UMass days.
The Cats, Calipari likes to point out, were also down two starters for almost the entirety of their worst loss of the season against South Carolina.
So, no, a hobbled Kentucky team that has actually won four of its last five road games is not dead yet.
