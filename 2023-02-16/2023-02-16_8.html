     KY lawmaker wants to end contracts like John Calipari’s
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Calipari’s contract is not technically a lifetime contract, though it’s popularly known by that designation.
“I’ve actually had a lot of constituents talk to me about ‘hey, should a employee of a public university get a lifetime contract?’ I think the argument is they probably shouldn’t, so I filed a bill.
I really think the best public policy is that really no employee at a state university should get a lifetime contract.
A lot of things can happen and the employer-employee situation may just not work,” Flannery said.
To me, I think the important question is ‘should employees of a state university receive a lifetime contract?’ I don’t think that’s good public policy.”This story will be updated.

     Citing Kentucky basketball coach John Calipari, legislator wants to ban lifetime contracts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FRANKFORT, Ky. — A Kentucky legislator filed a bill Thursday to prohibit state universities from giving lifetime contracts to employees, citing the contract of University of Kentucky men's basketball coach John Calipari.
"The primary motivation … obviously there's a basketball coach in this state that has a lifetime contract," said state Rep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill.
In 2019, Calipari signed what has been called a lifetime contract at UK, allowing him to transition into an ambassador role with a $1 million contract after he retires from coaching.
