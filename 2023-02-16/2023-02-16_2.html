     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Nearly a year after Bruce Willis’ family announced that he would step away from acting after being diagnosed with aphasia, his family says his “condition has progressed.”In a statement posted Thursday, the 67-year-old actor’s family said Willis has a more specific diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia.
“While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis,” the statement read.
“FTD is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone.”Last March, Willis’ family said his aphasia had affected his cognitive abilities.

     What is frontotemporal dementia? Experts explain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —After retiring from acting in March 2022 due to a speaking disorder called aphasia, Bruce Willis, 67, has since been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, his family announced Thursday.
It can occur because of a tumor on the brain, a stroke or from a progressive neurodegenerative condition,” Paulson said.
“Because his diagnosis is frontotemporal dementia, Mr. Willis clearly has a progressive, neurodegenerative disease as opposed to a stroke or a tumor or some other lesion on the brain,” he added.
Behavior variant frontotemporal dementia, or bvFTD, is characterized by changes in executive functions, thinking and planning.
To diagnose FTD disorders, a neurologist will conduct a careful clinical examination, paired with psychological testing designed to evaluate cognitive skills, Paulson said.
