     Kevin Love, Cleveland Cavaliers Reportedly Finalizing Contract Buyout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love (0) in the first half of an NBA basketball game Friday, Jan. ... [+] 6, 2023, in Denver.
As first reported by The Athletic’s Shams Charania and Jason Lloyd, the 34-year-old Love and the Cavs are finalizing a buyout agreement that would make him a free agent.
Cleveland.com reported that Love formally requested the buyout before the Cavs played the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday.
Ultimately, it feels like the thumb injury changed Love’s season and his fit with the Cavs.
But the thumb injury and drop in play changed things.

     Kevin Love, Cavs appear likely to split after official downplayed buyout talks: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Things appeared to have changed quickly for Kevin Love and the Cleveland Cavaliers.
The Cavaliers acquired Love in the summer of 2014 when LeBron James returned to the franchise.
The trade helped set up a "Big Three" in Cleveland with Love, James and Kyrie Irving.
But in recent games, he’s fallen off J.B. Bickerstaff’s rotation.
Altman said ahead of the trade deadline there were no discussions about a Love buyout.

     Report: Kevin Love discussing possible buyout from Cavs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CLEVELAND (AP) — Five-time All-Star forward Kevin Love has discussed the possibility of a contract buyout from the Cleveland Cavaliers after being dropped from the rotation, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Thursday.
Love played well earlier this season before being slowed by a thumb injury.
Love’s situation became cloudier when the team signed veteran forward Danny Green after he became available via buyout.
Last week, Cavaliers president of basketball operations Koby Altman said he had not spoken to Love or his agents about a buyout and expected him to have a contributing role again at some point this season.
Coach J.B. Bickerstaff said something similar earlier this week, complimenting Love on continuing to be a good teammate and leader.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Love and J.B. Bickerstaff recently had a difficult conversation which led to the two agreeing that Love would be out of the Cleveland Cavaliers’ rotation in favor of Dean Wade.
Love seemingly could’ve been a possible expiring trade candidate near the NBA Trade Deadline, though he wasn’t ultimately moved.
Love hasn’t had the same success with the Cavs as he did last season, but the two had a great run.
Love was the last remaining member of that Cavaliers title team prior to this buyout news, to that point.
It was a great run for Love with the Cavs, and down the road, I would be the least bit shocked to see his No.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Love is finalizing a contract buyout with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Miami Heat are waiting to pounce as the top candidate to pick up the last of the Cavs’ old Big 3, according to The Athletic.
The Heat, who have an open roster spot, have been searching for a big man, The Athletic reported, and the 6-foot-8, 251-pound Love would fit the bill.
Love, 34, has been with Cleveland for the last nine years after six seasons with the Timberwolves, who drafted him at No.
Cleveland Cavaliers’ Kevin Love is finalizing a contract buyout post trade deadline to become a free agent.
Recently, he was pulled from the Cavs’ rotation, which has created a path for the contract buyout and the opportunity to play for a new team.

     Summary: Caesars Ohio Sportsbook is open for bets now that Ohio sports betting has launched.
Other sportsbooks in the state include DraftKings Sportsbook, FanDuel Ohio Sportsbook and Barstool Ohio.
Following Wednesday’s shootaround at Wells Fargo Center, Love bolted off the court and back to the locker room.
The Cavs -- and Love -- will work to figure out how much of this year’s salary ($28.9 million) he will give back in a potential buyout.
Given his continued shooting struggles and defensive limitations, it would have taken an unforeseen situation for Love to reclaim his spot.
