     Bruce Willis diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia: What to know about the disorder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Blockbuster action movie star Bruce Willis stepped away from acting in spring 2022 after being diagnosed with aphasia , a neurological disorder that impacts the ability to produce and understand words.
Now, Willis' condition has progressed and he's received a new diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, his family announced (opens in new tab) Thursday (Feb. 16).
"Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces," the statement reads.
The prevalence of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is somewhat uncertain, because historically, doctors sometimes misidentified the condition as depression, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease , according to University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Health (opens in new tab).

     What is frontotemporal dementia? Experts explain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —After retiring from acting in March 2022 due to a speaking disorder called aphasia, Bruce Willis, 67, has since been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, his family announced Thursday.
“Because his diagnosis is frontotemporal dementia, Mr. Willis clearly has a progressive, neurodegenerative disease as opposed to a stroke or a tumor or some other lesion on the brain,” he added.
Behavior variant frontotemporal dementia, or bvFTD, is characterized by changes in executive functions, thinking and planning.
In primary progressive aphasia, or PPA, the person might have trouble speaking or understanding words or might slur their speech.
To diagnose FTD disorders, a neurologist will conduct a careful clinical examination, paired with psychological testing designed to evaluate cognitive skills, Paulson said.
