     Tiger Woods finishes Genesis Invitational Round 1 with flurry of birdies in PGA Tour return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There were just as many positive and negative takeaways from Tiger Woods’ return to non-major PGA Tour action on Thursday.
The 82-time winner ho-hummed his way around Riviera Country Club near Los Angeles to the tune of a 2-under 69 in the opening round of the 2023 Genesis Invitational and walked off the course T-27.
Five drives were 320 yards or longer, with his longest of the day reaching 338 yards.
Woods then closed his round out the only way he knew how, in style with a third consecutive birdie.
GENESIS INVITATIONAL ROUND 2:Tee times, TV and streaming infoStill recovering from a single-car accident that nearly cost him his leg, Woods walked with ease for most of the round but began to labor a bit down the stretch.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For those looking for encouragement from this outing, beyond the closing birdie barrage, Woods’ gait looked better than it did when he played, riding in a cart, in The Match in December and then again at the PNC Championship with son, Charlie.
But he still slightly dragged his right leg due to the ankle that was damaged in his car accident two years ago, as well as the plantar fasciitis that he’s contended with more recently.

     Summary: A day that started with butterflies ended with birdies — three in a row — as Tiger Woods navigated Riviera Country Club on Thursday with a round as crisp as the cool afternoon.
“So I’ve had so many surgeries that the ankle just keeps changing, the leg keeps changing.
Part of the pleasure, Woods said, was playing with his friends, Justin Thomas and Rory McIlroy, who likewise had strong rounds.
Fans hold up smartphones to catch a glimpse of Tiger Woods as he tees off during the first round of the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club.
McIlroy, who in other situations would be the marquee attraction, happily shrugged off hearing Tiger chants throughout his round.

After the round, McIlroy didn’t sound too pleased with Woods outdriving him throughout the afternoon.
