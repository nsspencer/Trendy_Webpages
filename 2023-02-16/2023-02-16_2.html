     Bruce Willis diagnosed with 'cruel disease' frontotemporal dementia, family announces
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actor Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, family members announced in a joint Instagram post Thursday.
"Since we announced Bruce’s diagnosis of aphasia in spring 2022, Bruce’s condition has progressed and we now have a more specific diagnosis: frontotemporal dementia (known as FTD)."
"While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis," the Instagram post states.
FTD is a "cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone," the Willis family wrote in a separate statement.
For Willis' 65th birthday, Moore, who remains close to Willis and his wife, dedicated an Instagram post to him.

     Summary: Actor Bruce Willis has frontotemporal dementia, his family said Thursday.
In a heartfelt statement, Willis' family, including ex-wife Demi Moore and daughter Rumer Willis, shared that his aphasia diagnosis, which the family announced in March, has progressed.
Willis' wife, Emma Heming Willis; Moore; and his five daughters, Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel and Evelyn, shared a detailed statement with the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration.
