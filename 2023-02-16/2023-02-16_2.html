     Cleveland Cavaliers, Kevin Love finalizing contract buyout: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Love and the team are finalizing a contract buyout, according to a report by The Athletic.
If Love and the Cavs do end up parting ways, the Miami Heat, who currently hold the No.
He has spent parts of nine seasons with the Cavs, joining Cleveland shortly after LeBron James returned.
Cavs president of basketball operations Koby Altman said last week that he didn't anticipate a buyout with Love.
Love is the final year of a four-year, $120 million extension he signed shortly after James left for the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018.

     Fans Want Kevin Love to Join LeBron James, Lakers amid Rumors After Win vs. Pelicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adam Pantozzi/NBAE via Getty ImagesFollowing the Los Angeles Lakers' impressive 120-102 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, Lakers fans and observers called for the team to continue adding to its new-look supporting cast by signing veteran forward Kevin Love.
Love is a career 37.2 percent shooter from beyond the arc, and he would give LeBron and AD yet another floor spacer to open things up for them.
All of them played a huge role in Wednesday's win over New Orleans, which is why James was able to return from a three-game absence due to an ankle injury and play a season-low 29 minutes.
LeBron usually has to empty the tank to lead the Lakers to wins, but that wasn't the case Wednesday, and bringing in yet another solid role player in Love can take the burden off James' shoulders even more.
The Lakers are seemingly a team on the rise, and if Love believes their playoff and championship chances are legitimate, it seems likely that he will at least strongly consider heading to Los Angeles.

     Kevin Love has requested buyout from Cavs, sources say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Caesars Ohio Sportsbook is open for bets now that Ohio sports betting has launched.
Other sportsbooks in the state include DraftKings Sportsbook, FanDuel Ohio Sportsbook and Barstool Ohio.
Following Wednesday’s shootaround at Wells Fargo Center, Love bolted off the court and back to the locker room.
The Cavs -- and Love -- will work to figure out how much of this year’s salary ($28.9 million) he will give back in a potential buyout.
Given his continued shooting struggles and defensive limitations, it would have taken an unforeseen situation for Love to reclaim his spot.

     Kevin Love nears Cavaliers buyout with Heat looming
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Love is finalizing a contract buyout with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Miami Heat are waiting to pounce as the top candidate to pick up the last of the Cavs’ old Big 3, according to The Athletic.
The Heat, who have an open roster spot, have been searching for a big man, The Athletic reported, and the 6-foot-8, 251-pound Love would fit the bill.
Love, 34, has been with Cleveland for the last nine years after six seasons with the Timberwolves, who drafted him at No.
Cleveland Cavaliers’ Kevin Love is finalizing a contract buyout post trade deadline to become a free agent.
Recently, he was pulled from the Cavs’ rotation, which has created a path for the contract buyout and the opportunity to play for a new team.
