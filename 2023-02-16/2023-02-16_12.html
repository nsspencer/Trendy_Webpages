     Summary: Videos by OutKickTiger Woods’ got a message for Justin Thomas: plug up and shut up.
Tiger pulled off a legendary stunt on Thursday when he passed Justin Thomas on Hole 9 to hand off a gift that pulls at the (heart) strings.
Before thousands of spectators, Woods handed Thomas a tampon he had been carrying around until he finally reached JT, having eagerly waited to tell him to kiss his behind.
“I need a LIV vs PGA tour Ryder cup type event just so Tiger can give Phil a tampon after out driving him,” Spiranac tweeted.
If anyone’s seen Tiger Woods’ HBO documentary, they’re well aware this isn’t his first time carrying around a tampon.

Not only did he open the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club with a 2-under 69, but he brought the trash talk with him.
