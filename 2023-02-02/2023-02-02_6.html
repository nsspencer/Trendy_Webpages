    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Click here to subscribe to the Sports Hub Underground podcast.)
The Bruins need to give up a big package in order to land a player of Bo Horvat’s caliber.
Despite the 2023 NHL trade deadline being over a month away, the New York Islanders decided to make their big move in late January with the addition of Horvat.
So that now begs the question: if the Bruins want to trade for a true impact player like Horvat, what do they need to give up?
So, what is the Bruins’ baseline?

     NHL rumors: Bruins 'believed' to be in the market for a left defenseman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins are the favorites to win the Stanley Cup this season, but they could still use some reinforcements before the March 3 NHL trade deadline.
Here's what Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman wrote in his latest 32 Thoughts column Wednesday:"Boston is also believed to be in the left-defence market.
The Bruins are in pretty good shape on the left side of the blue line.
Hampus Lindholm is on pace to set a new single-season career high in points, and he has played like a true top-pairing defenseman all season.
Boston also has veteran defenseman Mike Reilly, who is a left-hand shot, buried in the minors with the AHL's Providence Bruins.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bruins and Celtics delivered a pair of Wednesday night whoopings against division rivals that should continue to put their respective leagues on notice.
The Bruins horsed around with the Maple Leafs for two periods in Toronto.
In Toronto, the Maple Leafs came away believing they’re close to the Bruins.
Boston has won two of three this season with its division rival, but the Leafs swept the season series last year.
Yet, as close as Toronto might feel it is to the Bruins, there’s still a significant enough gap — and the Maple Leafs know it.

     Summary: Feb 1, 2023; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Boston Bruins forward Pavel Zacha (18) is congratulated after his goal against the Toronto Maple Leafs during the third period at Scotiabank Arena.
Mandatory Credit: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY SportsOnce sliding to the tune of three straight defeats, the Bruins will ride into the All-Star break on a high thanks to a big victory over the rival Maple Leafs on Wednesday night in Toronto.
Beating the Maple Leafs is always good for a Black and Gold soul, though, and Wednesday night was no exception.
In what was a largely back-and-forth game, the Bruins and Leafs traded punches, and even found themselves engaged in a one-goal game in the third period behind a goal-trading of sorts from the Bruins’ A.J.

     Bruins-Maple Leafs: What we learned as Boston snaps 3-game losing streak

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bruins Bruins-Maple Leafs: What we learned as Boston snaps 3-game losing streak The Bruins snapped their only losing streak of the season and head into the All-Star break with a 5-2 win.
The Boston Bruins had hit a rut, seemingly running out of gas following three games in four nights against some of the NHL’s toughest opponents.
Instead, the Bruins addressed the many concerns that arose during their first multi-game losing streak of the year.
Derek Forbort and Brandon Carlo gave Boston their first two leads of the night, occurring at 6:57 and 12:33 of the second period, respectively.

     NHL Source: ‘If Bruins Want Chychrun, They’re Moving A Roster D’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In his latest 32 Thoughts column for Sportsnet, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman said he wouldn’t be surprised if the Boston Bruins have at least looked into acquiring Arizona Coyotes defenseman Jakob Chychrun on the NHL trade market.
Vladislav Gavrikov was a name in NHL trade speculation mentioned here as well, just last week and it feels like a certainty he will be moved ahead of the March 3 NHL Trade Deadline.
Numerous sources have confirmed to Boston Hockey Now that the Canucks were interested in Bruins defenseman Brandon Carlo and even more interested in winger Jake DeBrusk as part of any NHL trade package from the Bruins.
I’d say it’s highly unlikely, but a roster defenseman like him or Matt Grzelcyk may be also be what it takes if Sweeney truly wants to acquire Chychrun on the NHL trade market.
“If the Bruins want Chychrun, they’re moving a roster D,” an NHL source told BHN on Thursday.

     Summary: When next we see the Bruins, facing off against the Capitals Feb. 11 at TD Garden, the March 3 NHL trade deadline will be only a touch under three weeks away.
Advertisement“I wouldn’t say it’s a concern,” team president Cam Neely said on Wednesday while watching his club’s morning workout in Toronto.
These Bruins might not score at will or in the same bushel basket abundance as Phil Esposito, John Bucyk, Orr, et al.
They hit the break with a plus-82 goal differential, vastly outdistancing the Stars, who are the runners-up at plus-41.
A package that most likely would include Jake DeBrusk, due back in the lineup from injury when the Bruins return against the Capitals.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here's our ranking of the Bruins' biggest needs that must be addressed before the trade deadline.
Jake DeBrusk has played plenty of right wing with Bergeron and Marchand, but he's a natural left wing.
Kevin LeBlanc of the San Jose Sharks can play right wing.
Adding another forward who can play center or wing would be a great bottom-six addition for the Bruins.
He'd provide a nice bottom-six boost, and his familiarity with many of the B's players would be a bonus.
