     Jessica Simpson Writes About 'Movie Star' Romance After Nick Lachey Divorce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The story details how Simpson was pursued — both before and after her marriage to fellow pop star Nick Lachey — by a world-famous movie star.
"I had spent that summer apart from my first real boyfriend, Nick, and I still didn’t know how to be single," writes Simpson.
The Movie Star, writes Simpson, "gave me a different hug; a modified celebrity embrace he held a few seconds longer than I expected."
Simpson's interaction with the Movie Star feels "dreamy," reminding her of romance novels by "Jane Austen and the Brontë sisters."
Jessica SimpsonDays later, on Sept. 11, 2001, Lachey calls Simpson from New York and the pair get back together.
