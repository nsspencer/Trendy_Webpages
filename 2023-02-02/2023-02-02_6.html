     Summary: Pentagon says a suspected Chinese spy balloon has been spotted over the Western U.S.Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/APWASHINGTON — The U.S. is tracking a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that has been spotted over U.S. airspace for a couple days, but the Pentagon decided not to shoot it down due to risks of harm for people on the ground, officials said Thursday.
A senior defense official told Pentagon reporters that the U.S. has "very high confidence" it is a Chinese high-altitude balloon and it was flying over sensitive sites to collect information.
One of the places the balloon was spotted was Montana, which is home to one of the nation's three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base.
Gen. Patrick Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, provided a brief statement on the issue, saying the government continues to track the balloon.
The defense official said the U.S. has "engaged" Chinese officials through multiple channels and communicated the seriousness of the matter.

     Chinese Spy Balloon: Why the U.S. Didn't Shoot It Down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. military has identified a suspected Chinese spy balloon flying high above the northern part of the continental United States in recent days, which prompted President Joe Biden to ask for military options against it, according to senior defense officials.
“The United States government has detected and is tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon that is over the continental United States right now,” Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Pat Ryder said in a statement.
The Biden Administration has determined that the balloon doesn’t give the China any additional surveillance capabilities beyond what it already can collect through spy satellites currently orbiting the Earth, the official said.
When the balloon was detected by U.S. intelligence, the official said the military acted swiftly to guard against the Chinese collecting sensitive information.
“Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken additional mitigation steps.” The official wouldn’t detail what those actions were.

A senior defense official told the network that the balloon remains over the U.S. but declined to say where.
The city won't comment on the military's contention about the Chinese spy balloon, Hill said, referring all questions to the FAA.
