     Aaron Rodgers Denies 49ers Speculation With One-Liner at Pebble Beach Pro-Am
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rodgers offers matter-of-fact answer about 49ers speculation originally appeared on NBC Sports ChicagoTom Brady's second retirement announcement on Wednesday brought an end to any speculation that the NFL veteran would play for the 49ers next season.
Despite uncertainty surrounding where Green Bay Packers signal-caller Aaron Rodgers will play next season, he quickly ruled out one possible destination at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am on Wednesday.
Still, the 49ers likely will look to bolster their roster with a veteran presence at the position as well -- though almost assuredly not a quarterback of Rodgers' notoriety or price point.
Another spring and summer full of quarterback questions looms for the 49ers.
But at least two future Hall of Famers can be left out of the discussion.

     Summary: Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is taking part in the 2023 AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.
You might’ve heard because he decided to skip out on the 2023 Pro Bowl to do so.
Regardless, Allen is teeing up in the golf tournament once again–Which is what he did last year.
Speaking of, Allen has been been teamed up with the same partner once again.
The two were a team at last year’s event and finished 15-under after three rounds but failed to make the cut.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though the Bay Area is out, Davante Adams is trying his best to get Aaron Rodgers to move to Las Vegas this fall.
The longtime Green Bay Packers quarterback did make one thing clear on the tee at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am on Thursday.
Rodgers has yet to say whether he even wants to continue playing next season, which would be his 19th in the league, let alone stay in Green Bay.
He has said he wanted to finish his career in Green Bay in the past, but said earlier this year that he’d be open to other options — including reworking his contract.
Rodgers’ longtime receiver Davante Adams continued his push to get Rodgers to Las Vegas, too.
