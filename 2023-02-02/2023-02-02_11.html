     Summary: (NewsNation) — Hunter Biden is going on offense after years of attacks, calling for investigations into wey figures connected to the infamous laptop.
Mac Isaac insists that the majority of the letter is ridiculous and full of inaccuracies.
Hunter Biden came into my shop; he came in with three liquid damaged laptops.
Everything else that’s being said in that letter is absolutely ridiculous,” Mac Isaac told NewsNation host Dan Abrams on Thursday.
Mac Isaac’s attorney, Brian Della Rocca, said Hunter Biden interacted with Isaac on two occasions and maintained that Mac Isaac was authorized to access the data.

     Summary: Hunter Biden appears to have launched his first real counteroffensive against Fox News and Trumpworld.
In identical statements sent to NBC, CBS, and The Washington Post, an anonymous “person familiar with the first son’s strategy” promoted this pivot to a more aggressive legal tactic in dramatic terms: “This marks a new approach by Hunter Biden and his team.
Until now, Biden has kept a relatively low profile as his father starts his third year in the White House.
Biden’s lawyers believe he may have violated state laws by accessing files on the laptop.
(In fact, according to The Post, Hunter Biden spent $49,910 every three months on office space in Washington.)

     Hunter Biden’s Attorney Issues Legal Threat Over Tucker Carlson, Fox News Segments About $50,000 Rent Payments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An attorney representing Hunter Biden has fired off a legal threat to Tucker Carlson and Fox News, demanding a retraction for segments suggesting that Biden made nearly $50,000-a-month in housing rent payments to his father President Joe Biden.
Carlson’s segment on Jan. 16 cited a rental application background check form allegedly filled out by Hunter Biden in 2018.
Fox News anchor John Roberts said, “Hunter Biden listed that Wilmington home as his primary residence that he was renting for $50,000 a month.
Sullivan also is demanding that Carlson and other Fox News commentators “spend the same amount of time” retracting the rent story.
Meanwhile, House Republicans are pressing forward on investigations of aspects of the Hunter Biden story.

The letters accused Mac Isaac of “unlawfully” accessing data in Biden’s laptop.
Mac Isaac initially filed the lawsuit in May of last year against Adam Schiff, CNN, the Daily Beast and Politico.

     TUCKER CARLSON: Hunter Biden versus laptop repairman doesn't seem like a fair fight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RATCLIFFE: HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP WAS A PARTISAN DOMESTIC ‘DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN’So the message was unmistakable.
And yet neither Hunter Biden nor his father, Joe Biden, have ever been indicted for doing that.
Yesterday, Hunter Biden's legal team released a letter demanding that Joe Biden's friends imprison anyone who criticizes Joe Biden's son.
And that list would include, among others, John Paul Mac Isaac, the owner of the Mac repair shop where Hunter Biden abandoned said laptop.
Again, this is the person that Hunter Biden's lawyers are calling on to send John Paul Mac Isaac to jail.
