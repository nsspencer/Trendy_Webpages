     McCarthy calls for intel briefing on Chinese spy balloon over Montana
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I am requesting a Gang of Eight briefing.” | Susan Walsh/AP PhotoPresident Joe Biden was briefed on the situation and asked for military options, said the senior DoD official.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin convened senior Pentagon leaders on Wednesday while he was traveling in the Philippines, and discussed the possibility of shooting it down.
Revelations about the suspected spy balloon sparked angry reactions among lawmakers, beyond McCarthy.
“Biden should shoot down the Chinese spy balloon immediately,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said in a tweet .
This kind of activity has happened “a handful of other times” over the past few years, including before the Biden administration, the senior DoD official said.

     China says it is looking into the report of a spy balloon over U.S. airspace

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: China says it is looking into the report of a spy balloon over U.S. airspaceEnlarge this image toggle caption Larry Mayer/AP Larry Mayer/APBEIJING — China said Friday it is looking into reports that a Chinese spy balloon has been flying in U.S. airspace and urged calm, adding that it has "no intention of violating the territory and airspace of any sovereign country."
At a daily briefing, Mao said that politicians and the public should withhold judgment "before we have a clear understanding of the facts" about the spy balloon reports.
"China is a responsible country and has always strictly abided by international laws, and China has no intention of violating the territory and airspace of any sovereign country.
The defense official said the U.S. has "engaged" Chinese officials through multiple channels and communicated the seriousness of the matter.
The senior defense official said the U.S. prepared fighter jets, including F-22s, to shoot down the balloon if ordered.

     Pentagon says it is monitoring Chinese spy balloon spotted flying over US
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pentagon has said it is tracking a Chinese spy balloon flying over the US but decided against shooting it down for safety reasons.
The Chinese government has not confirmed if it owns the balloon, and state-backed media has used the incident to taunt the US.
A senior US defence official said the US had “engaged” with Chinese officials through multiple channels about the seriousness of the matter.
Pentagon officials said there was “high confidence” that the balloon was Chinese, and that Joe Biden had been briefed on the situation.
The Pentagon says the suspected Chinese spy balloon ‘does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground’.

     Suspected Chinese spy balloon found over northern U.S.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A senior administration official confirmed that Biden had been briefed and received a “strong recommendation” that the balloon not be shot down.
“Instances of this activity have been observed over the past several years, including prior to this administration,” said the senior administration official.
“Currently we assess that this balloon has limited additive value from an intelligence collection perspective over and above what the PRC can do through other means,” the senior defense official said.
The official said the U.S. military will continue to monitor it closely and will keep the option of taking out the balloon on the table.
This type of activity is not unprecedented, the senior defense official said, with China flying stratospheric balloons like this before, but the difference this time is the balloon is staying over the U.S. longer than usual.

     Pentagon tracking suspected Chinese spy balloon over the US
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —The US is tracking a suspected Chinese high-altitude surveillance balloon over the continental United States, defense officials said on Thursday, a discovery that risks adding further strain to tense US-China relations.
“We are confident that this high-altitude surveillance balloon belongs to the [People’s Republic of China],” the senior defense official said.
“It puts Chinese officials on the backfoot heading into the meetings.”Biden has declared China “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge” and competition between the two global superpowers is intense.
A suspected Chinese high altitude balloon floats over Billings, Montana on Wednesday, February 1, 2023.
The senior defense official said on Thursday that if the risk level changes, the US “will have options to deal with this balloon.”We have communicated to [Chinese officials] the seriousness with which we take this issue.
