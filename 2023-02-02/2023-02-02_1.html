     Summary: Feb 1, 2023; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Boston Bruins forward Pavel Zacha (18) is congratulated after his goal against the Toronto Maple Leafs during the third period at Scotiabank Arena.
Mandatory Credit: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY SportsOnce sliding to the tune of three straight defeats, the Bruins will ride into the All-Star break on a high thanks to a big victory over the rival Maple Leafs on Wednesday night in Toronto.
Beating the Maple Leafs is always good for a Black and Gold soul, though, and Wednesday night was no exception.
In what was a largely back-and-forth game, the Bruins and Leafs traded punches, and even found themselves engaged in a one-goal game in the third period behind a goal-trading of sorts from the Bruins’ A.J.
Here are the 98.5 The Sports Hub (dot com) 3 Stars of the game from a 5-2 win in Toronto…

     Summary: Bruins Bruins-Maple Leafs: What we learned as Boston snaps 3-game losing streak The Bruins snapped their only losing streak of the season and head into the All-Star break with a 5-2 win.
The Boston Bruins had hit a rut, seemingly running out of gas following three games in four nights against some of the NHL’s toughest opponents.
Instead, the Bruins addressed the many concerns that arose during their first multi-game losing streak of the year.
Derek Forbort and Brandon Carlo gave Boston their first two leads of the night, occurring at 6:57 and 12:33 of the second period, respectively.
