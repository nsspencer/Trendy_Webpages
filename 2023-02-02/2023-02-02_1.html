     Apple sales drop 5% in largest quarterly revenue decline since 2016
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple's overall sales for the holiday quarter were about 5% lower than last year's, the first year-over-year sales decline since 2019.
The company's data points suggested iPhone sales won't decline as rapidly as they did during the December quarter.
Apple CFO Luca Maestri said March quarter revenue would have a similar year-over-year trend to the December quarter, where overall sales declined over 5%.
IPhone sales will decline less in the March quarter versus the December quarter, Apple added.
It was Apple's first year-over-year quarterly revenue decline since 2019 and the biggest annual quarterly revenue drop since September 2016.
