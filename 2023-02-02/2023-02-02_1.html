     Amazon moves lower on mixed earnings result, slowing growth (NASDAQ:AMZN)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock wavered in Thursday’s extended trading as the market digested a mixed Q4 earnings report.
Headlining the quarterly results was a big revenue beat, with $149.2B in revenue exceeding analyst estimates by $3.43B.
That slight disappointment was offset by continued rapid growth in advertising revenue and strong North American net sales.
That said, net income for the quarter includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $2.3B related to the company’s investment in Rivian Automotive (RIVN).
Operating income is expected to be between $0 and $4B as compared to $3.7B in the first quarter of 2022.
