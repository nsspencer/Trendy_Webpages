     Summary: Reporter shares likelihood that Raiders trade Derek CarrDerek Carr will be changing teams before too long, but the question is will that be through a trade or in free agency.
The Las Vegas Raiders have until Feb. 15 to either trade or cut Carr before his contract becomes guaranteed.
NFL Media’s Jim Trotter reported Friday that the chances the Raiders trade Carr are less than one percent.
From @NFLTotalAccess: The #Raiders have not granted Derek Carr free rein to speak to other teams about a possible trade, which is keeping the odds of such a move happening very low.
In order for a trade to happen, the Raiders would have to agree with another team on trade terms.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Raiders wish to trade quarterback Derek Carr.
As noted by Vic Tafur, who covers the Raiders for TheAthletic.com: “Nothing has changed.
Carr’s agent can’t talk to teams until they agree on compensation, which they likely wouldn’t until they talk about the contract.” Significantly, Carr himself “liked” Tafur’s tweet.
If the Raiders are doing what Schefter suggests they’re doing, they’re obviously being unreasonable in their expectations, because the current list of teams with which Carr is authorized to speak stands at .
Thus, for now, we’re assuming Carr will be released by February 15.

     Derek Carr pokes fun at Raiders after winning precision passing competition in Pro Bowl skills challenge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Soon-to-be former Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr was a late addition to the AFC Pro Bowl roster as a replacement, giving him one more shot to toss the pigskin around in Sin City.
The Pro Bowl skills competition kicked off on Thursday night with the precision passing drill, and AFC coach Peyton Manning made the wise decision to have Carr throw third after Trevor Lawrence and Tyler Huntley.
Carr scored 31 total points, lifting the AFC side to victory.
Following the victory, Carr spoke with ESPN's Ryan Clark, who asked him if he had ever been that hot in Las Vegas.
36 overall pick out of Fresno State likely leaves the Raiders as their all-time passing leader (35,222 yards), all-time passing touchdowns leader (217) and second in wins (63).

     Report: Raiders allow Derek Carr to speak with teams that have agreed to compensation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Beyond using his Pro Bowl interviews to get some self-deprecating jokes off, quarterback Derek Carr also sent a message that the Raiders seemed to receive on Friday.
According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Las Vegas has granted Carr permission to speak with potential trade partners, as long as they’re willing to compensate his former team.
"That's for [the Raiders] to talk about," he said when ESPN asked about the team's refusal to allow conversations.
He reported that interested teams believe they can sign Carr for a “more favorable contract” than the one they would inherit in a trade.
In 15 games this season, Carr posted 3,522 passing yards, a 60.8% completion rate, 24 passing touchdowns, 14 interceptions and 7 yards per pass attempt.
