Kurt Kitayama, who has two runner-up finishes but is winless in 46 PGA Tour events, had a 64, also at MPCC.
I felt really comfortable out there.
Then just started to feel comfortable with my putter.”Chad Ramey, a one-time PGA Tour winner who has played in 40 career events, had a front-nine 30 at Pebble Beach with four straight birdies beginning on the fourth hole, carded a 65 at Pebble Beach Golf Links.
