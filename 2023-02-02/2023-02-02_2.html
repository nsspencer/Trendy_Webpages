     Amazon Stock Falls on Mixed Earnings Report and Weak Forecast. AWS Missed Too.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares of Amazon com fell in late trading Thursday after the company posted mixed results for the fourth quarter, reflecting the ongoing pressures from a softening economy.
The company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales growth, but weaker-than-anticipated profits, due largely to a loss on the company’s stake in electric-truck maker Rivian Automotive (ticker: RIVN)

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon (AMZN) reported fourth-quarter results late Thursday that beat on revenue but missed on earnings, as its typically strong cloud computing unit failed to rescue the e-commerce giant.
Analysts expected Amazon to report earnings of 17 cents a share on revenue of $145.7 billion.
Sales for its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, jumped 20% to $21.4 billion but were slightly below expectations and down from 27.5% growth in the third quarter.
AMZN stock plunged in late October after the company reported third-quarter results that beat on earnings.

     Amazon moves lower on mixed earnings result, slowing growth (NASDAQ:AMZN)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock wavered in Thursday’s extended trading as the market digested a mixed Q4 earnings report.
Headlining the quarterly results was a big revenue beat, with $149.2B in revenue exceeding analyst estimates by $3.43B.
That slight disappointment was offset by continued rapid growth in advertising revenue and strong North American net sales.
He indicated that this strategy serves the long-term interest of the company even if it stands to hamper quarterly results from time to time.
He added that his team is not looking to optimize quarterly results, but instead build the business and maintain customers for the longer term.

     Why Amazon Stock Jumped 23% in January
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished January up 23%.
First, Amazon said it would expand the layoffs it announced in November from 10,000 to 18,000.
Though layoffs mean real people losing their jobs, they often result in stock gains, as it shows that a company is reining in costs.
Amazon also announced that it would open its Buy with Prime program to any eligible sellers in the U.S.
With today's gains, the stock is up roughly 40% since its bottom last December, showing a dramatic shift in sentiment toward Amazon stock.
