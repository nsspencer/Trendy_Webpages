     Chinese spy balloon spotted in American skies, Pentagon says; US weighed shooting it down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON – A Chinese spy balloon has been spotted drifting over the northern United States, and Pentagon officials have considered shooting it down, Defense Department officials said late Thursday.
The balloon was over Montana when the U.S. considered destroying it, the official said.
"The United States government has detected and is tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon that is flying over the continental United States right now," Air Force Brig.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have been briefed on the balloon, the official said.
It is not the first time Chinese spy balloons have flown over the United States, the official said.

     Summary: Pentagon says a suspected Chinese spy balloon has been spotted over the Western U.S.Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/APWASHINGTON — The U.S. is tracking a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that has been spotted over U.S. airspace for a couple days, but the Pentagon decided not to shoot it down due to risks of harm for people on the ground, officials said Thursday.
A senior defense official told Pentagon reporters that the U.S. has "very high confidence" it is a Chinese high-altitude balloon and it was flying over sensitive sites to collect information.
One of the places the balloon was spotted was Montana, which is home to one of the nation's three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base.
Gen. Patrick Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, provided a brief statement on the issue, saying the government continues to track the balloon.
The defense official said the U.S. has "engaged" Chinese officials through multiple channels and communicated the seriousness of the matter.

     Chinese Spy Balloon: Why the U.S. Didn't Shoot It Down
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. military has identified a suspected Chinese spy balloon flying high above the northern part of the continental United States in recent days, which prompted President Joe Biden to ask for military options against it, according to senior defense officials.
“The United States government has detected and is tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon that is over the continental United States right now,” Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Pat Ryder said in a statement.
The Biden Administration has determined that the balloon doesn’t give China any additional surveillance capabilities beyond what it already can collect through spy satellites currently orbiting the Earth, the official said.
When the balloon was detected by U.S. intelligence, the official said the military acted swiftly to guard against the Chinese collecting sensitive information.
“Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken additional mitigation steps.” The official wouldn’t detail what those actions were.

     Summary: The Pentagon has said it is tracking a Chinese spy balloon flying over the United States but decided against shooting it down for safety reasons.
Defence officials said the balloon has been watched for a couple days since it entered US airspace, flying at high altitude.
Canada’s national defence department later said it too had detected a high-altitude surveillance balloon and was “monitoring of a potential second incident”.
A senior US defence official said the US has “engaged” Chinese officials through multiple channels and communicated the seriousness of the matter.
The Pentagon says the suspected Chinese spy balloon ‘does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground’.

     What is a suspected Chinese spy balloon doing above the US?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Seoul, South Korea CNN —News that the Pentagon is monitoring a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon in the skies over the continental United States raises a series of questions – not least among them, what exactly it might be doing.
This is not the first time a Chinese balloon has been spotted over the US, but this seems to be acting differently to previous ones, a US defense official said.
“Balloon payloads can now weigh less and so the balloons can be smaller, cheaper and easier to launch” than satellites, Layton said.
According to Layton, the suspected Chinese balloon is likely collecting information on US communication systems and radars.
Intelligence data collected by the balloon could be relayed in real time via a satellite link back to China, Layton said.
