     Prosecutors drop attempted rape case against Mason Greenwood
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Manchester United footballer Mason Greenwood is no longer facing criminal proceedings over attempted rape after prosecutors dropped the case against him.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was “no longer a realistic prospect of conviction” after key witnesses withdrew their cooperation from the investigation.
Greenwood, 21, was arrested and later charged with attempted rape after an investigation launched in January 2022.
But a review of the case by CPS lawyers has concluded that there was no realistic prospect of conviction given the collapse of the case.
It is understood that the internal probe will look in detail at the allegations made against the forward and the decision by the CPS to drop the case.
