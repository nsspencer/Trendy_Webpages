     Amazon Stock Falls on Mixed Earnings Report and Weak Forecast. AWS Missed Too.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares of Amazon com fell in late trading Thursday after the company posted mixed results for the fourth quarter, reflecting the ongoing pressures from a softening economy.
The company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales growth, but weaker-than-anticipated profits, due largely to a loss on the company’s stake in electric-truck maker Rivian Automotive (ticker: RIVN)

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock wavered in Thursday’s extended trading as the market digested a mixed Q4 earnings report.
Headlining the quarterly results was a big revenue beat, with $149.2B in revenue exceeding analyst estimates by $3.43B.
That slight disappointment was offset by continued rapid growth in advertising revenue and strong North American net sales.
He indicated that this strategy serves the long-term interest of the company even if it stands to hamper quarterly results from time to time.
He added that his team is not looking to optimize quarterly results, but instead build the business and maintain customers for the longer term.
