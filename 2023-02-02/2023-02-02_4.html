     Apple Stock Typically Gains After Earnings. That Could Change This Time.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple reports earnings after the markets close Thursday, and after a quarter of problems for the tech company, investors may be concerned that the stock won’t perform as well as it has in the past.
On average since 2007, the year the iPhone came out, Apple stock has increased 0.3% in the trading session before earnings are released, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
That may not seem like much, but in the session after the release, the stock has an average jump of 1.1%.
The stock has also gained an average of 2.3% the month after earnings.

    </h2>

     Apple stock on wild ride after earnings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple's stock saw an immediate and sharp decline as the company reported earnings that didn't live up to Wall Street's expectations, but as Tim Cook talked about it a strange recovery happened.
Investors generally remain bullish about large entities like Apple, but the quarterly results reflected a rare revenue decline and nearly every metric was below what analysts expected.
Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and Tim Cook both repeatedly pointed to economic uncertainty and issues in Chinese factories as reasons for the miss.
Apple's stock price jumped after hoursApple reported $117.15 billion in revenue for the quarter, which is down from $123.9 billion for the same quarter in 2022.
Services hit a record high, and all categories remained strong except for the $6 billion decline in iPhone revenue year-over-year.
