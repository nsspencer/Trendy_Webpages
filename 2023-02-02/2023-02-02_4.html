    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jessica Simpson has released an Amazon original short story titled, “Movie Star: They Always Say They’re Single.” The project describes an encounter Simpson says she had with an unidentified actor she “grew up thinking was so hot.”It all began, she reveals, when she was five days away with getting back together with fellow singer Nick Lachey, whom she eventually married.
They divorced in 2006 and a producer later told her, “I have somebody who’s been after you forever, and you don’t even know it” connecting her with the Movie Star.
Simpson writes that they met up at the Beverly Hills Hotel while he got ready for an awards show and shared their first kiss.
“He texted me throughout the awards show,” she writes.
“I needed a trophy for this achievement, so I took the pillowcase he slept on,” she wrote.

     Which 'Movie Star' Did Jessica Simpson Detail Having a Quasi Affair With?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jessica Simpson’s game-changing 2020 memoir Open Book was so vivid so often that, when it wasn’t , it was legit frustrating.
“As our mutual friend, my bodyguard, talked, this megastar, who I grew up thinking was so hot, eyeballed me up and down,” Simpson writes.
The most outstanding clue she gives regarding the movie star’s identity is that he wore jeans and a T-shirt to the 2001 VMAs.
None of them were movie stars at the time.
Another clue that tips things toward Wahlberg: Simpson writes, “We had different faiths, but the same reverence for God.” Simpson’s father Joe Simpson was a Baptist minister; Wahlberg is notoriously Catholic.
