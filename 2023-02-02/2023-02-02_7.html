     Summary: Some 500 miles away from the Pro Bowl that he said he was too injured to attend, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen hit a pure wedge shot on Pebble Beach's famed hole No.
It was all part of this week's Pebble Beach Pro-Am, the latest stop on the PGA Tour calendar that invites celebrities and athletes along with professional golfers out to Monterrey, California.
Allen struck a beautiful wedge shot, landing it on the near side of the green that perilously looks out on the Pacific Ocean.
Football fans were quick to point out the odd circumstances surrounding Allen's appearance, considering the Bills quarterback isn't appearing at the NFL's Pro Bowl Games.
This is Allen's second appearance at Pebble Beach, with the QB saying last year, 'If I can golf every day, I would.
