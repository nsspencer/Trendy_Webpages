     Jessica Simpson Claims Married Movie Star Hit On Her
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jessica Simpson has shared a story about a married A-list actor who tried to seduce her more than two decades ago.
“Movie Star started on small talk, and as he leaned in, I had the presence of mind to know, Oh, this is what it’s like to be hit on,” Simpson wrote for Amazon Original Stories.
“Because, other than my ex-boyfriend, no man had ever been so upfront about looking at me in a provocative way.
"'You could be my lead guy,' I offered to this man who made millions and millions per film," she wrote.
Simpson won’t divulge the man’s identity but told People: “I will tell you this… he is still a movie star!”

Now we know the couple know each other, why are internet ‘sleuths’ putting Wahlberg in Simpson’s “movie star” frame?
Mark Wahlberg was also once described by Bro Bible as “if a Dunkin’ Donuts cup could be a person.”Regardless of the online gossip, there is no proof Jessica Simpson is referring to Mark Wahlberg in her essay.

     Jessica Simpson “felt like a call girl” following secret affair with a movie star – KIK-FM 100.7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jessica Simpson once dated her movie star crush, only to find out she was the other woman.
In an excerpt from her short story, Movie Star: They Always Say They’re Single, the singer recalls dating a “massive movie star” who claimed to be single, only to discover a red carpet photo of the unnamed celebrity and his then-girlfriend, according to Us Weekly.
“I was never ever in a million years going to be the other woman,” she writes, asserting that the movie star told her their relationship was “completely over” and he was only interested in pursuing Simpson.
The pair entered into a whirlwind romance, but despite thinking “there was something sexy and enticing” about it, she also believed “there was also something demeaning about it” as well.
“I felt like a call girl,” Simpson, 42, shares, explaining it felt like he was trying to “hide” her from his “chick…I didn’t care if he was my teenage fantasy come to life, this was not a choice that same girl, my younger self, would be proud of.”Movie Star: They Always Say They’re Single is currently available as an ebook and audiobook.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jessica Simpson has released an Amazon original short story titled, “Movie Star: They Always Say They’re Single.” The project describes an encounter Simpson says she had with an unidentified actor she “grew up thinking was so hot.”It all began, she reveals, when she was five days away with getting back together with fellow singer Nick Lachey, whom she eventually married.
They divorced in 2006 and a producer later told her, “I have somebody who’s been after you forever, and you don’t even know it” connecting her with the Movie Star.
Simpson writes that they met up at the Beverly Hills Hotel while he got ready for an awards show and shared their first kiss.
“He texted me throughout the awards show,” she writes.
“I needed a trophy for this achievement, so I took the pillowcase he slept on,” she wrote.

     Which 'Movie Star' Did Jessica Simpson Detail Having a Quasi Affair With?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jessica Simpson’s game-changing 2020 memoir Open Book was so vivid so often that, when it wasn’t , it was legit frustrating.
“As our mutual friend, my bodyguard, talked, this megastar, who I grew up thinking was so hot, eyeballed me up and down,” Simpson writes.
The most outstanding clue she gives regarding the movie star’s identity is that he wore jeans and a T-shirt to the 2001 VMAs.
None of them were movie stars at the time.
Another clue that tips things toward Wahlberg: Simpson writes, “We had different faiths, but the same reverence for God.” Simpson’s father Joe Simpson was a Baptist minister; Wahlberg is notoriously Catholic.
