    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Click here to subscribe to the Sports Hub Underground podcast.)
The Bruins need to give up a big package in order to land a player of Bo Horvat’s caliber.
Despite the 2023 NHL trade deadline being over a month away, the New York Islanders decided to make their big move in late January with the addition of Horvat.
So that now begs the question: if the Bruins want to trade for a true impact player like Horvat, what do they need to give up?
So, what is the Bruins’ baseline?

     Summary: Feb 1, 2023; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Boston Bruins forward Pavel Zacha (18) is congratulated after his goal against the Toronto Maple Leafs during the third period at Scotiabank Arena.
Mandatory Credit: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY SportsOnce sliding to the tune of three straight defeats, the Bruins will ride into the All-Star break on a high thanks to a big victory over the rival Maple Leafs on Wednesday night in Toronto.
Beating the Maple Leafs is always good for a Black and Gold soul, though, and Wednesday night was no exception.
In what was a largely back-and-forth game, the Bruins and Leafs traded punches, and even found themselves engaged in a one-goal game in the third period behind a goal-trading of sorts from the Bruins’ A.J.

     NHL rumors: Bruins 'believed' to be in the market for a left defenseman
    </h2>

     Summary: The Boston Bruins are the favorites to win the Stanley Cup this season, but they could still use some reinforcements before the March 3 NHL trade deadline.
Here's what Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman wrote in his latest 32 Thoughts column Wednesday:"Boston is also believed to be in the left-defence market.
The Bruins are in pretty good shape on the left side of the blue line.
Hampus Lindholm is on pace to set a new single-season career high in points, and he has played like a true top-pairing defenseman all season.
Boston also has veteran defenseman Mike Reilly, who is a left-hand shot, buried in the minors with the AHL's Providence Bruins.

     Summary: The Bruins and Celtics delivered a pair of Wednesday night whoopings against division rivals that should continue to put their respective leagues on notice.
The Bruins horsed around with the Maple Leafs for two periods in Toronto.
In Toronto, the Maple Leafs came away believing they’re close to the Bruins.
Boston has won two of three this season with its division rival, but the Leafs swept the season series last year.
Yet, as close as Toronto might feel it is to the Bruins, there’s still a significant enough gap — and the Maple Leafs know it.

     Summary: Bruins Bruins-Maple Leafs: What we learned as Boston snaps 3-game losing streak The Bruins snapped their only losing streak of the season and head into the All-Star break with a 5-2 win.
The Boston Bruins had hit a rut, seemingly running out of gas following three games in four nights against some of the NHL’s toughest opponents.
Instead, the Bruins addressed the many concerns that arose during their first multi-game losing streak of the year.
Derek Forbort and Brandon Carlo gave Boston their first two leads of the night, occurring at 6:57 and 12:33 of the second period, respectively.

     Summary: Depth shines as Bruins snap skid February 2, 2023, 5:48 PM ET [4 Comments] Anthony TravalgiaBoston Bruins Blogger • Archive • CONTACT Boston Bruins Blogger • RSSRiding into Toronto with a three-game losing streak, the Bruins wanted to enter the All-Star break on a positive note, hoping to put an end to their longest losing streak of the season.
When you’re looking to snap a streak such as the one the Bruins were in, usually it’s your big guns that step up and turn the tide in their favor.
For the Bruins, that means David Pastrnak, that means Patrice Bergeron, David Krejci and Brad Marchand.
But in the Bruins 5-2 win over the Maple Leafs on Thursday it was none of the above that provided the Bruins with the offensive output they needed to snap their streak.
It was fun to watch.”Failing to put together 60-minute efforts during their three-game skid, the Bruins looked more like themselves Thursday.
