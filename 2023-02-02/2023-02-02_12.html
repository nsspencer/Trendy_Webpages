     Cleveland Cavaliers' Donovan Mitchell, Memphis Grizzles' Dillion Brooks ejected after fight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Things turned ugly during the Cleveland Cavaliers and Memphis Grizzlies game.
The Cavaliers' Donovan Mitchell and Grizzlies’ Dillion Brooks were both ejected from Thursday’s matchup at Cleveland’s Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse after the two players were involved in a scuffle that spilled into the stands.
The scuffle happened right in front of the Grizzles' bench, but no Memphis players came off the bench, which would have resulted in more ejections.
Brooks had 9 points in 22 minutes of play, shooting 2-for-5 from the field and 0-for-1 from three.
Last month, several Memphis players got into an altercation with Fox Sports personality and Pro Football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe at the Los Angeles Lakers' Crypto.com Arena.
