     Summary: After beating the Bulls, the LA Clippers made the bus ride from Chicago to Milwaukee to take on the Bucks.
As it pertains to the Bucks, the Clippers do have a few advantages.
The Bucks do not have a natural wing who can guard Kawhi or PG over the course of the game.
This game will also be the Clippers’ fourth straight road game and fourth game in six days.
