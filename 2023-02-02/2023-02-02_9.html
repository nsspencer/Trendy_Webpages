     AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am: Some unfamiliar names among the leaders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PEBBLE BEACH — Of all the traditions stored on the iCloud of golf on the Monterey Peninsula, perhaps the most consistent is that unheralded players often excel early at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.
But Hall, playing in his 16th career PGA Tour event, bogeyed the seventh and finished with two pars for a 64 at MPCC.
Kurt Kitayama, who has two runner-up finishes but is winless in 46 PGA Tour events, had a 64, also at MPCC.
I felt really comfortable out there.
Then just started to feel comfortable with my putter.”Chad Ramey, a one-time PGA Tour winner who has played in 40 career events, had a front-nine 30 at Pebble Beach with four straight birdies beginning on the fourth hole, carded a 65 at Pebble Beach Golf Links.
