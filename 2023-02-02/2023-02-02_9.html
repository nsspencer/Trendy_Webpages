     Jessica Simpson dishes on empowering fling with movie star: 'He was a notch on my own belt'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Simpson reminisced on her fling with a Tinseltown heartthrob, which got its start at an afterparty at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, in the Audible short story “Movie Star: They Always Say They’re Single,” published Wednesday.
The aughties pop star had recently broken up with boyfriend Nick Lachey of 98 Degrees when the 21-year-old met Movie Star, an A-list actor Simpson “grew up thinking was so hot,” at the VMAs afterparty through their mutual friend of Simpson’s bodyguard.
“He texted me throughout the awards show,” Simpson wrote.
“I saw a photo of Movie Star on a red carpet with her,” Simpson recalled.
So, maybe, going forward, I didn’t need to feel as insecure as I thought I was,” Simpson wrote.
