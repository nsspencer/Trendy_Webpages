"Nah," Westbrook told reporters when asked if he brings the criticism home with him.
The Lakers were outscored by a team-worst 26 points when Westbrook was on the floor.

     Sunday night was very bad for the Lakers.
So bad that Lakers fans in attendance were clearly frustrated with the team's performance.
A lot of those harsh criticism was directed at Russell Westbrook, who had another incredibly disappointing shooting performance.
Of everyone, Russ certainly was deserving of the criticism.
It was a really bad night for a team that needs every win they can get.

     Lakers news: LeBron James, Russell Westbrook jawing with fans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It has come down to this for the Los Angeles Lakers, whose playoff chances took another big blow in the form of an embarrassing 123-95 home loss to the New Orleans Pelicans Sunday night.
What a way to end the weekend for Lakers fans, huh — especially for those who went at it with LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, and Trevor Ariza and got spicy responses from the same players.
The fans are understandably mad and venting frustrations on Lakers players isn’t really the most ideal way to boost the latter’s morale.
They have only won once in their last six games, dating back to the first half of the season.
It’s not about to get any easier for LeBron James and the Lakers, as they will be facing Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks at home this coming Tuesday before taking on the Los Angeles Clippers, who appear to have their number, on Thursday.

However, the Lakers guard recently decided to make a notable change as his wife, Nina Westbrook, revealed that her husband is taking a break from using social media.
Over the last few months, he has likely heard and seen it all play out over social media.

"Right now, the 27-33 Lakers are tumbling backward, with the loss to the No.
That's what it starts with," he said when asked how L.A. can begin to turn things around.
"Try to get off of this slide and get a win, and learn from that win with things you did well, things that you didn't do so well.
"Teams are coming in, playing harder, and I believe that's kind of their scouting report: Just play harder than them and see what happens," Westbrook said.

Frustrations among the Los Angeles Lakers fan base are at an all-time high following their latest defeat.
But one fan decided to take things too far last night, heckling players sitting on the bench.
During the game against the Pelicans, one fan sitting close to the bench was audibly heckling players throughout the game.
Several Lakers players were booed, including Russell Westbrook.

     The Lakers nixed a big trade and went after Russell Westbrook instead. Now it looks like a mistake.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Lakers reportedly had a trade in place for Buddy Hield when they pursued Russell Westbrook.
The Lakers went all-in to acquire Russell Westbrook in a trade with the Washington Wizards, sending away Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and their 2021 first-round pick.
The deal essentially stripped the roster bare, leaving just LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Westbrook, while leaving the Lakers with very few assets left to trade.
It's a big "what-if" for the Lakers: what if they had traded for Buddy Hield instead of Westbrook?
Instead, the Lakers backed out to acquire Westbrook, thanks to some pressure from James, who wanted another playmaker on the team.

Midway through the third quarter with the Lakers trailing by 19 points, James tried a baseline bounce pass that did not come close.
As James headed to the other end of the court, fans at Crypto.com Arena even booed the team and its superstar.
I ain’t worried about that, doesn’t bother me, that’s the part and I’m not really worried about it at all.
