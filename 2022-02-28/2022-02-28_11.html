     Stock Market Today: Dow Slid With Ukraine in Focus, Oil Surges, Gold Pops
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stocks were mixed Monday after news over the weekend that the U.S. is imposing new sanctions on Russia.
The good news: the Federal Reserve may be less inclined to be aggressive in hiking interest rates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 179 points or 0.5%, after the index ended 834 points higher Friday.
The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.4%, as investors favored tech stocks over the Dow’s largely more economically-sensitive names.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The collapse of the Russian ruble following the latest round of sanctions from the United States and Western Europe may be manna from heaven for cryptocurrency bulls.
That's because the ruble's fall is a sign that government-backed currencies, which are typically viewed as being relatively safe, can still be incredibly risky.
Bitcoin prices surged more than 10% Monday to above $41,500, their highest level in nearly two weeks.
"Bitcoin and all the top altcoins are rallying today as investors realize the likelihood of massive investments into DeFi following the latest round of Russian sanctions," he added.
To that end, the price of ethereum — the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency after bitcoin — surged more than 8%, while binance coin and XRP were each up about 7%.

     Dow drops 167 points in tense trade as oil spikes on Russian war
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     US stocks dropped on Monday and oil prices spiked as nervous investors eyed the war in Ukraine and Russia’s next move.
“The fear over the weekend was the potential likelihood of global financial crisis, but that concern has quieted significantly,” Schiffer said.
The finance sector is being squeezed as bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase were down, with JPM falling 4%.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch an offensive against Ukraine prompted the West to impose sanctions on Moscow.
More broadly, the markets situation was so dire that the Russian central bank prevented the stock market from opening in Moscow.

     Dow Falls 200 Points, Nasdaq Turns Positive As Investors Weigh Latest Sanctions On Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Markets continue to take a hit from ongoing uncertainty around the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Sergey Bobok/AFP via Getty ImagesKey FactsThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5%, nearly 200 points, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4%.
While stocks have taken a hit from the ongoing hostilities, “investors will obviously be watching very closely” for updates on the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.
Key Background:Markets have undergone volatile trading in recent weeks as tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated, with Russian President Vladimir Putin officially launching his invasion of the country last Thursday.
Stocks rebounded strongly on Friday—with the Dow jumping 800 points for its best day since late 2020—as reports first emerged about Russia saying it would be open to talks with Ukraine.
