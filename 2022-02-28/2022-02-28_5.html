     Lakers Game for the Birds Against Pelicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Lakers hosted the New Orleans Pelicans for the last Sunday in February.
It was a difficult game; Los Angeles allowed the Pelicans to pick up the 123-95 win.
Their shortcomings were likely a result of Los Angeles’ lack of control.
Nola was also extremely effective with their fast break, they more than doubled the Lakers’ points in transition.
As the team looks towards March, the Lakers will return for a home game against the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday.

     Lakers preseason ESPN graphic goes viral amid team’s recent struggles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Unfortunately, the “depth” that the Lakers amassed in the offseason hasn’t been on display for most of the year.
Two other notable veterans from the preseason Lakers graphic, Marc Gasol and Rajon Rondo, are no longer on the team.
Los Angeles traded away both and landed little from Memphis and Cleveland in return.
Although the team likely won’t miss out on the playoffs entirely, Los Angeles has a long way to go to prove that it belongs in the conversation about championship contenders.

As LeBron James talked to the media after the game, the flag on the microphone he was holding slid down and hit his hand.
In the eyes of Lakers coach Frank Vogel, there is only one thing for the Lakers to do after losing so badly to the Pelicans.
We’ll meet and figure out what type of adjustments we got to make and just turn the page to Dallas.”

     LeBron James gets booed by Lakers fans, Russell Westbrook says he's not worried
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LeBron James had 32 points and 7 turnovers while Russell Westbrook had 16 points on 5/15 shooting from the field with 7 turnovers.
Midway through the third quarter with the Lakers trailing by 19 points, James tried a baseline bounce pass that did not come close.
As James headed to the other end of the court, fans at Crypto.com Arena even booed the team and its superstar.
I ain’t worried about that, doesn’t bother me, that’s the part and I’m not really worried about it at all.
LeBron James said he's determined to improve down the road, pointing out that making seven turnovers is not exactly the recipe for success.
