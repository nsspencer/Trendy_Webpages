     Florida Lottery makes history with new, $50 scratch-off game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     TALLAHASSEE – The Florida Lottery announced a new scratch-off game on Monday which features a top prize of $25 million—the largest ever offered on a Florida Scratch-Off game.
500X THE CASH Scratch-Off game is a $50 ticket that features more than $1.5 billion in cash prizes and the best odds to become an instant millionaire.
The new 500X THE CASH game joins the X THE CASH family of Scratch-Off games that launched in January, featuring a combined total of more than $2.2 billion in prizes.
The Florida Lottery is also introducing three additional Scratch-Off games today: DOUBLE YOUR MONEY, BONUS CASH, and WILD DOUGH.
These games, and the 500X THE CASH game, are expected to be available at all Lottery retailers within 48 hours.
