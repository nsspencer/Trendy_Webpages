     NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal says without Lebron James, the Lakers will never win again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal issued a stark warning to the Los Angeles Lakers Monday, saying despite an abysmal season, it would be a huge mistake to trade the team's biggest superstar, Lebron James.
"If you trade LeBron, you'll never win again," O'Neal said of the Lakers in an interview with CNBC.
While the NBA trade deadline has passed, James' contract with the Lakers expires in 2023.
O'Neal himself played eight seasons with the Lakers, leading the team to three championships alongside Kobe Bryant.
O'Neal, who also serves as an TNT Broadcaster, said Monday the Lakers should be focusing on surrounding James with the right set of players.

     Lakers Should Seriously Consider Buying Out Kent Bazemore

     He got the start in the first 13 games of the Lakers season, and he was supposed to be a big part of the scheme.
Yes, he offers speed and defensive tenacity at the wing, which the Lakers need.
Bazemore has a $2.4 million salary for this year that comes off of the books at the end of the season.
The Lakers were already reportedly interested in getting him out of Los Angeles before the deadline, possibly in preparation for a move.
He was excited to come to the Lakers, but things just haven't worked out and he's been relegated to a very low-minutes role.

It doesn’t bother me none.”Sunday’s loss was the Lakers’ ninth defeat in the past 12 games, dipping their record to 27-33.

     All the boos the Lakers encountered during their uninspiring 28-point loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday night was just one of many things they had to face.
After he scored 16 points, but had just one assist and seven turnovers, Russell Westbrook was asked if the booing bothered him.
The Lakers committed 23 of them, including seven each by James and Westbrook.
“Obviously seven turnovers is not an ingredient for winning basketball for myself.
In the eyes of Lakers coach Frank Vogel, there is only one thing for the Lakers to do after losing so badly to the Pelicans.

     Laker fans may not be happy with Russell Westbrook — Los Angeles traded a team’s worth of depth to land Westbrook, and he has not meshed next to LeBron James — but Westbrook is happy.
Sunday night, the boos rained down on the Lakers during an ugly home loss to the Pelicans.
Lakers fans let their stars hear about it, and the Lakers’ stars jawed back, including Westbrook.
It doesn’t bother me none.”From the Lakers’ perspective, this is a “flush it” game — every team has a few of those a season.
That doesn’t mean Westbrook should bring his work troubles home with him, but he can’t be dismissive of them either — this is a bad Lakers team, and he is at the heart of the problem.

The grim reality is that the Lakers are much, much closer to falling out of the play-in game entirely than playing their way up the seedings.
But even that’s not an option for a Lakers team who doesn’t own their first round pick.
Specifically, this Lakers team was seen as one of those championship contenders before the season started.

As James headed to the other end of the court, fans at Crypto.com Arena even booed the team and its superstar.
I ain’t worried about that, doesn’t bother me, that’s the part and I’m not really worried about it at all.
LeBron James said he's determined to improve down the road, pointing out that making seven turnovers is not exactly the recipe for success.
