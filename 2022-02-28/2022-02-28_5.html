     Stocks were mixed Monday after news over the weekend that the U.S. is imposing new sanctions on Russia.
The good news: the Federal Reserve may be less inclined to be aggressive in hiking interest rates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 179 points or 0.5%, after the index ended 834 points higher Friday.
The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3%, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.4%, as investors favored tech stocks over the Dow’s largely more economically-sensitive names.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The collapse of the Russian ruble following the latest round of sanctions from the United States and Western Europe may be manna from heaven for cryptocurrency bulls.
That's because the ruble's fall is a sign that government-backed currencies, which are typically viewed as being relatively safe, can still be incredibly risky.
Bitcoin prices surged more than 10% Monday to above $41,500, their highest level in nearly two weeks.
"Bitcoin and all the top altcoins are rallying today as investors realize the likelihood of massive investments into DeFi following the latest round of Russian sanctions," he added.
To that end, the price of ethereum — the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency after bitcoin — surged more than 8%, while binance coin and XRP were each up about 7%.
