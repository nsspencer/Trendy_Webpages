     For months now, compliance with the mandate in the Capitol complex has been spotty and partisan.
But on the House floor, the House sergeant-at-arms has diligently enforced the mask mandate and reported scofflaws to the House Ethics Committee.
Compliance on the Senate side of the Capitol was far looser, with no real consequences to ignoring the mandate.
The date for the president’s State of the Union address is later this year than is traditional — it will be the first to be delivered in March.
Those who were allowed to attend were instructed to wear masks, and they sat with several empty seats separating them from other audience members.

     WASHINGTON — Masks will be optional for members of Congress and others attending President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday, the Capitol's attending physician, Brian P. Monahan, said in a notice Sunday.
The notice said that KN95 or N95 masks are no longer required, and wearing a mask "is now an individual choice option."
He noted that the Washington, D.C. region is now in the "green level," or a low level of risk that allows for reduced coronavirus prevention measures.
Many Republican lawmakers on the Hill went without masks even under the requirement to wear them in the House.
Biden is slated to deliver his first State of the Union address as president at 9 p.m.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Congress is lifting its mask requirement on the House floor, making face coverings optional for President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on Tuesday.
Federal regulators eased guidelines last week in a rethinking of the nation’s strategy to adapt to living with COVID-19.
Congress’ Office of the Attending Physician announced the policy change Sunday, lifting a requirement that has been in place for much of the past two years on Capitol Hill.
Mask-wearing will still be a personal choice in Congress and special precautions will be in place for Biden’s speech.
All attendees will be required to take a COVID-19 test before entering the chamber ahead of Biden’s address.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     President Biden plans to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress on March 1, as the Democrat tries to rally support for his agenda with lawmakers and voters headed into the midterm elections.
The high-profile speech is often a touchstone moment for presidents, and just a few weeks ago, White House aides had envisioned the evening as a chance for Mr. Biden to focus on plans to fight inflation, promote accomplishments and restore some sense of normalcy after two years of Covid-19.
But with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last week, the speech will now take place against the backdrop of the largest ground war in Europe since World War II.
Foreign policy will be front and center.

Just months away, democrats are hoping biden state of the Union address provides a much needed boost to his struggling presidency.
State of the Union guests help put a human face on a president's message for both policymakers and viewers at home.Presidents often mention some guests by name in their State of the Union speech to highlight policy goals or achievements.
Acknowledging guests like this is a tradition that goes back to Ronald Reagan's 1982 address, according to the University of California-Santa Barbara's American Presidency Project.Presidents have traditionally acknowledged some of their State of the Union guests during their speeches ever since.
In 2008, one of his guests was Irvin Mayfield, a legendary jazz trumpeter and appointed cultural ambassador of New Orleans.

As the White House seeks to strike the right tone between touting accomplishments and acknowledging pain, there has been no shortage of outside advice.
The White House has signaled to activists, for example, that Biden will use the address to sell the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package that he signed into law in November.
Climate activists have been pushing the White House to use the speech to elevate the need for clean energy incentives and renew his call for electrifying the country’s transportation system.
The White House is wary of appearing to try to browbeat senators into confirming her, they said.
