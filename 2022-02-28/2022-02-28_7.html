     Deadline Day Arrives as M.L.B. and Players Continue Negotiations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     JUPITER, Fla. — On Monday, minutes before 10 a.m., members of the negotiating team from the Major League Baseball players’ union made their daily walk from the parking lot of Roger Dean Stadium into their meeting room.
Among the group: the veteran pitchers Andrew Miller and Max Scherzer, both top union representatives.
But after making little progress toward a new labor deal with the union last week, the league doubled down on its position with a threat.
M.L.B., which locked out the players on Dec. 2, told the union on Wednesday that it was serious about its self-imposed deadline, Monday, for reaching a new collective bargaining agreement in order to begin the 162-game season as scheduled.
If that deadline was not met, the league said, it would begin canceling games, not pay players for those missed games and not reschedule them.

     After a weekend of negotiations that reportedly saw progress toward a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between MLB and MLB players, there’s hope that further negotiations today and tonight will yield a deal.
), a deal reached tomorrow or Wednesday may not impact an immediate launch to training before a March 8 start to games in what would be a slightly shortened spring training.
If a deal cannot be reached soon, we could see the beginning of the regular season, now set for March 31, delayed.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As MLB and the players’ union appear to both be unyielding in their stances regarding the labor negotiations in Jupitar, Florida, the cancellation of regular season games might be inevitable.
Per reports, MLB is steadfast in its willingness to cancel games, including the first full month of the regular season.
MLB today indicated a willingness to miss a month of games and took a more threatening tone than yesterday, sources briefed on the day’s first meeting between MLB and the Players Association tell me, @Ken_Rosenthal and @FabianArdaya.
The regular season is/was scheduled to start on March 31.
As @EvanDrellich said, MLB suggested in the first meeting with the MLBPA today that the league is willing to cancel a month's worth of games.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Today is the day in which Major League Baseball has dictated that an agreement needs to be reached in order for the season to start on time.
You know, to end a lockout that they instigated, followed by weeks of no attempts to negotiate from them, followed by an absolute unwillingness to actively negotiate with the MLBPA.
There’s only one side actually trying to start the season on time and it isn’t the owners.
How many days has it been since the owners locked out the players?
90 days, and it looks like we might as well start hunkering down for another 90 days.

     It was the eighth straight day of talks at the vacant spring training home of the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals.
Monday was picked as a deadline because Manfred says at least 28 days of training are needed before the season starts.
The union has not said whether it agrees, and baseball has shortened spring training to as few as three weeks in the past.
Spring training games were to have begun Saturday and already have been canceled through March 7.
Players and teams entered deadline day far apart on many key issues and unresolved on others.

Talks are expected to continue Tuesday, with MLB extending its self-imposed deadline.
But with the sides chipping away, there was overnight resolve to blow past MLB’s artificial deadline and continue talking.
But MLB waited 43 days before re-engaging the players in talks on core economics.
“Somehow, during those four negotiations, players and union representatives figured out a way to trust me enough to make a deal.”That streak was being tested early Tuesday morning.

     Most knew that Monday represented a decisive day in the negotiations between MLB owners and the MLB Players Association taking place thousands of miles away in Jupiter, Florida.
But MLB players, including several Mariners, increased their criticism of the situation on social media.
Several MLB players have already been in Arizona working out privately.
If and when an agreement is reached, how long will they have for a spring training.
The three-week spring training going into the COVID-shortened 2020 season proved to be less than ideal and was the blame for several injuries.

     Monday marked the league's self-imposed deadline for when a new collective bargaining agreement must be reached before regular-season games are canceled.
This would mark the first time in 27 years that regular-season contests are impacted by a work stoppage.
As the clock struck midnight in Jupiter, Florida (where negotiations are happening) the MLBPA and MLB continued to talk.
The two sides could continue negotiations on Tuesday and avoid pushing Opening Day back despite the league's deadline, adds ESPN's Jeff Passan.
CBS Sports is providing live updates of Monday's and now Tuesday's negotiations.
