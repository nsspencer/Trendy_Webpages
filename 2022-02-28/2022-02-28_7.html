     MLB prepared to miss a month of games, reports say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     As MLB and the players’ union appear to both be unyielding in their stances regarding the labor negotiations in Jupitar, Florida, the cancellation of regular season games might be inevitable.
Per reports, MLB is steadfast in its willingness to cancel games, including the first full month of the regular season.
MLB today indicated a willingness to miss a month of games and took a more threatening tone than yesterday, sources briefed on the day’s first meeting between MLB and the Players Association tell me, @Ken_Rosenthal and @FabianArdaya.
The regular season is/was scheduled to start on March 31.
As @EvanDrellich said, MLB suggested in the first meeting with the MLBPA today that the league is willing to cancel a month's worth of games.

If a deal cannot be reached soon, we could see the beginning of the regular season, now set for March 31, delayed.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Today is the day in which Major League Baseball has dictated that an agreement needs to be reached in order for the season to start on time.
You know, to end a lockout that they instigated, followed by weeks of no attempts to negotiate from them, followed by an absolute unwillingness to actively negotiate with the MLBPA.
There’s only one side actually trying to start the season on time and it isn’t the owners.
How many days has it been since the owners locked out the players?
90 days, and it looks like we might as well start hunkering down for another 90 days.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It was the eighth straight day of talks at the vacant spring training home of the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals.
Monday was picked as a deadline because Manfred says at least 28 days of training are needed before the season starts.
The union has not said whether it agrees, and baseball has shortened spring training to as few as three weeks in the past.
Spring training games were to have begun Saturday and already have been canceled through March 7.
Players and teams entered deadline day far apart on many key issues and unresolved on others.

     Most knew that Monday represented a decisive day in the negotiations between MLB owners and the MLB Players Association taking place thousands of miles away in Jupiter, Florida.
But MLB players, including several Mariners, increased their criticism of the situation on social media.
Several MLB players have already been in Arizona working out privately.
If and when an agreement is reached, how long will they have for a spring training.
The three-week spring training going into the COVID-shortened 2020 season proved to be less than ideal and was the blame for several injuries.

     You can binge one of those comedies that don’t tell jokes but do make you vaguely feel better.
What it looks like you can’t do, on that final day in March, is watch Major League Baseball.
That the union slept at the wheel for years and woke up wondering how the industry landed in a ditch is not worth rehashing.
The owners have refused to budge on the relatively modest requests made by the players for a more equitable piece of the industry’s massive revenue pie.
The players are willing to grow the pie by diluting the playoffs and sullying their uniforms with ads.

     Monday marked the league's self-imposed deadline for when a new collective bargaining agreement must be reached before regular-season games are canceled.
This would mark the first time in 27 years that regular-season contests are impacted by a work stoppage.
As the clock struck midnight in Jupiter, Florida (where negotiations are happening) the MLBPA and MLB continued to talk.
The two sides could continue negotiations on Tuesday and avoid pushing Opening Day back despite the league's deadline, adds ESPN's Jeff Passan.

     For a deal to be agreed upon, MLB will have to both significantly lower its luxury tax rate proposals on all three levels and significantly increase its proposed luxury tax thresholds.
MLB’s current first luxury tax threshold stands at $214 million for the 2022 season.
The MLBPA is seeking a $245 million threshold in 2022 with the monetary luxury tax penalties remaining the same relative to the last agreement.
As you can see above, the league doesn’t appear willing to raise the luxury tax thresholds much, if at all.
