     Deadline Day Arrives as M.L.B. and Players Continue Negotiations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     JUPITER, Fla. — On Monday, minutes before 10 a.m., members of the negotiating team from the Major League Baseball players’ union made their daily walk from the parking lot of Roger Dean Stadium into their meeting room.
Among the group: the veteran pitchers Andrew Miller and Max Scherzer, both top union representatives.
But after making little progress toward a new labor deal with the union last week, the league doubled down on its position with a threat.
M.L.B., which locked out the players on Dec. 2, told the union on Wednesday that it was serious about its self-imposed deadline, Monday, for reaching a new collective bargaining agreement in order to begin the 162-game season as scheduled.
If that deadline was not met, the league said, it would begin canceling games, not pay players for those missed games and not reschedule them.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After a weekend of negotiations that reportedly saw progress toward a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between MLB and MLB players, there’s hope that further negotiations today and tonight will yield a deal.
), a deal reached tomorrow or Wednesday may not impact an immediate launch to training before a March 8 start to games in what would be a slightly shortened spring training.
If a deal cannot be reached soon, we could see the beginning of the regular season, now set for March 31, delayed.

     MLB: Joey Gallo y otros peloteros ya buscan trabajo en otras ligas por el parón
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Las horas pasan y el inicio de la Temporada 2022 de la MLB continúa en duda.
Ésto ha llevado que los peloteros comiencen a buscar otras opciones de dónde pasar su año.
Tal es el caso de Joey Gallo de los Yankees de Nueva York, quien se encuentra buscando trabajo en otras ligas y ya hasta modificó su currículum en LinkedIn.
Ésto se debería a que la MLB y la MLBPA aún no logran firmar un nuevo acuerdo y el parón patronal sigue vigente.
Major League Baseball (MLB) y el Sindicato de Peloteros de la MLB (MLBPA) aún no logran firmar un nuevo acuerdo que ponga fin al parón patronal y que permita que la Liga continúe su curso este año.

     The MLB-imposed deadline to end the MLB-imposed lockout is here
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Today is the day in which Major League Baseball has dictated that an agreement needs to be reached in order for the season to start on time.
You know, to end a lockout that they instigated, followed by weeks of no attempts to negotiate from them, followed by an absolute unwillingness to actively negotiate with the MLBPA.
There’s only one side actually trying to start the season on time and it isn’t the owners.
How many days has it been since the owners locked out the players?
90 days, and it looks like we might as well start hunkering down for another 90 days.

     MLB: It’s deadline day to save opening day, 162-game season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It was the eighth straight day of talks at the vacant spring training home of the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals.
Monday was picked as a deadline because Manfred says at least 28 days of training are needed before the season starts.
The union has not said whether it agrees, and baseball has shortened spring training to as few as three weeks in the past.
Spring training games were to have begun Saturday and already have been canceled through March 7.
Players and teams entered deadline day far apart on many key issues and unresolved on others.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The luxury tax, minimum salary, pre-arbitration bonus pool, and expanded playoffs were all on the table in the 11th-hour back-and-forth.
Talks are expected to continue Tuesday, with MLB extending its self-imposed deadline to 5 p.m.
The players were also vowing to veto expanding the playoffs, the owners’ greatest desire in a new agreement.
But MLB waited 43 days before re-engaging the players in talks on core economics.
“Somehow, during those four negotiations, players and union representatives figured out a way to trust me enough to make a deal.”That streak was being tested early Tuesday morning.

     "We want to exhaust every possibility to get a deal done," a league spokesman said.
The union also dropped its proposal to increase the number of arbitration-eligible players with two years' service from 22%.
"We're working at it," Manfred said around 6 p.m. after his second session of the day with the union.
Owners and players initially converged Feb. 21 at the spring training site of the St. Louis Cardinals, holding face-to-face meetings for eight straight days.
The rest of that season was canceled, including the most lucrative time of the year for the league -- the postseason.
