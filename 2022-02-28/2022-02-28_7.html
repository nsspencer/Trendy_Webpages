     Will Ashtray Be In 'Euphoria' Season 3? Javon Walton Has A Theory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Euphoria Season 2 ended with a finale so explosive even viewers’ extensive plot theories couldn’t predict what was going to happen.
In a new interview with Esquire, however, actor Javon Walton says he hopes Ashtray is alive and returns for Season 3.
After playing dead, Ashtray then shot and killed a police officer before a gun’s red dot centered on his head.
“You know that Fez needs Ash, and Ash needs Fez.
While it seems unlikely, Walton thinks Ashtray could’ve played dead through the police shootout and gotten out alive.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fez pleads with Ashtray to let him take the fall, because they know the police are literally on their way.
The FBI enter the home and there's a shootout between the FBI officers and Ashtray, who's hiding in the bathtub.
For a second, the shooting stops, and it seems like Ashtray was shot.
An FBI officer approaches the bathroom door, opens it, and Ashtray is laying on the ground, as if he's dead.
He went on to talk about what he thinks could happen in season 3, if Ashtray somehow survived.

     ‘Euphoria’s’ Javon Walton Shares Last-Minute Changes to Season 2 Finale: ‘Ashtray Wasn’t Supposed to [SPOILER]’

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It seems unlikely, but some people think Ashtray might still be alive.
At the end of the day, he’s a kid, you know?
But there’s been a few times like that, where Ashtray was supposed to have certain dialogue and Sam just decided to cut it because he likes [that with] Ashtray, there’s a lot of mystery behind him.
[In the finale], I don’t think there’s much he could say.
But as he’s matured, he’s really changed almost for the worst.
