     For months now, compliance with the mandate in the Capitol complex has been spotty and partisan.
But on the House floor, the House sergeant-at-arms has diligently enforced the mask mandate and reported scofflaws to the House Ethics Committee.
Compliance on the Senate side of the Capitol was far looser, with no real consequences to ignoring the mandate.
The date for the president’s State of the Union address is later this year than is traditional — it will be the first to be delivered in March.
Those who were allowed to attend were instructed to wear masks, and they sat with several empty seats separating them from other audience members.

     Masks optional for Biden's State of the Union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Masks will be optional for members of Congress and others attending President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday, the Capitol's attending physician, Brian P. Monahan, said in a notice Sunday.
The notice said that KN95 or N95 masks are no longer required, and wearing a mask "is now an individual choice option."
He noted that the Washington, D.C. region is now in the "green level," or a low level of risk that allows for reduced coronavirus prevention measures.
Many Republican lawmakers on the Hill went without masks even under the requirement to wear them in the House.
Biden is slated to deliver his first State of the Union address as president at 9 p.m.

     No longer on the State of the Union guest list: Mandatory masks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Mask wearing is no longer required on the House side of the Capitol, and won’t be mandatory at Tuesday’s State of the Union address, the Office of the Attending Physician announced.
“Individuals may choose to mask at any time, but it is no longer a requirement,” a letter sent to House staff Sunday night said.
The OAP move mirrors a Friday announcement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said masks could come off in most areas of the country.
The Washington area is currently at a low risk level for COVID-19, according to a new metric unveiled by the CDC.
But the testing center at the Capitol Visitor Center will remain open and available for walk-in testing.

     Congress lifts mask requirement ahead of State of the Union address
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Congress is lifting its mask requirement on the House floor, making face coverings optional for President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on Tuesday.
Federal regulators eased guidelines last week in a rethinking of the nation’s strategy to adapt to living with COVID-19.
Congress’ Office of the Attending Physician announced the policy change Sunday, lifting a requirement that has been in place for much of the past two years on Capitol Hill.
Mask-wearing will still be a personal choice in Congress and special precautions will be in place for Biden’s speech.
All attendees will be required to take a COVID-19 test before entering the chamber ahead of Biden’s address.

     White House press secretary later said the president will "absolutely" reference inflation directly.
"It's time for Congress to get him a piece of legislation that addresses those core challenges for families right now."
Addressing those issues — like child care, family and medical leave, energy costs and health care premiums — would lower costs for families, administration officials argued.
"The president is proud of the administration's progress to date," and will continue to build on it, one official on the call said.

The White House aides offered a blizzard of statistics that will be used to sell the roughly $2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan passed into law last year.
White House officials cautioned late Sunday that the speech was still in flux and noted that elements and even major themes sometimes get dropped from the final version.

Biden aides briefing reporters on the speech Monday afternoon would not say whether Biden would mention his onetime signature legislation by name.
