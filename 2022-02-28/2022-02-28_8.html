     Masks optional for Biden's State of the Union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Masks will be optional for members of Congress and others attending President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday, the Capitol's attending physician, Brian P. Monahan, said in a notice Sunday.
The notice said that KN95 or N95 masks are no longer required, and wearing a mask "is now an individual choice option."
He noted that the Washington, D.C. region is now in the "green level," or a low level of risk that allows for reduced coronavirus prevention measures.
Many Republican lawmakers on the Hill went without masks even under the requirement to wear them in the House.
Biden is slated to deliver his first State of the Union address as president at 9 p.m.

New York City’s vaccine mandate for indoor dining, movie theaters and gyms, known as the Key to NYC program, was imposed by Mr. Adams’s predecessor, Bill de Blasio.
“The business community is eager to get beyond pandemic conditions and restrictions,” said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City.

Just months away, democrats are hoping biden state of the Union address provides a much needed boost to his struggling presidency.
State of the Union guests help put a human face on a president's message for both policymakers and viewers at home.Presidents often mention some guests by name in their State of the Union speech to highlight policy goals or achievements.
Acknowledging guests like this is a tradition that goes back to Ronald Reagan's 1982 address, according to the University of California-Santa Barbara's American Presidency Project.Presidents have traditionally acknowledged some of their State of the Union guests during their speeches ever since.
In 2008, one of his guests was Irvin Mayfield, a legendary jazz trumpeter and appointed cultural ambassador of New Orleans.

As the White House seeks to strike the right tone between touting accomplishments and acknowledging pain, there has been no shortage of outside advice.
The White House has signaled to activists, for example, that Biden will use the address to sell the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package that he signed into law in November.
Climate activists have been pushing the White House to use the speech to elevate the need for clean energy incentives and renew his call for electrifying the country’s transportation system.
The White House is wary of appearing to try to browbeat senators into confirming her, they said.

     Congress lifts mask requirement ahead of State of the Union address

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Congress is lifting its mask requirement on the House floor, making face coverings optional for President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on Tuesday.
Federal regulators eased guidelines last week in a rethinking of the nation’s strategy to adapt to living with COVID-19.
Congress’ Office of the Attending Physician announced the policy change Sunday, lifting a requirement that has been in place for much of the past two years on Capitol Hill.
Mask-wearing will still be a personal choice in Congress and special precautions will be in place for Biden’s speech.
All attendees will be required to take a COVID-19 test before entering the chamber ahead of Biden’s address.
