    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For months now, compliance with the mandate in the Capitol complex has been spotty and partisan.
But on the House floor, the House sergeant-at-arms has diligently enforced the mask mandate and reported scofflaws to the House Ethics Committee.
Compliance on the Senate side of the Capitol was far looser, with no real consequences to ignoring the mandate.
The date for the president’s State of the Union address is later this year than is traditional — it will be the first to be delivered in March.
Those who were allowed to attend were instructed to wear masks, and they sat with several empty seats separating them from other audience members.

     Masks optional for Biden's State of the Union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Masks will be optional for members of Congress and others attending President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday, the Capitol's attending physician, Brian P. Monahan, said in a notice Sunday.
The notice said that KN95 or N95 masks are no longer required, and wearing a mask "is now an individual choice option."
He noted that the Washington, D.C. region is now in the "green level," or a low level of risk that allows for reduced coronavirus prevention measures.
Many Republican lawmakers on the Hill went without masks even under the requirement to wear them in the House.
Biden is slated to deliver his first State of the Union address as president at 9 p.m.

     No longer on the State of the Union guest list: Mandatory masks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Mask wearing is no longer required on the House side of the Capitol, and won’t be mandatory at Tuesday’s State of the Union address, the Office of the Attending Physician announced.
“Individuals may choose to mask at any time, but it is no longer a requirement,” a letter sent to House staff Sunday night said.
The OAP move mirrors a Friday announcement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said masks could come off in most areas of the country.
The Washington area is currently at a low risk level for COVID-19, according to a new metric unveiled by the CDC.
But the testing center at the Capitol Visitor Center will remain open and available for walk-in testing.

     When Is Biden’s State of the Union? What to Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     President Biden plans to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress on March 1, as the Democrat tries to rally support for his agenda with lawmakers and voters headed into the midterm elections.
The high-profile speech is often a touchstone moment for presidents, and just a few weeks ago, White House aides had envisioned the evening as a chance for Mr. Biden to focus on plans to fight inflation, promote accomplishments and restore some sense of normalcy after two years of Covid-19.
But with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last week, the speech will now take place against the backdrop of the largest ground war in Europe since World War II.
Foreign policy will be front and center.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In their State of the Union speeches, they declare “the state of our union is strong” or words very much like it.
President Joe Biden’s fellow Americans, though, have other ideas about the state they’re in and little hope that his speech Tuesday can turn anything around.
The state of the union is disunity.
It is so low that some Americans, even prominent ones, are exalting Russian President Vladimir Putin in his attack on a democracy.
But Vice President Kamala Harris told an interviewer last month “there is a level of malaise” in this country.

     AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“This is a dicey one,” Christopher Dodd, former senator from Connecticut and a close Biden friend, said of the address.
The White House aides offered a blizzard of statistics that will be used to sell the roughly $2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan passed into law last year.
White House officials cautioned late Sunday that the speech was still in flux and noted that elements and even major themes sometimes get dropped from the final version.
As the White House seeks to strike the right tone between touting accomplishments and acknowledging pain, there has been no shortage of outside advice.
Biden aides briefing reporters on the speech Monday afternoon would not say whether Biden would mention his onetime signature legislation by name.
