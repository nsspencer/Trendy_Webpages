     White House officials and their allies on Capitol Hill fear they could lose control of both chambers if Mr. Biden is unable to turn those numbers around.
Officials said Mr. Biden will also announce new steps to confront price increases caused by a lack of competition.
Those companies have significantly increased their shipping rates through the pandemic, the White House said on Monday.
The Justice Department and the Federal Maritime Commission together will crack down on antitrust violations among shipping companies, to try to bring more competition into the sector.
Federal shipping regulators will also step up their oversight of certain practices by shipping companies, like unfair fees.

     Masks optional for Biden's State of the Union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Masks will be optional for members of Congress and others attending President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday, the Capitol's attending physician, Brian P. Monahan, said in a notice Sunday.
The notice said that KN95 or N95 masks are no longer required, and wearing a mask "is now an individual choice option."
He noted that the Washington, D.C. region is now in the "green level," or a low level of risk that allows for reduced coronavirus prevention measures.
Many Republican lawmakers on the Hill went without masks even under the requirement to wear them in the House.
Biden is slated to deliver his first State of the Union address as president at 9 p.m.

     White House press secretary later said the president will "absolutely" reference inflation directly.
"It's time for Congress to get him a piece of legislation that addresses those core challenges for families right now."
Addressing those issues — like child care, family and medical leave, energy costs and health care premiums — would lower costs for families, administration officials argued.
"The president is proud of the administration's progress to date," and will continue to build on it, one official on the call said.
The president's State of the Union address will air at 9 p.m.

     State of the Union 2022: What to know ahead of Biden's speech

     The White House will stream it live on its website, as will news networks through Facebook.
Going back to Lyndon B. Johnson, the average length of presidents’ State of the Union remarks is roughly 50 minutes.
Biden’s immediate predecessor, Donald Trump, delivered three State of the Union addresses, all surpassing one hour in length.
Trump’s 2019 speech lasted 1 hour and 22 minutes, the third-longest State of the Union address ever.
Bill Clinton holds the record for the longest State of the Union speech, lasting 1 hour and 29 minutes, according to the American Presidency Project.

     Biden hoped to spark a political reset at home with his first State of the Union address. A war in Europe changed those plans.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Biden and his team have revised portions of his speech to reflect the crisis, which the administration has been warning about for months.
He's also been doing run-throughs of his remarks, according to the White House.
He will do so ahead of the release of the new strategy document that White House officials have been working on for weeks.
said Dr. Celine Gounder, one of the experts the White House consulted.
Yet it is the heavy dose of foreign policy that will separate this year's State of the Union from its predecessors.
