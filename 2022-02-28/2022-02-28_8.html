     Deadline Day Arrives as M.L.B. and Players Continue Negotiations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     JUPITER, Fla. — On Monday, minutes before 10 a.m., members of the negotiating team from the Major League Baseball players’ union made their daily walk from the parking lot of Roger Dean Stadium into their meeting room.
Among the group: the veteran pitchers Andrew Miller and Max Scherzer, both top union representatives.
But after making little progress toward a new labor deal with the union last week, the league doubled down on its position with a threat.
M.L.B., which locked out the players on Dec. 2, told the union on Wednesday that it was serious about its self-imposed deadline, Monday, for reaching a new collective bargaining agreement in order to begin the 162-game season as scheduled.
If that deadline was not met, the league said, it would begin canceling games, not pay players for those missed games and not reschedule them.

     After a weekend of negotiations that reportedly saw progress toward a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between MLB and MLB players, there’s hope that further negotiations today and tonight will yield a deal.

If a deal cannot be reached soon, we could see the beginning of the regular season, now set for March 31, delayed.

     The MLB-imposed deadline to end the MLB-imposed lockout is here
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Today is the day in which Major League Baseball has dictated that an agreement needs to be reached in order for the season to start on time.
You know, to end a lockout that they instigated, followed by weeks of no attempts to negotiate from them, followed by an absolute unwillingness to actively negotiate with the MLBPA.
There’s only one side actually trying to start the season on time and it isn’t the owners.
How many days has it been since the owners locked out the players?
90 days, and it looks like we might as well start hunkering down for another 90 days.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Those talks reached a critical point Monday, the day MLB set as the cutoff to reach an agreement or else Opening Day would be postponed.
The union also began to organize a staffed training facility in Arizona, according to a person familiar with the plan, preparing in case the lockout continues.
In other words, even if MLB postpones Opening Day, the union was holding out hope that the schedule could be restored down the road.
They could lift the lockout at any time, but nothing in the history of baseball labor negotiations suggests that would be under consideration.
Lifting the lockout would give the players the ability to strike, which would take some leverage from the owners.

     It was the eighth straight day of talks at the vacant spring training home of the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals.
Monday was picked as a deadline because Manfred says at least 28 days of training are needed before the season starts.
The union has not said whether it agrees, and baseball has shortened spring training to as few as three weeks in the past.
Spring training games were to have begun Saturday and already have been canceled through March 7.
Players and teams entered deadline day far apart on many key issues and unresolved on others.

     MLB lockout: what we know -- a timeline

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Major League Baseball (MLB) is in the midst of its first work stoppage since the 1994-1995 season.
Owners and players are currently negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) -- without a new deal, there will be no baseball.
The CBA determines players' terms and conditions of employment.
Here is a timeline of what we know about the lockout:December 2, 2021: With no CBA between MLB and the MLB Players Association in place, the league implements a lockout.
The lockout stops all business including no trades and free-agent signings.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Most knew that Monday represented a decisive day in the negotiations between MLB owners and the MLB Players Association taking place thousands of miles away in Jupiter, Florida.
But MLB players, including several Mariners, increased their criticism of the situation on social media.
Several MLB players have already been in Arizona working out privately.
If and when an agreement is reached, how long will they have for a spring training.
The three-week spring training going into the COVID-shortened 2020 season proved to be less than ideal and was the blame for several injuries.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The sides met nearly a dozen times Monday, and negotiations carried on past midnight as the lockout reached its 90th day.
Commissioner Rob Manfred met with the union twice — once more than he had previously since the lockout started Dec. 2.
“We’re working at it,’” Manfred said around 6 p.m. after his second session of the day with the union.
Not since Aug 30, 2002, has MLB come this close to losing regular-season games to labor strife.
The union proposed the pre-arbitration pool have $115 million distributed to 150 players, and management wants $20 million to be split among 30.

     There was no immediate threat for lost games with the scheduled start to spring training months away.
MLB could lift the lockout at any time and continue labor negotiations with the union.
The spring training exhibition slate has already been delayed until at least March 8.
Earlier this month, MLB first announced the first week of spring training games were postponed amid the ongoing lockout.
MLB previously set Feb. 28 as a deadline for an agreement merely for the regular season to start on time.

     Monday marked the league's self-imposed deadline for when a new collective bargaining agreement must be reached before regular-season games are canceled.
This would mark the first time in 27 years that regular-season contests are impacted by a work stoppage.
As the clock struck midnight in Jupiter, Florida (where negotiations are happening) the MLBPA and MLB continued to talk.
The two sides could continue negotiations on Tuesday and avoid pushing Opening Day back despite the league's deadline, adds ESPN's Jeff Passan.
