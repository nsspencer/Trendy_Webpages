     White House officials and their allies on Capitol Hill fear they could lose control of both chambers if Mr. Biden is unable to turn those numbers around.
Officials said Mr. Biden will also announce new steps to confront price increases caused by a lack of competition.
Those companies have significantly increased their shipping rates through the pandemic, the White House said on Monday.
The Justice Department and the Federal Maritime Commission together will crack down on antitrust violations among shipping companies, to try to bring more competition into the sector.
Federal shipping regulators will also step up their oversight of certain practices by shipping companies, like unfair fees.

     They have argued viciously in Congress over just about everything: Whether the Capitol insurrection should be investigated or brushed aside.
Email newsletter signup“I think you will see in the State of the Union, a strong bipartisan support for our president,” predicts Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a Biden ally.
It can’t be said that Republicans are fully pleased with Biden’s handling of the Ukraine war.
McConnell has been highly critical of the president’s runup to the crisis, calling the White House’s disastrous exit from Afghanistan last summer a sign of U.S. weakness that opened the door to Putin’s invasion.
Leading Republican lawmakers have derided what defense hawks view as Biden’s initial reluctance to impose sanctions to deter Putin’s advance on Ukraine.

     The White House will stream it live on its website, as will news networks through Facebook.
Going back to Lyndon B. Johnson, the average length of presidents’ State of the Union remarks is roughly 50 minutes.
Biden’s immediate predecessor, Donald Trump, delivered three State of the Union addresses, all surpassing one hour in length.
Trump’s 2019 speech lasted 1 hour and 22 minutes, the third-longest State of the Union address ever.
Bill Clinton holds the record for the longest State of the Union speech, lasting 1 hour and 29 minutes, according to the American Presidency Project.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden sat through many State of the Union speeches as a senator and vice president.
The White House plans to stream it at WH.gov/live, as well as on its YouTube, Facebook and Twitter pages.
An estimated 26.9 million people across 16 television networks watched his address to a joint session of Congress last year, which was not a State of the Union speech.
Biden was a U.S. senator for 36 years and sat in the audience for many State of the Union addresses.
After becoming president in 2009, Biden sat at the rostrum, with the House speaker, for President Barack Obama's State of the Union addresses.
