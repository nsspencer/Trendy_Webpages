     Deadline Day Arrives as M.L.B. and Players Continue Negotiations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     JUPITER, Fla. — On Monday, minutes before 10 a.m., members of the negotiating team from the Major League Baseball players’ union made their daily walk from the parking lot of Roger Dean Stadium into their meeting room.
Among the group: the veteran pitchers Andrew Miller and Max Scherzer, both top union representatives.
But after making little progress toward a new labor deal with the union last week, the league doubled down on its position with a threat.
M.L.B., which locked out the players on Dec. 2, told the union on Wednesday that it was serious about its self-imposed deadline, Monday, for reaching a new collective bargaining agreement in order to begin the 162-game season as scheduled.
If that deadline was not met, the league said, it would begin canceling games, not pay players for those missed games and not reschedule them.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After a weekend of negotiations that reportedly saw progress toward a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between MLB and MLB players, there’s hope that further negotiations today and tonight will yield a deal.
), a deal reached tomorrow or Wednesday may not impact an immediate launch to training before a March 8 start to games in what would be a slightly shortened spring training.
If a deal cannot be reached soon, we could see the beginning of the regular season, now set for March 31, delayed.

     The MLB-imposed deadline to end the MLB-imposed lockout is here
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Today is the day in which Major League Baseball has dictated that an agreement needs to be reached in order for the season to start on time.
You know, to end a lockout that they instigated, followed by weeks of no attempts to negotiate from them, followed by an absolute unwillingness to actively negotiate with the MLBPA.
There’s only one side actually trying to start the season on time and it isn’t the owners.
How many days has it been since the owners locked out the players?
90 days, and it looks like we might as well start hunkering down for another 90 days.

     MLB: It’s deadline day to save opening day, 162-game season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It was the eighth straight day of talks at the vacant spring training home of the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals.
Monday was picked as a deadline because Manfred says at least 28 days of training are needed before the season starts.
The union has not said whether it agrees, and baseball has shortened spring training to as few as three weeks in the past.
Spring training games were to have begun Saturday and already have been canceled through March 7.
Players and teams entered deadline day far apart on many key issues and unresolved on others.

     Uneasy feelings persist as MLB negotiations continue on decisive day of labor impasse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Most knew that Monday represented a decisive day in the negotiations between MLB owners and the MLB Players Association taking place thousands of miles away in Jupiter, Florida.
But MLB players, including several Mariners, increased their criticism of the situation on social media.
Several MLB players have already been in Arizona working out privately.
If and when an agreement is reached, how long will they have for a spring training.
The three-week spring training going into the COVID-shortened 2020 season proved to be less than ideal and was the blame for several injuries.

     MLB pushes labor-deal deadline to Tuesday for March 31 start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     JUPITER, Fla. (AP) — Major League Baseball extended its deadline for reaching a labor deal to Tuesday at 5 p.m. for salvaging opening day as scheduled on March 31.
Commissioner Rob Manfred met with the union twice — once more than he had previously since the lockout started Dec. 2.
“We’re working at it,” Manfred said around 6 p.m. after his second session of the day with the union.
MLB has offered to raise the luxury tax threshold from $210 million last season to $220 million this year.
The union proposed the pre-arbitration pool have $115 million distributed to 150 players, and management wants $25 million to be split among 30.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The luxury tax, minimum salary, pre-arbitration bonus pool, and expanded playoffs were all on the table in the 11th-hour back-and-forth.
Talks are expected to continue Tuesday, with MLB extending its self-imposed deadline to 5 p.m.
The players were also vowing to veto expanding the playoffs, the owners’ greatest desire in a new agreement.
But MLB waited 43 days before re-engaging the players in talks on core economics.
“Somehow, during those four negotiations, players and union representatives figured out a way to trust me enough to make a deal.”That streak was being tested early Tuesday morning.

     As @EvanDrellich said, MLB suggested in the first meeting with the MLBPA today that the league is willing to cancel a month's worth of games.
Player pay has been in decline for four straight seasons, which is a choice made by the owners.
Negotiations in anticipation of December’s CBA expiration were virtually nonexistent, which is a choice made by the owners.
