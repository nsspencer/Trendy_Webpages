     Fez pleads with Ashtray to let him take the fall, because they know the police are literally on their way.
The FBI enter the home and there's a shootout between the FBI officers and Ashtray, who's hiding in the bathtub.
For a second, the shooting stops, and it seems like Ashtray was shot.
An FBI officer approaches the bathroom door, opens it, and Ashtray is laying on the ground, as if he's dead.
He went on to talk about what he thinks could happen in season 3, if Ashtray somehow survived.

Fez also looks heartbroken and dazed as he's carted away by the police, implying that he saw his brother shot to death.
