     LOCAL SCHOOLS REACT TO NEW CDC RULES FOR FACE MASKS ON BUSES
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Local schools are reacting to the new directives from the CDC concerning face masks on school buses and vans.
The mask mandate had been in place since schools started to reopen during the pandemic, and was in line with a mandate that extended to all public transportation.
The CDC says that guidance had been updated that no longer recommends universal masking in K-12 schools and early education settings.
The decision on whether or not to mask on school buses or vans is now up to the individual districts.
It’s not known at this time if the rest of the school districts in Indiana County are doing the same.

     NORRISTOWN — The Montgomery County Office of Public Health announced Monday it will update its school and public masking recommendations to align with new CDC guidance for COVID-19 given the county’s high vaccination rates.
Updated guidance documents will be released later this week.
The CDC’s updated framework shifts from four levels of community transmission to three: low, medium, or high.
The Montgomery County Office of Public Health continues to operate four sites that offer the vaccine at no charge.
All eligible Montgomery County residents are urged to get a booster dose as soon as they are eligible.

     Greenwich schools greenlights mask-optional policy for buses under new CDC guidance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Initially, the mask-optional policy did not apply to school buses because of directives from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But on Friday, the CDC updated its policy and now is allowing school districts to forego a mask requirement on buses.
It saw a large surge in COVID-19 cases after the holiday recess in December, with 740 cases reported in the first week of January, according to the tracker.
That is triple the 700 total cases reported in the 2020-21 school year.
The totals were much smaller in the first four months of the year in the Greenwich schools, with 392 cases of COVID-19 reported in December, 65 cases reported in November, 29 cases reported in October and 58 reported cases in September.

     The CDC issues new masking guidance as U.S. COVID cases dropThe CDC's new guidance means most of the U.S. population is considered to be at low or medium risk for COVID-19, and the agency has given the green light to take masks off.
The CDC also dropped its recommendation for universal masking in schools, leaving it up to local officials to decide.
Allison, as COVID cases have continue to drop, many states and cities have already dropped masking requirements.
Instead of focusing so much on COVID cases, now the focus is on preventing serious disease.
His message is that though mask guidance is changing, what's not changing is the evidence that high-quality masks in settings of high transmission are beneficial.

Vaugh and her son’s speech language pathologist, Tamra Mullen, are worried after seeing that the new guidelines list fewer milestones.
She said a two-year-old should be able to say 50 words but now the milestone is for a 2-and-a-half-year-old.
She wants parents to be aware of the changes and recommends going to a professional if you feel your child is falling behind.

White women saw the smallest drop -- of less than 1%, from about 916,000 births to 914,000 -- and Asian women saw the biggest drop -- of 8%, from approximately 110,000 births to 102,000.
