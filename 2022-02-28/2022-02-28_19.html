     Jackie Robinson, Michael Jordan again take centerstage, but this time at record-setting auction for ‘debut’ tickets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Yes, Jackie Robinson and Michael Jordan still have the ability to make headlines, but it has nothing to do with stealing home or hitting a game-winning shot.
Robinson, of course, made his MLB debut in 1947 while Jordan played his first NBA game in 1984.
The Jordan ticket sold for $468,000, which was $204,000 more than a ticket stub from the same game sold for in December.
The Robinson ticket stub, meanwhile, then broke a record for the second time Sunday when it sold for a whopping $480,000.
Robinson made his MLB debut on April 15, 1947 while Jordan first stepped on NBA hardwood on Oct. 26, 1984.

     Tickets From the Careers of Michael Jordan and Jackie Robinson Just Broke Auction Records
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But there’s also a perennial interest in tickets tied to landmark moments in the careers of various athletes.
On Sunday, USA Today reports, tickets from the debuts of Jackie Robinson and Michael Jordan sold at record prices.
A ticket stub from the 1947 game in which Robinson made his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers sold for $480,000.
That set a new record — and it did so by eclipsing a sale made earlier during the same auction.
The previous record holder was a ticket from Michael Jordan’s 1984 debut with the Chicago Bulls, which sold for $468,000.

     A ticket stub from Jackie Robinson's majors debut sells for a record-breaking $480K
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A ticket stub from Jackie Robinson's major-league debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 is believed to be the most expensive sporting-event ticket ever sold at auction.
Costing just $1.75 at the time, the ticket stub went for a whopping $480,000 on Sunday, according to Heritage Auctions.
Earlier in the auction, a bidder bought a full ticket from Michael Jordan's 1984 NBA debut with the Chicago Bulls for $468,000, ESPN reported.
The previous record was $264,000 for a ticket stub — not a full ticket — from the same game, according to the network.
The Jackie Robinson ticket stub was one of just seven known to be in existence, the auction house said.

     A True Trailblazer: The Story of Jackie Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This series started with Minnie Miñoso and continues with one of the greatest trailblazers in sports history, Jackie Robinson.
Martin Luther King Jr. was quoted saying “Jackie Robinson made my success possible.
By 1970, he founded the Jackie Robinson Construction Company, which sought to provide housing for low-income people.
In 1973, with the assistance of Martin L. Edelman, Charles Williams, and Franklin H. Williams, Jackie’s wife Robin Robinson honored his memory by establishing The Jackie Robinson Foundation (JRF).
In 2007, MLB started celebrating Jackie Robinson Day, as mentioned above.

     Ticket from Jackie Robinson’s pro debut, jersey from Mickey Mantle’s final game set records at auctions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The jersey worn by Mickey Mantle when he played his final game as a New York Yankee on Sept. 28, 1968, sold for $2,190,000.
That’s the highest price ever paid at auction for a Mantle jersey, shattering the previous record of $1,320,000 set at Heritage Auctions in August 2018.
The only known full ticket from Michael Jordan’s NBA debut in October 1984 sold during the same session for $468,000.
Like the Robinson stub, the Jordan ticket shattered the previous record for a sports ticket set in December, when a stub from MJ’s first game as a Chicago Bull sold for $264,000.
But in the final hours of the auction, Robinson eventually slid into home with the new record.
