     Art Briles Resigns From Grambling State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Art Briles, the former Baylor football coach who was hired last week as Grambling State University’s offensive coordinator, has resigned four days after being hired.
The news was first reported by ESPN and confirmed by the school.
Baylor fired Briles in 2016 after an investigation found that he and other coaches on his staff failed to report sexual assault accusations made against their players.
Briles released a statement on Monday in which he thanked Grambling State for the opportunity to join its staff.
“I feel that my continued presence will be a distraction to you and your team,” Briles said, “which is the last thing that I want.”

     Art Briles tells Grambling State he won't be Tigers' offensive coordinator
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Art Briles informed Grambling State University on Monday that he'll no longer be the school's offensive coordinator, saying in a statement obtained by ESPN that he did not want to be a "distraction" to the football team.
Briles' decision comes after the hire by first-year coach Hue Jackson was met with a wave of backlash.
Briles' hiring on Thursday was met with sharp criticism, including from former Grambling State star and coach Doug Williams, who told ESPN's John Keim that he "can't support it" and that late Grambling State coach "[Eddie] Robinson is turning over right now."
The team pulled its offer to Briles on the same day it was extended because of the amount of backlash.
Since going 65-37 over eight years at Baylor, Briles has coached two seasons at a Texas high school and another in Italy.

     Art Briles out as Grambling State offensive coordinator after backlash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Controversial football coach Art Briles is out as Grambling State’s offensive coordinator just four days after being hired, according reports on Monday.
The hiring came under immediate scrutiny, including from former Washington Commanders quarterback and Grambling icon Doug Williams.
He said he was “out” as far as his dealing with the program should Briles be the team’s offensive coordinator.
I’m very disappointed in Grambling, I really am,” Williams told the Washington Post.
Apparently, it wasn’t good enough — it wasn’t good enough,” Briles said.

     Grambling confirmed Thursday that Briles had agreed to join head coach Hue Jackson’s staff, although according to the Monroe (La.)
Furthermore, as a campus leader, the head coach is held to an even higher standard.
A former head coach of the Oakland Raiders and Cleveland Browns, Jackson was hired by Grambling in December.
While with the Browns in 2016, Jackson brought in Briles as a guest to assist with Cleveland’s offense.
“I’ve gotten to know Coach Briles, and he’s a tremendous offensive-minded football coach,” Jackson said then.

     Four days after announcing Art Briles as Grambling State's new offensive coordinator, the embattled former football coach at Baylor resigned.
Briles was confirmed as the offensive coordinator on Thursday by Grambling officials.
Jackson will have to search for his third offensive coordinator since he was hired.
Mimi Methvin, who served on the UL System Board from 2019 until resigning Feb. 2, called Briles' hiring "concerning" Friday.
Briles' history at Baylor resurfaced again in 2019 after he was targeted for Southern Miss' offensive coordinator position.

     — Art Briles should just quit trying to get a coaching job that anybody has to know about.
“Thanks for giving me the opportunity to be part of your coaching staff at Grambling State University,” Briles said in the statement.
Raymond Carlin III / USA TODAY SportsGrambling and coach Hue Jackson received major backlash for hiring the former Baylor coach, who hasn’t coached college football since 2016.
On Friday, Jackson released a public letter defending his decision to hire Briles, pledging to “support Coach Briles and all victims of assault, violence, social and racial injustices.”Three days later, Briles is out of the job.
Reinhold Matay / USA TODAY Sports Kevin Jairaj / USA TODAY SportsThe same happened when he was hired by a Canadian football team and quickly dismissed.

     Art Briles has resigned from his role as offensive coordinator at Grambling State after just four days, the school confirmed on Monday.
Briles was announced as offensive coordinator on Feb. 24 by Grambling State coach Hue Jackson, a decision that immediately drew criticism.
"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be a part of your coaching staff at Grambling State University," Briles said in a statement to Sports Illustrated.
Grambling State released a statement to CBS Sports pointing out that the statement was Jackson's alone and not reflective of the school's perspective.
"The Hue Jackson Foundation is not a part of Grambling State University," the statement read.
