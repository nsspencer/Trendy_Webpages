     Art Briles Resigns From Grambling State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Art Briles, the former Baylor football coach who was hired last week as Grambling State University’s offensive coordinator, has resigned four days after being hired.
The news was first reported by ESPN and confirmed by the school.
Baylor fired Briles in 2016 after an investigation found that he and other coaches on his staff failed to report sexual assault accusations made against their players.
Briles released a statement on Monday in which he thanked Grambling State for the opportunity to join its staff.
“I feel that my continued presence will be a distraction to you and your team,” Briles said, “which is the last thing that I want.”

     Art Briles tells Grambling State he won't be Tigers' offensive coordinator
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Art Briles informed Grambling State University on Monday that he'll no longer be the school's offensive coordinator, saying in a statement obtained by ESPN that he did not want to be a "distraction" to the football team.
Briles' decision comes after the hire by first-year coach Hue Jackson was met with a wave of backlash.
Briles' hiring on Thursday was met with sharp criticism, including from former Grambling State star and coach Doug Williams, who told ESPN's John Keim that he "can't support it" and that late Grambling State coach "[Eddie] Robinson is turning over right now."
The team pulled its offer to Briles on the same day it was extended because of the amount of backlash.
Since going 65-37 over eight years at Baylor, Briles has coached two seasons at a Texas high school and another in Italy.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Four days after announcing Art Briles as Grambling State's new offensive coordinator, the embattled former football coach at Baylor resigned.
Briles was confirmed as the offensive coordinator on Thursday by Grambling officials.
Jackson will have to search for his third offensive coordinator since he was hired.
Mimi Methvin, who served on the UL System Board from 2019 until resigning Feb. 2, called Briles' hiring "concerning" Friday.
Briles' history at Baylor resurfaced again in 2019 after he was targeted for Southern Miss' offensive coordinator position.

     Controversial football coach Art Briles is out as Grambling State’s offensive coordinator just four days after being hired, according reports on Monday.
The hiring came under immediate scrutiny, including from former Washington Commanders quarterback and Grambling icon Doug Williams.
He said he was “out” as far as his dealing with the program should Briles be the team’s offensive coordinator.
I’m very disappointed in Grambling, I really am,” Williams told the Washington Post.
Apparently, it wasn’t good enough — it wasn’t good enough,” Briles said.

Grambling State's hiring of former Baylor coach Art Briles drew immediate blowback from the college football world.
Briles was fired from Baylor in 2016 after an an independent investigation revealed Briles and administrators at the university ignored dozens of sexual assault allegations.
The Hue Jackson Foundation reportedly collected $158,000 in 2019, and it then spent $115,000 to its sole paid employee and spent another $15,000 on travel, per ESPN’s Dan Murphy.

“I’ve gotten to know Coach Briles, and he’s a tremendous offensive-minded football coach,” Jackson said then.

     Art Briles hired by Grambling State: Former Baylor coach to serve as offensive coordinator for Tigers program
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Grambling State has hired the former Baylor coach as its new offensive coordinator, a university spokesman confirmed to 247Sports' Chris Hummer.
Briles was the head coach for the Bears from 2008-15, where he posted a 65-37 record with four top-15 finishes and two New Year's Six/BCS bowl berths.
Grambling coach Hue Jackson released a statement on Friday, through his Hue Jackson Foundation, defending his choice to bring Briles on board.
"We have a clear understanding of the role that coaches and others who have a position of trust play in the loves of those they meet," Jackson wrote.
"The Hue Jackson Foundation is not a part of Grambling State University," the statement read.
