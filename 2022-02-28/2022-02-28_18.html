     Vanessa Hudgens Wore the Trendiest Liquid Bob to the SAG Awards — See Photos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Vanessa Hudgens's liquid bob hairstyle at the 2022 SAG Awards was easily one of our favorite looks of the night.
She started by sectioning the shorter top section of Hudgens's hair up and into a bun.
Instagram/@daniellepriano Instagram/@danielleprianoNext, Danielle clipped hair extensions from Glam Seamless over the top before hiding the seam with Hudgens's natural hair on top.
Everything was combed neatly together to blend the extensions with Hudgens's real hair, and Priano straightened everything into a silky-straight bob.
To give the look the trademark liquid shine that's set to be stratospheric for 2022, she spritzed the Sexy Hair Smooth &amp; Seal Shine &amp; Anti Frizz Spray through Hudgens's hair to leave it looking extra glossy before setting everything in place with the Sexy Hair hairspray.

     Naked dresses are perhaps the most impressive of all red carpet feats.
While they may not always make the best-dressed list, they do require a certain breed of celebrity to pull off.
The girl rocked a completely sheer dress without a bra — and later remarked that her only regret was not wearing a bedazzled thong to match.
Then, there was the year 2015, when the Met Gala saw not one nor two but three naked dresses on the red carpet, all worn by Hollywood’s hottest A-listers.

     Cole Tucker spotted with Pirates super fan Michael Keaton at SAG Awards
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With baseball’s ongoing labor dispute, Pirates shortstop/outfielder Cole Tucker joined his girlfriend Vanessa Hudgens at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday night in Santa Monica, California.
While schmoozing with Hollywood’s brightest stars, Tucker ran into a huge Pirates fan, Pittsburgh’s own Michael Keaton.
Keaton has been spotted at Pirates games throughout the years, even confronting a heckler during a game in Atlanta against the Braves in 2015.
Hopefully soon, Tucker will be in Florida for Spring Training and Keaton along with all of us will be watching Pirates games soon.
Tucker played in 43 games for the Bucs in 2021, batting .222 with 36 hits, two home runs and 12 RBI.
