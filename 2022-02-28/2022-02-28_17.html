     Target adopting minimum wages as high as $24 an hour
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     U.S. retailer Target has announced it will adopt a minimum wage system that will pay company employees up to $24 an hour.
In a statement on Monday, the Minneapolis-based retailer said that the new minimum wage will range from $15 to $24, depending on the job and local market.
Some of Target’s rivals, including Best Buy, have raised their hourly minimum wages for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Costco raised its hourly minimum wage from $16 to $17, and Amazon’s starting wage is $15 an hour, with an average starting wage for transportation and fulfillment jobs of $18 per hour.
Walmart boosted its hourly minimum wage for employees to $12 an hour, raising the hourly wages for more than 565,000 store workers by at least a dollar as well, the AP noted.

     Target boosts its starting pay for some jobs to $24 an hour
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     New York (CNNBusiness) Target announced Monday that it is raising its starting wage for workers in some positions to up to $24.
The Minneapolis-based retailer said the increase will apply to hourly workers at its discount stores, supply chain facilities and headquarters.
Target in 2020 set its minimum wage at $15.
That will remain in place, but Target said some workers will qualify for higher starting pay based on the nature of their job and the prevailing competitive wages in their local market.
That investment also includes expanding access to healthcare benefits for hourly workers, beginning in April.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After increasing its starting wage to $15 for all workers a few years ago, Target now plans to expand the range of its starting wage to up to $24 an hour.
The starting wage at the Minneapolis-based retailer will range from $15-$24 an hour, with the exact starting wage depending on the job and the local market, Target said Monday.
Wages will be set based on "industry benchmarking, local wage data and more" but Target did not say where exactly the starting wages would be the highest.
Target also plans to expand health care benefits for employees and their families starting in April.
People are also looking for health benefits and other benefits, like hybrid working schedules, and the opportunity to advance their career.

     Retailers’ Wage Increases to Attract Workers Aren’t Yet Denting Profits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Large retailers and other employers that hire hourly workers are continuing to lift wages, and so far have kept profits growing as well.
In August, 4.3 million workers quit their jobs, part of what many are calling “the Great Resignation.” Here’s a look into where the workers are going and why.
Photo illustration: Liz Ornitz/WSJCostco Wholesale Corp. plans to raise its starting hourly wage for store workers to $17.50 in March.
Walmart Inc., the country’s largest retailer by revenue, said last September it would raise workers’ pay to at least $12 per hour.
Employers in the service industry and smaller retailers that hire hourly workers are also increasing pay.
