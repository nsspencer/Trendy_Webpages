     Montco officials update masking guidance to align with CDC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NORRISTOWN — The Montgomery County Office of Public Health announced Monday it will update its school and public masking recommendations to align with new CDC guidance for COVID-19 given the county’s high vaccination rates.
Updated guidance documents will be released later this week.
The CDC’s updated framework shifts from four levels of community transmission to three: low, medium, or high.
The Montgomery County Office of Public Health continues to operate four sites that offer the vaccine at no charge.
All eligible Montgomery County residents are urged to get a booster dose as soon as they are eligible.

     Experts concerned after CDC changes developmental milestone for kids
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     However, some experts are raising concerns as the new guidelines pushed back some benchmarks.
Vaugh and her son’s speech language pathologist, Tamra Mullen, are worried after seeing that the new guidelines list fewer milestones.
She said a two-year-old should be able to say 50 words but now the milestone is for a 2-and-a-half-year-old.
She wants parents to be aware of the changes and recommends going to a professional if you feel your child is falling behind.
ASHA said it’s concerned about the inconsistencies and wants the agency to listen to speech language experts when making changes.

Wear a mask or respirator that provides them with greater protection when the Covid-19 community level is high.
The CDC’s recommendations are only that, but it has maintained its order that travelers wear masks while using public transportation and indoor transportation hubs.

     The CDC issues new masking guidance as U.S. COVID cases dropThe CDC's new guidance means most of the U.S. population is considered to be at low or medium risk for COVID-19, and the agency has given the green light to take masks off.
The CDC also dropped its recommendation for universal masking in schools, leaving it up to local officials to decide.
Allison, as COVID cases have continue to drop, many states and cities have already dropped masking requirements.
Instead of focusing so much on COVID cases, now the focus is on preventing serious disease.
His message is that though mask guidance is changing, what's not changing is the evidence that high-quality masks in settings of high transmission are beneficial.
