     Putin deploys 400 mercenaries to hunt down, assassinate Zelensky
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Kremlin has reportedly sent more than 400 paid mercenaries into Kyiv with the mission to assassinate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
According to The Times of London, the Wagner Group, a Russian private military organization accused of operating covertly with the Russian government, flew in mercenaries from Africa to Kyiv around five weeks ago.
According to the newspaper, their mission was to decapitate Zelenskyy's government and lay the groundwork for Moscow to seize power in exchange for large financial rewards.
Ukrainian authorities first learned of the Russian mercenaries on Saturday, according to The Times.
A curfew was imposed in Kyiv hours later, from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m., for at least the next 36 hours, "for more effective defense of the capital and the protection of its citizens."

Since its inception in 2014, the Wagner Group has been considered a proxy group of the Russian state abroad, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
It was founded by Dmitry Utkiny, a veteran of both Chechen wars and a former member of the Main Intelligence Directorate, or the Russian intelligence agency abbreviated as GRU.
He and other Wagner Group operatives participated in the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

     Guns for hire: How shadowy Wagner mercenaries support Russian soldiers in Ukraine conflict
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Onboard the secretive military aircraft from Libya were hundreds of hardened mercenaries of the Wagner Group, the shadowy umbrella of private military contractor firms linked to Vladimir Putin’s ally Yevgeny Prigozhin.
In 2014 in Ukraine, Wagner fighters battled side by side with Russian regular forces as well as pro-Kremlin militias, often serving as praetorian guards to maintain order among frequently intoxicated and undisciplined forces.
Since then, the Wagner mercenaries have been deployed as guns for hire in the Middle East, Africa and even Latin America.
Last year, a Syrian filed a case in a Russian court against Wagner fighters who allegedly tortured and beheaded his brother whilst securing a gas plant in 2017.
Gruesome footage of the killing, apparently taken as a souvenir by one of the Wagner fighters, had emerged.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But what is the Wagner Group, who leads them, and who do they take their orders from?
The Wagner Group is mostly comprised of retired regular Russian servicemen, typically aged between 35 and 55.
A former GRU special forces officer, Dmitry Valerievich Utkin is considered to be the founder of the Wagner Group, and his own call-sign is reportedly ‘Wagner’.
With the Wagner Group, he has been seen both in Crimea and Donbas, where the Wagner Group were known to be fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists.
As well as President Zelensky, the Wagner Group is also reportedly targeting prominent Ukrainians such as the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir, both former boxing champions.

     Putin's militia with orders to kill Zelensky: Blood-thirsty mercenaries The Wagner Group revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AdvertisementThe 400-strong squad of bloodthirsty mercenaries flown in from Africa with orders to kill Volodymyr Zelensky are part of a notorious private militia linked to a string of rapes, robberies, murders, and alleged war crimes.
Sending the Wagner Group into Ukraine would fit in with its use by the Russian state elsewhere in the world.
Putin himself has been pictured at a Kremlin function with Wagner troops including lieutenant colonel Dmitry Utkin, the group's suspected founder.
The Times reported that between 2,000 and 4,000 Wagner Group mercenaries arrived in Ukraine back in January, but with different missions.
Sources said the militia were briefed about Putin's plans against Ukraine back in December, long before the Russian army was told.
