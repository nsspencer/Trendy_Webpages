     Cardinals QB Kyler Murray's agent releases statement outlining desire for contract extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This is the latest in an offseason saga with Murray and the Cardinals that's largely played out on social media and media reports.
The statement is a curious look after the 24-year-old Murray posted on social media Feb. 14 that "all of this nonsense is not what I'm about."
Prior to that statement, it was reported by Garafolo that the Cardinals were hoping for Murray to make progress with his maturity and leadership.
The report followed Murray scrubbing his Instagram account of any and all Cardinals references after he played in the Pro Bowl on Feb. 6.
The team followed that up with its own social media scrub.

     Kyler Murray 'absolutely' wants to be Arizona Cardinals' long-term QB, sent contract proposal to team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Murray's agent, Erik Burkhardt, said in a statement Monday that the quarterback has sent a detailed contract proposal to the Cardinals.
The statement noted that in order to consistently compete for championships, the franchise needs long-term stability, which Murray is offering.
After weeks of drama, the statement made two things clear: Murray is committed to remaining with the Cardinals long term, and he "desperately wants to win the Super Bowl."
After that game, Murray said he believed that last season, which Arizona started 7-0 and finished 11-6, could be considered a "massive failure."
The salary cap is one big pie, and you're making room for a new piece of the pie that's going to replace the rookie contract.

     Kyler Murray and Arizona in offseason talksCardinals, Murray continue offseason squabbleby Associated PressTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — For the Arizona Cardinals, one of the perks of Kyler Murray’s three years as the team’s franchise quarterback is an absence of off-the-field distractions or drama.
Allen, though, has led Buffalo to some postseason victories, while Murray has not won a playoff game with Arizona.
Now it’s up to the Cardinals to decide if Murray is worth that kind of cash.
A few weeks later, Murray scrubbed his social media accounts of all references to the Cardinals, prompting speculation he was unhappy.
On a Phoenix radio show last week, Bidwill tried to clear the air and said he’s had “good conversations” with Murray.

     Kyler Murray pushes back on trade rumors, but has contract demands for Cardinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     One of the most surprising and bizarre storylines this offseason is the status of Cardinals QB Kyler Murray.
We’ll paraphrase the important parts here:He wants to be the QB of the Cardinals — but he also wants to win a Super Bowl.
Murray wants to see the Cardinals commit to building a winning team.
Murray is willing to lower his cap figure for the upcoming season, but he wants it to come with future earning protections (aka salary guarantees).
Murray asserts that he wants to see action, not talk from the Cardinals.

     Kyler Murray says he's committed to Cardinals, but needs a new contract first
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Friday, Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill said he in the category of those who love Kyler Murray.
Monday morning, the quarterback's agent, Erik Burkhardt, released a statement that Murray is all-in with the Arizona Cardinals – but also makes clear Murray is seeking a contract extension.
"Kyler wants to be direct with loyal Arizona Cardinals fans and the great community of the Valley in stating his two very important goals and objectives," the lengthy statement begins.
Murray became eligible for a contract extension after the regular season ended.
The Cardinals also have pending free agents -- and other team's free-agents-to-be -- that are priorities right now.

     MAQB: Why Kyler Murray’s Contract Is Suddenly an Issue
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Of course, this is something that probably should’ve been addressed a long time ago with teams, players and agents.
That's a process I put into practice in Philadelphia, football players come from every walk of life.
• Someone has to explain to me like I’m 5 how supply-chain issues are preventing an NFL team for wearing throwback jersey in the fall.
But as far as outfitting a football team … I’m not sure how it is that Nike can’t make that work.
And, to me, that they’ll be in Germany is especially significant, given that kids there are actually playing the game.
