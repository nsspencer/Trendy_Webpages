     Lakers: This Vegas Bet Placed Before the Season is About to Pay Off in the Worst Way For LA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Before this season started, NBA analysts and experts had their doubts about the Lakers.
And while that is very terrible for the Lakers and their fans, one Vegas bettor could reap the rewards.
Per SportsLine, someone placed a $10,000 bet with MGM before the season started that Los Angeles would not make the playoffs.
And right now, Los Angeles is 27-33 and sitting in the 9th seed in the Western Conference.
It's bad out in Los Angeles.

     Lakers Game for the Birds Against Pelicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Lakers hosted the New Orleans Pelicans for the last Sunday in February.
It was a difficult game; Los Angeles allowed the Pelicans to pick up the 123-95 win.
Their shortcomings were likely a result of Los Angeles‚Äô lack of control.
Nola was also extremely effective with their fast break, they more than doubled the Lakers‚Äô points in transition.
As the team looks towards March, the Lakers will return for a home game against the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday.

Sunday night, the Pelicans scored 25 points off 23 Lakers turnovers, seven of them Russell Westbrook‚Äôs, seven of them LeBron‚Äôs.

As LeBron James talked to the media after the game, the flag on the microphone he was holding slid down and hit his hand.
In the eyes of Lakers coach Frank Vogel, there is only one thing for the Lakers to do after losing so badly to the Pelicans.

Midway through the third quarter with the Lakers trailing by 19 points, James tried a baseline bounce pass that did not come close.
As James headed to the other end of the court, fans at Crypto.com Arena even booed the team and its superstar.
I ain‚Äôt worried about that, doesn‚Äôt bother me, that‚Äôs the part and I‚Äôm not really worried about it at all.
LeBron James said he's determined to improve down the road, pointing out that making seven turnovers is not exactly the recipe for success.

     If they slip out of the play-in round, the Pelicans are almost certain to keep that pick.

If you're pretty confident in that, you should probably assume that the Lakers hold their spot in the top 10.
If he needs to score 40 three times in two weeks to get the Lakers into the play-in round, he can probably do it.
No team in the play-in hunt is more reliant on one player than the Lakers are on James.
