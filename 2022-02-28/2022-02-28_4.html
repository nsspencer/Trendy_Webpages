     'The Batman' flies high with its dark and serious Dark Knight, but hangs around too long
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) "The Batman" presents a muscular vision of the Dark Knight that hardcore fans have long desired, a dark and serious epic that's somewhat offset by two disclaimers: At nearly three hours, the movie hangs around too long, really feeling it down the stretch; and despite its origins, this detective-driven take owes more to movies like "Seven" and "L.A.
Batman again operates in a corrupt, muddy-toned Gotham whose ornate trappings are part New York, part "Blade Runner," and when pressed into action, his fights are bruising, not balletic.
The look might be stylized, but director/co-writer Matt Reeves has steeped Wayne's tragic history in gritty realism, even more so than Christopher Nolan's trilogy starring Christian Bale.
While running through the cast, there's also plenty to praise in Zoë Kravitz's Catwoman (a name never uttered, despite her fondness for felines), Jeffrey Wright's James Gordon and Paul Dano's Riddler.
Lurking in shadows, the Riddler engages them in a game of cat and mouse, sprinkling clues and taunting Batman, who has sought to strike fear into criminals' hearts, rumbling when one asks who he is, "I'm vengeance."

     ‘The Batman’ and Matt Reeves: Emerging From the Shadow of Other Caped Crusaders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Reeves was deep into postproduction on “War” when Warner Bros. approached him about directing Affleck’s Batman movie.
After reviewing that script, Reeves called it “a totally valid and cool take” on the character, “an action set-piece adventure” that he likened to a James Bond movie for the studio’s extended universe of DC superheroes.
“I just didn’t know how I would direct that,” Reeves said.
Despite the studio’s interest, he said, “I don’t think you’re going to want me because I wouldn’t do this.
And then they asked me what I would do.”This wasn’t a question Reeves was immediately prepared to answer.

     The Batman movie review &amp; film summary (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This is no flirty, purring Catwoman: She’s a fighter and a survivor with a loyal heart and a strong sense of what’s right.
Following her lead role in Steven Soderbergh’s high-tech thriller “Kimi,” Kravitz continues to reveal a fierce charisma and quiet strength.
Despite the overlong running time of nearly three hours, this is a film that’s consistently viscerally gripping.
His use of shadow and silhouette is masterful, and does so much to convey a sense of foreboding and tension.
This is the most beautiful Batman movie you’ve ever seen—even if it’s not really a Batman movie at all.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Unfortunately, the new Dark Knight doesn’t rise to the occasion.
Gotham is a rotting tinderbox on the brink of utter social collapse as The Batman opens on the city just a couple years into Bruce Wayne’s (Robert Pattinson) career as the Dark Knight.
Inexperienced as this new Batman is, he’s well past his days of merely looming in people’s imaginations as an urban myth.
This is also, one imagines, why there are so many scenes in which Bruce… is not particularly good at being Batman quite yet.
Compared to previous cinematic versions of Batman, this Dark Knight is more of a brawler who makes up for his lack of experience with his ability to take a punch.

     Less an origin story than a coming-of-age tale, The Batman captures the title character only two years into his crimefighting career.
As played by the smoldering English actor Robert Pattinson, Bruce Wayne is both younger and more vulnerable than the bat-dudes we’re accustomed to seeing.
AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementStill, Reeves’ and Pattinson’s vision of the Batman as a Hamlet-like heir unable to move past the primal shock of his parents’ murder has a certain emotional power.
With his black carapace, inexhaustible riches, and impossible-to-defeat technology, Bruce Wayne can be a forbiddingly invulnerable character.
AdvertisementAdvertisementThis is the 12th live-action movie to feature the Batman character since Michael Keaton played him in Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman.

     In back-to-basics 'The Batman,' Robert Pattinson shines in the darknessEnlarge this image toggle caption Jonathan Olley/Warner Bros. Jonathan Olley/Warner Bros.Let's get this out of the way at the top.
Reeves and his co-writer Peter Craig have settled upon a back-to-basics approach to Batman and his world.
Robert Pattinson's Batman puts the emo in emoteBut it's Pattinson who makes the film what it is.
As a result of this expressive vulnerability, Pattinson's Batman is unique in following a clear narrative and emotional arc over the course of the film.
But while Matt Reeves' The Batman was unspooling before me, I didn't check my phone, didn't think about the passing of time.
