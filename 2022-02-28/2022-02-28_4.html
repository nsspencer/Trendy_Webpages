     LeBron James says he had ‘candid conversation’ with reporter he called out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LeBron James said he had a “candid” conversation with The Athletic’s Bill Oram on Sunday night after the Lakers’ 123–95 loss to the Pelicans.
James criticized Oram after a report he wrote that James said was not accurate.
“[Oram] and I had a candid conversation after the game tonight and I know he has a job to do,” James said in the tweet.
After Friday’s loss to the Clippers, James addressed the reported tensions between himself and the Lakers by Oram.
“Bill doesn't like the Lakers anyway, so it's always gonna be a negative any time Bill says anything about the Lakers it's gonna be negative so I hope no one in Lakers faithful listen to Bill Oram,” James said.

     Why LeBron James, Lakers can't tank: Who benefits from Los Angeles' bad season?

     But the Lakers can't afford to write the 2021-22 campaign off as a lost season.
Not only would conceding this season waste an All-NBA campaign from LeBron James, but it would also have no payoff as the Lakers don't own a first-round pick in the 2022 NBA Draft.

     Fast forward to the end of the February and Los Angeles is well off the pace of the league’s top teams and narrowly holding onto a spot in the Western Conference play-in tournament.
Two other notable veterans from the preseason Lakers graphic, Marc Gasol and Rajon Rondo, are no longer on the team.
Los Angeles traded away both and landed little from Memphis and Cleveland in return.

     Lakers fans are not happy about the team’s skid, and on Sunday, they decided to make that known.
During a devastating 123-95 loss to the Pelicans, fans booed the Lakers at Crypto.com Arena.
And video appears to show LeBron James and Trevor Ariza responding to the angry crowd.
It doesn’t bother me none.”Sunday’s loss was the Lakers’ ninth defeat in the past 12 games, dipping their record to 27-33.
DeAndre Jordan threw a wide pass to Wayne Ellington that hit court-side fans in an embarrassing blooper.

     Here’s what LeBron James and other Lakers had to say after 28-point loss to New Orleans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     All the boos the Lakers encountered during their uninspiring 28-point loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday night was just one of many things they had to face.
After he scored 16 points, but had just one assist and seven turnovers, Russell Westbrook was asked if the booing bothered him.
The Lakers committed 23 of them, including seven each by James and Westbrook.
“Obviously seven turnovers is not an ingredient for winning basketball for myself.
In the eyes of Lakers coach Frank Vogel, there is only one thing for the Lakers to do after losing so badly to the Pelicans.

     LeBron James gets booed by Lakers fans, Russell Westbrook says he's not worried
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LeBron James had 32 points and 7 turnovers while Russell Westbrook had 16 points on 5/15 shooting from the field with 7 turnovers.
Midway through the third quarter with the Lakers trailing by 19 points, James tried a baseline bounce pass that did not come close.
As James headed to the other end of the court, fans at Crypto.com Arena even booed the team and its superstar.
I ain’t worried about that, doesn’t bother me, that’s the part and I’m not really worried about it at all.
LeBron James said he's determined to improve down the road, pointing out that making seven turnovers is not exactly the recipe for success.
