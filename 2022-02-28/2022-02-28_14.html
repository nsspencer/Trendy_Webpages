     With Jeter and the Marlins, an Awkward Marriage Ends in Divorce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Derek Jeter crossed the threshold into baseball immortality last September with induction into the Hall of Fame.
Most people stop running at the finish line, but not Jeter.
Few had ever taken the stage while also holding a demanding executive position, putting off a cushy retirement.
Kim Ng was there for the ceremony that sunny day in Cooperstown, N.Y. As chief executive of the Miami Marlins, Jeter had hired Ng, a former Yankees official, as the first female general manager in baseball history.
He has never said this to me, but I’m sure he wants to experience winning on a number of different levels.

     Derek Jeter out as Marlins CEO
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Derek Jeter is out as Miami Marlins CEO, per reports this morning.
Jeter also is reportedly no longer a shareholder in the Marlins franchise.
This came out of nowhere, and the national guys on Twitter are saying this came as a shock to those around the Marlins.
Jeter was part of the group headed up by Bruce Sherman who bought the Marlins from Jeffrey Loria in 2017, and along with a 4% ownership interested was named the team CEO.
It could also be that he just doesn’t like doing the job anymore.

The bottom line is that Jeter could not abide by the way the owner wants to run the team.
Now is the right time for me to step aside as a new season begins.”The translation from one source familiar with the situation: “The player went back to being a player again.” It was about winning, as it always is for Jeter.
Even if there is no connection, Jeter just handed the players a win in 11th-hour labor negotiations.

     By TIM REYNOLDS AP Sports WriterMIAMI (AP) — Derek Jeter went into the offseason talking about the Miami Marlins spending more money on contracts, figuring out ways to contend and continuing to build for the future.
Jeter became CEO of the Marlins in September 2017 — and baseball’s first Black CEO — when Sherman bought the team from Jeffrey Loria.
Miami went 218-327 during his four seasons at the helm, finishing with a winning record only once at 31-29 in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.
In the full seasons under Jeter, the Marlins went 63-98, 57-105 and 67-95.
“I thank Derek for his service to the Marlins, the communities of Miami and the game,” MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said.

     Jeter understood the path to sustained winning in Miami would involve painful and unpopular decisions and years of not winning.
In real time in the offseason after the 2017 campaign, Jeter was condemned for dealing away the reigning NL MVP.
Jeter celebrates the Yankees World Series in 2009 Michael LoccisanoThe infighting mainly surrounded Jeter’s handpicked vice president of player development and scouting, Gary Denbo.
In an internal conference call with select department heads Monday before Jeter’s announcement went public, Sherman explained Jeter’s departure.
The belief is that without Jeter present, Denbo will stay, but Ng’s decision-making voice will become more dominant.
