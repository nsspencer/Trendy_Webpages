     With Jeter and the Marlins, an Awkward Marriage Ends in Divorce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Derek Jeter crossed the threshold into baseball immortality last September with induction into the Hall of Fame.
Most people stop running at the finish line, but not Jeter.
Few had ever taken the stage while also holding a demanding executive position, putting off a cushy retirement.
Kim Ng was there for the ceremony that sunny day in Cooperstown, N.Y. As chief executive of the Miami Marlins, Jeter had hired Ng, a former Yankees official, as the first female general manager in baseball history.
He has never said this to me, but I’m sure he wants to experience winning on a number of different levels.

     Derek Jeter out as Marlins CEO

     Derek Jeter is out as Miami Marlins CEO, per reports this morning.
Jeter also is reportedly no longer a shareholder in the Marlins franchise.
This came out of nowhere, and the national guys on Twitter are saying this came as a shock to those around the Marlins.
Jeter was part of the group headed up by Bruce Sherman who bought the Marlins from Jeffrey Loria in 2017, and along with a 4% ownership interested was named the team CEO.
It could also be that he just doesn’t like doing the job anymore.

     ESPN Wants Derek Jeter For TV

     ESPN is interested in Derek Jeter — if Derek Jeter is interested in TV.
ESPN Films announced a multipart documentary about Jeter called “The Captain” that will air on the network and ESPN+ later this year.
While ESPN could not offer Jeter a chance to call the Fall Classic, it could entice him with other roles.
Pitaro has shrewdly used his ESPN+ streaming platform to establish business relationships with superstars like Manning, Jeter and Tom Brady.
In the case of Peyton and Eli Manning, ESPN used that relationship as a basis to forge a bigger, more extensive partnership.

     Derek Jeter leaves post as Miami Marlins’ CEO, shareholderHis focus — or the Marlins’ focus — apparently has changed sinceby Associated PressMIAMI (AP) — Derek Jeter went into the offseason talking about the Miami Marlins spending more money on contracts, figuring out ways to contend and continuing to build for the future.
His focus — or the Marlins’ focus — apparently has changed since.
Jeter became CEO of the Marlins in September 2017 — and baseball’s first Black CEO — when Sherman bought the team from Jeffrey Loria.
Miami went 218-327 during his four seasons at the helm, finishing with a winning record only once at 31-29 in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.
In the full seasons under Jeter, the Marlins went 63-98, 57-105 and 67-95.
