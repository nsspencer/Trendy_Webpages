     'The Batman' flies high with its dark and serious Dark Knight, but hangs around too long
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) "The Batman" presents a muscular vision of the Dark Knight that hardcore fans have long desired, a dark and serious epic that's somewhat offset by two disclaimers: At nearly three hours, the movie hangs around too long, really feeling it down the stretch; and despite its origins, this detective-driven take owes more to movies like "Seven" and "L.A.
Batman again operates in a corrupt, muddy-toned Gotham whose ornate trappings are part New York, part "Blade Runner," and when pressed into action, his fights are bruising, not balletic.
The look might be stylized, but director/co-writer Matt Reeves has steeped Wayne's tragic history in gritty realism, even more so than Christopher Nolan's trilogy starring Christian Bale.
While running through the cast, there's also plenty to praise in Zoë Kravitz's Catwoman (a name never uttered, despite her fondness for felines), Jeffrey Wright's James Gordon and Paul Dano's Riddler.
Lurking in shadows, the Riddler engages them in a game of cat and mouse, sprinkling clues and taunting Batman, who has sought to strike fear into criminals' hearts, rumbling when one asks who he is, "I'm vengeance."

     The Batman review: 'A noirish pulp fantasy'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Don't expect any levity from Batman – sorry The Batman – either.
And when he is at home as Bruce Wayne, he's a sullen, pallid recluse who doesn't even have a kind word for his scarred, limping butler Alfred (Andy Serkis).
Still, maybe that's what life in Gotham City does to you.
Batman's voiceover may echo Rorschach's diary from the Watchmen comics, and there are inevitable similarities to previous Bat-films, but The Batman borrows so much from Se7en that it barely qualifies as a superhero movie.
In other words, we've come a long way from the days when Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr Freeze was turning Gotham City into a giant ice sculpture.

     'The Batman' review: You’ve never seen the Dark Knight like this before
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     You’ve seen gritty Batman before.
But you’ve never seen gritty Batman like this.
Thirty-five years after Frank Miller’s seminal The Dark Knight Returns, 17 years after Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins, and six years after Batman v Superman, framing Batman through the gritty filter is hardly ingenious.
Evocative of Tom King’s Batman, The Batman features Pattinson and Zoë Kravitz in a budding romance pregnant with tension and eroticism.
Even the movie’s stirring climax, powered by a literal shot of adrenaline, underlines its core idea: This Batman is totally unlike any iteration of the hero you’ve seen before.

     'The Batman' Review: Gripping Serial Killer Chiller Is Darkest Knight Ever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Following the murder of his parents (you know that bit), Bruce Wayne is two years into his crusade against Gotham City street crime.
As that synopsis suggests, The Batman (in theaters March 4) is barely a superhero movie.
Let's not get into the perennial argument among fans about whether superhero movies should be for kids or for grown-ups.
Jonathan Olley/DCThis explicitly scary Batman film opens with a sinister scene of jaw-tightening suspense, adding serial killer scares and even a few dashes of torture porn.
Like the Joker movie, The Batman explores the radicalizing effect of inequality on a repressed populace.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Unfortunately, the new Dark Knight doesn’t rise to the occasion.
Gotham is a rotting tinderbox on the brink of utter social collapse as The Batman opens on the city just a couple years into Bruce Wayne’s (Robert Pattinson) career as the Dark Knight.
Inexperienced as this new Batman is, he’s well past his days of merely looming in people’s imaginations as an urban myth.
This is also, one imagines, why there are so many scenes in which Bruce… is not particularly good at being Batman quite yet.
Compared to previous cinematic versions of Batman, this Dark Knight is more of a brawler who makes up for his lack of experience with his ability to take a punch.

     The Batman Is Sad, Scary, and Even a Little Sexy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There’s always been sexual tension between Batman and Catwoman, but The Batman, again, leans into this dynamic more fully than previous entries (yes, even more than Batman Returns).
There’s little differentiation here between Bruce Wayne and Batman, no alter-ego shenanigans.
Pattinson is a tall, handsome, strapping fellow, but he plays Bruce Wayne with such broken, mournful despair that his body is practically concave when it’s not in a batsuit.
Now, we have to try and figure out how the hero differs from the villain — and so too does Batman.
He has given us a Batman that he himself can believe in, not to mention a Batman that feels right for our times.
