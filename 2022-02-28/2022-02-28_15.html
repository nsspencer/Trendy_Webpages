     State officials reviewing new CDC guidelines but will still lift mask mandate on March 21

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     OLYMPIA, Wash. – Washington State’s March 21st date to lift the statewide mask mandate is still in place for now but state officials are reviewing new mask guidance from the CDC.
The new guidance says people in most places can safely take a break from wearing facial coverings.
CBS News Medical Contributor Dr. David Agus says the CDC is basing the guidance on hospitalization rates.
“The CDC now takes into account the hospitalization rate, or the occupancy rate, in an area in addition to the case rate in areas,” says Agus.
The agency is still advising that people, including schoolchildren, wear masks where the risk of COVID-19 is high.

     NORRISTOWN — The Montgomery County Office of Public Health announced Monday it will update its school and public masking recommendations to align with new CDC guidance for COVID-19 given the county’s high vaccination rates.
Updated guidance documents will be released later this week.
The CDC’s updated framework shifts from four levels of community transmission to three: low, medium, or high.
The Montgomery County Office of Public Health continues to operate four sites that offer the vaccine at no charge.
All eligible Montgomery County residents are urged to get a booster dose as soon as they are eligible.

Wear a mask or respirator that provides them with greater protection when the Covid-19 community level is high.
The CDC’s recommendations are only that, but it has maintained its order that travelers wear masks while using public transportation and indoor transportation hubs.

Not everyone has the choice, because mask requirement decisions remain with state and local officials.
California, Oregon, and Washington announced Monday that they are dropping mask requirements in schools in favor of mask recommendations.
"Because New Yorkers have stepped up, we can confidently remove the statewide mask requirement in our schools," Hochul said Sunday.

     The CDC issues new masking guidance as U.S. COVID cases dropThe CDC's new guidance means most of the U.S. population is considered to be at low or medium risk for COVID-19, and the agency has given the green light to take masks off.
The CDC also dropped its recommendation for universal masking in schools, leaving it up to local officials to decide.
Allison, as COVID cases have continue to drop, many states and cities have already dropped masking requirements.
Instead of focusing so much on COVID cases, now the focus is on preventing serious disease.
His message is that though mask guidance is changing, what's not changing is the evidence that high-quality masks in settings of high transmission are beneficial.
