     The King Cake Delivery Service That Has Reddit TerrifiedEach year, New Orleans celebrates Mardi Gras with great pomp, pride, music, picnics, parades, and, of course, carnivals.
As the city gets a purple, green, and gold makeover, the city's NBA team, the New Orleans Pelicans, gets a new seasonal mascot: The infamous King Cake Baby.
According to SBNation, the King Cake Baby debuted in 2014 and joins the New Orleans Pelicans' year-round mascot, Pierre the Pelican, around the time of Mardi Gras.
The mascot is inspired by a special food eaten during the Mardi Gras celebrations – the king cake.
In early January, the mascot's official account sent out an eerie tweet informing the world that the King Cake Baby was back after an 11-month nap and the internet is both tickled and terrified.

     King cake: The story behind the quintessential Mardi Gras treat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Get that king cake in you while you still can!
A king cake tends to be decorated with the colors of Mardi Gras, purple, green, and gold.
Being Christian is not a requirement for enjoying a king cake but, it's considered blasphemous to eat a king cake before January 6 and most bakeries stop making them on Mardi Gras.
A king cake, has many forms and flavors, though traditionally it's cinnamon and vanilla flavored.
It tends to be iced, nice, and decorated with the colors of Mardi Gras, purple, green, and gold.

     Celebrate Mardi Gras with a different kind of king cake
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Chief among those festivities is the consumption of the king cake, an O-shaped brioche-style cake laden with purple, yellow and green sprinkles and eaten specifically during this time of the year.
Luckily, there’s a variation of the king cake available here in the Twin Cities year-round.
Unlike its south of France-hailing, brioche-incorporating counterpart (the king cake we normally associate with Mardi Gras), the galette des rois uses puff pastry and almond frangipane.
Although galette des rois is typically eaten during Epiphany, the cakes are regularly available in early January through Mardi Gras.
So indulge in the king cake, whether you’re celebrating Mardi Gras or not, whether you’re repenting for your sins on Ash Wednesday or not.

     Universal Orlando Mardi Gras King Cake
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Hard to visualize a Mardi Gras celebration without “King Cake.” As a result, Universal Orlando offers several themed “King Cake” items.
At two different New Orleans themed tents, guests may buy the Universal Orlando Mardi Gras version of “King Cake.”For true New Orleans Mardi Gras fans, these cakes fail to meet anything resembling your version of “King Cake.” Also, for Louisiana Mardi Gas veterans, the “baby” resides on top of the cake to avoid any choking hazards at Universal Orlando.
However, the “King Cake” at 2022 Mardi Gras at Universal Orlando provides guests a solid dessert that they will hopefully share.
I wish they would call it a “King Cake Cinnamon Roll” to reduce confusion for people familiar with exact standards for traditional New Orleans style King Cake.
If you want to feed a few people a Mardi Gras themed dessert, this “King Cake” provides a good choice.

     What is a king cake? Follow the pastry's journey from biblical symbol to Mardi Gras staple
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Plastic baby aside, eating a colorful king cake for Mardi Gras is a cinnamon-sugary tradition.
Mardi Gras.
The king cake is a sweet pastry now synonymous with Mardi Gras, but it's taken on various forms over its hundreds of years in existence.
The chef's favorite king cake comes from Manny Randazzo's King Cakes, a purist favorite since 1965 that draws crowds and receives worldwide acclaim.
King cakes are commonly only sold during Carnival until Fat Tuesday, but some bakeries have started selling them year-round because of demand, ushering in heated debates about when king cakes should and should not be available.
