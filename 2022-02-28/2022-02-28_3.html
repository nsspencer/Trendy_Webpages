     Belarus referendum approves proposal to renounce non-nuclear status - agencies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko casts his ballot at the referendum on the amendments and additions to the Constitution of Belarus, in Minsk, Belarus February 27, 2022.
The agencies cited the Belarus central elections commission as saying 65.2% of those who took part voted in favor.
Protests had largely died down in Belarus after Lukashenko launched a violent crackdown on dissent against his 28-year-long rule.
On Sunday, speaking at a polling station, Lukashenko said he could ask Russia to return nuclear weapons to Belarus.
"If you (the West) transfer nuclear weapons to Poland or Lithuania, to our borders, then I will turn to Putin to return the nuclear weapons that I gave away without any conditions," Lukashenko said.

     Belarus votes to give up non-nuclear status
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Putin on Sunday ordered Russian nuclear deterrent forces be put on high alert in a dramatic escalation of tensions with the West.
Speaking at a polling station on Sunday, Lukashenko said that he could ask Russia to return nuclear weapons to Belarus.
“If you [the West] transfer nuclear weapons to Poland or Lithuania, to our borders, then I will turn to Putin to return the nuclear weapons that I gave away without any conditions,” Lukashenko said.
The office of Ukraine’s president on Sunday said a delegation would meet Russian officials near the Belarus border.
The Ukrainian foreign minister said he received reassurances that Belarus would not get involved in the war while talks went on.

     The result came as little surprise, given the tightly controlled rule of President Alexander Lukashenko.
The new constitution could see nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union.

The official said that Belarusian troops could deploy to Ukraine as soon as Monday.

     The authoritarian leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, tells Russian media that Western sanctions are pushing Russia toward a new world war.
Russia is being pushed toward a third world war.
Because nuclear war is the end of everything,” Lukashenko tells the Russian state media outlet Tass.
He says the US is the “sole beneficiary” of the war, and says Belarus and Moscow will enact “painful” sanctions against the West.
Russian state media has been widely discredited as pro-Russian propaganda during the war and has been sanctioned by leading online platforms.

     Lukashenko tries to consolidate power while Ukraine burns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russia sent about 30,000 troops to Belarus in recent weeks, and they’ve been used to attack Ukraine.
But Lukashenko insisted his troops aren’t taking part in the invasion, saying there is “not a single Belarusian soldier, not a single cartridge” in Ukraine.
Belarus relies on Russian cash to keep the government afloat after the EU and U.S. hit the country with sanctions.
Despite earlier insistence that the Russian troops would head home once military exercises were finished, the government now says they’ll remain indefinitely.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Lukashenko to ensure the withdrawal of Russian troops from Belarus.
