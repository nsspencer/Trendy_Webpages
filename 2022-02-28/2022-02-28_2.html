     The ‘go fuck yourself’ Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island are alive, navy says
    </h2>

     Last week, in a display of defiance, a Ukrainian soldier told the Russian warship that came to attack them: “Go fuck yourself.” | Aleksey fILIPPOV/AFP via Getty ImagesUkrainian soldiers who were defending Snake Island are “alive and well,” the Ukrainian navy announced Monday.
In a Facebook post, the navy said that the military personnel defending Snake Island, also known as Zmiinyi Island, in the Black Sea are alive and in Russian captivity.
“We are very happy to learn that our brothers are alive and well,” the post said.
Snake Island is small but strategically important for the defense of Ukraine’s territorial waters and among its southernmost settlements.
“All the defenders of Snake Island died, but they did not surrender,” Zelenskyy said in a video posted on Telegram.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 13 Ukrainian border guards-turned-international-heroes that had reportedly been killed after telling a Russian warship to “go fuck yourself” instead of surrendering their post were confirmed to be alive on Sunday by the Ukrainian Navy .
“This is a Russian warship,” the invaders announced.
And while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself had confirmed late Thursday that the guards had “died heroically” defending the island, the guards are alive and have been taken prisoner by Russian forces.
Zelenskyy has yet to comment on this new revelation regarding the Snake Island border guards.

     Snake Island's defiant soldiers are 'alive and well,' says Ukraine's navy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ukrainian Navy says soldiers who cursed out Russian warship are still aliveCNN —The Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island – who were all feared dead after their defiant response to threats from a Russian warship – are actually “alive and well,” according to the Ukrainian Navy.
All of the soldiers on the tiny island in the Black Sea were thought to have been killed in an attack on the first day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last Thursday.
Russian state media also showed the arrival of the Ukrainian soldiers in Sevastopol, Crimea where they are being held.
Snake Island, also known as Zmiinyi Island, sits about 30 miles (48 kilometers) off the southern tip of the Ukrainian mainland in the northwestern Black Sea.
It’s about 185 miles west of Crimea, the Ukrainian territory that Russia annexed in 2014.

     Ukrainian Military Says Soldiers at Snake Island Survived
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Ukrainian military is reporting that the soldiers who famously told Russian invaders to “Go fuck yourselves” are still alive and being held captive, despite initial reports saying they had been killed.
In an audio recording widely shared online, a Russian ship could be heard addressing the crew of 13 guarding Snake Island, off Ukraine’s southwest coast.
The Russian ship instructed the crew to lay down their weapons or “be bombed.”“Go fuck yourselves,” the Ukrainians said in response.
However, the Ukrainian Navy announced in a Feb. 28, 2022, Facebook post that the 13 soldiers were not dead; they were in fact alive and well and being held captive.
The Ukrainian Navy said it had at first believed that the soldiers were dead because Russian bombardment destroyed the island’s infrastructure, and thus they were unable to communicate with the crew.

     (Gray News) - The Ukrainian navy says the soldiers of Snake Island who defied orders from an invading Russian vessel to lay down their arms are “alive and well,” according to CNN.
“I am a Russian military ship proposing to put down (your) arms immediately to avoid bloodshed and unjustified deaths,” begins the recording.
“In worst case, you will be hit with a bomb strike.”The Ukrainian navy released a statement saying the soldiers fought off two attacks from the Russians before being forced to surrender.
The soldiers were reportedly shown on Russian state media arriving where they are currently being held in Sevastopol, Crimea.

Ukrainian soldiers were occupying the island, which is located about 20 miles off shore, when a Russian ship approached and a Russian officer offered a stern warning, according to unverified audio.
In the audio clip of what purportedly took place next, a voice could be heard telling the Ukrainian soldiers: "This is a Russian military warship.
There was a brief exchange before one Ukrainian soldier allegedly said in response: "Russian warship, go f--- yourself."
The Ukrainian Navy added that Russian soldiers "completely destroyed the island's infrastructure: lighthouses, towers, antennas, etc."
