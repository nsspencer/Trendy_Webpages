     ‘The Batman’ and Matt Reeves: Emerging From the Shadow of Other Caped Crusaders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Reeves was deep into postproduction on “War” when Warner Bros. approached him about directing Affleck’s Batman movie.
After reviewing that script, Reeves called it “a totally valid and cool take” on the character, “an action set-piece adventure” that he likened to a James Bond movie for the studio’s extended universe of DC superheroes.
“I just didn’t know how I would direct that,” Reeves said.
Despite the studio’s interest, he said, “I don’t think you’re going to want me because I wouldn’t do this.
And then they asked me what I would do.”This wasn’t a question Reeves was immediately prepared to answer.

     The Batman movie review &amp; film summary (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This is no flirty, purring Catwoman: She’s a fighter and a survivor with a loyal heart and a strong sense of what’s right.
Following her lead role in Steven Soderbergh’s high-tech thriller “Kimi,” Kravitz continues to reveal a fierce charisma and quiet strength.
Despite the overlong running time of nearly three hours, this is a film that’s consistently viscerally gripping.
His use of shadow and silhouette is masterful, and does so much to convey a sense of foreboding and tension.
This is the most beautiful Batman movie you’ve ever seen—even if it’s not really a Batman movie at all.

     'The Batman' review: You’ve never seen the Dark Knight like this before
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     You’ve seen gritty Batman before.
But you’ve never seen gritty Batman like this.
Thirty-five years after Frank Miller’s seminal The Dark Knight Returns, 17 years after Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins, and six years after Batman v Superman, framing Batman through the gritty filter is hardly ingenious.
Evocative of Tom King’s Batman, The Batman features Pattinson and Zoë Kravitz in a budding romance pregnant with tension and eroticism.
Even the movie’s stirring climax, powered by a literal shot of adrenaline, underlines its core idea: This Batman is totally unlike any iteration of the hero you’ve seen before.

     In back-to-basics 'The Batman,' Robert Pattinson shines in the darkness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Reeves and his co-writer Peter Craig have settled upon a back-to-basics approach to Batman and his world.
This Batman is back-to-basicsReeves doesn't seem interested in offering us a singular, discrete and distinctly Reevesian cinematic Batman.
Robert Pattinson's Batman puts the emo in emoteBut it's Pattinson who makes the film what it is.
As a result of this expressive vulnerability, Pattinson's Batman is unique in following a clear narrative and emotional arc over the course of the film.
But while Matt Reeves' The Batman was unspooling before me, I didn't check my phone, didn't think about the passing of time.

     The Batman review: 2022 movie is The Stylish, The Maximalist, and The Interminable.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Less an origin story than a coming-of-age tale, The Batman captures the title character only two years into his crimefighting career.
As played by the smoldering English actor Robert Pattinson, Bruce Wayne is both younger and more vulnerable than the bat-dudes we’re accustomed to seeing.
AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementStill, Reeves’ and Pattinson’s vision of the Batman as a Hamlet-like heir unable to move past the primal shock of his parents’ murder has a certain emotional power.
With his black carapace, inexhaustible riches, and impossible-to-defeat technology, Bruce Wayne can be a forbiddingly invulnerable character.
AdvertisementAdvertisementThis is the 12th live-action movie to feature the Batman character since Michael Keaton played him in Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman.

     The Batman is young, dumb, and full of soft-spoken ennui
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Unfortunately, the new Dark Knight doesn’t rise to the occasion.
Gotham is a rotting tinderbox on the brink of utter social collapse as The Batman opens on the city just a couple years into Bruce Wayne’s (Robert Pattinson) career as the Dark Knight.
Inexperienced as this new Batman is, he’s well past his days of merely looming in people’s imaginations as an urban myth.
This is also, one imagines, why there are so many scenes in which Bruce… is not particularly good at being Batman quite yet.
Compared to previous cinematic versions of Batman, this Dark Knight is more of a brawler who makes up for his lack of experience with his ability to take a punch.
