     Ukrainian navy confirms Snake Island soldiers alive, taken by Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Ukrainian navy announced on Monday that it was aware that the border guards on Snake Island who were at first thought to have died in a Russian assault were in fact alive and being held prisoner by the Russians.
It was initially reported that 13 Ukrainian soldiers, stationed in the small Black Sea island, were killed by Russian forces after keeping two Russian military ships out of the island for several hours.
In response, as shown in audio shared by the Ukrainian news outlet Ukrayinska Pravda, they replied "go f*** yourself, Russian warship."
The navy added that a civilian ship had gone to the island to help the victims after the attack, but it was captured by the Russians.
(credit: Wikimedia Commons)At just 0.17 square kilometers in size, the island has a very small population of no more than 100 people.

     Snake Island Ukrainians found alive, taken as Russian prisoners
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 13 Ukrainian border guards-turned-international-heroes that had reportedly been killed after telling a Russian warship to “go fuck yourself” instead of surrendering their post were confirmed to be alive on Sunday by the Ukrainian Navy .
“This is a Russian warship,” the invaders announced.
And while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself had confirmed late Thursday that the guards had “died heroically” defending the island, the guards are alive and have been taken prisoner by Russian forces.
Zelenskyy has yet to comment on this new revelation regarding the Snake Island border guards.

     The ‘go fuck yourself’ Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island are alive, navy says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Last week, in a display of defiance, a Ukrainian soldier told the Russian warship that came to attack them: “Go fuck yourself.” | Aleksey fILIPPOV/AFP via Getty ImagesUkrainian soldiers who were defending Snake Island are “alive and well,” the Ukrainian navy announced Monday.
In a Facebook post, the navy said that the military personnel defending Snake Island, also known as Zmiinyi Island, in the Black Sea are alive and in Russian captivity.
“We are very happy to learn that our brothers are alive and well,” the post said.
Snake Island is small but strategically important for the defense of Ukraine’s territorial waters and among its southernmost settlements.
“All the defenders of Snake Island died, but they did not surrender,” Zelenskyy said in a video posted on Telegram.

     Ukrainians who told Russian warship ‘go f–k yourself’ are still alive: officials

     The Ukrainian border guards who told a Russian warship to “go f–k yourself” as they defended Snake Island in the Black Sea are still alive and being held captive by the invading forces, Kyiv’s navy revealed Monday.
Facebook/Armed Forces of UkraineRussia claimed on Friday that the Ukrainian guards had actually surrendered — and made no mention of carrying out strikes.
“This is a Russian warship,” an unidentified voice can be heard saying.
“Russian warship, go f–k yourself,” the Ukrainians replied.
A video clip of the Ukrainian service members saying “Russian warship, go f–k yourself” went viral.

     The defenders of Snake Island in the Black Sea, who were initially feared dead, are “alive and well,” according to the Ukrainian Navy.
Over the weekend, the Ukrainian Border Guard Service said they had received information that all 82 soldiers may be alive.
Russian state media also showed the arrival of the Ukrainian soldiers in Sevastopol, Crimea, where they are being held.
More background: Snake Island sits about 30 miles (48 kilometers) off the southern tip of the Ukrainian mainland in the northwestern Black Sea.
It's about 185 miles (300 kilometers) west of Crimea, the Ukrainian territory that Russia annexed in 2014.

“On our island Zmiiny (Snake Island), defending it to the last, all the border guards died heroically.
With a land area of less than one-tenth of a square mile, Zmiinyi Island, otherwise known as Snake Island, is little more than a rock in the Black Sea, according to the Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank.
