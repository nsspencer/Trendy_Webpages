     In State of the Union, Biden Will Focus on Economy and Global Response to Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     White House officials and their allies on Capitol Hill fear they could lose control of both chambers if Mr. Biden is unable to turn those numbers around.
Officials said Mr. Biden will also announce new steps to confront price increases caused by a lack of competition.
Those companies have significantly increased their shipping rates through the pandemic, the White House said on Monday.
The Justice Department and the Federal Maritime Commission together will crack down on antitrust violations among shipping companies, to try to bring more competition into the sector.
Federal shipping regulators will also step up their oversight of certain practices by shipping companies, like unfair fees.

     One Thing Lawmakers Won't Bicker Over at the State of the Union: Masks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There will be one less thing to divide Congress when lawmakers convene for President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday: masks.
Brian Monahan, the Capitol’s attending physician, announced over the weekend that masks would no longer be required on the House floor.
It follows new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which eases most Covid-era restrictions for regions experiencing low transmission rates and a decrease in hospitalizations.

     Law enforcement factors potential protests and unrest into State of the Union security precautions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Law enforcement in Washington, DC, said Monday that the Russian invasion of Ukraine, potential protests of President Joe Biden and a possible trucker convoy headed to the Washington area are all factoring into a heightened security response for the State of the Union address Tuesday night.
Under the federal designation, the US Secret Service is the lead agency for the design and implementation of the operational security plan.
During such an event, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is responsible for response and recovery operations, and the FBI is the lead for investigative work and counterterrorism.
"There is the potential for Russian disinformation," Rodriguez said during the briefing, standing alongside Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and local and federal law enforcement officials.
"This wouldn't be the first time the Russians have done that across the United States in the last several years."

     State of the Union: Amid disputes, common cause for Ukraine - American Press

     They have argued viciously in Congress over just about everything: Whether the Capitol insurrection should be investigated or brushed aside.
Email newsletter signup“I think you will see in the State of the Union, a strong bipartisan support for our president,” predicts Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a Biden ally.
It can’t be said that Republicans are fully pleased with Biden’s handling of the Ukraine war.
McConnell has been highly critical of the president’s runup to the crisis, calling the White House’s disastrous exit from Afghanistan last summer a sign of U.S. weakness that opened the door to Putin’s invasion.
Leading Republican lawmakers have derided what defense hawks view as Biden’s initial reluctance to impose sanctions to deter Putin’s advance on Ukraine.
