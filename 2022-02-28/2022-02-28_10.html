     Dunks going in and out have been good enough to make his highlight videos and be placed on posters across Memphis.
Morant created one of the most poster-worthy dunks of his NBA career Monday when he slammed it home against San Antonio Spurs 7-footer Jakob Poeltl.
Morant took off from the edge of the paint area and jumped so quickly that Poeltl wasn't able to time his steps.
Morant wasn't done yet.
With 0.4 seconds left in the first half, Steven Adams launched a 90-foot pass to the left corner, where Morant jumped, tipped the ball and nailed a buzzer-beater as the clock expired.

Morant scored 52 points on 22-of-30 shooting to help the Grizzlies beat the San Antonio Spurs 118-105 on Monday night.
Morant added 13 consecutive points during the fourth quarter to break the game open, following up a career-best 46 points in a win Saturday at Chicago that initially set the franchise record.
He hit all four 3-point tries against the Spurs as Memphis won its second straight.
Morant's performance was the first 50-point game in Grizzlies franchise history.
