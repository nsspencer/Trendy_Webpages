     Time to Buy the Russia Stock Market Dip? Consider These Stocks.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Russia-Ukraine crisis has knocked U.S. stocks down, but not as much as European stocks.
And that’s why investors who want to buy the dip should look overseas.
The Euro Stoxx 600, the European counterpart of the S&amp;P 500, is off 4.1% since Feb. 10, the day before Russia ratcheted up its saber-rattling and stocks worldwide went into a free fall.
The S&amp;P 500 is down 2.9% since then.

     Moscow’s stock market is closed, but these Russian ETFs continue to trade in the U.S. Here’s why
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Much more interesting is the fact that the Russian stock market in Moscow is closed, but U.S.-based Russian exchange-traded funds are trading in the U.S. this morning.
How can Russian ETFs trade when the underlying securities are not trading?
Greece was closed for six weeks several years ago, but Greek ETFs in the U.S. continued to trade.
When the Greek market finally reopened, the Greek stocks priced at almost exactly what the ETFs were trading them for.
What this means is that ETFs can be on the market, even with the underlying market closed.

     Stocks Close Well Off Day’s Lows While Bonds Climb: Markets Wrap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stocks almost wiped out their losses, while bonds rose as traders assessed the latest developments after a wall of sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine.
The S&amp;P 500 trimmed a drop that reached 1.6% earlier in the day, while still notching its second month of declines -- the longest losing streak since October 2020.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 finished higher on Monday.
In late trading, Zoom Video Communications Inc. tumbled after the remote-conferencing giant projected sales that fell short of Wall Street’s estimates.

     Stock market news today: Dow and S&amp;P 500 updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The collapse of the Russian ruble following the latest round of sanctions from the United States and Western Europe may be manna from heaven for cryptocurrency bulls.
That's because the ruble's fall is a sign that government-backed currencies, which are typically viewed as being relatively safe, can still be incredibly risky.
Bitcoin prices surged more than 10% Monday to above $41,500, their highest level in nearly two weeks.
"Bitcoin and all the top altcoins are rallying today as investors realize the likelihood of massive investments into DeFi following the latest round of Russian sanctions," he added.
To that end, the price of ethereum — the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency after bitcoin — surged more than 8%, while binance coin and XRP were each up about 7%.

     Pseudo Russian Stock Market Created By U.S. ETFs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The two main Russian stock ETFs in the U.S. are the VanEck Russia ETF and the iShares MSCI Russia Capped ETF.
The Moscow stock market was closed for trading Monday in light of the financial turmoil caused by the conflict in Ukraine.
That has turned the two main Russian-stock ETFs traded in the U.S. into a de facto Russian stock market.
The Van Eck fund is based on the MVIS Russia Index, and the iShares fund on the MSCI Russia 25/50 Index.
It also happened when the Greek stock market was closed for five weeks in 2015, but Greek stock ETFS continued to trade in the U.S., CNBC pointed out..

     With Russia’s stock market closed, U.S. exchange-traded funds are signaling the scale of the rout facing the nation’s equity market.
The VanEck Russia ETF (ticker RSX) and the iShares MSCI Russia Capped ETF ( ERUS) plunged 30% and 27%, respectively, in U.S. trading Monday.
Millions have poured into the funds in the past week, some of which was likely create-to-lend activity in which new shares are created for short sellers to borrow and bet against.

     Stocks fall, ruble dives as Russia sanctions hit world markets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Authorities ordered exporting companies to sell 80% of their foreign revenues as the ruble slid as much as 32% before recouping some losses.
European banks were hit hard, with those most exposed to Russia, including Austria's Raiffeisen Bank (RBIV.VI), UniCredit (CRDI.MI) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), falling between 9.5% and 14%.
The White House said it hasn't ruled out restrictions on U.S. purchases of Russian oil and gas.
Even if Western governments allow the purchase of oil and gas from Russia, markets need to digest the disruption to hedging contracts, insurance coverage and energy markets, said Christopher Smart, chief global strategist at Barings Investment Institute.

     Russia Stocks Crash Even With Moscow Exchange Closed—Experts Call Market ‘Uninvestable’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ToplineThough Russia’s central bank closed the Moscow Stock Exchange on Monday, a number of Russia-focused funds trading in the United States crashed Monday, reflecting hundreds of millions of dollars in market value wiped from Russian stocks as international sanctions against the country prompted experts to reconsider the viability of investing in its market.
Russia-focused funds plummeted 25% Monday, as individual stocks crashed as much as 75%.
Losses piled on so much Monday that the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq both temporarily halted trading of some Russia-based stocks and ETFs on Monday, as is common during periods of high volatility.
The selloff on Monday pushed Russian stocks down nearly 50% over the past week, while the nation’s ruble sank to an all-time low of nearly 118 against the U.S. dollar in offshore trading.
TangentU.S. markets have also suffered amid the tumult in recent days—albeit not nearly as much.
