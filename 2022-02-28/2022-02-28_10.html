     White House officials and their allies on Capitol Hill fear they could lose control of both chambers if Mr. Biden is unable to turn those numbers around.
Officials said Mr. Biden will also announce new steps to confront price increases caused by a lack of competition.
Those companies have significantly increased their shipping rates through the pandemic, the White House said on Monday.
The Justice Department and the Federal Maritime Commission together will crack down on antitrust violations among shipping companies, to try to bring more competition into the sector.
Federal shipping regulators will also step up their oversight of certain practices by shipping companies, like unfair fees.

     Masks optional for Biden's State of the Union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON — Masks will be optional for members of Congress and others attending President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday, the Capitol's attending physician, Brian P. Monahan, said in a notice Sunday.
The notice said that KN95 or N95 masks are no longer required, and wearing a mask "is now an individual choice option."
He noted that the Washington, D.C. region is now in the "green level," or a low level of risk that allows for reduced coronavirus prevention measures.
Many Republican lawmakers on the Hill went without masks even under the requirement to wear them in the House.
Biden is slated to deliver his first State of the Union address as president at 9 p.m.

     White House press secretary later said the president will "absolutely" reference inflation directly.
"It's time for Congress to get him a piece of legislation that addresses those core challenges for families right now."
Addressing those issues — like child care, family and medical leave, energy costs and health care premiums — would lower costs for families, administration officials argued.
"The president is proud of the administration's progress to date," and will continue to build on it, one official on the call said.
The president's State of the Union address will air at 9 p.m.

     Tlaib to give progressive response to State of the Union
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rep. Rashida Tlaib is set to give the Working Families Party response to President Biden’s State of the Union address on Tuesday.
Tlaib — one of the members of the “Squad” of progressives in Congress — reportedly plans to criticize both Republicans and some Democrats for blocking Biden’s Build Back Better economic agenda.
Traditionally, the major political party that is not in power gives an official response to the president’s joint session to Congress.
Kim Reynolds will deliver the Republican Party’s response to Biden’s address, GOP leaders announced last week.
But in the last few years the Working Families Party has offered a progressive take on curing the nation’s ills.

     The White House will stream it live on its website, as will news networks through Facebook.
Going back to Lyndon B. Johnson, the average length of presidents’ State of the Union remarks is roughly 50 minutes.
Biden’s immediate predecessor, Donald Trump, delivered three State of the Union addresses, all surpassing one hour in length.
Trump’s 2019 speech lasted 1 hour and 22 minutes, the third-longest State of the Union address ever.
Bill Clinton holds the record for the longest State of the Union speech, lasting 1 hour and 29 minutes, according to the American Presidency Project.

     State of the Union: Amid disputes, common cause for Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     WASHINGTON (AP) — They have argued viciously in Congress over just about everything: Whether the Capitol insurrection should be investigated or brushed aside.
“I think you will see in the State of the Union, a strong bipartisan support for our president,” predicts Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a Biden ally.
It can't be said that Republicans are fully pleased with Biden’s handling of the Ukraine war.
McConnell has been highly critical of the president's runup to the crisis, calling the White House’s disastrous exit from Afghanistan last summer a sign of U.S. weakness that opened the door to Putin’s invasion.
Leading Republican lawmakers have derided what defense hawks view as Biden's initial reluctance to impose sanctions to deter Putin’s advance on Ukraine.
