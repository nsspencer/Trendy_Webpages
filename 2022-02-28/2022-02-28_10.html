     What is a ‘vacuum bomb’ that Ukraine says Russia is using?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ukraine’s ambassador to the US and human rights groups said on Monday that Russia has been attacking the country with vacuum bombs and cluster bombs.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said that Russian troops are using widely banned cluster munitions.
Ukrainian ambassador Oksana Markarova told reporters that Russia has used a thermobaric weapon, which is also known as a vacuum bomb, in its invasion of her country.
"They used the vacuum bomb today," Markarova said on Monday, after a meeting with lawmakers.
A thermobaric weapon or a vacuum bomb is used to suck in the oxygen from the surrounding area to generate a high-temperature explosion.

     What are thermobaric weapons and how do they work?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fears have risen over the use of thermobaric weapons by Russia after the Ukrainian ambassador to the US said a vacuum bomb – another term for the weapon – had been used during the invasion.
The thermobaric weapon, also known as an aerosol bomb or fuel air explosive, is a two-stage munition.
Hellyer said thermobaric weapons were effective at their “specific purpose” of “primarily destroying defensive positions”.
Given their use is “pretty standard” in terms of Russian tactics, Hellyer said he expected to see more thermobaric warfare in Ukraine.
“It’s clear that the Ukrainians are hunkering down in some of the cities … as that continues the Russians are going to resort more and more to using … whatever weapons they have including thermobaric weapons in built-up urban areas.”Reuters contributed to this report

     Russia used vacuum bomb during invasion, Ukrainian ambassador claims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russia used a vacuum bomb on the fifth day of its invasion of Ukraine, it has been claimed.
The bomb, also known as a thermobaric weapon or aerosol bomb, draws oxygen from the atmosphere to create a bigger and more devastating explosion.
The claim was made by Oksana Markarova – the Ukrainian ambassador to the US – who was approached by reporters after a meeting with White House lawmakers in which aid for Ukraine was discussed.
She did not reveal where the vacuum bomb was unleashed.
Ms Markarova told reporters: “They used the vacuum bomb today, which is actually prohibited by the Geneva convention.

     Russia has been accused of attacking Ukrainians with cluster bombs and vacuum bombs, weapons that have been condemned by a variety of international organisations.
There has been no official confirmation that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.
Vacuum bombs not newRussian troops move towards the major cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv, while shelling continues in Chernihiv and Zhytomyr.
Because of the way in which vacuum bombs kill people, there would likely be a move towards banning them, Professor Saul believes.
Amnesty International said international humanitarian law prohibited the use of inherently indiscriminate weapons such as cluster munitions.
