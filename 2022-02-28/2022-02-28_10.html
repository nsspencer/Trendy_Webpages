     Derek Jeter Steps Down as Chief Executive of the Marlins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Derek Jeter, the Hall of Fame shortstop for the Yankees, resigned on Monday as the chief executive of the Miami Marlins, ending an ambitious second career after four and a half years in charge of one of baseball’s most vexing franchises.
In a statement, Jeter said he would no longer serve as an investor or a shareholder with the Marlins.
He held a 4 percent stake as part of a group that paid $1.2 billion for the franchise in 2017.
The group was led by Bruce Sherman, a wealth-management executive from New York.
That said, the vision for the future of the franchise is different than the one I signed up to lead.
