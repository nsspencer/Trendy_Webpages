     — Instagram/FileFormer Miss Ukraine Anastasia Lenna has announced that she is joining the country's army against Russia.
Posting a picture in the army's uniform on Instagram, she could be seen holding an assault rifle while wearing the gear.
She urged fellow countrymen to resist the invasion as well and one of her suggestions was to confuse the Russian troops by taking down road signs.
“Everyone who crosses the Ukrainian border with the intent to invade will be killed,” she wrote on social media.
In her praise for Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, she called him a “true and strong leader”, as she urged for international support against Russia's invasion.
