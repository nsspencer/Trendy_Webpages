     NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal says without Lebron James, the Lakers will never win again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal issued a stark warning to the Los Angeles Lakers Monday, saying despite an abysmal season, it would be a huge mistake to trade the team's biggest superstar, Lebron James.
"If you trade LeBron, you'll never win again," O'Neal said of the Lakers in an interview with CNBC.
While the NBA trade deadline has passed, James' contract with the Lakers expires in 2023.
O'Neal himself played eight seasons with the Lakers, leading the team to three championships alongside Kobe Bryant.
O'Neal, who also serves as an TNT Broadcaster, said Monday the Lakers should be focusing on surrounding James with the right set of players.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LeBron James said he had a “candid” conversation with The Athletic’s Bill Oram on Sunday night after the Lakers’ 123–95 loss to the Pelicans.
James criticized Oram after a report he wrote that James said was not accurate.
“[Oram] and I had a candid conversation after the game tonight and I know he has a job to do,” James said in the tweet.
After Friday’s loss to the Clippers, James addressed the reported tensions between himself and the Lakers by Oram.
“Bill doesn't like the Lakers anyway, so it's always gonna be a negative any time Bill says anything about the Lakers it's gonna be negative so I hope no one in Lakers faithful listen to Bill Oram,” James said.

     Check out the highlights of DeAndre Jordan's big blocks and rim-rocking slams for the Lakers.
(1:37)The Philadelphia 76ers are emerging as front-runners to acquire center DeAndre Jordan either as a waiver claim or a free-agent signing, sources told ESPN on Monday.
The Sixers have an open roster spot to take on Jordan, who started 19 games this season before dropping out of Los Angeles' rotation.
Jordan was All-NBA first team with the LA Clippers in 2016 and a two-time All-NBA defensive first-team choice in 2015 and '16.

     Before this season started, NBA analysts and experts had their doubts about the Lakers.
And while that is very terrible for the Lakers and their fans, one Vegas bettor could reap the rewards.
Per SportsLine, someone placed a $10,000 bet with MGM before the season started that Los Angeles would not make the playoffs.
And right now, Los Angeles is 27-33 and sitting in the 9th seed in the Western Conference.
It's bad out in Los Angeles.

     Lakers reportedly intend to waive DeAndre Jordan, sign D.J. Augustin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Lakers reportedly intend to waive center DeAndre Jordan to clear up space to sign veteran free agent guard D.J.
Jordan, 33, has essentially been a non-factor in Los Angeles since joining the Lakers in free agency last summer.
The Lakers will reportedly swap Jordan out for Augustin, who last played for the Rockets earlier this month before he was waived on Feb. 10.
During his time in Houston this season, Augustin averaged just 5.4 points and 2.2 assists in 15 minutes per game.
In related news, Charania also reported that the Lakers plan to sign free agent forward Wenyen Gabriel to a two-way contract.

Two other notable veterans from the preseason Lakers graphic, Marc Gasol and Rajon Rondo, are no longer on the team.
Los Angeles traded away both and landed little from Memphis and Cleveland in return.

During a devastating 123-95 loss to the Pelicans, fans booed the Lakers at Crypto.com Arena.
And video appears to show LeBron James and Trevor Ariza responding to the angry crowd.
It doesn’t bother me none.”Sunday’s loss was the Lakers’ ninth defeat in the past 12 games, dipping their record to 27-33.
DeAndre Jordan threw a wide pass to Wayne Ellington that hit court-side fans in an embarrassing blooper.

     All the boos the Lakers encountered during their uninspiring 28-point loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday night was just one of many things they had to face.
After he scored 16 points, but had just one assist and seven turnovers, Russell Westbrook was asked if the booing bothered him.
The Lakers committed 23 of them, including seven each by James and Westbrook.
“Obviously seven turnovers is not an ingredient for winning basketball for myself.
In the eyes of Lakers coach Frank Vogel, there is only one thing for the Lakers to do after losing so badly to the Pelicans.

     The team plans to waive backup big man DeAndre Jordan and sign free agent guard DJ Augustin, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic.
The Lakers also plan to sign forward Wenyen Gabriel to a two-way contract, per Charania.
Jordan appeared in 32 games for the Lakers this season and played 12.8 minutes per performance.
Augustin played in 34 games for the Houston Rockets, but he was waived by the team earlier this month.
Similarly, Jordan will likely be signed elsewhere in order to provide some frontcourt fortification for a team in the playoff hunt.

     LeBron James had 32 points and 7 turnovers while Russell Westbrook had 16 points on 5/15 shooting from the field with 7 turnovers.
Midway through the third quarter with the Lakers trailing by 19 points, James tried a baseline bounce pass that did not come close.
As James headed to the other end of the court, fans at Crypto.com Arena even booed the team and its superstar.
I ain’t worried about that, doesn’t bother me, that’s the part and I’m not really worried about it at all.
LeBron James said he's determined to improve down the road, pointing out that making seven turnovers is not exactly the recipe for success.
