     NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal says without Lebron James, the Lakers will never win again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal issued a stark warning to the Los Angeles Lakers Monday, saying despite an abysmal season, it would be a huge mistake to trade the team's biggest superstar, Lebron James.
"If you trade LeBron, you'll never win again," O'Neal said of the Lakers in an interview with CNBC.
While the NBA trade deadline has passed, James' contract with the Lakers expires in 2023.
O'Neal himself played eight seasons with the Lakers, leading the team to three championships alongside Kobe Bryant.
O'Neal, who also serves as an TNT Broadcaster, said Monday the Lakers should be focusing on surrounding James with the right set of players.

     Lakers Signing Veteran Point Guard D.J. Augustin to a Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Athletic's Shams Charania reported today that the Lakers are signing a new name.
They are adding in veteran point guard D.J.
The 34-year-old point guard has been putting up 5.4 points per game while averaging 15 minutes a game.
Augustin also added to the wing depth, something the Lakers have really needed all season long.
In order to make room for Augustin on the roster, the Lakers reportedly plan on waiving DeAndre Jordan.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Before this season started, NBA analysts and experts had their doubts about the Lakers.
And while that is very terrible for the Lakers and their fans, one Vegas bettor could reap the rewards.
Per SportsLine, someone placed a $10,000 bet with MGM before the season started that Los Angeles would not make the playoffs.
And right now, Los Angeles is 27-33 and sitting in the 9th seed in the Western Conference.
It's bad out in Los Angeles.

     Shaquille O’Neal on Lakers: “If you trade LeBron, you’ll never win again”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The mix of LeBron James being dramatic and the massive Lakers fan base already leads to hyperbole, but Monday afternoon Shaquille O’Neal took it to a whole new level.
Shaq was on CNBC talking crypto and his roughly 6,347 endorsement/franchise deals when the topic turned to the Lakers’ struggles and LeBron.
“If you trade LeBron, you’ll never win again,” Shaq said.
After talking to sources, the reality looks more like this: nobody around the league expects the Lakers to trade LeBron.
If we get to August, when LeBron is eligible for a two-year, $97.1 million contract extension, and the Lakers’ roster looks similar to what it does now, then all bets are off.

     LeBron James said he had a “candid” conversation with The Athletic’s Bill Oram on Sunday night after the Lakers’ 123–95 loss to the Pelicans.
James criticized Oram after a report he wrote that James said was not accurate.
“[Oram] and I had a candid conversation after the game tonight and I know he has a job to do,” James said in the tweet.
After Friday’s loss to the Clippers, James addressed the reported tensions between himself and the Lakers by Oram.
“Bill doesn't like the Lakers anyway, so it's always gonna be a negative any time Bill says anything about the Lakers it's gonna be negative so I hope no one in Lakers faithful listen to Bill Oram,” James said.

     Lakers to waive DeAndre Jordan in order to sign DJ Augustin; 76ers interested in adding Jordan, per reports

     The team plans to waive backup big man DeAndre Jordan and sign free agent guard DJ Augustin, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic.
The Lakers also plan to sign forward Wenyen Gabriel to a two-way contract, per Charania.
Jordan appeared in 32 games for the Lakers this season and played 12.8 minutes per performance.
Augustin played in 34 games for the Houston Rockets, but he was waived by the team earlier this month.
Similarly, Jordan will likely be signed elsewhere in order to provide some frontcourt fortification for a team in the playoff hunt.
