     LeBron James after 28-point loss: Lakers had 'no answers' for Pelicans' run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 123-95 loss is the Lakers' fifth in their last six games and the 28-point margin is tied for the second-largest loss this season.
Postgame, Lakers head coach Frank Vogel said the team needed to "flush" this loss and move on.
'No answers," LeBron James said postgame about the Lakers response to the Pelicans' above-mentioned run.
@KingJames (32 PTS, 6 REB, 7 TO) reflects on tonight's loss and looks ahead at the upcoming tough stretch of games.
With this loss, the Lakers slip to 27-33 for the season which slots them at ninth in the West.

     Are the Lakers just committed to being bad the rest of the season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For the umpteenth time this season, the Lakers hit a new low point by being blown out on national television by the Pelicans at home on Sunday.
While it did not reveal anything new about the Lakers, it did seem to cement the fact that this team isn’t interested in actually improving this season.
No matter what the conclusion is, the end result is that the Lakers look destined for a flawed but predictable finish to the season that may not even include the play-in game at this rate.

     Russell Westbrook, the L.A. native whom the franchise completely overhauled its roster to acquire in the offseason, was asked if that type of reception from Lakers fans would be something he takes home with him, after his team lost for the ninth time in its past 12 games.
If they boo, they can take their ass home.
… “I can only answer if I take them home: No.
But as for our team, I don’t think it’s something we got to deal with.
And kind of move forward.”Source: Dave McMenamin @ ESPN

     McCollum, Pelicans roll to 123-95 win over reeling Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NEW ORLEANS — The New Orleans Pelicans are starting to find their stride since acquiring CJ McCollum nearly three weeks ago.
Two nights after a surprising win at Phoenix, the Pelicans rolled to their biggest victory over the reeling Los Angeles Lakers.
McCollum scored 22 points while Jonas Valanciunas and Brandon Ingram added 19 apiece in New Orleans' 123-95 rout Sunday night.
The 28-point margin of victory is the largest in franchise history by the Pelicans over the Lakers, surpassing their 139-117 win in 2018.
McCollum is averaging 28 points in his seven games with the Pelicans since being acquired from Portland on Feb. 8.

     The Los Angeles Lakers were rolled by the New Orleans Pelicans, 123-95, at Crypto.com Arena and on national TV on Sunday night.
It was the Lakers’ fifth loss in six games and their second 25+ point home loss of the season.
Subpar effort has been as detrimental to the 2021-22 Lakers season as injuries.
This is both the Lakers season in a nutshell and its lowest point:pic.twitter.com/T5kq6wFzBb — Michael Corvo (@michaelcorvoNBA) February 28, 2022At the podium afterward, Russell Westbrook acknowledged the inexcusable effort.
“It’s real easy to give up, throw in the towel and say negative things,” said Dwight Howard, who lamented the Lakers effort, as he has repeatedly done this year.

(Mark J. Terrill / Associated Press)AdvertisementObviously, this wasn’t expected for a Lakers team many viewed as a championship contender when the season started.
The Lakers have 22 regular-season games remaining, two of them against this same New Orleans team that just steamrolled Los Angeles.
LeBron James led the Lakers with 32 points on 13-for-23 shooting, but his effort was meaningless in a game the Lakers trailed by as many as 32 points.
