     LeBron James after 28-point loss: Lakers had 'no answers' for Pelicans' run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The 123-95 loss is the Lakers' fifth in their last six games and the 28-point margin is tied for the second-largest loss this season.
Postgame, Lakers head coach Frank Vogel said the team needed to "flush" this loss and move on.
'No answers," LeBron James said postgame about the Lakers response to the Pelicans' above-mentioned run.
@KingJames (32 PTS, 6 REB, 7 TO) reflects on tonight's loss and looks ahead at the upcoming tough stretch of games.
With this loss, the Lakers slip to 27-33 for the season which slots them at ninth in the West.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It adds to what’s been a laughable season from LeBron James and Co.
This isn’t the first time the Lakers have been mocked by basketball fans everywhere.
Fast forward to now, the Lakers are 27-33 and 9th place in the Western Conference standings.
LeBron played a key role in orchestrating the Lakers’ roster moves ahead of the 2021-22 season.
Instead, the Lakers are stuck with the same washed-up lineup that’s limping to the season’s finish line.

     Some executive decided many months ago that we’d watch the Lakers and Nets in primetime this year, and we’d like it, dammit.
And if brighter days await the eighth-place Nets now that Kyrie Irving will soon be unbanned from his own arena, the games have mostly gone the second way for the Lakers.
Sunday night, the Pelicans scored 25 points off 23 Lakers turnovers, seven of them Russell Westbrook’s, seven of them LeBron’s.
is kind of sad, but who can be blamed for disliking the Lakers?
The best of Richard Jefferson's commentary during the Lakers 28-point loss to the Pelicans 😂pic.twitter.com/71awnAswDx — Ballislife.com (@Ballislife) February 28, 2022The Lakers press corps has now spent an alarming portion of players’ recent media availabilities gently asking how it feels to be booed.

That's what it starts with," he said when asked how L.A. can begin to turn things around.
"Try to get off of this slide and get a win, and learn from that win with things you did well, things that you didn't do so well.
"Teams are coming in, playing harder, and I believe that's kind of their scouting report: Just play harder than them and see what happens," Westbrook said.

     LeBron James Rips Heckler During Lakers Game, 'Shut Your Ass Up'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Bron and the Lakers were getting trounced by the Pelicans all Sunday night ... and Laker Nation was audibly disgusted by what they were seeing -- showering the team with boos throughout the game.
James took exception to one particular fan who apparently had some "advice" for the King ... prompting him to clap back as the game was still going on.
The video doesn't show how the fan reacted ... but LeBron went about the rest of his night, finishing with 32 points.
James' relationship with fans has been rocky recently -- remember, he had 2 Pacers fans escorted out for heckling him earlier this season.
The Lakers ended up losing to the Pelicans, 123-95, dropping them to 27-33 on the season with just 22 games remaining.

     LeBron James got into an exchange with a reporter, then followed it up by clearing the air through social media.
LeBron James took to Twitter to clear his name from a recent report.
James claims reporter Bill Oram wrote something that “wasn’t truthful” so the Lakers star felt the need to express that through social media.
🙏🏾✊🏾👑 — LeBron James (@KingJames) February 28, 2022After calling out Bill Oram, LeBron James then tells Lakers fans to “let him be cause he ain’t a bad guy.” It’s a bit of a weird move to tag the reporter to call him out then tell his followers to not harass Oram.
If anyone can do it though, it’s LeBron James.
