     Review: Naomi Watts can’t rescue the listless ‘Infinite Storm’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Naomi Watts in "Infinite Storm."
Bales’s dramatic story has been told before - by Ty Gagne in the New Hampshire Union Leader, and by Bales herself, in an essay in Backpacker magazine - and it is now the basis of a surprisingly quiescent little film called “Infinite Storm” by Polish director Malgorzata Szumowska (”The Other Lamb”).
The real story - and the real, albeit metaphorical - storm of “Infinite Storm” takes place not on Mount Washington, but in the aftermath, in an emotional encounter between Pam and John that never actually took place, but which is fictionalized by Rollins for dramatic effect.
Rather, it delivers a message, as if by snail mail, about something more interior and private.
But that, perplexingly, is what “Infinite Storm” feels like: a harrowing, life-or-death story that has been drained of power to score melodramatic points that feel - however true - unearned.

     We Are Movie Geeks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But she is determined, reminding him it is a special date, an anniversary perhaps, although we sense it is not a happy one.
Thus begins a harrowing true tale of wilderness rescue in a blinding snowstorm, made even more treacherous by the uncooperative, even bizarre, behavior of the man being rescued.
The man being rescued says little, and Billy Howle as that stranger is very, well, strange, as the role demands.
However, that this drama is based on a true story is a fact brings us back from that thought.
The drama has a contemplative message about grief and about how experiences and people can change the direction of one’s life.

     The Infinite Storm Takes Naomi Watts to Her Limits Once More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Infinite Storm, out now in theaters, takes Watts to her limits, once more, this time to the snow-capped peaks of New Hampshire’s White Mountains, where she must confront inner demons and physical challenge to rescue a stranded, injured fellow climber.
While the protagonist’s mental health is no less important than her mountain rescue mission, it’s a good deal less cinematic.
The “infinite” storm, it turns out, was not the one tearing through Mount Washington but Bales’—and her rescuee’s—immeasurable grief.
To say, then, that the film The Infinite Storm doesn’t quite deliver a coherent, effective cinematic narrative is not to demean Bales’ experience by any means.
Nonetheless, any fan of Watts’, any aficionado of mountain-set action-adventure films, or anyone clamoring for more female-helmed, female-driven, female-centric narratives will find The Infinite Storm a gripping tale of trauma and triumph.

     Review: Harrowing Rescue Story Infinite Storm Offers Brutal but Authentic Character Study

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Review: Harrowing Rescue Story Infinite Storm Offers Brutal but Authentic Character StudyOn the heels of what was effectively a one-woman show in the school shooting drama The Desperate Hour, star Naomi Watts returns with another film clearly shot during the pandemic but under wildly different circumstances.
Infinite Storm tells the true story of Pam Bales (Watts), who ascended New Hampshire’s Mt.
As an experienced climber, Bales knew when the best time was to turn around and head home.
Directed by veteran Polish filmmaker Malgorzata Szumowska (Never Gonna Snow Again) and written by Joshua Rollins, Infinite Storm isn’t just a movie about surviving weather and other treacherous climbing conditions.
Infinite Storm is now playing in theaters.
