     Naomi Watts &amp; the Real-Life Inspiration for Her ‘Infinite Storm’ Character, Pam Bales, Discuss the Movie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Infinite Storm tells the real-life story of Pam Bales and her heroic effort to save a hiker from freezing to death in the midst of a storm.
With Naomi Watts in the lead role, the movie is a story of bravery and resilience for Pam and her “John” that she discovers on her hike.
A story about facing the elements and pushing on, Infinite Storm tells us all about the hope that we can give each other.
In preparation for the film’s release, I spoke with actress Naomi Watts, director Małgorzata Szumowska, and Pam Bales herself to discuss the film, and what’s fascinating to me is the inspiration that Watts got from Pam Bales herself in their talks together.
“But in this case, Pam was super available.

They’re only in a market with a new studio wide release, Paramount’s.
And if that film does okay, it’s a good win for everyone, a Specialty Distribution executive said, as it appeals to an older and female demo that has been hard to win back in theaters.
They’ve got the point that the Omicron version of the movie won’t make a new dent in the very slowly reviving market for non-superhero movies.

     Infinite Storm Suffers From an Identity Crisis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Infinite Storm, the latest entry in this subgenre, at first attempts to continue in that tradition.
A man at a camping lodge (Denis O’Hare) hassles Pam because a storm might be brewing.
Infinite Storm follows Pam rescuing John, which would be arduous enough on its own, but is made worse by his stubborn unwillingness to cooperate.
Infinite Storm suffers from an identity crisis: it wants to be a survival thriller, and a feel-good drama about one woman’s newfound calling at middle age.
Ironically, Pam’s purpose on the mountain was always clear to her, and Szumowska distorts her single-mindedness until the film suffers along with it.

     Review: Naomi Watts can’t rescue the listless ‘Infinite Storm’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Naomi Watts in "Infinite Storm."
Bales’s dramatic story has been told before - by Ty Gagne in the New Hampshire Union Leader, and by Bales herself, in an essay in Backpacker magazine - and it is now the basis of a surprisingly quiescent little film called “Infinite Storm” by Polish director Malgorzata Szumowska (”The Other Lamb”).
The real story - and the real, albeit metaphorical - storm of “Infinite Storm” takes place not on Mount Washington, but in the aftermath, in an emotional encounter between Pam and John that never actually took place, but which is fictionalized by Rollins for dramatic effect.
Rather, it delivers a message, as if by snail mail, about something more interior and private.
But that, perplexingly, is what “Infinite Storm” feels like: a harrowing, life-or-death story that has been drained of power to score melodramatic points that feel - however true - unearned.

     ‘Infinite Storm’ Review: Naomi Watts Chills In This Wintry Survival Drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the past month, we’ve been offered five of them from various distributors, including Hulu‘s “No Exit,” Netflix’s “Against the Ice,” and now, the nearly-silent thriller “Infinite Storm” from Bleecker Street.
You’ll spend the first hour of “Infinite Storm” glued to the screen, swept up in a gale of winds, howls, and trumpeting skies.
And yet, as capable as “Infinite Storm” is for much of the picture, it starts to lose its grip in the last act.
Perhaps it would’ve been better had it taken place entirely in the alps, but when “Infinite Storm” makes its way back to civilization, it all goes off the rails.
She’s spent a lifetime training to live beyond her personal demons, and ultimately “Infinite Storm” doesn’t afford her the quiet dignity of resolve this character seems to have relished all along.

     The Infinite Storm Takes Naomi Watts to Her Limits Once More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Infinite Storm, out now in theaters, takes Watts to her limits, once more, this time to the snow-capped peaks of New Hampshire’s White Mountains, where she must confront inner demons and physical challenge to rescue a stranded, injured fellow climber.
While the protagonist’s mental health is no less important than her mountain rescue mission, it’s a good deal less cinematic.
The “infinite” storm, it turns out, was not the one tearing through Mount Washington but Bales’—and her rescuee’s—immeasurable grief.
To say, then, that the film The Infinite Storm doesn’t quite deliver a coherent, effective cinematic narrative is not to demean Bales’ experience by any means.
Nonetheless, any fan of Watts’, any aficionado of mountain-set action-adventure films, or anyone clamoring for more female-helmed, female-driven, female-centric narratives will find The Infinite Storm a gripping tale of trauma and triumph.

     Summary: Review: Harrowing Rescue Story Infinite Storm Offers Brutal but Authentic Character StudyOn the heels of what was effectively a one-woman show in the school shooting drama The Desperate Hour, star Naomi Watts returns with another film clearly shot during the pandemic but under wildly different circumstances.
Infinite Storm tells the true story of Pam Bales (Watts), who ascended New Hampshire’s Mt.
As an experienced climber, Bales knew when the best time was to turn around and head home.
Directed by veteran Polish filmmaker Malgorzata Szumowska (Never Gonna Snow Again) and written by Joshua Rollins, Infinite Storm isn’t just a movie about surviving weather and other treacherous climbing conditions.
Infinite Storm is now playing in theaters.
