     Summary: I love you,” she wrote alongside a photo of a masked Teresa in a hospital bed.
Even placing 3rd in her very first ever body competition that was well-documented on RHONJ.
Teresa did share on Instagram that she had a procedure performed on her legs to reduce the appearance of varicose veins in February, saying “My legs look and feel great.”Let’s hope this is not from a complication from that procedure.
Whatever the case, we’re happy to hear that our RHONJ OG was able to get the medical attention she needed and is ready to get back home.
Sending good positive and healing thoughts to Teresa and her family.
