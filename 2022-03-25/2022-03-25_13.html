    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Igor Konashenkov claimed Friday that Russian forces destroyed "the largest of the remaining fuel depots" near Kyiv, with a strike carried out with sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles.
"On the evening of March 24, a strike was carried out with sea-launched Kalibr precision cruise missiles on a fuel base in Kalynovka, outside Kyiv," Konashenkov claimed.
"The largest of the remaining fuel depot of the Ukrainian armed forces, which supplied fuel to military units in the central part of the country, was destroyed," Konashenkov added.

     Saudi Arabia: Houthis strike Jeddah oil depot ahead of F1 race weekend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yemen's Houthi rebels struck an oil depot in the Saudi city of Jeddah on Friday in a missile attack that caused a large fire and left clouds of black smoke hanging over the port city.
The Yemeni group acknowledged they had launched a series of attacks on the kingdom ahead of the F1 Grand Prix race scheduled to take place there.
Saudi Arabia and the state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco did not immediately acknowledge the blaze, though it appeared to be on the same fuel depot that the Houthis attacked in recent days.
The Saudi-led coalition early Saturday launched air strikes "against sources of threat in Sanaa and Hodeida" following the Jeddah attack, the official Saudi news agency SPA tweeted.
The North Jeddah Bulk Plant stores diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel for use in Jeddah, the kingdom's second-largest city.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Saudi Arabia and state-run Saudi Aramco did not immediately acknowledge the blaze, it appeared to be centred on a fuel depot that the Houthis have previously targeted.
The attacks targeted “Aramco facilities in Jeddah and vital facilities in the capital of the Saudi enemy, Riyadh”, tweeted Saree.
Following the Jeddah attack, people on the F1 track could see the large black smoke cloud in the distance.
Saudi state television acknowledged attacks in the town of Dhahran that hit water tanks and damaged vehicles and houses.
Another attack targeted an electrical substation in an area of southwestern Saudi Arabia near the Yemeni border, state TV said.

     Summary: Home Depot (HD) became the new leader through the end of February thanks to a surge of $140,000 last month alone.
(REUTERS/Mike Blake)Still, it appears that Home Depot's contributions to election objectors jumped in recent years.
“What was it, a grandstand play?”Continued focus on the issueAn ever-evolving landscape of companies have been named the top political donor to the 147 election objectors.
In one notable example, Toyota (TM) made headlines for continuing donations to election objectors early on before abruptly announcing last July it was stopping the practice.
Despite reluctance of companies like Toyota to continue donating to those Republicans, OpenSecrets recently found election objectors are among the top fundraisers among Republicans heading into mid-terms.
