     Teresa Giudice of ‘RHONJ’ recovering after emergency operation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Real Housewives of New Jersey” mainstay Teresa Giudice is on the mend after an emergency hospital procedure this week.
The reality star’s lawyer, James Leonard, told the outlet she was admitted to a hospital Wednesday and had a “non-cosmetic” operation Thursday.
As Page Six noted, Giudice’s eldest daughter, Rutgers student Gia, 21, asked for prayers on Instagram in connection with the emergency procedure, sharing a photo of her mother in a hospital gown.
(Earlier this month, Giudice told “Watch What Happens Live” host Andy Cohen, a “RHONJ” producer, that her fellow cast member and sister-in-law, Melissa Gorga, would not be a bridesmaid.)
The “RHONJ” personality divorced ex-husband Joe Giudice in 2020 following his deportation to Italy.
