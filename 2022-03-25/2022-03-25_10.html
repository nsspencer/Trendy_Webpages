     How to fix the ‘Connection Lost’ error in Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands￼
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Launch days for most games that feature online elements tend to involve at least a few issues, specifically when it comes to multiplayer and online connectivity.
This has proven true for Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, as players attempting to enjoy their time with the Borderlands spinoff have encountered several problems.
The most common issue players have experienced is a “Connection Lost” error message that pops up and notifies them that their online session is likely experiencing at least a few problems.
This error specifically ties into SHiFT, which is a program developed by Gearbox Software that rewards fans with additional in-game content through the use of code and item redemption.
Unfortunately, outside of checking your own internet connection and restarting the game, you likely won’t be able to fix the Connection Lost error if it specifically deals with SHiFT.

     Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands: Every Class Ranked Worst to Best
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are better melee options, there are better spell options, and there are better companion options.
Graveborn – A Powerful Spell Slinging Class That Can be Tricky To Learn and MasterAs the name suggests, the Graveborn class often dances between life and death.
The biggest “problem” with the Graveborn class is that their natural style of play requires them to constantly lose health.
Every class suffers from bad decision-making, but no other class punishes bad play as obviously or as often as the Graveborn does.
Stabbomancer – A Stealth Class That Packs a Surprising PunchIf you’re looking at Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands like it’s a D&amp;D game, then it’s best to think of Stabbomancers as Rogues.

     Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands: How the New Character Creator Works
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unlike the Borderlands games before it, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands includes a full-on character creator, not just swappable head and body skins.
With that in mind, let’s jump into the basics of Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands’ Character Creator and how it works, if you’re wondering just how creative, or weird, you can get.
Every IGN Borderlands Review 29 ImagesTiny Tina’s Wonderlands features six character classes: Stabbomancer, Clawbringer, Spellshot, Graveborn, Spore Warden, and Brr-Zerker.
And that’s our quick breakdown on the character creator in Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands.

     A Few Hours In, I Can Tell Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands Will Destroy My Free Time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The best thing I can say about Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is that I regret starting it.
Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands scratches the “numbers go up and enemy health bars go down” itch video games have instilled in so many of us.
Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, out today for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, is a fantasy-inspired spinoff of Borderlands that bucks (some of) those expectations.
But Wonderlands quickly tees up a bunch of features that haven’t been present in any previous Borderlands game.
But for now, I’m happy to report that Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is some solid, mindless fun, the sort of thing that’s bound to devour every second of my free time in the coming weeks.

     The best Tiny Tina's Wonderlands builds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tiny Tina's Wonderlands build system will be pretty familiar to anyone who's played the numbered Borderlands entries in the past.
The biggest change this time around is the "multi-class" function, allowing you to mix and match the abilities of one additional Tiny Tina's Wonderlands class with your main one.
With that in mind, let's go over some of the best builds in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, followed by some multi-class suggestions.
The latter increases spell damage at the cost of your ward's automatic regeneration, while Mage Armor regenerates your ward on casting a spell.
Two main paths presented to the Clawbringer are focusing on guns and fire elemental damage, or melee and lightning damage.
