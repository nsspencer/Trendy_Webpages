     NFL rumors: Buccaneers’ Tom Brady orchestrating trade back to AFC East?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Tom Brady ended his short-lived retirement last month, the assumption was he would return as quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, since, you know, he’s under contract with them.
And while Brady has been busy recruiting free agents to Tampa Bay, there’s a new plot that’s beginning to take shape.
NESN and WEEI broadcaster Dale Arnold reports he “Would not be surprised if @TomBrady didn’t play for @Buccaneers next season.
However The Athletic’s Jeff Howe reports “There’s nothing happening between Tom Brady and the Dolphins, according to a source.
But the plan may not have been for Brady to play quarterback.

     Tom Brady ‘Working On’ Bucs Trade to Dolphins?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The story has been debunked by national media people, but it’s original source is legit enough to bear repeating …Tom Brady wants to be traded to the Miami Dolphins?!
It has been two weeks since the “retired” Brady announced that he was coming out of retirement to return to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
And we know he’s been busy trying to recruit even more talent to the Tampa Bay roster than won a Super Bowl two years ago.
A report surfaced on Thursday that the legendary quarterback and the Dolphins were working on a deal to move the seven-time Super Bowl champion to Miami.
But that’s different than the idea not being the subject of exploration on the part of the “loading-up” Dolphins and the ring-seeking Brady.

     The Tom Brady-Miami Dolphins Chatter: Why It's Come Up, Why It's Highly Unlikely
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arnold then doubled down on it through Boston radio show Merloni &amp; Fauria, stating that the parties were "working on it."
The radio show also suggested it was Arnold who first broke the story of Brady signing with the Buccaneers in the first place in 2020.
Jeff Howe, who covers the Patriots for The Athletic, has suggested there is nothing to the chatter about a trade being in the works to send Brady to Miami.
But that conversation again will become moot if Tagovailoa emerges as a bona fide franchise quarterback in 2022.
Brady, meanwhile, likely will be trying for a second Super Bowl title in three years with Tampa Bay, barring an unforeseen turn of events.

     Tom Brady let out the secret of his NFL return to this small group just before he announced it to the world
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Tom Brady shockingly announced that he was coming out of retirement on March 13, there was a small group of people who weren't so shocked by the news and that's because Brady had actually tipped them off beforehand.
Brady sent shockwaves through the NFL less than two weeks ago when he sent out a tweet at 7:13 p.m. that declared that he would be returning to football.
Although there was speculation for weeks that Brady might return, it appears he didn't actually settle on his decision to come back until the day he announced it.
The text hit Godwin's phone about 30 minutes before the quarterback announced his return to the rest of the world.
Brady is on a text thread with both Godwin and Mike Evans and he had sent the message to both players.

     No, Tom Brady is not going to the Dolphins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He was one of the earliest to say that Brady would be signing with the Bucs back in 2020.
Unfinished business LFG pic.twitter.com/U0yhRKVKVm — Tom Brady (@TomBrady) March 13, 2022Second, the weapons being built in Miami still pale in comparison to those in Tampa.
He’s even recruiting other players to come join him in Tampa;There’s nothing happening between Tom Brady and the Dolphins, according to a source.
All of this stemmed from an earlier rumor that Brady was going to attempt to purchase an ownership share in the Dolphins following his retirement.
In all honesty, if Brady truly was going to buy a stake in the Dolphins franchise it most likely would have been the ultimate troll move.

     Are the Bucs really trading Tom Brady to the Dolphins?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementKeep in mind, Arnold was the first person to break Tom Brady’s decision to join Tampa Bay two seasons ago.
Perhaps that is why Brady has sudden interest in the Dolphins, if what Arnold says is true.
They now have one of the best wide receiver corps in the league, and Hill would arguably be the most explosive receiver Brady has worked with since Randy Moss.
That being said, if Brady wants out of Tampa, it makes sense that Miami would be his preferred destination.
That being said, it would undoubtedly be the biggest sports story in America — the third one involving Brady this month.
