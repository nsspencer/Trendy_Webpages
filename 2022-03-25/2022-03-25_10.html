“Congressman Fortenberry must resign from the House.”AdvertisementHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) skirted repeated questions about whether Fortenberry should immediately resign, saying he wanted to talk to him first before publicly expressing his opinion on the case.
The billionaire was accused of making illegal contributions totaling $180,000 to four U.S. political candidates.
According to the indictment, Fortenberry “knowingly and willfully made materially false statements and representations to the FBI and IRS” about the illegal donations.
Outside the courtroom, Fortenberry read a text from one of his daughters, who he said was away at college.

     Nebraska Rep. Jeff Fortenberry is found guilty in contributions probe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES — U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska was convicted Thursday on charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign from a foreign billionaire at a 2016 Los Angeles fundraiser.
Outside the courthouse, Fortenberry said the process had been unfair and he would appeal immediately.
Fortenberry took a big political hit when prosecutors announced the charges, and his indictment already divided Nebraska Republicans who backed him for years in the conservative district.
Defense lawyers said Fortenberry's flaw was voluntarily meeting with agents and prosecutors to help their probe and having a faulty memory.
Fortenberry asked Ayoub on the phone call to organize another fundraiser with supporters of their cause.
