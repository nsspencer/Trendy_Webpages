     Doja Cat says she's quitting music: "Y’all take care"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last night, after engaging in an online fight with fans from Paraguay, rapper Doja Cat tweeted that she is quitting music.
When fans allegedly began to flock around her hotel, looking to take photos with the rapper, she never showed.
Fans seemed particularly angered with Doja for not tweeting or posting any photos from her time in Paraguay (as if that’s a thing she’s obligated to do).
This isn’t the first time the artist has found herself frustrated with the expectations of fame, particularly when it comes to taking photos.
I wanna make music.

     Doja Cat tells fans she’s walking away from music: “I quit” – 97.9 WRMF
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doja Cat told fans she is quitting music after a particularly nasty Twitter row with her South American fans.
Fans from Paraguay claim the “Kiss Me More” singer ignored them while she was in the nation’s capital to perform at a music festival, which was later canceled due to inclement weather.
The Twitter thread claims Doja only spoke about the festival to complain fans weren’t waiting for her outside her hotel when she left to go to Brazil.
Y’all take care.” Doja has since changed her Twitter handle to “i quit” and put “lol” in her bio.
It’s unknown if Doja is serious about leaving music, but several artists have reacted to the news — most notably rapper ﻿Kodak Black﻿, who remarked, “Doja Cat Bet Not Quit Musik B4 We Do A Song Together.”Copyright © 2022, ABC Audio.
