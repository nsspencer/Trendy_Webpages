     Airline CEOs demand end to mask mandate, send letter to President Biden
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HARLINGEN — The chief executives of 10 major airlines and cargo haulers sent a letter to President Joe Biden demanding an end to mask mandates and pre-flight testing for international travelers.
The letter was passed to the White House through the advocacy group Airlines for America, and was signed by the CEOs of American Airlines, United Airlines Holdings, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines.
Others include the leaders of UPS Airlines, FedEx Express, JetBlue Airways, Alaska Air Group and Atlas Air Worldwide.
It was the fourth extension of the mandate since February 2021.
Last month, Texas Attorney Gen. Ken Paxton filed suit against the Biden administration seeking to rescind mask mandates for airports, airlines and all public transportation networks.

     Three Hawaii Airlines At Forefront: Ending Airline Mask Mandate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The CEOs of all three of Hawaii’s major airlines, and other airlines, have penned a letter to President Biden requesting that the federal transportation mask mandate be dropped.
The letter was published by the industry advocacy group, Airlines For America.
They added, “Given that we have entered a different phase of dealing with this virus, we strongly support your view that ‘COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.”Presently, the mask mandate imposed by the federal government is set to expire on April 18.
A wide range of travel advocacy groups are also lobbying for the elimination of masks.
How do you feel about the prospect of the mask mandate for Hawaii flights ending?

     US airline CEOs call on President Biden to end the federal mask mandate on planes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A group of CEOs from all major airlines in the U.S. is calling on President Biden to drop the federal transportation mask mandate along with the international pre-departure COVID-19 testing requirement.
The group argues that the increase in vaccinations nationwide and the lifting of restrictions in other countries are reasons the Biden administration should reconsider its COVID policies for travelers.
“We are encouraged by the current data and the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions from coast to coast, which indicate it is past time to eliminate COVID-era transportation policies,” the group said.
The CEOs emphasized that, while they’ve supported and cooperated with the federal government’s COVID policies, including masking and pre-departure testing, enforcing those rules has fallen to airline employees for the past two years.
The mandate for mask use on public transportation and in transportation hubs had been set to expire on March 18, but earlier this month the Transportation Security Administration extended the policy through April 18.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (NewsNation) — Since the pandemic started, one of the unchanging factors of the situation has been the mask mandates on airplanes, established by the FAA.
Now, several airline CEOs are sending the Biden administration a letter asking it to end the mask mandate and the COVID-19 testing requirement for those entering the United States.
No one’s not flying or flying because they can or cannot wear a mask.
Several other countries like Canada, the U.K. and other European countries have already dropped mask mandates.
Currently, mask mandates on public transportation are set to expire on April 18.
