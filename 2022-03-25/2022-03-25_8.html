    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kansas’ 66-61 victory over Providence on Friday at the United Center not only vaulted the Jayhawks into the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight, but also gave KU’s program the most wins in college basketball history.
After the win, KU has 2,354 victories against 877 losses.
Kentucky, which lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Saint Peter’s, is 2,353-720.
A Kentucky reporter asked KU coach Bill Self on Tuesday during Self’s first pre-Sweet 16 news conference of the week about the significance of passing Kentucky on the all-time win list on Friday.
“Even if we were good that game, I’m not sure our good would have been good enough to beat their great that game.

     Summary: CHICAGO — Kansas men’s basketball coach Bill Self again downplayed the significance this week of the Jayhawks potentially passing the Kentucky Wildcats for the lead in all-time victories.

In the second half, Martin didn’t hit as many shots from the field but still finished with a team-high 23 points.
As a team, the Jayhawks finished shooting 39.3% from the field, 14.3% from behind the arc and 71.4% from the free-throw line.
Kansas just didn’t do enough to take advantage of Providence shooting 33.8% from the field, 17.4% from behind the arc and 68.8% from the free-throw line.

     Summary: CHICAGO -- As Kansas prepared to face Providence in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament, Jayhawks coach Bill Self reluctantly acknowledged his team's improvement on defense.
Self was a bit giddier after Kansas' defense propelled it to a 66-61 win over Providence at the United Center.
Kansas, which passed Kentucky and become college basketball's all-time winningest program with its 2,354th victory, is the only No.
Wilson (16 points) and Remy Martin (season-high 23 points) were the only Kansas players to score in double figures.
Self wasn't as pleased with Kansas' defense in the second half, as Providence scored 44 points on 48.5% shooting.

     Summary: Remy Martin scored a game-high 23 for Kansas, while Wilson had 16 points and 11 rebounds.
Here are a few takeaways from Kansas' win in the Sweet 16 on Friday.
Providence shot just 20% from the floor and the Friars had as many shots blocked (seven) as they made.
When Kansas went on its own rough offensive run, Providence bullied inside with Ed Croswell and hit from the outside with Horschler.
While Providence didn't quite have enough firepower to finish the job, the Friars acquitted themselves well.
