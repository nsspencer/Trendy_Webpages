     Solomon Islands’ Ties With China Challenge Western Dominance of Pacific
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SYDNEY—When the U.S. last month said it would open an embassy in the Solomon Islands, it aimed to demonstrate its renewed engagement in the Pacific region.
Behind the scenes, however, Solomon Islands officials were courting another big power: China.
A virtual meeting last week concluded with the Solomon Islands and China signing an agreement to work together on law enforcement, around three months after Beijing offered nonlethal equipment and to train local police in the wake of violent protests.

     Summary: Document indicates China could boost military in SolomonsEnlarge this image toggle caption Thomas Peter/AP Thomas Peter/APWELLINGTON, New Zealand — A leaked document indicates that China could boost its military presence in the Solomon Islands — including with ship visits — in a development that is raising alarm in nearby Australia and beyond.
The Solomon Islands revealed on Thursday it had signed a policing cooperation agreement with China.
Under the terms of the draft agreement, China could send police, military personnel, and other armed forces to the Solomons "to assist in maintaining social order" and for a variety of other reasons.
New Zealand said it planned to raise its concerns about the document with both the Solomon Islands and China.
Veke, meanwhile, said the Solomon Islands government attached great importance to its relationship with China.

     Solomon Islands confirms proposed security deal with China
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Australia and New Zealand expressed concern on Friday about the impact on regional security of military cooperation between China and the Solomon Islands after a draft document outlining proposed cooperation was leaked.
The proposed security arrangements with China would cover humanitarian needs besides maintaining the rule of law, it added.
A security agreement with Australia, signed in 2017, would be preserved as Solomon Islands deepened relations with China, it said.
Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he had not spoken to his Solomon Islands counterpart in the 24 hours since news of the Pacific island’s security discussions with China were made public.
Australia and New Zealand were part of the “Pacific family” and talks were being held with Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, Morrison told reporters earlier Friday.

     Chinese draft security deal with Solomon Islands didn’t blindside Australia, Morrison says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Scott Morrison says Australia was not blindsided by a draft security deal between China and Solomon Islands, which experts warn has demonstrated a “black and white” intent at expanding influence in the Pacific.
Solomon Islands switched diplomatic ties from Taiwan to Beijing in 2019, which partly fuelled discontent that led to riots in the capital, Honiara.
Morrison noted Australia had negotiated a bilateral security deal with Solomon Islands in 2017, and is always the “first call” when a crisis arises.
Asked about the prospect of a Chinese naval base so close to Australia, Morrison replied that Australia wanted “a free and open Indo-Pacific”.
In a significant signal, the government statement referred at one point to Australia and China as “Solomon Islands two major partners”.
