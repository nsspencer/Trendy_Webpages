     ‘Great concern’ over China-Solomon Islands deal: Australia PM
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Reuters) – Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday there was “great concern” across the Pacific after Solomon Islands confirmed it was creating a security partnership with China.
Morrison said Sogavare on Friday indicated to Canberra that he appreciated Australia’s ongoing support for Solomon Islands.
“We are the Solomon Islands’ single largest development partner, daylight second, third, fourth,” Morrison said.
Australia has previously expressed concern about the impact on regional security of military cooperation between China and Solomon Islands after a draft document outlining the proposed cooperation was leaked this week.
On Thursday, a Solomon Islands official told Reuters a security deal with China covering the military would be sent to its cabinet for consideration.

     Solomon Islands confirms proposed security deal with China
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Australia and New Zealand expressed concern on Friday about the impact on regional security of military cooperation between China and the Solomon Islands after a draft document outlining proposed cooperation was leaked.
The proposed security arrangements with China would cover humanitarian needs besides maintaining the rule of law, it added.
A security agreement with Australia, signed in 2017, would be preserved as Solomon Islands deepened relations with China, it said.
Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he had not spoken to his Solomon Islands counterpart in the 24 hours since news of the Pacific island’s security discussions with China were made public.
Australia and New Zealand were part of the “Pacific family” and talks were being held with Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, Morrison told reporters earlier Friday.

     A security agreement between China and Solomon Islands could impact stability in the whole Pacific | Mihai Sora
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A leaked draft security agreement being negotiated between China and Solomon Islands could have security implications for the whole Pacific.
The agreement also allows China, with the consent of Solomon Islands, to make ship visits, provide logistical support and have stopovers and transition in Solomon Islands.
Pacific Islands Forum members, including Australia, agreed in the 2018 Boe Declaration to address regional security challenges collectively.
Solomon Islands’ increasingly close ties with China since the switch of diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2019 remains a highly sensitive issue domestically.
Opposition politicians questioned how far Chinese security cooperation with Solomon Islands would go.

     Solomon Islands drafts military agreement with China, defying US-Australian threats
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Australian political and foreign policy establishment met with uproar a leaked draft memorandum of understanding on military cooperation between Solomon Islands and China.
Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare (Photo: solomons.gov.sb)China last month donated police equipment and has sent six police trainers to work with Solomon Islands’ officers.
The draft “framework agreement” on “security cooperation” includes clauses potentially giving the Chinese military wide scope to operate within Solomon Islands.
The prospect of a Solomons-China military agreement has exposed the “democratic” and “humanitarian” façade of US and Australian imperialist policy in the South Pacific.
Canberra will no doubt do everything it can to sabotage the Solomons-China military agreement before it is finalised, including by working to destabilise and remove the Sogavare government.

     Summary: SYDNEY—When the U.S. last month said it would open an embassy in the Solomon Islands, it aimed to demonstrate its renewed engagement in the Pacific region.
Behind the scenes, however, Solomon Islands officials were courting another big power: China.
The national flags of the Solomon Islands and China in Tiananmen Square in Beijing; China is tightening its relationship with the island nation.
“That includes in the Pacific islands, because what happens here matters to the U.S.,” he said.
In 2018, Australia pressured the Solomon Islands to drop China’s Huawei Technologies Co. from a project to build an undersea high-speed internet cable.
