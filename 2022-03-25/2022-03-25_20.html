     Johnny Depp loses court ruling over Amber Heard libel defence plan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Depp sued Heard for libel in Virginia after the Washington Post published her opinion piece.
Depp’s lawyers say the article falsely implies she was physically and sexually abused by Depp when the actors were married.
Heard has also filed a counterclaim for defamation against Depp because of statements Depp‘s lawyer made about her.
Both Depp and Heard are scheduled to testify in court, with numerous other Hollywood figures listed as potential witnesses.
While the December 2018 Post article never mentions Depp, Heard refers to herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse”.

     What the Johnny Depp v. Amber Heard case could mean for survivors who speak out in media
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A court case between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard will commence on April 11 in Virginia.
Both Depp and Heard have made serious accusations against each other about domestic abuse, and this is not the first court case about how their relationship has played out in the media.
In November 2020, Depp lost a libel case in the United Kingdom against The Sun, which wrote that he was a “wife beater” (Heard testified in this case).
Besides making headlines on entertainment sites, will this defamation case set any precedents for people who write about surviving domestic violence and their alleged perpetrators?
Nicole Froio, a feminist researcher and journalist, is concerned that if Depp’s defamation suit is successful, it could lead to some perpetrators of domestic violence trying to silence survivors.

     Summary: This latest ruling by Virginia Judge Penney Azcarate dealt with the concept of SLAPP suits.
RELATED: Johnny Depp's U.S.
The judge there ruled that "wife-beater" was a "substantially true" description of Depp, with the judge believing Heard's side of events.
His case got harder, though, with Heard now possibly being able to use an anti-SLAPP suit defense against Depp.
