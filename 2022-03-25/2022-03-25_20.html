     Summary: A24’s SXSW Opener everywhere togetherbleaker streets infinite storm and Sony Pictures Classics’ mothering Sunday Offer something that has been a rarity of late at the exclusive box office, fresh content and the like.
They’re only in a market with a new studio wide release, Paramount’s.
And if that film does okay, it’s a good win for everyone, a Specialty Distribution executive said, as it appeals to an older and female demo that has been hard to win back in theaters.
They’ve got the point that the Omicron version of the movie won’t make a new dent in the very slowly reviving market for non-superhero movies.
He and others have noted week after week that there really is no specific recovery possible…

     Naomi Watts Is Stoic and Indestructible in Epic Adventure ‘Infinite Storm’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Another true-life story about surviving the elements, Infinite Storm adds nothing new to the genre, but it is well-photographed, the epic adventure is harrowing, and Naomi Watts earns more deserved applause for being one of the gamest actors in films today.
INFINITE STORM ★★★(3/4 stars)Directed by: Małgorzata SzumowskaWritten by: Joshua RollinsStarring: Naomi Watts, Denis O’Hare, Billy HowleRunning time: 1 hour 38 mins.
1:02 p.m. looks like midnight, so she heads back on a six-mile hike down the mountain praying for survival.
Washington, but the movie is chock full of enough hair-raising moments to make the viewer wonder how survival can ever be possible.
(Or one movie’s success, as Naomi Watts’ bravura performance proves.)

     Naomi Watts &amp; the Real-Life Inspiration for Her ‘Infinite Storm’ Character, Pam Bales, Discuss the Movie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Infinite Storm tells the real-life story of Pam Bales and her heroic effort to save a hiker from freezing to death in the midst of a storm.
With Naomi Watts in the lead role, the movie is a story of bravery and resilience for Pam and her “John” that she discovers on her hike.
A story about facing the elements and pushing on, Infinite Storm tells us all about the hope that we can give each other.
In preparation for the film’s release, I spoke with actress Naomi Watts, director Małgorzata Szumowska, and Pam Bales herself to discuss the film, and what’s fascinating to me is the inspiration that Watts got from Pam Bales herself in their talks together.
“But in this case, Pam was super available.

     Infinite Storm Suffers From an Identity Crisis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Infinite Storm, the latest entry in this subgenre, at first attempts to continue in that tradition.
A man at a camping lodge (Denis O’Hare) hassles Pam because a storm might be brewing.
Infinite Storm follows Pam rescuing John, which would be arduous enough on its own, but is made worse by his stubborn unwillingness to cooperate.
Infinite Storm suffers from an identity crisis: it wants to be a survival thriller, and a feel-good drama about one woman’s newfound calling at middle age.
Ironically, Pam’s purpose on the mountain was always clear to her, and Szumowska distorts her single-mindedness until the film suffers along with it.

     ‘Infinite Storm’: How a mountain rescue became a film

     Summary: “Infinite Storm,” a new film, recounts how Pam Bales saved the life of a man she found atop Mount Washington in New Hampshire in 2010.
Screenwriter Joshua Rollins first read about the harrowing rescue in an article by journalist Ty Gagne.
Why We Wrote This Joshua Rollins, screenwriter for the new film “Infinite Storm,” discusses the humanity and humility behind real-life rescuer Pam Bales’ heroic actions.
Staff writer Stephen Humphries recently spoke by phone with screenwriter Joshua Rollins (whose wife, Amanda Paulson, was formerly a Monitor journalist).
Courtesy of Joshua Rollins Joshua Rollins' script for "Infinite Storm" was influenced by interviews with hiker Pam Bales and the philosophy of naturalist John Muir.

     The Infinite Storm Takes Naomi Watts to Her Limits Once More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Infinite Storm, out now in theaters, takes Watts to her limits, once more, this time to the snow-capped peaks of New Hampshire’s White Mountains, where she must confront inner demons and physical challenge to rescue a stranded, injured fellow climber.
While the protagonist’s mental health is no less important than her mountain rescue mission, it’s a good deal less cinematic.
The “infinite” storm, it turns out, was not the one tearing through Mount Washington but Bales’—and her rescuee’s—immeasurable grief.
To say, then, that the film The Infinite Storm doesn’t quite deliver a coherent, effective cinematic narrative is not to demean Bales’ experience by any means.
Nonetheless, any fan of Watts’, any aficionado of mountain-set action-adventure films, or anyone clamoring for more female-helmed, female-driven, female-centric narratives will find The Infinite Storm a gripping tale of trauma and triumph.

     Summary: Review: Harrowing Rescue Story Infinite Storm Offers Brutal but Authentic Character StudyOn the heels of what was effectively a one-woman show in the school shooting drama The Desperate Hour, star Naomi Watts returns with another film clearly shot during the pandemic but under wildly different circumstances.
Infinite Storm tells the true story of Pam Bales (Watts), who ascended New Hampshire’s Mt.
As an experienced climber, Bales knew when the best time was to turn around and head home.
Directed by veteran Polish filmmaker Malgorzata Szumowska (Never Gonna Snow Again) and written by Joshua Rollins, Infinite Storm isn’t just a movie about surviving weather and other treacherous climbing conditions.
Infinite Storm is now playing in theaters.
