     Utah legislature overrides Governor Spencer Cox's veto to ban transgender athletes from girls sports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Members of Utah's House and Senate have voted to override Governor Spencer Cox's veto of a controversial bill that bans transgender student athletes from participating in girls sports.
The bill, titled HB11, has been framed as a protection of women's sports, but critics have called it an "attack" on transgender children.
On Monday, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb also vetoed a bill banning transgender athletes from choosing their own sports teams, saying he found no evidence of unfairness.
But critics maintain bills like HB11 unfairly target transgender children under the guise that they make the playing field uneven.
"Despite opposition from their own governor, Utah legislators continue to attack transgender children," the Human Rights Campaign said in a statement Friday.
