‘Pachinko’ begins in 1910s Korea Juhan Noh Minha Kim, who plays the young Sunja in Pachinko Juhan NohFilming took place in both Vancouver and Korea.
If you travel down to this village from Seoul, you really get to see this period of time preserved.
That was certainly my favorite location, and really one of my favorite sets.

     Apple TV’s Pachinko is an enthralling historical epic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The nonlinear construction of time in the Pachinko series marks a significant departure from Lee’s novel, which progresses chronologically, turning this adaptation into a radically different project.
One episode towards the later part of the series also takes a historical detour that feels particularly disjointed with the rest of the story.
He is unfazed by the “one landowner hold[ing] the entire deal hostage” — an elderly zainichi Korean lady, Grandmother Han.
In many ways, the enormity of the Pachinko series extends far beyond the small screens we watch it on.
In Pachinko, Apple has woven together an extraordinary project that will hopefully herald many more to come.

     The Story of ‘Pachinko’ Can’t Be Contained by Time or Space
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new Apple TV+ series spans multiple continents and timelines but focuses its impressive scope on an intimate story.
Usually epic stories need to involve a dragon of some kind, or at least a healthy amount of fantastic CGI.
But “Pachinko,” the new Apple TV+ series created by Soo Hugh and directed by Kogonada and Justin Chon, sets out to be an epic about ordinary human stories.
Hoffmeister credited shooting in Large Format digital with accentuating a strong sense of space within individual frames.
And it was really powerful to see.”Sign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

     ‘Pachinko,’ an epic of multigenerational loss, is hard to get lost in
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They and their descendants constitute the Zainichi, many of whom have faced lifelong discrimination that continues top this day.
The Korean Japanese dominate the pachinko industry, based on the popular manic pinball game with a proximity to gambling that has garnered parlor owners a seedy reputation.
“Pachinko” is a tale of movement and privation, of people so busy surviving that it isn’t until years later that they can fully process all they’ve lost.
Here’s where I’ll happily confess that “Pachinko” is one of my favorite novels of the past decade.
As is now de rigueur for biopics — but not period dramas — an epilogue showcases interviews with real-life Zainichi women who reflect on their own experiences.

     Pachinko review: Apple TV’s heartfelt new series is a singular epic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet, Apple TV Plus’ newest drama, Pachinko, manages to take all of these tropes and refine them into something beautifully specific and new: a Korean family epic.
Pachinko doesn’t fit into one genre box because it escapes the trappings of traditional historical fiction (see: Downton Abbey’s penchant for style over substance).
And he will be loved.” Men may have put her in this position, but she will find a way out; Sunja doesn’t need saving from her misfortune.
Solomon does go through his own journey, specifically in processing his experience growing up as a second-generation Korean Japanese citizen.
By prioritizing Sunja, Pachinko allows not only for her to have more agency and ownership of her own story, but for Sunja and Solomon’s experiences to stand on their own.

     Pachinko Series-Premiere Recap: Like Grandmother, Like Grandson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Chapter One” begins in 1915 in Japanese-occupied Korea, opening on a distraught Korean woman who begs a mudang (Korean shaman woman) to save her unborn child from the early death that met her previous three children.
The bankers are excited but confused — wasn’t Solomon Japanese?
Though Solomon tries to protest that he’s not ashamed of his father, Sunja persists, saying she’s lived long enough to know what shame smells like.
Or is it Sunja’s father, who doted on his daughter and protected his family until his last breath?
• I was wondering how the show would handle language — characters speak Korean, Japanese, and English.
