     Doja Cat Tweets That She's Quitting Music
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Javier Torres / AFP via Getty ImagesYou might have seen Asunciónico also making headlines because Miley Cyrus's plane got struck by lightning en route to the festival.
Machine Gun Kelly also ended up doing an impromptu show outside his hotel after the cancellation.
However, it's worth mentioning that a seemingly now-deleted tweet from Doja asserts that there weren't any fans outside her hotel when she left the following day.

     Doja Cat's Butterfly Clips and Frosty Eye Shadow Are Making Me Miss My Childhood
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Don't mind us, we're just getting emotional over here from Doja Cat's latest Instagram post.
The rapper took to Instagram to post the cutest Y2K-themed photos on March 24, and she's got us feeling extremely nostalgic.
Staring directly at the camera, her brown eyes are complimented perfectly by her frosty eye shadow; the pastel blue outlines a shimmering light pink tint applied on her lids, and a glittery white hue highlights her inner corners.
Her lips have a nude pink tint, and she's wearing highlighter galore on her cheekbones, the tip of her nose, and her body.
She nailed the Y2K trend perfectly, as her thin eyebrows are superbly sculpted to match that of Pamela Anderson (and everyone else) in the early 2000s.

     Doja Cat tells fans she’s walking away from music: “I quit” – 97.9 WRMF
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doja Cat told fans she is quitting music after a particularly nasty Twitter row with her South American fans.
Fans from Paraguay claim the “Kiss Me More” singer ignored them while she was in the nation’s capital to perform at a music festival, which was later canceled due to inclement weather.
The Twitter thread claims Doja only spoke about the festival to complain fans weren’t waiting for her outside her hotel when she left to go to Brazil.
Y’all take care.” Doja has since changed her Twitter handle to “i quit” and put “lol” in her bio.
It’s unknown if Doja is serious about leaving music, but several artists have reacted to the news — most notably rapper ﻿Kodak Black﻿, who remarked, “Doja Cat Bet Not Quit Musik B4 We Do A Song Together.”Copyright © 2022, ABC Audio.

In a series of tweets, the Planet Her artist said that she’s “not taking pictures” with so-called fans again after her current tour wraps.
Doja and other artists (including Machine Gun Kelly) were set to perform at Asunciónico 2022, with weather ultimately forcing the sets to be canceled.

According to TMZ, fans seemed to be angry that Doja had tweeted about her Brazil show but didn’t say anything about the canceled performance in Paraguay.

     Doja Cat Claims She’s Quitting Music Following Clash With Fans: ‘I Don’t Give A Fuck Anymore’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doja Cat claims she’s throwing in the towel on music following an online clash with fans who criticized the singer for not stopping to interact with fans outside of her hotel in Paraguay where she was scheduled to perform at the two-day Asunción festival on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The backlash towards Doja Cat picked up after she tweeted about leaving following the storm, saying: “When I left the next morning there wasn’t one person outside the hotel waiting for me.
Let that sink in.” She also says she has no plans of taking pictures with anyone after this tour comes to an end.
One fan responded, pointing out that when they spent a full day at the hotel, she didn’t come out to greet them.
I would be lying to you if I said there wasn’t nervousness [about her being online],” her manager Gordan Dillard says.
