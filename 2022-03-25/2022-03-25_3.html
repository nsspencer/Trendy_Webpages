     Doja Cat says she is quitting music
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The music industry is notoriously unforgiving for many reasons, but one aspect that sets it apart from other realms of the entertainment industry is the unique fanaticism.
Fans let music soundtrack their lives, and in turn, expect their favorite artists to be like family.
When fans feel slighted, they can manipulate that false sense of closeness and can come for stars in a scary way.
That’s the situation that Doja Cat found herself in with angry fans from Paraguay on Thursday night.
And after more hate was lobbed at her, fan photos weren’t the only thing she promised to quit.

     Doja Cat tells fans she’s walking away from music: “I quit” – 97.9 WRMF
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doja Cat told fans she is quitting music after a particularly nasty Twitter row with her South American fans.
Fans from Paraguay claim the “Kiss Me More” singer ignored them while she was in the nation’s capital to perform at a music festival, which was later canceled due to inclement weather.
The Twitter thread claims Doja only spoke about the festival to complain fans weren’t waiting for her outside her hotel when she left to go to Brazil.
Y’all take care.” Doja has since changed her Twitter handle to “i quit” and put “lol” in her bio.
It’s unknown if Doja is serious about leaving music, but several artists have reacted to the news — most notably rapper ﻿Kodak Black﻿, who remarked, “Doja Cat Bet Not Quit Musik B4 We Do A Song Together.”Copyright © 2022, ABC Audio.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last night, after engaging in an online fight with fans from Paraguay, rapper Doja Cat tweeted that she is quitting music.
When fans allegedly began to flock around her hotel, looking to take photos with the rapper, she never showed.
Fans seemed particularly angered with Doja for not tweeting or posting any photos from her time in Paraguay (as if that’s a thing she’s obligated to do).

This isn’t the first time the artist has found herself frustrated with the expectations of fame, particularly when it comes to taking photos.

     Doja Cat Tells Fans ‘I F*ckin’ Quit’ Amid Frustrations Over Canceled Festival Set
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doja Cat told fans on Thursday night that she “can’t wait to fucking disappear” amid frustrations with the industry, more specifically the talk surrounding a recently canceled festival set.
In a series of tweets, the Planet Her artist said that she’s “not taking pictures” with so-called fans again after her current tour wraps.
Doja and other artists (including Machine Gun Kelly) were set to perform at Asunciónico 2022, with weather ultimately forcing the sets to be canceled.
Apparently, some fans directed their grievances over the called-off festival slot at Doja herself.
According to TMZ, fans seemed to be angry that Doja had tweeted about her Brazil show but didn’t say anything about the canceled performance in Paraguay.

     Doja Cat Claims She’s Quitting Music Following Clash With Fans: ‘I Don’t Give A Fuck Anymore’

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Doja Cat claims she’s throwing in the towel on music following an online clash with fans who criticized the singer for not stopping to interact with fans outside of her hotel in Paraguay where she was scheduled to perform at the two-day Asunción festival on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The backlash towards Doja Cat picked up after she tweeted about leaving following the storm, saying: “When I left the next morning there wasn’t one person outside the hotel waiting for me.
Let that sink in.” She also says she has no plans of taking pictures with anyone after this tour comes to an end.
One fan responded, pointing out that when they spent a full day at the hotel, she didn’t come out to greet them.
I would be lying to you if I said there wasn’t nervousness [about her being online],” her manager Gordan Dillard says.
