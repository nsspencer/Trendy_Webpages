     Jury finds Rep. Jeff Fortenberry guilty of lying to FBI
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Congressman Jeff Fortenberry, who was found guilty by a federal jury on Thursday of lying to federal investigators when questioned about his campaign contributions, said he is assessing whether to continue his re-election campaign.
Photo courtesy of U.S. House of RepresentativesMarch 25 (UPI) -- A federal jury deliberated for about two hours on Thursday before finding Nebraska Congressman Jeff Fortenberry guilty of three charges stemming from a campaign finance scandal.
Following the conviction, Fortenberry said outside the Los Angeles courthouse that he would appeal the verdict and assess whether to continue his re-election campaign.
Fortenberry, 61, was charged with one count of scheming to falsify and conceal material facts and two counts of making false statements to federal investigators.
The DOJ said that Chagoury donated $30,000 of his money through "straw donors" who attended the 2016 Fortenberry campaign fundraiser held in Los Angeles.

     Jeff Fortenberry Faces Up to 15 Years in Jail Over Campaign Donations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nebraska Rep. Jeff Fortenberry faces up to 15 years in jail after he was found guilty of lying to federal investigators with regards to illegal donations to his 2016 re-election campaign.
The billionaire attempted to get around the rules by giving the money through "straw donors" who attended a Fortenberry campaign fundraiser held in Los Angeles.
Despite hearing about the illegal campaign contribution from a foreign national, Fortenberry did not file an amended report with the Federal Elections Commission.
In subsequent interviews, Fortenberry made "false and misleading" statements to investigators looking into claims of illegal donations to his campaign.
At a second interview in July 2019, Fortenberry again denied being aware of any illegal donations to the 2016 fundraiser.

     Nebraska Rep. Jeff Fortenberry is found guilty in contributions probe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES — U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska was convicted Thursday on charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign from a foreign billionaire at a 2016 Los Angeles fundraiser.
Outside the courthouse, Fortenberry said the process had been unfair and he would appeal immediately.
Fortenberry took a big political hit when prosecutors announced the charges, and his indictment already divided Nebraska Republicans who backed him for years in the conservative district.
Defense lawyers said Fortenberry's flaw was voluntarily meeting with agents and prosecutors to help their probe and having a faulty memory.
Fortenberry asked Ayoub on the phone call to organize another fundraiser with supporters of their cause.
