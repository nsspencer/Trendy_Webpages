     Summary: U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., center, speaks with the media outside the federal courthouse in Los Angeles, Thursday, March 24, 2022.
Fortenberry was convicted Thursday of charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign from a foreign billionaire at a 2016 Los Angeles fundraiser.
(AP Photo/Brian Melley)A federal jury on Thursday convicted Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., on three felony counts for lying to federal investigators about illegal campaign contributions from a foreign billionaire.
According to the indictment, Fortenberry, who denied having knowledge of Chagoury’s involvement, “knowingly and willfully made materially false statements and representations to the FBI and IRS” about the illegal donations.
Fortenberry in October was charged with one count of scheming to falsify and conceal material facts and two counts of making false statements to federal investigators.

     Jeff Fortenberry Faces Up to 15 Years in Jail Over Campaign Donations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nebraska Rep. Jeff Fortenberry faces up to 15 years in jail after he was found guilty of lying to federal investigators with regards to illegal donations to his 2016 re-election campaign.
The billionaire attempted to get around the rules by giving the money through "straw donors" who attended a Fortenberry campaign fundraiser held in Los Angeles.
Despite hearing about the illegal campaign contribution from a foreign national, Fortenberry did not file an amended report with the Federal Elections Commission.
In subsequent interviews, Fortenberry made "false and misleading" statements to investigators looking into claims of illegal donations to his campaign.
At a second interview in July 2019, Fortenberry again denied being aware of any illegal donations to the 2016 fundraiser.

     Congressman Jeff Fortenberry Found Guilty of Concealing Facts and Lying to Investigators Probing Illegal Campaign Contributions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “After learning of illegal contributions to his campaign, the congressman repeatedly chose to conceal the violations of federal law to protect his job, his reputation and his close associates,” said United States Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison.
It is illegal for foreign nationals to make contributions to a federal campaign.
It also is illegal for the true source of campaign contributions to be disguised by funneling the money through third-party conduits.
In response, investigators began looking into whether the Fortenberry campaign received illegal conduit contributions, whether Fortenberry knew about illegal contributions – both foreign contributions and conduit contributions – at the 2016 fundraiser, whether Fortenberry knew about illegal foreign contributions from Chagoury, and whether Fortenberry had any communications with Chagoury in relation to the illegal contributions made at the 2016 fundraiser.
In the spring of 2018, Fortenberry contacted Individual H about hosting another fundraiser.

     Nebraska Rep. Jeff Fortenberry is found guilty in contributions probe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES — U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska was convicted Thursday on charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign from a foreign billionaire at a 2016 Los Angeles fundraiser.
Outside the courthouse, Fortenberry said the process had been unfair and he would appeal immediately.
Fortenberry took a big political hit when prosecutors announced the charges, and his indictment already divided Nebraska Republicans who backed him for years in the conservative district.
Defense lawyers said Fortenberry's flaw was voluntarily meeting with agents and prosecutors to help their probe and having a faulty memory.
Fortenberry asked Ayoub on the phone call to organize another fundraiser with supporters of their cause.
