Saint Peter's had a 10-0 run early to get ahead, as the Purdue defense struggled out of the break.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Sweet 16 of the 2022 NCAA women's basketball tournament tips off Friday in the Greensboro and Spokane regions.
Yori regularly went head-to-head with Iowa State when she was guiding Nebraska while it was still in the Big 12.
Dara Mabrey, left, Sonia Citron (11) and Olivia Miles, right, helped Notre Dame upend NC State 69-66 on Feb. 1.
But NC State plays much better defense than the Sooners, so I wouldn't expect another absurd offensive performance like Monday's.
Creme: If NC State reaches the Final Four, Diamond Johnson is a player we'll be talking about come Tuesday morning.
