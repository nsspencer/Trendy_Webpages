     March Madness 2022: the all-time best college basketball video games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sadly, video game basketball doesn‚Äôt get quite as swept up in the college game excitement.
It‚Äôs understandable ‚Äì the NBA is a truly global product by comparison, and it took NBA 2K until recently to even include the women‚Äôs game.
Outside the US, college basketball is probably seen as equivalent to junior racing formulas or under 21s soccer tournaments ‚Äì a feeder system interesting for its young talents, rather than its own intrinsic spectacle.
Still, March Madness has been documented in depicted in video games, and college teams do sneak into modern NBA 2K games in some form.
And then play these five all-timer college basketball video games.
