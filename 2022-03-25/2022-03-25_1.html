     ‘Bridgerton’ Season 2 isn’t as horny as the first. Its creator explains the ‘slow burn’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This story contains spoilers for “Bridgerton” Season 2.
With the debut season of “Bridgerton,” creator and showrunner Chris Van Dusen had to live up to the expectations of loyal readers of the Julia Quinn novels on which the drama is based.
With the Netflix sensation’s second season, that remains true — only now with the added expectations of some 82 million households.
“I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t overwhelming, but in the best way possible,” Van Dusen says.
It was only natural that certain expectations got placed on this show after the incredible success of the first season.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bridgerton Season 2 Episode 3 (“A Bee In Your Bonnet,” written by Sarah L. Thompson and directed by Alex Pillai) whisks us away to the Bridgerton family seat, Aubrey Hall (played by Wrotham Park) for a weekend of fun and games.
This is a BIG DEAL in terms of courtship, showing Anthony’s marked preference for Edwina, and Edwina can now reasonably expect Anthony to propose.
This episode really underscores how wrong Edwina is for him, but at least his determination to marry her is accountable.
We also have PALL MALL, aka croquet, a cutthroat Bridgerton family competition.
Indeed, the episode ends with Kate and Anthony undiscovered in the garden, another significant departure from the book.

     Summary: But will Eloise (Claudia Jessie) and Lord Anthony (Jonathan Bailey) succeed in their season goals — respectively, to keep away from all potential suitors and to win over the diamond of the season?
The true protagonists of the season aren’t Eloise and the Featheringtons, however, but Anthony and Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley).
Image via NetflixThings begin to change for Lord Anthony when he sees a young woman running through the country on horseback.
Only one thing can put an end to all this unsavory gossip: Lady Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) announcing loud and clear that her son, the viscount, is looking for a wife.
But Kate isn’t having it: as soon as she sees her sister dancing with Lord Bridgerton, she pulls her aside for a little chat.
