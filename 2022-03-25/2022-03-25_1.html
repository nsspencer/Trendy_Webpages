     ‘Bridgerton’ Season 2 isn’t as horny as the first. Its creator explains the ‘slow burn’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This story contains spoilers for “Bridgerton” Season 2.
With the debut season of “Bridgerton,” creator and showrunner Chris Van Dusen had to live up to the expectations of loyal readers of the Julia Quinn novels on which the drama is based.
With the Netflix sensation’s second season, that remains true — only now with the added expectations of some 82 million households.
“I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t overwhelming, but in the best way possible,” Van Dusen says.
It was only natural that certain expectations got placed on this show after the incredible success of the first season.
