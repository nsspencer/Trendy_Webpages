It‚Äôs understandable ‚Äì the NBA is a truly global product by comparison, and it took NBA 2K until recently to even include the women‚Äôs game.
Outside the US, college basketball is probably seen as equivalent to junior racing formulas or under 21s soccer tournaments ‚Äì a feeder system interesting for its young talents, rather than its own intrinsic spectacle.
Still, March Madness has been documented in depicted in video games, and college teams do sneak into modern NBA 2K games in some form.

     Summary: The Sweet 16 of the 2022 NCAA women's basketball tournament tips off Friday in the Greensboro and Spokane regions.
Yori regularly went head-to-head with Iowa State when she was guiding Nebraska while it was still in the Big 12.
Dara Mabrey, left, Sonia Citron (11) and Olivia Miles, right, helped Notre Dame upend NC State 69-66 on Feb. 1.
But NC State plays much better defense than the Sooners, so I wouldn't expect another absurd offensive performance like Monday's.
Creme: If NC State reaches the Final Four, Diamond Johnson is a player we'll be talking about come Tuesday morning.
