     Summary: The Wangs’ business write-offs tell a story of Evelyn trying on other potential lives: as an actor, a singer, a novelist, a chef, a teacher.
“And it does not look good.”But mid-interview, Evelyn’s world fractures, and she’s suddenly thrown into the multiverse.
An alternate version of her husband, called Alpha Waymond, appears.
“If you fall for the temptation,” Alpha Waymond warns, “you invite contradiction.
Jobu is Joy from the Alphaverse, pushed so far by the Alphaverse’s Evelyn that “her mind was fractured,” Alpha Waymond explains.

     Summary: There's a multiverse of roads not taken in 'Everything Everywhere All at Once'Enlarge this image toggle caption A24 A24Multiverses are having something of a moment, popping up in recent movies like Spider-Man: No Way Home and upcoming ones like Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness.
It's refreshing, then, to get a new multiverse movie this week that doesn't spring from the world of comic-book superheroes.
Yeoh plays Evelyn Wang, a Chinese American immigrant who lives in a cramped apartment with her husband, Waymond, played by Ke Huy Quan.
She also learns that she's the only person who can save the whole multiverse from destruction by some powerful force that has taken hold of her daughter, Joy.
There's Evelyn the Hong Kong movie star, Evelyn the Peking opera singer and Evelyn the teppanyaki chef.

     ‘Everything Everywhere All At Once’: Weird Multiverse Adventures, But in Good Way
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, collectively known as Daniels, the movie is an explosion of creative weirdness that is equal parts exhilarating and overwhelming.
EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE ★★★ (3/4 stars)Directed by: Dan Kwan, Daniel ScheinertWritten by: Dan Kwan, Daniel ScheinertStarring: Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Stephanie Hsu, Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr., James Hong, Jamie Lee CurtisRunning time: 139 mins.
Her existence is about as mundane as it gets, so Evelyn is surprised to discover that she’s the key to saving the multiverse from a mysterious evil power.
In one universe, Evelyn is an exhausted wife and mother; in another, she’s a famous kung-fu star.
It’s ground-breaking because it allows a new perspective, but it’s also just blatantly weird.

     Everything Everywhere All at Once Is a Mind-Bending Multiverse Fantasy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The term multiverse has gone from a buzzword in theoretical physics to a tenet of blockbuster storytelling.
Well, by tapping into all the infinite Evelyns out there, of course, and doing battle with a mysterious, cross-dimensional warlord.
But that fantasy premise is a double-edged sword: These other Evelyns have surprising skills to lend, but also alluring memories of events that Evelyn herself will never get to experience.
The film’s fantasy conceit lines up with the melancholic question at the core of Evelyn and Waymond’s relationship—would they have been better off apart?
The multiverse is an exciting notion, and a narratively thrilling one.

     ‘Everything Everywhere All At Once’ Review: Michelle Yeoh’s Insane Multiverse Comedy Lives Up to Its Name

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To make matters worse, Evelyn doesn’t know Waymond has divorce papers, and IRS inspector Diedre (a hilariously wild Jamie Lee Curtis) accuses the laundromat of fraud.
As someone tells Evelyn later in the film, Evelyn is living her worst you.
And like Swiss Army Man says: everything everywhere matters to everything.
Everything Everywhere has to be as nutso as it is to prove its point: when everything is possible, what truly matters?
If Daniels had said they had spent the six years since Swiss Army Man filming Everything Everywhere All At Once and putting together this awe-inspiring world, it would make perfect sense.

     Summary: What, to your minds, does it mean to craft a cinematic love letter, though?
But when I think about my love letters, when I truly love someone and write to them, they aren’t precious.
Honestly, I think “love letter” isn’t the right word anymore; it’s so much more than that.
You mentioned the concept of generational love, which isn’t something that we hear about all that much as we’ve begun to talk more about generational trauma.
I think one of the things about generational love that we kind of came to while making this was empathy.

To note that Evelyn is not the kind of woman whose interior landscape gets explored onscreen is an understatement.
Everything Everywhere All at Once is the second feature from the directing duo of Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, a.k.a.
Daniels, who started in music videos and inventive shorts before graduating to the 2016 film Swiss Army Man.
That said, it’s a movie with an extended bit about a misremembered Ratatouille, with a hot-dog-fingers reality, and with talking rocks.
