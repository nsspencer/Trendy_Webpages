     Saudi Aramco Fuel Depot Hit as Drone Attacks Escalate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An oil storage facility in Saudi Arabia was hit by a barrage of drone attacks on Friday, in a marked escalation of tensions in one of the world’s most important regions for oil shipments.
State oil producer Saudi Aramco’s North Jeddah Bulk Plant -- a storage facility -- was hit, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed a series of attacks on Aramco facilities on Friday, sending oil prices higher.

     Fire breaks out at Jeddah oil depot before Saudi Arabia grand prix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The blaze – not immediately acknowledged by Saudi Arabia or its state-run oil company Saudi Aramco – was centred on the same fuel depot that the Houthis had attacked in recent days.
The attacks came as Saudi Arabia still leads a coalition battling the Iran-backed Houthis, who seized Yemen’s capital of Sana’a in September 2014.
Another attack targeted an electrical substation in an area of southwestern Saudi Arabia near the Yemeni border, state TV said.
A cloud of smoke rises from a burning oil depot in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
Cruise missiles and drones remain difficult to defend against, though the US recently sent a significant number of Patriot anti-missile interceptors to Saudi Arabia to resupply the kingdom amid the Houthi attacks.

     Saudi Arabia: Houthis strike Jeddah oil depot ahead of F1 race weekend
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yemen's Houthi rebels struck an oil depot in the Saudi city of Jeddah on Friday in a missile attack that caused a large fire and left clouds of black smoke hanging over the port city.
The Yemeni group acknowledged they had launched a series of attacks on the kingdom ahead of the F1 Grand Prix race scheduled to take place there.
Saudi Arabia and the state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco did not immediately acknowledge the blaze, though it appeared to be on the same fuel depot that the Houthis attacked in recent days.
The Saudi-led coalition early Saturday launched air strikes "against sources of threat in Sanaa and Hodeida" following the Jeddah attack, the official Saudi news agency SPA tweeted.
The North Jeddah Bulk Plant stores diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel for use in Jeddah, the kingdom's second-largest city.

“What was it, a grandstand play?”Continued focus on the issueAn ever-evolving landscape of companies have been named the top political donor to the 147 election objectors.
In one notable example, Toyota (TM) made headlines for continuing donations to election objectors early on before abruptly announcing last July it was stopping the practice.
Despite reluctance of companies like Toyota to continue donating to those Republicans, OpenSecrets recently found election objectors are among the top fundraisers among Republicans heading into mid-terms.
