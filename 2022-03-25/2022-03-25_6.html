     Summary: (Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)The UNC basketball program has a date with the UCLA Bruins in the Sweet 16 and a former Tar Heel has us even more hyped for the game than we already were.
North Carolina is in the Sweet 16 for the first time in three years and Tar Heel fans are as excited as they’ve been in a long time.
As if they needed more reason to be excited about the game, UNC fans got a pre-game hype video narrated by none other than former North Carolina sharpshooter Danny Green.
Do the Tar Heels have more left in them this month?

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UNC Basketball: Everything You Need to Know About the Tar Heels’ Brady ManekUNC basketball’s Brady Manek has become the talk of the 2022 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.
The fifth-year senior has been one of the Tar Heels’ best players this seasonhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCqCOuapws4Carolina was up by 25 points when Manek was ejected against Baylor.
It’s no coincidence that the 23-year-old is playing his best basketball as the Tar Heels play theirs.
It’s not a bad matchup for the Tar Heels’ forward — the biggest issue will be defending Jaquez on the perimeter.
But the former Sooner has been arguably the Tar Heels’ best player over the past two months.
