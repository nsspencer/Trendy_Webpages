     UNC Basketball: Tar Heels’ five-star recruit attends thrilling Sweet 16 game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images)A five-star UNC basketball recruit was in attendance for the Tar Heels’ thrilling victory over the UCLA Bruins in the Sweet 16.
That somebody, who watched the Tar Heels withstand the best effort of a team that reached the Final Four last year and seemed destined to do the same this year, was class of 2023 recruit Simeon Wilcher.
Simeon Wilcher and his father Sergio are in Philadelphia to watch North Carolina/UCLA in the Sweet 16 as well as Saint Peter’s/Purdue.
Wilcher, fresh off leading his team to the New Jersey Tournament of Champions title, is the No.
He committed to North Carolina nearly two years before he was due to step foot onto a college campus.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UNC Basketball: Everything You Need to Know About the Tar Heels’ Brady ManekUNC basketball’s Brady Manek has become the talk of the 2022 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.
The fifth-year senior has been one of the Tar Heels’ best players this seasonhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCqCOuapws4Carolina was up by 25 points when Manek was ejected against Baylor.
It’s no coincidence that the 23-year-old is playing his best basketball as the Tar Heels play theirs.
It’s not a bad matchup for the Tar Heels’ forward — the biggest issue will be defending Jaquez on the perimeter.
But the former Sooner has been arguably the Tar Heels’ best player over the past two months.

Saint Peter’s improbably toppled heavily favored Purdue on a Friday night that also saw a No.
There should be no pressure left on Saint Peter’s to accomplish just about anything, while its more esteemed opponents deal with the psychic weight of an upset.
And, as the Tar Heels may soon be horrified to learn: He’s also one of the patron saints invoked for foot ailments.

     Caleb Love’s Career-High Catapults UNC Basketball into Elite Eight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last weekend against Baylor, UNC sophomore guard Caleb Love watched the end of the game from the bench after fouling out.
Love, who only had three points on 1-8 shooting in the first half, decided it was time for a change of footwear.
“[Director of Operations Eric] Hoots told me to change them because I never play good in the black shoes,” Love said.
After three free throws and a jumper from fellow sophomore R.J. Davis gave Carolina the lead, Love took command by scoring UNC’s next 12 points.
Juzang and Campbell, both starters on UCLA’s Final Four team a year ago, combined to score 29 points on the night.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The sophomore guard for the fifth-seeded North Carolina Tar Heels never backed down from South Carolina, the No.
Despite Kelly’s 23 points, North Carolina fell in the Sweet 16 in the Greensboro Coliseum on Friday, losing 69-61 to South Carolina in front of an announced crowd of 8,811 fans.

In all, South Carolina outscored North Carolina 17-8 in the second quarter, and took an eight-point lead into halftime.
