     Taylor Hawkins, Foo Fighters’ Drummer, Dies at 50
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In joining the band, Mr. Hawkins was charged with assuming the seat of one of contemporary rock’s most distinct, powerful and beloved drummers.
At this year’s Grammys, where Foo Fighters were scheduled to perform on April 3, “Medicine at Midnight” was nominated for three awards, including best rock performance (for the song “Making a Fire”), best rock song (“Waiting on a War”) and best rock album.
Beginning in 2006, he released three albums with a side project, the cheekily named Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders.
He also played in a cover band called Chevy Metal and a prog-rock band called the Birds of Satan.
Last year, he teamed up with the guitarist Dave Navarro and the bassist Chris Chaney to form a band called NHC; the group’s debut EP, “Intakes &amp; Outtakes,” was released in February.

     Summary: The first time I saw Taylor Hawkins, I was stunned.
The Foos found their own sound, of which Taylor Hawkins’ playing was as big a part as anyone in the band not named Grohl.
The band issued a statement Friday evening through its publicity company, Nasty Little Man:“The Foo Fighters family is devastated by the tragic and untimely loss of our beloved Taylor Hawkins.
He had his own side projects, including Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders and cover band Chevy Metal.

     R.I.P. Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Taylor Hawkins, who served for 25 years as the legendary drummer for rock band Foo Fighters, has died.
But when Hawkins’ acquaintance (and fellow drummer) Dave Grohl approached him for recommendations for a replacement for outgoing Foo Fighters drummer William Goldsmith, Hawkins skipped the recommendations, and simply put his own name forward.
(Grohl reportedly hadn’t even bothered to ask, considering how much bigger a name Alanis Morissette was at the time than Foo Fighters.)
Hawkins would spend the next 25 years with the band, appearing on their third album, There Is Nothing Left To Lose, forward.
In addition to his drumming, Hawkins was also a deeply involved member of Foo Fighters , period, sharing songwriting duties, taking on vocals, and becoming a huge part of the group’s identity throughout his long tenure with it .
