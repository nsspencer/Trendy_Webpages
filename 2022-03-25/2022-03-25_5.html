     Summary: Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins dies at 50Enlarge this image toggle caption Amy Harris/Invision/AP Amy Harris/Invision/APTaylor Hawkins, the long-time drummer for the mega-platinum Foo Fighters, has died.
Hawkins' death was confirmed by the band in an online post late Friday night.
Hawkins, was scheduled to play with the Foo Fighters in Bogota, Colombia, Friday.
With his frenzied, frenetic energy — he didn't play the drums so much as pounded them — Hawkins was the perfect complement to singer and guitarist Dave Grohl.
In the book, Grohl called Hawkins his "best friend and partner in crime."

     Taylor Hawkins, Foo Fighters’ Drummer, Dies at 50
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Foo Fighters’ most recent album, “Medicine at Midnight,” arrived last year as the group was celebrating its 25th anniversary, and in an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Hawkins was direct about his hopes for its future.
Mr. Hawkins was born in Texas on Feb. 17, 1972, and raised in Southern California.
He started to play drums at age 10, and said that his mother gave him the confidence to dream big: “When I first got drums, she was the one who would watch me play.
She was a big supporter and told me I’d make it,” he said in an interview last year.
“After that concert, I don’t think I slept for three days,” he said in a 2021 interview with the metal magazine Kerrang.

     R.I.P. Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Taylor Hawkins, who served for 25 years as the legendary drummer for rock band Foo Fighters, has died.
But when Hawkins’ acquaintance (and fellow drummer) Dave Grohl approached him for recommendations for a replacement for outgoing Foo Fighters drummer William Goldsmith, Hawkins skipped the recommendations, and simply put his own name forward.
(Grohl reportedly hadn’t even bothered to ask, considering how much bigger a name Alanis Morissette was at the time than Foo Fighters.)
Hawkins would spend the next 25 years with the band, appearing on their third album, There Is Nothing Left To Lose, forward.
In addition to his drumming, Hawkins was also a deeply involved member of Foo Fighters , period, sharing songwriting duties, taking on vocals, and becoming a huge part of the group’s identity throughout his long tenure with it .
