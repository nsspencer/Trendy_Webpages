     Pop Covers in Bridgerton Season 2 Scenes &amp; Timestamps
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you listened to the Vitamin String Quartet's instrumental cover of "thank u, next" by Ariana Grande from season one of Bridgerton on repeat, you're not alone.
The six pop covers in the first season of the Regency romance were such a hit that there was no question there would be a new line-up of incredible instrumental covers in season two.
Each one is incredibly powerful and deeply emotional in its own special way," Bridgerton showrunner Chris Van Dusen told Netflix's Tudum publication.
"I always try many different songs for any one scene before landing on the perfect one to use.
Here are the 10 pop songs that appear in Bridgerton season two—and the time-stamped moments you can hear them.

     Behind 'Bridgerton' Season 2's inspired Bollywood cover
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bridgerton Season 2 soundtrack took our breath away.
Episode 6, "The Choice," opens with a first for Bridgerton : A string cover of the massively popular Bollywood song "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham" while Edwina (Charithra Chandran) gets ready for her wedding (or so she thinks).
The Bollywood song choice is inspired for a number of reasons and a delightful Easter egg for K3G fans (that's what we call it) around the world.
Anthony and Kate's slow-burning romance is the stuff of Bollywood legend , and including this song is the cherry on top of a scrumptious new season.
Bridgerton Season 2 is now streaming on Netflix.

     Where Did All the Sex Go In Bridgerton Season 2?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bridgerton season one was the period piece manifestation of the well-worn maxim “a lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets.” Yet Bridgerton’s second season, which hits Netflix today, has almost completely done away with the sex that defined the first season—much to its detriment.
And as a result, season one’s three-minute long sex montages have been traded for hushed whispers in gardens.
Bridgerton’s first season fit more squarely in this narrative, with Bustle going so far as to rank the show’s sex scenes based on how much of Page’s butt we could see at any given time.
But by design, this season was always more about the sexiness of restraint than the sexiness of, well, sex.
While some may appreciate the purity and prudity of season two, many will find that Bridgerton didn’t turn up the heat until the bitter end.

     Bridgerton Season-Finale Recap: One Last Time

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lady Mary and Lady Danbury run in, thrilled.
Kate asks about Anthony and they tell her how he gallantly rescued her.
I generally watch Bridgerton to witness horniness, not heaviness, and yet I found this moment so affecting and cathartic.
A dolled-up Lady Mary drops in on Kate, who’s packing in her room, unsure if she’ll attend the ball that night.
Kate brings up how Lady Mary took her in, never treating her differently, and Lady Mary is horrified to realize Kate feels indebted to her.
