     Summary: The Wangs’ business write-offs tell a story of Evelyn trying on other potential lives: as an actor, a singer, a novelist, a chef, a teacher.
“And it does not look good.”But mid-interview, Evelyn’s world fractures, and she’s suddenly thrown into the multiverse.
An alternate version of her husband, called Alpha Waymond, appears.
“If you fall for the temptation,” Alpha Waymond warns, “you invite contradiction.
Jobu is Joy from the Alphaverse, pushed so far by the Alphaverse’s Evelyn that “her mind was fractured,” Alpha Waymond explains.

     Everything Everywhere All at Once Is a Mind-Bending Multiverse Fantasy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The term multiverse has gone from a buzzword in theoretical physics to a tenet of blockbuster storytelling.
Well, by tapping into all the infinite Evelyns out there, of course, and doing battle with a mysterious, cross-dimensional warlord.
But that fantasy premise is a double-edged sword: These other Evelyns have surprising skills to lend, but also alluring memories of events that Evelyn herself will never get to experience.
The film’s fantasy conceit lines up with the melancholic question at the core of Evelyn and Waymond’s relationship—would they have been better off apart?
The multiverse is an exciting notion, and a narratively thrilling one.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And the stakes couldn't be higher: the very survival of the entire multiverse is on the line.
Directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert—collectively known as Daniels—are known for their ability to straddle genres, deftly blending comic absurdity and outré weirdness with moments of gut-wrenching poignancy.
The two creators said they found inspiration while writing the script in classic kung-fu films, as well as The Matrix and Fight Club.
Daniel Kwan: One of the first times I thought about the multiverse was maybe 15 years ago.
I got so sucked into modal realism that I never finished the movie.

     Everything Everywhere All at Once Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Is it possible to make a film that’s not for everyone but also about everyone?
At the centre of Daniels’ film is the magnetic Michelle Yeoh, who’s never had a lead role like this in an American film.
She stars as Evelyn, a put upon immigrant mother and laundromat owner, tending to her cheery husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), her distant daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu), and aging father Gong Gong (James Hong).
It also allows them to employ pop culture references (The Matrix‘s kung-fu, Wong Kar-wai, and Ratatouille figure prominently) which is fun—even as it clashes with the film’s attempts at sincerity.
Fortunately for Daniels, watching Yeoh never grows tiresome regardless of their bits that are too one-note to work all the way through.

     Summary: Multiverses are having something of a moment, popping up in recent movies like Spider-Man: No Way Home and upcoming ones like Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness.
It's refreshing, then, to get a new multiverse movie this week that doesn't spring from the world of comic-book superheroes.
Yeoh plays Evelyn Wang, a Chinese American immigrant who lives in a cramped apartment with her husband, Waymond, played by Ke Huy Quan.
She also learns that she's the only person who can save the whole multiverse from destruction by some powerful force that has taken hold of her daughter, Joy.
There's Evelyn the Hong Kong movie star, Evelyn the Peking opera singer and Evelyn the teppanyaki chef.

'Groundhog Day' | Columbia PicturesIt's a Wonderful Life and Groundhog Day Structure is a crucial component to any film, but Daniels looked specifically at films that upended the traditional narrative cues and pathways.
So like we're huge A Ghost Story fans and huge fans of Holy Motors, Leos Carax's film.
"A Day in the Life" by the Beatles is one of my favorite songs of all time.

Credit: A24Now, I understand all my talk of the overwhelming everything of Everything Everywhere At All Times might make the movie itself seem anxiety-inducing.
Perhaps because Daniels seem to see us, those who feel the burden of this everything everywhere at all times.
It's not just destined to be one of the best films of the year, but also a classic comedy, sure to be treasured for decades to come.

     Summary: What, to your minds, does it mean to craft a cinematic love letter, though?
But when I think about my love letters, when I truly love someone and write to them, they aren’t precious.
Honestly, I think “love letter” isn’t the right word anymore; it’s so much more than that.
You mentioned the concept of generational love, which isn’t something that we hear about all that much as we’ve begun to talk more about generational trauma.
I think one of the things about generational love that we kind of came to while making this was empathy.
