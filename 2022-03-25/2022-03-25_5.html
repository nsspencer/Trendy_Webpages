     WWE legend Triple H announces retirement from wrestling: ‘I’m done’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wrestling legend Triple H has revealed that he never plans to enter the ring again, KTLA sister station WTRF reported.
In an emotional interview with ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith, Triple H confirmed that he’s retiring from in-ring activity after suffering a cardiac event last year.
Do you wake up from this?’ That’s tough to swallow,” said Triple H, choking up.
Triple H underwent a successful procedure at Yale New Haven Hospital following his cardiac event, which WWE said in September had been “caused by a genetic issue.” At the time, WWE added that Triple H was expected to make a full recovery.
When asked about his future in wrestling for ESPN’s interview, Triple H didn’t mince words.
