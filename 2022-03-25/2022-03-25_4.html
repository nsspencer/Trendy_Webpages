     Pop Covers in Bridgerton Season 2 Scenes &amp; Timestamps
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you listened to the Vitamin String Quartet's instrumental cover of "thank u, next" by Ariana Grande from season one of Bridgerton on repeat, you're not alone.
The six pop covers in the first season of the Regency romance were such a hit that there was no question there would be a new line-up of incredible instrumental covers in season two.
Each one is incredibly powerful and deeply emotional in its own special way," Bridgerton showrunner Chris Van Dusen told Netflix's Tudum publication.
"I always try many different songs for any one scene before landing on the perfect one to use.
Here are the 10 pop songs that appear in Bridgerton season two—and the time-stamped moments you can hear them.

     Bridgerton Season 2 Ending Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The second epilogue takes place beginning two days before Anthony’s birthday and it’s all about the lead-up to the annual Bridgerton family Pall Mall match plus the game itself.
The game itself is the usual Bridgerton family battle of wit, wills, and occasional cheating to get the upper hand or possession of the Mallet of Death.
Bridgerton Season 2’s final scene shifts the timeline of the annual Pall Mall game to shortly after Kate and Anthony are officially married.
Anthony believes he truly fell in love with Kate during the Pall Mall game.
Fans of the novels may often dispute Bridgerton adaptation choices but it’s clear the epilogues will be shown in some form to end each season.

     On “Bridgerton" Season 2, Brownness, and the Intimacy of Cultural Tradition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In this op-ed, writer Vandana Pawa analyzes Bridgerton season 2 and how the impactful moments of intimacy between the Sharmas are informed by cultural traditions.
In Bridgerton season 2, newcomer and diamond of the season Edwina Sharma refers to her sister Kate as “didi,” the Hindi word for “older sister,” and the only thing I’ve ever called my own sister since I learned how to talk.
The first time Edwina uttered it on screen, casually sprinkled within a conversation otherwise spoken in English, I gasped.
Despite being an honorific of sorts, in my experience, “didi” implies a connection that can only come with the intimacy of sisterhood.
The Sharmas are the focal point of Bridgerton season 2, with British Indian actresses Simone and Charithra at the helm.

     Where Did All the Sex Go In Bridgerton Season 2?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bridgerton season one was the period piece manifestation of the well-worn maxim “a lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets.” Yet Bridgerton’s second season, which hits Netflix today, has almost completely done away with the sex that defined the first season—much to its detriment.
And as a result, season one’s three-minute long sex montages have been traded for hushed whispers in gardens.
Bridgerton’s first season fit more squarely in this narrative, with Bustle going so far as to rank the show’s sex scenes based on how much of Page’s butt we could see at any given time.
But by design, this season was always more about the sexiness of restraint than the sexiness of, well, sex.
While some may appreciate the purity and prudity of season two, many will find that Bridgerton didn’t turn up the heat until the bitter end.

The true protagonists of the season aren’t Eloise and the Featheringtons, however, but Anthony and Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley).
Image via NetflixThings begin to change for Lord Anthony when he sees a young woman running through the country on horseback.
Only one thing can put an end to all this unsavory gossip: Lady Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) announcing loud and clear that her son, the viscount, is looking for a wife.
But Kate isn’t having it: as soon as she sees her sister dancing with Lord Bridgerton, she pulls her aside for a little chat.
