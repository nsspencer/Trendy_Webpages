     Apple's deep pockets made it the only streamer able to fund 'Pachinko' drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apple TV+ beat four major rivals to get the international drama "Pachinko," but it was also the only one able to fully fund the costly production by itself.
As "Pachinko" premieres on Apple TV+ on March 25, 2022, its producers have revealed how it took many years and Apple's budget to get the show made.
According to Variety, the series was first pitched to TV networks four years ago.
However, Apple TV+ won the bid and reportedly did so chiefly because it was the only streamer or network willing to put up the full cost of production.
But it also does so without having to collaborate with any other streamer or network.

     Apple TV’s Pachinko is an enthralling historical epic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The nonlinear construction of time in the Pachinko series marks a significant departure from Lee’s novel, which progresses chronologically, turning this adaptation into a radically different project.
One episode towards the later part of the series also takes a historical detour that feels particularly disjointed with the rest of the story.
He is unfazed by the “one landowner hold[ing] the entire deal hostage” — an elderly zainichi Korean lady, Grandmother Han.
In many ways, the enormity of the Pachinko series extends far beyond the small screens we watch it on.
In Pachinko, Apple has woven together an extraordinary project that will hopefully herald many more to come.

     Pachinko review: Apple TV’s heartfelt new series is a singular epic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet, Apple TV Plus’ newest drama, Pachinko, manages to take all of these tropes and refine them into something beautifully specific and new: a Korean family epic.
Pachinko doesn’t fit into one genre box because it escapes the trappings of traditional historical fiction (see: Downton Abbey’s penchant for style over substance).
And he will be loved.” Men may have put her in this position, but she will find a way out; Sunja doesn’t need saving from her misfortune.
Solomon does go through his own journey, specifically in processing his experience growing up as a second-generation Korean Japanese citizen.
By prioritizing Sunja, Pachinko allows not only for her to have more agency and ownership of her own story, but for Sunja and Solomon’s experiences to stand on their own.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This atrocity, whose impact on the Korean people still reverberates in the present, forms the backdrop of Min Jin Lee’s magnificent 2017 novel Pachinko.
Youn Yuh-jung in 'Pachinko' Apple TV+Spanning most of the 20th century, Pachinko opens in the woods of rural, Japanese-occupied Korea in 1915.
Jin Ha in 'Pachinko' Apple TV+There is a symmetry to this structure, one that magnifies some of Pachinko’s most salient themes.
It was a wise choice, and one that has only become possible in the streaming era, to mix Korean, Japanese, and English dialogue; color-coded subtitles efficiently convey how characters combine tongues and code-switch.
Even when you account for its shortcomings, though, TV’s Pachinko remains the rare show of both artistic and historic import.
