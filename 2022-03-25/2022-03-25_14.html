     Nebraska Congressman Faces Calls to Step Down After Convictions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Although Mr. Fortenberry had already forfeited his committee assignments in accordance with House Republican rules for members who face federal indictments, a conviction does not automatically disqualify him from keeping his seat.
He could be expelled, if two-thirds of House members vote to approve, but such a measure is exceedingly rare.
Many House members who are convicted of crimes resign well before reaching that point.
“Five and a half years ago, a person from overseas illegally moved money to my campaign,” Mr. Fortenberry said in a video he posted online at the time.
Mr. Fortenberry, who has been in Congress for almost two decades, received a $30,000 donation to his re-election campaign at a fund-raiser in 2016, according to the federal indictment in the case.

     Nebraska Rep. Jeff Fortenberry is found guilty in contributions probe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES — U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska was convicted Thursday on charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign from a foreign billionaire at a 2016 Los Angeles fundraiser.
Outside the courthouse, Fortenberry said the process had been unfair and he would appeal immediately.
Fortenberry took a big political hit when prosecutors announced the charges, and his indictment already divided Nebraska Republicans who backed him for years in the conservative district.
Defense lawyers said Fortenberry's flaw was voluntarily meeting with agents and prosecutors to help their probe and having a faulty memory.
Fortenberry asked Ayoub on the phone call to organize another fundraiser with supporters of their cause.
