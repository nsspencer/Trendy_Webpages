    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The sequel to the Borderlands spinoff starring everyone's favorite teenage explosives expert, Tiny Tina, is officially here.
Tiny Tina's Wonderlands combines the first-person shooter style that Borderlands players love with action RPG elements, making this a fantasy game franchise fans can sink hours into.
But does the new game support multiplayer options, both remote and online?
Does it also support cross-play for the multiple consoles on which it's been released?

     How to fix the ‘Connection Lost’ error in Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands￼
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Launch days for most games that feature online elements tend to involve at least a few issues, specifically when it comes to multiplayer and online connectivity.
This has proven true for Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, as players attempting to enjoy their time with the Borderlands spinoff have encountered several problems.
The most common issue players have experienced is a “Connection Lost” error message that pops up and notifies them that their online session is likely experiencing at least a few problems.
This error specifically ties into SHiFT, which is a program developed by Gearbox Software that rewards fans with additional in-game content through the use of code and item redemption.
Unfortunately, outside of checking your own internet connection and restarting the game, you likely won’t be able to fix the Connection Lost error if it specifically deals with SHiFT.

     Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands: Best Character Backgrounds For Your Class
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While there are times when I wish Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands was closer to the classic role-playing game that it often styles itself as, the looter shooter’s use of background stories during the character creation process makes the most out of a classic RPG mechanic.
Your background story in Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands not only adds a little flavor to your character but raises and lowers some of your key stats.
You’ve seen similar systems in other RPGs (most notably the Fallout franchise), but since this is kind of a new concept for the Borderlands series, you may be left wondering what your best background story option really is.
That being the case, here’s a better look at which background stories are best for your favorite class and which ones you should avoid at all costs.

     A Few Hours In, I Can Tell Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands Will Destroy My Free Time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The best thing I can say about Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is that I regret starting it.
Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands scratches the “numbers go up and enemy health bars go down” itch video games have instilled in so many of us.
Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, out today for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, is a fantasy-inspired spinoff of Borderlands that bucks (some of) those expectations.
But Wonderlands quickly tees up a bunch of features that haven’t been present in any previous Borderlands game.
But for now, I’m happy to report that Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is some solid, mindless fun, the sort of thing that’s bound to devour every second of my free time in the coming weeks.

     The best Tiny Tina's Wonderlands builds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tiny Tina's Wonderlands build system will be pretty familiar to anyone who's played the numbered Borderlands entries in the past.
The biggest change this time around is the "multi-class" function, allowing you to mix and match the abilities of one additional Tiny Tina's Wonderlands class with your main one.
With that in mind, let's go over some of the best builds in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, followed by some multi-class suggestions.
The latter increases spell damage at the cost of your ward's automatic regeneration, while Mage Armor regenerates your ward on casting a spell.
Two main paths presented to the Clawbringer are focusing on guns and fire elemental damage, or melee and lightning damage.
