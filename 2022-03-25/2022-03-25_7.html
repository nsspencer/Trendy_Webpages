     Summary: The case of whether a former Nashville nurse, RaDonda Vaught, should face jail time in the death of a patient after a medication error at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 2017 is now with a jury.
Vaught, 38, was indicted in 2019 on two charges — reckless homicide and impaired adult abuse — in the death of Charlene Murphey at Vanderbilt University Medical Center just after Christmas 2017.
Vaught was stripped of her license by the Tennessee Board of Nursing in July, after the board initially chose not to investigate the death.

'ZERO REGRETS ABOUT TELLING THE TRUTH':Ex-nurse RaDonda Vaught speaks out ahead of guilty verdictMurphey was supposed to receive a dose of Versed, a sedative, but was instead injected with vecuronium, which left her unable to breathe, prosecutors have said.
“RaDonda Vaught probably did not intend to kill Ms. Murphey, but she made a knowing choice," Assistant District Attorney Brittani Flatt said Thursday during the state's closing arguments.
There were multiple chances for RaDonda Vaught to just pay attention," Assistant District Attorney Chad Jackson said in a rebuttal during closing arguments.

     Summary: RaDonda Vaught speaks with reporters while awaiting verdictVaught said she believes no matter the outcome, this trial will have a lasting impact on those who work in health care.
Vaught accused the judge and prosecution of not having any knowledge about health care or nursing.
"That is what sets health care workers apart from people like them [DA's office].
Concluding the interview, the former nurse reiterated that she takes responsibility for her actions, but stated that health care professionals have to work together.
I have not shied away from my responsibility but health care is a system.

     Summary: A former Tennessee nurse is guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the death of a patient who was accidentally given the wrong medication, a jury found Friday.
RaDonda Vaught, 37, injected the paralyzing drug vecuronium into 75-year-old Charlene Murphey instead of the sedative Versed on Dec. 26, 2017.
Interviewed after the verdict, Vaught said she was relieved to have a resolution after 4 1/2 years and hopes Murphey’s family is relieved as well.
Assistant District Attorney Chadwick Jackson told the jury in closing arguments, “RaDonda Vaught acted recklessly, and Charlene Murphey died as a result of that.
RaDonda Vaught had a duty of care to Charlene Murphey and RaDonda Vaught neglected that.

     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – Emotions in the courtroom were mixed Friday after former Vanderbilt nurse RaDonda Vaught was found guilty on two charges in the 2017 death of 75-year-old Charlene Murphey.
However, before the verdict came in, the former Vanderbilt nurse told News 2 she is at peace with today’s decision.
That a verdict doesn’t impact the fact that she has to live with this fatal mistake forever.
Nurses from across the state and beyond traveled to Nashville to support Vaught, as others watched from across the country.
The family of Charlene Murphey didn’t want to comment, but they are from the same small community as Vaught – Bethpage.

Medical errors are generally handled by professional licensing boards or civil courts, and criminal prosecutions like Vaught's case are exceedingly rare.
The neglect charge stemmed from allegations that Vaught did not properly monitor Murphey after she was injected with the wrong drug.
During the trial, prosecutors painted Vaught as an irresponsible and uncaring nurse who ignored her training and abandoned her patient.
"I know the reason this patient is no longer here is because of me," Vaught told the nursing board, starting to cry.
