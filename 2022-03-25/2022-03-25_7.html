     Kansas men’s basketball passes Kentucky’s all-time win record with Sweet 16 win vs. Providence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CHICAGO — Kansas men’s basketball coach Bill Self again downplayed the significance this week of the Jayhawks potentially passing the Kentucky Wildcats for the lead in all-time victories.
Kansas topped Providence in a 66-61 victory that’ll send the Jayhawks to face either Iowa State or Miami for a spot in the Final Four, and puts Kansas at 2,354 all-time wins.
In the second half, Martin didn’t hit as many shots from the field but still finished with a team-high 23 points.
As a team, the Jayhawks finished shooting 39.3% from the field, 14.3% from behind the arc and 71.4% from the free-throw line.
Kansas just didn’t do enough to take advantage of Providence shooting 33.8% from the field, 17.4% from behind the arc and 68.8% from the free-throw line.

     Summary: CHICAGO --- It took a member of college basketball royalty to end this special season for Providence.
Kansas enjoyed a six-point advantage over the final 5:21, rallying after Providence took its only lead of the night.
This was a special, special, special group.
Kansas responded with the deciding 7-0 run, finally breaking what had been an indomitable spirit shown by Providence through the opening 35 minutes.
“They were starting to talk a little bit.”Kansas became just the second team to defeat the Friars in a single-digit game this season.

     Kansas Jayhawks lean on defense, bounce Providence Friars in Sweet 16 of NCAA tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CHICAGO -- As Kansas prepared to face Providence in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament, Jayhawks coach Bill Self reluctantly acknowledged his team's improvement on defense.
Self was a bit giddier after Kansas' defense propelled it to a 66-61 win over Providence at the United Center.
Kansas, which passed Kentucky and become college basketball's all-time winningest program with its 2,354th victory, is the only No.
Wilson (16 points) and Remy Martin (season-high 23 points) were the only Kansas players to score in double figures.
Self wasn't as pleased with Kansas' defense in the second half, as Providence scored 44 points on 48.5% shooting.

     Summary: Remy Martin scored a game-high 23 for Kansas, while Wilson had 16 points and 11 rebounds.
Here are a few takeaways from Kansas' win in the Sweet 16 on Friday.
Providence shot just 20% from the floor and the Friars had as many shots blocked (seven) as they made.
When Kansas went on its own rough offensive run, Providence bullied inside with Ed Croswell and hit from the outside with Horschler.
While Providence didn't quite have enough firepower to finish the job, the Friars acquitted themselves well.

     Kansas Jayhawks, last 1 seed standing, reach Elite 8 with late surge against Providence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 seed Kansas’ defense — not the offense that put up 83 and 79 points in the Jayhawks’ first two NCAA Tournament games — that fueled a 66-61 Sweet 16 victory over No.
Details of what some might call an “ugly win” didn’t seem to bother the Jayhawks, who move on to Sunday’s Elite Eight game against No.
He’s been able to save us out of situations when we need a shot late in the clock.
But right now I think he’s doing enough stuff to help us win and we’ve had other guys step up.
And he had a couple of touches in there we came away with nothing that could have been points.
