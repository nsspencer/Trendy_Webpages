     Summary: The case of whether a former Nashville nurse, RaDonda Vaught, should face jail time in the death of a patient after a medication error at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 2017 is now with a jury.
Vaught, 38, was indicted in 2019 on two charges — reckless homicide and impaired adult abuse — in the death of Charlene Murphey at Vanderbilt University Medical Center just after Christmas 2017.
Vaught was stripped of her license by the Tennessee Board of Nursing in July, after the board initially chose not to investigate the death.

“RaDonda Vaught probably did not intend to kill Ms. Murphey, but she made a knowing choice," Assistant District Attorney Brittani Flatt said Thursday during the state's closing arguments.
There were multiple chances for RaDonda Vaught to just pay attention," Assistant District Attorney Chad Jackson said in a rebuttal during closing arguments.

Medical errors are generally handled by professional licensing boards or civil courts, and criminal prosecutions like Vaught's case are exceedingly rare.
The neglect charge stemmed from allegations that Vaught did not properly monitor Murphey after she was injected with the wrong drug.
During the trial, prosecutors painted Vaught as an irresponsible and uncaring nurse who ignored her training and abandoned her patient.
"I know the reason this patient is no longer here is because of me," Vaught told the nursing board, starting to cry.

     Summary: NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A former Tennessee nurse is guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the death of a patient who was accidentally given the wrong medication, a jury found Friday.
RaDonda Vaught, 37, injected the paralyzing drug vecuronium into 75-year-old Charlene Murphey instead of the sedative Versed on Dec. 26, 2017.
Interviewed after the verdict, Vaught said she was relieved to have a resolution after 4 1/2 years and hopes Murphey’s family is relieved as well.
RaDonda Vaught had a duty of care to Charlene Murphey and RaDonda Vaught neglected that.
Vaught faces three to six years in prison on the gross neglect conviction and one to two years on the criminally negligent homicide conviction.
