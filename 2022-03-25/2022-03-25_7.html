     Denver Broncos stadium fire torches seats, suite area
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 of 6DENVER | Firefighters extinguished a blaze that torched several rows of seats and a suite area at the Denver Broncos’ stadium on Thursday.
Firefighters quickly brought the blaze under control but were trying to determine if it had spread to other areas of the football stadium, which seats 76,125 people.
At least 100 people were attending an event on the second level, but the stadium was otherwise empty.
The Denver Fire Department tweeted several photos showing large flames spreading through the seating area.
A welder’s torch was blamed for starting a similar fire that burned plastic seats in the west stands of the old Mile High Stadium in January 2002.

     Broncos stadium fire destroyed $60,000 worth of ticket value
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DENVER (KDVR) — Empower Field at Mile High is still standing, but Thursday’s fire left quite a lot of money’s worth of ticket sales destroyed.
The fire started in the northeast part of the stadium around 2:15 p.m. Thursday.
For the upcoming Red Hot Chili Peppers concert on July 23, these tickets sell for about $200 face value – meaning if they aren’t repaired the stadium will potentially lose $60,000 for that one show only.
For a lower-interest event like the upcoming Monster Jam on April 23, these seats sell for $45 at face value.
This would still mean the stadium is losing out on about $13,000 in just ticket prices.
