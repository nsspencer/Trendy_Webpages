     Chet Holmgren, Gonzaga doomed by horrible foul calls in March Madness 2022 loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chet Holmgren is likely going to play his next basketball game as a professional – perhaps as the No.
But his final college game was marred by two horrendous foul calls that forced him out early.
During Gonzaga’s 74-68 loss to Arkansas in the Sweet 16 of March Madness 2022, the seven-footer picked up two fouls in the first half, and his third early in the second.
If anything, it looked like Arkansas’ Au’Diese Toney could have been called for an offensive foul for attacking Holmgren’s chest.
But it was still called, forcing Holmgren to play safe for the rest of the game.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Gonzaga Bulldogs losing in the Sweet 16 to the Arkansas Razorbacks brought a devastating end to their season.
After the game, head coach Mark Few addressed the foul trouble that Chet Holmgren found himself in.
Not having his star freshman threw off the game plan, as Few was looking to balance the offensive workload between Holmgren and Drew Timme.
Chet Holmgren picks up his 5th and final foul of the Sweet 16.
Even with Holmgren’s foul trouble, they had a real shot at winning the game.

     N.C.A.A. Men’s Tournament: Gonzaga Falls Short Again as the Favorite
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — Top-ranked Gonzaga, which hoped to ride its high-flying offense to its first national championship, was stopped short of that goal with a 74-68 loss to No.
As their struggles intensified, the Zags pressed — fumbling passes, hurrying shots and wearing the frustration on their faces.
When Timme missed a layup after being fouled, he slapped his hands together in anger, knowing how precious each point would be.
Andrew Nembhard knocked in a 3-pointer with 16.5 seconds left to bring Gonzaga within 68-65, the closest the Zags had been since early in the second half.
But Arkansas made its free throws and Gonzaga never got the ball back with a chance to get even.

     How Arkansas brilliantly capitalized on poor NCAA officiating to knock Chet Holmgren, Gonzaga out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the refs just called yet another foul on Gonzaga’s Chet Holmgren.
"Getting Chet in foul trouble was a really big thing for us.
On the season, Gonzaga averaged 44.0 points per game in the paint while shooting 63.9% in that zone.
Gonzaga, led by head coach Mark Few, wasn’t forced to pull Holmgren once he got in foul trouble.
Arkansas was able to increase the minutes Holmgren was unavailable by repeatedly drawing contact so that he would have to sit with foul trouble, and the refs were buying every second of it.

     10 Observations From Gonzaga’s loss to Arkansas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 2. Credit Arkansas Coach Eric Musselman for successfully slowing down Andrew Nembhard, who’s been incredible, thus the Gonzaga offense.
Give credit to Arkansas for a good defensive performance but Gonzaga’s offense spent the entire year as one of, if not the most efficient in the nation.
If you would have told me before the game Gonzaga would outrebound Arkansas and shoot more free throws making a higher percentage, I’d have predicted an easy win.
In a Spokesman-Review article, Arkansas Coach Musselman talked about watching films of his games against Nembhard at Florida when he coached Nevada and his first year at Arkansas.
Add the season-ending to Dom Harris and you really need to appreciate how spectacular Nembhard and Bolton have been this year.
