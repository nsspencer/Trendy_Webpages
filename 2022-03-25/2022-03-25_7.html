     WWE Legend Triple H Announces His Retirement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WWE legend Triple H has announced his retirement from in-ring wrestling.
Speaking to Stephen A. Smith on ESPN's First Take, and shared in a tweet from the official WWE account (below), Triple H said his time in the ring was over.
The 14-time-world champion teased the retirement earlier today on his own Twitter account, saying he would be delivering an update on his health and future in the interview.
Triple H is considered one of the greatest wrestlers of all time, debuting in 1990 and gaining fame as a villain before co-founding the D-Generation X wrestling stable alongside Shawn Michaels, Chyna, and Rick Rude.
In addition to the 14 world titles, Triple H is also a five-time intercontinental champion, three-time tag team champion, two-time unified WWE tag team champion, and two-time European champion.

     Summary: (WTRF) – Wrestling legend Triple H has revealed that he never plans to enter the ring again.
In an emotional interview with ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith, Triple H confirmed that he’s retiring from in-ring activity after suffering a cardiac event last year.
Do you wake up from this?’ That’s tough to swallow,” said Triple H, choking up.
Triple H underwent a successful procedure at Yale New Haven Hospital following his cardiac event, which WWE said in September had been “caused by a genetic issue.” At the time, WWE added that Triple H was expected to make a full recovery.
When asked about his future in wrestling for ESPN’s interview, Triple H didn’t mince words.
