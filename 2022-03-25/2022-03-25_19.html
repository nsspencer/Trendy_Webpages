     Summary: BEIJING (Reuters) – China backs the Solomon Islands in upholding social order, a foreign ministry spokesman told reporters on Friday, when asked if the two were in talks on a security partnership.
Australia and New Zealand expressed concern about the impact on regional security of military cooperation between China and the Solomons after the leak of a draft document on proposed cooperation.
At a regular media briefing in Beijing, ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin did not confirm or deny the proposed cooperation when asked about it.

     Solomon Islands confirms proposed security deal with China
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Australia and New Zealand expressed concern on Friday about the impact on regional security of military cooperation between China and the Solomon Islands after a draft document outlining proposed cooperation was leaked.
The proposed security arrangements with China would cover humanitarian needs besides maintaining the rule of law, it added.
A security agreement with Australia, signed in 2017, would be preserved as Solomon Islands deepened relations with China, it said.
Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he had not spoken to his Solomon Islands counterpart in the 24 hours since news of the Pacific island’s security discussions with China were made public.
Australia and New Zealand were part of the “Pacific family” and talks were being held with Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, Morrison told reporters earlier Friday.

"We are the Solomon Islands' single largest development partner, daylight second, third, fourth," Morrison said.

On Thursday, a Solomon Islands official told Reuters a security deal with China covering the military would be sent to its cabinet for consideration.

     Summary: A Solomon Islands government statement said Friday that Honiara was in the process of "diversifying the country's security partnership including with China."
"We would be concerned, clearly, at any military base being established and we would express that to the Solomon Islands government," Dutton said.
Existing Australian tiesAustralia has an existing security agreement with the Solomon Islands, active since 2018, which allows Australian police, defense and civilian personnel to deploy rapidly to the islands in the event of security threats.
When asked about a relationship between China and the Solomon Islands on Thursday, Australia's Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews underscored the desire for stability.
"That is our backyard, that is our neighborhood, and we are very concerned about any activity that is taking place in the Pacific Islands.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A leaked draft security agreement being negotiated between China and Solomon Islands could have security implications for the whole Pacific.
The agreement also allows China, with the consent of Solomon Islands, to make ship visits, provide logistical support and have stopovers and transition in Solomon Islands.
Pacific Islands Forum members, including Australia, agreed in the 2018 Boe Declaration to address regional security challenges collectively.
Solomon Islands’ increasingly close ties with China since the switch of diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2019 remains a highly sensitive issue domestically.
Opposition politicians questioned how far Chinese security cooperation with Solomon Islands would go.

“That includes in the Pacific islands, because what happens here matters to the U.S.,” he said.
