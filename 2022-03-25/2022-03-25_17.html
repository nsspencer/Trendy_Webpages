     'Pachinko' offers a sweeping family saga that earns your tears
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) With the sweep of a historical epic and a format that focuses on one family across decades, "Pachinko" evokes memories of other ambitious TV sagas, perhaps foremost "Roots."
Yuh-Jung Youn as the older version of Sunja in 'Pachinko.'
With her poor family laboring under Japanese rule, Sunja quickly falls for Hansu (Lee Minho), whose pointed stares demonstrate that the feeling's mutual.
Written and produced by Soo Hugh ("The Terror"), with Kogonada and Justin Chon splitting directorial duties, "Pachinko" is peppered with heartbreaking situations and brilliant dialogue.
Later, when the older Sunja cries, a contemporary chides her grandson, saying, "Don't look down on her tears.

If you travel down to this village from Seoul, you really get to see this period of time preserved.

     ‘Pachinko’ Review: A Moving Journey Through Generational Trauma
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the reasons the book was so absorbing for so many was its linear structure, a largely chronological account of a family’s struggle over four generations, eight decades, three countries and multiple conflicts.
“The whole Koreans versus Japanese situation—why can’t people just get over that?” asks Solomon’s American boss ( Jimmi Simpson ).
But you won’t have to: “Pachinko” takes an often beautiful, artfully cinematic and languorous journey through the history of 20th-century Korea, and Koreans, in a tale that might impress Americans by being about immigration in which we’re not the villains.
The story’s timeliness vis-à-vis Ukraine isn’t insignificant, being as it is about a brutal regime reducing people to second-class citizens in their own country—and mistreating them when they emigrate.
In this case, an ever-shifting storyline is a deterrent to traction.

     Summary: But she starts to witness how the Japanese occupation of Korea affects people around her.
As a teenager, portrayed in an incredible breakout performance from Minha Kim, Sunja endures so much.
At this point, Sunja has lived a great deal of life, but now holds much of it in silence.
Throughout, Older Sunja flashes back to her previous life, with the time-hopping editing sometimes fading her youngest face into her older one, showing how these memories of longing have been preserved.
Sunja, one of the hundreds of thousands of Koreans who moved to Japan and became stateless, dreams of going back home.

     Apple TV’s Pachinko is an enthralling historical epic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The nonlinear construction of time in the Pachinko series marks a significant departure from Lee’s novel, which progresses chronologically, turning this adaptation into a radically different project.
One episode towards the later part of the series also takes a historical detour that feels particularly disjointed with the rest of the story.
He is unfazed by the “one landowner hold[ing] the entire deal hostage” — an elderly zainichi Korean lady, Grandmother Han.
In many ways, the enormity of the Pachinko series extends far beyond the small screens we watch it on.
In Pachinko, Apple has woven together an extraordinary project that will hopefully herald many more to come.

     ‘Pachinko,’ an epic of multigenerational loss, is hard to get lost in
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They and their descendants constitute the Zainichi, many of whom have faced lifelong discrimination that continues top this day.
The Korean Japanese dominate the pachinko industry, based on the popular manic pinball game with a proximity to gambling that has garnered parlor owners a seedy reputation.
“Pachinko” is a tale of movement and privation, of people so busy surviving that it isn’t until years later that they can fully process all they’ve lost.
Here’s where I’ll happily confess that “Pachinko” is one of my favorite novels of the past decade.
As is now de rigueur for biopics — but not period dramas — an epilogue showcases interviews with real-life Zainichi women who reflect on their own experiences.

     Summary: Sunja tells him that she’s pregnant, and initially, Koh Hansu seems elated.
While Isak is recuperating, Sunja finally tells her mother she’s pregnant but refuses to disclose the father’s identity.
Sunja bristles at the idea and tells Isak she’s prepared to live as an outcast because she was loved by an outcast.
The woman asks Sunja if she’s been back to Korea since she immigrated, and Sunja responds that she hasn’t.
Sunja’s mother lifts a piece of food out of her bowl and puts it into Sunja’s bowl.
