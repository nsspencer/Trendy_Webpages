     Summary: Photo: NetflixBridgerton season two has arrived, and it brings me no pleasure (wink, wink) to tell you it is significantly less steamy than the first.
Note: Spoilers for season two ahead, though the biggest spoiler of the season is … no horny :(There is a Hot Duke–shaped hole missing from the ton since Regé-Jean Page’s departure.
There are a couple of — how should I say this … climactic scenes toward the end of season two.
It pulled a reverse Magic Mike with the follow-up being significant less horny than the original.

     Bridgerton Is Returning for Season 3—And Shonda Rhimes Just Teased a Major Spoiler!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “From the first time I read Julia Quinn’s delicious Bridgerton series, I knew these were stories that would captivate a viewing audience.
Season 2 of Bridgerton premiered on Friday, March 25, 2022, but no release date for Season 3 has been announced.
Are there any Bridgerton Season 3 spoilers?
That still leaves six more Bridgerton siblings: Benedict, Colin, Eloise, Hyacinth, Gregory and Francesca.
But now, spinning in the strong arms of the debonair and devastatingly handsome Benedict Bridgerton, she feels like royalty.

     Bridgerton Recap: Love Languages
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As discerning as Kate is, it seems her only hard-and-fast rule is that a candidate can’t be Anthony Bridgerton.
Defending her omission of the viscount, Kate says he doesn’t believe in love and is only seeking a wife out of duty.
Anthony rallies up the Bridgerton clan to attend the races with him, mainly so he can humblebrag to Edwina about his close-knit family.
Instead of feeling sorry for her son, Lady Bridgerton points out that if he wasn’t so loud about his disdain for love, maybe he’d be invited, too.
Anthony begs his creative brother to play Cyrano and compose a love poem that he can play off as his own.
