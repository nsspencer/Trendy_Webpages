     N.C.A.A. Men’s Tournament: Gonzaga Falls Short Again as the Favorite
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — Top-ranked Gonzaga, which hoped to ride its high-flying offense to its first national championship, was stopped short of that goal with a 74-68 loss to No.
As their struggles intensified, the Zags pressed — fumbling passes, hurrying shots and wearing the frustration on their faces.
When Timme missed a layup after being fouled, he slapped his hands together in anger, knowing how precious each point would be.
Andrew Nembhard knocked in a 3-pointer with 16.5 seconds left to bring Gonzaga within 68-65, the closest the Zags had been since early in the second half.
But Arkansas made its free throws and Gonzaga never got the ball back with a chance to get even.

     One Woman's Quest to Stop Killings of Wild Horses in Arizona
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The most recent shootings that anyone knows of were in late December, when three dead wild horses were found.
Wild horses are federally protected, and killing one on public land is punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971.
It didn’t take long for her to discover the wild horses, which would appear silently and suddenly as she hiked in the woods.
The history of wild horses in AmericaConquistadores brought wild horses, originally known as mustangs, from Spain in the 1500s.
Today’s wild horses in Arizona may be descendants of the Spanish mustangs, but many have bred with ranch and farm horses.
