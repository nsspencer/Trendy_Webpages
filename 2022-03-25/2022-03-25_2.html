     Pop Covers in Bridgerton Season 2 Scenes &amp; Timestamps
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you listened to the Vitamin String Quartet's instrumental cover of "thank u, next" by Ariana Grande from season one of Bridgerton on repeat, you're not alone.
The six pop covers in the first season of the Regency romance were such a hit that there was no question there would be a new line-up of incredible instrumental covers in season two.
Each one is incredibly powerful and deeply emotional in its own special way," Bridgerton showrunner Chris Van Dusen told Netflix's Tudum publication.
"I always try many different songs for any one scene before landing on the perfect one to use.
Here are the 10 pop songs that appear in Bridgerton season two—and the time-stamped moments you can hear them.

     Bridgerton Season 2 Ending Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The second epilogue takes place beginning two days before Anthony’s birthday and it’s all about the lead-up to the annual Bridgerton family Pall Mall match plus the game itself.
The game itself is the usual Bridgerton family battle of wit, wills, and occasional cheating to get the upper hand or possession of the Mallet of Death.
Bridgerton Season 2’s final scene shifts the timeline of the annual Pall Mall game to shortly after Kate and Anthony are officially married.
Anthony believes he truly fell in love with Kate during the Pall Mall game.
Fans of the novels may often dispute Bridgerton adaptation choices but it’s clear the epilogues will be shown in some form to end each season.

     On “Bridgerton" Season 2, Brownness, and the Intimacy of Cultural Tradition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In this op-ed, writer Vandana Pawa analyzes Bridgerton season 2 and how the impactful moments of intimacy between the Sharmas are informed by cultural traditions.
In Bridgerton season 2, newcomer and diamond of the season Edwina Sharma refers to her sister Kate as “didi,” the Hindi word for “older sister,” and the only thing I’ve ever called my own sister since I learned how to talk.
The first time Edwina uttered it on screen, casually sprinkled within a conversation otherwise spoken in English, I gasped.
Despite being an honorific of sorts, in my experience, “didi” implies a connection that can only come with the intimacy of sisterhood.
The Sharmas are the focal point of Bridgerton season 2, with British Indian actresses Simone and Charithra at the helm.

     Where Did All the Sex Go In Bridgerton Season 2?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bridgerton season one was the period piece manifestation of the well-worn maxim “a lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets.” Yet Bridgerton’s second season, which hits Netflix today, has almost completely done away with the sex that defined the first season—much to its detriment.
And as a result, season one’s three-minute long sex montages have been traded for hushed whispers in gardens.
Bridgerton’s first season fit more squarely in this narrative, with Bustle going so far as to rank the show’s sex scenes based on how much of Page’s butt we could see at any given time.
But by design, this season was always more about the sexiness of restraint than the sexiness of, well, sex.
While some may appreciate the purity and prudity of season two, many will find that Bridgerton didn’t turn up the heat until the bitter end.

     Bridgerton Recap: Do Not Stop
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meanwhile, Eloise, who skipped the excursion, is bouncing out the door to go “shopping.” But someone’s waiting for her outside the Bridgerton family home: the queen!
After their alienating promenade, the Sharmas, Anthony, and Lady Bridgerton convene at Lady Danbury’s to brainstorm how they might turn their blacklisting around: by having a ball!
Art featuring the Bridgerton family crest is freshly painted on the floor.
Lady Bridgerton asks their housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, if she knows why no guests came, and she brandishes the latest Whistledown issue, hot off the press.
And then he pulls his head back, shakes it, and says to her, “You have to stop.” (ANTHONY FICTIONAL CHARACTER BRIDGERTON, I SWEAR TO GOD.)
