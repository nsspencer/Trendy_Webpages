     Pop Covers in Bridgerton Season 2 Scenes &amp; Timestamps
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you listened to the Vitamin String Quartet's instrumental cover of "thank u, next" by Ariana Grande from season one of Bridgerton on repeat, you're not alone.
The six pop covers in the first season of the Regency romance were such a hit that there was no question there would be a new line-up of incredible instrumental covers in season two.
Each one is incredibly powerful and deeply emotional in its own special way," Bridgerton showrunner Chris Van Dusen told Netflix's Tudum publication.
"I always try many different songs for any one scene before landing on the perfect one to use.
Here are the 10 pop songs that appear in Bridgerton season two—and the time-stamped moments you can hear them.

     Bridgerton Season 2 Ending Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The second epilogue takes place beginning two days before Anthony’s birthday and it’s all about the lead-up to the annual Bridgerton family Pall Mall match plus the game itself.
The game itself is the usual Bridgerton family battle of wit, wills, and occasional cheating to get the upper hand or possession of the Mallet of Death.
Bridgerton Season 2’s final scene shifts the timeline of the annual Pall Mall game to shortly after Kate and Anthony are officially married.
Anthony believes he truly fell in love with Kate during the Pall Mall game.
Fans of the novels may often dispute Bridgerton adaptation choices but it’s clear the epilogues will be shown in some form to end each season.

     Which season of ‘Bridgerton’ is better? We fight it out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was always going to be hard for “Bridgerton” to top the bonkers lightning-in-a-bottle of Season 1, especially given Page’s departure from the series.
Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington and Claudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton in “Bridgerton.” (Liam Daniel/Netflix)Lee: Ha!
Mostly I’m eager to skip ahead and see how things turn out for Eloise, the Bridgerton I’m most invested in.
Lee: Here’s hoping “Bridgerton” gets renewed through Season 5, as the fifth book is all about Eloise!
She knows what her readers want, so when it’s her turn to take center stage, “Bridgerton” better not disappoint.

     Summary: But will Eloise (Claudia Jessie) and Lord Anthony (Jonathan Bailey) succeed in their season goals — respectively, to keep away from all potential suitors and to win over the diamond of the season?
The true protagonists of the season aren’t Eloise and the Featheringtons, however, but Anthony and Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley).
Image via NetflixThings begin to change for Lord Anthony when he sees a young woman running through the country on horseback.
Only one thing can put an end to all this unsavory gossip: Lady Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) announcing loud and clear that her son, the viscount, is looking for a wife.
But Kate isn’t having it: as soon as she sees her sister dancing with Lord Bridgerton, she pulls her aside for a little chat.

     Summary: Meanwhile, Eloise, who skipped the excursion, is bouncing out the door to go “shopping.” But someone’s waiting for her outside the Bridgerton family home: the queen!
After their alienating promenade, the Sharmas, Anthony, and Lady Bridgerton convene at Lady Danbury’s to brainstorm how they might turn their blacklisting around: by having a ball!
Art featuring the Bridgerton family crest is freshly painted on the floor.
Lady Bridgerton asks their housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, if she knows why no guests came, and she brandishes the latest Whistledown issue, hot off the press.
And then he pulls his head back, shakes it, and says to her, “You have to stop.” (ANTHONY FICTIONAL CHARACTER BRIDGERTON, I SWEAR TO GOD.)
