     Bridgerton Season 2 Builds The Brand Of Racially Diverse Regency Drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unfortunately for Kate not only does her little corgi Newton seem to like Anthony, but her disdain morphs into desire.
Anthony isn’t the only Bridgerton sibling with drama in their life.
Outside of the Bridgerton and Sharma households, there’s a lot more drama based on existing storylines and new ones.
The best change Season 2 makes is to delay the reveal of why Anthony’s father passed away a decade earlier.
Episode 3’s integration of the flashbacks with Anthony’s increasingly clear attraction to Kate complicating his life plans is incredibly well done.

     Summary: It was always going to be hard for “Bridgerton” to top the bonkers lightning-in-a-bottle of Season 1, especially given Page’s departure from the series.
Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington and Claudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton in “Bridgerton.” (Liam Daniel/Netflix)Lee: Ha!
Mostly I’m eager to skip ahead and see how things turn out for Eloise, the Bridgerton I’m most invested in.
Lee: Here’s hoping “Bridgerton” gets renewed through Season 5, as the fifth book is all about Eloise!
She knows what her readers want, so when it’s her turn to take center stage, “Bridgerton” better not disappoint.

     Summary: But will Eloise (Claudia Jessie) and Lord Anthony (Jonathan Bailey) succeed in their season goals — respectively, to keep away from all potential suitors and to win over the diamond of the season?
The true protagonists of the season aren’t Eloise and the Featheringtons, however, but Anthony and Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley).
Image via NetflixThings begin to change for Lord Anthony when he sees a young woman running through the country on horseback.
Only one thing can put an end to all this unsavory gossip: Lady Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) announcing loud and clear that her son, the viscount, is looking for a wife.
But Kate isn’t having it: as soon as she sees her sister dancing with Lord Bridgerton, she pulls her aside for a little chat.
