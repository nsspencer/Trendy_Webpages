     Eagles' Jalen Hurts out vs. Cowboys; Gardner Minshew to start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eagles coach Nick Sirianni says it looks like Gardner Minshew will get the start Saturday vs. the Cowboys.
(1:05)PHILADELPHIA -- Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts will miss Saturday's game against the Dallas Cowboys with a right shoulder sprain, meaning Gardner Minshew will get the start in a game that could secure the NFC East title and the No.
"Jalen did everything he possibly could to get his body ready to go," coach Nick Sirianni said Thursday.
"Gardner will be our guy and Gardner will be ready," Sirianni said.
Minshew has performed well in spot duty for the Eagles before, going 20-of-25 and throwing a pair of touchdowns for an injured Hurts last December against the Jets.

     How the Eagles can win with Gardner Minshew at quarterback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 Philadelphia Eagles NFL’s best team.
The offensive line is the NFL’s best, and it isn’t particularly close.
And third-year quarterback Jalen Hurts has gone from a big maybe in 2021, to unquestioned franchise quarterback in 2022.
In 2021, his first season with the Eagles, Minshew completed 41 of 60 passes for 469 yards, four touchdowns, one interception, and a passer rating of 104.8.
He might have starter potential on a team with a less-defined quarterback situation, and he’s one of the NFL’s best backups, so that’s nice.

"He's been here for awhile, so if he's the guy we'll be ready to go," center Jason Kelce said earlier in the week of Minshew.
He'll be the quarterback the Eagles know he is, and that's plenty good enough to win important games.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That's because Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said Thursday that starting quarterback Jalen Hurts, who's having an MVP-caliber season, won't play because of a sprained shoulder suffered last Sunday against the Chicago Bears.
Gardner Minshew will replace him, and it's possible that Minshew could start the remaining three games of the regular season.
1 seed, their first playoff game wouldn't be until the weekend of Jan. 21.
Hurts had sprained his ankle the week before, so Minshew led the Eagles to a 33-18 win over the Jets.
The Eagles had already clinched a playoff berth by then, so they decided to rest Hurts for the playoffs.
