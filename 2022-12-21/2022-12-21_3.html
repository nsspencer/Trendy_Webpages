     Trump tax audit: Former president's returns will be made public
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2020, the New York Times obtained leaked copies of 18 years of Mr Trump's tax returns.
In a series of articles on the topic, the newspaper reported that the president paid no federal taxes in 10 of those 18 years and only $750 (£615) in each of his first two years in the White House.
It also disclosed that the then-president was in a fight with the Internal Revenue Service over the legitimacy of a $72.9m tax refund he had claimed and owed more than $400m in debt due by 2024.

     Trump tax returns: House committee to release 6 years of ex-president's taxes

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThe Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee voted Tuesday to publicly release six years of former President Donald Trump's tax returns.
Driving the news: It's not immediately clear how quickly the House committee will release the returns, which would provide details on some of his tax payments, financial obligations and donations to charity.
The Supreme Court ruled against Trump, paving the way for the House committee to gain access to the tax returns after it denied Trump's emergency application.
asked for access to six years of Trump's tax returns and some of his businesses.
"If they are so hell-bent on releasing President Trump's tax returns — which show he built a very successful business and created numerous lucrative assets throughout his career — they should release the tax returns of Nancy Pelosi," Cheung added.

     IRS failed to conduct timely mandatory audits of Trump’s taxes while president
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new report suggests US tax authorities only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings in 2019, more than two years into his presidency.
The audit, a requirement dating back to the Nixon administration, came only after Democrats took control of the House and requested Trump’s tax information.
Trump’s tax records amount to thousands of pages and may take days to be made public as the committee works to redacted sensitive details.
The dispute over Trump’s tax returns speaks to a larger fight over the IRS.
Democrats argue it is ill-equipped to audit high-income, complex tax returns, and instead targets filers in lower-income brackets.

     Trump's tax returns show he paid no taxes in 2020, committee says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee voted Tuesday to make public some documents related to former President Donald Trump's tax returns -- a move Trump has long fought.
The committee met for several hours behind closed doors Tuesday afternoon and then returned to vote 24-16 in open session to release the information related to Trump's tax returns from 2015-2020.
The tax returns will cover six years, from 2015 to 2020, Neal later said.
Neal told reporters that the committee found there was no ongoing audit of Trump's tax returns during his presidency until the committee requested them, despite an IRS requirement that tax returns filed by a sitting president or vice president are subject to audit.
"Going forward, partisans in Congress have nearly unlimited power to target political enemies by obtaining and making public their private tax returns to embarrass and destroy them.

     Mandatory IRS audit of Trump taxes delayed during presidency, House panel says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The IRS only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings on April 3, 2019, more than two years into Trump’s presidency and just months after Democrats took control of the House.
That date coincides with Rep. Richard Neal, the panel chairman, asking the IRS for information related to Trump’s tax returns.
“I would love to give them, but I’m not going to do it while I’m under audit,” Trump said on April 10, 2019, before boarding the presidential helicopter.
The New York Times found that before he entered the White House, Trump was facing an IRS audit potentially tied to a $72.9 million tax refund arising from $700 million in losses he claimed in 2009.
Trump has argued there is little to learn from his tax returns even as he has fought to keep them private.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “There were no audits in a timely manner,” Ways and Means Committee chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.)
“Not surprising,” Steve Rosenthal, an analyst with the Tax Policy Center who has testified to Congress about Trump’s tax returns, said in an interview about those audits remaining incomplete.
On the same day, the IRS initiated its first audit of Donald Trump’s tax returns,” Beyer wrote.
“Donald Trump’s tax returns exemplify the shortcomings of our tax code,” Wyden said Wednesday.
“I won’t speculate on what the next Congress and this committee will focus on related to tax returns,” he said.
