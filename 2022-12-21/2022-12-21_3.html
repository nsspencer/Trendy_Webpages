     Trump tax returns: House committee to release 6 years of ex-president's taxes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThe Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee voted Tuesday to publicly release six years of former President Donald Trump's tax returns.
Driving the news: It's not immediately clear how quickly the House committee will release the returns, which would provide details on some of his tax payments, financial obligations and donations to charity.
The Supreme Court ruled against Trump, paving the way for the House committee to gain access to the tax returns after it denied Trump's emergency application.
asked for access to six years of Trump's tax returns and some of his businesses.
"If they are so hell-bent on releasing President Trump's tax returns — which show he built a very successful business and created numerous lucrative assets throughout his career — they should release the tax returns of Nancy Pelosi," Cheung added.

     Trump tax returns will go public soon after committee Democrats vote to release them
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A House committee voted to release Donald Trump’s tax information to the public, capping a three-year legal saga initiated by Democrats to obtain and release the former president’s closely held financial documents.
The panel, which has an eight-seat Democratic majority, agreed on a party-line vote to release information from Trump’s personal and business tax returns from 2015 to 2020.
He said the meager review of Trump’s tax returns is indicative of a larger problem at the agency where there aren’t enough resources and specialized tax auditors to examine the finances of wealthy Americans.
There is no law that prevents tax returns under audit from being made public.
The tax returns have been very closely held because releasing tax information without authorization is a felony punishable by prison time.

     The IRS is accused of doing a half-baked job of auditing Trump’s controversial tax returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Donald Trump’s tax missteps during his presidency are being laid bare for the world to see.
After a years-long court battle, earlier this month the House Committee on Ways and Means finally got access to six years of the former president’s tax returns, from 2015 to 2021.
The findings helped validate concerns that the White House may have pressured IRS agents to go easy on Trump’s returns.
A brief history of the IRS Mandatory Audit ProgramThe IRS Mandatory Audit Program is an internal policy adopted in 1997 that’s meant to ensure the annual audit of the president and vice-president.
The publication of his tax returns is only one of the unflattering spotlights pointed at Trump.

     IRS failed to conduct timely mandatory audits of Trump’s taxes while president
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The IRS only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings on 3 April 2019, more than two years into his presidency and months after Democrats took the House.
That date coincides with Richard Neal, the panel chairman, asking the IRS for information related to Trump’s tax returns.
“We must express disagreement with the decision not to engage any specialists when facing returns with a high degree of complexity,” the tax committee said.
“I would love to give them, but I’m not going to do it while I’m under audit,” Trump said on 10 April 2019.
Democrats argue the IRS is ill-equipped to audit high-income, complex tax returns, and instead targets filers in lower-income brackets.

     IRS failed to audit Trump's taxes during his presidency, despite mandatory program, committee says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ways and Means Committee voted to release some of Trump's tax documents.
Neal told reporters that the committee found there was no ongoing audit of Trump's tax returns during his presidency until the committee requested them, despite an IRS requirement that tax returns filed by a sitting president or vice president are subject to audit.
Before the committee met, multiple boxes of Trump tax return-related documents were seen being wheeled into the room.
The committee had requested six years' worth of Trump's returns as part of what it said was an investigation into IRS audit practices of presidents and vice presidents.
In his petition to the Supreme Court, Trump accused the committee of seeking his taxes under false pretenses.

     House committee votes to make public Donald Trump's tax records and criticizes IRS for lack of mandatory audits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House Ways and Means Committee voted Tuesday to make six years of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns public — potentially ending years of speculation about what they might reveal about his business dealings and personal wealth.
The committee report listed several overarching issues it believed the IRS should have investigated but did not.
It is the power to embarrass, harass or destroy a private citizen through disclosure of their tax returns," Brady said.
Trump was the first president to refuse to make his tax returns public since the 1970s.
In both the year he won the presidency and his first year in office, he paid only $750 in federal income tax, the newspaper found.
