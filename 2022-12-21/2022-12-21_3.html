    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having won six in a row on the way to a 19-12 record and an ascension up the Eastern Conference ladder, the Nets continued rolling against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday.
Kevin Durant and Co. led the way as Brooklyn seized a 91-51 advantage at halftime, which marked their most points scored in the first half in franchise history.
The Nets put up 91 points in the 1st half of their game against the Warriors tonight.
That is the 3rd-highest 1st half point total in NBA history.
But it was James Wiseman who led Golden State in scoring at halftime, logging 17 points on a perfect 7-for-7 shooting clip off the bench.

     Kevin Durant Calls For Nets vs. Knicks Christmas Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After playing the Boston Celtics in 2020 and the Los Angeles Lakers in 2021, the Brooklyn Nets were left off the biggest day of regular season hoops this year: Christmas Day.
"Knicks-Nets would've been a great Christmas Day game, especially with the way the Knicks have been playing and the way we’re playing right now.
I felt like that would’ve been the perfect matchup on Christmas," said Durant on which team he'd like to play on Christmas Day.
But in terms of playing the Nets in recent years, the Knicks haven't been able to do that in quite some time.
Although the Nets will be watching the five-game Christmas Day slate from home, the Knicks will host the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden.

     Nets make history with 91-point first-half explosion vs. Warriors as they claim seventh straight victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Durant will forever be tied to the Golden State Warriors after winning two championships with them, but on Wednesday, he and his Brooklyn Nets laid a historic beating on his former team.
The 91 points Brooklyn scored are the third most any team has scored in a first half in league history.
All-Star guard Kyrie Irving did not even play against Golden State, and the Nets still walloped the admittedly depleted Warriors.
The Nets have now won seven games in a row and 10 or their last 11.
With Golden State winning the title last year and the Nets competing for it while Golden State languished in the lottery the year prior, It seems as though Durant and the Warriors are incapable of succeeding at the same time.

     Summary: The banged-up Warriors were without several top players Wednesday night at Barclays Center, but Kyrie Irving also was sidelined for the Nets with right-calf tightness.
The lone game he missed was the game the Nets won at Indiana on Dec. 10 despite sitting eight rotation regulars, also including Kevin Durant.
Kyrie Irving did not play in the Nets’ 143-113 win over the Warriors because of right-calf tightness.
Kevin Durant, who scored 23 points, shoots a fadeaway jumper during the Nets’ blowout win.
… Joe Harris moved back into the starting lineup to replace Irving and had 11 points in 19 minutes.

     Summary: Kevin Durant feels as though the Brooklyn Nets have unfairly garnered negative media attention this season.
Whether it was Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons or Steve Nash, there was plenty of headline-worthy news coming from the Nets.
Before the Nets took the floor Wednesday, Durant vocalized his latest grip with the media.
“I don’t see that standard for other teams,” Durant said, according to Yahoo Sports.
We gotta work for that.”Granted, New York — as Durant noted — is among the highest-intensity markets for sports.

     Summary: NEW YORK — (AP) — Jacque Vaughn wasn't aware his Brooklyn Nets had the best first half in their history.
“It’s the Warriors," Durant said.
Coach Steve Kerr said the Warriors' early turnovers — they finished with 21 that led to 36 points — helped the Nets get going.
The Warriors scored the next seven in one of their only highlights of the night before Brooklyn extended it to 91-51 at the half on Durant's 3-pointer.
Nets: Brooklyn has won 11 of its last 12 games.

     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa · 2 min readKevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets may be one of the most talented teams in the NBA right now, but they won’t be playing on Christmas day.
“I probably am responsible for us not playing on Christmas, with what went on this summer.
We play on the 26th, that’s close enough,” Durant said of the Christmas day snub, per Brian Mahoney of Associated Press.
It’s such a shame that the Nets won’t be playing on Christmas, though.
The Nets have quickly moved on from their horrific start to the campaign and have started playing to their full potential.

     Summary: Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant has been on quite a scoring tear lately.
After scoring 23 points in the Nets’ 143-113 blowout win over the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, he is now up to 11 straight games of shooting over 50% from the field.
Durant and the Nets have been trying to be better in putting away overmatched teams early and to their credit, they did that in this game.
Durant spoke postgame about how he loves when Vaughn calls those early timeouts and what Vaughn says during those stoppages:“Just lock back in.
Keeps us on point, keeps the coaching staff and everyone on point.”Kevin Durant has been locked in as of late.
