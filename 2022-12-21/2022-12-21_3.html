     Trump tax returns: House committee to release 6 years of ex-president's taxes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThe Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee voted Tuesday to publicly release six years of former President Donald Trump's tax returns.
Driving the news: It's not immediately clear how quickly the House committee will release the returns, which would provide details on some of his tax payments, financial obligations and donations to charity.
The Supreme Court ruled against Trump, paving the way for the House committee to gain access to the tax returns after it denied Trump's emergency application.
asked for access to six years of Trump's tax returns and some of his businesses.
"If they are so hell-bent on releasing President Trump's tax returns — which show he built a very successful business and created numerous lucrative assets throughout his career — they should release the tax returns of Nancy Pelosi," Cheung added.

     Trump tax returns: House committee report shows IRS failed to conduct 'mandatory' audits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The IRS failed to audit former President Donald Trump's federal tax returns for his first two years in the White House, even though an IRS program states the returns are "subject to mandatory review," a newly released House committee report disclosed.
Trump filed tax returns in 2017 for the prior two tax years.
And the tax agency started its audit on the same day the House Ways and Means Committee sought Trump's tax returns and related audits, the report said.
An internal IRS memo cited "some animosity" between an IRS counsel and one of Trump's tax attorneys.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareSometime soon — possibly within the next few days — a congressional committee led by Democrats will begin doling out former President Donald Trump’s income tax returns to the public.
And one of the reports shows that a mandatory audit of Trump’s returns only occurred in one of the six tax years that should have been scrutinized.
The IRS instituted mandated audits of presidential tax returns in 1977 in response to a tax scandal that ensnared former President Richard Nixon.
I saw Trump’s federal tax returns about 15 years ago as part of a legal action in which he unsuccessfully sued me for libel for a biography I wrote (the suit was later dismissed).

     Mandatory IRS audit of Trump taxes delayed during presidency, House panel says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The IRS only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings on April 3, 2019, more than two years into Trump’s presidency and just months after Democrats took control of the House.
That date coincides with Rep. Richard Neal, the panel chairman, asking the IRS for information related to Trump’s tax returns.
“I would love to give them, but I’m not going to do it while I’m under audit,” Trump said on April 10, 2019, before boarding the presidential helicopter.
The New York Times found that before he entered the White House, Trump was facing an IRS audit potentially tied to a $72.9 million tax refund arising from $700 million in losses he claimed in 2009.
Trump has argued there is little to learn from his tax returns even as he has fought to keep them private.

     House committee votes to make public Donald Trump's tax records and criticizes IRS for lack of mandatory audits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House Ways and Means Committee voted Tuesday to make six years of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns public — potentially ending years of speculation about what they might reveal about his business dealings and personal wealth.
The committee report listed several overarching issues it believed the IRS should have investigated but did not.
It is the power to embarrass, harass or destroy a private citizen through disclosure of their tax returns," Brady said.
Trump was the first president to refuse to make his tax returns public since the 1970s.
In both the year he won the presidency and his first year in office, he paid only $750 in federal income tax, the newspaper found.

     Trump paid no federal income tax in his last year as president
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trump repeatedly defied convention and refused to release his tax returns both as a presidential candidate and as a sitting president.
Trump paid a combined $1.1 million in federal income taxes in 2018 and 2019, a stark contrast to the $750 he paid in 2017 and $0 in 2020.
However, in 2020, Trump reported losses of over $16 million, large enough to reduce his federal income tax bill that year to $0.
Trump, again, had no taxable income in either year, but he was able to carry forward the deduction to future years, further limiting the amount of federal income tax he had to pay.
Trump’s trust has ownership of various pass-through entities, the income and deductions of which flow to Trump’s federal income tax return.
