    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having won six in a row on the way to a 19-12 record and an ascension up the Eastern Conference ladder, the Nets continued rolling against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday.
Kevin Durant and Co. led the way as Brooklyn seized a 91-51 advantage at halftime, which marked their most points scored in the first half in franchise history.
The Nets put up 91 points in the 1st half of their game against the Warriors tonight.
That is the 3rd-highest 1st half point total in NBA history.
But it was James Wiseman who led Golden State in scoring at halftime, logging 17 points on a perfect 7-for-7 shooting clip off the bench.

     Nets’ Kyrie Irving sidelined with right-calf tightness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The banged-up Warriors were without several top players Wednesday night at Barclays Center, but Kyrie Irving also was sidelined for the Nets with right-calf tightness.
The lone game he missed was the game the Nets won at Indiana on Dec. 10 despite sitting eight rotation regulars, also including Kevin Durant.
Kyrie Irving did not play in the Nets’ 143-113 win over the Warriors because of right-calf tightness.
Kevin Durant, who scored 23 points, shoots a fadeaway jumper during the Nets’ blowout win.
… Joe Harris moved back into the starting lineup to replace Irving and had 11 points in 19 minutes.

     Nets make history with 91-point first-half explosion vs. Warriors as they claim seventh straight victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Durant will forever be tied to the Golden State Warriors after winning two championships with them, but on Wednesday, he and his Brooklyn Nets laid a historic beating on his former team.
The 91 points Brooklyn scored are the third most any team has scored in a first half in league history.
All-Star guard Kyrie Irving did not even play against Golden State, and the Nets still walloped the admittedly depleted Warriors.
The Nets have now won seven games in a row and 10 or their last 11.
With Golden State winning the title last year and the Nets competing for it while Golden State languished in the lottery the year prior, It seems as though Durant and the Warriors are incapable of succeeding at the same time.

     Summary: NEW YORK — (AP) — Jacque Vaughn wasn't aware his Brooklyn Nets had the best first half in their history.
“It’s the Warriors," Durant said.
Coach Steve Kerr said the Warriors' early turnovers — they finished with 21 that led to 36 points — helped the Nets get going.
The Warriors scored the next seven in one of their only highlights of the night before Brooklyn extended it to 91-51 at the half on Durant's 3-pointer.
Nets: Brooklyn has won 11 of its last 12 games.
