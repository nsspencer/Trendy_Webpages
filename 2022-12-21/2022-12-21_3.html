     Trump tax returns: House committee to release 6 years of ex-president's taxes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThe Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee voted Tuesday to publicly release six years of former President Donald Trump's tax returns.
Driving the news: It's not immediately clear how quickly the House committee will release the returns, which would provide details on some of his tax payments, financial obligations and donations to charity.
The Supreme Court ruled against Trump, paving the way for the House committee to gain access to the tax returns after it denied Trump's emergency application.
asked for access to six years of Trump's tax returns and some of his businesses.
"If they are so hell-bent on releasing President Trump's tax returns — which show he built a very successful business and created numerous lucrative assets throughout his career — they should release the tax returns of Nancy Pelosi," Cheung added.

    </h2>

     Summary: Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareSometime soon — possibly within the next few days — a congressional committee led by Democrats will begin doling out former President Donald Trump’s income tax returns to the public.
And one of the reports shows that a mandatory audit of Trump’s returns only occurred in one of the six tax years that should have been scrutinized.
The IRS instituted mandated audits of presidential tax returns in 1977 in response to a tax scandal that ensnared former President Richard Nixon.
I saw Trump’s federal tax returns about 15 years ago as part of a legal action in which he unsuccessfully sued me for libel for a biography I wrote (the suit was later dismissed).

     IRS failed to conduct timely mandatory audits of Trump’s taxes while president
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The IRS only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings on 3 April 2019, more than two years into his presidency and months after Democrats took the House.
That date coincides with Richard Neal, the panel chairman, asking the IRS for information related to Trump’s tax returns.
“We must express disagreement with the decision not to engage any specialists when facing returns with a high degree of complexity,” the tax committee said.
“I would love to give them, but I’m not going to do it while I’m under audit,” Trump said on 10 April 2019.
Democrats argue the IRS is ill-equipped to audit high-income, complex tax returns, and instead targets filers in lower-income brackets.

     Trump's tax returns show he paid no taxes in 2020, committee says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee voted Tuesday to make public some documents related to former President Donald Trump's tax returns -- a move Trump has long fought.
The committee met for several hours behind closed doors Tuesday afternoon and then returned to vote 24-16 in open session to release the information related to Trump's tax returns from 2015-2020.
The tax returns will cover six years, from 2015 to 2020, Neal later said.
Neal told reporters that the committee found there was no ongoing audit of Trump's tax returns during his presidency until the committee requested them, despite an IRS requirement that tax returns filed by a sitting president or vice president are subject to audit.
"Going forward, partisans in Congress have nearly unlimited power to target political enemies by obtaining and making public their private tax returns to embarrass and destroy them.

“I would love to give them, but I’m not going to do it while I’m under audit,” Trump said on April 10, 2019, before boarding the presidential helicopter.
The New York Times found that before he entered the White House, Trump was facing an IRS audit potentially tied to a $72.9 million tax refund arising from $700 million in losses he claimed in 2009.
Trump has argued there is little to learn from his tax returns even as he has fought to keep them private.

     House committee votes to make public Donald Trump's tax records and criticizes IRS for lack of mandatory audits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House Ways and Means Committee voted Tuesday to make six years of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns public — potentially ending years of speculation about what they might reveal about his business dealings and personal wealth.
The committee report listed several overarching issues it believed the IRS should have investigated but did not.
It is the power to embarrass, harass or destroy a private citizen through disclosure of their tax returns," Brady said.
Trump was the first president to refuse to make his tax returns public since the 1970s.
In both the year he won the presidency and his first year in office, he paid only $750 in federal income tax, the newspaper found.
