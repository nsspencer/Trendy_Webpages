     Summary: Having won six in a row on the way to a 19-12 record and an ascension up the Eastern Conference ladder, the Nets continued rolling against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday.
Kevin Durant and Co. led the way as Brooklyn seized a 91-51 advantage at halftime, which marked their most points scored in the first half in franchise history.
The Nets put up 91 points in the 1st half of their game against the Warriors tonight.
That is the 3rd-highest 1st half point total in NBA history.
But it was James Wiseman who led Golden State in scoring at halftime, logging 17 points on a perfect 7-for-7 shooting clip off the bench.

Phoenix set the NBA record with 107 points in the first half against Denver on Nov. 10, 1990.
The Nets led 46-17 after one quarter, a 29-point difference that was the biggest in any quarter in the league this season.

     Summary: BROOKLYN — The Nets had locked up Wednesday’s game with the Golden State Warriors a few minutes after the game started.
The Nets scored 91 first-half points on their way to a 143-113 win over the Warriors on Wednesday.
The victory extended the Nets’ season-high winning streak to seven games.
The Nets took advantage of a depleted Warriors team that was without Steph Curry, Andrew Wiggins and Klay Thompson.
Brooklyn had 10 players make at least one three-pointer during the win and the Nets’ 21 threes was a season-high for the team.

     Nets make history with 91-point first-half explosion vs. Warriors as they claim seventh straight victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin Durant will forever be tied to the Golden State Warriors after winning two championships with them, but on Wednesday, he and his Brooklyn Nets laid a historic beating on his former team.
The 91 points Brooklyn scored are the third most any team has scored in a first half in league history.
All-Star guard Kyrie Irving did not even play against Golden State, and the Nets still walloped the admittedly depleted Warriors.
The Nets have now won seven games in a row and 10 or their last 11.
With Golden State winning the title last year and the Nets competing for it while Golden State languished in the lottery the year prior, It seems as though Durant and the Warriors are incapable of succeeding at the same time.

     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Jacque Vaughn wasn’t aware his Brooklyn Nets had the best first half in their history.
The Nets put up 91 points in the 1st half of their game against the Warriors tonight.
That is the 3rd-highest 1st half point total in NBA history.
“It’s the Warriors,” Durant said.
The Warriors scored the next seven in one of their only highlights of the night before Brooklyn extended it to 91-51 at the half on Durant’s 3-pointer.

     Warriors' historically terrible first half stamps ugly loss to Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors trailed 46-17 after the first quarter as they watched the home team torch the nets left and right with ease.
Golden State's invisible defense followed them in the second quarter, too.
"Well 13 turnovers in the first half," Steve said regarding the Warriors' biggest issue in their blowout loss.
The Nets' 18 points match the fewest a team has scored against the Warriors in the third quarter this season.
Defense still seems optional right now, and it erased any positives the Warriors can look at from a more uplifting second half in Brooklyn.
