     Nets’ Irving out against Warriors with right calf tightness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Kyrie Irving missed the Brooklyn Nets’ game against Golden State on Wednesday because of right calf tightness.
Coach Jacque Vaughn said after Irving arrived at the arena, he did some shooting and then reported his tightness.
The Nets initially listed their point guard as questionable but then scratched him shortly after.
Irving averaged 27.4 points in his last 10 games, including 38 in a victory over Detroit on Sunday.
He has missed just one game since returning from an eight-game suspension Nov. 20, sitting out the second night of a back-to-back Dec. 10.

     Kyrie Irving misses Nets-Warriors showdown due to right calf tightness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Nets announced just before tip-off that Kyrie Irving would not suit up due to right calf tightness.
“It just came after, he did some shooting a little bit earlier when he arrived,” Vaughn explained.
“And then came to me and said he experienced a little bit of tightness.
This was only the second time this year that Irving has missed a game due to an injury.
Irving had missed the Nets’ win over the Indiana Pacers on Dec. 10 due to left adductor tightness.

     Brooklyn Nets vs Golden State Warriors Injury Report Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In what may sound like one of the most unexpected statements of the season, the Brooklyn Nets are fully healthy while the Golden State Warriors are the exact opposite.
The Brooklyn Nets will only be missing G League players: David Duke Jr is out on a G League two-way, Kessler Edwards is out on a G League assignment, Day'Ron Sharpe is out on a G League assignment, an Alondes Williams is out on a G League two-way.
The Golden State Warriors have a far more daunting injury report, and one of the worst ones fans may have seen this season.
Either the Warriors get blown out and it's an easy Nets win, or it'll be the Nets' worst loss of the season and the Warriors' best win of the season.
With the way the Brooklyn Nets are playing though, it seems like it won't be the latter.
