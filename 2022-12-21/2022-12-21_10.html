     Summary: Jack Ryan turns Senator Chapin into the FBI for being secretly linked to a shell company helping mine "blue gold," an extremely valuable chemical element.
As anti-American protests threaten the US Embassy, Jack, Jim, and Mike head to a safe house.
Broadcasting of the footage coincides with the revelation that the results of the presidential election were rigged in President Reyes' favor.
Once Jack rescues Jim, he returns to the US where he confronts his boss Senator Chapin, who owns one of the shell companies behind the tantalum mining operations.
As the FBI serves Senator Chapin a warrant, Jack walks away, his head lowered somberly.

     ‘Jack Ryan’ Season 3 Episode 1 Recap: “Falcon”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At his age, and with a serious heart condition, it was time for someone he personally vetted and totally trusted like Jack to officially take Greer’s place as a CIA field agent.
And so we’re brought to Jack Ryan Season 3, where the newly-minted Rome Station case officer is passed a piece of tantalizing evidence by Russian government operative Zoya Ivanovna (Ana Ularu).
Putin, Zelenskyy, Biden: none of these politicians exist inside the “Ryanverse.” But the plot of Jack Ryan Season 3 is seeded with contemporary geopolitical zest.
Then Luka (James Cosmo), the crusty old Russian intelligence chief, rises from his chair.
“If you run, this is going to get much worse for you.” To which Jack Ryan smashes his agency-issued phone into fifty pieces and promptly melts into the hubbub of downtown Athens at night.

     Amazon Is Cornering the Dad TV Market
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the meantime, you can still get something close to a Dad Cinema fix through its worthy small-screen counterpart: Dad TV.
But within the broader umbrella of Dad Television, Amazon Prime Video has cornered the market on a beloved subgenre: the political action-thriller.
To be clear, the Amazon Jacks will never be mistaken for a John le Carré thriller in terms of complexity and moral ambiguity.
(Unsurprisingly, the authors behind Jack Ryan and Jack Reacher—the late Tom Clancy and Lee Child, respectively—are regarded as airport novel royalty.)
It’s these very qualities that make the Amazon Jacks an acquired taste, especially when you consider that the minds behind the source material tend to lean conservative.
