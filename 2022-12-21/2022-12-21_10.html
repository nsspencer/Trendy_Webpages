     Summary: In 2020, the New York Times obtained leaked copies of 18 years of Mr Trump's tax returns.
In a series of articles on the topic, the newspaper reported that the president paid no federal taxes in 10 of those 18 years and only $750 (£615) in each of his first two years in the White House.
It also disclosed that the then-president was in a fight with the Internal Revenue Service over the legitimacy of a $72.9m tax refund he had claimed and owed more than $400m in debt due by 2024.

     IRS was 'asleep at the wheel' for failing to audit Trump tax returns, Senate Finance chair says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The IRS "was asleep at the wheel" when it came to handling former President Donald Trump's tax returns, Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said Wednesday.
"The presidential audit program is broken," Wyden said in a statement vowing to work to pass legislation to reform that decades-old program.
The Ways and Means Committee's report on the presidential audit program was released after the panel's Democratic majority voted to release redacted copies of Trump's federal income tax returns.
"If this injustice can happen to President Trump, it can happen to all Americans without cause," Cheung's statement said.
Wyden in his statement Wednesday morning argued Trump's tax returns "exemplify the shortcomings of our tax code and consequences of Republicans' decades-long fight to gut the IRS."

     Trump’s Tax Returns Reflect a Broader American Problem

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Trump tax information for the years 2015-20 that the House Ways and Means Committee released on Tuesday confirms this picture.
The committee’s report was the culmination of a multiyear legal battle to get access to Trump’s returns.
The House Ways and Means Committee’s report and an accompanying one from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which helped analyze Trump’s tax returns, confirm that the I.R.S.

“Audits of closely-held entities often find personal expenditures being improperly deducted as business expenses,” the Committee’s report noted.

     Mandatory IRS audit of Trump taxes delayed during presidency, House panel says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The IRS only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings on April 3, 2019, more than two years into Trump’s presidency and just months after Democrats took control of the House.
That date coincides with Rep. Richard Neal, the panel chairman, asking the IRS for information related to Trump’s tax returns.
“I would love to give them, but I’m not going to do it while I’m under audit,” Trump said on April 10, 2019, before boarding the presidential helicopter.
The New York Times found that before he entered the White House, Trump was facing an IRS audit potentially tied to a $72.9 million tax refund arising from $700 million in losses he claimed in 2009.
Trump has argued there is little to learn from his tax returns even as he has fought to keep them private.
