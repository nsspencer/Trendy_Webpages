     Aaron Judge named 16th captain in New York Yankee history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The question of whether or not Aaron Judge would be named the next captain of the New York Yankees has been answered.
Judge recalled talking to Yankee owner Hal Steinbrenner on the phone during free agency about Munson and how the Yankee catcher impacted a young Steinbrenner growing up.
"We working some things out and, at the end of that conversation, he presented being the captain to me," Judge told a group of reporters.
Aaron Judge is the Yankees captain, and is first Yankee to hold the title since Derek Jeter retired.
Jeter and Judge are most recent but the list of Yankee captains goes back more than 100 years.

“That’s a pretty good list right there, not only great baseball players, but great ambassadors of the game and of the New York Yankees.
