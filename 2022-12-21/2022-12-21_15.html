     Rex Orange County: all sexual assault charges dropped
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All charges of sexual assault against singer-songwriter Rex Orange County, born Alexander O’Connor, have been dropped.
He appeared at Southwark crown court in early October and pleaded not guilty to all charges.
The case had been set to go to trial on 3 January 2023.
His early recordings caught the attention of American rapper Tyler, the Creator, who flew him to Los Angeles to work on his breakout fourth album Flower Boy.
O’Connor was the runner-up in BBC’s Sound of 2018 poll, and has collaborated with Randy Newman, Chance the Rapper and Daniel Caesar.

     Rex Orange County's sexual assault charges dismissed by London court
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just shortly before Rex Orange County was set to stand trial for six counts of sexual assault, a London court has dismissed the charges, BBC News reports.
In a Thursday statement, Crown Protection Services shared that the evidence in the case “no longer met” the standard for prosecution.
O’Connor has continuously maintained his innocence ever since CPS first filed charges, and appeared at London’s Southwark Crown Court on October 11 to formally deny all the allegations.

“We will always seek to prosecute sexual offences, where our legal test is met, no matter how challenging,” the office stated.

     Rex Orange County is ‘grateful’ after sexual-assault case dropped days before trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prosecutors in the United Kingdom have dropped their sexual-assault case against musician Rex Orange County days before it was set to go to trial.
The Crown Prosecution Service on Thursday said the evidence in the singer’s case “no longer met” its legal test for a prosecution, according to the BBC.
“We will always seek to prosecute sexual offences, where our legal test is met, no matter how challenging,” a spokesperson for prosecutors added.
The 24-year-old “Best Friend” artist, born Alex O'Connor, had been charged with six counts of sexual assault after a woman accused him of attacking her multiple times in London in June.
The woman also accused O'Connor of assaulting her in a taxi and three times at his home in Notting Hill the next day.
