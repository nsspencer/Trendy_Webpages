     Colts bench QB Matt Ryan, to start Nick Foles vs. Chargers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS -- Just days after yielding the biggest comeback victory in NFL history, the Indianapolis Colts are making yet another quarterback change ahead of Monday night's game against the Los Angeles Chargers.
Veteran Nick Foles will take the reins from Matt Ryan, whose continued struggles played a significant role in the Colts' epic collapse against the Minnesota Vikings on Saturday.
And ultimately you've gotta make plays in the NFL and we're not making nearly enough explosive plays."
The Colts deployed Ryan for the first seven weeks before benching him for 2021 sixth-round pick Sam Ehlinger.
The quarterback change is just the latest twist for a team that has endured constant change this season.

     Colts bench Matt Ryan, name Nick Foles starting QB for Monday's game vs. Chargers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A disappointing, tumultuous, borderline-chaotic season has produced another change under center for the Colts.
Nick Foles will start for Indianapolis in Monday night's meeting with the Los Angeles Chargers, interim head coach Jeff Saturday announced Wednesday.
Foles becomes the second quarterback to replace Matt Ryan in the starting lineup this season, and it sounds as if the Super Bowl LII MVP is in line to finish the season as QB1 for the Colts.
I feel bad for Matt but ultimately I feel like Nick gives us the best chance to win, and that's the direction we're headed."
Foles has taken just two snaps this season, entering in the final stages of an otherwise-decided game against Jacksonville in Week 2.

     Practice Notebook: Why Colts Turned To Nick Foles As Starting Quarterback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saturday on Wednesday explained his thought process prior to the Colts' first practice ahead of their Week 16 game against the Chargers.
The Colts are 4-9-1; they're 4-7-1 with Ryan as their starting quarterback and 1-4 since Saturday took over as interim head coach.
And Colts quarterbacks have the lowest average depth of target – 6.7 yards beyond the line of scrimmage – in the NFL entering Week 16.
For now, Foles will start in Week 16, and Saturday said Wednesday he hadn't decided on who would be the backup.
As for anything beyond Week 16 – well, we'll see where it goes.

The plan is for Foles to start the rest of the season, according to ESPN's Dan Graziano.
