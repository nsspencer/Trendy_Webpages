     5 French-Girl Makeup Tricks to Steal from 'Emily in Paris' Season 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “She’s settled in France now, but she’s still an American, and we don’t have to forget that,” makeup artist Aurélie Payen says of Emily Cooper, the titular character of Emily in Paris, played by Lily Collins.
Ahead of the new season, out on Netflix today, the pro is discussing her onscreen French-girl makeup tricks for storytelling, like how a Parisian red lip exudes Emily’s new sense of confidence.
“Emily knows what she wants, and she has to make choices in her profession and her personal life, so she’s wearing bold lips,” says Payen.

     Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu isn’t the villain of ‘Emily in Paris.’ She’s the role model
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “You come to Paris, you walk into my office and you don’t even bother to learn the language,” Sylvie, played by Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, says to Emily.
Playing Sylvie really made me realize that I had some aspects of my personality I didn’t know I had, and it gave me much more confidence.
It’s the sort of character Leroy-Beaulieu now says she isn’t interested in playing anymore.
Though she was born in Paris, Leroy-Beaulieu was mostly raised in Rome, until she moved back to Paris as a teenager (with her mother and brother) after her parents’ divorce.
“I realized really, really young how the other kids were acting weird with me,” she says.

Emily and Alfie are officially back together, and the reunited couple opens the episode by lounging around in bed.
But, this being Sylvie, she has a quick fix: force Emily and Madeline out, and regain control of the old Savoir space.
Elsewhere in Paris, Sylvie is plotting away at a dinner with Luc and Henri, her former building manager.
The next day at work, Emily shows up at her new office, Madeline’s hotel room.

     Emily in Paris Season-Premiere Recap: Cutting It Close
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is best to think of the entire exercise of Emily in Paris as a sort of collective hallucination that we are all having together.
When Emily wakes up, her curls are as stiff as if she shellacked them with hairspray in her sleep.
And for some reason Camille is obsessed with keeping her family’s business with Emily, no matter which company Emily works for.
Emily insists to Mindy that she is focusing on Alfie and has sooo much to figure out.
We are meant to believe that Emily was practical before she came to Paris, but based on everything we’ve ever seen her do this makes absolutely no sense.
