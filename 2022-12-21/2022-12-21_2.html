     TV Review: Emily In Paris season 3 is a mindless extravaganza
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To date, Emily In Paris‚Äô approach to the Parisian adventures of Chicago native Emily Cooper (Lily Collins) has been ‚Äúrinse and repeat,‚Äù and the show‚Äôs 10-episode third season stays true to these roots.
In many ways, Emily might feel like a spiritual successor to Star‚Äôs other heroine, Sex And The City‚Äôs Carrie Bradshaw.
Emily in Paris Season 3 | Official Trailer | NetflixThankfully, everyone around Emily has slightly more to offer.
Emily, Mindy, Sylvie, and Camille are all involved in the trope of juggling multiple love interests.
Emily In Paris is obviously a form of escapism; for that, it gets the credit, even if it doesn‚Äôt deserve much else.

This doesn‚Äôt go over well, and Sylvie tells her, ‚ÄúMe and an American company, it‚Äôs like you in that dress.

But is it at all plausible that Sylvie ‚Äî Sylvie!
As she leaves the meeting with Madeline, Emily realizes, all of a sudden, that Alfie is not her boyfriend anymore.
We are treated to some exceptionally clumsy plot-exposition-through-dialogue when Emily meets Nicolas de Leon, the very attractive heir to JVMA (the LVMH of Emily in Paris).
Unlike Emily, Sylvie is capable of processing new information and learning from her mistakes, so this time she takes her job offer back to her deputies to deliberate.

     Emily in Paris Season-Premiere Recap: Cutting It Close
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is best to think of the entire exercise of Emily in Paris as a sort of collective hallucination that we are all having together.
When Emily wakes up, her curls are as stiff as if she shellacked them with hairspray in her sleep.
And for some reason Camille is obsessed with keeping her family‚Äôs business with Emily, no matter which company Emily works for.
Emily insists to Mindy that she is focusing on Alfie and has sooo much to figure out.
We are meant to believe that Emily was practical before she came to Paris, but based on everything we‚Äôve ever seen her do this makes absolutely no sense.
