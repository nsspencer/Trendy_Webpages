     Voilà! 'Emily In Paris' returns, with surprises in store
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PARIS — (AP) — "Emily in Paris" fans will get a few surprises in their Christmas stockings, when the third season of the hit show arrives on Netflix this Wednesday.
Even the cast were shocked by the number of cliffhangers in the new series when they first read the scripts.
“Before it was only Emily’s chaos,” says Bravo.
And it’s a big soup of chaos and drama.”Season one arrived in October 2020, followed by a second last December.
Three years into playing their characters, the cast members are keen to point out where their roles start and finish.

     TV Review: Emily In Paris season 3 is a mindless extravaganza
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To date, Emily In Paris’ approach to the Parisian adventures of Chicago native Emily Cooper (Lily Collins) has been “rinse and repeat,” and the show’s 10-episode third season stays true to these roots.
In many ways, Emily might feel like a spiritual successor to Star’s other heroine, Sex And The City’s Carrie Bradshaw.
Emily in Paris Season 3 | Official Trailer | NetflixThankfully, everyone around Emily has slightly more to offer.
Emily, Mindy, Sylvie, and Camille are all involved in the trope of juggling multiple love interests.
Emily In Paris is obviously a form of escapism; for that, it gets the credit, even if it doesn’t deserve much else.

     ‘Emily in Paris’ Season 3 Episode 1 Recap: Less Is More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At the end of Emily in Paris Season 2, our charming protagonist found herself at a bit of a crossroads.
While Emily was left with Madeline in the empty offices, Sylvie soon revealed she wanted Emily to join her new team.
Please, Darren Star, I am begging you: bring in a convincing love interest for Emily this season.
Elsewhere in Paris, Alfie’s going-away party is kicking off, with Mindy, Camille and Gabriel joining him at the restaurant for goodbye drinks.
Left with Sylvie, Emily tries to explain herself, but she’s cut off when Sylvie, with a flick of her cig, fires her yet again.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Mindy has spent too much time with Emily and is picking up on her habits (keeping secrets, creating problems).
But is it at all plausible that Sylvie — Sylvie!
As she leaves the meeting with Madeline, Emily realizes, all of a sudden, that Alfie is not her boyfriend anymore.
We are treated to some exceptionally clumsy plot-exposition-through-dialogue when Emily meets Nicolas de Leon, the very attractive heir to JVMA (the LVMH of Emily in Paris).
Unlike Emily, Sylvie is capable of processing new information and learning from her mistakes, so this time she takes her job offer back to her deputies to deliberate.

     Emily in Paris Season-Premiere Recap: Cutting It Close
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is best to think of the entire exercise of Emily in Paris as a sort of collective hallucination that we are all having together.
When Emily wakes up, her curls are as stiff as if she shellacked them with hairspray in her sleep.
And for some reason Camille is obsessed with keeping her family’s business with Emily, no matter which company Emily works for.
Emily insists to Mindy that she is focusing on Alfie and has sooo much to figure out.
We are meant to believe that Emily was practical before she came to Paris, but based on everything we’ve ever seen her do this makes absolutely no sense.
