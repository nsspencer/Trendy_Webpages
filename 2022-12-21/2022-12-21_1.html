     Summary: But why isn't the day that we get the least amount of warming sunshine the coldest point of the winter rather than the start of it?

     A guide to the winter solstice, shortest day and longest night of the year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the winter solstice, the sun appears directly over the Tropic of Capricorn, a line of latitude 23.5 degrees south of Earth’s equator.
The low sun angle means you will cast your longest midday shadow of the year on the winter solstice (assuming skies are clear).
Meanwhile, in the Southern Hemisphere, Dec. 21 marks the first day of summer and the longest day of the year.
Though the winter solstice has the shortest period of daylight, it’s actually not the day of the latest sunrise or earliest sunset.
Closer to the Arctic Circle, the earliest sunset and latest sunrise happen on or near the winter solstice.
