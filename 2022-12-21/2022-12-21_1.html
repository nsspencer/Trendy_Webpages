     Winter solstice 2022: Today is the shortest day of the year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today, however, is the winter solstice, or what’s often called the shortest day of the year.
According to NASA the winter solstice marks the day when the sun at solar noon is the lowest in the sky, and the time from sunrise to sunset is the shortest of the year.
The December or winter solstice usually happens on Dec. 21 or 22.
Today’s winter solstice marks the shortest day and the longest night for the Northern Hemisphere, while the opposite is happening south of the equator.
NOAA released its winter outlook a few months back and suggested a warmer-than-average winter was possible in Alabama.

     A guide to the winter solstice, shortest day and longest night of the year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the winter solstice, the sun appears directly over the Tropic of Capricorn, a line of latitude 23.5 degrees south of Earth’s equator.
The low sun angle means you will cast your longest midday shadow of the year on the winter solstice (assuming skies are clear).
Meanwhile, in the Southern Hemisphere, Dec. 21 marks the first day of summer and the longest day of the year.
Though the winter solstice has the shortest period of daylight, it’s actually not the day of the latest sunrise or earliest sunset.
Closer to the Arctic Circle, the earliest sunset and latest sunrise happen on or near the winter solstice.
