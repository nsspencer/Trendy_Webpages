     U.S. safety agency probes two more Tesla crashes involving suspected driver assistance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [1/2] A Tesla logo on a Model S is photographed inside of a Tesla dealership in New York, U.S., April 29, 2016.
REUTERS/Lucas JacksonWASHINGTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Thursday it has opened two new special investigations into crashes involving Tesla (TSLA.O) vehicles where advanced driver assistance systems are suspected to have been in use.
Since 2016, NHTSA has opened 41 special crash investigations involving Tesla vehicles and where advanced driver assistance systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used, including eight investigations in 2022.
But Tesla's advanced driver assistance systems - and Musk's claims about them - face growing legal, regulatory and public scrutiny.
In June, NHTSA upgraded its defect probe into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with Autopilot and involving crashes with parked emergency vehicles, a required step before it could seek a possible recall.

     Tesla offers rare year-end discounts on 2 top-selling models
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DETROIT — (AP) — Tesla Inc. is offering rare discounts through year's end on its two top-selling models, an indication that demand is slowing for its electric vehicles.
The move comes ahead of a new federal tax credit of up to $7,500 that's scheduled to take effect Jan. 1.
Teslas weren't eligible for a previous federal tax credit program because the company had reached a limit of 200,000 vehicles sold.
On the company's third-quarter earnings conference call in October, Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said Tesla will fall just short of its 50% sales growth target.
To reach the 50% sales growth target, Tesla must have a stellar performance in the fourth quarter.

     Summary: Tesla offers a standard driver assistance package called Autopilot in all its new cars today.
Another recent crash added to NHTSA's list involved a 2020 Tesla Model 3, the company's entry-level sedan.
According to data obtained from NHTSA by CNBC, the agency is looking into at least 41 crashes involving Tesla vehicles where automated features such as automatic emergency braking, or more extensive driver assistance system features included in Autopilot, FSD and FSD Beta were involved.
The California DMV has accused Tesla of engaging in false advertising around its driver assistance systems.
Amid tough economic conditions, Tesla has recently offered steep discounts on its cars in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and China.

     Musk says he's "definitely" not selling more Tesla stock in 2023
    </h2>

     Summary: Elon Musk said Thursday afternoon in a Twitter Spaces that he’s not selling any Tesla stock next year "under any circumstances."
Definitely not next year under any circumstances and you know, probably not the year thereafter."
Why it matters: Musk needs to assure Tesla investors that he's not harming one of his companies to support another.
Specifically, he's been trying to reinforce his commitment to Tesla as he's sold $23 billion worth of Tesla stock in 2022 to "save" Twitter's business.
He said that compared to Tesla, Twitter is “about 10% of the complexity,” which those in the Twitter Spaces seemed relieved to hear.

     Summary: Dec 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares are on track for their worst month ever as a sell-off deepened on Thursday over worries about softening demand for electric cars and Chief Executive Elon Musk's distraction with Twitter.
Tesla's stock has tumbled 36% so far in December, putting it on track for its worst ever monthly performance.
By comparison, Tesla's shares dropped 22% in March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic tipped financial markets into a tailspin.
Musk has also sold almost $40 billion worth of his Tesla shares this year, adding to pressure on the stock as investors worry he could sell more to keep Twitter afloat.
