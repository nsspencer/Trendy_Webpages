     ‘Jack Ryan’ Season 3 Episode 1 Recap: “Falcon”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At his age, and with a serious heart condition, it was time for someone he personally vetted and totally trusted like Jack to officially take Greer’s place as a CIA field agent.
And so we’re brought to Jack Ryan Season 3, where the newly-minted Rome Station case officer is passed a piece of tantalizing evidence by Russian government operative Zoya Ivanovna (Ana Ularu).
Putin, Zelenskyy, Biden: none of these politicians exist inside the “Ryanverse.” But the plot of Jack Ryan Season 3 is seeded with contemporary geopolitical zest.
Then Luka (James Cosmo), the crusty old Russian intelligence chief, rises from his chair.
“If you run, this is going to get much worse for you.” To which Jack Ryan smashes his agency-issued phone into fifty pieces and promptly melts into the hubbub of downtown Athens at night.
