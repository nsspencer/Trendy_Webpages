    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2020, the New York Times obtained leaked copies of 18 years of Mr Trump's tax returns.
In a series of articles on the topic, the newspaper reported that the president paid no federal taxes in 10 of those 18 years and only $750 (£615) in each of his first two years in the White House.
It also disclosed that the then-president was in a fight with the Internal Revenue Service over the legitimacy of a $72.9m tax refund he had claimed and owed more than $400m in debt due by 2024.

     IRS was 'asleep at the wheel' for failing to audit Trump tax returns, Senate Finance chair says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The IRS "was asleep at the wheel" when it came to handling former President Donald Trump's tax returns, Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said Wednesday.
"The presidential audit program is broken," Wyden said in a statement vowing to work to pass legislation to reform that decades-old program.
The Ways and Means Committee's report on the presidential audit program was released after the panel's Democratic majority voted to release redacted copies of Trump's federal income tax returns.
"If this injustice can happen to President Trump, it can happen to all Americans without cause," Cheung's statement said.
Wyden in his statement Wednesday morning argued Trump's tax returns "exemplify the shortcomings of our tax code and consequences of Republicans' decades-long fight to gut the IRS."

     Trump’s tax returns are about to become public. What happens now?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House Ways and Means Committee voted along party lines Tuesday to release Trump’s tax returns for 2015 through 2020.
The IRS has had an agency policy of auditing individual tax returns for presidents and vice presidents every year dating back to the Nixon era.
The agency did so on the same day the committee asked for copies of Trump’s tax returns and related audits, and it didn’t begin its audits of tax returns filed during his presidency until after he had left office.
What Trump’s tax returns show us so farThe reports released Tuesday provide new information about Trump’s finances throughout his presidency.
The New York Times previously obtained two decades of Trump’s tax returns, ending in 2017, which showed a long history of claiming large losses to offset his federal income tax liability.

     How Donald Trump Politicized Releasing Tax Returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When he was a candidate in 2016, Trump told reporters he would release his returns, but never did it.
Presidential candidates from both parties releasing their tax returns began in the 1970s, when Richard Nixon decided to release his tax returns in the wake of press reports about his tax filings.
The IRS manual requires that the President and Vice President’s tax returns are audited each year.
Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, has also written legislation that would require presidential candidates to make their tax returns public.
Wyden has indicated that his committee could take up the investigation into the decision by Trump’s Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to not comply with a request from Congress for Trump’s tax returns.

     Five things we’ve learned through the release of Trump’s tax records
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “There were no audits in a timely manner,” Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.)
“Not surprising,” Steve Rosenthal, an analyst with the Tax Policy Center who has testified to Congress about Trump’s tax returns, said in an interview about those audits remaining incomplete.
On the same day, the IRS initiated its first audit of Donald Trump’s tax returns,” Beyer wrote.
“Donald Trump’s tax returns exemplify the shortcomings of our tax code,” Wyden said Wednesday.
“I won’t speculate on what the next Congress and this committee will focus on related to tax returns,” he said.
