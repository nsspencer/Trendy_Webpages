     Jeter on Judge being captain: 'This is historic'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “His size was the first thing that stands out, because you don’t see too many baseball players that size,” Jeter said.
“Everyone at the camp was kind of quiet; they don’t say too much.
But you could tell he was respectful.
You can tell if people are paying attention.
You could tell that he was listening, and I take all responsibility now for him being captain.”

     Yankees captain Aaron Judge and the drive that demonstrates his leadership
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That willingness to do that behind-the-scenes work — and the results that it brought — led to Judge becoming the Yankees’ 16th captain in franchise history.
Judge’s swing path mirrors that of Giants legend Barry Bonds.
Until this season, Schenck was essentially on-call, coming to work with Judge only when he was summoned by the slugger.
That’s how it worked in 2017 when after winning the Home Run Derby during his rookie season, Judge felt that his swing was out of sorts.
