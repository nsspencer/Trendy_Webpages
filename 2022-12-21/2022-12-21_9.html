     Warriors GM Bob Myers shares funny Aaron Judge exchange in New York hotel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I saw Judge yesterday in our hotel in New York and I said 'Can I at least get an explanation?'
and he started laughing,” Myers said on 95.7 The Game’s “Steiny &amp; Guru” Wednesday morning.
And like Myers, Giants fans never got answers.
Just like the Giants, Myers can’t seem to catch a break.
The last time the GM joined the “Steiny &amp; Guru” show, the Judge news had just been announced.

Jeter was on hand for Wednesday’s press conference at Yankee Stadium, as was Willie Randolph, who served as a Bombers co-captain from 1986-88.
“I looked back at the list -- Thurman Munson, Lou Gehrig, Ron Guidry, Willie Randolph, Derek Jeter, Don Mattingly,” Judge said.
“That’s a pretty good list right there, not only great baseball players, but great ambassadors of the game and of the New York Yankees.
It was the early morning in California as Judge listened, Steinbrenner’s words bouncing through space from a highway rest area somewhere in Italy.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I was a little upset that the numbers came out,” Judge told TIME.
The GM said earlier this month that he had told Odle beforehand that he would disclose the figures.
During the season, Cashman acknowledged, Judge had gone from a player the Yankees wanted to re-sign to one they could not lose.
Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner was vacationing in Italy, and at 3 a.m. Pacific, he called Judge and asked what it would take.
Steinbrenner called Judge during the winter meetings and agreed to give the slugger a ninth year on his contract.
