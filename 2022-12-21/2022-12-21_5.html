It‚Äôs the sort of character Leroy-Beaulieu now says she isn‚Äôt interested in playing anymore.
Though she was born in Paris, Leroy-Beaulieu was mostly raised in Rome, until she moved back to Paris as a teenager (with her mother and brother) after her parents‚Äô divorce.
‚ÄúI realized really, really young how the other kids were acting weird with me,‚Äù she says.
