     Brooklyn Nets vs Golden State Warriors Injury Report Revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In what may sound like one of the most unexpected statements of the season, the Brooklyn Nets are fully healthy while the Golden State Warriors are the exact opposite.
The Brooklyn Nets will only be missing G League players: David Duke Jr is out on a G League two-way, Kessler Edwards is out on a G League assignment, Day'Ron Sharpe is out on a G League assignment, an Alondes Williams is out on a G League two-way.
The Golden State Warriors have a far more daunting injury report, and one of the worst ones fans may have seen this season.
Either the Warriors get blown out and it's an easy Nets win, or it'll be the Nets' worst loss of the season and the Warriors' best win of the season.
With the way the Brooklyn Nets are playing though, it seems like it won't be the latter.
