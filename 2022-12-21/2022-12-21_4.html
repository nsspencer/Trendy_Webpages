     Summary: “She’s settled in France now, but she’s still an American, and we don’t have to forget that,” makeup artist Aurélie Payen says of Emily Cooper, the titular character of Emily in Paris, played by Lily Collins.
Ahead of the new season, out on Netflix today, the pro is discussing her onscreen French-girl makeup tricks for storytelling, like how a Parisian red lip exudes Emily’s new sense of confidence.
“Emily knows what she wants, and she has to make choices in her profession and her personal life, so she’s wearing bold lips,” says Payen.

The third season of Netflix's Emily in Paris didn't end well for the English heartthrob, played by Lucien Laviscount—as he dumped girlfriend Emily Cooper (Lily Collins) after her true feelings for Gabriel (Lucas Bravo) were revealed.
But that doesn't necessarily mean we've seen the last of Alfie, at least according to Lucien himself.
"But honestly I think I've had a really, really incredible two seasons on this show.

     Summary: “You come to Paris, you walk into my office and you don’t even bother to learn the language,” Sylvie, played by Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, says to Emily.
Playing Sylvie really made me realize that I had some aspects of my personality I didn’t know I had, and it gave me much more confidence.
It’s the sort of character Leroy-Beaulieu now says she isn’t interested in playing anymore.
Though she was born in Paris, Leroy-Beaulieu was mostly raised in Rome, until she moved back to Paris as a teenager (with her mother and brother) after her parents’ divorce.
“I realized really, really young how the other kids were acting weird with me,” she says.

     Summary: The chicest character in the series, played by Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, spends season three building up her own boutique marketing firm after a grand exit from Savoir at the conclusion of season two.
Sylvie may be an entrepreneurial force to be reckoned with, but this season we also see a vulnerable side that serves to enhance her strength.
Sylvie isn’t totally single this season, and she does find herself in a bit of a love triangle, but there’s not really a central romantic relationship she’s focused on.
Photo: STÉPHANIE BRANCHU/NETFLIXEmily is a social-media influencer on the show, and Sylvie isn’t really into Instagram.
I think last season, I was more into orange blossom.

     Summary: Emily In Paris Season 3 started with bangs for our heroine, played by Lily Collins, and ended with a bang, setting major cliffhangers for most characters in the show.
He revealed the main theme for Season 4 and whether Emily In Paris will be going to Eurovision next season.
Camille Razat as Camille in episode 304 of Emily in Paris/Netflix Marie Etchegoyen/NetflixSTAR: I think there’s a number of aspects.
I think Season 4 is about how to balance business and toxic relationships, because that’s going to be happening with a lot of our characters.
I think Emily brings in this sense of needing to have the loudest voice in the room to be heard.
