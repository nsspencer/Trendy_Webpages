Driving the news: Zelensky and President Biden will have an "in-depth, strategic discussion" at the White House about the war, additional U.S. military aid and tightening sanctions on Russia, a senior U.S. official told reporters.
The two will then hold a press conference before Zelensky visits Capitol Hill for meetings and to address a joint session of Congress.

     Biden tells a thankful Zelensky that Ukrainians ‘inspire the world’ as leaders begin historic meeting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “We are working in lockstep with him and his staff to make sure we can make this trip safely, both coming to the United States and coming back.
Zelensky traveled to Poland by train as part of his journey to the United States on Wednesday.
According to the source, the military risk had to be calculated allowing the Ukrainian president to make the short overseas trip without jeopardizing the military situation.
The training for Patriot missile batteries normally takes multiple months, a process the United States will now carry out under the pressure of near-daily aerial attacks from Russia.
The official was clear, however, that Biden remained steadfast in keeping the United States out of direct conflict with Russia, despite the enhanced security assistance.
