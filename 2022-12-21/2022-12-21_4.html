     Trump tax returns: House committee report shows IRS failed to conduct 'mandatory' audits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The IRS failed to audit former President Donald Trump's federal tax returns for his first two years in the White House, even though an IRS program states the returns are "subject to mandatory review," a newly released House committee report disclosed.
Trump filed tax returns in 2017 for the prior two tax years.
And the tax agency started its audit on the same day the House Ways and Means Committee sought Trump's tax returns and related audits, the report said.
An internal IRS memo cited "some animosity" between an IRS counsel and one of Trump's tax attorneys.

     IRS failed to conduct timely mandatory audits of Trump’s taxes while president
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new report suggests US tax authorities only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings in 2019, more than two years into his presidency.
The audit, a requirement dating back to the Nixon administration, came only after Democrats took control of the House and requested Trump’s tax information.
Trump’s tax records amount to thousands of pages and may take days to be made public as the committee works to redacted sensitive details.
The dispute over Trump’s tax returns speaks to a larger fight over the IRS.
Democrats argue it is ill-equipped to audit high-income, complex tax returns, and instead targets filers in lower-income brackets.

     Mandatory IRS audit of Trump taxes delayed during presidency, House panel says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The IRS only began to audit Trump’s 2016 tax filings on April 3, 2019, more than two years into Trump’s presidency and just months after Democrats took control of the House.
That date coincides with Rep. Richard Neal, the panel chairman, asking the IRS for information related to Trump’s tax returns.
“I would love to give them, but I’m not going to do it while I’m under audit,” Trump said on April 10, 2019, before boarding the presidential helicopter.
The New York Times found that before he entered the White House, Trump was facing an IRS audit potentially tied to a $72.9 million tax refund arising from $700 million in losses he claimed in 2009.
Trump has argued there is little to learn from his tax returns even as he has fought to keep them private.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “There were no audits in a timely manner,” Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.)
“Not surprising,” Steve Rosenthal, an analyst with the Tax Policy Center who has testified to Congress about Trump’s tax returns, said in an interview about those audits remaining incomplete.
On the same day, the IRS initiated its first audit of Donald Trump’s tax returns,” Beyer wrote.
“Donald Trump’s tax returns exemplify the shortcomings of our tax code,” Wyden said Wednesday.
“I won’t speculate on what the next Congress and this committee will focus on related to tax returns,” he said.

     House committee votes to make public Donald Trump's tax records and criticizes IRS for lack of mandatory audits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House Ways and Means Committee voted Tuesday to make six years of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns public — potentially ending years of speculation about what they might reveal about his business dealings and personal wealth.
The committee report listed several overarching issues it believed the IRS should have investigated but did not.
It is the power to embarrass, harass or destroy a private citizen through disclosure of their tax returns," Brady said.
Trump was the first president to refuse to make his tax returns public since the 1970s.
In both the year he won the presidency and his first year in office, he paid only $750 in federal income tax, the newspaper found.
