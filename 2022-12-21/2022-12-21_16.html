     Summary: The Devastating Death Of Ali Ahmed Aslam, Chicken Tikka Masala PioneerThe man credited with creating one of the most popular dishes rooted in Indian cuisine, chicken tikka masala, has died.
Ali Ahmed Aslam died at the age of 77 in his longtime hometown of Glasgow, Scotland, per The Guardian.
Pakistani by birth, Aslam moved to Glasgow with his family when he was just a child, per The Glasgow Times.
The family had little money and worked hard to make a living, with Ali Ahmed Aslam working both day and night jobs to help the family make ends meet.
In fact, legend has it that it was here that chicken tikka masala, a staple on any Indian restaurant menu, was born.

     The legacy of chicken tikka masala whose ‘inventor’ Ali Ahmed passed away at 77
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier this week on Monday, chicken tikka masala lovers and anyone remotely interested in the history of Indian food and the way it travels and influences cultures, woke up to a rude shock.
Ali Ahmed Aslam, the chef who claimed to have invented the chicken tikka masala, passed away at 77.
He was born in Pakistan and moved to Glasgow after a few years on his own, starting his restaurant soon after.
So, he simply added a portion of his tomato soup to the chicken gravy, topped with some cream, thus leading to the invention of the chicken tikka masala.
It is important to note that Ahmed's Shish Mahal restaurant began operations in London’s west end in 1964.

Who created chicken tikka masala?
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andy Buchanan/AFP via Getty Images Andy Buchanan/AFP via Getty ImagesAnother point of debate is the dish's relatively mild taste.
But to Trivedi-Grenier, the idea that chicken tikka masala was created solely to suit British people's palates is "garish" when one considers the symbolism.
Ironically, when it came to his own taste preferences, Aslam ranked chicken tikka masala fairly low, his nephew said.

Shish Mahal says Aslam came up with the chicken tikka masala recipe by accident in the early 1970s, after a customer complained that the chicken tikka was too dry.
When Lonely Planet featured chicken tikka masala as part of a recipe book on the world’s best spicy food, it noted Aslam’s story.
A similar recipe, which some food historians believe to be a prototype for the chicken tikka masala, is found in “Mrs.
