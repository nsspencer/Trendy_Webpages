     Emily in Paris Season 3 Has a Mad Men Easter Egg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Was there really a Mad Men Easter egg in Emily in Paris season three?
In episode two, titled "What's It All About...," Emily (Lily Collins) is left perplexed over her relationship status with Alfie (Lucien Laviscount).
However, fans of Mad Men are surely to recognize the song, as Jessica Par√©‚Äîwho played Megan Draper on four seasons of the AMC drama‚Äîfamously performed the love song in season five's two-episode premiere, titled "A Little Kiss."
News can confirm that it is, in fact, this rendition that made it's way into the new season of Emily in Paris.
For those who need a refresher on the notable Mad Men scene, Megan sexily serenades her husband Don Draper (Jon Hamm) with her version of "Zou Bisou Bisou" on his 40th birthday.

     Summary: To date, Emily In Paris‚Äô approach to the Parisian adventures of Chicago native Emily Cooper (Lily Collins) has been ‚Äúrinse and repeat,‚Äù and the show‚Äôs 10-episode third season stays true to these roots.
In many ways, Emily might feel like a spiritual successor to Star‚Äôs other heroine, Sex And The City‚Äôs Carrie Bradshaw.

Emily, Mindy, Sylvie, and Camille are all involved in the trope of juggling multiple love interests.
Emily In Paris is obviously a form of escapism; for that, it gets the credit, even if it doesn‚Äôt deserve much else.
