     ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ Was So Good China Scrapped Its Ripoff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How good was Top Gun: Maverick?
It was set to be the nation’s answer to the Top Gun sequel, which would be great because Top Gun: Maverick was never cleared for release in China.
Or, put another way: Top Gun: Maverick was too damn good.
It was made in cooperation with the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, just as Top Gun: Maverick was made with help from the U.S. Navy.
“It could come anytime,” they said, “or it might never come at all.”In the meantime, in the good ol’ U.S. of A., Top Gun: Maverick just hit Paramount+.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The bad guys in Top Gun: Maverick may have been explicitly vague other people from some other place with some other ideology in an attempt to make sure the movie would still play in countries that Hollywood has… historically offended.
That mostly worked out, with the movie making a ton of money internationally, but it never did get a release in China for a few reasons.
But there was a problem: Maverick was really goddamn good, and Born To Fly, apparently, was not.
It’s like if Top Gun: Maverick made a big deal about how great Tim Cruise is, and then it didn’t even make Tim Cruise look very cool.
So, rather than risk any sort of embarrassment, the movie was canned.

     'Top Gun: Maverick' Is Streaming Now on Paramount+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You can now feel the need for speed from the comfort of your own home, as Top Gun: Maverick, arguably the number one legacy sequel of 2022, is now available to stream globally on Paramount+ in time for the holidays.
The long-awaited follow-up to the 1986 classic Top Gun follows Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, played by Tom Cruise, over thirty years after the events of the first film.
Along with the new release to streaming, Paramount+ has also released a promo for the film's streaming debut that gives us a new look into the film that has inspired a whole new generation to sport mustaches and name their sons Maverick — or Goose, if they're really daring.
Featuring no shortage of exciting flight scenes and some emotional but stoic male-on-male bonding, Top Gun: Maverick is maybe the perfect movie to put on while trying to muster conversation with your emotionally distant father this Christmas.
Top Gun: Maverick is now available to stream on Paramount+, as well as being available on digital, DVD, and Blu-ray.

     What's Happening With Top Gun: Maverick Lawsuit As Tom Cruise Blockbuster Hits Streaming

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This year saw the return of Tom Cruise’s Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell as he and the cast of Top Gun: Maverick delivered a massive hit.
However, that success eventually saw a recent lawsuit filed against the studio, which has come into focus again as Maverick hits streaming.
With the production of Top Gun: Maverick being claimed as completed in May 2021, the Yonay family believes that said sequel infringed their rights to the source material.
As we’re currently at the end of 2022, we might not hear anything further about the Top Gun lawsuit until early in 2023.
At the moment, you’re now able to enjoy Top Gun: Maverick in the comfort of your own home.

Top Gun: Maverick (2022) | Paramount+ (pick of the week)Tom Cruise as Maverick in Top Gun: Maverick (Paramount)Even 36 years later the need for speed hasn’t dulled with Top Gun, as Joseph Kosinski – having directed another belated sequel to an 80s blockbuster in Tron Legacy – delivers the long-delayed Top Gun: Maverick.
To concern oneself with the dubious jingoistic politics of Top Gun: Maverick is to also deny oneself a pretty thrilling good time with one of 2022’s biggest films.
Watch a trailer for Glass Onion: A Knives Out MysteryBlanc isn’t the only uninvited guest however, and of course, someone dies, and it’s up to Blanc to figure out who planned it.
But its dialogue is still razor sharp and its social satire surprisingly well-timed, and a cozy, funny mystery film in its own right.

     Mission Aborted: Why China’s ‘Top Gun’ Never Took Off
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The country’s most daring and promising young fighter pilot takes part in a top-secret testing program for the military’s most advanced fighter jets.
With hot young Chinese test pilots and heart-stopping aerial acrobatics, Born to Fly was supposed to be China’s answer to Top Gun: Maverick.
The wildly anticipated action flick stars Wang Yibo, a pop star turned actor (think China’s Harry Styles), and was written and directed by Liu Xiaoshi, who cut his teeth making popular promotional videos for the Chinese military.
Produced in full cooperation with the People’s Liberation Army Air Force — much as Maverick was with the U.S. Navy — the film showcases China’s most advanced stealth fighter jet, the J-20.
There was a time when Maverick himself was actually expected to cruise into China’s airspace.
