     TV Review: Emily In Paris season 3 is a mindless extravaganza
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To date, Emily In Paris‚Äô approach to the Parisian adventures of Chicago native Emily Cooper (Lily Collins) has been ‚Äúrinse and repeat,‚Äù and the show‚Äôs 10-episode third season stays true to these roots.
In many ways, Emily might feel like a spiritual successor to Star‚Äôs other heroine, Sex And The City‚Äôs Carrie Bradshaw.
Emily in Paris Season 3 | Official Trailer | NetflixThankfully, everyone around Emily has slightly more to offer.
Emily, Mindy, Sylvie, and Camille are all involved in the trope of juggling multiple love interests.
Emily In Paris is obviously a form of escapism; for that, it gets the credit, even if it doesn‚Äôt deserve much else.

     Stream It or Skip It: ‚ÄòEmily in Paris‚Äô Season 3 on Netflix, Where Lily Collins Is Back With a Bang (and Bangs)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EMILY IN PARIS SEASON 3: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?
Our Take: Part of Emily in Paris‚Äô charm is that the show never takes itself too seriously.
When I think of the perfect holiday break/end of year binge, Season 3 of Emily in Paris is the gold standard.
Is there a long list of more substantial television series that best Emily in Paris?
But much like an occasional trip to McDonald‚Äôs, Emily in Paris is a special mood-boosting treat that‚Äôs mean to be savored.
