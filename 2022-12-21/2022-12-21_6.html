     5 French-Girl Makeup Tricks to Steal from 'Emily in Paris' Season 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “She’s settled in France now, but she’s still an American, and we don’t have to forget that,” makeup artist Aurélie Payen says of Emily Cooper, the titular character of Emily in Paris, played by Lily Collins.
Ahead of the new season, out on Netflix today, the pro is discussing her onscreen French-girl makeup tricks for storytelling, like how a Parisian red lip exudes Emily’s new sense of confidence.
“Emily knows what she wants, and she has to make choices in her profession and her personal life, so she’s wearing bold lips,” says Payen.

     Summary: PARIS — (AP) — "Emily in Paris" fans will get a few surprises in their Christmas stockings, when the third season of the hit show arrives on Netflix this Wednesday.
Even the cast were shocked by the number of cliffhangers in the new series when they first read the scripts.
“Before it was only Emily’s chaos,” says Bravo.
And it’s a big soup of chaos and drama.”Season one arrived in October 2020, followed by a second last December.

Emily In Paris fans went on a rollercoaster in Season 3 as Emily (Lily Collins) finally made the decision to commit to a romantic life in Paris and settle down with Alfie (Lucien Laviscount).
It looked like Emily had finally figured out what she wanted until a sudden engagement between Gabriel (Lucas Bravo) and Camille (Camille Razat) sent everything spinning out of control.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Emily in Paris tries to answer this in Episode 4, which is filled with silly social media montages, enough Kir Royales to have us feeling tipsy just watching and some very PG ferris wheel sex.
We open with Emily soaking up that fun-employment life after quitting Savoir for more time in Paris, and she’s filling her days with Instagram Lives, unfortunately regressing to a level of cringe we haven’t seen since Season 1.
After the meeting wraps, Luc reveals that Emily actually shared it with him, and that’s how he and Julien came up with it.
The next day, Sylvie meets with Camille and her family, who are shocked that Emily is still in Paris and spending her days doing Segway tours.
Back home at her apartment after work, Sylvie is sitting on the couch getting a little too cozy with her husband, whom she’s no longer romantically involved with…unless?

Mindy joins their huddle, and Nicolas of JVMA fame approaches because … he and Mindy know each other!!
The JVMA party is a sunblock launch for which Nicolas secured Mindy and Emily some VIP lounge chairs.
Although Mindy begs Emily not to “do something weird,” Emily has already commandeered the aux and put the song over the speakers.
Nicolas is surprisingly chill about Emily having to take back the song — maybe he never really liked it?

     Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu isn’t the villain of ‘Emily in Paris.’ She’s the role model
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “You come to Paris, you walk into my office and you don’t even bother to learn the language,” Sylvie, played by Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, says to Emily.
Playing Sylvie really made me realize that I had some aspects of my personality I didn’t know I had, and it gave me much more confidence.
It’s the sort of character Leroy-Beaulieu now says she isn’t interested in playing anymore.
Though she was born in Paris, Leroy-Beaulieu was mostly raised in Rome, until she moved back to Paris as a teenager (with her mother and brother) after her parents’ divorce.
“I realized really, really young how the other kids were acting weird with me,” she says.
