     Steph Curry to play in NBA playoffs Game 1 for Warriors vs. Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s official: Steph Curry is back.
The star point guard was previously listed as probable for the Warriors’ matchup against the Denver Nuggets on Saturday, but Steve Kerr told reporters prior to the start of Game 1 of the Western Conference playoffs that Curry will in fact see the court.
âSteph will play, I can tell you that.â - Steve KerrWonât reveal who the starters are for Game 1 or what Steph Curryâs minutes restriction is — Dalton Johnson (@DaltonJ_Johnson) April 16, 2022Kerr said Friday that if Curry was cleared to play in Saturday’s game, he would be inserted into the starting lineup but on a minutes restriction.
Curry is returning to court competition for the first time in a month since suffering a sprained left foot and bone bruise.

     Golden State Warriors' Steph Curry will play in Game 1 of playoff series against Denver Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors’ playoff campaign will begin with star Steph Curry in the lineup.
This announcement came from head coach Steve Kerr, who spoke to reporters prior to the team’s Game 1 matchup against the Denver Nuggets for their opening round playoff series.
Curry had been dealing with a foot injury that kept him out for the final 12 games of the regular season.
It’s no secret that the Warriors are objectively worse off without Curry on the team.
His presence requires entire defensive game plans to revolve around where he is on the court at all times.
