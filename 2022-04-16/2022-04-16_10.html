     Harry Styles performs on stage with 'star-struck' Shania Twain at Coachella
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Harry Styles treated fans at his Coachella concert on Friday to an unexpected guest: Shania Twain.
Her appearance didn't come until the last few minutes of Styles' set.
The iconic refrain of Twain's "Man, I Feel Like a Woman" began to play as soon as Styles had finished performing a classic from his boy band days with One Direction, "What Makes You Beautiful."
Styles, dressed in a low-cut jumpsuit emblazoned with rainbow sequins, appeared to look confused until Twain, 56, appeared, rising on a platform from behind the stage dressed in a matching sequined dress and white go-go boots.
Styles, 28, jumped in for the chorus of "Man, I Feel Like a Woman" and the pair danced playfully on stage to resounding applause.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They say rock is dead, but it‚Äôs wearing a sequined catsuit, headlining the first night at Coachella and called Harry Styles.
But tonight, all the bombast and pomp of a Big Stadium Pop-Rock Show is in flamboyant full force.
But live, it‚Äôs clear that the stuff that makes Styles is his gift as a nimble performer.
Part of the fun of Coachella is who gets brought on stage for a guest warble, but Styles keeps it light on surprises.
Late Night Talking, his final new song, is further evidence of a funk-fuelled direction, sounding not unlike Jessie Ware.
