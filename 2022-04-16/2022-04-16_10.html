     When to see this weekend's Full Pink Moon of April 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APRIL'S full Moon is set to illuminate the sky this Easter with Saturday, Easter Sunday, and Bank Holiday Monday seeing the 'Pink Moon' mark the biggest and brightest full Moon of 2022.
Also known as 'Sprouting Green Moon', 'Fish Moon', or 'Hare Moon', the Moon will light up the spring sky between 7pm and 8pm.
This means that April's full Moon is the Paschal Full Moon, an important Moon to those who celebrate Easter, since Easter's date depends on the date of the Paschal Full Moon.
The name 'Pink Moon' is thought to derive from pink flowers, and in particular phlox, (Phlox subulata), which starts to bloom during spring and summer.
It is thought that during the 1930's an American farmer's almanac produced in the state of Maine, started to publish names for each full Moon in the year, with 'Pink Moon' given to April's full Moon.
