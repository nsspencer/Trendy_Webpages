     Summary: ‚ÄãIt‚Äôs official: Steph Curry is back.
Steph is playing in Game 1 √∞¬ü¬ë¬è pic.twitter.com/4vAtpQWlDK ‚Äî Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) April 16, 2022It was unclear at first whether or not Curry would start Game 1, but the Warriors later announced that Curry would come off the bench, with Jordan Poole starting at point guard.
Kerr did say Friday that if Curry was cleared to play in Saturday‚Äôs game, he would be on a minutes restriction.
That won't be the case, as Jordan Poole will get the start along with Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green and Kevon Looney.
When Curry does play during Game 1, he will be returning to court competition for the first time in a month since suffering a sprained left foot and bone bruise.

     Golden State Warriors' Steph Curry will play in Game 1 of playoff series against Denver Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors‚Äô playoff campaign will begin with star Steph Curry in the lineup.
This announcement came from head coach Steve Kerr, who spoke to reporters prior to the team‚Äôs Game 1 matchup against the Denver Nuggets for their opening round playoff series.
Curry had been dealing with a foot injury that kept him out for the final 12 games of the regular season.
It‚Äôs no secret that the Warriors are objectively worse off without Curry on the team.
His presence requires entire defensive game plans to revolve around where he is on the court at all times.
