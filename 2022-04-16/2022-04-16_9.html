     Summary: ‚ÄãIt‚Äôs official: Steph Curry is back.
Steph is playing in Game 1 √∞¬ü¬ë¬è pic.twitter.com/4vAtpQWlDK ‚Äî Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) April 16, 2022It was unclear at first whether or not Curry would start Game 1, but the Warriors later announced that Curry would come off the bench, with Jordan Poole starting at point guard.
Kerr did say Friday that if Curry was cleared to play in Saturday‚Äôs game, he would be on a minutes restriction.
That won't be the case, as Jordan Poole will get the start along with Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green and Kevon Looney.
When Curry does play during Game 1, he will be returning to court competition for the first time in a month since suffering a sprained left foot and bone bruise.

     Golden State Warriors' Steph Curry will play in Game 1 of playoff series against Denver Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors‚Äô playoff campaign will begin with star Steph Curry in the lineup.
This announcement came from head coach Steve Kerr, who spoke to reporters prior to the team‚Äôs Game 1 matchup against the Denver Nuggets for their opening round playoff series.
Curry had been dealing with a foot injury that kept him out for the final 12 games of the regular season.
It‚Äôs no secret that the Warriors are objectively worse off without Curry on the team.
His presence requires entire defensive game plans to revolve around where he is on the court at all times.

     Steph Curry update: Warriors guard to play Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî Stephen Curry will return to the lineup Saturday in Game 1 of the Western Conference quarterfinals against the Denver Nuggets at Chase Center.
Curry, who hasn‚Äôt played since March 16, was listed as ‚Äúprobable‚Äù on the Warriors‚Äô injury report Friday, but coach Steve Kerr said before the game that the All-Star guard would play under a minute restriction, though Kerr wouldn‚Äôt disclose what that would be.
In 112 career playoff games, Curry has averaged close to 38 minutes and 26.5 points per game.
In the second quarter, Curry‚Äôs key minutes came in the closing minutes along with Green, Klay, Poole and Wiggins.
Curry‚Äôs first points came on a goal-tended layup, and his next points came on a wide open 3-pointer in the half‚Äôs final seconds to give the Warriors an 11 point lead heading into the break.
