     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äì Conventional wisdom implies the postseason fate of the Warriors will be dictated by Stephen Curry‚Äôs left foot.
The reality of these Warriors, and whether they rise or fall, is much more complicated.
It‚Äôs longer than that of the Miami Heat or the Memphis Grizzlies or even the Boston Celtics.
And it‚Äôs nothing at all like the Golden State teams that rolled to five consecutive NBA Finals, winning three championships.
That mix, and the problems laid out in plain sight, explain much of what transpired during such an uneven season.
