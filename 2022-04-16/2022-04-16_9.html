     Sixers vs. Raptors: Tyrese Maxey scores scintillating 38 points in blowout Game 1 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The second-year guard scored 38 points Saturday night (including 21 in the third quarter) in a 131-111 Game 1 Sixers win at Wells Fargo Center.
Harden (22 points, 14 assists), Embiid (19 points, 15 rebounds) and Tobias Harris (26 points) were far from unproductive.
However, Maxey was absolutely everything the Sixers wanted in the game’s frenetic, home crowd-fueled opening burst.
The conventional wisdom entering the series was that Toronto’s transition game posed the greater threat, but the Sixers scored the first nine fast-break points Saturday.
Maxey is instinctively a turnover-averse player, and that’s a style which should play well in this series as the Sixers aim to minimize transition damage.

     NBA Playoffs: Tyrese Maxey Dominates, Sixers Snag Game 1 vs. Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During the regular season, the Sixers didn’t find much success against the Raptors, as they won just one of four games.
Tyrese Maxey, who got his first playoff start, created a significant spark in his first ten minutes on the floor.
After going 4-6 from the floor, Maxey led the Sixers in scoring as he put up ten of their 35 first-quarter points.
In the final minutes of the game, the Sixers allowed several reserves to close the game out as the key starters got the rest of the night off.
With Game 1 behind them, the Sixers are now looking forward to Game 2, which will take place in South Philly on Monday night.

     Coaching adjustments are key part of Sixers-Raptors series as Doc Rivers wins Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Among the other important factors are the coaching decisions of Philadelphia's Doc Rivers and Toronto's Nick Nurse.
The Sixers and Raptors have to win three best-of-seven series to reach the 2021-22 Finals, so that'd probably be getting a little ahead of ourselves.
"I mean, I enjoy it," said Rivers before the Sixers' 131-111 Game 1 victory Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center.
"It's a game of adjustments all of the time, but it's also a game of play.
In the wake of the Sixers' 20-point Game 1 win, Harris expects a much closer series going forward.

     Sixers Playoff Bell Ringer: Tyrese Maxey fell to 21st in the draft (LOL)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For one night at least, the Philadelphia 76ers dispelled any worries their supporters might have had about this series against the Toronto Raptors.
Tyrese Maxey: 38 points, 4 rebounds, 2 assists, 0 turnoversTyrese Maxey is 21 years old and was making his first career playoff start Saturday night.
He scored 21 points in the third quarter alone, the highest-scoring playoff quarter for a Sixer since Allen Iverson in 2001.
Youngest Sixer ever to score at least 30 points in a playoff game.
This is the Playoff Tobias the Sixers want and need.

     Instant observations: Tyrese Maxey stars in Sixers' Game 1 win vs. Raptors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tyrese Maxey opened the playoffs with a scintillating performance, pouring in 38 points in a 131-111 Sixers win over the Raptors that never got close in the second half.
Whether it was Khem Birch, Precious Achiuwa, or any number of long Raptors defenders hanging off of him, Embiid was simply better.
With Maxey streaking down the floor in transition and the Sixers looking to stave off a surging Toronto team, Harden hit Maxey with an absolutely ridiculous bounce pass in transition, No.
• In theory, this Raptors team is the sort of group that neutralizes a lot of Tobias Harris' advantages on the offensive end.
Doing it enough times to win a game is not easy for them.
