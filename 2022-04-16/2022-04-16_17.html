     Charles Barkley on James Harden’s ‘no pressure’ claim: ‘Think again’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charles Barkley played eight seasons in Philadelphia and experienced the weight of never winning a championship with the Sixers.
It is why the TNT analyst scoffed at James Harden saying this week that he isn’t feeling any pressure entering the playoffs following his midseason trade from the Nets.
“James Harden, you said you don’t feel no pressure?
“So you can sit — I don’t want to call it deflection or whatever — you got more pressure on you than any player in the playoffs.
Good luck, now, ‘cause my Sixers, I love y’all Sixers and my Suns, but James, don’t tell that lie.”James Harden was traded to Philadelphia midway through the season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ESPN golden boy Stephen A. Smith has pretty much seen it all over the past few decades in the broadcasting industry.
However, the renowned sports analyst still could not help himself the moment he saw what Sixers superstar James Harden decided to wear for his pre-game outfit ahead of Philly’s Game 1 matchup against the Toronto Raptors on Saturday.
Smith was doing his usual pre-game report before he caught a glimpse of Harden’s fit.
To say that Stephen A. didn’t agree with the Sixers star’s wardrobe of choice would be a complete understatement:SAS sees James Harden’s fit and freaks out.
Always the outspoken critic, Smith was quick to come out with his own take on Harden’s outfit.

     Summary: Harden only shot 6-for-17, but he did end up scoring 22 points and he had 14 assists in a Game 1 win over the Toronto Raptors to open the playoffs.
Harden also had one particular highlight pass that will be plastered all over SportsCenter for the next few days.
Harden threw a very long bounce pass to Tyrese Maxey who finished it on the other end and the Sixers were able to build an 88-70 lead off of it.
“I just tried to get the ball to him however I could,” Harden said.
We do a really good job of getting stops and getting the rebound and pushing the ball in transition when we got opportunities.

     Summary: James Harden is going into his first postseason with the Philadelphia 76ers at, or at least near, the edge of the superstar cliff.
In the Sixers' blowout Game 1 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Saturday, Harden dished out 14 assists and created enough open shots for his teammates for that number to have exceeded 20.
Harden finished just two of his 10 shots inside the arc, but here's the number that really matters: One turnover.
I thought he controlled the game," Toronto coach Nick Nurse said of Harden.
Harden said he's going into this season with no pressure, and in a sense that's true.
