     SNL Video: Lizzo Brings Boss Attitude to Quiz Show, Takes Over as 'Mayor'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It turns out that not only is Lizzo 100 percent That Bitch, she’s also 100 percent That Sketch Comedian.
Doing double duty on this week’s Saturday Night Live as both musical guest and host, the hip-hop artist proved herself more than capable of handling everything that’s thrown at her.
Where most sketches of this kind have wild or pointed questions to get laughs, this one rests entirely on Lizzo’s Nicole, who brings it all tumbling down with her willfulness.
After getting a question mostly wrong, then watching Kenny swoop in to pick up the points, Nicole starts grilling the host.
