     10 People Wounded in South Carolina Mall Shooting, Police Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: COLUMBIA, S.C. — A holiday weekend was punctured by violence as 10 people were shot at a crowded South Carolina mall on Saturday and two others were injured in an ensuing stampede during the gunfire, the authorities said.
Two of those wounded were in critical condition, Chief William H. Holbrook of the Columbia Police Department said during a news conference.
The police received a call at 2:03 p.m. about a shooting near the Gap store at the Columbiana Centre mall.
It was unclear what led up to the shooting, but three people were detained, though they had not been charged, Chief Holbrook said.
“We believe that the individuals who were armed knew each other and that some type of conflict occurred that resulted in gunfire.”

     14 injured at Columbia mall with gunfire or while fleeing, no fatalities
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nine people were shot and another five were injured while fleeing a shooting Saturday at Columbiana Centre mall with no deaths, according to the Columbia Police Department.
Investigators believe three people displayed guns inside the mall and investigators are working to determine how many people fired, according to the statement.
Holbrook said the injuries were mostly from gunfire, with victims from age 15 to 73, and several were injured as people were fleeing.
"This was not a situation where someone showed up and at random fired a gun to hurt people," Holbrook said.
The mall released a statement through the police department: “Today’s isolated, senseless act of violence is extremely upsetting and our thoughts are with everyone impacted.
