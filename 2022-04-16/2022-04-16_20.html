     Emoni Bates enters transfer portal: Memphis guard to explore options after underwhelming freshman season

     Summary: After an underwhelming freshman season at Memphis, former five-star prospect Emoni Bates is entering the transfer portal, he announced Saturday on Instagram.
"I'd like to thank Coach Penny, my teammates and the entire coaching staff at the University of Memphis for giving me the opportunity to be a Tiger," Bates wrote.
Though his first season of college basketball fell short of expectations, Bates should have plenty of suitors in the portal.
In his first three games, Bates averaged 16 points on 57.7% shooting and hit 9 of 18 shots from 3-point range.
But as the quality of Memphis' opposition increased, Bates' production decreased, and Memphis ultimately played its best basketball of the season after his injury.
