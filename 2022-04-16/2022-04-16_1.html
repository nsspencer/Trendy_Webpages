     Coachella 2022: How parking at the festival benefits a local school district
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you’re parking at the 2022 Coachella music festival, chances are you might be leaving your car on property owned by a local school district.
Parking is free for Coachella 2022 attendees, but Goldenvoice, the promoter for Coachella and Stagecoach, pays the Coachella Valley Unified School District approximately $200,000 annually to lease 62 acres of land near the festival grounds in Indio to use as parking during its big events.
In addition, Goldenvoice makes an annual donation of $385,000 to the school district to support student programs.
The promoter and the school district entered into a contract in 2018.
Goldenvoice’s music festivals did not take place in 2020 or 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so the promoter did not make payments or donations to the school district those years.

     Summary: But if the crowd was "waiting for the lightning," they quickly started to get it as Butler launched into the companion song, "The Lightning II."
By the end of that song, the crowd was loudly clapping along and Butler was triumphantly holding his guitar above his head.
The crowd reached another level during "Rebellion (Lies)" with many joining in on the iconic "wooh" sound.
The show's emotional zenith came soon after, when Butler stopped to remind the crowd about how Coachella was where Arcade Fire was "introduced to the world in 2005."
By the looks of tonight's set, Coachella is still happy to be that and more with Arcade Fire.
