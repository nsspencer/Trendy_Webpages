     Man City’s Zack Steffen gives up awful goal in FA Cup vs. Liverpool
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A slow start in the FA Cup semifinals against Liverpool only grew worse for Manchester City when goalkeeper Zack Steffen yielded an embarrassing goal in the first half.
Already trailing 1–0 in the 17th minute, the Manchester City defense passed the ball back to Steffen.
Liverpool took a two-nil advantage due to Steffen’s blunder.
To add insult to injury, Steffen’s blunder was eerily similar to a play made by fellow Manchester City keeper Ederson just last week.

     Man City apologise to Liverpool as fans boo Hillsborough silence before FA Cup semifinal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Man City, Liverpool hold moment's silence before FA Cup semifinal in honour of victims of Hillsborough tragedy.
Justin Setterfield - The FA/The FA via Getty ImagesManchester City have apologised to Liverpool after a section of their supporters interrupted a period of silence to mark the Hillsborough tragedy before the FA Cup semifinal Saturday at Wembley.
A pocket of City fans could be heard chanting after referee Michael Oliver blew his whistle to signal a moment's reflection in memory of the 97 Liverpool supporters who died at a 1989 FA Cup semifinal against Nottingham Forest.
The noise triggered an angry reaction from the Liverpool end as boos rang out in response, and a City spokesperson said: "Manchester City are extremely disappointed with the actions of some City supporters during the minute's silence before today's game.
Liverpool won the match 3-2 to reach their first FA Cup final since 2012, while City last won the competition in 2019.

     Manchester City vs. Liverpool score: Reds head to FA Cup final after first-half flurry, Zack Steffen howler
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool booked their spot in the FA Cup final after defeating Manchester City 3-2, a score that is closer than the match actually was.
City, on the other hand, was without Kevin de Bruyne and Kyle Walker after both picked up injuries against Atletico Madrid.
Liverpool went ahead nine minutes into the match as Ibrahima Kounate headed in a corner from Andrew Robertson.
With only one point separating City and Liverpool in the league, every match is a final.
The match does show how hard it is to play your strongest team when competing in all competitions as one off night in quality is all that you need to come crashing out of a cup match.
