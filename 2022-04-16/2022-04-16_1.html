     Man City apologise to Liverpool as fans boo Hillsborough silence before FA Cup semifinal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Man City, Liverpool hold moment's silence before FA Cup semifinal in honour of victims of Hillsborough tragedy.
Justin Setterfield - The FA/The FA via Getty ImagesManchester City have apologised to Liverpool after a section of their supporters interrupted a period of silence to mark the Hillsborough tragedy before the FA Cup semifinal Saturday at Wembley.
A pocket of City fans could be heard chanting after referee Michael Oliver blew his whistle to signal a moment's reflection in memory of the 97 Liverpool supporters who died at a 1989 FA Cup semifinal against Nottingham Forest.
The noise triggered an angry reaction from the Liverpool end as boos rang out in response, and a City spokesperson said: "Manchester City are extremely disappointed with the actions of some City supporters during the minute's silence before today's game.
Liverpool won the match 3-2 to reach their first FA Cup final since 2012, while City last won the competition in 2019.

     Soccer-Liverpool hang on for 3-2 FA Cup semi win over City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (Reuters) – Liverpool hung on to beat Manchester City 3-2 at Wembley Stadium on Saturday to reach the final of the FA Cup and end Pep Guardiola’s hopes of a treble.
Although City scored at the start and end of the second half their weakened line-up never really did enough to win the game against opponents they drew 2-2 with in the Premier League last week.
For City it was the third straight season in which they have lost in the last four of the FA Cup.
Difficult to come back but they did it perfectly in the second half,” he added.
Liverpool remain in contention for four trophies having won the League Cup, reached the semi-finals of the Champions League and still being in the race for the Premier League title where they sit a point behind leaders City.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: City hit back with second half goals from Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva, but it wasn't enough to stop the Reds reaching their first FA Cup final since 2012.
They shared a pulsating 2-2 draw in Manchester in the league last weekend, and could still meet in the Champions League final.
Asked if their FA Cup semi-final success could be the springboard to pip City in both the Premier League and Champions League, Klopp said: "It's not a statement, we are just in the final.
"In three days we play against United, who are fighting for a Champions League place.
In the second half we showed incredible pride when you talk about being tired.

     Liverpool-Manchester City: Jurgen Klopp’s side dominates in FA Cup semifinal

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the Brazilian’s shot was deflected over the bar by Virgil van Dijk and Liverpool’s 3–2 lead in the FA Cup semifinal was preserved.
After last week’s 2–2 draw in the league, City still holds a one-point lead in the Premier League title race, while if both win their semifinals, they will meet for a fourth time this season in the Champions League final.
Liverpool has already won the League Cup and becomes only the 11th side ever to reach both domestic Cup finals in the same season.
“Manchester City are extremely disappointed with the actions of some City supporters during the minute’s silence before today’s game,” a club statement read.
But the real finale could come in the Champions League final in Paris next month.

Jota and Firmino are on, so there'll be no respite for the City defence, but Liverpool are almost there.
Again the City goalkeeper looks horribly unsure with the ball at his feet and Mane virtually slide tackles the ball home.
