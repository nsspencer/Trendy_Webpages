The 64-win Phoenix Suns are the favorite to come out of the Western Conference, but there are several teams like the blue-blood Golden State Warriors and upstart Memphis Grizzlies ready to ruin their journey.
And then there's the Brooklyn Nets, once the favorite to win the title, with one of the most proficient offensive duos in the NBA in Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.

With so much action to focus on, we've ranked the first-round matchups from least exciting to most.
This series really had the potential to be exciting, but the calf strain of Luka Doncic has really dampened that.

As Toronto got closer and closer to clinching a playoff spot in March and April, coach Nick Nurse spoke about how important it was for his team to get experience in the postseason.
And then, in the fourth quarter, Scottie Barnes, having a sublime playoff debut, especially considering the score, went to stop Joel Embiid’s path to the rim.
The mammoth MVP candidate’s left leg wound up coming down on the precocious rookie’s left ankle.
