     Summary: A search is underway for a male passenger who jumped overboard from the Carnival Mardi Gras early Saturday morning, the cruise line and Coast Guard confirmed to USA TODAY.
He said the Mardi Gras and another Carnival ship, Elation, began searching immediately.
The Coast Guard brought in two cutters, the Heron and Ibis, as well as fixed-wing aircraft to continue the search.
Mardi Gras arrived to Port Canaveral and will be sailing its next itinerary," the cruise line said in a statement.
Mardi Gras, Carnival's flagship, began sailing Caribbean routes in the summer of 2021, after its launch was delayed for a season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
