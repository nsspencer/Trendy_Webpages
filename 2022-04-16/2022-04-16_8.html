    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For just the 2nd time in the last 10 years, Steph Curry came off the bench.
The announcement that Curry would not start Game 1 vs. the Denver Nuggets came just minutes before tip-off, as it was initially reported that he would start.
After the game, Steve Kerr revealed his thought process.
When asked about bringing Steph off the bench, Kerr confirmed that he wanted to avoid having Steph sit for extended stretches, and instead wanted to better manage the precise minutes he would receive.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In his NBA Playoffs debut, young Golden State Warriors guard Jordan Poole went for 30 points on 9/13 from the field and 5/7 from deep.
It was a fantastic performance for the rising star, who according to Kevon Looney, has been asking Warriors veterans about the playoffs since his rookie year.
That acquired knowledge was on full display in this game, as Poole led Golden State to a Game 1 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
When asked after the game about the playoff advice he has received from Steph Curry and other Warriors veterans, Poole said, "It was good to just get the first one under the belt.

     Joe Lacob: Warriors' mix of veterans, youth will prevent falling 'off cliff'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors' success over the past decade has been a direct translation of the decisions made in the front office.
In the 2014-15 season, the All-Star trio of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green led the Warriors to their first NBA Finals since 1975.
Fast-forward seven seasons to present day, and the NBA world has learned that the Warriors are so much more than the Steph-Klay-Dray trio.
It’s been players like Jordan Poole and rookies Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody who have electrified the league this season.
The point is these guys got experience, it worked out to their advantage, Kuminga, Moody got experience, Jordan Poole, I mean, exploded right?

They were getting all the loose balls, 50-50 balls, second-chance points, offensive rebounding.
“My friend, I think I’m going to get fined if I answer, so I can’t,” Jokic said.
“We can’t keep letting them beat us to loose balls and getting second-chance points and things of that nature,” Barton said.

     Summary: Steph Curry returns to the lineup as the Warriors pick up a 123-107 win over the Nuggets in Game 1.
During the first championship run of their dynastic era, their small lineup was so lethal it was dubbed the "death lineup."
And it was those five minutes that shifted the momentum to the Warriors going into halftime of their eventual 123-107 win on Saturday night.
In the three games he played against the Nuggets, Poole averaged 22.7 points, 58% shooting from the field and 61% shooting from the 3-point line.
The spacing Curry created was especially apparent playing in the Warriors' three-guard lineup with Poole and Thompson.

Stephen Curry added 16 points in 22 minutes off the bench after missing the previous 12 games with a left foot injury.
Curry’s timing was off as he finished 5-of-13 shooting in his first action since March 16.
Nikola Jokic registered 25 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for Denver.
Will Barton added 24 points for the Nuggets, who didn’t play like the squad that won three of four regular-season outings against the Warriors.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO -- After yet another trademark Golden State Warriors third-quarter run, Stephen Curry walked toward the stands, gesticulating desperately for the home fans to get louder.
"It was almost because the lead was so big, you lose the anxiousness of the moment, and that's where you remind yourself like, this is a playoff game.
"The tree is becoming part of another tree," Yang says.
The quintet has more titles than an 18th-century British noble, and all of their skills and quirks were on display in the Game 1 win.
The only thing on the Warriors' minds is Monday's Game 2 against Denver.

What a star in the making.”The perimeter combination of Curry, Poole and Thompson proved too much for the Nuggets — with Poole acknowledging “it’s pretty lethal."
I think the key stretch was the end of the second quarter," Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.
Warriors: Looney, who played all 82 regular-season games, grabbed seven boards as the Warriors led on rebounds 41-35.
The Warriors went 6-6 down the stretch without Curry, winning their final five regular-season games.
