     Errol Spence Jr. stays unbeaten, stops Yordenis Ugas in 10th to unify welterweight titles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ARLINGTON, Texas -- Errol Spence Jr. was dazed as he peered around the ring looking for his mouthpiece.
Errol Spence was ahead on all three scorecards at the time of the stoppage: 88-82, 88-83 and 88-82.
With the victory, Spence (28-0, 22 KOs) added Ugas' WBA welterweight title along with the WBC and IBF titles he already owned.
The delay appeared to allow Spence, 32, to recover; he began firing punches at Ugas after the bout resumed.
All that remains for Spence in the welterweight division, of course, is a long-awaited meeting with Crawford.
