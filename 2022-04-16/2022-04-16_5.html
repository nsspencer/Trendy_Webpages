     Uneven Jazz top Luka Doncic-less Mavericks in Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Really, the Mavericks – with tight defense against the NBA’s best regular-season offense – showed impressive resolve given the circumstances.
Up 11 with fewer than six minutes left, Utah – which has developed a troubling habit of blowing leads – let Dallas get within one.
Without Doncic, Dallas ran its offense through Jalen Brunson (24 points and five assists) and Spencer Dinwiddie (22 points and eight assists).
Staying big when Dallas went smaller, the Jazz ignored Jalen Green, who might not have cracked the playoff rotation if Doncic were healthy.
Green (0-for-4 on 3-pointers, zero points in 10 minutes) did not make Utah pay.

     Summary: Luka Dončić was officially ruled out of Saturday night’s Game 1 vs. the Jazz, per The Dallas Morning News.
The Mavericks star has been dealing with a left calf strain since Sunday, April 10 during Dallas’s last regular season game vs. the Spurs.
Game 2 is set to be played on Monday, and Dončić’s status for that game is still unknown.
Kidd will most likely announce Dončić’s status on Monday morning as he did for Game 1.

     Luka Doncic’s message to Mavs during Game 1 comeback bid vs. Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Luka Doncic sat out Saturday’s Game 1 against the Utah Jazz, he still played a key role in helping the Dallas Mavericks put up a valiant fight until the end.
Doncic was on the bench for the Mavs as they faced off against the Jazz.
According to Dorian Finney-Smith, Luka’s message helped him and the rest of the Mavs stay focused on the game and their main goal.
“When they was up nine or eight in the fourth quarter, [Luka] was telling us we still can win the game,” Finney-Smith shared, per Callie Caplan of the Dallas Morning News.
Still, the way they played is an encouraging sign, as they proved they can compete even without their best player.

     Luka Doncic (calf strain) misses Game 1 loss to Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic was sidelined for the Dallas Mavericks’ 99-93 Game 1 loss to the Utah Jazz in their playoff series on Saturday because of the left calf strain the All-Star guard suffered in the regular-season finale.
Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said before the opener of the best-of-seven series that Doncic is day to day.
Doncic finished the regular season as the NBA’s third-leading scorer at 28.4 points per game.
He wouldn’t have been able to play in that finale against the Spurs if the NBA hasn’t rescinded the 16th technical foul that Doncic got in the second-to-last regular-season game April 8.
“We prepared for Luka for this whole series,” Jazz guard Mike Conley said.

     How the Dallas Mavericks are feeling after their near-win in Game 1 without Luka Doncic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Throughout the week leading up to Game 1 of the first-round playoff series between the Dallas Mavericks and Utah Jazz, there was great debate about how the Mavericks would fare in the likelihood that All-Star Luka Doncic couldn’t play.
Doncic had suffered a calf strain in Dallas’ regular season finale last Sunday, and while some thought the Mavericks would have enough talent without him, many didn’t.
After Game 1 Saturday at American Airlines Center in Dallas, both camps could reasonably make the argument that they are correct.
ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski has reported that Doncic will likely miss Game 2 on Monday in Dallas also, with Mavericks officially saying that the Slovenian superstar is day-to-day.
“The things that we did defensively without Luka being able to rebound for us and participate defensively, I thought the game plan was great,” Kidd said.

     Mavericks vs. Jazz Game 1: Dallas can't replicate Luka Doncic, redemption for Rudy Gobert among key takeaways
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Give the Dallas Mavericks credit.
Once it became clear that they would be playing Game 1 of their first-round series against the Utah Jazz without Luka Doncic, they easily could've folded.
So as the Mavericks try to regroup for Game 2, let's take a look back at Game 1.
But the Mavericks have grown extremely dependent on Doncic in recent years, and that was on full display in this game.
Nobody is going to give Gobert credit for locking down the Mavericks without Doncic.
