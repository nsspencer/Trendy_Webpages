     Summary: After an 82-game regular season and a riveting play-in tournament, the 2022 NBA Playoffs have finally begun.
While the NBA doesn't often see many major first-round upsets, this year we have some intriguing matchups that could lead to some unexpected results.
The Nets were a preseason favorite to win the title, but endured injuries, part-time players and a mid-season trade that led them to a disappointing regular season.
They showed off their firepower in the play-in win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, however, with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving comprising anything but a normal seventh seed.
With the playoffs set to begin on Saturday, our CBS Sports NBA experts have taken a stab at predicting every first-round series.

     Summary: The regular season is in the books, and the play-in tournament is over which means it's time for the 2022 NBA playoffs.
Several of these series have the potential to go the full seven games, while a couple others may be four-game sweeps.
With so much action to focus on, we've ranked the first-round matchups from least exciting to most.
This series really had the potential to be exciting, but the calf strain of Luka Doncic has really dampened that.
Oh and then there's the potential for Ben Simmons to make his long-awaited season debut.

No player is going to benefit more from his first exposure on the national stage, both on and off the court.
Shelburne: How bold is it to suggest the second-seeded team in the East wins its first-round playoff matchup?
