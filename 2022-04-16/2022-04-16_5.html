     Summary: Shaka Hislop finds it bemusing that a struggling Man United side may yet qualify for the Champions League.
(1:28)Cristiano Ronaldo's 50th club career hat trick, which including a stunning late free kick earned Manchester United a 3-2 win over Norwich City at Old Trafford on Saturday which just about kept their top-four hopes alive.
On Friday, United fans staged a protest against the ownership outside the clubs Carrington training ground and that continued before the clash with Norwich as thousands of supporters marched outside the ground.
7 got his second just after the half hour mark as he headed past Norwich goalkeeper Tim Krul from a corner.
Following the match, United goalkeeper David de Gea said Ronaldo's treble had meant United can still challenge for a top-four finish but called on his side to give more.

     Summary: To find out, we used FIFA 22 to get a score prediction for Manchester United vs Norwich on Saturday.
Man United vs Norwich City score predicted by simulationTo get a score prediction, we used kick-off mode in FIFA 22, but didn't select a team to control, letting the AI play against each other.
Dean Smith's side started to push forward with intent after the United goal, but it only seemed to allow United to look more dangerous in attack.
Despite their attempts to push forward, Norwich failed to trouble United, with De Gea only forced into making two simple saves throughout the game.
What do you think the final score will be?
