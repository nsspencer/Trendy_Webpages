By the end of that song, the crowd was loudly clapping along and Butler was triumphantly holding his guitar above his head.
The crowd reached another level during "Rebellion (Lies)" with many joining in on the iconic "wooh" sound.
The show's emotional zenith came soon after, when Butler stopped to remind the crowd about how Coachella was where Arcade Fire was "introduced to the world in 2005."
