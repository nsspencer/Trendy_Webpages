     Charles Barkley on James Harden’s ‘no pressure’ claim: ‘Think again’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charles Barkley played eight seasons in Philadelphia and experienced the weight of never winning a championship with the Sixers.
It is why the TNT analyst scoffed at James Harden saying this week that he isn’t feeling any pressure entering the playoffs following his midseason trade from the Nets.
“James Harden, you said you don’t feel no pressure?
“So you can sit — I don’t want to call it deflection or whatever — you got more pressure on you than any player in the playoffs.
Good luck, now, ‘cause my Sixers, I love y’all Sixers and my Suns, but James, don’t tell that lie.”James Harden was traded to Philadelphia midway through the season.

     Summary: James Harden has been straightforward with the media since he arrived in Philadelphia.

When asked if he felt any added pressure given the context of his career and the circumstances of his trade to the Sixers, Harden was succinct again.
I’m ready to hoop.”The optimal version of Harden showing up this postseason would take pressure off everyone in the Sixers’ organization.
