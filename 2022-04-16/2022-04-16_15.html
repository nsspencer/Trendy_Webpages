     10 People Wounded in South Carolina Mall Shooting, Police Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: COLUMBIA, S.C. — A holiday weekend was punctured by violence as 10 people were shot at a crowded South Carolina mall on Saturday and two others were injured in an ensuing stampede during the gunfire, the authorities said.
Two of those wounded were in critical condition, Chief William H. Holbrook of the Columbia Police Department said during a news conference.
The police received a call at 2:03 p.m. about a shooting near the Gap store at the Columbiana Centre mall.
It was unclear what led up to the shooting, but three people were detained, though they had not been charged, Chief Holbrook said.
“We believe that the individuals who were armed knew each other and that some type of conflict occurred that resulted in gunfire.”

     Summary: Twelve people were injured after a shooting at a South Carolina shopping mall, including 10 people who were shot and two injured in a "stampede," police said Saturday afternoon.
Police in Columbia, South Carolina's capital city, responded to reports of shots fired at the Columbiana Centre mall, about 10 miles from downtown Columbia.
Holbrook said police believe the three armed people knew each other and shots were fired after an altercation.
"We don't believe this was random," Holbrook said.
Holbrook said police were continuing to evacuate people from the mall, where employees and customers sheltered inside stores after officers did an initial sweep to find anyone injured.
