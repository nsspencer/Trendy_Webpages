     Zion Williamson disagrees with Pelicans that he's not ready to play
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Williamson keeps throwing down highlight dunks where everyone can see them – on Instagram, during pre-play-in-game warmups.
In case you didn’t get his message…Andrew Lopez of ESPN:According to multiple sources, there’s currently a difference of opinion between the Pelicans and Williamson on whether he is healthy enough to play.
The team maintains that the bone in Williamson’s foot hasn’t healed enough for him to take the floor.
Remember, Williamson reportedly thought he was ready to return sooner than the team did his rookie year.
But if Williamson wanted to play sooner, he could have rehabbed more diligently.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Williamson is yet to demand a trade from the Pelicans, but he would definitely be intrigued by the idea of being traded to the Knicks this summer.
Williamson's interest in playing for the Knicks has been one of the worst-kept secrets in the league.
In 2019, Ian Begley of SportsNet New York reported that Williamson was hoping that the Knicks would get the No.
Honestly, I think outside of New Orleans, obviously, I think this might be my favorite place to play outside of New Orleans.
I can't even lie to you, can't lie to you."

     Summary: Zion Williamson is looking to make his return in the playoffs for the New Orleans Pelicans © Chuck Cook-USA TODAY SportsLike any other NBA player, Zion Williamson had aspirations of becoming a basketball superstar at a young age.
She was a former track star at Livingston College, but more importantly, she was Williamson's first basketball coach.
Zion's toughest coach is his motherWilliamson made sure that Sampson's efforts on him did not go to waste in college.
"My mom, to this day, is the hardest coach I've ever had," Williamson said in an interview with the NBA in 2020.
However, Pelicans head coach Willie Green confirmed that the 21-year-old has already participated in "controlled scrimmages" with assistant coaches and players earlier this month.
