     Summary: But with the playoffs right around the corner, Sixers head coach Doc Rivers made some concerning comments illustrating his team clearly still has some kinks to work out.
That’s a concerning issue for the 76ers, who will have to decide this offseason whether Harden is worth signing to another contract.
“I think this is really good,” Rivers told reporters this week, per Keith Pompey of The Philadelphia Inquirer.
As for Harden, Rivers doesn’t think he’s up to speed just yet.
“I think he’s getting it,” Rivers said.

     Philadelphia 76ers: Unleash the James Harden-Joel Embiid Pick-and-Roll
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Only time will tell, but if the Philadelphia 76ers want to have any chance at pulling out the W, they’ll need to unleash arguably the greatest play in their arsenal, the James Harden–Joel Embiid pick-and-roll, regardless of how the Raptors decide to cover it.
The Philadelphia 76ers need to get the most out of their best players offensively.
Defending the pick-and-roll is tough, especially when it’s run by a team like the Philadelphia 76ers with two dominant scorers like Joel Embiid and James Harden.
In previous offensive schemes, picking a way to defend a Harden or Embiid pick-and-roll was largely based on slowing down either star player.
When the Philadelphia 76ers have their starting lineup on the court, they tend to outscore their foes by a pretty impressive margin – 20.2 points per 100 possessions, according to the Net Rating, to be specific.

     Summary: ‘The Philadelphia 76ers just aren’t built to defeat the Toronto Raptors.
Philadelphia 76ers fans will be talking about Tyrese Maxey for a very long time.
The Toronto Raptors are a tall, switchable team capable of running all sorts of exotic defensive coverages and beating teams in a variety of different ways.
What they don’t have, however, is an answer for Tyrese Maxey, and that, my friends, was the difference between an upset win, a close loss, and the final results of the game, a 20 point win by the Philadelphia 76ers.
Will Tyrese Maxey be able to follow it up in Game 2?

     Summary: In Game 1 on Saturday night, however, it was another 76ers guard who stole the show.
It was the latest emphatic reminder of just how far Maxey has progressed in his second season.
While Maxey's speed was apparent last year as a rookie, it's his improved jump shot that has opened up his game.
The Sixers typically play slower than their opponents, but Maxey helped key their transition game Saturday, as Philadelphia made a concerted effort to get out and run.
"It was a great game individually for some guys," Harden said.
