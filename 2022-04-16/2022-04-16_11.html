     Man United vs Norwich live score and result updates: Ronaldo hat-trick gives hosts win in tight Premier League contest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cristiano Ronaldo netted a hat-trick to hand Manchester United a huge boost in their hunt for Champions League qualification as the Red Devils defeated Norwich 3-2 at Old Trafford.
The Portuguese gave the hosts the lead after just seven minutes when Anthony Elanga dispossessed Norwich defender Ben Gibson in his own penalty box before Ronaldo tapped into an empty net.
The Red Devils then doubled their lead when talisman Ronaldo rose highest of all to divert Alex Telles' in-swinging corner past Tim Krul just after the half-hour mark.
But Ronaldo ensured the Red Devils would be taking all three points when he produced a stunning free-kick - giving Krul no chance - with just 14 minutes remaining.
Victory for Ralf Rangnick's side mean they are now just four points behind Tottenham in fourth place, while Norwich remain rooted at the bottom of the Premier League table and trail 17th-placed Everton by seven points.
