     Watch Lizzo Debut Vulnerable New Single ‘Special’ on ‘SNL’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While pulling double duty as host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live this week, Lizzo debuted “Special,” the title track from her forthcoming album.
In a bright pink dress, Lizzo belted out the slow-burning R&amp;B track against a wall of twinkling LED lights.
During the evening, she also delivered a disco-tinged performance of her recent single “About Damn Time.” Alongside four dancers in neon bodysuits, Lizzo delivered an energetic rendition of the retro track.
The singer also took a break from singing for a solo on her flute, “Sasha Flute.”Lizzo’s appearance on SNL comes just days after the singer announced that she would be releasing her sophomore album Special on July 15.
Before “About Damn Time,” Lizzo shared the Cardi B-assisted “Rumors” in 2021.

I used to live in my car and now I'm hosting 'Saturday Night Live,' she closed.
Later in the night, Lizzo excitedly announced herself as the musical guest before taking the stage to perform the groovy new summer anthem "About Damn Time."

     Lizzo Cracks Up During ‘SNL’ Hosting Debut, Brings Twerking &amp; Flute Skills To Sketch Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rapper-singer Lizzo made her SNL hosting debut, cracking up throughout the night.
Lizzo brings it home with one last crack-up during a final Beanie Baby-centric sketch.
But just before Dismukes topples the stuffed animal-filled shelf, Lizzo breaks character and giggles while speaking about the toys.
Even with the out-of-character laughs, the latest SNL installment was quintessentially Lizzo – with the singer playing the flute, twerking and even doing both simultaneously.
The singer’s hosting debut also touted two new songs and multiple appearances by her mother, who introduced the second performance.

     SNL recap: Season 47, Episode 18, Lizzo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unfortunately, SNL’s writing staff didn’t bother to show up for her episode this week.
AdvertisementThis was the worst “Weekend Update” of the season, and maybe longer—the writing was anemic to lazy to occasionally depressing.
A decent premise, but last week’s “Spring Flowers” sketch indicated this writing staff isn’t sophisticated enough to go there, and things ended up worse than anticipated.
But this sketch shows a fundamental miscalculation about sexual humor that’s bad enough to be a fireable offense.
The writing staff was overhauled for season 47.
