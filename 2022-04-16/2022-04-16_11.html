     Coachella 2022: Arcade Fire, 'grown up' and reflective, returns to Coachella with emotional set
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But if the crowd was "waiting for the lightning," they quickly started to get it as Butler launched into the companion song, "The Lightning II."
By the end of that song, the crowd was loudly clapping along and Butler was triumphantly holding his guitar above his head.
The crowd reached another level during "Rebellion (Lies)" with many joining in on the iconic "wooh" sound.
The show's emotional zenith came soon after, when Butler stopped to remind the crowd about how Coachella was where Arcade Fire was "introduced to the world in 2005."
By the looks of tonight's set, Coachella is still happy to be that and more with Arcade Fire.

     Summary: A first-time performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is a dream come true for many people, and the experience still doesn't feel real for Southern California native DJ/producer VNSSA.
After high school, I started playing drums randomly and I met this girl playing guitar and we were like, 'let's start a band.'
We started playing shows here and there, but we never got really big or anything.
Then I started going to clubs, festivals and DJ shows and I was like, 'I can be the whole band myself.'
