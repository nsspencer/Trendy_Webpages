     Tom Hanks &amp; 'Castaway' Co-Star Wilson Throw the First Pitch at Guardians Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Hanks is getting some very unhelpful assistance.
The 65-year-old Castaway star was joined by his “co-star,” the volleyball named Wilson from the movie, while throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at the home opener for the Cleveland Guardians on Friday (April 15).
Wilson had the Cleveland Guardians’ logo featured.
However, as Tom wound up to throw the pitch, Wilson rolled down the mound.
Eventually, he ignored the volleyball and threw the first pitch to Larry Doby Jr. as the crowd cheered.
