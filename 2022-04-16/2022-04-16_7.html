    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In his NBA Playoffs debut, young Golden State Warriors guard Jordan Poole went for 30 points on 9/13 from the field and 5/7 from deep.
It was a fantastic performance for the rising star, who according to Kevon Looney, has been asking Warriors veterans about the playoffs since his rookie year.
That acquired knowledge was on full display in this game, as Poole led Golden State to a Game 1 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
When asked after the game about the playoff advice he has received from Steph Curry and other Warriors veterans, Poole said, "It was good to just get the first one under the belt.

     Warriors' Jordan Poole dazzles vs. Nuggets in Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In those 14 minutes, the Warriors outscored the Nuggets by 10 – a +34-per-48-minutes pace.
Jordan Poole – who arrived after the Warriors’ NBA Finals run ended – scored 30 points in his playoff debut to lead Golden State to a 123-107 win over Denver in Game 1 of their first-round series Saturday.
A rusty Curry scored 16 points in 22 minutes off the bench in his first game back from a foot injury.
Green (12 points, nine assists, six rebounds and three blocks) played his customary quietly highly effective game this time of year.
The Warriors made it a long night for potential MVP Nikola Jokic, who was frequently dragged into actions defensively.

     Joe Lacob: Warriors' mix of veterans, youth will prevent falling 'off cliff'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors' success over the past decade has been a direct translation of the decisions made in the front office.
In the 2014-15 season, the All-Star trio of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green led the Warriors to their first NBA Finals since 1975.
Fast-forward seven seasons to present day, and the NBA world has learned that the Warriors are so much more than the Steph-Klay-Dray trio.
It’s been players like Jordan Poole and rookies Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody who have electrified the league this season.
The point is these guys got experience, it worked out to their advantage, Kuminga, Moody got experience, Jordan Poole, I mean, exploded right?

     Summary: Jordan Poole exploded for 30 points as the Golden State Warriors rolled to an easy 123-107 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Saturday in the opening contest of their Western Conference first-round series at San Francisco.
Stephen Curry added 16 points in 22 minutes off the bench after missing the previous 12 games with a left foot injury.
Curry’s timing was off as he finished 5-of-13 shooting in his first action since March 16.
Nikola Jokic registered 25 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for Denver.
Will Barton added 24 points for the Nuggets, who didn’t play like the squad that won three of four regular-season outings against the Warriors.
