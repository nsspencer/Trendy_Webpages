     Nuggets' DeMarcus Cousins ejected vs. Warriors in fourth quarter of Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeMarcus Cousins was cheered by Warriors fans on Saturday, but it wasn’t for the reason he would’ve liked.
Cousins, the one-time Warrior and now a member of the Denver Nuggets, was ejected in Game 1 at Chase Center after arguing with the officials and picking up two quick technical fouls in succession in the fourth quarter.
It’s unclear what Cousins said while the Nuggets were on defense, but the veteran official Scott Foster rang him up and sent him to the locker room with 10:28 left in the fourth quarter and the Warriors up 92-76.
He spent the 2018-19 season with the Warriors and played during the NBA Finals, but injuries prevented him from fully participating in the playoffs that season.
Cousins had seven points, two rebounds and two assists in 10 minutes before he was tossed.

     Jordan Poole Reveals Advice Steph Curry and Warriors Veterans Gave Him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In his NBA Playoffs debut, young Golden State Warriors guard Jordan Poole went for 30 points on 9/13 from the field and 5/7 from deep.
It was a fantastic performance for the rising star, who according to Kevon Looney, has been asking Warriors veterans about the playoffs since his rookie year.
That acquired knowledge was on full display in this game, as Poole led Golden State to a Game 1 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
When asked after the game about the playoff advice he has received from Steph Curry and other Warriors veterans, Poole said, "It was good to just get the first one under the belt.

What a star in the making.”The perimeter combination of Curry, Poole and Thompson proved too much for the Nuggets — with Poole acknowledging “it’s pretty lethal."
I think the key stretch was the end of the second quarter," Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.
Warriors: Looney, who played all 82 regular-season games, grabbed seven boards as the Warriors led on rebounds 41-35.
The Warriors went 6-6 down the stretch without Curry, winning their final five regular-season games.
