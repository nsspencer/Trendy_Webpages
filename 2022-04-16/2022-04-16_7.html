     Josh Brolin Wants To Play An Elderly DC Hero
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Nathan Kamal | 13 seconds agoJosh Brolin has played more comic book characters than the average square-jawed marquee idol.
Specifically, Josh Brolin would like to play Batman as an even older, grizzled version of the Dark Knight, and it sounds like he almost got the chance to do so once before.
Honestly, an elderly version of the Batman played by a grizzled, raspy Josh Brolin is pretty intriguing.
This would also not be the first time we have seen an elderly version of Batman in the last few years.
Josh Brolin is also heavily rumored to be popping back up in the MCU in some capacity soon, either in his previous role as Thanos or crossing over from X-Men properties as Cable.

     Josh Brolin Reflects On Almost Playing Batman &amp; Losing Out To Ben Affleck
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Brolin has revealed he almost was cast as Batman in Zack Snyder’s superhero films and shares his reaction to losing out to Ben Affleck, who portrayed the caped crusader in Snyder’s Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League follow-up.
Brolin said the idea “was interesting” to him, but as for Snyder’s eventual choice, “That was his decision, that wasn’t my decision.”“Honestly, that would have been a fun deal,” Brolin added.
He recently appeared at Deadline’s Contenders TV to talk about his role in Prime Video’s Outer Range supernatural Western series, which he also executive produces.
He’s also an executive producer on George and Tammy, an upcoming country music drama series co-produced by Spectrum Originals and Paramount Network.
Affleck is set to appear again as Batman in Warner Bros. upcoming The Flash.

     Josh Brolin Almost Was Batman – Actor Regrets Losing the Role
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Brolin has surprised fans when he commented in an interview that he almost played Batman.
The actor would have played the character in Zack Snyder’s post-Justice League film version, which eventually settled on actor Ben Affleck.
Josh Brolin already has a place of honor in pop culture thanks to his role as Thanos in the last two Avengers installments.
Before the cancellation of the movie, the actor commented “That was his decision — that wasn’t my decision.
That was his decision.”As an amusing anecdote of the interview, Brolin commented about George Clooney’s version of Batman, in Batman and Robin from 1997.

     Summary: Josh Brolin revealed how much Avengers: Age of Ultron changed during post-production.
Brolin appeared next in Avengers: Age of Ultron where he finally made it clear that he's going after the Infinity Stones.
This effectively set up his role in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, the two movies that concluded the Infinity Saga in electrifying fashion.
It's no secret that the production for Avengers: Age of Ultron had some issues.
He may never be a prominent player again in the franchise, but an Avengers: Age of Ultron-type of cameo would be more than enough to excite viewers.

Brolin would finish the Batman conversation by saying, “It would have been the older, the more raspy, for lack of a better word.
There was a ton of fan art of Brolin as Batman at the time.
Image via Warner Bros.RELATED: Exclusive: Josh Brolin on 'Dune 2' and Denis Villeneuve's Oscars SnubBrolin would have made a great Batman, but then we would have not gotten Batflek or even Robert Pattinson in the role.
Also as Brolin joked about, we could see him end up being the iconic character when he is 80.

     Josh Brolin Reveals He Was Almost Tapped to Play Batman Pre-Ben Affleck
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Play video content Happy Sad ConfusedJosh Brolin just made comic fanboys' brains explode -- he says he was almost set to play the Dark Knight once upon a time ... that is, until the director went with Ben Affleck instead.
Brolin confirmed ... yes, Zack Snyder had, in fact, approached him as he was ramping up for 'Batman v Superman' -- and it sounds like JB was onboard and fully willing to do it.
Lots of changes are on the horizon ... including Discovery honchos reportedly wanting to overhaul the DCEU.
That entails revisiting and revitalizing staple characters (like Superman) and perhaps further down the line ... maybe Batman again too.
Robert Pattinson seems to be in the driver's seat for now -- but if Discovery wants to take another swing at 'TDR,' Brolin might be their man.
