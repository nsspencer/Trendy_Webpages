     Jordan Poole Reveals Advice Steph Curry and Warriors Veterans Gave Him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In his NBA Playoffs debut, young Golden State Warriors guard Jordan Poole went for 30 points on 9/13 from the field and 5/7 from deep.
It was a fantastic performance for the rising star, who according to Kevon Looney, has been asking Warriors veterans about the playoffs since his rookie year.
That acquired knowledge was on full display in this game, as Poole led Golden State to a Game 1 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
When asked after the game about the playoff advice he has received from Steph Curry and other Warriors veterans, Poole said, "It was good to just get the first one under the belt.

     Summary: For just the 2nd time in the last 10 years, Steph Curry came off the bench.
The announcement that Curry would not start Game 1 vs. the Denver Nuggets came just minutes before tip-off, as it was initially reported that he would start.
After the game, Steve Kerr revealed his thought process.
When asked about bringing Steph off the bench, Kerr confirmed that he wanted to avoid having Steph sit for extended stretches, and instead wanted to better manage the precise minutes he would receive.

     Joe Lacob: Warriors' mix of veterans, youth will prevent falling 'off cliff'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors' success over the past decade has been a direct translation of the decisions made in the front office.
In the 2014-15 season, the All-Star trio of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green led the Warriors to their first NBA Finals since 1975.
Fast-forward seven seasons to present day, and the NBA world has learned that the Warriors are so much more than the Steph-Klay-Dray trio.
It’s been players like Jordan Poole and rookies Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody who have electrified the league this season.
The point is these guys got experience, it worked out to their advantage, Kuminga, Moody got experience, Jordan Poole, I mean, exploded right?

     Summary: The Warriors scored 21 points off the 11 turnovers and racked up 20 second-chance points.
“We can’t beat ourselves and the Warriors in the same game, and we did that tonight,” Malone said.
They were getting all the loose balls, 50-50 balls, second-chance points, offensive rebounding.
“My friend, I think I’m going to get fined if I answer, so I can’t,” Jokic said.
“We can’t keep letting them beat us to loose balls and getting second-chance points and things of that nature,” Barton said.

     Summary: Those issues slowly went away, and a big reason why was Steve Kerr's new Death Lineup of Steph Curry, Jordan Poole, Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green.
Whether it be as a starter or off the bench, Poole proved he can thrive in any role for the Warriors this season.
In the 12 games that Curry missed to end the regular season, Poole averaged 25.8 points.
He scored 17 points and was a perfect 6-for-6 from the field.
The Warriors went into halftime with a 58-47 lead.

     Why Jordan Poole's 30-point NBA playoff debut didn't surprise Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO -- Jordan Poole being introduced as the Warriors' starting point guard instead of Steph Curry for Game 1 of the Warriors' first-round playoff series with the Denver Nuggets certainly came as a surprise.
Poole's 30 points are tied with Hall of Famer Mitch Richmond for the second-most scored by a Warrior in a playoff debut.
Poole became the 35th player in NBA history to score at least 30 points in a playoff debut.
Klay Thompson, who served as Poole's backcourt mate and scored 19 points in his first playoff game since tearing his ACL in Game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals, has long had Poole's back.
From the moment the Warriors drafted Poole near the end of the first round in 2019, Thompson saw the potential.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors are back in the playoffs for the first time since the 2019 NBA Finals.
Squaring off against the Denver Nuggest and the reigning MVP Nikola Jokic at Chase Center Saturday night, the Golden State Warriors finally played their first game with their full complement of rotation players all season long, after Draymond Green went down just as Klay Thompson returned and Curry was injured just one game after Green came back.
Stephen Curry didn’t start but he did enter the game in the first quarter.
It was his first game action since suffering a sprain in his foot in a March 16 loss to the Boston Celtics.
The Warriors won 123-107.

     Summary: Steph Curry returns to the lineup as the Warriors pick up a 123-107 win over the Nuggets in Game 1.
During the first championship run of their dynastic era, their small lineup was so lethal it was dubbed the "death lineup."
And it was those five minutes that shifted the momentum to the Warriors going into halftime of their eventual 123-107 win on Saturday night.
In the three games he played against the Nuggets, Poole averaged 22.7 points, 58% shooting from the field and 61% shooting from the 3-point line.
The spacing Curry created was especially apparent playing in the Warriors' three-guard lineup with Poole and Thompson.

     Summary: Jordan Poole exploded for 30 points as the Golden State Warriors rolled to an easy 123-107 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Saturday in the opening contest of their Western Conference first-round series at San Francisco.
Stephen Curry added 16 points in 22 minutes off the bench after missing the previous 12 games with a left foot injury.
Curry’s timing was off as he finished 5-of-13 shooting in his first action since March 16.
Nikola Jokic registered 25 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for Denver.
Will Barton added 24 points for the Nuggets, who didn’t play like the squad that won three of four regular-season outings against the Warriors.
