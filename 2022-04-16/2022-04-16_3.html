     Josh Brolin Reflects On Almost Playing Batman &amp; Losing Out To Ben Affleck
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Brolin has revealed he almost was cast as Batman in Zack Snyder’s superhero films and shares his reaction to losing out to Ben Affleck, who portrayed the caped crusader in Snyder’s Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League follow-up.
Brolin said the idea “was interesting” to him, but as for Snyder’s eventual choice, “That was his decision, that wasn’t my decision.”“Honestly, that would have been a fun deal,” Brolin added.
He recently appeared at Deadline’s Contenders TV to talk about his role in Prime Video’s Outer Range supernatural Western series, which he also executive produces.
He’s also an executive producer on George and Tammy, an upcoming country music drama series co-produced by Spectrum Originals and Paramount Network.
Affleck is set to appear again as Batman in Warner Bros. upcoming The Flash.

That was interesting to me," said Brolin, before adding that it was Zack Snyder's decision to not move forward on his casting.

     Josh Brolin Almost Was Batman – Actor Regrets Losing the Role
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Brolin has surprised fans when he commented in an interview that he almost played Batman.
The actor would have played the character in Zack Snyder’s post-Justice League film version, which eventually settled on actor Ben Affleck.
Josh Brolin already has a place of honor in pop culture thanks to his role as Thanos in the last two Avengers installments.
Before the cancellation of the movie, the actor commented “That was his decision — that wasn’t my decision.
That was his decision.”As an amusing anecdote of the interview, Brolin commented about George Clooney’s version of Batman, in Batman and Robin from 1997.

     Josh Brolin almost played Batman in Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: ‘That would have been fun’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Brolin has been a part of two prominent comic book cinematic universes.
While the Avengers movies are part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Deadpool series was part of the now-defunct X-Men universe.
He was in contention for none other than Batman in Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which eventually went to Ben Affleck.
For the film, Snyder wanted a rustier, older and more ruthless Caped Crusader.
He will reprise the role, perhaps for the last time, in Ezra Miller-headlined The Flash, which releases next year.

     Josh Brolin Says He Almost Played Batman in the DCEU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On MTV’s Happy Sad Confused Podcast with Josh Horowitz, Dune and Avengers: Infinity War actor Josh Brolin revealed he was up for the role of Snyder’s Batman.
Brolin would finish the Batman conversation by saying, “It would have been the older, the more raspy, for lack of a better word.
There was a ton of fan art of Brolin as Batman at the time.
Image via Warner Bros.RELATED: Exclusive: Josh Brolin on 'Dune 2' and Denis Villeneuve's Oscars SnubBrolin would have made a great Batman, but then we would have not gotten Batflek or even Robert Pattinson in the role.
Also as Brolin joked about, we could see him end up being the iconic character when he is 80.

     Avengers: Age Of Ultron's Thanos Changes Surprised Josh Brolin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Josh Brolin revealed how much Avengers: Age of Ultron changed during post-production.
Brolin appeared next in Avengers: Age of Ultron where he finally made it clear that he's going after the Infinity Stones.
This effectively set up his role in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, the two movies that concluded the Infinity Saga in electrifying fashion.
It's no secret that the production for Avengers: Age of Ultron had some issues.
He may never be a prominent player again in the franchise, but an Avengers: Age of Ultron-type of cameo would be more than enough to excite viewers.
