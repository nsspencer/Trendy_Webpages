     Summary: A first-time performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is a dream come true for many people, and the experience still doesn't feel real for Southern California native DJ/producer VNSSA.
After high school, I started playing drums randomly and I met this girl playing guitar and we were like, 'let's start a band.'
We started playing shows here and there, but we never got really big or anything.
Then I started going to clubs, festivals and DJ shows and I was like, 'I can be the whole band myself.'
He's really nice, he's super supportive, he's an amazing DJ.
