    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His teammates stepped up that night to secure the Timberwolves a spot in the playoffs as the No.
During Game 1 against the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday afternoon, Towns seized that opportunity.
Knowing he wasn't going to win a one-on-one battle in that situation, Morant tried to sneak in for a steal as Towns caught the ball.
The result was an outrageous dunk that was one of the best plays of Towns' career, and the early leader for the best moment of the postseason.
The Timberwolves need him to play with that kind of aggressive mindset if they want to pull off an upset against the Grizzlies.
