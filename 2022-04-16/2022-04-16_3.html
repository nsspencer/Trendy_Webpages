MUST WATCH:Toronto Raptors at Philadelphia 76ersErick W. Rasco/Sports IllustratedI’m convinced the Sixers haven’t played a drama-free playoff series since they got back to the playoffs in 2017–18 after years of tanking.
They were dealt some early luck with Luka Dončić’s calf strain, but this series opener in Dallas should still be a great way to get the NBA playoffs started.
ET, FS1, watch on fuboTV• Denver Nuggets at Golden State Warriors | This series has a ton of story lines.
But, I’ll have my eyes on Klay Thompson, who will be playing his first playoff game since injuring his knee in the 2019 NBA Finals.
