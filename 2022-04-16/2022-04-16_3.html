     Warriors news: Stephen Curry to come off the bench in Game 1 return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors and their fans are happy to welcome Stephen Curry back to the floor for Game 1 of the Dubs first-round playoff matchup against the Denver Nuggets.
Curry, though, will be in an unfamiliar role, coming off the bench in his first game back.
After missing the past month since he suffered a sprained ligament in his foot, Curry’s return will coencide with the franchise’s first playoff game at the Chase Center.
Given his prolonged absence, the Warriors will likely have a strict minutes limit on Curry as he tries to reacclimate to NBA action.
Curry averaged 25.5 points, 5.2 rebounds, 6.3 assists, and 1.3 steals per game on .437/.380/.923 shooting in 64 games this season.

     Golden State Warriors' Steph Curry will play in Game 1 of playoff series against Denver Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors’ playoff campaign will begin with star Steph Curry in the lineup.
This announcement came from head coach Steve Kerr, who spoke to reporters prior to the team’s Game 1 matchup against the Denver Nuggets for their opening round playoff series.
Curry had been dealing with a foot injury that kept him out for the final 12 games of the regular season.
It’s no secret that the Warriors are objectively worse off without Curry on the team.
His presence requires entire defensive game plans to revolve around where he is on the court at all times.

     Recap: Nuggets drowned by Jordan Poole and the Golden State Warriors 123-107
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For about a quarter and a half of tonight’s game it looked like the Denver Nuggets would go toe-to-toe with the Golden State Warriors.
Then, in a span of just under four minutes, Golden State went on an 18-4 explosion.
Led by Jordan Poole in his playoff debut, Golden State’s new “death” lineup of Poole-Steph Curry-Klay Thompson-Andrew Wiggins-Draymond Green took it to Denver in that span.
Poole scored 14 of his 17 first half points in the second quarter and was nearly perfect from the field.
The Nuggets tried to chip away in the third quarter to no avail, and the fourth quarter was all garbage time.
