     Is the Luka Doncic injury really a good thing for the Jazz?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic is reportedly going to miss Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs against the Utah Jazz, and he could miss more.
Of course, nobody ever wishes injury on a player, but this could be a really lucky break for the Jazz?
But this injury adds a ton of pressure to this Jazz team and everyone surrounding it.
If the Jazz were to go down swinging in seven games to a Doncic-led Dallas team, that would be pretty understandable.
