The singer brought country superstar Shania Twain to the stage for an unannounced set in the middle of his own performance, delivering two of her biggest classic hit songs.
“In the car with my mother as a child, this lady taught me to sing,” Styles told the audience, joking, “She also taught me that men are trash.”“I’m kind of lost for words," Twain responded.
