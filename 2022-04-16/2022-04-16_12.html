     Summary: It's hard to remember an NBA playoff landscape as wide-open as this one, which means making predictions is even more difficult than usual.
The 64-win Phoenix Suns are the favorite to come out of the Western Conference, but there are several teams like the blue-blood Golden State Warriors and upstart Memphis Grizzlies ready to ruin their journey.
And then there's the Brooklyn Nets, once the favorite to win the title, with one of the most proficient offensive duos in the NBA in Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
Despite the uncertainty, our CBS Sports NBA experts have predicted every series of the playoffs, including the eventual champion.

Several of these series have the potential to go the full seven games, while a couple others may be four-game sweeps.
With so much action to focus on, we've ranked the first-round matchups from least exciting to most.
This series really had the potential to be exciting, but the calf strain of Luka Doncic has really dampened that.
Oh and then there's the potential for Ben Simmons to make his long-awaited season debut.
