And it darned sure showed in his first play-in game.
Edwards scored 36 points to lead the Timberwolves to a 130-117 win over the Grizzlies in Game 1 of their first-round series Saturday.
Here are the most points scored in playoff debuts:In a welcome upturn from his first playoff series a few years ago and worse play-in game a few days ago, Karl-Anthony Towns had 29 points and 13 rebounds.
Far weirder scene: To one up the protester who tried to glue herself to the floor in Minnesota’s play-in game, another protester chained herself to the basket in Memphis today:

     Summary: articleFor the second straight game, a protester caused a disruption at a Minnesota Timberwolves game.
She was wearing a "Glen Taylor Roasts Animals Alive" shirt.
The incident was in protest of a mass killing of chickens at Rembrandt Enterprises, a factory egg farm in Iowa owned by Taylor.
The animal rights activist group protesting Taylor says Rembrandt Enterprises has let go 200 employees since the chickens died.
A different protester wearing the same shirt held her own event Saturday as the Timberwolves are in Memphis facing the Grizzlies for Game 1 of their playoff series.

     Timberwolves vs. Grizzlies: Karl-Anthony Towns throws down outrageous dunk on Jaren Jackson Jr.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His teammates stepped up that night to secure the Timberwolves a spot in the playoffs as the No.
During Game 1 against the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday afternoon, Towns seized that opportunity.
Knowing he wasn't going to win a one-on-one battle in that situation, Morant tried to sneak in for a steal as Towns caught the ball.
The result was an outrageous dunk that was one of the best plays of Towns' career, and the early leader for the best moment of the postseason.
The Timberwolves need him to play with that kind of aggressive mindset if they want to pull off an upset against the Grizzlies.
