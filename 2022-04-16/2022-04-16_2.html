     Liverpool Missing Five Players For FA Cup Semi-Final Against Manchester City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool face Manchester City today in the FA Cup semi-final as they look to keep their quadruple push alive.
Unfortunately, The Reds will be missing five players from their squad due to different ruling for FA AND UEFA.
Following last week’s draw in the Premier League to Manchester City, The Reds remain one behind their title rivals.
Pep Guardiola received bad news about the injuries to Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker, both being ruled out of the cup semi-final.
Due to a different ruling between FA and UEFA, both sides will only be able to have seven substitutes instead of the twelve they would get in the Champions League.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just as Manchester City and Liverpool recover from their breathless classic at the Etihad last Sunday, the two sides are again set to slog it out the semi-finals of the FA Cup.
The stakes continue to rise for both sides with Manchester City chasing the treble, while Liverpool are chasing an unprecedented quadruple.
In fact, while both De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva created two chances each throughout the game, Liverpool's trio provided none between them.
Given how Liverpool's midfield played last week, the Guinean international might be worth a shout of a start in the crunch FA Cup clash.
Stats in terms of passes, duels and ball recoveries also favour Manchester City's defenders over Liverpool's back four last weekend.
