     Chelsea v Crystal Palace: FA Cup semi-final match preview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Patrick Vieira has stage managed several dramatic upsets this season, beating Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals would top the lot.
Crystal Palace have lost their past nine games in succession against the west London club, with their last win coming in 2017 and giving Roy Hodgson his first victory as Palace manager.
Wilfried Zaha scored the winner that day and, according to Jack Butland, Selhurst Park’s favourite son “will be up for it” at Wembley.
Conor Gallagher, on loan from Chelsea, will not be able to play against his parent club, while Thomas Tuchel will be without Callum Hudson-Odoi but could welcome back Romelu Lukaku.

     Liverpool Missing Five Players For FA Cup Semi-Final Against Manchester City
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool face Manchester City today in the FA Cup semi-final as they look to keep their quadruple push alive.
Unfortunately, The Reds will be missing five players from their squad due to different ruling for FA AND UEFA.
Following last week’s draw in the Premier League to Manchester City, The Reds remain one behind their title rivals.
Pep Guardiola received bad news about the injuries to Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker, both being ruled out of the cup semi-final.
Due to a different ruling between FA and UEFA, both sides will only be able to have seven substitutes instead of the twelve they would get in the Champions League.

     Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi is 'looking forward' to FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi has revealed he is 'looking forward' to his side's FA Cup semi-final clash against Chelsea on Sunday.
The Eagles man joined the Premier League side in the summer transfer window, moving from West to South London.
He has already played twice against his former club this season, and he was on the losing side in both meetings against Chelsea.
From confidence wise I think it is a huge boost but still it is a disappointment to go out of Champions League at quarter-final.
In a knockout game at Bernabeu this was a fantastic performance and stays like this but still tastes bitter because we are out of Champions League.

     Summary: 🏆 pic.twitter.com/d7yBD2YyT4 — Emirates FA Cup (@EmiratesFACup) April 14, 2022Aiming to reach their 15th FA Cup final, the Cityzens come into this one off the back of a hard fought Champions League tie on Wednesday.
Having lost in this very round in each of the last two seasons, the Cityzens will hope for a second FA Cup title in the last four.
The Merseyside-based club have reached the FA Cup final on 14 occasions, but not since 2012.
Having won the cup the most out of the remaining teams, the Blues will have a chance at a fourth FA Cup final appearance in five seasons and their third straight.
With this weekend’s matchups both looking quite promising regarding excitement, the thrill of the FA Cup will take centre stage.

The two English sides have bigger fish to fry in other competitions, but that will not stop Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp from doing all they can to reach the FA Cup final.
Neither side has any major injury concerns to worry about, so they should both field strong starting line-ups in this mouthwatering tie.

Liverpool are not believed to have any new injury concerns, but Jurgen Klopp will have to manage his squad carefully after the exertions required against Manchester City and Benfica.
