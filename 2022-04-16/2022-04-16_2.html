     Man City apologise to Liverpool as fans boo Hillsborough silence before FA Cup semifinal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Man City, Liverpool hold moment's silence before FA Cup semifinal in honour of victims of Hillsborough tragedy.
Justin Setterfield - The FA/The FA via Getty ImagesManchester City have apologised to Liverpool after a section of their supporters interrupted a period of silence to mark the Hillsborough tragedy before the FA Cup semifinal Saturday at Wembley.
A pocket of City fans could be heard chanting after referee Michael Oliver blew his whistle to signal a moment's reflection in memory of the 97 Liverpool supporters who died at a 1989 FA Cup semifinal against Nottingham Forest.
The noise triggered an angry reaction from the Liverpool end as boos rang out in response, and a City spokesperson said: "Manchester City are extremely disappointed with the actions of some City supporters during the minute's silence before today's game.
Liverpool won the match 3-2 to reach their first FA Cup final since 2012, while City last won the competition in 2019.

     Liverpool-Manchester City: Jurgen Klopp’s side dominates in FA Cup semifinal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the Brazilian’s shot was deflected over the bar by Virgil van Dijk and Liverpool’s 3–2 lead in the FA Cup semifinal was preserved.
After last week’s 2–2 draw in the league, City still holds a one-point lead in the Premier League title race, while if both win their semifinals, they will meet for a fourth time this season in the Champions League final.
Liverpool has already won the League Cup and becomes only the 11th side ever to reach both domestic Cup finals in the same season.
“Manchester City are extremely disappointed with the actions of some City supporters during the minute’s silence before today’s game,” a club statement read.
But the real finale could come in the Champions League final in Paris next month.

     Summary: History repeated itself on Saturday afternoon, as a rotated Manchester City side fell to a rather expected defeat in the FA Cup Semi-final for the third season in a row, this time at the hands of Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool.
There can't have been a single Manchester City fan on this floating space-rock who didn't at least wonder why nobody came off the bench until the 80th minute.
Flashes of quality aren't enough IMAGO / Uk Sports Pics Ltd Obviously, it just wouldn't be fair to suggest that Manchester City were completely played off the park against Liverpool.
One-on-ones are certainly an area where almost the whole team could improve, with Kevin de Bruyne currently just about the only Manchester City player you'd expect to put one away.
