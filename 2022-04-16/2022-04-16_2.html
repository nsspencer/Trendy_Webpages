     Summary: When Lauri Markannen signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers during the offseason, the chances of him finally making the NBA Playoffs didn’t look particularly good.
8 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs and putting the Cavs into offseason mode.
Markannen would have been the sixth former Arizona player on a roster for the 2022 NBA Playoffs and the only one competing in the East.
The Suns opted not to offer Ayton a max extension before the season, making him a restricted free agent after the playoffs.
Iggy’s 170 career playoff games played in ranks 24th in NBA history, and depending on how far the Warriors go he could get to as high as 11th on that list this spring.
