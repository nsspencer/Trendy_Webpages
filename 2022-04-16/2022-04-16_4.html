     Tom Hanks &amp; 'Castaway' Co-Star Wilson Throw the First Pitch at Guardians Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Hanks is getting some very unhelpful assistance.
The 65-year-old Castaway star was joined by his “co-star,” the volleyball named Wilson from the movie, while throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at the home opener for the Cleveland Guardians on Friday (April 15).
Wilson had the Cleveland Guardians’ logo featured.
However, as Tom wound up to throw the pitch, Wilson rolled down the mound.
Eventually, he ignored the volleyball and threw the first pitch to Larry Doby Jr. as the crowd cheered.

     Summary: More infoTom Hanks, 65, is known for his role in many films but his undeniably amazing performance in 2000's Castaway will never be forgotten.
The Hollywood actor took to Cleveland Guardian's pitch with the iconic volleyball Wilson, his bloody-faced co-star in Castaway.
Tom was announced to the home crowd at Progressive Field, and the star brought his very famous co-star to the pitch.
