     Mavericks Make Decision On Luka Doncic: Fans React
    </h2>

     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks have made an official decision on their injured superstar Luka Doncic.
Just a few hours before tipoff on Saturday, the Mavs PR Twitter revealed that Doncic will not be able to suit up for this afternoon’s Game 1 matchup against the Utah Jazz.
Luka Dončić (left calf strain) is out for Game 1 against the Jazz.

     Luka Doncic (calf strain) misses Game 1 loss to Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic was sidelined for the Dallas Mavericks’ 99-93 Game 1 loss to the Utah Jazz in their playoff series on Saturday because of the left calf strain the All-Star guard suffered in the regular-season finale.
Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said before the opener of the best-of-seven series that Doncic is day to day.
Doncic finished the regular season as the NBA’s third-leading scorer at 28.4 points per game.
He wouldn’t have been able to play in that finale against the Spurs if the NBA hasn’t rescinded the 16th technical foul that Doncic got in the second-to-last regular-season game April 8.
“We prepared for Luka for this whole series,” Jazz guard Mike Conley said.

     Luka Doncic injury update: Mavericks concerned star could miss Game 2 vs. Jazz due to calf strain, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Mavericks star point guard Luka Doncic missed Game 1 of the team's first-round playoff series against the Utah Jazz on Saturday.
His absence was expected after the Mavericks announced Tuesday that Doncic was diagnosed with a left calf strain after undergoing an MRI earlier this week.
There's "significant concern" that Doncic could also miss Game 2 in this series as well, according to ESPN.
"The Mavericks are very much preparing for the possibility of not only maybe not having [Doncic] in Game 1, but maybe even Game 2 on Monday.
With Doncic missing Game 1, Dallas will turn to Spencer Dinwiddie and Jalen Brunson to try and fill the All-NBA guard's shoes.
