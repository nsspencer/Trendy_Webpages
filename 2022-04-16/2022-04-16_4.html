     Golden State Warriors host Denver Nuggets in Game 1 of their first round NBA playoff game.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors are back in the playoffs for the first time since the 2019 NBA Finals.
Squaring off against the Denver Nuggest and the reigning MVP Nikola Jokic at Chase Center Saturday night, the Golden State Warriors finally played their first game with their full complement of rotation players all season long, after Draymond Green went down just as Klay Thompson returned and Curry was injured just one game after Green came back.
Stephen Curry didn’t start but he did enter the game in the first quarter.
It was his first game action since suffering a sprain in his foot in a March 16 loss to the Boston Celtics.
The Warriors won 123-107.

     Scott Foster shows alleged bias against Golden State Warriors is over, ejects Nuggets' DeMarcus Cousins in Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesFor years, there was concern that NBA referee Scott Foster had it out for the Golden State Warriors.
But perhaps some of that was put to rest with one of the decisions his officiating crew made in the final frame of Saturday’s first-round playoff game against the Denver Nuggets.
Less than a couple of minutes into the fourth quarter of Game 1, officials ejected backup Denver center DeMarcus Cousins for yelling at one of them.
As Cousins continued to protest the decision, Foster turned around and gave him a second consecutive technical foul, leading to his immediate ejection.

     Stephen Curry Returns, and Golden State Is Getting Playoff Wins Again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Jordan Poole, wow, what a playoff debut,” Thompson raved to reporters after the game, adding: “We should be very grateful for Jordan’s development and the type of player he’s become because he’s just incredible.
Saturday against Denver was only the third playoff game of Curry’s career in which he played but didn’t start.
Almost immediately, Curry made his presence felt, finding Thompson for an open 3-pointer from the corner and sneaking a pass between two defenders to an open Green for a dunk.
But his presence alone still drew outsize attention from the Nuggets, and the Warriors outscored Denver by 17 points with Curry on the floor.
“It was nice to feel the playoff vibe again, and obviously it is different coming off the bench and trying to make the most of the minutes that are appropriate right now,” Curry said.

     Golden State Warriors give 'scary' glimpse at new 'death lineup' in Game 1 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steph Curry returns to the lineup as the Warriors pick up a 123-107 win over the Nuggets in Game 1.
During the first championship run of their dynastic era, their small lineup was so lethal it was dubbed the "death lineup."
And it was those five minutes that shifted the momentum to the Warriors going into halftime of their eventual 123-107 win on Saturday night.
In the three games he played against the Nuggets, Poole averaged 22.7 points, 58% shooting from the field and 61% shooting from the 3-point line.
The spacing Curry created was especially apparent playing in the Warriors' three-guard lineup with Poole and Thompson.

     Warriors vs. Nuggets: Golden State's unique, successful blend of old and new on full display in Game 1 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO -- After yet another trademark Golden State Warriors third-quarter run, Stephen Curry walked toward the stands, gesticulating desperately for the home fans to get louder.
"It was almost because the lead was so big, you lose the anxiousness of the moment, and that's where you remind yourself like, this is a playoff game.
"The tree is becoming part of another tree," Yang says.
The quintet has more titles than an 18th-century British noble, and all of their skills and quirks were on display in the Game 1 win.
The only thing on the Warriors' minds is Monday's Game 2 against Denver.
