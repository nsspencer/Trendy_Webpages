     These 3 Golden State Warriors are why the Dubs will defeat the Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been a hectic season for the Golden State Warriors.
It was a year that was filled with ups and downs for the Warriors.
The Warriors will start their first-round battle with the Denver Nuggets on Saturday, and if these 3 players step up, the Dubs should come out on top.
Upon getting Thompson back after the new calendar year rang, the Dubs saw four-time All-Star forward Draymond Green suffer a back injury.
Nonetheless, the playoffs are the Warriors for the taking, and if these three players step up to the plate, they’ll be just fine in the long run.

     Golden State Warriors' Steph Curry will play in Game 1 of playoff series against Denver Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors’ playoff campaign will begin with star Steph Curry in the lineup.
This announcement came from head coach Steve Kerr, who spoke to reporters prior to the team’s Game 1 matchup against the Denver Nuggets for their opening round playoff series.
Curry had been dealing with a foot injury that kept him out for the final 12 games of the regular season.
It’s no secret that the Warriors are objectively worse off without Curry on the team.
His presence requires entire defensive game plans to revolve around where he is on the court at all times.
