     Stephen Curry Returns, and Golden State Is Getting Playoff Wins Again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Stephen Curry drew several defenders any time he touched the ball.
The threesome who redefined basketball en route to winning a series of championships with the Golden State Warriors reunited in the playoffs on Saturday for the first time since 2019.
In a surprise move, Curry began the game on the bench.
In his place, Coach Steve Kerr started the third-year guard Jordan Poole, who is having a career year.
Poole was exceptional in his first career playoff game, scoring 30 points — a game high — on 9 for 13 shooting, electrifying the Chase Center crowd in San Francisco.

     Golden State Warriors host Denver Nuggets in Game 1 of their first round NBA playoff game.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors are back in the playoffs for the first time since the 2019 NBA Finals.
Squaring off against the Denver Nuggest and the reigning MVP Nikola Jokic at Chase Center Saturday night, the Golden State Warriors finally played their first game with their full complement of rotation players all season long, after Draymond Green went down just as Klay Thompson returned and Curry was injured just one game after Green came back.
Stephen Curry didn’t start but he did enter the game in the first quarter.
It was his first game action since suffering a sprain in his foot in a March 16 loss to the Boston Celtics.
The Warriors won 123-107.

     Warriors news: Stephen Curry to come off the bench in Game 1 return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors and their fans are happy to welcome Stephen Curry back to the floor for Game 1 of the Dubs first-round playoff matchup against the Denver Nuggets.
Curry, though, will be in an unfamiliar role, coming off the bench in his first game back.
After missing the past month since he suffered a sprained ligament in his foot, Curry’s return will coencide with the franchise’s first playoff game at the Chase Center.
Given his prolonged absence, the Warriors will likely have a strict minutes limit on Curry as he tries to reacclimate to NBA action.
Curry averaged 25.5 points, 5.2 rebounds, 6.3 assists, and 1.3 steals per game on .437/.380/.923 shooting in 64 games this season.

     Scott Foster shows alleged bias against Golden State Warriors is over, ejects Nuggets' DeMarcus Cousins in Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesFor years, there was concern that NBA referee Scott Foster had it out for the Golden State Warriors.
But perhaps some of that was put to rest with one of the decisions his officiating crew made in the final frame of Saturday’s first-round playoff game against the Denver Nuggets.
Less than a couple of minutes into the fourth quarter of Game 1, officials ejected backup Denver center DeMarcus Cousins for yelling at one of them.
As Cousins continued to protest the decision, Foster turned around and gave him a second consecutive technical foul, leading to his immediate ejection.

     Recap: Nuggets drowned by Jordan Poole and the Golden State Warriors 123-107
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For about a quarter and a half of tonight’s game it looked like the Denver Nuggets would go toe-to-toe with the Golden State Warriors.
Then, in a span of just under four minutes, Golden State went on an 18-4 explosion.
Led by Jordan Poole in his playoff debut, Golden State’s new “death” lineup of Poole-Steph Curry-Klay Thompson-Andrew Wiggins-Draymond Green took it to Denver in that span.
Poole scored 14 of his 17 first half points in the second quarter and was nearly perfect from the field.
The Nuggets tried to chip away in the third quarter to no avail, and the fourth quarter was all garbage time.
