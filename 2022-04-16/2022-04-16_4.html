     Uneven Jazz top Luka Doncic-less Mavericks in Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Really, the Mavericks – with tight defense against the NBA’s best regular-season offense – showed impressive resolve given the circumstances.
Up 11 with fewer than six minutes left, Utah – which has developed a troubling habit of blowing leads – let Dallas get within one.
Without Doncic, Dallas ran its offense through Jalen Brunson (24 points and five assists) and Spencer Dinwiddie (22 points and eight assists).
Staying big when Dallas went smaller, the Jazz ignored Jalen Green, who might not have cracked the playoff rotation if Doncic were healthy.
Green (0-for-4 on 3-pointers, zero points in 10 minutes) did not make Utah pay.

     Mavericks Make Decision On Luka Doncic: Fans React
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks have made an official decision on their injured superstar Luka Doncic.
Just a few hours before tipoff on Saturday, the Mavs PR Twitter revealed that Doncic will not be able to suit up for this afternoon’s Game 1 matchup against the Utah Jazz.
Luka Dončić (left calf strain) is out for Game 1 against the Jazz.
— Mavs PR (@MavsPR) April 16, 2022This is tough news to swallow for NBA fans who were looking forward to seeing one of the best players in the game in postseason action.
Doncic suffered his calf strain injury during the Mavericks’ final game of the regular season — despite having already clinched the No.

     Luka Doncic (calf strain) misses Game 1 loss to Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic was sidelined for the Dallas Mavericks’ 99-93 Game 1 loss to the Utah Jazz in their playoff series on Saturday because of the left calf strain the All-Star guard suffered in the regular-season finale.
Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said before the opener of the best-of-seven series that Doncic is day to day.
Doncic finished the regular season as the NBA’s third-leading scorer at 28.4 points per game.
He wouldn’t have been able to play in that finale against the Spurs if the NBA hasn’t rescinded the 16th technical foul that Doncic got in the second-to-last regular-season game April 8.
“We prepared for Luka for this whole series,” Jazz guard Mike Conley said.

     Mavericks vs. Jazz Game 1: Dallas can't replicate Luka Doncic, redemption for Rudy Gobert among key takeaways
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Give the Dallas Mavericks credit.
Once it became clear that they would be playing Game 1 of their first-round series against the Utah Jazz without Luka Doncic, they easily could've folded.
So as the Mavericks try to regroup for Game 2, let's take a look back at Game 1.
But the Mavericks have grown extremely dependent on Doncic in recent years, and that was on full display in this game.
Nobody is going to give Gobert credit for locking down the Mavericks without Doncic.
