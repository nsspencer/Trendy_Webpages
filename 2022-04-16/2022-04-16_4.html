     Mavericks Make Decision On Luka Doncic: Fans React
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks have made an official decision on their injured superstar Luka Doncic.
Just a few hours before tipoff on Saturday, the Mavs PR Twitter revealed that Doncic will not be able to suit up for this afternoon’s Game 1 matchup against the Utah Jazz.
Luka Dončić (left calf strain) is out for Game 1 against the Jazz.
— Mavs PR (@MavsPR) April 16, 2022This is tough news to swallow for NBA fans who were looking forward to seeing one of the best players in the game in postseason action.
Doncic suffered his calf strain injury during the Mavericks’ final game of the regular season — despite having already clinched the No.

     Luka Doncic (calf strain) misses Game 1 loss to Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic was sidelined for the Dallas Mavericks’ 99-93 Game 1 loss to the Utah Jazz in their playoff series on Saturday because of the left calf strain the All-Star guard suffered in the regular-season finale.
Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said before the opener of the best-of-seven series that Doncic is day to day.
Doncic finished the regular season as the NBA’s third-leading scorer at 28.4 points per game.
He wouldn’t have been able to play in that finale against the Spurs if the NBA hasn’t rescinded the 16th technical foul that Doncic got in the second-to-last regular-season game April 8.
“We prepared for Luka for this whole series,” Jazz guard Mike Conley said.

     Is the Luka Doncic injury really a good thing for the Jazz?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic is reportedly going to miss Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs against the Utah Jazz, and he could miss more.
Of course, nobody ever wishes injury on a player, but this could be a really lucky break for the Jazz?
But this injury adds a ton of pressure to this Jazz team and everyone surrounding it.
If the Jazz were to go down swinging in seven games to a Doncic-led Dallas team, that would be pretty understandable.
