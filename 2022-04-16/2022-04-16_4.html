     Summary: 6 of 8Brian Babineau/Getty ImagesSeries Line: Celtics -130The Brooklyn Nets aren't your typical seventh seed.
Getting Simmons back, even if it's on a minutes restriction, will aid the Brooklyn defense and playmaking as well.
However, this Celtics team has posted the best net rating (plus-8.4) of any NBA team dating back to Halloween and finished as the No.
Even with Durant and Irving on the court together this year, Brooklyn is a modest 11-6.
The Nets have the star power to make this a long series and are one of the best No.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Quinn will make at least one pick for every game between now and the NBA Finals.
Game 1 will be just his second game since late March, and Patrick Beverley isn't going to let him ease his way back onto the court.
The Grizzlies should win this series, but the Timberwolves have a chance to steal what should be a competitive Game 1.
If you assume both teams will split the scoring burden equally, they'd need to score 112 points apiece to get to this line.
