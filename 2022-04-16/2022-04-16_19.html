    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Belal Muhammad silenced any doubt that he is one of the best welterweights in the world on Saturday night as he proved a puzzle too difficult for Vicente Luque to solve in the main event of UFC Fight Night.
Muhammad was entirely in control of the fight excluding a third round in which he was repeatedly stumbled by Luque.
Muhammad utilized whipping body kicks to score points from a distance and landed takedowns once Luque was caught up with striking exchanges.
Muhammad landed takedowns in each of the first four rounds, including a third-round in which he was rocked meaningfully by Luque.
He criticized "Chaos" for taking fights against Jorge Masvidal and Tyron Woodley, both of whom entered the Covington fights on consecutive losses, and challenging lightweights like Dustin Poirier.
