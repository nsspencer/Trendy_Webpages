Ms. Rieger co-anchored that broadcast for more than 20 years.
The episode led Ms. Rieger to launch a weekly segment and accompanying blog called Going Green.
On the air, Ms. Rieger was inclined to show a personally revealing, self-deprecating side when the mood felt right.
As a flaxen-haired former actress, Ms. Rieger often appeared on lists of Washington’s most attractive local celebrities.
