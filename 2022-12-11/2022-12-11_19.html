     Bucs vs. 49ers: Top storylines for Tampa Bay in Week 14
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Growing up in the other Bay Area, Bucs quarterback Tom Brady was a die-hard 49ers fan, frequently attending games with his family.
There were so many great players, it was a great era of football and I loved the 49ers,” Brady said Thursday, recounting the days of Joe Montana, Steve Young and Jerry Rice.
Sunday, Brady returns to San Francisco to play for just the second time in his legendary 23-year career.
“I loved them through college, and then when they skipped over me six times, I started hating the 49ers, and that’s just the way it went down,” Brady continued, referencing his draft-day fall to the sixth round in 2000.
As if he ever needed any extra motivation, this is one Brady will want badly.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The rookie QB led the San Francisco 49ers to a blowout win over Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Purdy had 185 yards and two passing touchdowns, and a rushing touchdown in the first start of his NFL career.
On Sunday Purdy came in as the starter in just his second game ever, and looked like a poised veteran leading the offense.
Right before the end of the half, Purdy connected with Brandon Aiyuk on a 32 yard TD to put the game out of reach going into the second half.
There is no prognosis yet, but the initial reports out of San Francisco indicate it is not a serious injury.
