     Tee Higgins limited by hamstring injury during Cincinnati's Week 15 game vs. Cleveland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cincinnati Bengals receiver Tee Higgins was limited during Sunday's Week 15 win against the Cleveland Browns because of a hamstring injury he aggravated.
Bengals head coach Zac Taylor told reporters after the game that Higgins tweaked his injury during pregame warm-ups, adding that Higgins wanted to play through it.
Higgins' teammate, Tyler Boyd, dislocated his finger on quarterback Joe Burrow's first pass of the game.
The Bengals announced Boyd's return was questionable, and later downgraded Boyd to out for the rest of the game.
Higgins entered Sunday's game with 60 receptions for 861 yards and five touchdowns this season, his third with the Bengals.

     Zac Taylor drops stunning Tee Higgins injury revelation after win vs. Browns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Dan Fappiano · 2 min readWhile the Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Cleveland Browns in Week 14, wide receiver Tee Higgins managed to play just one snap.
Speaking after the win, Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said that Cincinnati didn’t want Higgins on the field at all.
Taylor added that the Bengals had some goal-line packages for Higgins if necessary, but in defeating the Browns 23-10, that plan didn’t come to fruition.
When healthy, Higgins has been a crucial part of the Bengals’ offense.
Whether he walked onto the field himself or the coaching staff put him in, Tee Higgins didn’t appear ready to play.

     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Cleveland Browns on Sunday for their 5th win in a row, and Joe Burrow’s first career win over their division rival.

On the Bengals’ opening possession, Tyler Boyd injured his finger on a pass intended for him and immediately went to the locker room.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI, Ohio — Bengals coach Zac Taylor came up with a list of situations he might consider using Tee Higgins in a 23-10 win over the Browns after the receiver injured his hamstring during pregame warmups.
Higgins somehow managed to sneak past Taylor and get on the field for the play that turned out to be his only snap of the game.
He lined up off the right side of the line against Browns rookie corner Martin Emerson and ran a route downfield.
While Higgins wasn’t on the move for very long, Taylor sounded relieved that the ball didn’t end up going Higgins’ way.
“I was hoping that the game would go in our favor to where he would not be used,” Taylor said.

     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals lost two of their three top wideouts in the span of moments during Sunday’s win over the Cleveland Browns.
Slot wideout Tyler Boyd suffered what looked like a hand injury during an incompletion on the game’s first drive.
After the 23-10 win, Bengals head coach Zac Taylor revealed that Boyd disloacted his finger, hence his never returning to the game, per Geoff Hobson of Bengals.com.
Higgins tweaked his hamstring during warmups and coaches made the call to pull him out of precaution despite his wanting to play.
He had popped up briefly this past week on the injury report with what can be presumed as the same hamstring issue.

     Summary: Bengals WR Tyler Boyd is ruled out for remainder of the game after a finger injury on the second play of the game.
(0:16)CINCINNATI -- Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins' only snap Sunday against the Cleveland Browns was an unplanned one, according to coach Zac Taylor.
Higgins' cameo appearance came after Bengals wide receiver Tyler Boyd suffered a dislocated finger on his right hand.
With Higgins and Boyd out, Cincinnati relied on Ja'Marr Chase, Trent Taylor and Trenton Irwin as its primary receivers.
"It was a constant conversation for four quarters for how that affects the game plan," Taylor said of losing Boyd and Higgins.

     Summary: The Bengals, who were 6-point favorites most of the week, were suddenly just 4-point favorites at BetMGM on Sunday morning.
Maybe it's just a coincidence that Bengals receiver Tee Higgins played one snap on Sunday with a hamstring injury.
It was horrible for fantasy players who had Higgins and needed to win in Week 14 to make the playoffs.
Bengals coach Zac Taylor said Higgins, who has 861 yards this season and is one of the NFL's best receivers, was injured in warmups.
