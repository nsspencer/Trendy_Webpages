     Rapid Reactions: Panthers earn first road win of season, 30-24 in Seattle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SEATTLE — The Panthers have done some good things in the last two months, but interim coach Steve Wilks has continued to insist they had to finish.
Coupled with the Buccaneers' loss at San Francisco, the Panthers are just a game out of first place in the NFC South.
They also did it with a bludgeoning run game as they continued to build on a physical identity.
But the Panthers didn't fold, playing sharply in the second half when they needed it the most.
— Long snapper JJ Jansen broke the franchise's all-time games played record, appearing in his 222nd career game.
