     Shams: Nets interested in John Collins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the unofficial opening of trade season Thursday, the rumors have begun to fly and Shams Charania reports that the Nets have interest in John Collins, the Hawks 6’10” big man.
Shams report follows a similar report from Ian Begley of SNY who last week wrote that the Nets had “touched base” with the Hawks on Collins.
Collins signed his five-year, $125 million contract with the Hawks in July 2022, all of it guaranteed.
He is owed $23.5 million this season, $25.3 million in 2023-24, $26.6 million in 2024-25 and has a player option for the same amount in 2025-26.
Harris, on the other hand, is making $18.6 million this season and $19.9 million in 2023-24, permitting a one-for-one deal under CBA rules.

     Nets roll past Wizards to fourth straight NBA victory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn's Kevin Durant and Yuta Watanabe high five in the first half of the Nets' 112-100 NBA victory over the Washington WizardsLos Angeles (AFP) – The Brooklyn Nets cruised to their fourth straight NBA victory on Monday as Kevin Durant's 30 points fueled a 112-100 win over the Wizards in Washington.
Durant said the Nets' recent strong run owed something to seven straight games at home, and also to the fact that a few opponents were shorthanded.
On Monday, the Nets led by double digits for much of the second half, holding the Wizards to 45 points after the interval.
Durant added nine rebounds and six assists and Irving added 24 points as the Nets dealt the Wizards a seventh straight defeat.
Butler scored seven straight points in the burst and Miami held on for the win.

Will Barton led the Wizards with 22 points off the bench in a surprising rejuvenation after a struggle-filled start to the season.

     Nets interested in Hawks’ John Collins: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Nets have entered the John Collins sweepstakes — but the Atlanta Hawks reportedly aren’t interested in what the Nets are selling.
The Hawks have been floating the star forward’s name in trade rumors for years, and according to The Athletic, the Nets are among teams interested in acquiring Collins’ services.
The Hawks, according to The Athletic, however, weren’t interested in a deal that includes sharpshooter Joe Harris.
SNY’s Ian Begley also reported the Nets “touched base” with the Hawks about Collins’ availability last week.
The Nets are clearly interested in making a deal, but it remains unclear whether or not the Hawks will entertain a trade seriously given Brooklyn’s roster constraints.

     Why Nets must not include Joe Harris in John Collins trade with Hawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shams Charania mentioned the Nets as one of four teams in contact with the Atlanta Hawks surrounding forward John Collins.
“Atlanta has not shown interest so far in a potential framework that would contain Brooklyn’s Joe Harris,” Charania said, citing unnamed sources.
Harris is widely viewed as the Nets’ top trade chip due to his $18.6 million salary and high-level shooting.
A Harris-Collins swap would significantly limit Brooklyn’s shooting surrounding Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
Replacing Harris with Collins, who struggles to defend in space, would further limit Brooklyn’s already abysmal point-of-attack defense moving forward.
