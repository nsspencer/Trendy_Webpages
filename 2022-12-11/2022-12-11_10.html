     Lions vs. Vikings score: Jared Goff torches Minnesota to claim fifth win in six games, remain in playoff race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Entering Sunday's matchup with the Lions owning a five-game advantage in the win column, Minnesota had no answer for its rival on the defensive side of the ball.
Surrendering three touchdown passes to a red-hot Jared Goff, Kevin O'Connell's squad fell 34-23, giving Detroit its fifth win in six games, not to mention added momentum in the NFC playoff race.
Kirk Cousins played a part in that as well, rifling a number of pinpoint throws down the stretch.
But the Lions also disrupted Minnesota's offense up front, with Aidan Hutchinson headlining a persistent pass rush that got to Cousins four different times.
Now 6-7, Detroit prevented the Vikings from clinching the NFC North with the win, while keeping itself in the wild card race behind teams like the Commanders, Giants and Seahawks.

     Lions vs. Vikings: 3 burning questions ahead of big-time Week 14 game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DETROIT -- There are playoff dreams and division-clinching implications on the line in the Week 14 game between the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings.
We’ll try and answer three burning questions ahead of kickoff below:What to expect from Lions WR Jameson Williams in Game 2?
They’ll get him on check downs, and they’re running kind of choice routes like we do with (Amon-Ra St. Brown) Saint, some of those things.
Jared Goff and Amon-Ra St. Brown have been cooking with fire since last month’s game in Chicago.
St. Brown is the third-highest-ranked receiver by Pro Football Focus through those four games.

     RECAP: Lions vs. Vikings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He completed 27 of his 39 passes for 330 yards with those three touchdowns and no turnovers for a 120.7 passer rating.
Cousins was also good for the Vikings, completing 31-of-41 passes for 426 yards and two touchdowns and no turnovers for a 124.6 rating.
Key moment: With just over one minute left in the first half and the Vikings trailing 14-7, Minnesota was looking to tie the game with a first and goal at the Lions' 3-yard line.
It was a huge play for the Lions' defense because the Vikings had a chance to double up as they received the second-half kickoff.
Instead, Minnesota turned it over and then went three and out on their first possession of the second half.
