    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PITTSBURGH -- Steelers rookie quarterback Kenny Pickett's first taste of the Baltimore Ravens rivalry ended abruptly when he entered the concussion protocol in the first quarter and never returned in Sunday's 16-14 loss.
But after entering the protocol following that series, he didn't come back out for the Steelers' third drive, and backup Mitch Trubisky checked in.
"When he became symptomatic, he was pulled from the game and evaluated for concussion," coach Mike Tomlin said afterward.
Trubisky also finished the Steelers' Week 6 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after Pickett entered the concussion protocol in the first half.
In that game, Trubisky completed 9 of 12 attempts for 144 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers' 20-18 win.
