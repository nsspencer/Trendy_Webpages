     The Element Of High On Life That Has Critics Divided
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to the "High on Life" Metacritic score, there is a lot to love about this first-person shooter.
However, some critics have argued that the comedy in "High on Life" isn't for everyone.
For example, Chris Carter at Destructoid wasn't very impressed with "High on Life" overall, awarding it a 5.5 out of 10.
This wasn't a case of not enjoying Squanch's sensibilities, either, as Carter noted that he thought "Trover Saves the Universe" was much more successful in the comedy department.
Edwin Evans-Thirlwell at Eurogamer was another critic who didn't enjoy the humor of "High on Life," calling it a "botched attempt to rebottle 'Rick and Morty' as a first-person shooter."

It's on this side of Rick and Morty that High on Life draws most frequently.
High on Life is 10-to-15 hours of things he'd do away with, which is why it hates itself so much.

     Summary: High on Life takes a lot of design cues from Metroid Prime, delivering a first-person adventure game with an emphasis on platforming.
Though High on Life will largely be judged on its humor, its strengths as an adventure game shouldn’t be overlooked.
As an adventure game, High on Life excels most of all when it comes to its aesthetic.
Though High on Life will largely be judged on its humor, its strengths as an adventure game shouldn’t be overlooked.
