    </h2>

     Summary: Broncos QB Russell Wilson is shaken up after taking a big hit and does not return to the game.
(0:33)DENVER -- Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson left Sunday's 34-28 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs early in the fourth quarter after he was slammed to the ground on a scramble, and was ruled out with a concussion.
The Broncos fell behind 27-0 in the second quarter, but Wilson threw two touchdown passes to Jerry Jeudy just before halftime.
Wilson threw his third touchdown pass on the Broncos' first possession of the second half when his screen pass to running back Marlon Mack turned into a 66-yard catch-and-run touchdown.
Wilson will be in the concussion protocol this week, so his status for Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals is uncertain.

     Broncos QB Russell Wilson suffers concussion in second half of loss to Chiefs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson did not return to Sunday's 34-28 loss the Chiefs after sustaining a concussion in the fourth quarter.
Wilson was injured at the tail end of a 14-yard scramble when Chiefs defender Frank Clark seemingly put all of his body weight onto the Broncos QB as he made the tackle.
Wilson lied still on the turf as the Broncos medical staff rushed to his aid.
He slowly got up and walked to the sideline under his own power before going to the blue medical tent and finally the locker room.
Brett Rypien relieved Wilson upon his exit and finished the drive with a touchdown pass to Jerry Jeudy, bringing the Broncos to within six points in the final frame.
