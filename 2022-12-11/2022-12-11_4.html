     Jerry Rice Calls Out 49ers After Deebo Samuel Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deebo Samuel was carted off the field Sunday with a reported ankle injury after a designed run play for the wide receiver and one former 49ers star took exception with the play call.
Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice took to Instagram and called out the team for putting its star wide receiver in the backfield.
Samuel’s use in the run game was a major storyline in the offseason with the wide receiver reportedly taking issue with being used as a running back.
Samuel reportedly requested a trade in April because of the usage but both sides appeared to work out a resolution.
So far this season, Samuel has caught 50 passes for 569 yards and two touchdowns but has also rushed the ball 37 times in his 11 appearances this season.
