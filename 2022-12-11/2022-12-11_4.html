     Bills All Right With Miller Lite: Defense Passes Another Test Without Von
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In earning a crucial victory over AFC East competition, the Bills enjoyed one of their finer defensive performances of the season.
The (defensive) line has been crazy all year long," safety Jordan Poyer told NFL Network.
The Bills were officially credited with four sacks (two to Gregory Rousseau) and eight further quarterback hits in the win.
"(The defensive line was) playing hard, coming off the ball, establishing the line of scrimmage,” head coach Sean McDermott said of his front men's efforts.

     Top 3 things we learned from Bills vs. Jets | Week 14
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Five punts marked the most in a game by the Bills this season and they all came in the first half.
The league's number one third down offense struggled to move the chains as they went 2-for-8 on conversions in the first half and went 0-for-5 in the second half.
The Bills added a second touchdown drive in the third quarter after the Jets tied the game at seven on their first possession of the second half.
The offensive line was responsible for six of the team's seven penalties in the game as the Jets' defensive front again proved formidable.
"We've got to end the game with the ball in our hands and not put that much stress on our defense."
