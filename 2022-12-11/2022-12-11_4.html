     Summary: The odd part about it is the Steelers said Pickett was cleared to return after being evaluated for a concussion, and he came back for a series.
Trubisky came in after that series, and the Steelers then said Pickett was ruled out and in the concussion protocol.
Pickett came in after he was hit hard by Smith and cleared, the Steelers went three-and-out with Pickett throwing incomplete on his only attempt, and then the Steelers decided to pull him for Trubisky.
Pickett was ruled out shortly thereafter with the team saying he was in the concussion protocol.
On Sunday, they had to turn to Trubisky for the rest of the game after Pickett was finally ruled out.
