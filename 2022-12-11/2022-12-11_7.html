     Chiefs vs. Broncos: Week 14 Preview and Predictions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It can't be a rivalry renewed until the Broncos snap out of their cold spell against the Chiefs.
The Broncos’ defense is no joke — they’ll be another solid test for the Chiefs’ o-line issues, but it needs to be a get-right day for KC’s front seven on defense.
Prediction: Chiefs 24, Broncos 17Mark Van Sickle: The Chiefs are looking to make it 14 in a row against the Broncos, with Patrick Mahomes looking to go 10-0 against them.
The defense should be able to keep this unimpressive Broncos offense in check, and Kansas City's offense should score enough to win by double digits.
Prediction: Chiefs 27, Broncos 12

The Broncos' tight end may be key to this game, too.
The Broncos will need as many of their top weapons rolling as possible against a Chiefs defense that has struggled against the pass but been solid vs. the run.
