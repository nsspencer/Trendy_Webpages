     Ravens vs. Steelers - NFL Game Recap - December 11, 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mitch Trubisky replaces Kenny Pickett after an injury and throws three interceptions in the Steelers' loss.
PITTSBURGH -- — Baltimore's veterans kept telling their younger teammates they couldn't really consider themselves Ravens until they beat the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Now J.K. Dobbins and Anthony Brown are part of the lore in a rivalry with plenty of juice, even as the Steelers rebuild.
Against the Steelers, Dobbins and the rest of the Ravens went far enough to effectively end any outside shot the Steelers (5-8) had of being a factor down the stretch.
Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said Pickett became “symptomatic” but could not provide clarity on why Pickett was initially allowed to return.

     Ravens vs. Steelers: 4 game ball candidates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a predictable gritty, low-scoring affair, the Ravens’ rushing prowess and defensive takeaways won out.
Smith was a force in the run game as well again, helping limit the Steelers to just 65 rushing yards on 20 carries.
He consistently churned out positive yardage on the ground and wound up finishing with a game-leading 120 rushing yards on 15 attempts.
The Steelers had no timeouts remaining, allowing the Ravens to kneel the ball and run out the clock.
Ronnie Stanley’s return at left tackle helped rejuvinate the Ravens’ rushing attack, even in the absence of starting right guard Kevin Zeitler.
