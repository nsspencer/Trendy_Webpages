     49ers WR Deebo Samuel carted off in first half vs. Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Niners WR Deebo Samuel appears to injure his leg after getting taken down awkwardly and is carted off to the locker room.
Wide receiver Deebo Samuel departed Sunday's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with a left knee injury with about five minutes left in the second quarter.
As a pair of Buccaneers defenders converged on Samuel, he attempted to spin out and appeared to get his left knee twisted in an awkward direction.
Most of the 49ers' roster quickly ran on the field to be close to Samuel while the medical staff checked on him as San Francisco fans chanted, "Dee-bo, Dee-bo."
Samuel had his hands on his left knee and his head down as the cart disappeared into the Niners' tunnel.
