     Nuclear Fusion Energy Breakthrough: Watch LLNL Announcement Live Online
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A major breakthrough in nuclear fusion by researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California will be announced by Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm at 10 a.m.
Private investment in nuclear fusion has skyrocketed during 2022, as concerns over climate change and the energy crisis sway the direction of global funding.
Clearly, this requires a lot of energy, so making a net energy gain out of nuclear fusion has so far been impossible.
However, researchers at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory may have just successfully overcome this barrier.
The Lawrence Livermore National Ignition Facility creates nuclear energy from a fusion process called "thermonuclear inertial fusion."

     US scientists may have reached a breakthrough in nuclear fusion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nuclear fusion — when two hydrogen nuclei combine to form a single helium atom, releasing a burst of energy — is a prospect that has both tantalized and eluded scientists for decades.
The Department of Energy said it will announce a “major scientific breakthrough” on Tuesday at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
“The goal was to do essentially what they have just done,” he said, adding this approach is one of a few leading methods to producing nuclear fusion.
Efforts to successfully create a net gain nuclear fusion reaction have spanned the public and private sectors.
According to a 2022 survey conducted by the Fusion Industry Association, more than 30 companies are working on developing nuclear fusion technology, representing over $4.8 billion in funding.

     Nuclear fusion: harnessing the power of the stars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here is an update on how nuclear fusion works, what projects are underway and estimates on when they could be completed:Energy of the starsFusion differs from fission, the technique currently used in nuclear power plants, by fusing two atomic nuclei instead of splitting one.
One method is to "confine" the fusion reaction with magnets.
A second method is inertial confinement fusion, in which high energy lasers are directed simultaneously into a thimble-sized cylinder containing the hydrogen.
This technique is used by the French Megajoule Laser (LMJ), and the world's most advanced fusion project, the California-based National Ignition Facility (NIF).
Nuclear fusion also produces much less radioactive waste than current power plants, and above all, emits no greenhouse gases.

     Summary: The U.S. reaches a fusion power milestone.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Damien Jemison/LLNL/NNSA Damien Jemison/LLNL/NNSAScientists with the U.S. Department of Energy will announce a breakthrough in nuclear fusion later today.
The energy out significantly exceeded the energy the lasers put in, according to sources familiar with the result.
Researchers say that fusion energy could one day provide clean, safe electricity without greenhouse gas emissions.
Unless there's an even larger breakthrough, fusion is unlikely to play a major role in power production before the 2060s or 2070s, says Tony Roulstone, a nuclear engineer at Cambridge University in the U.K., who's done an economic analysis of fusion power.

     US scientists reach long-awaited nuclear fusion breakthrough, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Researchers for decades have attempted to recreate nuclear fusion – replicating the fusion that powers the sun.
Nuclear fusion happens when two or more atoms are fused into one larger one, a process that generates a massive amount of energy as heat.
With nuclear fusion, the fused product has less mass than the original atoms.
This heat can then be used to warm water, create steam and power turbines to generate power.
“The opposing argument is that this result is miles away from actual energy gain required for the production of electricity,” he said.
