     Josh Allen performs 360 hurdle for first down against Jets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hurdling Josh Allen is back but this time with a literal twist.
The Buffalo Bills and New York Jets started the game with six straight punts but Allen provided some offensive excitement.
Safety Lamarcus Joyner lowered his shoulder and Allen countered with a hurdle.
Allen nearly cleared Joyner but his feet clipped Joyner's back and the quarterback's body went parallel with the ground.
Jets linebacker Quincy Williams came in for a clean-up shot, which spun Allen 360-degrees in the air before he landed on his stomach.

     Dawson Knox somersaults into end zone to get Bills on the board
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- After starting the game against the New York Jets with five straight punts, the Buffalo Bills' offense got its first points of the day with a 24-yard touchdown pass from Josh Allen to tight end Dawson Knox.
The play completed a seven-play, 59-yard drive at the end of the first half, which was also by far the Bills' longest drive in terms of yardage.
Knox found the end zone by leaping over Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner and flipping past the goal line.
The 10 combined punts in the first half between the Jets and Bills are the most in a first half this season.
The score kept alive the Bills' streak of scoring in 43 consecutive halves, the longest active streak in the NFL.

     Summary: After the game, one reporter expressed concerns over the Bills’ offense and whether it was up to par for a Super Bowl run.
Allen hit the reporter with an “Okay,” in response to their critical comment about the Bills’ offense, showing that he wasn’t interested in any doubts over the team.
It certainly wasn’t the Bills’ best offensive performance, as the scrappy Jets’ defense held them to just 20 points.
In regards to criticisms of the offense, Allen doesn’t have time for it.
He knows exactly what this Bills team is capable of, even if they didn’t show it on Sunday.

     Summary: ORCHARD PARK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 13: Josh Allen #17 of the Buffalo Bills signals for a first down during the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings at Highmark Stadium on November 13, 2022 in Orchard Park, New York.
(Photo by Timothy T Ludwig/Getty Images) Timothy T Ludwig/Getty ImagesJosh Allen wasn't happy with a report after Sunday's win over the New York Jets.
Allen finished Sunday's performance with 147 yards through the air and one touchdown.
The Bills have scored 20+ points in their last five games, which is pretty good in today's NFL.
Allen will look to put this reporter's comment to shame when the Bills take on the Miami Dolphins next Saturday night.

     Bills' Josh Allen: Mistake-free in Week 14 win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Allen completed 16 of 27 passes for 147 yards and one touchdown while rushing 10 times for 47 yards and another touchdown in Sunday's 20-12 win over the Jets.
After holding Allen without a passing touchdown in their previous meeting, the ferocious Jets defense gave him trouble early in this one, as Buffalo punted on each of its first two possessions for the first time in 18 games.
The Bills punted on their next three drives as well before the Jets gifted them a fourth down conversion with an encroachment penalty, and Allen capitalized by capping that drive with a 24-yard touchdown pass to Dawson Knox in the final minute of the first half.
After the Jets tied the game early in the third, Allen answered with a five-yard touchdown run as the Bills took the lead for good.
The dual-threat quarterback has thrown 26 touchdowns and rushed for another six heading into a Week 15 home game against the Dolphins.

     Dawson Knox's full-flip TD saves us from first scoreless NFL first half since 2019
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In their first 12 games of the 2022 season, the Buffalo Bills had punted just 27 times, the NFL’s lowest total.
The Bills made up for that in the wrong direction this Sunday against the New York Jets by punting on their first five possessions.
The Jets were similarly hospitable, punting on each of their five possessions in the first half.
And then, Josh Allen threw this ball to tight end Dawson Knox, which took us out of that particular scoreless nightmare.
With 1:17 left in the first half, the Bills had fourth-and-1 from their own 39-yard line.
