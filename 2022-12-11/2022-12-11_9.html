     Bulls hope to carry forward offensive identity from blowout win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Billy Donovan has said his preferred offensive formula for the Chicago Bulls is for them to have five to seven players in double figures and at least 25 assists.
In a nod to the blowout and the Bulls finishing a back-to-back on Sunday in Atlanta, LaVine only played 27 minutes.
But if their commitment to this offensive identity stays consistent, it's likely an offensive rating that has languished near the bottom third of the league all season will rise.
“We shared the ball,” LaVine said.
“I think we played as a team and played to our strengths.

Billy Donovan still describes that management as a day-by-day process, coordinated in collaboration with LaVine and the Bulls’ medical staff, and taking into account LaVine’s workload and physical condition.
I feel good.”And lo and behold, when the Bulls' first injury report was released Sunday morning, LaVine was unlisted.
But it is clear that LaVine hopes knee management is a thing of the past moving forward as well.
And if it’s up to LaVine, he will be out there for every game moving forward to continue the process.
