     Summary: Rushing for 224 yards on 45 carries got the job done as the Panthers defeated the Seattle Seahawks, 30-24.
The Panthers came out of the gates swinging, jumping out to a 17-0 lead thanks to a dominant run game and stout defensive play.
Seattle limited the Panthers to an Eddy Pineiro 47-yard field goal, but the drive took up nearly eight minutes of game time.
On the first play from scrimmage for Seattle, Jaycee Horned picked off Geno Smith and returned it to the 15.
Seattle was unable to recover the onside kick and the Panthers took a knee to drain the remaining seconds off the clock.

     WATCH: Panthers WR Terrace Marshall Jr. catches ball with his legs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you’re a pass catcher, your arms and hands are for catching and your legs and feet are for running.
But Carolina Panthers receiver Terrace Marshall Jr. might have his body parts a bit mixed up.
In the third quarter of Carolina’s Week 14 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks, the second-year wideout literally caught a pass using his legs.
But after review, the catch stood and the highlight is now forever cemented as one of the oddest receptions you’ll ever see.
The drive, however, would eventually be halted at the 3-yard line—as the Panthers turned the rock over on downs on a fourth-and-goal incompletion.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SEATTLE — The Panthers have done some good things in the last two months, but interim coach Steve Wilks has continued to insist they had to finish.
Coupled with the Buccaneers' loss at San Francisco, the Panthers are just a game out of first place in the NFC South.
They also did it with a bludgeoning run game as they continued to build on a physical identity.
But the Panthers didn't fold, playing sharply in the second half when they needed it the most.
— Long snapper JJ Jansen broke the franchise's all-time games played record, appearing in his 222nd career game.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Terrace Marshall Jr.'s catch was so unbelievable, the Seattle Seahawks challenged it.
They probably couldn't fathom that the Carolina Panthers receiver caught a pass with his legs.
Somehow, Sam Darnold's pass went through Marshall's arms, which isn't good, but he kept focus and held onto the ball between his legs.
When the ball started to slip through, he pinned it to the back of his legs with his hands as he rolled.
Panthers coaches probably would have been happier if Marshall had just caught the ball when it hit his hands, but then we wouldn't have that slick highlight.

     Summary: The Panthers started fast in Seattle by playing physical man-to-man defense against Seahawks Pro Bowl receivers DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett.
Then the offense fed off a tone the Panthers defense set.
The Panthers’ defense forced two turnovers, held Seattle’s fifth-ranked offense two points under its season-scoring average and sacked or hit Smith eight times.
The Panthers’ opportunistic defense changed the game, limiting Smith to a 58% completion percentage (14 points lower than his league-leading completion percentage).
