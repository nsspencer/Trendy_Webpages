     Steelers' Kenny Pickett put in concussion protocol in loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PITTSBURGH -- Steelers rookie quarterback Kenny Pickett's first taste of the Baltimore Ravens rivalry ended abruptly when he entered the concussion protocol in the first quarter and never returned in Sunday's 16-14 loss.
But after entering the protocol following that series, he didn't come back out for the Steelers' third drive, and backup Mitch Trubisky checked in.
"When he became symptomatic, he was pulled from the game and evaluated for concussion," coach Mike Tomlin said afterward.
Trubisky also finished the Steelers' Week 6 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after Pickett entered the concussion protocol in the first half.
In that game, Trubisky completed 9 of 12 attempts for 144 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers' 20-18 win.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The odd part about it is the Steelers said Pickett was cleared to return after being evaluated for a concussion, and he came back for a series.
Trubisky came in after that series, and the Steelers then said Pickett was ruled out and in the concussion protocol.
Pickett came in after he was hit hard by Smith and cleared, the Steelers went three-and-out with Pickett throwing incomplete on his only attempt, and then the Steelers decided to pull him for Trubisky.
Pickett was ruled out shortly thereafter with the team saying he was in the concussion protocol.
On Sunday, they had to turn to Trubisky for the rest of the game after Pickett was finally ruled out.
