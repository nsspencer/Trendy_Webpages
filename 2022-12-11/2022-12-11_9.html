    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Opening statements in the trial of Tory Lanez, the rapper accused of shooting fellow rapper Megan Thee Stallion in the foot, began on Monday in Los Angeles.
On 20 August, after weeks of speculation, Pete went on Instagram Live to say Peterson shot her.
The incident has resulted in a fallout that has largely played out online, with both artists using their music and social media to express their sides of the story.
Photograph: Étienne Laurent/EPAPete has vehemently denied ever being in a romantic relationship with Peterson, including during a high-profile interview with Gayle King.
She allegedly told him that Peterson shot at her feet while she stood outside the SUV the pair and their associates were riding in.

     Megan Thee Stallion’s Friend to Testify She Saw Tory Lanez Fire Gun
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harris was Megan’s best friend and assistant at the time, and her first-person account is considered crucial considering Lanez’s insistence he’s not the triggerman.
Bott said Harris will testify she freaked out when Lanez approached the two women after he fired five shots.
Bott told jurors that Harris quickly sent three highly critical text messages to Megan’s bodyguard Justin Edison in the five minutes following the shooting.
In his opening, Bott said a highly intoxicated Peterson brandished the gun after Megan dissed his musical talent.
According to Megan, Peterson offered both women money for their silence, an allegation Peterson denies.
