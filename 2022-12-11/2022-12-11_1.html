     Brock Purdy, 49ers spoil Tom Brady homecoming in lopsided win over Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Final Tampa Bay Buccaneers 7 San Francisco 49ers 35Tom Brady returned to face the 49ers in the Bay Area for only the second time in his career, but Brock Purdy and a stout defense turned the homecoming into a nightmare.
The Week 14 contest between the San Francisco 49ers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers could have been viewed as a “David versus Goliath” contest, at least in terms of the quarterbacks involved at the square-off at Levi’s Stadium.
On the Bucs’ end, Tom Brady, the greatest to ever do it under center.
Purdy looked like he was a three-year veteran under center against a Bucs defense that entered the contest ranked fifth best in scoring.
Samuel fumbled on the play, and Tampa Bay recovered.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Brady, who arrives back home to play the 49ers, is also a pending free agent.
"When the 49ers scout came in during the season, he said, 'Man, this Brock Purdy had this incredible camp,'" Campbell recounted.
He's got some of those really special intangibles that make really special quarterbacks."
As 49ers teammates have recounted this week, Purdy holds everyone accountable regardless of who they are.
Campbell says Purdy's the most competitive human he's ever come across and he conducts himself that way, as well.
