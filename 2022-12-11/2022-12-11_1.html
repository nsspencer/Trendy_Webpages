     Summary: Cowboys squeak out win over TexansAre you surprised that it was a struggle for the Cowboys to beat the losing Texans?
It's what they do - beat the teams they should lose to, and lose to the teams they should beat.
The Cowboys, on the other hand, who are a better team in every single aspect, struggled to get past the Texans defense and made all kinds of mistakes on offense.
They will face the Jacksonville Jaguars next week (the only team the Texans have managed to beat).
The Texans defense forced the Cowboys into three turnovers (nearly four).

     Game Recap: Cowboys Rally For 27-23 Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trailing by six points heading into the final quarter, the Cowboys were able to rally over the final 15 minutes with 10 unanswered points.
But the turnover bug again bit the Cowboys, Prescott throwing yet another interception late in the first half.
Driskel was stopped on fourth-and-goal from the 3-yard line, the Cowboys getting the ball back with 3:20 left on the clock.
When Mills found Moore in the middle for 31 yards to the Dallas 44-yard line, Cowboys Nation was more than a little anxious.
But Houston left tackle Laremy Tunsil was then called for false start penalties on consecutive plays, leaving Mills to try a final Hail Mary into the end zone.
