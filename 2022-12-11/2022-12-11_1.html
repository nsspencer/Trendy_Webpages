     Summary: And yet somehow the Cowboys left AT&amp;T Stadium on Sunday with a 27-23 win against the Texans.
On Nov. 20, the Cowboys had their largest road win in franchise history, beating the Minnesota Vikings 40-3.
Prescott also believes this win, against the now 1-11-1 Texans, could end up being important.
"You got to play games like [this], one-score games here in the back end against our division or whether it be the playoffs.
Despite the win, the Cowboys fear right tackle Terence Steele sustained a serious injury to his left knee, according to multiple sources.

There is a tendency to think of the Cowboys as perennially pretty good and to think of Houston as ... not that.

     Summary: Cowboys squeak out win over TexansAre you surprised that it was a struggle for the Cowboys to beat the losing Texans?
It's what they do - beat the teams they should lose to, and lose to the teams they should beat.
The Cowboys, on the other hand, who are a better team in every single aspect, struggled to get past the Texans defense and made all kinds of mistakes on offense.
They will face the Jacksonville Jaguars next week (the only team the Texans have managed to beat).
The Texans defense forced the Cowboys into three turnovers (nearly four).

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It might not always be the cheapest, but when it doubt, get in the car and make a drive.
That is, until the Cowboys decided to make a stand ... a defensive stand.
I know I didn't see anyone in Dak's face on that final drive, and the Cowboys offense just carved up the Texans like a surgeon.
That was an amazing drive by the Cowboys, but fitting to the entire day, you just knew it wasn't going to be over like that.
But as close as it was at the end, I really think the Cowboys win this one about 35-7 if KaVontae Turpin doesn't fumble in the first quarter.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trailing by six points heading into the final quarter, the Cowboys were able to rally over the final 15 minutes with 10 unanswered points.
But the turnover bug again bit the Cowboys, Prescott throwing yet another interception late in the first half.
Driskel was stopped on fourth-and-goal from the 3-yard line, the Cowboys getting the ball back with 3:20 left on the clock.
When Mills found Moore in the middle for 31 yards to the Dallas 44-yard line, Cowboys Nation was more than a little anxious.
But Houston left tackle Laremy Tunsil was then called for false start penalties on consecutive plays, leaving Mills to try a final Hail Mary into the end zone.
