     Steelers' Kenny Pickett Replaced by Mitchell Trubisky vs. Ravens After Concussion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joe Sargent/Getty ImagesPittsburgh Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett left Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens to be tested for a concussion and was replaced by veteran Mitchell Trubisky, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.
He was then ruled out for the remainder of the game and placed in the concussion protocol, according to Brooke Pryor of ESPN.
Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin made the change during the Week 4 loss to the New York Jets.
Trubisky is the same player he's been for years, while Pickett hasn't excelled in a small sample to date.
Improved quarterback play, be it from Trubisky or Pickett, can only go so far for this team.

     Summary: The odd part about it is the Steelers said Pickett was cleared to return after being evaluated for a concussion, and he came back for a series.
Trubisky came in after that series, and the Steelers then said Pickett was ruled out and in the concussion protocol.
Pickett came in after he was hit hard by Smith and cleared, the Steelers went three-and-out with Pickett throwing incomplete on his only attempt, and then the Steelers decided to pull him for Trubisky.
Pickett was ruled out shortly thereafter with the team saying he was in the concussion protocol.
On Sunday, they had to turn to Trubisky for the rest of the game after Pickett was finally ruled out.
