     Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried refuses to testify before Senate, committee says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and chief executive officer of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, speaks during a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Feb. 9, 2022.
Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is refusing to testify at a hearing this week about his company's implosion, the Senate Banking Committee said Monday.
Attorneys for the crypto platform's founder have also said Bankman-Fried, who is based in the Bahamas, will not accept service of a subpoena to compel his testimony before the panel, senators said.
Bankman-Fried is scheduled to appear at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday that will focus on his company's collapse.
In a joint statement, Senate Banking Chair Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio and ranking member Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said they have "offered Sam Bankman-Fried two different dates for providing testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and are willing to accommodate virtual testimony."

     Summary: What to watch: This comes ahead of criminal charges that will be announced later this morning by prosecutors for the Southern District of New York.
The SEC — which filed the complaint in a New York federal court — also noted that SBF is expected to face criminal charges.
Details: The SEC alleged that Bankman-Fried engaged in a "years-long" scheme to defraud investors.
"We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto," SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.
"The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws."

     FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Live Interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch Forbes Digital Assets Director Of Research’s live interview FTX Founder Sam Bankman-FriedUntil early November former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried could do no wrong.
Save for Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, nobody that young had ever gotten that rich.
But unlike other crypto titans, who have preferred to keep a low profile, Bankman-Fried’s cultivated media attention and was known to be a philanthropist who courted politicians, often via donations.
It all changed on November 2, when a leaked FTX balance sheet became public showing that his entire empire was being propped up by a crypto token, FTT, that he invented and largely controlled.
Its price crash from $26 to below $2 led to a run on FTX and ultimately its bankruptcy.

     FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried arrested in the Bahamas after U.S. files criminal charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNBC has confirmed that the charges against Bankman-Fried include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.
Bahamas Attorney General Ryan Pinder said the United States was "likely to request his extradition."
"While the United States is pursuing criminal charges against SBF individually, The Bahamas will continue its own regulatory and criminal investigations into the collapse of FTX, with the continued cooperation of its law enforcement and regulatory partners in the United States and elsewhere," the statement said.
The Bahamas and the United States have had an extradition treaty in place since the early 20th century, when the Bahamas was still under British control.
Legal experts told CNBC that if the federal government pursues wire or bank fraud charges, Bankman-Fried could face life in prison without the possibility of supervised release.

     SEC charges Sam Bankman-Fried with defrauding FTX investors as he built a crypto ‘house of cards’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York CNN —The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Sam Bankman-Fried on Tuesday with defrauding investors and customers in his failed crypto exchange FTX.
The SEC said Bankman-Fried, “orchestrated a years-long fraud” to conceal from FTX investors the diversion of customer funds to Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm.
“We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.
In reality, the complaint alleges, Bankman-Fried secretly diverted FTX customer funds to effectively provide an “unlimited ‘line of credit’” to Alameda.
Bankman-Fried didn’t just use the FTX customer funds to make risky bets at his hedge fund.

That triggered a bank run on its deposits, which eventually led to the exchange's insolvency.

"The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.

A representative for Bankman-Fried’s lawyer said the FTX founder would testify remotely from the Bahamas, where the company was based.
“We have offered Sam Bankman-Fried two different dates for providing testimony… and are willing to accommodate virtual testimony.
In FTX’s heyday, Bankman-Fried regularly appeared on congressional panels, charming lawmakers and pushing for light-touch regulation of the nascent industry.
Key questions that lawmakers and prosecutors are expected to focus on relate to the potential misuse of customer funds.
