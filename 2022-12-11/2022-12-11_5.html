     Steelers' Kenny Pickett in protocol, out for rest of game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PITTSBURGH -- Steelers rookie quarterback Kenny Pickett is in the concussion protocol and has been ruled out for the remainder of Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens.
Pickett took a hard sack at the end of the Steelers' first drive, brought down by Roquan Smith after slipping out of the Ravens' first sack attempt.
He was initially cleared and reentered the game for a second drive -- a quick three-and-out.
But he didn't come back out for the Steelers' third drive, and instead, backup Mitch Trubisky checked in.
Pickett also entered the concussion protocol in the first half in Week 6 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Trubisky played the second half in the 20-18 Steelers win.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The odd part about it is the Steelers said Pickett was cleared to return after being evaluated for a concussion, and he came back for a series.
Trubisky came in after that series, and the Steelers then said Pickett was ruled out and in the concussion protocol.
Pickett came in after he was hit hard by Smith and cleared, the Steelers went three-and-out with Pickett throwing incomplete on his only attempt, and then the Steelers decided to pull him for Trubisky.
Pickett was ruled out shortly thereafter with the team saying he was in the concussion protocol.
On Sunday, they had to turn to Trubisky for the rest of the game after Pickett was finally ruled out.
