     Jerry Rice Calls Out 49ers After Deebo Samuel Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deebo Samuel was carted off the field Sunday with a reported ankle injury after a designed run play for the wide receiver and one former 49ers star took exception with the play call.
Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice took to Instagram and called out the team for putting its star wide receiver in the backfield.
Samuel’s use in the run game was a major storyline in the offseason with the wide receiver reportedly taking issue with being used as a running back.
Samuel reportedly requested a trade in April because of the usage but both sides appeared to work out a resolution.
So far this season, Samuel has caught 50 passes for 569 yards and two touchdowns but has also rushed the ball 37 times in his 11 appearances this season.

     49ers' Deebo Samuel carted off field with ankle injury during matchup with Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers' injury struggles continued on Sunday during their Week 14 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Last week it was quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, this week, it was star wideout Deebo Samuel.
The star wideout was emotional while his teammates met him on the field to say goodbye.
The 49ers later ruled Samuel out for the remainder of the game with what they called an ankle injury.
If Samuel were to miss extended time or the rest of the season, it would be a huge hit to this 49ers offense.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Niners WR Deebo Samuel appears to injure his leg after getting taken down awkwardly and is carted off to the locker room.
(0:31)SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The San Francisco 49ers' dominant 35-7 victory against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday came with an encouraging arrival and a disappointing departure.
But the win didn't come without a cost as receiver Deebo Samuel suffered a left ankle injury in the second quarter and did not return.
In his postgame news conference, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said Samuel could have a high left ankle sprain.
Most of the Niners roster quickly ran on the field to be close to Samuel as the medical staff checked on him and San Francisco fans chanted "Dee-bo, Dee-bo."
