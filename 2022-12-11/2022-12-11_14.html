     Christian McCaffrey's big game lifts 49ers after Deebo Samuel injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christian McCaffrey started the day as one of two 49ers’ do-it-all offensive weapons.
The Niners will rely upon McCaffrey’s adaptability after Deebo Samuel, the other player capable of beating defenses as a wide receiver or a running back, went out with an ankle injury.
McCaffrey’s first touchdown of the game came with the nominal running back lined up at wide receiver.
In just three quarters of play, McCaffrey led the 49ers with 119 yards rushing on 14 carries, good for an average of 8.5 yards per rush.
His ability to play running back and wide receiver opens up Kyle Shanahan’s playbook and forces opposing defenses into difficult decisions without changing personnel.
