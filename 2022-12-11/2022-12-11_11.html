     Tee Higgins limited by hamstring injury during Cincinnati's Week 15 game vs. Cleveland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cincinnati Bengals receiver Tee Higgins was limited during Sunday's Week 15 win against the Cleveland Browns because of a hamstring injury he aggravated.
Bengals head coach Zac Taylor told reporters after the game that Higgins tweaked his injury during pregame warm-ups, adding that Higgins wanted to play through it.
Higgins' teammate, Tyler Boyd, dislocated his finger on quarterback Joe Burrow's first pass of the game.
The Bengals announced Boyd's return was questionable, and later downgraded Boyd to out for the rest of the game.
Higgins entered Sunday's game with 60 receptions for 861 yards and five touchdowns this season, his third with the Bengals.

     Zac Taylor drops stunning Tee Higgins injury revelation after win vs. Browns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Dan Fappiano · 2 min readWhile the Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Cleveland Browns in Week 14, wide receiver Tee Higgins managed to play just one snap.
Speaking after the win, Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said that Cincinnati didn’t want Higgins on the field at all.
Taylor added that the Bengals had some goal-line packages for Higgins if necessary, but in defeating the Browns 23-10, that plan didn’t come to fruition.
When healthy, Higgins has been a crucial part of the Bengals’ offense.
Whether he walked onto the field himself or the coaching staff put him in, Tee Higgins didn’t appear ready to play.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bengals, who were 6-point favorites most of the week, were suddenly just 4-point favorites at BetMGM on Sunday morning.
Maybe it's just a coincidence that Bengals receiver Tee Higgins played one snap on Sunday with an unannounced injury.
It was horrible for fantasy players who had Higgins and needed to win in Week 14 to make the playoffs.
Bengals coach Zac Taylor said Higgins, who has 861 yards this season and is one of the NFL's best receivers, was injured in warmups.
