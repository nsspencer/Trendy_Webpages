     Lions reportedly have surprising stance on Jared Goff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lions reportedly have surprising stance on Jared GoffThe Detroit Lions have made some big improvements in their second season under Dan Campbell.
The Lions view Jared Goff as their quarterback of the future, according to Ian Rapoport of NFL Media.
When the Lions acquired Goff as part of the blockbuster deal that sent Matthew Stafford to the Los Angeles Rams, the belief was that Goff would serve as a bridge starting quarterback for them.
It is unclear if the Lions ever felt that way, but Rapoport says they are pleased with the way Goff has played in 2022.
The Lions have won four of their last five games to improve to 5-7 on the season.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lions got a starting quarterback PLUS a significant haul of draft picks: two first-round selections, and a third-round pick.
By hand-picking the Lions as the destination for Stafford, the Rams were able to offload Goff’s God-awful contract.
explained it when the trade first happened, the Rams gave up a first-round pick and a third-round pick for Stafford — and a first-round pick to get the Lions to take Goff and his ill-advised second deal.
The thinking was that the Lions would pay, and play, Goff for two years.
As noted by NFL Media, the Lions now view Goff as their starter beyond 2022.

     Summary: DETROIT -- The Detroit Lions (6-7) are winners of five of their last six games, and while the young defense deserves a ton of credit, quarterback Jared Goff has been on the money during this stretch.

     Summary: The Lions kept the Vikings from clinching the NFC North on Sunday, beating Minnesota 34-23 in Detroit.
Lions quarterback Jared Goff was 27-of-39 passing for 330 yards and three touchdowns with zero interceptions; his 120.7 passer rating was his best since Week 4.
A late-game drive that bled six minutes off the clock and ended with a field goal limited Minnesota’s scoring chances.
At all times of the game, in all areas on the field, the Lions’ offense sliced through the Vikings’ defense like it was butter.

The smart money is on him making a big play for this defense down the stretch.
Goff had tons of time to throw the ball Sunday.
He wasn't sacked a single time and was hit just three times total.
Detroit also rushed for 134 yards and a touchdown, averaging 4.5 yards per carry.

     Summary: The future in the Motor City is bright, especially considering they still have an extra first-round draft pick in the 2023 draft, courtesy of the Los Angeles Rams and Matthew Stafford.
There’s a chance the Lions not only make the playoffs but have a top-five pick as well...this makes things very interesting.
One of the key pieces to Detroit’s sudden fortune has been quarterback Jared Goff.
AdvertisementThere are still several holes on the Lions’ roster, particularly on the defensive side of the ball, but Goff isn’t a franchise quarterback.
They won’t have another top-five draft pick for a long, long time, so the time to draft an elite quarterback prospect is right now.

     Summary: Most of the NFL world considers Jared Goff to be a bridge for the Lions, a starter to help them get to the real franchise starting QB at some point in the future.
As the Lions prepare to face the Vikings today, they do so with a 5-7 record and with Goff playing as well as he's played since 2018.
To be sure, Goff is on his best run since he led the Rams to Super Bowl LIII.
The only three players to have multiple games with four-plus TDs this season are Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen… and Goff.
This year under OC Ben Johnson, who has emerged as a potential head coach candidate himself, Goff has impressed.

The Lions, behind Jared Goff’s 330 passing yards and three touchdown passes and the team’s 134 rushing yards, helped upset their NFC North rivals, 34-23.
Goff would then throw a 48-yard touchdown pass to D.J.
Minnesota would cut the deficit to eight points thanks to a 23-yard touchdown pass from Kirk Cousins to Adam Thielen.
Cousins finished 31 for 41 with 425 passing yards and two touchdown passes – one to Thielen and the other to K.J.

“Here’s the one consistent is, man, just make the right decisions, take care of the football, and he’s done that,” Lions head coach Dan Campbell said after last week’s win over Jacksonville.
“And that’s five weeks going now and that’s a big part of the reason why we’re winning.
Jared Goff threw one touchdown in each of the first three quarters against the 10-win Minnesota Vikings on Sunday.
