     Seahawks: 6 takeaways from a shameful loss to the Panthers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s the story today for the Seattle Seahawks, who came in favored by four points against the visiting Carolina Panthers.
This is a team that they’re far superior to as far as the critical positions go and a team that they needed to beat to hang onto an NFC Playoff spot.
Despite all that and home-field advantage, Seattle came out and got a ‘thumpin’ from their conference rivals.
The Panthers took a 10-0 lead early after picking off Geno Smith’s first pass of the game and never looked back.
Here are six takeaways.

     Panthers interim HC Steve Wilks praises players for performing through 'tank'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s so damn easy to see why Steve Wilks has been called a “leader of men,” time and time again.
Wilks went on to say it was, and credited that feel to the continuous and admirable effort from his players.
And with everything that we’ve gone through, they’ve gone through with the different coaching changes, getting rid of players, the organization trying to tank it—all those different things.
Conventional wisdom would tell you that any team in that position could be set to pack it in—but not Wilks’ Panthers.
Since then, they’ve gone 4-3 and currently sit just one game back of the NFC South-leading Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

     Rapid Reactions: Panthers earn first road win of season, 30-24 in Seattle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SEATTLE — The Panthers have done some good things in the last two months, but interim coach Steve Wilks has continued to insist they had to finish.
The Panthers built a big early lead, and put a long touchdown drive on the board when they needed it most in the fourth quarter, and left Seattle with a win as rare as it was satisfying, beating the Seahawks 30-24 to improve to 5-8.
It was just their second win ever at Lumen Field (along with the 2015 game during the Super Bowl season), and it snapped a nine-game losing streak on the road overall, the longest in the league.
Coupled with the Buccaneers' loss at San Francisco, the Panthers are just a game out of first place in the NFC South.
They did it Sunday with a defense that came up at big times, with Jaycee Horn and CJ Henderson picking off MVP candidate Geno Smith, who had multiple interceptions for the first time this season.

     Panthers interim coach Steve Wilks is making a case to keep the job
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He moved into the big chair from the position of secondary coach after the owner fired head coach Matt Rhule and defensive coordinator Phil Snow after five weeks.
Wilks, if you’ll remember, was last seen as a full-time head coach being absolutely hosed by the then directionless (still directionless?)
In succeeding despite all of this, with four wins in the team’s last seven games, isn’t he displaying one of the best qualities you’d want from someone to lead your NFL team?
The good coaches don’t care and come to work anyway.
But if this is how he handles the worst of it, wouldn’t he be worth checking out during the good times?

     Summary: “We knew it before the game — play a full 60 minutes.
There was no immediate postgame word on Schultz, who left the game and did not return for the final minutes.
They went on to outshoot the Panthers 32-25 overall, clogging up the neutral zone and limiting odd-man rushes against that had plagued them during their losing streak.
And when that wasn’t enough, goalie Jones did the rest — especially on a first period penalty kill in which the Panthers unleashed five shots.
“And we needed that 60-minute performance to be able to push back in the right direction and our players did that.”

     Time to remove the interim tag: Steve Wilks should be the Panthers’ next head coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Carolina Panthers are close to instituting an all-out search for their next NFL head coach.
Wilks, Carolina’s interim head coach for the past two months, led the team to a 30-24 upset win on the road at Seattle on Sunday.
In their road win against Seattle on Sunday, Wilks ordered up another run-heavy game plan and Carolina responded with 223 rushing yards on 46 carries.
Wilks really didn’t get a good shot in Arizona, where he went 3-13 in one season as head coach and then got fired.
“We gotta go home and protect the bank,” said Wilks, referring to the Panthers’ Bank of America Stadium.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After earning first-and-goal from the Seattle Seahawks’ 3-yard line, Panthers offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo called four consecutive passing plays, and Carolina turned the ball over on downs.
The Seahawks came into the game with a bottom-five rushing defense, and the Panthers were happy to chip away at that foundation.
However, the Panthers defense was eventually able to clamp down, holding Seattle to a field goal despite good field position.
Running back Godwin Igwebuike had a 50-yard kick return at the end of the second quarter that set up a touchdown drive.
