     Summary: Hats off to a solid effort for the Denver Broncos, but they fell short for the tenth time in 13 games on Sunday.
The Broncos lost 34-28 to their division rivals, the Kansas City Chiefs.
Russell Wilson had arguably one of his best games in a Broncos uniform, throwing for 247yards and three touchdowns before leaving the game with a concussion.
Backup quarterback Brett Rypien came in to relieve Wilson and threw a touchdown to bring the game within six, but it wasn’t enough.
Usually, Twitter isn’t kind to them, especially after a loss.

     Summary: ENGLEWOOD, Colo. –– Broncos QB Russell Wilson will be in the league-mandated post-concussion protocol this week, putting his status up in the air for next Sunday’s game against the Arizona Cardinals.
He walked off the field flanked by Broncos medical personnel before undergoing tests that confirmed the concussion.

     Summary: It all helped the Chiefs tally their 10th win on the year, marking the eighth-consecutive season that Coach Reid has led Kansas City to 10 or more victories.
Additionally, the Chiefs have now won 14-straight games over Denver, amassing the fifth-longest streak for any team against a single opponent in league history.
Mahomes, meanwhile, moved to 25-3 vs. AFC West opponents in his career, including a 15-0 mark in road divisional games.
Mahomes also topped 4,000 passing yards for the season in Sunday's victory, tallying his NFL-most fourth season with 4,000+ passing yards and 30+ passing touchdowns since 2018.
"Every quarterback who has played in this league a while is going to have a game like that," Reid said.

They fell to 3-8 in one-score games — including 1-7 in their last eight games decided by one score.
The total of 11 one-score games is just one off the franchise record of 12, set in 1994 and 2015.
This is notable because against non-AFC West opponents, the Broncos surrender an average of just 1.7 touchdowns per home game in that span.
Denver surrenders an average of 29.5 points per game to division rivals since 2020, compared with 18.1 to everyone else.

     Summary: Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson suffered a concussion in the fourth quarter against the Chiefs, and was soon ruled out for the rest of the game.
Wilson took a hit on a running play in the red zone and appeared to be knocked unconscious.
Wilson slowly walked off the field under his own power with the Broncos' medical team, but he would not return.
Even with three interceptions off Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Wilson throwing three touchdowns, they were unable to keep up with Kansas City.
Now, all eyes will be on Wilson to see if he'll be able to play in Week 15 against Arizona.

Head Coach Nathaniel Hackett called Wilson's read-option call "one of the best play calls of the night," and Wilson's mobility helped spark the Broncos to their best performance of the season.
The diving effort was the latest example of Wilson's relentless pursuit to help the Broncos get back in the win column.
"I think that really allowed us to get on the ball, really try to be in attack mode.
We know when you're playing the Chiefs, they're going to continually score and they're going to continually be aggressive.

The Broncos' offense put up a season-high 28 points, while the defense allowed 27 points and picked off Patrick Mahomes three times.
Defense: Josey Jewell | LB | Grade: 71.7Jewell was all over the field for the Broncos' defense and baited Mahomes into a couple of interceptions.
