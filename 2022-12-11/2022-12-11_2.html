     Despite win over Jets, Bills offensive line still a major issue that’s been ignored
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The offensive line has frequently appeared in my weekly Studs and Duds columns, and not in the positive column.
The offensive line was also called for seven penalties, five of them accepted.
The mistakes by the offensive line not only put the Bills in consistent long down-to-gain situations but effectively killed more than a few drives.
All of that is just a small slice of the impact the offensive line can have on the game.
If the offensive line keeps playing like this, that’s going to be a tough ask.
