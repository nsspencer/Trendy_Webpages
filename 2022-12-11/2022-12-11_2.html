     Brock Purdy, 49ers spoil Tom Brady homecoming in lopsided win over Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Final Tampa Bay Buccaneers 7 San Francisco 49ers 35Tom Brady returned to face the 49ers in the Bay Area for only the second time in his career, but Brock Purdy and a stout defense turned the homecoming into a nightmare.
The Week 14 contest between the San Francisco 49ers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers could have been viewed as a “David versus Goliath” contest, at least in terms of the quarterbacks involved at the square-off at Levi’s Stadium.
On the Bucs’ end, Tom Brady, the greatest to ever do it under center.
Purdy looked like he was a three-year veteran under center against a Bucs defense that entered the contest ranked fifth best in scoring.
Samuel fumbled on the play, and Tampa Bay recovered.

     Brock Purdy’s family wanted to see 49ers-Bucs to admire Tom Brady

     Summary: (Photo by Carmen Mandato/Getty Images)The family of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy planned to see the 49ers play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — not to watch Brock, but to see Tom Brady.
Tom Brady is one of the most famous sons of San Mateo, California, and it’s no secret that he was raised a devout San Francisco 49ers fan.
The family of starting quarterback Brock Purdy, which hails from Queen Creek, AZ, planned to make the trip for this fortuitous matchup, long before they ever knew Brock would be starting for the game.
Brock Purdy’s family has not traveled to many 49ers games this season, but it made plans to travel to this one today well in advance because of…Tom Brady.
— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 11, 2022Brock Purdy’s family came all the way to San Francisco to see Tom Brady in actionAlthough it’s slightly humiliating for a player’s whole family to come to a game to watch an opponent, they can hardly be blamed — it’s Tom Brady, after all.

     Summary: Tom Brady, who arrives back home to play the 49ers, is also a pending free agent.
"When the 49ers scout came in during the season, he said, 'Man, this Brock Purdy had this incredible camp,'" Campbell recounted.
He's got some of those really special intangibles that make really special quarterbacks."
As 49ers teammates have recounted this week, Purdy holds everyone accountable regardless of who they are.
Campbell says Purdy's the most competitive human he's ever come across and he conducts himself that way, as well.
