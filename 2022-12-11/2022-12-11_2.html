     Brock Purdy looking good as 49ers lead Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe 49ers are down to their third-string rookie quarterback, but that’s just fine.
Brock Purdy, the final pick in the 2022 NFL draft who is now starting for the 49ers, is in command of the San Francisco offense and has the 49ers up 14-0 over the Buccaneers.
Purdy has completed five of his seven passes for 48 yards, and also ran for a two-yard touchdown, and everything is going right for the 49ers.
Buccaneers left tackle Donovan Smith, who holds on almost every play, was flagged for a costly holding penalty today that negated a long touchdown pass from Tom Brady to Mike Evans.
This has the feel of a game that could get ugly for Tampa Bay.

     49ers-Buccaneers inactives: Nick Bosa to play in key Week 14 NFC matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the 49ers take on Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday, the seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback will have star defensive end Nick Bosa to worry about.
Bosa, who was listed as questionable on Friday's report with a hamstring injury, will play in the key NFC matchup at Levi's Stadium.
ESPN's Adam Schefter first reported on Saturday night that Bosa would play, citing a source.
The NFC Defensive Player of the Month for November currently leads the NFL with 14.5 sacks through the 11 games he has played this season.
The pass rusher previously missed San Francisco's Week 6 game against the Atlanta Falcons with a groin injury.

     Summary: What will Buccaneers life be like after Tom Brady?
Despite the fact that this game has all of the makings of a classic for Tom Brady and the Buccaneers, the matchup against the 49ers is going to be brutal for Tampa.
Tom Brady coming home means nothing.
It is fair to say that this game is going to be very low scoring for both sides.
One way or another, this matchup is going to be tough for the Buccaneers.

     Summary: I had zero faith in the abilities that you could provide to keep the 49ers alive going forward.
Purdy proved to be an upgrade in the 49ers win against the Buccaneers.
Purdy gives the 49ers an element to their offense that they were never going to get with Garoppolo.
If Purdy is going to sustain this level of play, then the 49ers going on a run in the playoffs is alive and well.
No offense can figure out how to gash them severely to the point where the 49ers offense needs to drop significant points.

All three are on the Buccaneers' Week 14 inactive list.

     Summary: GAME ESSENTIALS: Buccaneers (6-6) vs. 49ers (8-4) at Levi’s Stadium, at 1:25 p.m. (PT).
Brock Purdy will start his first NFL game Sunday against the Buccaneers in counterpart Tom Brady’s 329th regular-season start.
The 49ers hope Purdy can be the first quarterback to beat Brady in his first career start, as all six who have come before him over Brady’s 23-year career have failed.
The 49ers, despite losing Jimmy Garoppolo to a foot fracture last week, enter the game riding a five-game win streak.
Bosa had three sacks, including a late strip-sack, in last week’s win against Miami, and leads the NFL entering Sunday with 14.5.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel was carted off the field on Sunday afternoon with a brutal ankle injury.
Samuel, just before halftime of their 35-7 blowout win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, fumbled after a three-yard run up the middle of the field.
Specifics about his injury are not yet known, though coach Kyle Shanahan said after that it's "most likely" a high ankle sprain.
Samuel's ankle isn't broken, and he's believed to have avoided a major injury.
The 49ers, behind a huge night from rookie Brock Purdy, flew past Tom Brady and the Bucs for a dominant 27-point win.
