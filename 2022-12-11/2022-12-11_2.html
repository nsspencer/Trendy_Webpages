    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Buffalo Bills had some revenge on their minds headed into Sunday's divisional matchup with the New York Jets at Highmark Stadium.
But Allen missed on a short slant to star receiver Stefon Diggs, as Buffalo went three-and-out amid the unfavorable conditions.
Former Bills receiver John Brown recently made his return to the team and nearly had a huge play in his second game back.
The Jets seemed ready to finally take advantage after White found receiver Elijah Moore for a 24-yard gain.

     Can Greg Rousseau continue his improved second season without Von Miller?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everything was going well with that plan until Miller suffered a torn ACL, sidelining him for at least the remainder of the 2022 season.
But Miller’s arrival and subsequent success may have overshadowed the success of the second-year man opposite him in Greg Rousseau.
While not reaching the heights of future Hall of Famer Miller, Rousseau has accumulated six sacks and 27 pressures in nine games.
In his rookie year, Rousseau had a pass-rush win rate of 13.8%, which ranked 57th in the NFL among pass rushers with at least 100 pass-rush snaps.
In Miller’s absence, one would naturally assume that an issue of double teams would arise.

     'Refreshing Reset': Joe Brady embracing opportunity to coach Bills quarterbacks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Said Allen: “The way he talks to the quarterbacks, it’s very friendly and it makes you want to play for him."
That mindset and approach was steeled into Brady’s consciousness while playing at William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Va., also the alma mater of Bills coach Sean McDermott and Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin.
Brady became an overnight star in 2019 when he was hired as LSU’s passing game coordinator/receivers coach.
New Carolina Panthers coach Matt Rhule brought back Brady to the NFL as his offensive coordinator.
Some of the things he’s able to do, there aren’t many people who can.
