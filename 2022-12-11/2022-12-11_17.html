    </h2>

     Summary: “It’s primarily been bat-first, but we also think he has really good ingredients back there,” Arnold said.
“One of the things that excites us about this profile is that one, he has the athleticism, and two, we have worked with a number of these catchers in the past and had some really strong success.
That’s a credit to our staff.
Whether that’s somebody like Manny Piña, Yasmani Grandal, Omar Narváez -- guys that came in here with potentially some bat-first type of reputation were able to really improve defensively.”

     Fantasy baseball: Traded Sean Murphy, William Contreras both 2023 top-10 catchers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sean Murphy, who had the fourth-most fantasy points (295) among catchers and ranked eighth at the position on our Player Rater, was the biggest name in the three-team deal between the Atlanta Braves, Milwaukee Brewers and Oakland Athletics.
Before getting to Murphy's fantasy ranking, Contreras also enjoys a substantial ballpark bump as a result of his trade from the Braves to the Brewers.
Milwaukee's American Family Field has some of the smallest outfield dimensions in the game, and is well-known for being homer-friendly.
In fact, the move locks in what looks like a near-set top 10 at the position, with Murphy and the Contreras brothers (Willson being my No.

     Brewers Land Catcher William Contreras In Three-Team Trade With A’s, Braves
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Brett Davis/Getty Images) Getty ImagesAfter coming home empty-handed from the MLB Winter Meetings last week, the Milwaukee Brewers finally landed a catcher Monday when they acquired William Contreras in a three-team trade that also sent catcher Sean Murphy from Oakland to Atlanta and Manny Pina from the Braves to the A’s.
Had he been with the Brewers last season, he’d have led the team in batting average, slugging and OPS while ranking second in on-base percentage.
“It’s a dynamic bat,” Brewers general manager Matt Arnold said.
Ruiz, 23, was one of the four players the Brewers received from San Diego in July for closer Josh Hader.
The deal included another Milwaukee connection as Pina spent six seasons with the Brewers before signing a two-year, $8 million deal with the Braves in November 2021.

     Murphy to Braves, William Contreras to Brews in 3-team trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MILWAUKEE — (AP) — Atlanta Braves general manager Alex Anthopoulos acknowledges he paid a substantial price to acquire Sean Murphy from the Oakland Athletics in a three-team trade.
Getting players like that is hard.”The Braves added Murphy as part of a trade that sent All-Star catcher William Contreras to the Milwaukee Brewers.
Contreras had a breakout year offensively for the Braves, but his defensive skills were lacking.
Anthopoulos said he spoke with d’Arnaud before the trade to make sure he was on board with the decision.
The A’s have long traded away their key players, so the trade of Murphy is no surprise given the low-budget franchise’s tradition of seeing stars shine elsewhere.

     Fantasy Baseball: Sean Murphy traded to Braves, William Contreras to Brewers in massive catcher shakeup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Braves, Brewers and Athletics shook up the catcher market Monday with a three-team exchange that left each team with a new No.
The most notable names on the move are Sean Murphy, from Oakland to Atlanta, and William Contreras, from Atlanta to Milwaukee.
Career backup Manny Pina, 35, goes from Atlanta to Oakland, but obviously not to take over as the No.
Murphy hit .226 with a .702 OPS there compared to .272 with an .812 OPS on the road.
ConclusionWhere am I moving Murphy and Contreras, considering both player's stock has improved?
