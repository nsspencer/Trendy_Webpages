     Summary: The 49ers got the ball at the Bucs 38 after Tashaun Gipson intercepted Tom Brady.
They needed only two plays to find pay dirt.
After an incompletion, running back Christian McCaffrey took a handoff and went 38 yards untouched for a touchdown.
That was his first rushing TD of the game and second TD overall.
It’s 35-0 49ers.

     Christian McCaffrey Dominates Bucs with two scores
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christian McCaffrey , RB (SF) Dominates Bucs with two scoresMcCaffrey rushed 14 times for 119 yards and a touchdown while adding two receptions (three targets) for 34 yards and a receiving touchdown in Sunday's 35-7 rout of the Buccaneers.
The 49ers continued to monitor McCaffrey's minor knee injury during practice this week, but his status for Sunday's tilt was never really in doubt.
The 26-year-old handled a full workload and produced his first 100-yard rushing game since being traded to San Francisco at the deadline.
The 49ers might have lost another key offensive player, Deebo Samuel (ankle), to injury, so McCaffrey may be tasked with carrying the offense even more down the stretch.
Assuming that his balky knee doesn't act up on a short week, CMC could be in line for another big fantasy game in a soft matchup against the Seahawks on Thursday,

     Christian McCaffrey's big game lifts 49ers after Deebo Samuel injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christian McCaffrey started the day as one of two 49ers’ do-it-all offensive weapons.
The Niners will rely upon McCaffrey’s adaptability after Deebo Samuel, the other player capable of beating defenses as a wide receiver or a running back, went out with an ankle injury.
McCaffrey’s first touchdown of the game came with the nominal running back lined up at wide receiver.
In just three quarters of play, McCaffrey led the 49ers with 119 yards rushing on 14 carries, good for an average of 8.5 yards per rush.
His ability to play running back and wide receiver opens up Kyle Shanahan’s playbook and forces opposing defenses into difficult decisions without changing personnel.
