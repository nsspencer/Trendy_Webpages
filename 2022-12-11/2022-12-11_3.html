     Report: Tom Brady open to 'all options' entering 2023 free agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Could Tom Brady add a third stop in his legendary NFL career?
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback, who initially retired in February before returning for a 23rd NFL season, will become an unrestricted free agent in 2023.
It's been a up-and-down year for Brady, whose Bucs are 6-6 and rank 27th in the NFL in total offense.
Another playoff run could motivate Brady to return for a 24th NFL season -- in Tampa Bay or elsewhere.
Then again, Rapoport and Pelissero noted Brady is considering "all options" in 2023 -- and perhaps that wording was intentional.

     Surprising Tom Brady news has sizable impact on Buccaneers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Many people have speculated, but the surprising reports that Tom Brady is open to hitting free agency at the end of this season clearly impacts the Buccaneers.
That is why the reports that Brady is opening to hitting free agency matter so much for Tampa.
Brady hinting that he could be gone is as good a sign as any that this staff needs to start retaining players now.
Otherwise, they could wait for the offseason, lose one of their best selling points, and then lose out on Tampa being a free agent destination.
Who knows how long Tom Brady could play for?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Julio Aguilar/Getty Images)It’s not often that I’ll side with an upset Tom Brady, especially when it comes to officiating.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers took on the San Francisco 49ers this Sunday.
Early in the first half, Bucs quarterback Tom Brady appeared to be choked (accidentally, I might add) by 49ers defender Azeez Al-Shaair.
Tom Brady choked against the 49ers, gets no callTom Brady is typically the beneficiary of questionable calls on the defense, so consider me shocked and unfamiliar with the stance I’m taking.
Tampa Bay is likely to make the postseason by default, but we still haven’t seen this team play up to its full potential.

     Buccaneers' Tom Brady 'considering all options,' including free agency, for 2023, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While many assume that Brady's career would end after this season, the seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback is currently considering all options for the 2023 season that includes testing free agency, according to NFL Media.
Brady's goal entering the 2022 season was to initially retire after this season, thus completing his goal of playing until age 45, according to reports.
The Buccaneers, specifically former Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians, made it clear that trading a then-retired Brady was off the table.
Arians then stepped down as Buccaneers coach shortly after Brady's return.
Brady is also open to returning to the Buccaneers, where he signed following his first free agency foray in 2020.

     Summary: Tom Brady returns today to where his football career began.
The plan heading into the 2022 season had been to walk away at age 45, as Brady always imagined.
Brady is set to become a free agent for the second time in his career in March.
If Brady feels his best chance to win another Super Bowl is not in Tampa, it makes sense he'd look to move on for the right situation.
That was the plan before the season, but changes in Brady's personal life might have altered the landscape.

With five games left, Baltimore sits just one game behind both Buffalo and Kansas City in the AFC.
Regardless of who will be directing the offense, Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin knows his team has to try and keep them in the pocket.
Although the Steelers' playoff hopes are dwindling, they are determined to finish the season on a high note.
In addition to Jackson, offensive lineman Patrick Mekari (toe) and cornerback Daryl Worley (hamstring) were held out of Baltimore's practice.

The 45-year-old grew up a 49ers fan and is remembered by his childhood friends as a talented, competitive youngster -- something that should come as no surprise to fans of the living football legend.
"Even then, he was the most competitive kid out there," another childhood friend, Scott Cannel, told Auman.
and the most interesting thing to me was his persistence at that age," Aguirre told Auman.
"It's all the people who have supported him for 23 years," his sister, Maureen Brady, told Auman.
