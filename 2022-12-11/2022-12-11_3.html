     UFC 282 post-event facts: 18-year-old Raul Rosas Jr. etches name in record books with debut win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The UFC’s final pay-per-view of the year went down Saturday with UFC 282 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.
After an incredible run of 10 consecutive finishes to start the card, the night ended in bizarre fashion with Jan Blachowicz (29-9-1 MMA, 12-6-1 UFC) and Magomed Ankalaev (18-1-1 MMA, 9-1-1 UFC) failing to determine a new UFC light heavyweight champion.
The pair fought to a split draw in the vacant title headliner, which is a rarity in UFC history.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Darren Till is aware adjustments need to be made after suffering a third consecutive loss on Saturday at UFC 282.
“You don’t always get what you want in this life,” Till said in an Instagram reaction video after UFC 282.
Still on the right side of 30, though, Till knows there’s still time for him to turn things around.
“I just want to say to everyone there, whether you love me or hate me, I’m sorry,” Till said.
I think I’m going to have a little bit of time off from the UFC and just rethink stuff.

     Summary: Then Israel Adesanya failed in his bid to overtake the division before Blachowicz was submitted by a 40-year-old Glover Teixeira.
The fight wasn’t great, either, so that wasn’t exactly motivating for the UFC to immediately run it back.
Now we end with a makeshift title booking of Teixeira vs. Jamahal Hill for UFC 283 next month in Brazil.
What if Teixeira wins then decides to retire in his home country?
What is Hill – who is fighting on short notice – misses weight and wins the fight?

     Light heavyweight title remains vacant after draw in UFC 282
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LAS VEGAS (AP) — The light heavyweight title remained vacant Saturday night after judges awarded the main event in UFC 282 a draw so controversial that both fighters, Jan Blachowicz and Magomed Ankalaev, agreed Ankalaev should have won the belt.
Ankalaev was so upset over the decision he said through a Russian interpreter he didn’t know if he would “fight in this organization again.”“I won that fight,” Ankalaev said.
Where is my belt?”Judge Mike Bell scored the fight 48-47 for Blachowicz, Derek Cleary 48-46 for Ankalaev and Sal D’Amato 47-47.
As for the main event, Blachowicz and Ankalaev weren’t expected to be the headliners, but light heavyweight champion Jiri Prochazka dropped out because of a shoulder injury.
Second-ranked Glover Teixeira declined to fight Blachowicz, vacating the title and elevating this fight to a championship bout.

     UFC 282: Blachowicz vs. Ankalaev - Fights to make
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, is the UFC really going to give Blachowicz and Ankalaev the shaft?
The fight had big swings in momentum, it had controversy and—quite honestly—I’d be very interested in seeing it again.
If that can’t happen, then book Jan Blachowicz against Anthony Smith and book Ankalaev against Ryan Spann if Spann beats Krylov in February.
But, what the hell, I’ll go ahead and say the UFC should but Curtis vs. Dolidze.
OTHER BOUTS: Jared Gordon vs. Vinc Pichel, Alex Morono vs. Tim Means, Darren Till vs. Chris Weidman, Bryce Mitchell vs. Dan Ige, Jay Perrin vs. Aaron Phillips, Chris Daukaus vs. Tanner Boser, Edmen Shahbazyan vs. Jun Yong Park, Dalcha Lungiambula vs. Dustin Stoltzfus, Joaquin Buckley vs. Chidi Njokuani, Alexander Hernandez vs. Charles Jourdain, TJ Brown vs. Steve Garcia Jr., Erik Silva vs. Lucas Alexander, Cameron Saaiman vs. Cristian Quinonez, Steven Koslow vs. Joshua Weems

I wanna clear something up, what I said after the fight was I don’t want to fight in this city anymore because of the horrible judging, I did not say anything about I don’t wanna fight in the UFC.

     UFC 282 takeaways: Paddy Pimblett pulls off the heist of the year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With so much to discuss, let’s hit our five biggest takeaways from UFC 282.
Just six months ago Jiri Prochazka and Glover Teixeira gifted us with one of the greatest UFC title fights of all-time.
So let’s briefly touch on UFC 282’s main event, even if the UFC is apparently just going to act as if it didn’t happen.
For better or worse, he was the biggest story of UFC 282 — both during fight week and on fight night.
Shahbazyan’s second-round destruction of Dalcha Lungiambula at UFC 282 was exactly the type of tune-up fight the UFC rarely affords its prospects — and it’s easy to forget that a “prospect” is exactly what Shahbazyan remains.
