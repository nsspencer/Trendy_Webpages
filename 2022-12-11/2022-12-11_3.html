     Despite win over Jets, Bills offensive line still a major issue that’s been ignored
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The offensive line has frequently appeared in my weekly Studs and Duds columns, and not in the positive column.
The offensive line was also called for seven penalties, five of them accepted.
The mistakes by the offensive line not only put the Bills in consistent long down-to-gain situations but effectively killed more than a few drives.
All of that is just a small slice of the impact the offensive line can have on the game.
If the offensive line keeps playing like this, that’s going to be a tough ask.

     Buffalo Bills 20, New York Jets 12: Rapid recap and notes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The second meeting between the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets was another defensive war, but this time around, the Bills emerged victorious.
The weather was certainly a factor, but the Bills and the Jets ended up punting five times each.
With three minutes remaining in the half, after the tenth punt of the game, Buffalo took over at their 30 yard line.
After two carries from Zonovan “Bam” Knight, the Jets hit paydirt and tied the score at 7.
With Flacco still in the game, the Bills forced another Jets punt, which Hines was able to bring back 17 yards to midfield.

     Top 3 things we learned from Bills vs. Jets | Week 14
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Five punts marked the most in a game by the Bills this season and they all came in the first half.
The league's number one third down offense struggled to move the chains as they went 2-for-8 on conversions in the first half and went 0-for-5 in the second half.
The Bills added a second touchdown drive in the third quarter after the Jets tied the game at seven on their first possession of the second half.
The offensive line was responsible for six of the team's seven penalties in the game as the Jets' defensive front again proved formidable.
"We've got to end the game with the ball in our hands and not put that much stress on our defense."
