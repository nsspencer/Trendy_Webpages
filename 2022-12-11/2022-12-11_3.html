     Eagles 48, NY Giants 22: Big Blue overmatched, blunder-filled first half leads to blowout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What his Giants showed in Sunday's 48-22 blowout loss is that they are nowhere near that caliber of opponent at the moment.
The Eagles (12-1) had lost in their previous two trips to MetLife Stadium, including last year's 13-7 game in which Jalen Hurts was intercepted three times by Big Blue.
It's hard to imagine Hurts playing a worse game, and he did not, continuing his MVP level victory with receivers A.J.
The Giants actually got on the scoreboard after a big play on special teams when Elerson Smith blocked a punt.
Jalen Hurts off to methodical, surgical startThe Giants' secondary is undermanned, and Jalen Hurts is taking advantage.
