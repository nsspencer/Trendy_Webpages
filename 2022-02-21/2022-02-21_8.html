     The Co-Creator of Ye's Stem Player Explains Why It's a "Revolutionary Device"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But the endgame here isn’t West’s own version of a digital streaming service; nothing Ye does is ever quite that obvious.
But according to the co-creator of the Stem Player, Alex Klein, simply giving fans a fun new way to play around with music barely scratches the surface of what Kanye hopes to accomplish with it.
Made in collaboration with Klein’s company Kano, the Stem Player is supposed to represent the beginning of a seismic shift in how not just music, but content in general, is created, distributed, consumed, and enjoyed.
Before the Stem Player, Kano was most known for making easy-to-build, literally see-through computers, and now Ye’s fully embraced this ethos.
On Friday, February 18, he posted a screenshot taken from one of Kano’s company Slack channels that revealed the most up-to-date sales figures for the Stem Player in hour-by-our detail.

The product was initially released with the first Donda album already loaded up.
Also, Marilyn Manson, who was a contributor on the Donda album, worked with Kanye on the sequel project.
Overall, fans are eager to hear Kanye West's Donda 2 album and they can do so via Stem Player this evening.

     Here are the SoCal cinemas streaming Kanye West’s ‘Donda 2’ concert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fans of Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, will get a chance to see his one-night-only concert in select theaters around the U.S. on Tuesday.
That will be a relief to those who want to listen to “Donda 2" but don’t want to fork out $200 for the musician’s Stem Player listening device — the only place where his new album will live.
“Kanye West: Donda Experience Performance 2 22 22" will screen in Imax at three SoCal theaters: the AMC Century City and the TCL Chinese Theatre Hollywood, as well as the AMC Orange 30 in Orange County.
Should “Donda 2" remain available to stream only on Ye’s Stem Player, the musician will join the growing list of artists and podcasters to flee Spotify in recent weeks.
The screenings and concert follow part one of “Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy,” a new documentary that premiered on Netflix last week; it follows the rapper’s life and career.
