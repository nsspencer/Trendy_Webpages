     "It’s going to be interesting," Horschel continued.
I would think they would sort of say, Hey, we just can’t go down that route.
But, you know, we’re three or four years away from that timeline, and things can be corrected, and people can admit wrong and do things the right way going forward.
At the same time, how much does Phil actually want to be captain?
… If that’s what he really wants to be is a Ryder Cup captain, maybe there’s some way for him to sort of fix anything that has hurt him from possibly being in that spot."

     Billy Horschel: Phil Mickelson has likely tarnished legacy with Saudi comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Add Billy Horschel to the list of PGA Tour players not happy with Phil Mickelson's recently revealed comments about the Saudi Golf League.
Speaking with Golf Channel's Matt Adams on Adams' Fairways of Life Podcast, Horschel called Mickelson's controversial comments both "idiotic" and "false" while noting that Mickelson's legacy has likely been tarnished.
In that interview, Mickelson talked about overlooking the Saudis' poor human-rights record in order to gain leverage on the PGA Tour.
Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.
As nice a guy as [PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan] comes across as, unless you have leverage, he won’t do what’s right.

The old question has taken on new urgencyShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailWhat will Phil Mickelson do next?
Getty ImagesOnce, Phil Mickelson seemed to be a lock to someday become an honorary starter at the Masters (circa 2040) and, much more immediately, a Ryder Cup captain.
The legal snares tying Phil Mickelson to Greg Norman’s LIV Golf Investments are still vague, but the burden upon Phil is not.
They exploded because the man who accused the PGA Tour of “obnoxious greed” revealed his own insatiable appetite.
