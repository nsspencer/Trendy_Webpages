     Lakers News: Malik Monk Says He'd 'Love' to Return to LA in 2022 NBA Free Agency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty ImagesLos Angeles Lakers shooting guard and impending free agent Malik Monk said that he'd "love to play" for L.A. again but that it was hard to prognosticate his future plans at this time.
I’d love to play here again, man.
L.A. is notably better when Monk's hot, going 8-2 in the 10 games where he's scored 22 or more points.
Naturally, the Lakers should look to bring him back into the mix, although he'll undoubtedly have suitors after his big year.
For now, Monk will continue playing big minutes as a starter in the Lakers' lineup.

     Windhorst: LeBron James Doesn't Want to Leave LA amid Rumors Surrounding Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported James' "primary goal" is to "force the Lakers into major action" this summer by overhauling their roster.
The Lakers are in the midst of a miserable 27-31 season that features arguably the most miscast roster of James' professional career.
Eric Pincus of B/R reported that the relationship between Klutch Sports, James' agency, and Lakers management is "at its lowest point."
I don't know.
James also said he's determined to continue his career to play with his son, Bronny James, should he make the NBA.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But the rise of Malik Monk has been so fun to watch with the Lakers.
After coming over to Los Angeles from Charlotte, Monk is averaging career-highs in almost every offensive category.
And he works for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Monk was signed to a low $1.78 million contract this offseason to be a Lakers depth option.
He has since emerged as a reliable starter for Los Angeles when called upon, and his presence has really helped negate the struggle with Russell Westbrook at times.

     And that grim rundown doesn’t even take into account the apparent discord brewing between jostling factions within the organization.
James has now endured two consecutive putrid seasons with a lifeless supporting cast, so some frustration is certainly in order.
https://t.co/QaHTlBAbJn — LeBron James (@KingJames) February 17, 2022Since he left Cleveland for the first time 12 years ago, James’s teams have traded their first-round picks with regularity.
The only two first-rounders LeBron has shared the court with in that span are Norris Cole and Moritz Wagner, who both stink.
The uncertainty that’s animating this Klutch-Lakers beef is that James will be a free agent after next season.

     The Los Angeles Lakers are in an intriguing situation because, before the season, everyone felt this squad had a chance to win an NBA championship.
It’s been difficult to get a read on this Lakers team through the first 60 games of the season.
Let’s look at some of the reasons why the Lakers are both contenders and pretenders as the season progresses.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s Nov. 10, 2021, and there are five seconds remaining on the shot clock for the Lakers , who lead the Miami Heat by one point with 2:23 left in overtime.
Russell Westbrook inbounds the ball to Malik Monk , who catches the pass at the edge of the Lakers’ center-court logo.
Monk quickly veers toward the left of the basket, creating just enough separation from his defender, Tyler Herro, and avoiding a double-team from a rotating P.J.
Tucker.Monk gathers himself, leaps forward and fades to his left, swishing a ridiculously tough shot in front of the Heat’s bench as the shot-clock buzzer sounds.
The clutch performance resulted in Monk’s second postgame media appearance, a duty typically reserved for the star trio of James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook.“I had this role a couple of times in Charlotte, when a lot of guys got hurt,” Monk said after the game.

     Lakers Chances of Making the Playoffs Takes a Huge Dip After Losing Anthony Davis

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     With a 27-31 record, Los Angeles has just 24 games left to try and get things figured out.
According to FiveThirtyEight's projection system, the Lakers have roughly a 20 percent chance of making the NBA playoffs.
The Lakers are still headlined by LeBron James, who continues to play out of his mind.
Bron put up 33 points against the Jazz in Los Angeles' final game before the break.
So while things do look bleak for Los Angeles, never count out LeBron James.

     Anthony Davis has found himself injured so much that the talking heads have begun swirling overhead.
Below, we rank the 5 best Anthony Davis trades.
You could suggest the Bucks second best player, Khris Middleton, is as good as the Heat’s best player, Jimmy Butler, and I wouldn’t argue.
Anthony Davis is one of the few players in the world who can match up with Giannis and Durant.
Trading Anthony Davis might be the only legitimate recourse the Lakers have to upgrade their roster.
