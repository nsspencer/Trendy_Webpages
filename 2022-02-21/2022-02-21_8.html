     Paul Farmer, Pioneer of Global Health, Dies at 62
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Paul Farmer, a physician and anthropologist who sought to bring high-quality health care to some of the world’s poorest people, died on Monday in Rwanda.
Partners in Health, the global public health organization that Dr. Farmer co-founded, announced his death in a statement that did not specify the cause.
Dr. Farmer previously lived in Rwanda and spent decades focused on improving its health care system.
Dr. Farmer gained public renown thanks largely to “Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, a Man Who Would Cure the World,” a 2003 book by Tracy Kidder.
It told Dr. Farmer’s life story and celebrated his devotion to helping the neediest.

     Dr. Paul Farmer, a giant in the field of global health, professor at Harvard Medical School and co-founder of the nonprofit Partners In Health, died Monday in Butaro, Rwanda, in a hospital he helped build.
Farmer, the subject of the 2003 book by Tracy Kidder called "Mountains Beyond Mountains," also wrote a dozen books of his own on different aspects of global health.
"This is a titanic loss for global health that will reverberate for generations to come.
Farmer, a University Professor and chairman of the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School, also pioneered the idea of "accompaniment" in medicine.
“Paul Farmer’s loss is devastating, but his vision for the world will live on through Partners in Health," Davis, of Partners In Health wrote in a statement.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dr. Paul Farmer, the renowned infectious disease specialist who devoted his life to fighting deadly epidemics and spent the last several years working on four continents delivering health care to millions, has died in Rwanda, his organization Partners in Health confirmed.
The cause of Farmer’s death was not immediately known but PIH said in a tweet that Farmer passed away unexpectedly Monday in his sleep.
“Primary beneficiaries will include two organizations with which I’ve been involved for decades, Partners In Health and the Equal Justice Initiative.
These are organizations that do not turn away from the problems associated with exclusion, and the mistrust that invariably follows exclusion.”Before COVID-19, Farmer devoted his life to fighting every major epidemic that had hit the countries where he devoted his time: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, cholera, Ebola, Zika and chikungunya and now COVID-19.
Among his many cherished accomplishments was the construction of the post-quake, state-of-the-art 200,000-square-foot University Hospital of Mirebalais that Partners In Health and Zanmi Lasante, built in Haiti.
