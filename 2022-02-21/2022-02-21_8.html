     Nikki Bella on Judging AGT: Extreme with Simon Cowell and Travis Pastrana: 'I Was Very Intimidated'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ""And then to know that I'm sharing the judging panel with Simon Cowell and Travis Pastrana, I'm not going to lie, at first I was very intimidated," she recalled.
I mean, Travis is a king of extreme, and there's no more iconic judge than Simon Cowell."
Nikki Bella Credit: Eliza Morse/NBCReflecting on the first time she met the "iconic" Cowell, Bella said she did everything she could to calm her nerves.
In October, it was revealed that Cowell, Bella and Pastrana would be judging the show, while Crews would serve as host.
Similar to the original series, AGT: Extreme will bring contestants head-to-head each week to compete for a $500,000 prize and the title of champion.
