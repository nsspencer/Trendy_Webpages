     New England college student has legs amputated after eating leftover noodles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The strange case of a New England college student who had both his legs amputated after eating leftovers is getting renewed attention thanks to a viral video.
The YouTube channel "Chubbyemu," run by Dr. Bernard Hsu, a licensed toxicologist, posted a video of the case on Feb. 16.
The 19-year-old man, identified in the YouTube video as "JC," had started feeling abdominal pain and nausea after eating rice, chicken and lo mein leftovers from a restaurant meal.
A friend with whom he had been staying took him to an emergency room where he was flown by helicopter to a hospital.

     How could eating leftover noodles lead to leg amputations?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The dangers of sepsis and bacterial infection were reported by doctors who amputated both legs and 10 fingers of a student who ate leftover noodles.
The man from New England was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston 20 hours after first feeling unwell, shortly after eating leftover rice, chicken and lo mein noodles from a local restaurant.
He was later diagnosed with neisseria meningitidis, also known as meningococcal disease, which caused his stiff neck, nausea, respiratory collapse, shock, and multiple organ failure.
Although eating leftover food is unlikely to cause as severe a reaction in most cases, bacteria can quickly grow on leftover food when it is stored at room temperature.
An existing infection triggers an extreme chain reaction throughout the body that can quickly become a life-threatening emergency.

     Teen Has Legs Amputated After Leftover Noodles Trigger Deadly Condition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The case of a 19-year-old student who developed sepsis and lost his legs as a result of eating leftover food has gone viral thanks to a YouTube video.
The rash soon spread to JC's face, chest, abdomen, back, arms and legs, only sparing his palms and the soles of his feet.
JC's skin necrosis was the result of a condition called "purpura fulminans"—a rare and severe complication of meningococcal septicemia.
The authors of the paper conclude by saying that JC recovery from his condition has been "mostly good."
With regards to leftover takeaway food, WebMD suggests not waiting until food smells to throw it out as bacteria can often not be seen or smelled.

     Russian President Vladimir Putin ups ante in crisis by recognizing Ukraine’s rebels
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian President Vladimir Putin moved quickly on Monday to recognize the independence of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, framing his show of defiance against the West in a series of nationally televised appearances that came amid Western fears of Russian invasion in Ukraine.
Immediately after the pro-Russian leaders of Ukraine’s separatist “people’s republics” were shown on Russian TV pleading with Putin to acknowledge them as independent states, Putin chaired a Kremlin meeting Monday in which a lineup of senior Russian officials all backed the move.
Hours later, Putin spoke in an hour-long televised address to the nation and then was shown on TV signing the recognition decrees.
The rebels have charged than a sharp increase in skirmishes heralded Ukraine’s intention to reclaim control of the region by force.
They followed up Monday by asking Putin to recognize their regions’ independence, setting stage for the Kremlin’s political show.

     Teen’s legs, fingers amputated after eating takeout leftovers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     BOSTON (WJW) — A 19-year-old’s harrowing medical story — the one where eating takeout leftovers led to limb amputation — is making headlines after a recent explainer YouTube video went viral.
Following vomiting, stomach pain and purpling skin, the teen’s friend, who also had thrown up after eating the leftover restaurant meal, took JC to a nearby hospital emergency room.
Doctors reportedly chose to amputate both legs below the knees and parts of all fingers.
JC, who reportedly had all of his childhood vaccinations and was relatively healthy, was diagnosed with purpura fulminans due to meningococcemia.
The patient “had a relatively good recovery,” according to the medical journal report, considering the seriousness of the sickness.

     TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — A video about a student who had to have both legs amputated after eating leftover food has recently gone viral on YouTube.
The teen, identified only as “JC” started experiencing nausea and abdominal pain after eating rice, chicken, and lo mein leftovers from a restaurant meal, the study said.
The report said the teen shared the meal with a friend, and that his friend took him to the the emergency room after his skin became discolored.
The friend who ate the same meal vomited once, but had not become progressively ill, the study said.
Parts of his fingers were amputated and both legs were amputated below the knee.

     Teenager has legs and fingers amputated after eating leftover noodles that caused potentially fatal condition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After eating leftover food in his fridge, which triggered a potentially deadly disease, a 19-year-old student had to get both of his legs and and all ten fingers amputated.
“Doctors started to notice a rash containing small spots emerging all over his body,” Hsu explained.
Similar to JC, his roommate also threw up after eating the leftover food but he didn’t react nearly as badly.
The doctors then studied JC’s medical history more to discover how he differed from his roommate.
As noted by WebMD, bacteria can quickly grow on leftover food when stored at room temperature.

     And ironically it’s from the recent recirculation on social media of a case report that first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine about a year ago in March 2021.
Note that eating leftovers from a year ago is in general a bad, bad idea.
For the case report, several Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) doctors (Pavan K. Bendapudi, M.D., Michael J. Whalen, M.D., Manuella Lahoud-Rahme, M.D., and Julian A. Villalba, M.D.)
Blood and urine tests revealed that he was infected with a bad, bad bacteria: Neisseria meningitidis.
Nonetheless, the MGH case report is a reminder that things can potentially get worse, much worse.
