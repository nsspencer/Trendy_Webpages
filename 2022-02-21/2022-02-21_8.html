     Report: Zanesville singer and AGT star Jane 'Nightbirde' Marczewski dies at 31
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Jane Marczewski, the singer from Zanesville known as "Nightbirde" who became a sensation after appearing on "America's Got Talent," lost her battle with cancer and died Sunday, TMZ is reporting.
A golden buzzer sends contestants on the NBC show straight to the competition's live show.
Marczewski had been open about her struggle with the disease, saying on AGT that while she had a 2% chance of survival, 2% wasn't 0%.
Carpenter told the Newark Advocate in June that her coworker had an infectious spirit that left an impact on whomever she met.
AGT judge Howie Mandel on Monday remembered Marczewski as a "bright inspirational light," and said "we must continue to live and learn from her words and lyrics."
