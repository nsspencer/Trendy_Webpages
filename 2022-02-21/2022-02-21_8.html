     Russian President Vladimir Putin ups ante in crisis by recognizing Ukraine’s rebels
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian President Vladimir Putin moved quickly on Monday to recognize the independence of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, framing his show of defiance against the West in a series of nationally televised appearances that came amid Western fears of Russian invasion in Ukraine.
Immediately after the pro-Russian leaders of Ukraine’s separatist “people’s republics” were shown on Russian TV pleading with Putin to acknowledge them as independent states, Putin chaired a Kremlin meeting Monday in which a lineup of senior Russian officials all backed the move.
Hours later, Putin spoke in an hour-long televised address to the nation and then was shown on TV signing the recognition decrees.
The rebels have charged than a sharp increase in skirmishes heralded Ukraine’s intention to reclaim control of the region by force.
They followed up Monday by asking Putin to recognize their regions’ independence, setting stage for the Kremlin’s political show.

     OnPolitics: What does Russian President Vladimir Putin really want?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian President Vladimir Putin Monday signed three decrees recognizing the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, two breakway regions of eastern Ukraine.
"We have anticipated a move like this from Russia and are ready to respond immediately," Psaki said.
The order is separate from promised sanctions Biden said he would impose on Moscow should Russia invade Ukraine.
Putin remains an enigma even as he takes center stage in the current conflict facing eastern Europe.
But for reasons known primarily to him, an undeterred Putin seeks to lash the nations together by force.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     During his hour-long televised remarks, Putin aired historical grievances against NATO and the U.S. and accused Western governments of hostile activities that threaten Russian security.
Ahead of Putin's address, the Kremlin said that the Russian president discussed his decision with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
The announcement to recognize the so-called Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, breakaway areas in the Donbas, comes hours after Putin convened a broadcasted national security meeting.
President Biden has warned Putin that the U.S. and its allies are willing to impose swift and severe costs on Russia.
"And let us be clear: this would be an offensive war, a war of choice, planned for months in advance.

The separatists might have invited Russian forces in, but neither Ukraine nor the rest of the world views the so-called republics as anything but Ukrainian territory.
Russian state television has broadcast extensive reports claiming, without evidence, that Ukraine is preparing an offensive against the separatist territories.
Mr. Zelensky, in a televised statement, urged Ukraine’s allies to take action immediately and called for the Ukrainian people to remain calm.
“We are not afraid of anything or anyone.”After the speech, Mr. Zelensky spoke to President Biden and called a meeting of his Security and Defense Council.

     Putin orders 'peacekeeping' troops to Ukraine after recognizing breakaway regionsEnlarge this image toggle caption Alexey Nikolsky/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images Alexey Nikolsky/Sputnik/AFP via Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized two regions in Ukraine as independent and ordered Russian troops to conduct "peacekeeping" operations there, raising fears that Russia is paving the way for an attack.
This move also could allow the Russian-backed separatists who run the regions to invite in Russian troops.
The German chancellor also urged Putin to pull Russian troops from the Ukraine-Russia border to de-escalate tensions.
Putin has said that Ukraine is committing a "genocide" there and that he could send in troops to supposedly save its people.
"Russian troops moving into the Donbas would not itself be a new step.

     Putin orders troops into pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered troops into separatist-held parts of eastern Ukraine in what the Kremlin called a "peacekeeping" mission, just hours after he signed decrees recognizing the independence of the Moscow-backed regions.
"Ukraine has never had traditions of its own statehood," he said, calling the eastern part of the country "ancient Russian lands."
The decrees signed by Putin conveyed Moscow's official recognition over two breakaway territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine -- the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic (DPR and LPR).
The decrees recognized them as independent states and guaranteed their security with Russian troops.
The increase in combative language from Putin came as tensions grew once again in eastern Ukraine.
