     And ironically it’s from the recent recirculation on social media of a case report that first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine about a year ago in March 2021.
Note that eating leftovers from a year ago is in general a bad, bad idea.
For the case report, several Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) doctors (Pavan K. Bendapudi, M.D., Michael J. Whalen, M.D., Manuella Lahoud-Rahme, M.D., and Julian A. Villalba, M.D.)
Blood and urine tests revealed that he was infected with a bad, bad bacteria: Neisseria meningitidis.
Nonetheless, the MGH case report is a reminder that things can potentially get worse, much worse.
