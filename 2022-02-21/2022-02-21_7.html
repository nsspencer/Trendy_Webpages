     Teen’s legs, fingers amputated after eating takeout leftovers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     BOSTON (WJW) — A 19-year-old’s harrowing medical story — the one where eating takeout leftovers led to limb amputation — is making headlines after a recent explainer YouTube video went viral.
Following vomiting, stomach pain and purpling skin, the teen’s friend, who also had thrown up after eating the leftover restaurant meal, took JC to a nearby hospital emergency room.
Doctors reportedly chose to amputate both legs below the knees and parts of all fingers.
JC, who reportedly had all of his childhood vaccinations and was relatively healthy, was diagnosed with purpura fulminans due to meningococcemia.
The patient “had a relatively good recovery,” according to the medical journal report, considering the seriousness of the sickness.

     NEW ENGLAND (WTVO) — A 19-year-old New England student had both legs and parts of his fingers amputated after developing sepsis after eating a friend’s leftover noodles.
According to WFLA, the student, identified as “JC” in a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine, began experiencing nausea and abdominal pain after eating rice, chicken, and lo mein noodles leftover from a restaurant meal.
The teen was taken to the emergency room by his friend after his skin became discolored.
Doctors tested his blood and discovered Neisseria meningitidis, a sometimes fatal form of sepsis, which caused his blood to clot.
Physicians cut off both of the teen’s legs below the knee, as well as part of his fingers.

     The strange case of a New England college student who had both his legs amputated after eating leftovers is getting renewed attention thanks to a viral video.
The YouTube channel "Chubbyemu," run by Dr. Bernard Hsu, a licensed toxicologist, posted a video of the case on Feb. 16.
The 19-year-old man, identified in the YouTube video as "JC," had started feeling abdominal pain and nausea after eating rice, chicken, and lo mein leftovers from a restaurant meal.
The friend said he had eaten the same meal and vomited but did not become progressively ill.

     Teen Has Legs Amputated After Leftover Noodles Trigger Deadly Condition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The case of a 19-year-old student who developed sepsis and lost his legs as a result of eating leftover food has gone viral thanks to a YouTube video.
The rash soon spread to JC's face, chest, abdomen, back, arms and legs, only sparing his palms and the soles of his feet.
JC's skin necrosis was the result of a condition called "purpura fulminans"—a rare and severe complication of meningococcal septicemia.
The authors of the paper conclude by saying that JC recovery from his condition has been "mostly good."
With regards to leftover takeaway food, WebMD suggests not waiting until food smells to throw it out as bacteria can often not be seen or smelled.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After eating leftover food from his fridge, which triggered a potentially deadly disease, a 19-year-old student had to get both of his legs and all ten fingers amputated.
“Doctors started to notice a rash containing small spots emerging all over his body,” Hsu explained.
Similar to JC, his roommate also threw up after eating the leftover food but he didn’t react nearly as badly.
The doctors then studied JC’s medical history more to discover how he differed from his roommate.
As noted by WebMD, bacteria can quickly grow on leftover food when stored at room temperature.

     And ironically it’s from the recent recirculation on social media of a case report that first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine about a year ago in March 2021.
Note that eating leftovers from a year ago is in general a bad, bad idea.
For the case report, several Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) doctors (Pavan K. Bendapudi, M.D., Michael J. Whalen, M.D., Manuella Lahoud-Rahme, M.D., and Julian A. Villalba, M.D.)
Blood and urine tests revealed that he was infected with a bad, bad bacteria: Neisseria meningitidis.
Nonetheless, the MGH case report is a reminder that things can potentially get worse, much worse.
