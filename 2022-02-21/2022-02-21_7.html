     James Gunn And Peacemaker’s Jennifer Holland Announce Engagement And Her Diamond Is The Size Of An Infinity Stone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James Gunn has been keeping pretty busy since becoming a major player in Hollywood upon the release of his Guardians of the Galaxy almost a decade ago.
Apparently he manages, though, because his engagement to Peacemaker’s Jennifer Holland was just announced, and the newly engaged couple look positively radiant about the news.
James Gunn’s Instagram is typically full of superheroes, behind the scenes shots or promo photos for one of his projects, and the occasional cat pic.
In his most recent post, though, Jennifer Holland is front and center, with her new engagement ring on full display.
Karen Gillian, who has worked with James Gunn on the Guardians of the Galaxy films, has also commented her congratulations.

     James Gunn Explains Peacemaker's Commentary on Current Events
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James Gunn explores the relationship between Peacemaker and the "manipulations" of the government that's pulling Christopher Smith's strings.
Peacemaker creator James Gunn addressed the relationship between the DC Extended Universe show and current events, and how it differs from the attitude in The Suicide Squad.
Definitely in Suicide Squad, that’s a prominent thing we get into, our relationship with a government that's using us.
Gunn isn't afraid to draw on characters from the DC Extended Universe when needed, as seen in the Peacemaker Season 1 finale when members of the Justice League arrived late to the final battle.
