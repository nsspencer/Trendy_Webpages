     Dr. Paul Farmer, who devoted his life to fighting deadly epidemics, has died. He was 62

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dr. Paul Farmer, the renowned infectious disease specialist who devoted his life to fighting deadly epidemics and spent the last several years working on four continents delivering health care to millions, has died in Rwanda, his organization Partners in Health confirmed.
The cause of Farmer’s death was not immediately known but PIH said in a tweet that Farmer passed away unexpectedly Monday in his sleep.
“Primary beneficiaries will include two organizations with which I’ve been involved for decades, Partners In Health and the Equal Justice Initiative.
These are organizations that do not turn away from the problems associated with exclusion, and the mistrust that invariably follows exclusion.”Before COVID-19, Farmer devoted his life to fighting every major epidemic that had hit the countries where he devoted his time: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, cholera, Ebola, Zika and chikungunya and now COVID-19.
Among his many cherished accomplishments was the construction of the post-quake, state-of-the-art 200,000-square-foot University Hospital of Mirebalais that Partners In Health and Zanmi Lasante, built in Haiti.
