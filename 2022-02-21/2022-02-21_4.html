Rory McIlroy has slammed Phil Mickelson for his comments regarding the proposed Golf Super League.
Mickelson took aim at the PGA Tour for “obnoxious greed” and explained why he would be open to competing in a breakaway league, despite Saudi Arabia's questionable human rights record and inhumane LGBTQ+ laws.
The new series is set to be announced in the near future and will be a direct rival to the existing PGA Tour and DP World Tour.
The reason why such huge sums are being offered is because any golfer who does decide to join the new super league risks never being allowed to play on the PGA Tour, European Tour or in the Ryder Cup again.

Getty ImagesOnce, Phil Mickelson seemed to be a lock to someday become an honorary starter at the Masters (circa 2040) and, much more immediately, a Ryder Cup captain.
The legal snares tying Phil Mickelson to Greg Norman’s LIV Golf Investments are still vague, but the burden upon Phil is not.
They exploded because the man who accused the PGA Tour of “obnoxious greed” revealed his own insatiable appetite.
