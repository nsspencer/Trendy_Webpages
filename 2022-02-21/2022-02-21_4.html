     Courteney Cox has shared details of the moment she realised cosmetic injections were making her look “really strange”.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Style magazine, the 57-year-old actor recalled why she tried to “chase [youthfulness]” for years.
I’m looking older.’ And I tried to chase that [youthfulness] for years,” Cox, who played the role of Monica Geller in US sitcom Friends, said.
Because people would talk about me, I think,” Cox said.
“I think she’s funny, and I love hanging out with her,” Cox explained.

And I didn't realise that, oh s***, I'm actually looking really strange with injections and doing stuff to my face that I would never do now."
Lisa's laugh alone is the most infectious laugh I've ever heard.
