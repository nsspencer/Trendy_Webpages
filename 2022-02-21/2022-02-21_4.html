     What’s being said nationally about Juwan Howard-Wisconsin fracas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A squabble in the postgame handshake line between Michigan head coach Juwan Howard and Wisconsin head coach Greg Gard quickly escalated and led to a scuffle on the court.
Howard’s actions drew the most attention nationally as he hit a Badgers assistant coach.
Here’s what’s being said nationally about Sunday’s fracas.
“If you dont want a team calling a timeout, dont press them when the game is over.
But a lengthy suspension absolutely seems fair.”“Terrible press conference for Juwan Howard,” 247Sports’ Zach Shaw tweeted.

     National media weighs in on Juwan Howard incident vs. Wisconsin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Now that the dust has settled a bit and we’ve Zapruder’d the film of the melee in Madison from multiple angles, everyone’s got an opinion on what happened on Sunday afternoon, who was right and who was wrong.
There are multiple schools of thought now: the prevailing one being Juwan Howard was very much in the wrong for striking a Wisconsin assistant coach, both others recognize that there was unique provocation.
Then there’s all the banter about the initial instigation, whether it be the Michigan press or the Wisconsin timeout.
With that in mind, here are the myriad reactions to Juwan Howard’s actions on Sunday at the Kohl Center.

     Juwan Howard incident offers a simple reminder to everyone in college sports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Why mention the fact that Howard played for championships in college and won an NBA title in the pros?
It might seem irrelevant to the discussion, but it underscores the point that Howard does know what championship poise requires.
It happened with Maryland at last year’s Big Ten Tournament:This was strike one for Juwan Howard last year.
Howard can only control what he can control: How he behaves, and how he coaches his own team.
Juwan Howard has surely communicated that truth to NBA and college players many times over the years.

     MADISON, WISCONSIN - FEBRUARY 20: Wisconsin Badgers Assistant Coach Joe Krabbenhoft reacts after a fight breaks out between Wisconsin Badgers and Michigan Wolverines.
Joe Krabbenhoft was hit in the head by Michigan Wolverines Head Coach Juwan Howard at Kohl Center on February 20, 2022 in Madison, Wisconsin.
Unfortunately, that’s all overshadowed by the immature actions of Michigan head coach Juwan Howard.
The incident stemmed from a timeout Badgers’ head coach Greg Gard called near the end of the game.
The Wisconsin Basketball program should seek severe punishment for Michigan Wolverines’ head coach Juwan Howard following Sunday’s incident.

     The sports world is buzzing with reaction to the postgame fight involving Michigan and Wisconsin on Sunday.
So, based off what we know as of Monday morning, what should Howard's punishment be?
David Cobb: Howard deserves more than Gard's punishmentThree games, five games, 10 games.
But as for the two-most visible participants — Howard and Gard — proportion seems like the most important element.
Whatever punishment Howard gets, Gard's should be considerably less.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     He starts with the least offensive issues — the decisions by Juwan Howard to press late and Greg Gard to call a late timeout — and goes from there.
"I get why Juwan Howard was angry," Williams said.
You heard Juwan Howard say, 'Don't grab me, do not touch me.'
"Juwan Howard should not worry about Greg Gard calling timeout and Greg Gard shouldn't worry about Juwan Howard pressing," Greenberg said.
Juwan Howard didn't want to deal with Greg Gard.
