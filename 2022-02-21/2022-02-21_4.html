    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sam Hunt and his wife Hannah Lee Fowler are reportedly expecting their first child.
Hunt and Fowler have never publicly revealed that they were expecting their first child together, however, the legal documents state that the “23” singer’s wife is due in May 2022.
In the documents, which were filed in the no-fault divorce state of Tennessee, Fowler asks for alimony, primary custody of their soon-to-be born child, as well as child support.
And I’m hoping that we’ll have some good news sooner than later,” Hunt told the outlet at the time.
Hunt tried to win Fowler back for countless months and he was eventually successful.
