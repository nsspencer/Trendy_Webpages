     Syracuse men's basketball will look for its sixth win in seven games when Georgia Tech comes to the Carrier Dome on Monday.
The Yellow Jackets (11-15, 4-11) are coming off a 68-62 win at Pittsburgh on Saturday -- a result that snapped a three-game losing streak.
"He’s been pretty good in practice," Boeheim said of Sidibe.
How Sidibe's body handles the workload against Boston College will be worth monitoring on Monday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)With five games remaining, Syracuse Basketball will face a tough road to make it to both the ACC Tournament and NCAA Tournament.
So, what is Syracuse planning to do to make it to not only the ACC Tournament but the NCAA Tournament altogether?
Win the remaining games on the schedule and might have to win the ACC Tournament altogether to get to the NCAA Tournament.
They will need to at least make either the semi-final or final to make it possible for an NCAA Tournament spot.
If the Orange pick up wins against Notre Dame, Duke, Miami, and North Carolina, they will most likely have a shot at the NCAA Tournament.

     Syracuse 74, Georgia Tech 73 (OT): Syracuse wins overtime thriller in dramatic fashion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SYRACUSE, N.Y. — The Syracuse Orange men's basketball team clinched their fifth straight home victory Monday night inside the Dome in dramatic fashion, defeating the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in overtime 74-73.
Coming out of the timeout, Boeheim subbed out Anselem and turned to Bourama Sidibe to step up and play important minutes.
Although Georgia Tech after the first 8 minutes of the contest shot 7-14 from the field with 15 points, Syracuse slowly began to find their rhythm with some gritty hustle plays.
Following another Syracuse timeout, their defense forced a shot clock violation to get the ball back with 15.6 seconds remaining.
However, after an extended official’s review of the play, the Yellow Jackets got possession of the ball.
