     Report: Texans Still Have Big Asking Price For Deshaun Watson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Houston Texans reportedly aren’t backing down on their asking price for quarterback Deshaun Watson.
Per The Athletic‘s Jeff Howe, the Texans “don’t plan to lessen their asking price [for Deshaun Watson], which has been five to seven assets, including three first-round picks.”I don't know when Deshaun Watson's plethora of legal issues will be resolved.
Months later, the three-time Pro Bowler legal issues are still dragging on.
A special hearing has been scheduled for Watson on Monday to attempt to delay his deposition, according to ABC13 in Houston.
Deshaun Watson has the Buccaneers and Vikings on his radar for 2022, according to @JFowlerESPN.

     The clock keeps ticking for the Texans and Deshaun Watson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     At some point, the Texans and quarterback Deshaun Watson will part ways.
The Texans surely won’t want to pay that amount to someone who isn’t playing, after paying him $10 million to not play in 2021.
The Dolphins would have traded for Watson in 2021 if the 22 lawsuits had been settled.
Which teams would Watson play for?
And if potentially interested teams in which Watson would be interested begin making other arrangements, it becomes harder not easier for the Texans to get whatever they want.

     “The Watson trade, the Tunsil trade and probably a Brandin Cooks trade kind of looks inevitable right now,” Ginnitti said on Monday.
It's no secret at all that the Houston Texans are gearing up to engineer a blockbuster trade-away of quarterback Deshaun Watson.
And receiver Brandin Cooks?
Per Michael Ginnitti of Sportrac, the Texans might be expected to trade Watson (check), Tunsil and Cooks (hmm).
In fact, he termed that trio of trades to be “inevitable.”“The Watson trade, the Tunsil trade and probably a Brandin Cooks trade kind of looks inevitable right now,” Ginnitti said on Monday.

     Report: Hearing scheduled in Texans QB Deshaun Watson lawsuit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A hearing has been scheduled for Monday afternoon in the lawsuit involving Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson.
According to a report from ABC 13 [KTRK-TV] via Tony Buzbee, the attorney who represents the 22 plaintiffs who allege Watson committed sexual assault, the hearing is slated for Monday afternoon.
Rusty Hardin, the attorney who represents Watson, told ABC 13 that the special hearing will decide whether or not Watson’s deposition — which was scheduled for Feb. 24 — can be delayed until the 22 plaintiffs have been deposed.
The report indicates that as of Feb. 20, officials are not finished deposing the plaintiffs.
In addition to the lawsuit, there have been 10 complaints filed with the Houston Police Department against Watson, some of which are already covered in the lawsuit.

     Why latest developments in Deshaun Watson legal battle further delays blockbuster trade

     Deshaun Watson attorney, Rusty Hardin, was in civil court on Monday defending his client from widespread allegations of sexual misconduct from north of 20 women.
So, what does Monday’s hearing in the Deshaun Watson case mean?
Related: Ideal Deshaun Watson trade scenariosNew Deshaun Watson court developments further delays potential blockbuster tradeTrevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY SportsAs you already know, Watson requested a trade from the Texans a year ago last month.
As for teams potentially interested in a Deshaun Watson trade, it’s been noted recently that they won’t pursue a move until the quarterback’s legal issues are resolved.
Let’s assume the Harris County District Attorney Office decides not to charge Deshaun Watson criminally on April 1.

     A Deshaun Watson Update with an Eagles' Tint
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Texans want to deal Deshaun Watson by the NFL Draft but things remain complicatedAn ongoing criminal investigation is impacting Deshaun Watson’s plan to get out of Houston and back onto an NFL playing field.
The new NFL league year starts March 16 and the draft begins on April 28, the wheelhouse when it comes to the league and leverage for potential trades.
The reason for Hardin’s request can be traced to the open criminal investigation of Watson by the Houston Police Department.
In layman’s terms that means Hardin doesn’t want Watson being deposed under oath until the criminal investigation runs its course.
Dolphins owner Stephen Ross signed off on the acquisition on the condition Watson settled all of his outstanding civil complaints.
