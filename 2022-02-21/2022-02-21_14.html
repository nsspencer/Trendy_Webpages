     Marcus Morris Believes Kyrie Irving Snubbed From NBA's Top 75 List
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The NBA's Top 75 list had some infamous snubs, and Marcus Morris believes one of them was Kyrie Irving.
"How Kyrie not top 75," Marcus Morris said.
Marcus Morris isn't alone in believing that Kyrie Irving should have been in the NBA's Top 75 list, both Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala also believe so.
If Kyrie Irving, Dwight Howard, and Paul George haven't already made the list, it'll be tough to believe that they'll ever make the list.
If Kyrie Irving and Paul George potentially win a few rings, then they could most likely make the list.

     NBA fans had so many jokes about Scottie Pippen's awkward waves during NBA 75 celebration
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The NBA All-Star game was a huge hit last night and it wasn‚Äôt just because Steph Curry did ridiculous things on his way to being named MVP.
The best part of the night was when the NBA celebrated the 75th Anniversary Team by announcing the 75 best players in the league‚Äôs history.
For the players who couldn‚Äôt make it the NBA had them do weird intros with a green screen in which they waved to fans who weren‚Äôt standing around them.
Who directed the players who weren't there on where to wave?

     ‚ÄúStill tripping me out that Kyrie Irving is not on that list‚Äù: Celtics‚Äô center Robert Williams suggests that the Nets superstar was snubbed from the NBA‚Äôs 75th Anniversary Team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Just like many others, Celtics big man Robert Williams too believed Kyrie Irving was deserving of a spot on the NBA‚Äôs 75th Anniversary Team.
Just like any other list, the NBA‚Äôs 75th Anniversary Team also witnessed several prominent players being snubbed off from the honor.
Kyrie Irving was one of the biggest surprises to have been left off this prestigious list.
Boston Celtics‚Äô center Robert Williams, who shared the court with the shifty guard during his rookie year, is just one of many who thought Kai deserved a spot on the list.
Rob Williams gives his take on Kyrie Irving being excluded from the NBA‚Äôs 75th Anniversary TeamDuring the All-Star Game, as the NBA‚Äôs 75th Anniversary Team ceremony was going on, the ‚ÄúTime Lord‚Äù gave his take on Kyrie‚Äôs snub.

     The voting pool included 76 players, as there was a tie during the NBA's voting for its 75th Anniversary Team.
-- AndrewsAndy Hayt/NBAE via Getty ImagesThe unofficial titleholder for the most dominant rebounder in NBA history, Rodman led the league in the category for seven consecutive seasons.
When he averaged 14.6 rebounds in 1986-87, he became the shortest rebounding champion in NBA history in the shot-clock era (since 1954-55).
In 1969, he became the only player in NBA history to win Finals MVP on a losing team.
He played in 1,158 victories, including the playoffs, more than anyone in NBA history other than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
