     Women's Basketball Finishes Regular Season Road Schedule at Davidson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     George Washington women's basketball will hit the road for the final time during the regular season when it travels to North Carolina to face Davidson.
With just two games left in the Colonials' regular season, the team boasts the second-best scoring defense in the A-10 and a top-25 scoring defense in the NCAA (55.4 ppg allowed).
The Colonials only had five helpers against the Hawks, its fewest in a game since it had four against Davidson at the end of January.
Thanks to some timely wins, GW would have a head-to-head tiebreaker over Saint Louis and Duquesne.Wednesday will mark the second meeting this season between George Washington and Davidson.
The Buff &amp; Blue struggled from three in the contest, finishing just 1-of-17 withputting home GW's only downtown shot.
