    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Now that Simone Hicks' story has moved to college, here's how long after All American her All American: Homecoming spinoff takes place.
There isn't a specific date referenced as to when All American: Homecoming takes place, but many smaller details indicate that the show doesn't take place at the same time as All American season 4.
There are many different clues included in All American: Homecoming that point to it taking place several months after All American season 4.
The most glaring clue that All American: Homecoming takes place months after All American season 4, though, is at the beginning of episode 1.
Since All American season 4 only just showed graduation, it is quite clear that All American: Homecoming takes place much later.

     Rather, five girls are competing for the last open slot, and team captain Thea hasn’t gotten any less catty since Simone first encountered her last year.
Simone has an excellent confidant in her aunt Amara, who assures Simone that she’ll find her people at Bringston, if she gives it some time.
Plus, Simone’s still tight with Bringston sophomores Nathaniel and Keisha, who she met during her initial visit to campus.
But Damon (kinda) changes his attitude (a little bit) when he gets word that Bringston’s baseball program may get scrapped altogether.
Slight wrinkle here, though: The Lions’ first scrimmage is against Hawkins University, whose baseball team is now coached by Bringston‘s ousted leader, Leonard Shaw.
