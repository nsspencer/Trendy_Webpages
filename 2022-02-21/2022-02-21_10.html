     Celebrating Black History Month: New TV series, All American: Homecoming to spotlight diversity in tennis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     While basketball, football and many other sports suffered, tennis actually thrived for obvious reasons.
The CW's newest TV series, All American: Homecoming which debuts Monday is capitalizing on the movement, but giving its own colorful and diverse twist.
She will move from a side character to the center of the new spin-off and there will be a whole lot of tennis to look forward to.
Hicks' goal is to become a member of Bringston's tennis team and to do big things at the college level and beyond.
It's a storyline that is the first of its kind for a TV series and will undoubtedly evoke inspiration for Black girls and people of color across the board.

     The CW’s ‘All American: Homecoming’: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Real-life inspiration notwithstanding, The CW’s All American seemed to fit pretty squarely into the template of high school dramas set in ultra-posh neighborhoods.
But as a character notes a couple of episodes into its brand-new spinoff, All American: Homecoming, college is a different ballgame, honey.
All American: Homecoming The Bottom Line A warm and likable spin on the college experience.
If Homecoming, like its lead characters, still seems to be trying out this and that to see what clicks, that’s part of the charm right now.
But Homecoming seems to know what Simone doesn’t: that that very capacity for growth and change can be the core of a winning identity.
