     Courteney Cox Says Cosmetic Surgery Left Her Looking “Strange”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Courteney Cox, best known for portraying Monica Geller in Friends, has opened up about her struggle with cosmetic surgery.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Style Cox stated: “There was a time when you go, “Oh, I’m changing.
I’m looking older.” And I tried to chase that [youthfulness] for years.
Reliving the turning point, she said: “I’d say, the day you realise what your friends were talking about.
That’s just crazy.’” Now, Cox has dissolved her fillers and is opting for a more natural approach.

     (The Sun reported at the time that Perry had undergone an emergency dental procedure shortly before filming the reunion special.)
"It wasn't my intention to have a problem with it," Perry told PEOPLE in 2002 of his use of Vicodin.

When asked about Perry's remark from the reunion, Cox told The Sunday Times, "That was a lot of pressure he put on himself.
As for Cox, the Friends reunion "was fantastic to see everybody again, reminisce and realize how much fun we had," she said.

     Courteney Cox has spoken out about the pressure of fighting ageing, saying she didn't realise when she was younger that "injections and doing stuff" to her face left her looking "strange".

I'm looking older'," she said.
And I didn't realise that, oh s***, I'm actually looking really strange with injections and doing stuff to my face that I would never do now."
Lisa's laugh alone is the most infectious laugh I've ever heard.

     “Friends” legend Courteney Cox is getting very candid about her previous cosmetic procedures — and how she’s now looking forward to turning 60 in the near future.
I can’t believe it.
“There was a time when you go, ‘Oh, I’m changing.
I’m looking older.’ And I tried to chase that [youthfulness] for years,” the “Scream” actress continued.
She said, “I can obviously relate to being that age where you’re like, ‘Oh wow, I can’t believe I’m right here,’ and [asking] what makes you happy.
