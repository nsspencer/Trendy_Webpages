     And now the network is expanding that universe into a new spinoff, All American: Homecoming.
AdvertisementFor Jenrette, it was being home in Atlanta and highlighting HBCU culture that made All American: Homecoming such an interesting choice.
AdvertisementPerhaps the most exciting thing about All American: Homecoming is how unapologetically Black it is.
It’s also worth noting that while the two shows take place in the same universe, you don’t necessarily need to watch All American to enjoy All American: Homecoming; though of course, it helps.

     The “All American” universe expanded with the debut of spinoff “All American: Homecoming” on Monday night, which follows Simone (Geffri Maya) as she attempts to launch her tennis career at college in Atlanta.
At the end of Simone’s time on “All American,” she left Beverly Hills High and her boyfriend, Jordan (Michael Evans Behling), behind.
They decided to stay together and try a long-distance relationship, despite the pressures they’re both facing.
At Bringston, Simone has an instant connection with Damon (Peyton Alex Smith) — so, what does that mean for her and Jordan?
That’s what we’re really exploring with them, but again, they’re also 18 and super attractive people and life is messy.

     Why BJ Ojulari Will Make All-American Case As Junior At LSU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ojulari has been most consistent, available pass rusher for Tigers in last two seasonsSince arriving as a freshman in 2020, there has been no greater pass rush threat on a consistent basis than BJ Ojulari.
Most importantly, Ojulari has been available for all 23 games of his LSU career, something that not many on this returning 2022 roster can say.
Moving forward into 2022, the news of Gaye returning to the program will only help in Ojulari's All-American pursuit.
Ojulari's career trajectory has trended towards All-American status every step of the way, with his former coach Ed Orgeron even calling him a "future All-American" way back in the 2020 offseason before he'd taken a snap.
There's no reason why Ojulari can't have an All-American and All-SEC worthy season as a junior and set himself up in first round pick territory.

     The CW’s ‘All American: Homecoming’: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Real-life inspiration notwithstanding, The CW’s All American seemed to fit pretty squarely into the template of high school dramas set in ultra-posh neighborhoods.
But as a character notes a couple of episodes into its brand-new spinoff, All American: Homecoming, college is a different ballgame, honey.
All American: Homecoming The Bottom Line A warm and likable spin on the college experience.
If Homecoming, like its lead characters, still seems to be trying out this and that to see what clicks, that’s part of the charm right now.
But Homecoming seems to know what Simone doesn’t: that that very capacity for growth and change can be the core of a winning identity.
