     Brooklyn Nets Sign Goran Dragic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, the Brooklyn Nets are signing 14-year veteran Goran Dragic to a contract for the remainder of the season.
Just in: Goran Dragic is signing with the Brooklyn Nets, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium.
Dragic was coveted by other teams including the Dallas Mavericks and the Los Angeles Lakers, but ultimately, he decided to go out east to Brooklyn.
By signing with the Nets, Dragic reunites with his former teammate Steve Nash, who played with him in his first three seasons with the Phoenix Suns.
The Portland Trail Blazers travel to Brooklyn to face Dragic and the Nets on March 18.

     NBA Rumors: Goran Dragic to Sign with Nets After Contract Buyout from Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AP Photo/Matt SlocumVeteran guard Goran Dragic agreed to a deal with the Brooklyn Nets, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium.
Ahead of the trade deadline, the Toronto Raptors sent Dragic to the San Antonio Spurs in a deal for Thaddeus Young.
The 35-year-old made only five appearances for the Raptors, averaging 8.0 points and 1.8 assists.
In the case of Dragic, Nets fans shouldn't expect to get the player who made the 2017-18 All-Star team.
However, the Nets were getting Simmons without a clear picture of when he'd be available to play and perform at his peak.

     Goran Dragic signs with Nets: Veteran guard will pursue title in Brooklyn after buyout from Spurs, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Goran Dragic is signing with the Brooklyn Nets now that he has secured a buyout from the San Antonio Spurs, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania.
Dragic played just five games as a Raptor before leaving the team for personal reasons.
He was dealt to San Antonio on Feb. 10 (trade deadline day), but the rebuilding Spurs had no need for his services.
In Dragic, the Nets have given themselves an insurance policy against Irving's absence and Simmons' postseason problems.
No other contender could offer Dragic the minutes and touches that Brooklyn can due to Irving's unique circumstances.

     Report: Goran Dragic signing deal with Brooklyn Nets for rest of season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Goran Dragic is reportedly signing with the Brooklyn Nets, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic, ending speculation over where the free agent guard would play after having sat out much of the season while a member of the Toronto Raptors.
According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the deal will be for the rest of the current season.
Dragic left the Raptors to deal with a family matter over three months before the trade to the Spurs took place and did not return.
Heading to Brooklyn reunites Dragic and Nets head coach Steve Nash, who played together while with the Phoenix Suns.
It is not known when Dragic will make his Nets debut, though it could come against Toronto, as the Nets have a home-and-home series with the Raptors next week, playing in Brooklyn on Feb. 28 and Toronto on March 1.
