    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, the Brooklyn Nets are signing 14-year veteran Goran Dragic to a contract for the remainder of the season.
Just in: Goran Dragic is signing with the Brooklyn Nets, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium.
Dragic was coveted by other teams including the Dallas Mavericks and the Los Angeles Lakers, but ultimately, he decided to go out east to Brooklyn.
By signing with the Nets, Dragic reunites with his former teammate Steve Nash, who played with him in his first three seasons with the Phoenix Suns.
The Portland Trail Blazers travel to Brooklyn to face Dragic and the Nets on March 18.

     Getting Goran Dragic was critical for Nets’ championship hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Adding Dragic to the Nets backcourt addresses several needs.
He is no superstar, but he has played at a high level — both in the NBA and internationally — for decades.
He was a 2018 NBA All-Star and has averaged 14 points and five assists per game entering his 14th NBA season.
And he is set to play inspired basketball after landing in Toronto as part of the Kyle Lowry trade to the Miami Heat, only to be benched and dealt to the Spurs at the trade deadline.

     Goran Dragić free agency: Nets sign veteran point guard

     Free agent point guard Goran Dragić is signing a deal with the Nets, according to The Athletic’s Shams Charania.
Brooklyn will waive guard Jevon Carter to clear a roster spot for Dragić, per ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.
He then agreed to a buyout with the Raptors and entered free agency where he was sought after by several teams, per The Athletic.
Irving has been available on the road due to his vaccination status, while Durant is currently out with a sprained MCL.
He hasn't appeared in a game since Nov. 13 due to personal reasons, according to the Raptors.

     Goran Dragic signs with Nets: Veteran guard will pursue title in Brooklyn after buyout from Spurs, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Goran Dragic is signing with the Brooklyn Nets now that he has secured a buyout from the San Antonio Spurs, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania.
Dragic played just five games as a Raptor before leaving the team for personal reasons.
He was dealt to San Antonio on Feb. 10 (trade deadline day), but the rebuilding Spurs had no need for his services.
In Dragic, the Nets have given themselves an insurance policy against Irving's absence and Simmons' postseason problems.
No other contender could offer Dragic the minutes and touches that Brooklyn can due to Irving's unique circumstances.

     Nets signing Goran Dragic in free agency: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Brooklyn Nets are signing free-agent guard Goran Dragic, sources tell The Athletic.
Dragic will reunite with his former Phoenix Suns teammate and Nets coach Steve Nash in Brooklyn.
Dragic entered free agency after the San Antonio Spurs bought out his contract following his trade from the Toronto Raptors earlier this month.
The Raptors sent Dragic to San Antonio ahead of the NBA trade deadline in exchange for power forward Thaddeus Young, center Drew Eubanks and draft picks.
In five games with the Raptors, Dragic averaged eight points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists.
