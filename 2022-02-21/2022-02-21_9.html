     America’s Got Talent: Extreme Judge Nikki Bella Just Delivered Her First Golden Buzzer, And I Really Hope They Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The following contains spoilers for the America’s Got Talent: Extreme premiere.
WWE hall of famer Nikki Bella ( who recently appeared in the Royal Rumble ) awarded her first golden buzzer as an AGT judge, and I’m really hoping recipient Aaron Wheelz wins this whole competition.
Aaron Wheelz, real name Aaron Fotheringham, is a contestant unlike others seen in the America’s Got Talent: Extreme premiere.
The impact, quite frankly, looked devastating, but as America’s Got Talent: Extreme showed, that didn’t deter Aaron Wheelz.
America’s Got Talent: Extreme is only getting started over on NBC, and new episodes air on Mondays at 8:00 p.m.

     Nikki Bella on Judging AGT: Extreme with Simon Cowell and Travis Pastrana: 'I Was Very Intimidated'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ""And then to know that I'm sharing the judging panel with Simon Cowell and Travis Pastrana, I'm not going to lie, at first I was very intimidated," she recalled.
I mean, Travis is a king of extreme, and there's no more iconic judge than Simon Cowell."
Nikki Bella Credit: Eliza Morse/NBCReflecting on the first time she met the "iconic" Cowell, Bella said she did everything she could to calm her nerves.
In October, it was revealed that Cowell, Bella and Pastrana would be judging the show, while Crews would serve as host.
Similar to the original series, AGT: Extreme will bring contestants head-to-head each week to compete for a $500,000 prize and the title of champion.

     America's Got Talent: Extreme: Nikki Bella hits Golden Buzzer for wheelchair jumper Aaron Wheelz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     AdvertisementWheelchair jumper Aaron Wheelz was the lucky recipient of Nikki Bella's Golden Buzzer on Monday's series premiere of America's Got Talent: Extreme on NBC.
Aaron Wheelz, whose real name is Aaron Fotheringham was recognised by judge Travis, before attempting to wow the panel with a jaw-dropping jump.
'He's okay, he's okay!,' Terry yelled as he lifted himself off the ground, before Aaron attempted the jump for a second time.
Aaron couldn't contain his shock after earning the coveted Buzzer, with a thrilled Nikki rushing onto the stage to embrace him.
Earlier in the show, Simon also hit his Golden Buzzer for the drone group Verge Aero that flew 160 drones for an amazing light show.
