     America’s Got Talent: Extreme Judge Nikki Bella Just Delivered Her First Golden Buzzer, And I Really Hope They Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The following contains spoilers for the America’s Got Talent: Extreme premiere.
WWE hall of famer Nikki Bella ( who recently appeared in the Royal Rumble ) awarded her first golden buzzer as an AGT judge, and I’m really hoping recipient Aaron Wheelz wins this whole competition.
Aaron Wheelz, real name Aaron Fotheringham, is a contestant unlike others seen in the America’s Got Talent: Extreme premiere.
The impact, quite frankly, looked devastating, but as America’s Got Talent: Extreme showed, that didn’t deter Aaron Wheelz.
America’s Got Talent: Extreme is only getting started over on NBC, and new episodes air on Mondays at 8:00 p.m.

     Nikki Bella on Judging AGT: Extreme with Simon Cowell and Travis Pastrana: 'I Was Very Intimidated'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ""And then to know that I'm sharing the judging panel with Simon Cowell and Travis Pastrana, I'm not going to lie, at first I was very intimidated," she recalled.
I mean, Travis is a king of extreme, and there's no more iconic judge than Simon Cowell."
Nikki Bella Credit: Eliza Morse/NBCReflecting on the first time she met the "iconic" Cowell, Bella said she did everything she could to calm her nerves.
In October, it was revealed that Cowell, Bella and Pastrana would be judging the show, while Crews would serve as host.
Similar to the original series, AGT: Extreme will bring contestants head-to-head each week to compete for a $500,000 prize and the title of champion.

     Now that Simone Hicks' story has moved to college, here's how long after All American her All American: Homecoming spinoff takes place.
There isn't a specific date referenced as to when All American: Homecoming takes place, but many smaller details indicate that the show doesn't take place at the same time as All American season 4.
There are many different clues included in All American: Homecoming that point to it taking place several months after All American season 4.
The most glaring clue that All American: Homecoming takes place months after All American season 4, though, is at the beginning of episode 1.
Since All American season 4 only just showed graduation, it is quite clear that All American: Homecoming takes place much later.

     AdvertisementWheelchair jumper Aaron Wheelz was the lucky recipient of Nikki Bella's Golden Buzzer on Monday's series premiere of America's Got Talent: Extreme on NBC.
Aaron Wheelz, whose real name is Aaron Fotheringham was recognised by judge Travis, before attempting to wow the panel with a jaw-dropping jump.
'He's okay, he's okay!,' Terry yelled as he lifted himself off the ground, before Aaron attempted the jump for a second time.
Aaron couldn't contain his shock after earning the coveted Buzzer, with a thrilled Nikki rushing onto the stage to embrace him.
Earlier in the show, Simon also hit his Golden Buzzer for the drone group Verge Aero that flew 160 drones for an amazing light show.

     Rather, five girls are competing for the last open slot, and team captain Thea hasn’t gotten any less catty since Simone first encountered her last year.
Simone has an excellent confidant in her aunt Amara, who assures Simone that she’ll find her people at Bringston, if she gives it some time.
Plus, Simone’s still tight with Bringston sophomores Nathaniel and Keisha, who she met during her initial visit to campus.
But Damon (kinda) changes his attitude (a little bit) when he gets word that Bringston’s baseball program may get scrapped altogether.
Slight wrinkle here, though: The Lions’ first scrimmage is against Hawkins University, whose baseball team is now coached by Bringston‘s ousted leader, Leonard Shaw.

     The CW’s ‘All American: Homecoming’: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Real-life inspiration notwithstanding, The CW’s All American seemed to fit pretty squarely into the template of high school dramas set in ultra-posh neighborhoods.
But as a character notes a couple of episodes into its brand-new spinoff, All American: Homecoming, college is a different ballgame, honey.
All American: Homecoming The Bottom Line A warm and likable spin on the college experience.
If Homecoming, like its lead characters, still seems to be trying out this and that to see what clicks, that’s part of the charm right now.
But Homecoming seems to know what Simone doesn’t: that that very capacity for growth and change can be the core of a winning identity.

     Rather, five girls are competing for the last open slot, and team captain Thea hasn’t gotten any less catty since Simone first encountered her last year.
Simone has an excellent confidant in her aunt Amara, who assures Simone that she’ll find her people at Bringston, if she gives it some time.
Plus, Simone’s still tight with Bringston sophomores Nathaniel and Keisha, who she met during her initial visit to campus.
But Damon (kinda) changes his attitude (a little bit) when he gets word that Bringston’s baseball program may get scrapped altogether.
Slight wrinkle here, though: The Lions’ first scrimmage is against Hawkins University, whose baseball team is now coached by Bringston‘s ousted leader, Leonard Shaw.

     The CW’s ‘All American: Homecoming’: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Real-life inspiration notwithstanding, The CW’s All American seemed to fit pretty squarely into the template of high school dramas set in ultra-posh neighborhoods.
But as a character notes a couple of episodes into its brand-new spinoff, All American: Homecoming, college is a different ballgame, honey.
All American: Homecoming The Bottom Line A warm and likable spin on the college experience.
If Homecoming, like its lead characters, still seems to be trying out this and that to see what clicks, that’s part of the charm right now.
But Homecoming seems to know what Simone doesn’t: that that very capacity for growth and change can be the core of a winning identity.

     All American Season 4 Episode 8 Review: Walk This Way
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It just took a suspenseful while to get there on All American Season 4 Episode 8.
Even though the administrators knew that Spencer wasn't guilty, they had to sacrifice someone.
Not that Spencer didn't end up taking a minor hit, not being able to walk at graduation.
After all, as the cast heads off to college, school administrators will not play a significant role in the narrative.
Also, why wasn't there more of a tie-in to All American: Homecoming, explaining that Simone was taking off to Bringston?
