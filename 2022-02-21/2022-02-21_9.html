    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Portland police are asking for any information following a deadly shooting Sunday night that also left two young children injured.
It was the second mass shooting in a notably violent holiday weekend.
When they arrived, officers found a woman in a vehicle was dead from a gunshot wound, and a man and two children were injured.
The Associated Press reported Portland officers responded to six shootings in a nine-hour period between Thursday night and Friday morning as the holiday weekend began.
The violence continued Saturday night as a mass shooting at a planned demonstration against police violence in Northeast Portland’s Normandale Park left one person dead and five others injured.

     One woman dead, five others injured in shooting at Portland, Oregon park
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     One woman was killed and five others injured during a shooting Saturday night in Portland.
The Portland Police Bureau said that the woman was dead when officers arrived just after 8 p.m. at the scene near Normandale Park, a frequent hub for protests against racism and police killings.
An initial statement from Portland police said that homicide detectives were investigating the scene and that the Oregon State Medical Examiner would determine the cause and manner of the victim’s death.
Portland police said the scene of the shooting “was extremely chaotic, and a number of witnesses were uncooperative with responding officers.
Detectives believe a large number of people either witnessed what happened, or recorded the incident as it unfolded.

     Confrontation between armed protester, armed homeowner prompted Portland shooting rampage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A shooting rampage in Oregon that left a Portland woman dead and five people wounded started with a confrontation between an armed homeowner and armed protesters, police say.
"The scene was extremely chaotic, and a number of witnesses were uncooperative with responding officers," the Portland Police Bureau said in a statement.
A protest against police violence was just getting underway near the city's Normandale Park when the confrontation began, authorities said.
"We do know one thing for sure – our community is dealing with the sadness of another senseless act of gun violence," he said.
