     How to Watch Indiana's Rescheduled Game at Ohio State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Indiana and Ohio State finally get together on Monday night, two days after its originally scheduled game.
COLUMBUS, Ohio — Indiana has lost four straight games and desperately needs a win, but it won't be easy with a road game at Ohio State against the No.
The game was supposed to be played on Saturday, but it was moved back to accommodate a makeup game between Ohio State and Iowa that was snowed out last week.

Liddell as a rotating cast to defend him is going to be needed for Ohio State to win.
Coming off a loss at home, I can’t see the Ohio State basketball team losing two games in a row at the Schott.
Ohio State has too much pride to lose two games in a row at home.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Ohio State basketball team has been on the fringe of the Big Ten title hunt for weeks now but has yet to really make a move.
The Buckeyes have played a ton of close games and with a bounce here or there, or a little more smarts and effort at times, could easily be in first place in the league.
Instead, OSU sits just on the outside looking in, but close enough for their prospects of wrestling away a Big Ten championship to go either way.
Go on a run starting today and Ohio State can put itself in a good position with plenty of home games to go.
But it all starts with the game against Indiana, a team that had exposed a huge mismatch with Trayce Jackson-Davis the first time around in Bloomington.

Iowa also outrebounded Ohio State 40-31, with the Hawkeyes hauling in 20 offensive rebounds.
In that matchup, Ohio State dropped a 67-51 decision in a painfully anemic offensive performance.
