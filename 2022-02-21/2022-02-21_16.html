     James Gunn And Peacemaker’s Jennifer Holland Announce Engagement And Her Diamond Is The Size Of An Infinity Stone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James Gunn has been keeping pretty busy since becoming a major player in Hollywood upon the release of his Guardians of the Galaxy almost a decade ago.
Apparently he manages, though, because his engagement to Peacemaker’s Jennifer Holland was just announced, and the newly engaged couple look positively radiant about the news.
James Gunn’s Instagram is typically full of superheroes, behind the scenes shots or promo photos for one of his projects, and the occasional cat pic.
In his most recent post, though, Jennifer Holland is front and center, with her new engagement ring on full display.
Karen Gillian, who has worked with James Gunn on the Guardians of the Galaxy films, has also commented her congratulations.

     James Gunn and Vigilante actor Freddie Stroma explain a cut Eagly joke from the Peacemaker season 1 finale.
Gunn explains that the cut joke was from the scene when Eagly was disobeying Peacemaker and that was Vigilante's absurd idea for demonstrating dominance and getting him to listen.
Check out the exchange below:That’s #Vigilante telling #Peacemaker that he needed to be dominant over #Eagly for Eagly to listen to him (which he wasn’t doing).
