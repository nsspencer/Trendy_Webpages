     "It’s going to be interesting," Horschel continued.
I would think they would sort of say, Hey, we just can’t go down that route.
But, you know, we’re three or four years away from that timeline, and things can be corrected, and people can admit wrong and do things the right way going forward.
At the same time, how much does Phil actually want to be captain?
… If that’s what he really wants to be is a Ryder Cup captain, maybe there’s some way for him to sort of fix anything that has hurt him from possibly being in that spot."

The old question has taken on new urgencyShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailWhat will Phil Mickelson do next?
Getty ImagesOnce, Phil Mickelson seemed to be a lock to someday become an honorary starter at the Masters (circa 2040) and, much more immediately, a Ryder Cup captain.
The legal snares tying Phil Mickelson to Greg Norman’s LIV Golf Investments are still vague, but the burden upon Phil is not.
They exploded because the man who accused the PGA Tour of “obnoxious greed” revealed his own insatiable appetite.

The old question has taken on new urgencyShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailWhat will Phil Mickelson do next?
Getty ImagesOnce, Phil Mickelson seemed to be a lock to someday become an honorary starter at the Masters (circa 2040) and, much more immediately, a Ryder Cup captain.
The legal snares tying Phil Mickelson to Greg Norman’s LIV Golf Investments are still vague, but the burden upon Phil is not.
They exploded because the man who accused the PGA Tour of “obnoxious greed” revealed his own insatiable appetite.

     Why Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk Regions Are at the Center of Putin's Plan
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian President Vladimir Putin ratcheted up tensions over Ukraine by announcing he’s recognizing a pair of self-proclaimed separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.
He also said that he’ll send “peacekeeping forces” to the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, fueling U.S. and European concern that Moscow is moving to take control of land internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.

     Unmarked tanks reported in Donetsk; UK premier: Putin has ‘torn up international law’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Monday, Putin formally recognized the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR) as independent, and sent Russian troops in to “keep the peace,” Reuters reported.
He also said that the Russian people would support his efforts to take back lands that belonged to Russia from as far back as the Ottoman Empire.
Ukrainian politician Yelyzaveta “Lisa” Yasko posted a video of the tanks on Twitter, writing, “Russian social media channels spread this video of tanks in Donetsk.
God, please don’t allow this war again … Sanctions NOW!”Russian social media channels spread this video of tanks in Donetsk.
“He’s sent troops in, he’s broken international law, he’s repudiated the Minsk agreements, and torn up the understanding from Budapest in 1994 that Ukraine’s territorial integrity would be respected,” said Johnson.

The US is still seeing preparations for a potential broad invasion including loading amphibious ships and loading equipment for airborne units.
The official would not identify what line Russian troops would have to cross in Eastern Ukraine to be considered a new invasion.
"The US and NATO shamelessly turned Ukraine into a theater of potential military action against Russia," Putin said in his remarks, which ran nearly an hour.
"It will be the opening of the offensive, not a 'try and see what happens,'" the officials said.
