     Syracuse Basketball: Orange must win out for NCAA Tournament hope
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)With five games remaining, Syracuse Basketball will face a tough road to make it to both the ACC Tournament and NCAA Tournament.
So, what is Syracuse planning to do to make it to not only the ACC Tournament but the NCAA Tournament altogether?
Win the remaining games on the schedule and might have to win the ACC Tournament altogether to get to the NCAA Tournament.
They will need to at least make either the semi-final or final to make it possible for an NCAA Tournament spot.
If the Orange pick up wins against Notre Dame, Duke, Miami, and North Carolina, they will most likely have a shot at the NCAA Tournament.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Syracuse men's basketball will look for its sixth win in seven games when Georgia Tech comes to the Carrier Dome on Monday.
The Yellow Jackets (11-15, 4-11) are coming off a 68-62 win at Pittsburgh on Saturday -- a result that snapped a three-game losing streak.
"He’s been pretty good in practice," Boeheim said of Sidibe.
How Sidibe's body handles the workload against Boston College will be worth monitoring on Monday.

     That same adaptability will serve the Jackets well as they face Syracuse (14-12, 8-7 ACC) and its fabled 2-3 zone Monday.
Then again, Georgia Tech (11-15, 4-11 ACC) has already proven it doesn’t mind taking the hard way.
Enjoy the top notes from my chart as Tech and Syracuse get set to tip at the Dome (7 p.m.
ET, Georgia Tech Sports Network from Legends Sports):Rodney Howard has averaged 12.7 points and 6.7 rebounds over Tech’s last three games.
Rate That discipline could be needed against a Syracuse team that ritually forces a lot of threes in its zone.
