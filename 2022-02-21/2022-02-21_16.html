     The last four new "Arthur" episodes air this week on PBS.
The longest-running animated children’s show revolved around a kid insecure about his aardvark nose.
“In many ways, he helped us all grow up,” says "Arthur" creator Marc Brown.
Long before Arthur became a children’s television treasure, he was an aardvark with nose insecurities in a popular book series.
But in 1996, author and illustrator Marc Brown turned "Arthur" into what eventually became the longest-running animated children's TV series.

     PBS Kids show ‘Arthur’ comes to an end after 25 seasons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     TAMPA (WFLA) – The iconic children’s show “Arthur,” which airs on PBS Kids, came to an end on Monday after 25 seasons.
Screenwriter Kathy Waugh first revealed that PBS Kids planned to bring the iconic children’s series to a close during an interview on the “Finding DW” podcast over the summer.
“I think [PBS] made a mistake, and I think ‘Arthur’ should come back and I know I’m not alone in thinking they made a mistake.
It has won four Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Children’s Animated Program as well as a Peabody Award.
Re-runs of the show are available on PBS Kids and future content was teased this evening on the Arthur PBS Twitter page.
