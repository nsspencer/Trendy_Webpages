     'Arthur' comes to an end
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) "Arthur" is coming to an end on Monday after 25 seasons.
Screenwriter Kathy Waugh first revealed that PBS Kids planned to bring the iconic children's series to a close during an interview on the "Finding DW" podcast over the summer.
Executive producer Carol Greenwald said reruns will continue to be available on PBS Kids.
"Arthur is the longest-running kids animated series in history and is known for teaching kindness, empathy and inclusion through many groundbreaking moments to generations of viewers," Greenwald said in a statement.
It stars 8-year-old aardvark Arthur and his family and friends, according to PBS Kids.

     'Arthur' series finale: PBS Kids show ends this week after 25 seasons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     articleAfter 25 seasons, the PBS Kids animated show "Arthur" is coming to an end this week — and offering fans a glimpse at what the beloved characters will be like as adults.
But current fans (and potential future fans) will still be able to watch all 25 seasons of "Arthur" on PBS Kids.
The four brand-new episodes air on Monday, Feb. 21 on PBS stations and stream free on PBS KIDS, concluding the show’s 25th and final television season.
Despite not producing new episodes, PBS Kids said new content will still be available in the form of a podcast, video shorts that cover "timely and compelling topics," as well as digital games.
The animated series holds the title of the longest-running animated children's series in television history.

    </h2>

     Warning: The following contains spoilers for the series finale of “Arthur.”Art imitated life as television’s most lovable aardvark celebrated his series’ finale.
After 25 seasons, 253 episodes and seven specials, the PBS mainstay “Arthur” aired its final episode, “All Grown Up,” on Monday.
“The idea occurred to me that this whole series has been something Arthur has created,” head writer Peter K. Hirsch says.
Google “Arthur memes,” and you’ll find a treasure trove of content from viewers who grew up with the series.
Brown’s latest book, “Believe in Yourself: What We Learned From Arthur,” features the “Arthur” artwork fans have sent him over the years.
