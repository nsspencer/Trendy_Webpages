     That sounds like an auspices release launch until you do the math and realize that in the first two days it was available West only sold about 10,00 copies of Donda 2 and the Stream Players needed to play it.
Compare that to the first Donda album which in its first week of release reached No.

Even with 5 more days to complete the sales week, Donda 2 has a long way to go.
West also announced a Donda Live Experience “combining music art and fashion”engineered by fashion brand Balenciaga.

     After the release of “Donda,” multi-talented performer Kanye West has decided to release the sequel “Donda 2.”Kanye West announced in January on Instagram that the arrival of his eleventh studio album will be available on all streaming platforms, on Feb. 22.
West’s musical accolades and overall talent allow him to continue his path in the music industry.
West’s sequel album seems to be a record packed with a lot of musical diversity and new explorations.
Although mystery still surrounds the highly anticipated album, West continues to garner mass interest in every move he makes.
“ I think Kanye stays relevant because he’s not afraid to be different,” Kelley said.

     Here are the SoCal cinemas streaming Kanye West’s ‘Donda 2’ concert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fans of Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, will get a chance to see his one-night-only concert in select theaters around the U.S. on Tuesday.
That will be a relief to those who want to listen to “Donda 2" but don’t want to fork out $200 for the musician’s Stem Player listening device — the only place where his new album will live.
“Kanye West: Donda Experience Performance 2 22 22" will screen in Imax at three SoCal theaters: the AMC Century City and the TCL Chinese Theatre Hollywood, as well as the AMC Orange 30 in Orange County.
Should “Donda 2" remain available to stream only on Ye’s Stem Player, the musician will join the growing list of artists and podcasters to flee Spotify in recent weeks.
The screenings and concert follow part one of “Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy,” a new documentary that premiered on Netflix last week; it follows the rapper’s life and career.
