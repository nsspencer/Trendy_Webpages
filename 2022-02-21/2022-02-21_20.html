     Lakers: Tension Growing Between LeBron James' Agent and Front Office
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Lakers are really going to need to start preparing for life without LeBron James at some point.
The Lakers have until August to try to get a two-year deal done with James that could be worth close to $100 million.
And that tension goes back to the trade deadline after Rob Pelinka did not make a move for John Wall.
... From the Klutch point of view, the Lakers would get their client out of a bad situation in Houston and undo the Westbrook mistake."
That would mean rescuing Wall from Houston to give him actual playing time with the Lakers.

After coming over to Los Angeles from Charlotte, Monk is averaging career-highs in almost every offensive category.

Monk was signed to a low $1.78 million contract this offseason to be a Lakers depth option.

     Los Angeles Lakers Fans Should Brace for Another Blockbuster NBA Offseason
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Los Angeles Lakers added Russell Westbrook to the roster in the summer of 2021 to join LeBron James and Anthony Davis in a quest for an NBA Championship.
How different could the Los Angeles Lakers roster look next year?
THT is under contract for next season, but he’s one of the franchise’s best young players, aka best trade assets.
It might sound crazy on the surface, but it’s the Lakers’ best option if they want to completely re-tool the roster.
A Davis trade would be a shock, but it’s definitely not out of the realm of possibility.

     News Analysis: Why Lakers should take LeBron James’ subtle NBA All-Star weekend comments seriously
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LeBron James’ weekend back in Northeast Ohio exposed all kinds of truths, with the realization of just how much trouble the Lakers are in near the top of that list.
James, an expert at using both subtle and obvious ways of putting pressure on his teams to make changes, seemed to poke at the Lakers throughout his All-Star experience.
And secondarily, the pathways for the Lakers to do things differently in the upcoming offseason are still fairly limited.
Pelinka, sitting courtside Sunday during the All-Star game, couldn’t have missed what was transpiring in front of him.
But it seems clear that James won’t accept failure — and the Lakers, employers of an impatient superstar, are going to be expected to act.

     Los Angeles Lakers Fans Should Brace for Another Blockbuster NBA Offseason
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Los Angeles Lakers added Russell Westbrook to the roster in the summer of 2021 to join LeBron James and Anthony Davis in a quest for an NBA Championship.
How different could the Los Angeles Lakers roster look next year?
THT is under contract for next season, but he’s one of the franchise’s best young players, aka best trade assets.
It might sound crazy on the surface, but it’s the Lakers’ best option if they want to completely re-tool the roster.
A Davis trade would be a shock, but it’s definitely not out of the realm of possibility.

If LeBron is interested in playing with Rose again, the Lakers and Knicks could discuss the following trade in the offseason.

     Malik Monk Gets Brutally Honest About Lakers Future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There hasn’t been a lot to get excited about in regards to the 2021-22 NBA season for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Many people thought he would sign for at least a mid-level exception, but he thought Los Angeles was the best spot for him.
His value has certainly increased and he very well could have priced himself out of Los Angeles as a result.
Since Monk is hitting free agency after only one season with the Los Angeles Lakers, they only have his Non-Bird Rights.
However, no one would blame Malik Monk if he took a bigger deal this offseason from another team instead of waiting another season or two to cash in with the Los Angeles Lakers.

     The Los Angeles Lakers need to play small ball moving forward
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 31: Malik Monk #11 of the Los Angeles Lakers reacts after a play with teammate LeBron James #6 during the fourth quarter against the Portland Trail Blazers at Crypto.com Arena on December 31, 2021 in Los Angeles, California.
As the record suggests, the Lakers’ season to date has been incredibly underwhelming.
In five games as a starting lineup, the combination of LeBron James, Westbrook, Avery Bradley, Stanley Johnson, and Malik Monk has produced a 4-1 record.
Westbrook has been a world of inconsistency since arriving in Los Angeles.
But with the knowledge that this alternate starting lineup has contributed positively to date, going small is really the only way forward for the Los Angeles Lakers.

     10 things to know about the future for LeBron and the Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     That afternoon, Lakers vice president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka told reporters that he, LeBron, and Anthony Davis were “in alignment” on the inactivity.
As Windhorst has articulated, LeBron doesn’t care about past or future roster construction concerns, regardless of who’s at fault.
This is interesting perspective from @TheSteinLine: on whether LeBron James is at risk of alienating himself from the Lakers brain trust, which includes a firmly-ensconced Rob Pelinka.
Sure, the Lakers are on his timeline, but that timeline might be too short to completely overlook their future.
1) By all accounts (including reports from Windhorst and Zach Lowe on Tuesday), LeBron doesn’t want to leave the Lakers.
