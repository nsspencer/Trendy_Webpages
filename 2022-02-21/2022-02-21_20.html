     ‘Arthur’ airs final episode after 25 seasons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The beloved PBS animated show “Arthur” aired its final episode Monday after 25 seasons.
Since 1996, Arthur, his family, and friends have taught children lessons about kindness, inclusion, and empathy.
The show is the longest-running children’s animated series in the US.
But “Arthur” isn’t going away completely – PBS says reruns will still be available on PBS Kids.
New “Arthur” content – including a podcast and digital shorts – will be rolling out later this year.

     The beloved children’s TV series Arthur came to an end on Monday after 25 seasons on the air.
Last week, PBS teased a look at the future of the Arthur characters with the help of a mysterious fortune-telling game.
In the final episode, “All Grown Up,” we find out what becomes of many of the characters who inhabit Elwood City.
As he begins to read his graphic novel aloud, it becomes clear that his story starts where the show began 26 years ago.
It’s a little meta.”Check out how viewers felt about the grown-up versions of Arthur &amp; Co., as well as the response to the final episode and its big reveals.

     Syracuse men's basketball will look for its sixth win in seven games when Georgia Tech comes to the Carrier Dome on Monday.
The Yellow Jackets (11-15, 4-11) are coming off a 68-62 win at Pittsburgh on Saturday -- a result that snapped a three-game losing streak.
"He’s been pretty good in practice," Boeheim said of Sidibe.
How Sidibe's body handles the workload against Boston College will be worth monitoring on Monday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     SYRACUSE, N.Y. — The Syracuse Orange men's basketball team clinched their fifth straight home victory Monday night inside the Dome in dramatic fashion, defeating the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in overtime 74-73.
Coming out of the timeout, Boeheim subbed out Anselem and turned to Bourama Sidibe to step up and play important minutes.
Although Georgia Tech after the first 8 minutes of the contest shot 7-14 from the field with 15 points, Syracuse slowly began to find their rhythm with some gritty hustle plays.
Following another Syracuse timeout, their defense forced a shot clock violation to get the ball back with 15.6 seconds remaining.
However, after an extended official’s review of the play, the Yellow Jackets got possession of the ball.
