     LJ Cryer: Status of Baylor guard for game against Oklahoma State on Monday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     7 Baylor Bears will hit the road to face the Oklahoma State Cowboys on Monday and guard LJ Cryer is listed as questionable for the matchup with a foot injury.
Cryer ended up sitting out of Saturday’s 72-62 victory over TCU.
Cryer has been battling injuries throughout a chunk of Big 12 play and has barely been on the court in the month of February.
Through 19 games this season, he’s been an effective scoring threat for the reigning national champs with an average of 13.5 points per game.
Right now at DraftKings Sportsbook the Bears are listed as a 4.5-point favorite, whereas the opening line was set at -5.

     'I thought God had some arch on it': Isaac Likekele nearly wins it twice for OSU in OT loss vs. Baylor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     'An ideal Valentine's date':How OSU gave one couple a cherished memory with trip to Allen Fieldhouse“Next thing you know, I’m looking at the clock,” Likekele said.
Replay confirmed it, but only because of the shot clock, which was just tenths of a second ahead of the game clock.
Nearly 5 game minutes later, Baylor guard James Akinjo actually hit the winning shot, a smooth, mid-range jumper with 13.6 seconds left in overtime.
But the Cowboys fought back and took an eight-point lead, making 15 of their final 21 shots in the opening half.
OSU later got the ball back with 30.2 seconds on the clock after Flagler missed a 3.
