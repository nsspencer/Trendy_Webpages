     UNC Basketball: Louisville Game Thread
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Every game from here on out is pretty much a must-win for UNC if they want to make it into the NCAA Tournament.
The last time the Tar Heels played Louisville things got really ugly and UNC managed to escape with a win.
Hopefully tonight’s game is less chippy and has better officiating than last time out.
Things have been pretty disjointed for Hubert Davis’ squad all season with high highs proceeding some pretty terrible lows.
As always, we’ll be back after the game with a complete roundup for the happenings.

     UNC basketball: Tar Heels among 'last four out' in latest bracketology update from CBS Sports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     UNC picked up its first Quad 1 win of the season Saturday, defeating Virginia Tech on the road after suffering a Quad 4 loss at home to Pittsburgh.
It was a massive bounce back in terms of the Tar Heels’ NCAA Tournament status, as it's showing up in bracketology projections.
CBS Sports’ Jerry Palm puts the Tar Heels in the “First Four Out” section of his latest bracketology update released Monday along with Michigan, Oregon and Rutgers.
"This is who we are,” Davis said of the bounce back performance against Virginia Tech.
Getting the victory over Virginia Tech was very key, as the game at the Blue Devils is the only Quad 1 opportunity remaining.

While the Tar Heels did get the win at Louisville a few weeks ago, it very well could have gone the other way.
If UNC can bury them early, it should be a stress-free night for the Tar Heels.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     For head coach Hubert Davis and the Tar Heels, it was just another day in the 2021-22 season.
Each team punched and counterpunched throughout the evening, but it was the Tar Heels who threw the final haymaker, downing the Cardinals 70-63 to stay alive for a possible at-large bid to next month’s NCAA Tournament.
The two teams would enter halftime tied at 36-36, shooting a remarkably similar 45.5 percent (Louisville) and 45.2 percent (UNC).
The Tar Heels are now 20-8 overall and 12-5 in ACC play in Davis’ first season at the helm.
Just another week at the office for the Tar Heels.

     Love said they’ve learned from close games like Louisville, Clemson and Saturday’s win at Virginia Tech.
UNC coach Hubert Davis said he believed they played their best defensively in the last three minutes of the game.
But in the second half, Manek was largely missing offensively.
Bacot had a similar disappearing act in the second half.
He had only two shot attempts in the second half, including the dunk with 93 seconds left.
