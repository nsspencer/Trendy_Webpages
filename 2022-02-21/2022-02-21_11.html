    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The last four new "Arthur" episodes air this week on PBS.
The longest-running animated children‚Äôs show revolved around a kid insecure about his aardvark nose.
‚ÄúIn many ways, he helped us all grow up,‚Äù says "Arthur" creator Marc Brown.
Long before Arthur became a children‚Äôs television treasure, he was an aardvark with nose insecurities in a popular book series.
But in 1996, author and illustrator Marc Brown turned "Arthur" into what eventually became the longest-running animated children's TV series.

     Final "Arthur" episode airs after 25 seasons, making it the "longest-running kids animated series in history"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After 25 seasons, the beloved children's series "Arthur" aired its final episode Monday.
The decision to end the show was first reported by CBS News last summer, with a statement from executive producer Carol Greenwald.
"Arthur is the longest-running kids animated series in history and is known for teaching kindness, empathy and inclusion through many groundbreaking moments to generations of viewers," Greenwald said at the time.
The show first aired in 1996, and fans of all ages tuned in to the last episode and shared their thoughts on social media.
The show won multiple awards over the years, including four Daytime Emmys for outstanding children's animated program.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     This week, after 25 seasons, PBS aired the final episode of "Arthur," aptly entitled "All Grown Up," and TV's longest-running children's animated show came to an end.
There are several touches, callbacks, and Easter eggs in the finale that bring the series full circle.
For instance, Michael Yarmush, the original then-child actor who voiced Arthur when the series began, returned to voice him again for the final episode.
Arthur's kid sister D.W. is, predictably, a traffic cop who takes her job very seriously.
More importantly, Arthur has grown up to be a graphic novelist, and his first completed work is a memoir entitled "Arthur."

This last episode of the beloved children‚Äôs series featured a flash forward, 20 years into the future, to reveal what Arthur and his friends have been up to.
Voice actor Michael Yarmush, who originated the character back in 1996, reprised the role one last time as a 28-year-old Arthur.
(Unlike the other voice roles, Arthur and his sister D.W. were recast to always be voiced by children).
There really is an Arthur episode for everything.
