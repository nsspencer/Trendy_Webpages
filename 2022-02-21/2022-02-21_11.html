     Street Fighter 6 teaser puts Ryu and Luke at center stage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Capcom has officially announced that the next mainline entry in the Street Fighter series, Street Fighter 6, is in the works.
The game was announced at the end of the Capcom Pro Tour, Capcom’s global Street Fighter tournament series, with a very short teaser.
The latest release in the Street Fighter series, Street Fighter 5, went through five years of ups and downs, ending with a final DLC character named Luke who Capcom claims represents the future of the series.
Luke is featured in the Street Fighter 6 teaser front and center alongside the series’ poster boy, Ryu, who is shown to be moving on to his bearded “Sexy Ryu” look that was introduced as an alternate in SF5.
While the trailer gives a small glimpse at who we can expect to headline the story and a confirmation that Luke is indeed the new series protagonist as Street Fighter 5 teased, that’s really all that was shown.

     Fans have problems with the Street Fighter 6 logo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Some eagle eyed art critics have spotted something interesting about the Street Fighter 6 logo.
The logo looks very similar to a stock image found on Adobe’s stock image shop.
The new Street Fighter 6 logo is $80 on Adobe's Stock siteI don't even know what to say.
The Street Fighter 6 logo has, obviously, seen some amount of work done.
If Street Fighter 6 won’t be coming out for a good long while there’s plenty of time for Capcom to take another swing at a logo.

     Street Fighter 6 Officially Announced
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After 6 years and two updates, Capcom is finally moving on from Street Fighter 5 and has officially announced Street Fighter 6.
As teased through a countdown website, Capcom has officially announced Street Fighter 6 following the end of the Capcom Pro Tour fighting game exhibition.
LoadingThe next game in Capcom's marquis fighting game series will follow one of the most turbulent entries in the Street Fighter series.
The initial response to Street Fighter 5 was tepid, though subsequent updates like Street Fighter 5: Arcade Edition and Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition were better received.
Street Fighter x Magic: The Gathering Secret Lair Cards 9 ImagesStreet Fighter 6 will be developed without the involvement of longtime Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono, who left Capcom last year after almost 30 years with the company.

     Street Fighter 6's Logo Looks Like $80 Clipart
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     We didn’t really get to see much of Street Fighter 6 when it was revealed yesterday, but one thing we did get a look at was the game’s logo, and I did not think we could get to a point where fans are (rightly!)
questioning a new game’s logo in the absence of anything more substantial to complain about, but here we are.
And the game’s logo itself is just...a big SF?
It looks bad.
Here they are side-by-side for comparison:AdvertisementAnd if that doesn’t get the point across, here’s an overlay, with Capcom’s logo in white and the Adobe clipart in grey:AdvertisementYikes.

     Street Fighter 6's logo isn't winning fans over
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Pleasing the fighting game community is no easy task, and Street Fighter 6’s logo proves that crowd will meme questionable artistic choices into oblivion if given the opportunity.
Capcom went ahead with Street Fighter 6’s announcement Monday in a rather slick trailer.
However, Street Fighter 6’s logo quickly became the focal point of every discussion mainly because the logo looks generic and lacks that distinct vibrant flair the series does best.
Before we move on, take a moment to watch Street Fighter 6’s announcement trailer to see why fans don’t like the logo.
It doesn’t help the situation that Capcom didn’t actually show gameplay or anything beyond mentioning Street Fighter 6 is running on the RE Engine, which powers Capcom’s other titles like Resident Evil Village and Monster Hunter Rise.

     Street Fighter 6 is coming, with incredibly detailed toes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Audio player loading…At the season final of the Capcom Pro Tour, and following a week-long teaser campaign, Capcom finally announced Street Fighter 6.
This year marks the 35th anniversary of the greatest fighting game series in history (sorry Mortal Kombat fans) and six years since the release of Street Fighter 5, one of the more divisive entries after the almost universally beloved Street Fighter 4.
Street Fighter 4, the grand reboot of the series, managed this feat with aplomb, though it had the advantage of launching with Street Fighter 2's iconic roster.
I'm not sure what side of the fence Street Fighter 5 ended up on.
Capcom says more info about Street Fighter 6 is coming this summer.
