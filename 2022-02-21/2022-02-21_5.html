     Putin Calls Ukrainian Statehood a Fiction. History Suggests Otherwise.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     KYIV, Ukraine — In his speech to the Russian nation on Monday, President Vladimir V. Putin buoyed his case for codifying the cleavage of two rebel territories from Ukraine by arguing that the very idea of Ukrainian statehood was a fiction.
With a conviction of an authoritarian unburdened by historical nuance, Mr. Putin declared Ukraine an invention of the Bolshevik revolutionary leader, Vladimir Lenin, who he said had mistakenly endowed Ukraine with a sense of statehood by allowing it autonomy within the newly created Soviet state.
“Modern Ukraine was entirely and fully created by Russia, more specifically the Bolshevik, communist Russia,” Mr. Putin said.
“This process began practically immediately after the 1917 revolution, and moreover Lenin and his associates did it in the sloppiest way in relation to Russia — by dividing, tearing from her pieces of her own historical territory.”As a misreading of history, it was extreme even by the standards of Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B.
officer who has declared the Soviet Union’s collapse the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.

     Image A column of Russian armored vehicles, military trucks and supply units about 60 miles away from the border with Ukraine on Monday.
Russian state television has broadcast extensive reports claiming, without evidence, that Ukraine is preparing an offensive against the separatist territories.
Mr. Zelensky, in a televised statement, urged Ukraine’s allies to take action immediately and called for the Ukrainian people to remain calm.
White House officials said Mr. Biden would impose sanctions against people doing business in the separatist regions and that the White House would soon announce more.
Now edging toward the twilight of his political career, Mr. Putin, 69, is determined to burnish his legacy and to correct what he has long viewed as one of the greatest catastrophes of the 20th century: the disintegration of the Soviet Union.

     Russian President Vladimir Putin has received no support from members of the U.N. Security Council for his actions to bring separatists in eastern Ukraine under Moscow’s controlUNITED NATIONS -- Russian President Vladimir Putin received no support from members of the U.N. Security Council at an emergency meeting Monday night for his actions to bring separatists in eastern Ukraine under Moscow’s control.
The U.S. called his moves a pretext for a further invasion, many members condemned his violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and even close ally China urged diplomacy and a peaceful solution.
He called the Security Council “sick” for its past inaction, and urged members to defend Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Ukraine’s military said two Ukrainian soldiers were killed over the weekend, and another serviceman was wounded Monday.
Ukrainian military spokesman Pavlo Kovalchyuk insisted that Ukrainian forces weren’t returning fire.

     Vladimir Putin Has Officially Ordered Russian Troops Into Eastern Ukraine

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     DNIPRO, Ukraine — Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into eastern Ukraine Monday, authorizing an invasion that threatens a large-scale military conflict and could put thousands of lives in danger.
Ukraine’s government currently has no presence in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and it is unclear if Putin moving troops in and annexing them would be considered an invasion of Ukraine by Western allies.
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US Ambassador to the UN, derided Putin calling his troops "peacekeepers."
An invasion of Ukraine unleashes the forces of war, death and destruction on the people of Ukraine."
Ukraine's member said, “the internally recognized borders of Ukraine will remain unchangeable," and that is views Russia's moves as "violations of the sovereignty and territory of Ukraine."

     Putin orders troops into pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered troops into separatist-held parts of eastern Ukraine in what the Kremlin called a "peacekeeping" mission, just hours after he signed decrees recognizing the independence of the Moscow-backed regions.
"Ukraine has never had traditions of its own statehood," he said, calling the eastern part of the country "ancient Russian lands."
The decrees signed by Putin conveyed Moscow's official recognition over two breakaway territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine -- the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic (DPR and LPR).
Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting of the Security Council on Monday.
The increase in combative language from Putin came as tensions grow in eastern Ukraine.

(AP Photo/Denis Kaminev)MOSCOW (AP) — A long-feared Russian invasion of Ukraine appeared to be imminent Monday, if not already underway, with Russian President Vladimir Putin ordering forces into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine.
Putin’s directive came hours after he recognized the separatist regions in a rambling, fact-bending discourse on European history.
Ukrainian military spokesman Pavlo Kovalchyuk insisted that Ukrainian forces weren’t returning fire.

     Biden, Putin said to agree in principle to Ukraine summit

     KYIV, Ukraine (NewsNation Now) — President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed in principle to a summit over Ukraine, the office of French President Emmanuel Macron said Sunday, provided Russia does not invade its neighbor.
DO NOT OBSCURE LOGOA satellite image shows an overview of a new deployment, east of Valuyki, Russia February 19, 2022.
Ukraine’s joint forces said late Sunday that pro-Russian forces were shelling their own compatriots in eastern Ukraine to blame the attacks on Kyiv.
The renewed fighting in eastern Ukraine follows a build-up over several weeks of Russia troops to the north, east and south of the country.
The West estimates 150,000 or more Russian troops are currently near Ukraine’s borders.
