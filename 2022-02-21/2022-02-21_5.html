     Putin Calls Ukrainian Statehood a Fiction. History Suggests Otherwise.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     KYIV, Ukraine — In his speech to the Russian nation on Monday, President Vladimir V. Putin buoyed his case for codifying the cleavage of two rebel territories from Ukraine by arguing that the very idea of Ukrainian statehood was a fiction.
With a conviction of an authoritarian unburdened by historical nuance, Mr. Putin declared Ukraine an invention of the Bolshevik revolutionary leader, Vladimir Lenin, who he said had mistakenly endowed Ukraine with a sense of statehood by allowing it autonomy within the newly created Soviet state.
“Modern Ukraine was entirely and fully created by Russia, more specifically the Bolshevik, communist Russia,” Mr. Putin said.
“This process began practically immediately after the 1917 revolution, and moreover Lenin and his associates did it in the sloppiest way in relation to Russia — by dividing, tearing from her pieces of her own historical territory.”As a misreading of history, it was extreme even by the standards of Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B.
officer who has declared the Soviet Union’s collapse the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.

     CEPA LIVE: Putin Marches on Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognize the so-called Luhansk and Donetsk Peoples Republics as independent states is not an end but a beginning.
What is notable is the explicit rationale Putin gave to this step in his long and emotional February 21 speech: Putin considers Ukraine to be part of Russia, rather than a sovereign and independent state.
He therefore considers Ukrainian independence, complete with its own armed forces, as a military threat to Russia, as if Ukraine is an armed insurgency.
This step now becomes a new premise for further Russian military action.
This in itself would create direct return fire by Ukrainian forces, which Putin would claim as an attack.

Some context on Donbas: War broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine.
Intense fighting left portions of the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts in the hands of Russian-backed separatists.
The Minsk Agreements (named after the capital of Belarus where they were concluded) ban heavy weapons near the Line of Contact.
At the meeting on Monday, Nebenzia reiterated earlier claims that Russia was not a party to the Minsk agreement.

Russian state television has broadcast extensive reports claiming, without evidence, that Ukraine is preparing an offensive against the separatist territories.
Mr. Zelensky, in a televised statement, urged Ukraine’s allies to take action immediately and called for the Ukrainian people to remain calm.
White House officials said Mr. Biden would impose sanctions against people doing business in the separatist regions and that the White House would soon announce more.
Now edging toward the twilight of his political career, Mr. Putin, 69, is determined to burnish his legacy and to correct what he has long viewed as one of the greatest catastrophes of the 20th century: the disintegration of the Soviet Union.

The U.S. called his moves a pretext for a further invasion, many members condemned his violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and even close ally China urged diplomacy and a peaceful solution.
He called the Security Council “sick” for its past inaction, and urged members to defend Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Putin’s directive came hours after he recognized the separatist regions in a rambling, fact-bending discourse on European history.

     Vladimir Putin Has Officially Ordered Russian Troops Into Eastern Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     DNIPRO, Ukraine — Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into eastern Ukraine Monday, authorizing an invasion that threatens a large-scale military conflict and could put thousands of lives in danger.
Ukraine’s government currently has no presence in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and it is unclear if Putin moving troops in and annexing them would be considered an invasion of Ukraine by Western allies.
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US Ambassador to the UN, derided Putin calling his troops "peacekeepers."
An invasion of Ukraine unleashes the forces of war, death and destruction on the people of Ukraine."
Ukraine's member said, “the internally recognized borders of Ukraine will remain unchangeable," and that is views Russia's moves as "violations of the sovereignty and territory of Ukraine."

The U.S. has said Russia has amassed up to 190,000 troops on its border with Ukraine.
Scholz said in a statement that he told Putin that any such move would amount to a one-sided breach of the Minsk agreements and urged Putin to pull Russian troops from the Ukraine-Russia border.

     (CNN) Yet again, the world is hanging on what Russian President Vladimir Putin does next.
But again on Monday, administration officials appeared to make a distinction between eastern Ukraine and the rest of the country.
But the semantics over what constitutes an invasion does risk diminishing the action that the Russian President took on Monday.
It is well known that what Russia has described as pro-Moscow rebels in eastern Ukraine were trained by Russia and took its orders.
The US has accurately predicted Putin's move through a pre-invasion checklist in recent days that includes moves in eastern Ukraine.
