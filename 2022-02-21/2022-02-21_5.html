     “When you talk about iconic giants in the field of public health, he stands pretty much among a very, very short list of people,” said Dr. Fauci, who first met Dr. Farmer decades ago, when Dr. Farmer was a medical student.
“It’s not just about health security, in the senses of defending yourself,” he said.
It’s also about pragmatic solidarity with those in need of assistance.”Paul Edward Farmer Jr. was born on Oct. 26, 1959, in North Adams, Mass.
Paul’s mother, Ginny (Rice) Farmer, worked as a supermarket cashier, and his father, Paul Sr., was a salesman and high school math teacher.
When Paul was around 12, his father bought an old bus and fitted it with bunks, converting it into a mobile home.

     Posted Monday, February 21, 2022 5:52 pmBOSTON (AP) — Dr. Paul Farmer, a U.S. physician, humanitarian and author renowned for providing health care to millions of impoverished people worldwide and who co-founded the global nonprofit Partners in Health, has died.
“He was an important figure in the world,” Kidder said.
Kidder recalled: “Paul turned, took each of her hands in his and said, ‘For me, it is a privilege,’ in Spanish."
“It really humiliates the nay-sayers, who think it’s somehow OK for some people to get health care and others not,” Kidder said.
“Paul Farmer changed the way health care is delivered in the most impoverished places on Earth.

     With love and tears: My first and last memories of Dr. Paul FarmerEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Chandler Villaverde Courtesy of Chandler VillaverdeThe last time I saw Paul Farmer was less than a week ago.
But there he was in rural Rwanda, teaching, seeing patients and spending time with Rwandan colleagues.
A first (inspiring) encounterI first met Paul when I was 19, as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley over 20 years ago.
When health care economists or his students speak of cost effectiveness, he asks "for whom?"
A heartbreaking week – first for Paul, then for usDuring the week I spent in Rwanda, the patient that Paul was following had an unexpected complication and got sicker and sicker.

Writer Tracy Kidder profiled Farmer in his 2003 book, Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, a Man Who Would Cure the World, which later became required reading for many a student and practitioner in global health.
World leaders, global health champions, students, former colleagues and celebrities expressed their condolences on Twitter.

     Dr. Farmer was personally engaged in that medical care, at times trekking many miles to make a single house call.
She had a fever of 105 degrees and was “shaking like a leaf,” Dr. Farmer said.
His father, whom Dr. Farmer described as “not a very orthodox guy,” was a schoolteacher.
Besides his wife, survivors include three children, Catherine Farmer, Elizabeth Farmer and Sebastian Farmer; his mother; Ginny Farmer; two brothers; and three sisters.
Among his admirers, Dr. Farmer was at times described as a secular saint — a label that he resisted.
