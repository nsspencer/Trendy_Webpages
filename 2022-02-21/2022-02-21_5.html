     Tiger Woods has ‘long way to go’ in his recovery from horrific car crashTiger Woods has ‘long way to go’ in his recovery from horrific car crashRory McIlroy has criticised Phil Mickelson for his comments regarding the proposed Golf Super League.
Rory McIlroy has slammed Phil Mickelson for his comments regarding the proposed Golf Super League.
Mickelson took aim at the PGA Tour for “obnoxious greed” and explained why he would be open to competing in a breakaway league, despite Saudi Arabia's questionable human rights record and inhumane LGBTQ+ laws.
The new series is set to be announced in the near future and will be a direct rival to the existing PGA Tour and DP World Tour.
The reason why such huge sums are being offered is because any golfer who does decide to join the new super league risks never being allowed to play on the PGA Tour, European Tour or in the Ryder Cup again.

     Billy Horschel: Phil Mickelson has likely tarnished legacy with Saudi comments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Add Billy Horschel to the list of PGA Tour players not happy with Phil Mickelson's recently revealed comments about the Saudi Golf League.
Speaking with Golf Channel's Matt Adams on Adams' Fairways of Life Podcast, Horschel called Mickelson's controversial comments both "idiotic" and "false" while noting that Mickelson's legacy has likely been tarnished.
In that interview, Mickelson talked about overlooking the Saudis' poor human-rights record in order to gain leverage on the PGA Tour.
Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.
As nice a guy as [PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan] comes across as, unless you have leverage, he won’t do what’s right.

The old question has taken on new urgencyShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare by EmailWhat will Phil Mickelson do next?
Getty ImagesOnce, Phil Mickelson seemed to be a lock to someday become an honorary starter at the Masters (circa 2040) and, much more immediately, a Ryder Cup captain.
The legal snares tying Phil Mickelson to Greg Norman’s LIV Golf Investments are still vague, but the burden upon Phil is not.
They exploded because the man who accused the PGA Tour of “obnoxious greed” revealed his own insatiable appetite.

     Bryson DeChambeau, Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson comments hurt Saudi-backed super league
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But now, as Rory McIlroy pointed out, the proposed Super Golf League seems "dead in the water".
DeChambeau was thought to be the big hitter around whom the super league would be built.
But in the absence of any young stars the super league could hardly satisfy trades description legislation.
To golf's shame this Saudi super league saga has taken longer to fall apart than that putrid attempt to bring something similar to European club football last year.
Now the PGA Tour emerges stronger, as do strategic partners the European-based DP World Tour.
