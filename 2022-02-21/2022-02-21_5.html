     Putin Calls Ukrainian Statehood a Fiction. History Suggests Otherwise.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     KYIV, Ukraine — In his speech to the Russian nation on Monday, President Vladimir V. Putin buoyed his case for codifying the cleavage of two rebel territories from Ukraine by arguing that the very idea of Ukrainian statehood was a fiction.
With a conviction of an authoritarian unburdened by historical nuance, Mr. Putin declared Ukraine an invention of the Bolshevik revolutionary leader, Vladimir Lenin, who he said had mistakenly endowed Ukraine with a sense of statehood by allowing it autonomy within the newly created Soviet state.
“Modern Ukraine was entirely and fully created by Russia, more specifically the Bolshevik, communist Russia,” Mr. Putin said.
“This process began practically immediately after the 1917 revolution, and moreover Lenin and his associates did it in the sloppiest way in relation to Russia — by dividing, tearing from her pieces of her own historical territory.”As a misreading of history, it was extreme even by the standards of Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B.
officer who has declared the Soviet Union’s collapse the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.

Some context on Donbas: War broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine.
Intense fighting left portions of the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts in the hands of Russian-backed separatists.
The Minsk Agreements (named after the capital of Belarus where they were concluded) ban heavy weapons near the Line of Contact.
At the meeting on Monday, Nebenzia reiterated earlier claims that Russia was not a party to the Minsk agreement.

     CEPA LIVE: Putin Marches on Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognize the so-called Luhansk and Donetsk Peoples Republics as independent states is not an end but a beginning.
What is notable is the explicit rationale Putin gave to this step in his long and emotional February 21 speech: Putin considers Ukraine to be part of Russia, rather than a sovereign and independent state.
He therefore considers Ukrainian independence, complete with its own armed forces, as a military threat to Russia, as if Ukraine is an armed insurgency.
This step now becomes a new premise for further Russian military action.
This in itself would create direct return fire by Ukrainian forces, which Putin would claim as an attack.

She warned that Putin's ambitions reach beyond Ukraine, and that he has asserted Russia's claims to all former territory of the former Russian Empire.
The U.S. has said Russia has amassed up to 190,000 troops on its border with Ukraine.
Scholz said in a statement that he told Putin that any such move would amount to a one-sided breach of the Minsk agreements and urged Putin to pull Russian troops from the Ukraine-Russia border.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine on Monday, just hours after he formally recognized the independence of two Moscow-backed breakaway regions in the eastern part of the country.
Some Western leaders had hoped diplomatic progress in eastern Ukraine could provide a route out of the broader, monthslong crisis.
A White House official said the call lasted about 35 minutes.
“We have anticipated a move like this from Russia and are ready to respond immediately,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.
In a separate readout, the White House said Biden and the two European leaders "discussed how they will continue to coordinate their response on next steps."

     The Kremlin decree signed by Putin did not specify whether or when Russian troops would enter Ukrainian territory.
Putin's moves further inflamed tensions with the West amid fears of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.
But, the official said, “Russian troops moving into Donbas by itself would not be a new step” because Russian forces have been in the region for eight years.
It's unclear whether or when Russian troops might move into those areas.

     Snapshot from the video:Putin announced his decision to recognize Russian-occupied Donbas as independent in his evening address to Russian people.
During the meeting, members of the NSDC were persuading Putin to openly recognize the Russian proxy republics in Donbas.
However, it appears that the meeting was pre-recorded, taking place before relevant appeals by leaders of L/DNR were made.
Notably, Russian didn't officially annex the territories but declared their independence, although Russian troops are permanently stationed there.
Putin's decree presents the decision to enter troops to Donbas as a "function of maintaining peace:"Ukraine needs independent journalism.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     In his speech, Putin appeared to threaten Kyiv with a broader war if Ukrainian forces didn’t immediately stand down.
Late Monday, the United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on the Ukraine crisis, following a request by Kyiv citing Russia’s decision to recognize the separatist regions.
Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized the West and referred to Ukraine as “a colony” in a televised address on Feb. 21.
The move breaches a 2015 Minsk peace agreement that was supposed to restore the two separatist regions to Ukraine’s control, but that deal was vaguely worded and never fully implemented.
If Russian troops pushed deeper into those parts of the regions held by Ukraine, the Ukrainian army would resist, Rumer said.

     Why a Putin summit would be a huge risk for Biden
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The extreme distrust shared by all parties to the conflict -- Russia, Ukraine and Western allies -- means this diplomatic breakthrough will hang by a thread.
If a meeting with Putin fails and an invasion follows regardless, Biden will open himself up to charges of weakness.
And he has some potential cover: If Putin backtracks and a summit doesn't happen, he will let Biden off a political hook.
"We believe President Putin has made the decision, but until the tanks are actually rolling and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President Putin from carrying this forward," Blinken told CNN's Dana Bash.
As well as shouldering a big political risk, Biden will brave treacherous geopolitical ground if he meets Putin.
