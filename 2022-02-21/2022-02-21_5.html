     “When you talk about iconic giants in the field of public health, he stands pretty much among a very, very short list of people,” said Dr. Fauci, who first met Dr. Farmer decades ago, when Dr. Farmer was a medical student.
“It’s not just about health security, in the senses of defending yourself,” he said.
It’s also about pragmatic solidarity with those in need of assistance.”Paul Edward Farmer Jr. was born on Oct. 26, 1959, in North Adams, Mass.
Paul’s mother, Ginny (Rice) Farmer, worked as a supermarket cashier, and his father, Paul Sr., was a salesman and high school math teacher.
When Paul was around 12, his father bought an old bus and fitted it with bunks, converting it into a mobile home.

     That is one of scores of tributes pouring in today from global health experts around the world mourning the sudden death of Dr. Paul Farmer.
Farmer was an infectious disease specialist at Harvard Medical School and founded the charity Partners in Health.
NURITH AIZENMAN, BYLINE: Dr. Joe Rhatigan of Harvard Medical School first met Paul Farmer in the early 1990s, when the two of them were both medical residents.
You know, he really forced us to reckon with, you know, the disparities in health in the world.
Over the years, Farmer proved enormously successful in spreading the word about his ideas, raising money and essentially starting a whole field of global health equity.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When I found out this morning that Paul Farmer had died, I thought first of his wife, Didi, and their three children.
And then I thought of all the people who know and care about global health because of Paul, far too many to count.
We were there to visit a health clinic run by Partners in Health, the incredible organization that Paul co-founded (and that our foundation is proud to support).
His ability to inspire was one of the reasons that, when Melinda and I went back to visit Paul in Haiti in 2014, we brought our children with us.
There will never be another Paul Farmer.

     Euphoria star Maude Apatow has revealed that she’s had some tough experiences with acne while filming the show.
“When I started working and wearing more makeup, my skin got a lot worse,” she said.
“So I needed to come up with a routine.”As she’s been playing Lexi Howard in Euphoria, Apatow recalled one particular incident when her acne was very difficult to manage.
Then I learned that if I pop zits, they travel.”And on the set of Euphoria, Apatow knows that makeup is a major component of the show.
Story continues“They sent us so much makeup for Season 2 because the makeup was such a big part of season one,” she said.

     With love and tears: My first and last memories of Dr. Paul FarmerEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Chandler Villaverde Courtesy of Chandler VillaverdeThe last time I saw Paul Farmer was less than a week ago.
But there he was in rural Rwanda, teaching, seeing patients and spending time with Rwandan colleagues.
A first (inspiring) encounterI first met Paul when I was 19, as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley over 20 years ago.
When health care economists or his students speak of cost effectiveness, he asks "for whom?"
A heartbreaking week – first for Paul, then for usDuring the week I spent in Rwanda, the patient that Paul was following had an unexpected complication and got sicker and sicker.

     Paul Farmer, a giant of public health, dies at 62
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Dr. Farmer was personally engaged in that medical care, at times trekking many miles to make a single house call.
She had a fever of 105 degrees and was “shaking like a leaf,” Dr. Farmer said.
His father, whom Dr. Farmer described as “not a very orthodox guy,” was a schoolteacher.
Besides his wife, survivors include three children, Catherine Farmer, Elizabeth Farmer and Sebastian Farmer; his mother; Ginny Farmer; two brothers; and three sisters.
Among his admirers, Dr. Farmer was at times described as a secular saint — a label that he resisted.
