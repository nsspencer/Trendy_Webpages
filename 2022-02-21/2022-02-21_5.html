     Maude Apatow reveals battle with ‘bad’ acne while making ‘Euphoria’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “I was shooting ‘Euphoria’ a couple months ago and I got three gigantic zits on my forehead — you couldn’t cover them, they were so big.
“The one big thing I learned … is making sure all your makeup comes off at the end of the day,” she said.
VogueThe actress, who’s the eldest daughter of Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann, also makes it a point to avoid picking any blemishes.
Then, she’s ready for makeup, which has become a key component of the “Euphoria” aesthetic.
“They sent us so much makeup for Season 2 because the makeup was such a big part of Season 1,” Apatow said, adding, “We called the makeup trailer Sephoria.”

Maude Apatow, Angus Cloud Maude Apatow, Angus Cloud | Credit: Eddy Chen/HBOWhile Euphoria has no shortage of tense moments and dramatic relationships, "Fexi" is one of the more celebrated partnerships on the show.
I can't even describe how crazy it is to go on Instagram and people have made the most like incredible drawings of us, and these dramatic edits of our love," Apatow told EW.
Euphoria was renewed for a third season, and Apatow told EW she hopes Fexi continues to get more airtime.
He's so present and talented, and yeah, I just love working with him, so I totally would love to keep working with him."

     What was it like to have this play become her focus this season and to really put on a full production?
Lexi’s really smart and hard-working, and I think she’s also very controlling.
What do you think Maddie learns from her?
DEMIE: I think Maddie just finally feels like she has a female mentor in someone who’s older than her.
But I play Cassie, so I can’t judge her too harshly.
