Source: The AthleticThe Los Angeles Lakers have been accused of not making good deals during the offseason.
But one free-agent signing who has actually been a massive bright spot for them has been Malik Monk.
The Lakers signed Malik Monk in free agency, signing him to a 1-year minimum contract after he left the Charlotte Hornets.

     Windhorst: LeBron James Doesn't Want to Leave LA amid Rumors Surrounding Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported James' "primary goal" is to "force the Lakers into major action" this summer by overhauling their roster.
The Lakers are in the midst of a miserable 27-31 season that features arguably the most miscast roster of James' professional career.
Eric Pincus of B/R reported that the relationship between Klutch Sports, James' agency, and Lakers management is "at its lowest point."
I don't know.
James also said he's determined to continue his career to play with his son, Bronny James, should he make the NBA.

     Lakers: Malik Monk Sounds Like He Wants to Stay in Los Angeles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     But the rise of Malik Monk has been so fun to watch with the Lakers.
After coming over to Los Angeles from Charlotte, Monk is averaging career-highs in almost every offensive category.
And he works for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Monk was signed to a low $1.78 million contract this offseason to be a Lakers depth option.
He has since emerged as a reliable starter for Los Angeles when called upon, and his presence has really helped negate the struggle with Russell Westbrook at times.

     Early Look At Lakers’ Options To Re-Shape Roster Around LeBron

     In 2020, the Los Angeles Lakers won their 17th championship in franchise history in the NBA Bubble, tying their arch-rivals in the Boston Celtics for the most in NBA history.
In their efforts to repeat as champions, last season ended in disappointment, as the Lakers battled numerous injuries to LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

Having zero cap space, no financial flexibility and a roster that looks like they are playing at the local YMCA at times, the Los Angeles Lakers are in big trouble and their efforts to re-shape the roster around LeBron James will be extremely tough in the offseason.

     It’s Nov. 10, 2021, and there are five seconds remaining on the shot clock for the Lakers , who lead the Miami Heat by one point with 2:23 left in overtime.
Russell Westbrook inbounds the ball to Malik Monk , who catches the pass at the edge of the Lakers’ center-court logo.
Monk quickly veers toward the left of the basket, creating just enough separation from his defender, Tyler Herro, and avoiding a double-team from a rotating P.J.
Tucker.Monk gathers himself, leaps forward and fades to his left, swishing a ridiculously tough shot in front of the Heat’s bench as the shot-clock buzzer sounds.
The clutch performance resulted in Monk’s second postgame media appearance, a duty typically reserved for the star trio of James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook.“I had this role a couple of times in Charlotte, when a lot of guys got hurt,” Monk said after the game.

     Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty ImagesLos Angeles Lakers shooting guard and impending free agent Malik Monk said that he'd "love to play" for L.A. again but that it was hard to prognosticate his future plans at this time.
I’d love to play here again, man.
L.A. is notably better when Monk's hot, going 8-2 in the 10 games where he's scored 22 or more points.
Naturally, the Lakers should look to bring him back into the mix, although he'll undoubtedly have suitors after his big year.
For now, Monk will continue playing big minutes as a starter in the Lakers' lineup.

     LeBron James was excited when the Los Angeles Lakers traded for Russell Westbrook from the Washington Wizards.
Westbrook led the NBA in turnovers during the first half of the season and had a plus-minus of -116.
LeBron, who was in his first season with the Lakers in 2018-19, called Rose a “superhero” following the 50-point game.
If LeBron is interested in playing with Rose again, the Lakers and Knicks could discuss the following trade in the offseason.
Westbrook for Rose, Burks, Barrett and Noel WorksAccording to ESPN’s trade machine, the Lakers could trade Westbrook to the Knicks for Rose, Alec Burks, RJ Barrett and Nerlens Noel.

     Anthony Davis has found himself injured so much that the talking heads have begun swirling overhead.
Below, we rank the 5 best Anthony Davis trades.
You could suggest the Bucks second best player, Khris Middleton, is as good as the Heat’s best player, Jimmy Butler, and I wouldn’t argue.
Anthony Davis is one of the few players in the world who can match up with Giannis and Durant.
Trading Anthony Davis might be the only legitimate recourse the Lakers have to upgrade their roster.
