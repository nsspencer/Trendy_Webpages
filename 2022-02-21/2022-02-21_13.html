There’s nothing wrong with being 60; I just can’t believe it.

     Courteney Cox Says Getting Injections Made Her Face Look "Really Strange"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Courteney Cox, like much of Hollywood, has transformed herself to more fully inhabit the characters she plays.
In an interview with the The Times, the Friends actor opened up about avoiding and accepting the aesthetic realities of aging.
"[And] the fact that she's going through this midlife crisis slash menopause."
"There was a time when you go, 'Oh, I'm changing.
I'm looking older'… and I didn't realize that, 'oh shit', I'm actually looking really strange with injections and doing stuff to my face that I would never do now," she says.

     Courteney Cox Opens Up About the Cosmetic Injections That She Says Left Her ‘Looking Really Strange’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Courteney Cox has been in the spotlight on and off for almost 40 years, tackling sitcom-darling roles along with her Scream Queen status.
I’m looking older.’ And I tried to chase that [youthfulness] for years,” she told the British paper.
When it comes to her past with cosmetic procedures, Cox points to the conversations she’d have with friends on how much these procedures really changed her.
In her own words, she told the Times, “I’m a product whore,” so it’s no surprise she’d move into this rapidly growing industry.
Even though she has a few years before reaching 60, Cox is ready for this new stage of her life.

     Courteney Cox is opening up about how she tried to use cosmetic procedures to stay young in the past.
“There was a time when you go, ‘Oh, I’m changing.

Cox had all her fillers dissolved, she said in 2017, and told "New Beauty" she’s as “natural as I can be.”She told New Beauty in 2017 that it was easy to gradually go overboard with different treatments.
In her recent Sunday Times Style interview, she said she it worries her that her child has more than 300,000 followers on Instagram.
