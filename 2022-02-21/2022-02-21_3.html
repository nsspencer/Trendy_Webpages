     Sam Hunt’s Wife Pregnant, Files for Divorce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sam Hunt's wife, Hannah Lee Fowler, has filed for divorce.
Infidelity is the reason for their divorce, per legal paperwork obtained by the celebrity news website.
The couple were married in 2017 in Hunt's hometown of Cedartown, Ga.
They'd been dating on and off for several years, with the ups and downs often inspiring new country songs for Hunt.
Later, he'd explained that he was out at a concert with friends and they'd been hiring Uber drivers all night.

     Sam Hunt’s Ups and Downs With Hannah Lee Fowler
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Sam Hunt and his now-estranged wife, Hannah Lee Fowler, had a love story worthy of a country song — or maybe even a whole album.
After meeting in their early 20s, the country star and Fowler dated for roughly four years until he decided to move to Nashville and pursue a music career.
“She was under the impression, and I had sure expressed this to her at some point, that she was the No.
I would choose her over everything,” Hunt told The New York Times in March 2020 about the reason for their initial split.
“I’m sorry I named the album Montevallo / I’m sorry people know your name now / And hit you up on social media,” he sings in the first verse.
