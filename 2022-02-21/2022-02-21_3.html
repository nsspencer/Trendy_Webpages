     Washington [US], February 21 (ANI): Hollywood filmmaker James Gunn recently announced his engagement to longtime girlfriend and actor Jennifer Holland.
Gunn and Holland are not only romantically involved but also have worked together as well, with her playing Emilia Harcourt in ‘The Suicide Squad’ and reprising that role in ‘Peacemaker’, opposite John Cena.
Rosenbaum had offered to set them up after the director saw a photograph of Holland and asked who she was.
When Rosenbaum’s then-girlfriend approached Holland with the idea of a setup, Holland admitted she had never heard of Gunn, despite the fact he had become pretty much a popular name.
Holland told The Hollywood Reporter last month that she was initially hesitant about going out with Gunn — “She described James as a producer-director.
