Rory McIlroy has slammed Phil Mickelson for his comments regarding the proposed Golf Super League.
Mickelson took aim at the PGA Tour for “obnoxious greed” and explained why he would be open to competing in a breakaway league, despite Saudi Arabia's questionable human rights record and inhumane LGBTQ+ laws.
The new series is set to be announced in the near future and will be a direct rival to the existing PGA Tour and DP World Tour.
The reason why such huge sums are being offered is because any golfer who does decide to join the new super league risks never being allowed to play on the PGA Tour, European Tour or in the Ryder Cup again.

     Rory McIlroy SLAMS Phil Mickelson: "Naive, selfish, egotistical, ignorant"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     On Sunday, both Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau committed their futures to the PGA Tour in official statements which ended speculation over their Saudi involvement.
"I don’t want to kick someone while he’s down obviously, but I thought they were naive, selfish, egotistical, ignorant.
I just can't see any reason why anyone would go," he added about the Saudi golf tour.
Justin Thomas, who is one of the top players to remain loyal to the PGA Tour, also described Mickelson's words as "egotistical."
In his interview with Alan Shipnuck, Mickelson claimed that by working with the Saudis, he could gain leverage and improve the PGA Tour, however, McIlroy seemed to think this wasn't necessary.

“I don’t want to kick someone while he’s down obviously, but I thought they were naïve, selfish, egotistical, ignorant,” McIlroy told reporters at the Genesis Invitational.
I’m sure he’s sitting at home sort of rethinking his position and where he goes from here.”In the interview with Shipnuck, Mickelson also claimed he recruited three other “top players” for the Super Golf League.

Speaking with Golf Channel's Matt Adams on Adams' Fairways of Life Podcast, Horschel called Mickelson's controversial comments both "idiotic" and "false" while noting that Mickelson's legacy has likely been tarnished.
In that interview, Mickelson talked about overlooking the Saudis' poor human-rights record in order to gain leverage on the PGA Tour.
