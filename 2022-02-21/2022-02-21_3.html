Just an ugly all around incident that apparently stemmed from the fact that the Wisconsin coach called a timeout with around 30 seconds left in a decisive win.
Anyway, the Big Ten issued a statement last night, singling Howard out for his actionsThe Big Ten has released a statement.

     Judgement day is coming for Juwan Howard, perhaps as soon as Monday.
The Big Ten is expected to take swift action against the Michigan head coach for igniting a brawl Sunday at the Kohl Center in Madison, Wisc.
Wisconsin head coach Greg Gard called a timeout with 15 seconds left and the game well in hand.
Per Mlive.com:“I didn’t like the timeout being called and I’ll be totally honest with you,” Howard said in his postgame press conference.
The teams gathered and Howard threw a punch at Wisconsin assistant coach Joe Krabbenhoft.

     Juwan Howard: Michigan head coach throws punch at end of college basketball game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Juwan Howard speaks to the media regarding a fight that broke out on the court after an NCAA college basketball game against Wisconsin.
CNN —Michigan men’s basketball head coach Juwan Howard threw a punch during postgame handshakes after his team’s game against Wisconsin on Sunday.
Following the Michigan Wolverines’ 77-63 loss against the Wisconsin Badgers, Howard and Wisconsin’s head coach Greg Gard shook hands, and Howard could be seen saying something to Gard.
Gard grabbed Howard with his left hand to stop the Michigan coach from moving to the next person to shake hands with, which seemed to anger Howard.

     But Michigan's players didn't stop competing.
Michigan coach Juwan Howard took offense to this, for some reason.
Then, incredibly, Howard smacked Wisconsin assistant Joe Krabbenhoft in the face, which, unsurprisingly, set off a melee.
But don't forget the root of this entire deal was Howard getting mad about a timeout Gard called only because Michigan's players were still competing.

     He starts with the least offensive issues — the decisions by Juwan Howard to press late and Greg Gard to call a late timeout — and goes from there.
"I get why Juwan Howard was angry," Williams said.
You heard Juwan Howard say, 'Don't grab me, do not touch me.'
"Juwan Howard should not worry about Greg Gard calling timeout and Greg Gard shouldn't worry about Juwan Howard pressing," Greenberg said.
Juwan Howard didn't want to deal with Greg Gard.

He doesn’t like Gard calling a timeout, but it happened because he’s pressing UW’s scrubs?
GA: For sure, probably Terrance Williams too, although it looks like he’s mostly trying to break it up.
