     OHIO (WJW) – Musician Jane Marczewski, who performed under the name Nightbirde and captured hearts around the world amidst her courageous battle with cancer, has died, according to TMZ.
Nightbirde became an overnight sensation in June 2021 with a tear-jerking performance on “America’s Got Talent.”She shared on the show she was battling her third bout of cancer.
I am so sad to announce that I won’t be able to continue forward on this season of AGT.
She was given the Golden Buzzer during the second round of AGT auditions in June 2021.
As much as I feel horribly about her passing I feel lucky to to have met, heard and known her,” he wrote.
