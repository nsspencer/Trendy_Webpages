     With criminal investigation still pending, Deshaun Watson fails to delay testifying in civil case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Anything he says while testifying in the civil cases can be used against him in the criminal case.
As a result, the lawyers handling the 22 civil cases went to court on Monday, squabbling over whether Watson’s deposition will be delayed until the criminal case is resolved.
Attorney Rusty Hardin, who represents Watson, wants to delay the process until after the criminal process has ended.
For those plaintiffs who have filed criminal complaints, Watson will testify after April 1.
The best seats could be filled before the criminal process ends.

     Texans 3 'Inevitable' Trades: Deshaun Watson, Laremy Tunsil and ... Brandin Cooks?!

     “The Watson trade, the Tunsil trade and probably a Brandin Cooks trade kind of looks inevitable right now,” Ginnitti said on Monday.
It's no secret at all that the Houston Texans are gearing up to engineer a blockbuster trade-away of quarterback Deshaun Watson.
And receiver Brandin Cooks?
Per Michael Ginnitti of Sportrac, the Texans might be expected to trade Watson (check), Tunsil and Cooks (hmm).
In fact, he termed that trio of trades to be “inevitable.”“The Watson trade, the Tunsil trade and probably a Brandin Cooks trade kind of looks inevitable right now,” Ginnitti said on Monday.

     Texans news: Deshaun Watson dealt blow in court on sexual assault cases
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Houston Texans star quarterback Deshaun Watson’s bout with his sexual assault cases is far from over.
At this point, a major problem is brewing for Watson’s camp with his criminal case now getting intertwined with the civil cases he’s also been dealing with.
Right now, anything the Texans QB says while under oath in his civil cases can be used against him during the proceedings of his criminal case.
By the time Watson’s criminal case comes to an end, it’s very much possible that the majority of the quarterback openings would have already been filled.
It’s a tough road ahead for Deshaun Watson.

     Report: Hearing scheduled in Texans QB Deshaun Watson lawsuit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A hearing has been scheduled for Monday afternoon in the lawsuit involving Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson.
According to a report from ABC 13 [KTRK-TV] via Tony Buzbee, the attorney who represents the 22 plaintiffs who allege Watson committed sexual assault, the hearing is slated for Monday afternoon.
Rusty Hardin, the attorney who represents Watson, told ABC 13 that the special hearing will decide whether or not Watson’s deposition — which was scheduled for Feb. 24 — can be delayed until the 22 plaintiffs have been deposed.
The report indicates that as of Feb. 20, officials are not finished deposing the plaintiffs.
In addition to the lawsuit, there have been 10 complaints filed with the Houston Police Department against Watson, some of which are already covered in the lawsuit.

     A Deshaun Watson Update with an Eagles' Tint
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Texans want to deal Deshaun Watson by the NFL Draft but things remain complicatedAn ongoing criminal investigation is impacting Deshaun Watson’s plan to get out of Houston and back onto an NFL playing field.
The new NFL league year starts March 16 and the draft begins on April 28, the wheelhouse when it comes to the league and leverage for potential trades.
The reason for Hardin’s request can be traced to the open criminal investigation of Watson by the Houston Police Department.
In layman’s terms that means Hardin doesn’t want Watson being deposed under oath until the criminal investigation runs its course.
Dolphins owner Stephen Ross signed off on the acquisition on the condition Watson settled all of his outstanding civil complaints.

“It is undisputed that Mr. Watson is under a criminal investigation based upon some of the Plaintiffs’ claims,” the motion stated.
