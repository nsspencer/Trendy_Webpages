     Before Her Oscar Nominations, Jennifer Lawrence Starred In This Dull Thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It feels impossible to think of a bad Jennifer Lawrence movie as Lawrence is so talented and amazes audiences, whether she's appearing in a dark comedy or drama.
But back in 2012, Jennifer Lawrence starred in a thriller that wasn't popular, and that stands out among the rest of her credits.
It would seem like an odd pivot for Lawrence to star in this dull thriller after the gripping Winter's Bone, The Hunger Games, and The Silver Linings Playbook.
RELATED: Jennifer Lawrence Open To Joining MCU, Just Not As MystiqueThe House At The End Of The Street wasn't a hit with audiences or critics, and it's far from one of Jennifer Lawrence's best movies.
If audiences peel back the layers, they will see that the movie doesn't really have a strong premise or any meaning behind it.
