     Tulsi Gabbard calls Kamala Harris' Russia marks 'embarrassing': This is not rocket science
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former Democratic Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard slammed the Biden administration Monday on "Hannity," calling out Kamala Harris’ "embarrassing" Russia remarks and saying the Vide President does not have the temperament to be the voice of the United States on the world stage.
TULSI GABBARD: This is embarrassing.
It’s clear she [Kamala Harris] was sent there to be the voice of the United States as a purely political calculation.
She has no concept of the cost of war nor does she have the temperament necessary to be the voice of the United States on the global stage.
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have said we are going to incur a cost.

     Sean Hannity Pushes Back as Tulsi Gabbard Defends Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fox News host Sean Hannity pushed back on Monday after former Representative Tulsi Gabbard appeared to defend Russia, citing the country's "security" concerns about the U.S. and NATO.
Gabbard, a Democrat who represented Hawaii's 2nd congressional district from 2013 to 2021, told Hannity that Russia doesn't want U.S. and NATO military forces on its borders.
"I want to stay focused on the security component," Gabbard said, but addressed the issue raised by Hannity, saying Putin's claims about Ukraine "go way back."
"It is highly unlikely Ukraine will ever become a member of NATO," Gabbard said.
Hannity told Gabbard he might be "a little more suspicious than you in believing that, I think, this very personal for Putin."

     Tulsi Gabbard to Speak at CPAC, Joining Its ‘Great Un-Wokening’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tulsi Gabbard, the former Hawaii congresswoman who sought the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, is completing her metamorphosis from iconoclast progressive to hardcore conservative by appearing as a featured guest at the Trumpy love-in known as the Conservative Political Action Conference.
CPAC 2022 begins Wednesday in Orlando, where Gabbard will join a roster of GOP loyalists — including Florida Gov.
According to the conference agenda, Gabbard will appear at the Friday night “Ronald Reagan Dinner,” where the keynote speaker is the former Fox News star conspiracy theorist Glenn Beck.
Gabbard launched her 2020 campaign with an apology for her past anti-LGBTQ views and closed it with a robust endorsement of Joe Biden for president, speaking to her affection for his late son Beau.
Now he promises to choose Supreme Court nominee on the same criteria.

     On Monday, organizers confirmed that former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard would be a 'special guest' at CPAC's Friday night Ronald Reagan Dinner.
There's former Republican Rep. Denver Riggleman, who was primaried by a far-right GOP candidate after he officiated a gay wedding.
Meanwhile back in Washington, prominent Trump critics will gather at the two-day Principles First summit.
So far, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is the only prominent Democrat slated to appear at CPAC, a gathering for those on the political right.
When she came to Congress in 2013, she forged an across-the-aisle Congressional Future Caucus with Republican Rep. Aaron Schock, before he resigned in scandal.

“There was a time when you go, ‘Oh, I’m changing.

Cox had all her fillers dissolved, she said in 2017, and told "New Beauty" she’s as “natural as I can be.”She told New Beauty in 2017 that it was easy to gradually go overboard with different treatments.

     Sean Hannity Pushes Back as Tulsi Gabbard Defends Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fox News host Sean Hannity pushed back on Monday after former Representative Tulsi Gabbard appeared to defend Russia, citing the country's "security" concerns about the U.S. and NATO.
Gabbard, a Democrat who represented Hawaii's 2nd congressional district from 2013 to 2021, told Hannity that Russia doesn't want U.S. and NATO military forces on its borders.
"I want to stay focused on the security component," Gabbard said, but addressed the issue raised by Hannity, saying Putin's claims about Ukraine "go way back."
"It is highly unlikely Ukraine will ever become a member of NATO," Gabbard said.
Hannity told Gabbard he might be "a little more suspicious than you in believing that, I think, this very personal for Putin."

     Tulsi Gabbard to Speak at CPAC, Joining Its ‘Great Un-Wokening’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tulsi Gabbard, the former Hawaii congresswoman who sought the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, is completing her metamorphosis from iconoclast progressive to hardcore conservative by appearing as a featured guest at the Trumpy love-in known as the Conservative Political Action Conference.
CPAC 2022 begins Wednesday in Orlando, where Gabbard will join a roster of GOP loyalists — including Florida Gov.
According to the conference agenda, Gabbard will appear at the Friday night “Ronald Reagan Dinner,” where the keynote speaker is the former Fox News star conspiracy theorist Glenn Beck.
Gabbard launched her 2020 campaign with an apology for her past anti-LGBTQ views and closed it with a robust endorsement of Joe Biden for president, speaking to her affection for his late son Beau.
Now he promises to choose Supreme Court nominee on the same criteria.

     On Monday, organizers confirmed that former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard would be a 'special guest' at CPAC's Friday night Ronald Reagan Dinner.
There's former Republican Rep. Denver Riggleman, who was primaried by a far-right GOP candidate after he officiated a gay wedding.
Meanwhile back in Washington, prominent Trump critics will gather at the two-day Principles First summit.
So far, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is the only prominent Democrat slated to appear at CPAC, a gathering for those on the political right.
When she came to Congress in 2013, she forged an across-the-aisle Congressional Future Caucus with Republican Rep. Aaron Schock, before he resigned in scandal.
