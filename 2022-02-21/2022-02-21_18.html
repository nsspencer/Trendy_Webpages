     That sounds like an auspices release launch until you do the math and realize that in the first two days it was available West only sold about 10,00 copies of Donda 2 and the Stream Players needed to play it.
Compare that to the first Donda album which in its first week of release reached No.
1 in 11 countries and had more than 775 million global steam including 442 million on Spotify and 242 million on Apple Music.
Even with 5 more days to complete the sales week, Donda 2 has a long way to go.
West also announced a Donda Live Experience “combining music art and fashion”engineered by fashion brand Balenciaga.

     Here are the SoCal cinemas streaming Kanye West’s ‘Donda 2’ concert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Fans of Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, will get a chance to see his one-night-only concert in select theaters around the U.S. on Tuesday.
That will be a relief to those who want to listen to “Donda 2" but don’t want to fork out $200 for the musician’s Stem Player listening device — the only place where his new album will live.
“Kanye West: Donda Experience Performance 2 22 22" will screen in Imax at three SoCal theaters: the AMC Century City and the TCL Chinese Theatre Hollywood, as well as the AMC Orange 30 in Orange County.
Should “Donda 2" remain available to stream only on Ye’s Stem Player, the musician will join the growing list of artists and podcasters to flee Spotify in recent weeks.
The screenings and concert follow part one of “Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy,” a new documentary that premiered on Netflix last week; it follows the rapper’s life and career.
