     Sherri Shepherd and Wendy Williams @sherrieshepherd via Twitter / @wendy williams via Twitter“The producers informed everyone that [The Wendy Williams Show] was being canceled at the end of June," a source close to production reportedly told LoveBScott.com exclusively.
Shepherd's deal with Debmar-Mercury, which is the TV syndication company that leases The Wendy Williams Show, was finalized recently.
Shepherd proved she could handle her own talk show when she boosted ratings for the The Wendy Williams Show as one of many guest hosts in Wendy Williams's absence.
A sources told LoveBScott.com previously that executives for The Wendy Williams Show have been trying to end the series for several years.
Debmar-Mercury renewed The Wendy Williams Show, despite her frequent hiatuses for medical and personal reasons, after the short-lived The Jerry O'Connell Show had abysmal ratings.
