     Goran Dragić free agency: Nets sign veteran point guard
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Free agent point guard Goran Dragić is signing a deal with the Nets, according to The Athletic’s Shams Charania.
Brooklyn will waive guard Jevon Carter to clear a roster spot for Dragić, per ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.
He then agreed to a buyout with the Raptors and entered free agency where he was sought after by several teams, per The Athletic.
Irving has been available on the road due to his vaccination status, while Durant is currently out with a sprained MCL.
He hasn't appeared in a game since Nov. 13 due to personal reasons, according to the Raptors.

     Nets signing Goran Dragic in free agency: Sources

     The Brooklyn Nets are signing free-agent guard Goran Dragic, sources tell The Athletic.
Dragic will reunite with his former Phoenix Suns teammate and Nets coach Steve Nash in Brooklyn.
Dragic entered free agency after the San Antonio Spurs bought out his contract following his trade from the Toronto Raptors earlier this month.
The Raptors sent Dragic to San Antonio ahead of the NBA trade deadline in exchange for power forward Thaddeus Young, center Drew Eubanks and draft picks.
In five games with the Raptors, Dragic averaged eight points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists.

     Goran Dragic signs with Nets: Veteran guard will pursue title in Brooklyn after buyout from Spurs, per report

     Goran Dragic is signing with the Brooklyn Nets now that he has secured a buyout from the San Antonio Spurs, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania.
Dragic played just five games as a Raptor before leaving the team for personal reasons.
He was dealt to San Antonio on Feb. 10 (trade deadline day), but the rebuilding Spurs had no need for his services.
In Dragic, the Nets have given themselves an insurance policy against Irving's absence and Simmons' postseason problems.
No other contender could offer Dragic the minutes and touches that Brooklyn can due to Irving's unique circumstances.
