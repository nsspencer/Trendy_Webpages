    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     After 6 years and two updates, Capcom is finally moving on from Street Fighter 5 and has officially announced Street Fighter 6.
As teased through a countdown website, Capcom has officially announced Street Fighter 6 following the end of the Capcom Pro Tour fighting game exhibition.
LoadingThe next game in Capcom's marquis fighting game series will follow one of the most turbulent entries in the Street Fighter series.
The initial response to Street Fighter 5 was tepid, though subsequent updates like Street Fighter 5: Arcade Edition and Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition were better received.

     Street Fighter 6 teaser puts Ryu and Luke at center stage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Capcom has officially announced that the next mainline entry in the Street Fighter series, Street Fighter 6, is in the works.
The game was announced at the end of the Capcom Pro Tour, Capcom’s global Street Fighter tournament series, with a very short teaser.
The latest release in the Street Fighter series, Street Fighter 5, went through five years of ups and downs, ending with a final DLC character named Luke who Capcom claims represents the future of the series.
Luke is featured in the Street Fighter 6 teaser front and center alongside the series’ poster boy, Ryu, who is shown to be moving on to his bearded “Sexy Ryu” look that was introduced as an alternate in SF5.
While the trailer gives a small glimpse at who we can expect to headline the story and a confirmation that Luke is indeed the new series protagonist as Street Fighter 5 teased, that’s really all that was shown.

Like many, I'm very much hoping it's simply acting as a placeholder while the usual iconic Street Fighter logo is being drawn up and polished.

     Street Fighter 6's logo isn't winning fans over
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Pleasing the fighting game community is no easy task, and Street Fighter 6’s logo proves that crowd will meme questionable artistic choices into oblivion if given the opportunity.
Capcom went ahead with Street Fighter 6’s announcement Monday in a rather slick trailer.
However, Street Fighter 6’s logo quickly became the focal point of every discussion mainly because the logo looks generic and lacks that distinct vibrant flair the series does best.
Before we move on, take a moment to watch Street Fighter 6’s announcement trailer to see why fans don’t like the logo.
It doesn’t help the situation that Capcom didn’t actually show gameplay or anything beyond mentioning Street Fighter 6 is running on the RE Engine, which powers Capcom’s other titles like Resident Evil Village and Monster Hunter Rise.

     People Think They Can See Ryu’s Dick In The Street Fighter 6 Reveal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Apart from the game’s crappy, minimalistic logo, some of the most consistent chatter surrounding the recent Street Fighter 6 reveal has to do with series protagonist Ryu.
AdvertisementOkay, I’m sorry, let’s stop beating around the bush (pun absolutely intended): People think they can see Ryu’s dick in the trailer.
“My timeline is quickly pivoting to conversation about Ryu’s visible dick outline, so the [Street Fighter 6] teaser made an impact after all,” wrote one Twitter user.
“Since Ryu has [noticeable] dick bulge in Street Fighter 6, I hope Ken doesn’t,” a third joked, referencing Ryu’s blonde-haired, American rival.
Anyway, we should be getting what I expect to be less dick-related (and thus more than likely less interesting) info on Street Fighter 6 this summer.

     Learn MoreThe Street Fighter 6 Detail That Has Fans Up In ArmsCapcom dropped an announcement trailer for "Street Fighter 6" yesterday, which should have excited fans.
"Street Fighter 5" pleased critics and average players alike, and one would expect "Street Fighter 6" would build on its momentum.
"Street Fighter" historically boasts fiery branding, like typeface that burns with fighting spirit.
Text features a smooth, minimalist "SF" framed in a hexagon, and "Street Fighter" spelled beneath in neat print.
However, next to "Street Fighter" logos of the past, it looks undeniably uncharacteristic.

     Capcom announced the next iteration of its popular fighting game series, Street Fighter 6, on Monday.
Naturally, this new Ryu has prompted fans to create memes and make jokes about the especially wide boy.
If you haven’t seen the trailer, Ryu squares off against another Street Fighter character, Luke, as a camera lingers on a hyper-realistic render of his body.
The trailer was posted yesterday but people have already responded by drawing fan art poking fun at how wide Ryu is.

     Capcom also revealed Street Fighter 6's logo with the announcement trailer, though it's being widely criticized online.
Many fans have expressed their disappointment in the Street Fighter 6 logo, criticizing it as lazy.
Well, it's now come to light that the logo is virtually identical to some Adobe stock art.
As pointed out by Aurich on Twitter, Adobe stock art for an "SF" letter logo design is sold for $80 on the marketplace.
