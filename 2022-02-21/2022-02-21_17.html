     One woman dead, five others injured in shooting at Portland, Oregon park
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     One woman was killed and five others injured during a shooting Saturday night in Portland.
The Portland Police Bureau said that the woman was dead when officers arrived just after 8 p.m. at the scene near Normandale Park, a frequent hub for protests against racism and police killings.
An initial statement from Portland police said that homicide detectives were investigating the scene and that the Oregon State Medical Examiner would determine the cause and manner of the victim’s death.
Portland police said the scene of the shooting “was extremely chaotic, and a number of witnesses were uncooperative with responding officers.
Detectives believe a large number of people either witnessed what happened, or recorded the incident as it unfolded.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     A shooting rampage in Oregon that left a Portland woman dead and five people wounded started with a confrontation between an armed homeowner and armed protesters, police say.
"The scene was extremely chaotic, and a number of witnesses were uncooperative with responding officers," the Portland Police Bureau said in a statement.
