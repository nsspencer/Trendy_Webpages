     'The Endgame' makes the right moves in its cop-criminal chess match
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Having enjoyed its share of success with "The Blacklist" and various imitators, NBC treads similar terrain with "The Endgame," whose major wrinkle and upgrade involves casting Morena Baccarin (icily similar to her early "V" role) as a mysterious femme fatale.
Slickly made and fast paced, it makes for an enjoyable thriller, although it's a dice roll as to how long that can last.
"You've messed with the wrong woman," Elena informs her captors, later warning them, "Don't poke the tiger with a short stick."
Although the big brass are predictably clueless, one agent, Val Turner ("First Wives Club's" Ryan Michelle Bathé), has a history with Federova, recognizing the scope of the plot.
Yet she comes with baggage in the form of her disgraced husband, while clearly representing the only person on the other side of the chessboard that the criminal mastermind respects.

Meanwhile, Federal Agent Val Turner (All Rise‘s Ryan Michelle Bathé) is visiting her fed husband Owen (Rosewood‘s Kamal Angelo Bolden) in prison, where he’s serving a 10-year sentence for taking drug money.
Elena doesn’t say much about the revelation that she’s a mother, except that her and Sergey’s child is safe.

The episode is about Elena and Val, but it's orchestrated by Elena.
She's going to be shown a lot of flaws to the system she's loyal to.
Each one of these episodes will have Elena talk someone down and give us another piece of Elena's plan.

     James Gunn &amp; Vigilante Actor Explain Peacemaker Finale Cut Eagly Joke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James Gunn and Vigilante actor Freddie Stroma explain a cut Eagly joke from the Peacemaker season 1 finale.
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYBefore Peacemaker even aired its season 1 finale, the HBO Max spin-off was renewed for a second season with Gunn returning to write and direct all episodes.
Gunn explains that the cut joke was from the scene when Eagly was disobeying Peacemaker and that was Vigilante's absurd idea for demonstrating dominance and getting him to listen.
Check out the exchange below:That’s #Vigilante telling #Peacemaker that he needed to be dominant over #Eagly for Eagly to listen to him (which he wasn’t doing).

     The Endgame boss teases where Elena Federova's plan goes next

     The Endgame Morena Baccarin as Elena Federova | Credit: Eric Liebowitz/NBCENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Elena spends the entire pilot in one room.
The episode is about Elena and Val, but it's orchestrated by Elena.
She's going to be shown a lot of flaws to the system she's loyal to.
Each one of these episodes will have Elena talk someone down and give us another piece of Elena's plan.
It's not just baddies, they all did something very specific and it's part of the revelation of the series going forward.
