    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Ohio State basketball team lost their first home game of the season on Saturday when they fell to Iowa.
Ohio State once again had a halftime lead, leading this one by five points.
In fact, it looked like the Ohio State basketball team was going to blow the game.
Ohio State needed every single one of those points as they won 80-69 in OT.
Ohio State could not afford a second loss in a row at home, especially in a game they led by 11.

The "Suicide Squad" director, 55 — who later released the spin-off, "Peacemaker," centered on the anti-hero played by John Cena — popped the question to his longtime partner.
Within minutes, congratulatory comments came pouring in from friends of the newly-engaged pair with "Suicide Squad" star Viola Davis, replying ""Aaaaaaaahhh!!!!!
'THE SUICIDE SQUAD' DIRECTOR JAMES GUNN, WHO WAS FIRED FROM 'GUARDIANS' THEN REHIRED, TALKS CANCEL CULTUREMichael Rosenbaum — who is credited with introducing the couple back in 2015 — simply wrote, "phenomenal."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Ohio State basketball team has been on the fringe of the Big Ten title hunt for weeks now but has yet to really make a move.
The Buckeyes have played a ton of close games and with a bounce here or there, or a little more smarts and effort at times, could easily be in first place in the league.
Instead, OSU sits just on the outside looking in, but close enough for their prospects of wrestling away a Big Ten championship to go either way.
Go on a run starting today and Ohio State can put itself in a good position with plenty of home games to go.
But it all starts with the game against Indiana, a team that had exposed a huge mismatch with Trayce Jackson-Davis the first time around in Bloomington.

     James Gunn &amp; Vigilante Actor Explain Peacemaker Finale Cut Eagly Joke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     James Gunn and Vigilante actor Freddie Stroma explain a cut Eagly joke from the Peacemaker season 1 finale.
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYBefore Peacemaker even aired its season 1 finale, the HBO Max spin-off was renewed for a second season with Gunn returning to write and direct all episodes.
Gunn explains that the cut joke was from the scene when Eagly was disobeying Peacemaker and that was Vigilante's absurd idea for demonstrating dominance and getting him to listen.
Check out the exchange below:That’s #Vigilante telling #Peacemaker that he needed to be dominant over #Eagly for Eagly to listen to him (which he wasn’t doing).
