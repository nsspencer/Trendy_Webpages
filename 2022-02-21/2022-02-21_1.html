     KYIV, Ukraine — In his speech to the Russian nation on Monday, President Vladimir V. Putin buoyed his case for codifying the cleavage of two rebel territories from Ukraine by arguing that the very idea of Ukrainian statehood was a fiction.
With a conviction of an authoritarian unburdened by historical nuance, Mr. Putin declared Ukraine an invention of the Bolshevik revolutionary leader, Vladimir Lenin, who he said had mistakenly endowed Ukraine with a sense of statehood by allowing it autonomy within the newly created Soviet state.
“Modern Ukraine was entirely and fully created by Russia, more specifically the Bolshevik, communist Russia,” Mr. Putin said.
“This process began practically immediately after the 1917 revolution, and moreover Lenin and his associates did it in the sloppiest way in relation to Russia — by dividing, tearing from her pieces of her own historical territory.”As a misreading of history, it was extreme even by the standards of Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B.
officer who has declared the Soviet Union’s collapse the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.

     Some officials appeared visibly nervous, while others made thinly veiled calls for a large-scale military offensive against Ukraine.
“That’s not what we’re talking about,” Mr. Putin shot back.
To some Russians, the spectacle of the televised meeting underscored that they had no way of influencing decisions being made in the Kremlin.
“I understand that practically nothing depends on you in this situation,” said Dasha Kryshnikova, a 19-year-old architecture student, in central Moscow.
Russians “feel they can’t influence the process at all,” said Aleksandra Arkhipova, a Moscow social anthropologist, who found that there had been relatively little discussion of a possible war with Ukraine online before the propaganda barrage of recent days.

     Live updates: Ukraine-Russia crisis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said nobody can predict the future of the Nord Stream 2gas pipeline, following Russia’s actions in eastern Ukraine, after earlier halting the progression of the pipeline.
The 750-mile pipeline was completed in September but has not yet received final certification from German regulators.
Without that, natural gas cannot flow through the Baltic Sea pipeline from Russia to Germany.
The United States, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and several EU countries have opposed the pipeline since it was announced in 2015, warning the project would increase Moscow's influence in Europe.
Nord Stream 2 could deliver 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year.

     The new rules tighten rules already in place that restrict U.S. banks and investors from participating in Russia's government-bond market.
Tuesday's move extends the ban to the trading of Russian government bonds in secondary markets, meaning buying them from other investors.
Most Russian government debt is issued locally in rubles, where reliance on foreign investors has dropped in recent years.
Russia has been less aggressive in raising debt in foreign currencies since a debt crisis crippled the economy in 1998.
The issuance was led by a trio of Russian banks that aren't on Tuesday's sanctions list.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     U.S. officials want to ensure more oil and gas supply gets on the market if prices do rise.
“Doing anything that affects … or halts energy transactions would have a great impact on the United States, American citizens and our allies.
U.S. officials are also working closely with other countries to ensure more supply gets on the market if prices do rise, the official added.
That could include releasing government-owned oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as the Biden administration did last year.
U.S. officials have been talking with countries from around the world, including in the Middle East and Asia, which have been reluctant to join the U.S. in other recent reserve releases.

     White House doesn't close the door on Nord Stream 2 coming back onlineWhite House Press secretary Jen Psaki did not rule out the possibility that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline come come back online after reaching an agreement with Germany to tank the project in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine.
Asked by Fox News' Hillary Vaughn if she could rule out the possibility that Biden would allow the project to proceed in the future, Psaki would only say that Biden has "never" been supportive of the pipeline and that it was never operational before the punitive measures taken by the U.S. and Germany Tuesday.
Psaki said the president has "always criticized" the pipeline "as a project that we didn't support," noting that the sanctions issued "make that very clear."

     Timothy Snyder, a history professor at Yale University, told MSNBC on Monday that Putin's take was "surreal."
Ukrainian nationalism went back 100 years before the beginning of the Soviet Union, and elements of Ukrainian history go back to the Middle Ages, Snyder said.
Will Russian troops remain confined to the Moscow-backed separatist regions in the country’s east, itself widely seen as a violation of international law?
Ukrainian troops, like this one near the village of Travneve on Monday, have been fighting Russian-backed separatists since 2014.
“Russian troops moving into Donbass would not itself be a new step,” a senior U.S. administration official told reporters Monday.

     White House doesn't close the door on Nord Stream 2 coming back onlineWhite House Press secretary Jen Psaki did not rule out the possibility that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline come come back online after reaching an agreement with Germany to tank the project in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine.
Asked by Fox News' Hillary Vaughn if she could rule out the possibility that Biden would allow the project to proceed in the future, Psaki would only say that Biden has "never" been supportive of the pipeline and that it was never operational before the punitive measures taken by the U.S. and Germany Tuesday.
Psaki said the president has "always criticized" the pipeline "as a project that we didn't support," noting that the sanctions issued "make that very clear."

     Kyiv braces for conflict, West sanctions Russia after Putin orders troops into eastern Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Ukraine braced for a potential conflict with Russia Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.
"We still believe that Russia is poised to go much further in launching a massive military attack against Ukraine," Biden warned.
Vast swaths of those regions are held by the Ukrainian military, raising concerns about further armed conflict breaking out as Russian troops move in.
“There are masses of Russian troops, who were coming there all night," he said, referring to the two Moscow-backed separatist areas.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Tuesday that “Russian troops have entered in Donbas.” He added, “I wouldn’t say that’s a fully fledged invasion, but Russian troops are on Ukrainian soil.”

     U.S. sanctions Russia for declaring independence of eastern Ukraine territories
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Putin’s decision a “flagrant disrespect for international law and norms,” and noted the executive order is designed to prevent Russia from profiting off of the move.
The executive order followed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s lengthy televised address on Monday, when he laid out his decision to recognize the independence of the two breakaway regions.
That agreement was seen as the only way to settle the eight-year-long conflict in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine.
Biden held a series of meetings on Monday, first with his national security team as murmurs of Putin’s decision began to circulate.
The president also held calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, according to the White House.
