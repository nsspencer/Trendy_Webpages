     U.S. Offers Limited Initial Response to Russia as It Weighs Stiffer Sanctions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mr. Putin’s incremental approach to ratcheting up the pressure on Ukraine appears intended to exploit any fissures in what has been a quite unified NATO and European posture.
Some nations may be reluctant to reach for the most punishing sanctions if Mr. Putin’s forces remain in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, where Russia has exercised great influence during an eight-year conflict.
Yet the limited geographic reach of Mr. Putin’s initial claim on Ukrainian territory stood in sharp contrast to the implication in his winding, hourlong speech on Monday that the entire country was a part of Russia.
But it is unclear that Mr. Putin cares about the next round of sanctions, believing that his economy can withstand anything Mr. Biden and other Western leaders throw at him.
In his speech, he referred to Mr. Biden’s sanctions threats as “blackmail,” saying they would have been “put in place on Russia regardless of what happens in Ukraine.”“The purpose,” he argued, is “to keep Russia behind, to prevent it from developing.

     Live updates: Ukraine-Russia crisis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Yet again, the world is hanging on what Russian President Vladimir Putin does next.
But the omens, after his grievance-filled televised vent against Ukraine, the West and the indignities of history on Monday, are very, very dark.
Putin significantly escalated his showdown with the US and its allies, signing decrees recognizing two regions of eastern Ukraine seized by Russian-backed rebels.
Its euphemism notwithstanding, US officials fear that the force could be the vanguard of the full invasion mobilization they have predicted for days.
Such a step back — perhaps designed to divide the US from less hawkish allies — might avoid a wider global crisis.

     Vladimir Putin Has Officially Ordered Russian Troops Into Eastern Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     DNIPRO, Ukraine — Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into eastern Ukraine Monday, authorizing an invasion that threatens a large-scale military conflict and could put thousands of lives in danger.
Ukraine’s government currently has no presence in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and it is unclear if Putin moving troops in and annexing them would be considered an invasion of Ukraine by Western allies.
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US Ambassador to the UN, derided Putin calling his troops "peacekeepers."
An invasion of Ukraine unleashes the forces of war, death and destruction on the people of Ukraine."
Ukraine's member said, “the internally recognized borders of Ukraine will remain unchangeable," and that is views Russia's moves as "violations of the sovereignty and territory of Ukraine."

     Both the US and UK believe that the Russian entry into the eastern tip of Ukraine is a precursor for a more sweeping invasion.
She cast doubt on Putin’s assertion that the Russian troops would take on a “peacekeeping” role in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas.
On Monday night, Kenya’s permanent representative, Martin Kimani, delivered a powerful address, suggesting Russia learn to live with ethnic grievances just as African states have done.
Vasily Nebenzya, the Russian permanent representative repeated Moscow’s unfounded claims that Ukraine was about to launch an attack on the eastern Moscow-backed enclaves, presented as a pretext for sending in Russian troops.
The Chinese permanent representative, Zhang Yun, made a very brief, non-committal statement, which observers said suggested that Beijing has yet to make up its mind.

     Global Markets Fall After Russia Orders Troops Into Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Global stock indexes and U.S. futures fell, while crude-oil futures climbed after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into two breakaway areas of Ukraine that he had earlier recognized as independent.
Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average closed down 461.26 points, or 1.7%, to 26449.61, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 3.1%.
Bond yields fall as prices rise, and investors typically bid up the prices of safe-haven assets such as U.S. government bonds at times of stress.
Mr. Ichikawa said a Russian invasion of Ukraine would likely prompt strict economic sanctions from the U.S. and Europe, curbing international supplies of Russian oil.
In that scenario, “If oil prices rise sharply beyond $100, gasoline prices will rise in the U.S., and inflation will accelerate further, forcing the Fed to consider raising rates at a faster pace,” he said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Otherwise, all responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine,” Putin said.
Russia has tens of thousands troops along different parts of the border with Ukraine.
Rep. Liz Cheney tweeted, “Russia has invaded Ukraine,” and Michael McFaul, who served as Obama’s ambassador to Russia, said the same.
Biden’s CIA director, William Burns, who served as ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008, had predicted that giving Ukraine NATO membership would “create fertile soil for Russian meddling in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.” (Ukraine isn’t part of NATO and was not expected to join anytime soon, but the country has deepened cooperation with the West since 2014).
In Monday’s speech and in a July 2021 essay, he claimed Ukraine is part of a “unified state” with Russia.
