     U.S. Offers Limited Initial Response to Russia as It Weighs Stiffer Sanctions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mr. Putin’s incremental approach to ratcheting up the pressure on Ukraine appears intended to exploit any fissures in what has been a quite unified NATO and European posture.
Some nations may be reluctant to reach for the most punishing sanctions if Mr. Putin’s forces remain in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, where Russia has exercised great influence during an eight-year conflict.
Yet the limited geographic reach of Mr. Putin’s initial claim on Ukrainian territory stood in sharp contrast to the implication in his winding, hourlong speech on Monday that the entire country was a part of Russia.
But it is unclear that Mr. Putin cares about the next round of sanctions, believing that his economy can withstand anything Mr. Biden and other Western leaders throw at him.
In his speech, he referred to Mr. Biden’s sanctions threats as “blackmail,” saying they would have been “put in place on Russia regardless of what happens in Ukraine.”“The purpose,” he argued, is “to keep Russia behind, to prevent it from developing.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The European Union will impose sanctions on Moscow following the “unacceptable” entry of Russian troops into the Donbas region of Ukraine, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Tuesday.
“Obviously we are going to initiate sanctions,” Le Drian said ahead of a meeting of European foreign ministers in Paris.
“It’s a violation of international law, it’s an attack on the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine, it’s Russia renouncing its international commitments and the Minsk accords that it had signed," Le Drian said.
"So the situation is very serious.”He added that European leaders had three messages to convey — taking a firm stance against Russia's actions, showing solidarity with Ukraine, and showing unity in Europe.
EU High Representative Joseph Borrell said Tuesday morning that he had called an emergency informal meeting of EU foreign ministers to discuss Ukraine following a planned summit.

     Oil rises as Russia-Ukraine escalation spurs supply concerns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Crude oil storage tanks are seen from above at the Cushing oil hub, in Cushing, Oklahoma, March 24, 2016.
REUTERS/Nick OxfordNEW DELHI, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped more than $2 on Tuesday on supply disruption worries as tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated after Moscow ordered troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.
Moscow's move drew international condemnation and U.S. officials said Washington in coordination with allies is planning to announce new sanctions on Russia, the world's second largest oil producer.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures jumped $3.60, or 3.95%, to $94.67 a barrel versus Friday's settlement.
However, Russia itself could hold back oil and gas supplies if it sought to retaliate against any other sanctions imposed by the West, Dhar added.

     Russia-Ukraine live updates U.S. prepares fresh sanctions; E.U. says Kremlin forces are in breakaway territories
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     China did not explicitly endorse Moscow’s latest moves over Ukraine but still recognized what it called Russia’s legitimate security concerns, in Beijing’s latest tightrope act over the crisis in Eastern Europe.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday called on all parties involved to “exercise restraint” and resolve the crisis through negotiation, in a phone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Antony J Blinken.
He still, however, referred to countries’ security concerns, a nod toward Russia’s views on Ukraine.
For China to support a Russian invasion of Ukraine would harm already deteriorating ties with Western nations, but Beijing is also keen to bolster its burgeoning relationship with Moscow to counter what China sees as U.S. efforts to suppress its rise as a global power.
At the start of the 2022 Winter Olympics and the two powers signed a joint statement pledging a strategic relationship of “no limits.” As the Ukraine crisis has escalated just after the close of the Winter Games, Beijing has joined Moscow in repeatedly criticizing the United States and NATO for provoking what it says are Russia’s “legitimate” security concerns.

     The West is Falling Victim to Russia's Psyops
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Preparing for a real war would involve Russia taking countermeasures against the inevitable, punitive Western response: moving money around to avoid asset freezes, and stockpiling imports that might be subject to Western sanctions.
Nonetheless, the horrendous prospect of Europe’s worst bloodletting since 1945 has prompted frenzied diplomatic efforts to head it off.
Gratitude that the catastrophe is, seemingly, averted means we forget about its instigator, while Putin cashes in a big geopolitical dividend.
Chiefly, Russia has framed the issue to legitimize its own security problems (read: neuroses) and put the onus on the West to accommodate them.
The phrase “Ukraine crisis” exemplifies this.

     Global Markets Fall After Russia Orders Troops Into Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Global stock indexes and U.S. futures fell, while crude-oil futures climbed after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into two breakaway areas of Ukraine that he had earlier recognized as independent.
On Tuesday, most-actively traded contracts for Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, rose 1.9% to $97.24 a barrel, according to FactSet, extending their recent run toward $100.
Bond yields fall as prices rise, and investors typically bid up the prices of safe-haven assets such as U.S. government bonds at times of stress.
Mr. Ichikawa said a Russian invasion of Ukraine would likely prompt strict economic sanctions from the U.S. and Europe, curbing international supplies of Russian oil.
In that scenario, “If oil prices rise sharply beyond $100, gasoline prices will rise in the U.S., and inflation will accelerate further, forcing the Fed to consider raising rates at a faster pace,” he said.

     Russia Is A Major Supplier Of Oil To The U.S.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     However, the U.S. also consumes far more oil (17.2 million BPD) than Russia (3.2 million BPD) or Saudi Arabia (3.5 million BPD).
The net result is that the U.S. is a net importer of crude oil, while Russia and Saudi Arabia are major crude oil exporters.
This also means that the U.S. economy is more vulnerable to oil price shocks, while higher oil prices are a net benefit to Russia and Saudi Arabia.
As of late 2021, the U.S. was importing 8.5 million BPD of crude oil from all countries.
Thus, Russia supplied 7% of U.S. crude oil imports in late 2021 – a significant number.

     Did Russia just invade Ukraine?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     “Otherwise, all responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine,” Putin said.
Russia has tens of thousands troops along different parts of the border with Ukraine.
Rep. Liz Cheney tweeted, “Russia has invaded Ukraine,” and Michael McFaul, who served as Obama’s ambassador to Russia, said the same.
Biden’s CIA director, William Burns, who served as ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008, had predicted that giving Ukraine NATO membership would “create fertile soil for Russian meddling in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.” (Ukraine isn’t part of NATO and was not expected to join anytime soon, but the country has deepened cooperation with the West since 2014).
In Monday’s speech and in a July 2021 essay, he claimed Ukraine is part of a “unified state” with Russia.
