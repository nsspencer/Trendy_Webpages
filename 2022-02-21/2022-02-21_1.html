     U.S. Offers Limited Initial Response to Russia as It Weighs Stiffer Sanctions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mr. Putin’s incremental approach to ratcheting up the pressure on Ukraine appears intended to exploit any fissures in what has been a quite unified NATO and European posture.
Some nations may be reluctant to reach for the most punishing sanctions if Mr. Putin’s forces remain in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, where Russia has exercised great influence during an eight-year conflict.
Yet the limited geographic reach of Mr. Putin’s initial claim on Ukrainian territory stood in sharp contrast to the implication in his winding, hourlong speech on Monday that the entire country was a part of Russia.
But it is unclear that Mr. Putin cares about the next round of sanctions, believing that his economy can withstand anything Mr. Biden and other Western leaders throw at him.
In his speech, he referred to Mr. Biden’s sanctions threats as “blackmail,” saying they would have been “put in place on Russia regardless of what happens in Ukraine.”“The purpose,” he argued, is “to keep Russia behind, to prevent it from developing.

     Crude oil storage tanks are seen from above at the Cushing oil hub, in Cushing, Oklahoma, March 24, 2016.
read more"The potential for a rally over $100 a barrel has received an enormous boost," said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude jumped $4.41, or 4.8%, to $95.48 versus Friday's settlement, having earlier reached $96, also the highest since 2014.
The crisis over Ukraine has added further support to an oil market that has surged due to tight supplies as demand recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.
Talks are ongoing on renewing Iran's nuclear agreement with world powers, which could eventually boost Iran's oil exports by over 1 million barrels per day.

     French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian speaks at an event in Paris, on Tuesday.
(Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty Images)The European Union will impose sanctions on Moscow following the “unacceptable” entry of Russian troops into the Donbas region of Ukraine, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Tuesday.
“Obviously we are going to initiate sanctions,” Le Drian said ahead of a meeting of European foreign ministers in Paris.
“It’s a violation of international law, it’s an attack on the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine, it’s Russia renouncing its international commitments and the Minsk accords that it had signed," Le Drian said.
EU High Representative Joseph Borrell said Tuesday morning that he had called an emergency informal meeting of EU foreign ministers to discuss Ukraine following a planned summit.

     Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said during an emergency session on Feb. 21 that Moscow had made similar moves in Georgia in 2008.
Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations, who requested the meeting, offered a defiant statement even as his country was surrounded by more than 150,000 Russian troops.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, also said Russia’s aggression belonged to another era.
“Putin wants the world to travel back in time to a time before the United Nations — to a time when empires ruled the world,” she said.
"The actions Russia has chosen today will have severe and far-reaching consequences,” said Barbara Woodward, Britain’s U.N. ambassador.

     The West is Falling Victim to Russia's Psyops
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Preparing for a real war would involve Russia taking countermeasures against the inevitable, punitive Western response: moving money around to avoid asset freezes, and stockpiling imports that might be subject to Western sanctions.
Nonetheless, the horrendous prospect of Europe’s worst bloodletting since 1945 has prompted frenzied diplomatic efforts to head it off.
Gratitude that the catastrophe is, seemingly, averted means we forget about its instigator, while Putin cashes in a big geopolitical dividend.
Chiefly, Russia has framed the issue to legitimize its own security problems (read: neuroses) and put the onus on the West to accommodate them.
The phrase “Ukraine crisis” exemplifies this.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     However, the U.S. also consumes far more oil (17.2 million BPD) than Russia (3.2 million BPD) or Saudi Arabia (3.5 million BPD).
The net result is that the U.S. is a net importer of crude oil, while Russia and Saudi Arabia are major crude oil exporters.
This also means that the U.S. economy is more vulnerable to oil price shocks, while higher oil prices are a net benefit to Russia and Saudi Arabia.
As of late 2021, the U.S. was importing 8.5 million BPD of crude oil from all countries.
Thus, Russia supplied 7% of U.S. crude oil imports in late 2021 – a significant number.

     “Otherwise, all responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine,” Putin said.
Russia has tens of thousands troops along different parts of the border with Ukraine.
Rep. Liz Cheney tweeted, “Russia has invaded Ukraine,” and Michael McFaul, who served as Obama’s ambassador to Russia, said the same.
Biden’s CIA director, William Burns, who served as ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008, had predicted that giving Ukraine NATO membership would “create fertile soil for Russian meddling in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.” (Ukraine isn’t part of NATO and was not expected to join anytime soon, but the country has deepened cooperation with the West since 2014).
In Monday’s speech and in a July 2021 essay, he claimed Ukraine is part of a “unified state” with Russia.
