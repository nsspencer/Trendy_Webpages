     U.S. Offers Limited Initial Response to Russia as It Weighs Stiffer Sanctions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mr. Putin’s incremental approach to ratcheting up the pressure on Ukraine appears intended to exploit any fissures in what has been a quite unified NATO and European posture.
Some nations may be reluctant to reach for the most punishing sanctions if Mr. Putin’s forces remain in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, where Russia has exercised great influence during an eight-year conflict.
Yet the limited geographic reach of Mr. Putin’s initial claim on Ukrainian territory stood in sharp contrast to the implication in his winding, hourlong speech on Monday that the entire country was a part of Russia.
But it is unclear that Mr. Putin cares about the next round of sanctions, believing that his economy can withstand anything Mr. Biden and other Western leaders throw at him.
In his speech, he referred to Mr. Biden’s sanctions threats as “blackmail,” saying they would have been “put in place on Russia regardless of what happens in Ukraine.”“The purpose,” he argued, is “to keep Russia behind, to prevent it from developing.

    </h2>

     Nikolai Fyodorovich is one of the few men allowed to cross the border into Russia from the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine.
His age -- he's 59 -- has spared him from the mobilization ordered by separatist leaders on Friday.
Nikolai Fyodorovich, who declined to give his full name, drove across the border at the Avilo-Uspenka crossing, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) from Donetsk's capital, on Sunday.
Last Friday, the leaders of the Russian-backed self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk republics -- which are not recognized by the West -- ordered the mass evacuation of women, children and the elderly, while barring men aged 18 to 55 from leaving.
Nikolai Fyodorovich said that he and his wife did not plan to stay in Russia and would return home to Donetsk the same day instead.

     What to watch for as Russia orders troops into eastern Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rather than providing long-sought answers about Putin's intentions and the global response to them, the moves opened up additional questions.
In a televised address after Putin's announcements, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine doesn't want war and won't fall for Putin's provocations — but also won't hand over the contested Donbas region in the east.
after Putin's announcements, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine doesn't want war and won't fall for Putin's provocations — but also won't hand over the contested Donbas region in the east.
If Russian troops approach or push beyond the "line of control" in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian forces would have to decide whether to pull back or stand and fight a military superpower.
But China has long stressed the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity — a point Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated Saturday when discussing Ukraine.

     Administration officials said additional measures — including more sanctions — would be announced Tuesday, though these would be separate from the strict measures promised if Moscow further invades Ukraine.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson will convene an emergency committee meeting Tuesday morning to agree on measures, which Downing Street officials described as “significant."
Biden’s order prohibits “new investment” by Americans, wherever they are located, into the separatist regions that call themselves the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic.
It’s not strong enough,” said Daniel Fried, a sanctions expert at the Atlantic Council and a former U.S. ambassador to Poland.

     Rosemary DiCarlo told Monday’s rare nighttime meeting of the UN Security Council that everyone involved should focus on ending hostilities immediately.
“The risk of major conflict is real and needs to be prevented at all costs,” she said at the Security Council meeting.
“We remain open to diplomacy for a diplomatic solution, however, allowing new bloodbath in the Donbas is something we do not intend to do,” Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council.
It was the third Security Council meeting on Ukraine in as many weeks.

     World leaders focus on how to punish Russia over UkraineIn this image provided by the United Nations, the U.N. Security Council meets for an emergency session on Ukraine, Monday, Feb. 21, 2022, at the U.N. headquarters.
Russia says it’s sending what it deems “peacekeepers” into eastern Ukraine, but the European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell stressed they were “troops” on sovereign Ukrainian territory.
A conflict could devastate Ukraine and cause huge economic damage across Europe, which is heavily dependent on Russian energy.
President Moon Jae-in instructed his officials to prepare for the economic fallout in South Korea if the Ukraine crisis worsens and U.S.-backed nations levy stringent economic sanctions on Russia.
NATO-member Turkey, which has close relations to both Ukraine and Russia, criticized Moscow’s decision to recognize the independence of the regions in eastern Ukraine.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Putin’s decision a “flagrant disrespect for international law and norms,” and noted the executive order is designed to prevent Russia from profiting off of the move.
The executive order followed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s lengthy televised address on Monday, when he laid out his decision to recognize the independence of the two breakaway regions.
That agreement was seen as the only way to settle the eight-year-long conflict in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine.
Biden held a series of meetings on Monday, first with his national security team as murmurs of Putin’s decision began to circulate.
The president also held calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, according to the White House.

     U.N. leaders condemn Putin after he orders 'peacekeepers' to UkraineEnlarge this image toggle caption TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized two regions in Ukraine as independent and ordered Russian troops to conduct "peacekeeping" operations there, raising fears that Russia is paving the way for an attack.
She warned that Putin's ambitions reach beyond Ukraine, and that he has asserted Russia's claims to all former territory of the former Russian Empire.
The Russian-backed rebel leaders of the self-proclaimed republics urged Putin earlier on Monday to recognize their independence and provide security guarantees.
Scholz said in a statement that he told Putin that any such move would amount to a one-sided breach of the Minsk agreements and urged Putin to pull Russian troops from the Ukraine-Russia border.
"Russian troops moving into the Donbas would not itself be a new step.
