     "Russia accounts for one in every 10 barrels of oil consumed globally, so it is a major player when it comes to the price of oil, and of course, it's really going to hurt consumers at the petrol pumps," she said.

     U.S. Offers Limited Initial Response to Russia as It Weighs Stiffer Sanctions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mr. Putin’s incremental approach to ratcheting up the pressure on Ukraine appears intended to exploit any fissures in what has been a quite unified NATO and European posture.
Some nations may be reluctant to reach for the most punishing sanctions if Mr. Putin’s forces remain in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, where Russia has exercised great influence during an eight-year conflict.
Yet the limited geographic reach of Mr. Putin’s initial claim on Ukrainian territory stood in sharp contrast to the implication in his winding, hourlong speech on Monday that the entire country was a part of Russia.
But it is unclear that Mr. Putin cares about the next round of sanctions, believing that his economy can withstand anything Mr. Biden and other Western leaders throw at him.
In his speech, he referred to Mr. Biden’s sanctions threats as “blackmail,” saying they would have been “put in place on Russia regardless of what happens in Ukraine.”“The purpose,” he argued, is “to keep Russia behind, to prevent it from developing.

     Russia-Ukraine live updates U.S. prepares fresh sanctions; E.U. says Kremlin forces are in breakaway territories
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The breakaway regions are at the heart of the crisis between Ukraine and Russia; Western leaders have feared Russia would recognize them as independent of Ukraine to create a pretext for invasion.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement the Biden administration will respond swiftly, having anticipated this move from Russia.
The recognition of the two separatist territories in #Ukraine is a blatant violation of international law, the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the #Minsk agreements.
The EU and its partners will react with unity, firmness and with determination in solidarity with Ukraine.
Putin’s announcement came shortly after Russia’s Security Council on Monday called for him to recognize the breakaway territories, which since 2014 have self-declared as the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic.

     U.N. leaders condemn Putin after he orders 'peacekeepers' to UkraineEnlarge this image toggle caption TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized two regions in Ukraine as independent and ordered Russian troops to conduct "peacekeeping" operations there, raising fears that Russia is paving the way for an attack.
She warned that Putin's ambitions reach beyond Ukraine, and that he has asserted Russia's claims to all former territory of the former Russian Empire.
The Russian-backed rebel leaders of the self-proclaimed republics urged Putin earlier on Monday to recognize their independence and provide security guarantees.
Scholz said in a statement that he told Putin that any such move would amount to a one-sided breach of the Minsk agreements and urged Putin to pull Russian troops from the Ukraine-Russia border.
"Russian troops moving into the Donbas would not itself be a new step.

     China strikes a different tone as the West condemns Russia over Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Beijing is navigating a complex position as the crisis in Ukraine intensifies, attempting to balance deepening ties with Moscow with its practiced foreign policy of staunchly defending state sovereignty.
China always makes its own position according to the merits of the matter itself.
Amid growing condemnation, Russia has sought to draw closer to China, with Putin traveling to Beijing on February 4 to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping ahead of the Winter Olympics.
According to a readout from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Wang expressed “concern” about the situation in Ukraine.
“China is concerned about [the] evolution of situation in Ukraine” and “legitimate security concerns of any country should be respected,” Wang said during the call.
