     U.S. Offers Limited Initial Response to Russia as It Weighs Stiffer Sanctions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mr. Putin’s incremental approach to ratcheting up the pressure on Ukraine appears intended to exploit any fissures in what has been a quite unified NATO and European posture.
Some nations may be reluctant to reach for the most punishing sanctions if Mr. Putin’s forces remain in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, where Russia has exercised great influence during an eight-year conflict.
Yet the limited geographic reach of Mr. Putin’s initial claim on Ukrainian territory stood in sharp contrast to the implication in his winding, hourlong speech on Monday that the entire country was a part of Russia.
But it is unclear that Mr. Putin cares about the next round of sanctions, believing that his economy can withstand anything Mr. Biden and other Western leaders throw at him.
In his speech, he referred to Mr. Biden’s sanctions threats as “blackmail,” saying they would have been “put in place on Russia regardless of what happens in Ukraine.”“The purpose,” he argued, is “to keep Russia behind, to prevent it from developing.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Beijing is navigating a complex position as the crisis in Ukraine intensifies, as it attempts to balance deepening ties with Moscow with its practiced foreign policy of staunchly defending state sovereignty.
In a brief statement at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council Monday night, China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun said Beijing welcomed and encouraged every effort for a diplomatic solution, adding that all concerns should be treated on the "basis of equality."
"The current situation in Ukraine is the result of many complex factors.
China always makes its own position according to the merits of the matter itself.
We believe that all countries should solve international disputes by peaceful means in line with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter," Zhang said.

     Vladimir Putin Has Officially Ordered Russian Troops Into Eastern Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     DNIPRO, Ukraine — Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into eastern Ukraine Monday, authorizing an invasion that threatens a large-scale military conflict and could put thousands of lives in danger.
Ukraine’s government currently has no presence in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and it is unclear if Putin moving troops in and annexing them would be considered an invasion of Ukraine by Western allies.
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US Ambassador to the UN, derided Putin calling his troops "peacekeepers."
An invasion of Ukraine unleashes the forces of war, death and destruction on the people of Ukraine."
Ukraine's member said, “the internally recognized borders of Ukraine will remain unchangeable," and that is views Russia's moves as "violations of the sovereignty and territory of Ukraine."

     The West is Falling Victim to Russia's Psyops
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Preparing for a real war would involve Russia taking countermeasures against the inevitable, punitive Western response: moving money around to avoid asset freezes, and stockpiling imports that might be subject to Western sanctions.
Nonetheless, the horrendous prospect of Europe’s worst bloodletting since 1945 has prompted frenzied diplomatic efforts to head it off.
Gratitude that the catastrophe is, seemingly, averted means we forget about its instigator, while Putin cashes in a big geopolitical dividend.
Chiefly, Russia has framed the issue to legitimize its own security problems (read: neuroses) and put the onus on the West to accommodate them.
The phrase “Ukraine crisis” exemplifies this.

     White House wrestles with whether Russia has ‘invaded’ Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Biden administration sought to hit back at Russia’s aggressive action while stopping short of declaring that it had officially invaded Ukraine, which would have triggered the array of hard-hitting sanctions President Biden has been warning about for months.
Russia has increasingly suggested, with little evidence, that residents of those regions are under threat from the Ukrainian military.
Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized the West and referred to Ukraine as “a colony” in a televised address on Feb. 21.
“Call it what it is — an invasion.”Bremmer said that what played out publicly Monday was the United States backing down from its previous threat to impose severe sanctions if Russia entered Ukraine.
(AP)Blinken had been tentatively scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday, provided that Russia did not invade Ukraine.

We have reason to believe that,” Biden said Friday at the White House.

     “Otherwise, all responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine,” Putin said.
Russia has tens of thousands troops along different parts of the border with Ukraine.
Rep. Liz Cheney tweeted, “Russia has invaded Ukraine,” and Michael McFaul, who served as Obama’s ambassador to Russia, said the same.
Biden’s CIA director, William Burns, who served as ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008, had predicted that giving Ukraine NATO membership would “create fertile soil for Russian meddling in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.” (Ukraine isn’t part of NATO and was not expected to join anytime soon, but the country has deepened cooperation with the West since 2014).
In Monday’s speech and in a July 2021 essay, he claimed Ukraine is part of a “unified state” with Russia.
