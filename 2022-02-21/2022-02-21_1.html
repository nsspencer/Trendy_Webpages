     U.S. Offers Limited Initial Response to Russia as It Weighs Stiffer Sanctions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mr. Putin’s incremental approach to ratcheting up the pressure on Ukraine appears intended to exploit any fissures in what has been a quite unified NATO and European posture.
Some nations may be reluctant to reach for the most punishing sanctions if Mr. Putin’s forces remain in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, where Russia has exercised great influence during an eight-year conflict.
Yet the limited geographic reach of Mr. Putin’s initial claim on Ukrainian territory stood in sharp contrast to the implication in his winding, hourlong speech on Monday that the entire country was a part of Russia.
But it is unclear that Mr. Putin cares about the next round of sanctions, believing that his economy can withstand anything Mr. Biden and other Western leaders throw at him.
In his speech, he referred to Mr. Biden’s sanctions threats as “blackmail,” saying they would have been “put in place on Russia regardless of what happens in Ukraine.”“The purpose,” he argued, is “to keep Russia behind, to prevent it from developing.

     Russia-Ukraine live updates U.S. prepares fresh sanctions; E.U. says Kremlin forces are in breakaway territories
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Administration officials said additional measures — including more sanctions — would be announced Tuesday, though these would be separate from the strict measures promised if Moscow further invades Ukraine.
Britain is also preparing new sanctions.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson will convene an emergency committee meeting Tuesday morning to agree on measures, which Downing Street officials described as “significant."
Biden’s order prohibits “new investment” by Americans, wherever they are located, into the separatist regions that call themselves the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic.
It’s not strong enough,” said Daniel Fried, a sanctions expert at the Atlantic Council and a former U.S. ambassador to Poland.

     Condemnation for Putin at U.N. as he orders 'peacekeepers' to UkraineEnlarge this image toggle caption TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized two regions in Ukraine as independent and ordered Russian troops to conduct "peacekeeping" operations there, raising fears that Russia is paving the way for an attack.
She warned that Putin's ambitions reach beyond Ukraine, and that he has asserted Russia's claims to all former territory of the former Russian Empire.
The Russian-backed rebel leaders of the self-proclaimed republics urged Putin earlier on Monday to recognize their independence and provide security guarantees.
Scholz said in a statement that he told Putin that any such move would amount to a one-sided breach of the Minsk agreements and urged Putin to pull Russian troops from the Ukraine-Russia border.
"Russian troops moving into the Donbas would not itself be a new step.

     As the West condemns Russia over Ukraine, Beijing strikes a different tone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Beijing is navigating a complex position as the crisis in Ukraine intensifies, attempting to balance deepening ties with Moscow with its practiced foreign policy of staunchly defending state sovereignty.
"The current situation in Ukraine is the result of many complex factors.
"China's embrace of Russia will invite further pushback from the United States and Europe that it wants to avoid."
According to a readout from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Wang expressed "concern" about the situation in Ukraine.
"China is concerned about [the] evolution of situation in Ukraine" and "legitimate security concerns of any country should be respected," Wang said during the call.
