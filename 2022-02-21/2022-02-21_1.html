     James Gunn and ‘Peacemaker’ actress Jennifer Holland are engaged
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     'Peacemaker' director James Gunn and actress Jennifer Holland are getting married.
MANILA, Philippines – James Gunn is ready to tie the knot with Hollywood actress Jennifer Holland!
In an Instagram post on Sunday, February 20, Gunn shared a photo of Holland sipping from a mug while showing off a diamond ring on her left finger.
Gunn, 55, and Holland, 35, started dating in 2015.
They also worked together in several projects – Holland played Emilia Harcourt in The Suicide Squad movie and HBO Max’s Peacemaker series.

     U.S. Offers Limited Initial Response to Russia as It Weighs Stiffer Sanctions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Mr. Putin’s incremental approach to ratcheting up the pressure on Ukraine appears intended to exploit any fissures in what has been a quite unified NATO and European posture.
Some nations may be reluctant to reach for the most punishing sanctions if Mr. Putin’s forces remain in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, where Russia has exercised great influence during an eight-year conflict.
Yet the limited geographic reach of Mr. Putin’s initial claim on Ukrainian territory stood in sharp contrast to the implication in his winding, hourlong speech on Monday that the entire country was a part of Russia.
But it is unclear that Mr. Putin cares about the next round of sanctions, believing that his economy can withstand anything Mr. Biden and other Western leaders throw at him.
In his speech, he referred to Mr. Biden’s sanctions threats as “blackmail,” saying they would have been “put in place on Russia regardless of what happens in Ukraine.”“The purpose,” he argued, is “to keep Russia behind, to prevent it from developing.

     Live updates: Ukraine-Russia crisis

     A man holds the remains of a mortar which exploded in front of a building in the town of Schastia, Ukraine, on February 22.
(Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images)Two Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 12 others injured in shelling by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine on Monday, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday in a statement.
The ministry said the Ukrainian Defense Forces recorded 84 ceasefire violations on Monday, 64 of which involved weapons prohibited by the 2015 Minsk Peace agreement.
The authorities in the breakaway republics persistently claim shelling by Ukrainian forces, who in turn regularly deny firing artillery across the front lines.
On Saturday, the EU condemned the "use of heavy weaponry and indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas," saying they constituted a "clear violation of the Minsk agreements and international humanitarian law."

     Russia-Ukraine live updates Russia says recognition of separatist areas includes territory held by Ukrainian forces; Germany halts major gas pipeline

     Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said during an emergency session on Feb. 21 that Moscow had made similar moves in Georgia in 2008.
Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations, who requested the meeting, offered a defiant statement even as his country was surrounded by more than 150,000 Russian troops.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, also said Russia’s aggression belonged to another era.
“Putin wants the world to travel back in time to a time before the United Nations — to a time when empires ruled the world,” she said.
"The actions Russia has chosen today will have severe and far-reaching consequences,” said Barbara Woodward, Britain’s U.N. ambassador.

     End hostilities immediately, Russia told at late-night UN meeting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rosemary DiCarlo told Monday’s rare nighttime meeting of the UN Security Council that everyone involved should focus on ending hostilities immediately.
“The risk of major conflict is real and needs to be prevented at all costs,” she said at the Security Council meeting.
“We remain open to diplomacy for a diplomatic solution, however, allowing new bloodbath in the Donbas is something we do not intend to do,” Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council.
It was the third Security Council meeting on Ukraine in as many weeks.
The body has met dozens of times to discuss the Ukraine crisis since Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014.

     We have anticipated a move like this from Russia and are ready to respond immediately.
President Biden will soon issue an Executive Order that will prohibit new investment, trade, and financing by U.S. persons to, from, or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine.
will also provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to operate in those areas of Ukraine.
We will also soon announce additional measures related to today’s blatant violation of Russia’s international commitments.

     What to watch for as Russia orders troops into eastern Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Rather than providing long-sought answers about Putin's intentions and the global response to them, the moves opened up additional questions.
In a televised address after Putin's announcements, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine doesn't want war and won't fall for Putin's provocations — but also won't hand over the contested Donbas region in the east.

If Russian troops approach or push beyond the "line of control" in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian forces would have to decide whether to pull back or stand and fight a military superpower.
But China has long stressed the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity — a point Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated Saturday when discussing Ukraine.

     U.N. leaders condemn Putin after he orders 'peacekeepers' to UkraineEnlarge this image toggle caption TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized two regions in Ukraine as independent and ordered Russian troops to conduct "peacekeeping" operations there, raising fears that Russia is paving the way for an attack.
She warned that Putin's ambitions reach beyond Ukraine, and that he has asserted Russia's claims to all former territory of the former Russian Empire.
The Russian-backed rebel leaders of the self-proclaimed republics urged Putin earlier on Monday to recognize their independence and provide security guarantees.
Scholz said in a statement that he told Putin that any such move would amount to a one-sided breach of the Minsk agreements and urged Putin to pull Russian troops from the Ukraine-Russia border.
"Russian troops moving into the Donbas would not itself be a new step.

     World leaders focus on how to punish Russia over UkraineIn this image provided by the United Nations, the U.N. Security Council meets for an emergency session on Ukraine, Monday, Feb. 21, 2022, at the U.N. headquarters.
Russia says it’s sending what it deems “peacekeepers” into eastern Ukraine, but EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell stressed they were “troops” on sovereign Ukrainian territory.
A conflict could devastate Ukraine and cause huge economic damage across Europe, which is heavily dependent on Russian energy.
President Moon Jae-in instructed his officials to prepare for the economic fallout in South Korea if the Ukraine crisis worsens and U.S.-backed nations levy stringent economic sanctions on Russia.
NATO-member Turkey, which has close relations to both Ukraine and Russia, criticized Moscow’s decision to recognize the independence of the regions in eastern Ukraine.

     U.S. sanctions Russia for declaring independence of eastern Ukraine territories
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Putin’s decision a “flagrant disrespect for international law and norms,” and noted the executive order is designed to prevent Russia from profiting off of the move.
The executive order followed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s lengthy televised address on Monday, when he laid out his decision to recognize the independence of the two breakaway regions.
That agreement was seen as the only way to settle the eight-year-long conflict in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine.
Biden held a series of meetings on Monday, first with his national security team as murmurs of Putin’s decision began to circulate.
The president also held calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, according to the White House.
