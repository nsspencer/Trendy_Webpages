     Veteran guard Goran Dragic to sign with Brooklyn Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Goran Dragic plans to sign with Brooklyn, giving the Nets a veteran boost in the backcourt.
Agent Bill Duffy said Monday that Dragic was going to Brooklyn, where the Nets need guard help after trading James Harden to Philadelphia.
Dragic played in just five games this season in Toronto, where he was traded from Miami in the offseason in the deal for Kyle Lowry.
His plans to sign with the Nets were first reported by The Athletic.
Dragic was an All-Star in Miami in 2018 and helped the Heat reach the NBA Finals two years later.

     Nets signing Goran Dragic in free agency: Sources

     The Brooklyn Nets are signing free-agent guard Goran Dragic, sources tell The Athletic.
Dragic will reunite with his former Phoenix Suns teammate and Nets coach Steve Nash in Brooklyn.
Dragic entered free agency after the San Antonio Spurs bought out his contract following his trade from the Toronto Raptors earlier this month.
The Raptors sent Dragic to San Antonio ahead of the NBA trade deadline in exchange for power forward Thaddeus Young, center Drew Eubanks and draft picks.
In five games with the Raptors, Dragic averaged eight points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists.

     Fantasy Basketball Week 19: Chris Paul, Goran Dragic highlight list of players to watch ahead of Thursday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There won't be any NBA basketball until Thursday this week, but that doesn't mean there's not plenty for Fantasy managers to do following All-Star weekend.
Phoenix's star point guard will be re-evaluated in 6-8 weeks and could miss the rest of the regular season if his condition doesn't improve quickly.
The Suns' backcourt rotation will need to pick up a lot of slack with the league's fifth-ranked Fantasy point guard out of commission.
He notched 19 points, four rebounds, and six assists in his lone start for Phoenix this year.
The Trail Blazers waived Dennis Smith Jr., so Portland's new starting point guard has a great chance to stay hot in March.

     Goran Dragic is signing with the Brooklyn Nets now that he has secured a buyout from the San Antonio Spurs, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania.
Dragic played just five games as a Raptor before leaving the team for personal reasons.
He was dealt to San Antonio on Feb. 10 (trade deadline day), but the rebuilding Spurs had no need for his services.
In Dragic, the Nets have given themselves an insurance policy against Irving's absence and Simmons' postseason problems.
No other contender could offer Dragic the minutes and touches that Brooklyn can due to Irving's unique circumstances.
