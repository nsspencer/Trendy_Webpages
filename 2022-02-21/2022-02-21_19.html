     Stocks Decline as Biden Proposes Russia Sanctions: Markets Wrap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stocks fell, pushing the S&amp;P 500 into a correction, as the imposition of sanctions against Russia over its Ukraine militancy put further stress on a market that has shown signs of buckling over the Federal Reserve’s efforts to subdue inflation.
The S&amp;P 500 declined 1%, bringing its losses from a January high to 10%, as investors weighed the potential damage from sanctions targeting Russia’s elite and sovereign debt abroad.
The European Union and U.K. also signaled they are ready to impose further penalties unless Putin changes course.
However, the Russian president has denied plans to invade Ukraine.

     Nets signing Goran Dragic in free agency: Sources

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Brooklyn Nets are signing free-agent guard Goran Dragic, sources tell The Athletic.
Dragic will reunite with his former Phoenix Suns teammate and Nets coach Steve Nash in Brooklyn.
Dragic entered free agency after the San Antonio Spurs bought out his contract following his trade from the Toronto Raptors earlier this month.
The Raptors sent Dragic to San Antonio ahead of the NBA trade deadline in exchange for power forward Thaddeus Young, center Drew Eubanks and draft picks.
In five games with the Raptors, Dragic averaged eight points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists.

     U.S. stock-index futures were sharply lower early Tuesday, but off the worst levels overnight, when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the deployment of troops to separatist areas within Ukraine, after recognizing their independence, a move that some fear puts Ukraine and Russia one step closer to military conflict.
Markets in the U.S. were closed in observance of Presidents Day and trade on Tuesday will provide the first opportunity for investors to react to developments in Eastern Europe.
Markets were set for big losses on Tuesday as Putin ordered forces Monday to “maintain peace” in separatist regions of eastern Ukraine.
The announcement raised fears, which have kept investors skittish, that an invasion was about to materialize.

     Ukraine-Russia crisis: Stock futures tank as situation escalates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Presidents Day holiday in the U.S. provided little mental relief for traders as the situation between Russia and Ukraine intensified, sending stock futures plunging Tuesday morning.
The U.S. holiday — along which came closed markets for trading Monday — brought several negative developments on the Ukraine-Russia front.
Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the deployment of Russian troops to two breakaway regions of Ukraine.
Sky News reported that U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will unveil a "significant" package of sanctions on Russia Tuesday morning.
U.S. President Joe Biden will impose new sanctions on trade and financing in the two territories recognized by Putin, CNN reported.

     U.S. stock-index futures were sharply lower early Tuesday, but off the worst levels overnight, when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the deployment of troops to separatist areas within Ukraine, after recognizing their independence, a move that some fear puts Ukraine and Russia one step closer to military conflict.
Markets in the U.S. were closed in observance of Presidents Day and trade on Tuesday will provide the first opportunity for investors to react to developments in Eastern Europe.
Markets were set for big losses on Tuesday as Putin ordered forces Monday to “maintain peace” in separatist regions of eastern Ukraine.
The announcement raised fears, which have kept investors skittish, that an invasion was about to materialize.
