     Tulsi Gabbard calls Kamala Harris' Russia marks 'embarrassing': This is not rocket science
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former Democratic Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard slammed the Biden administration Monday on "Hannity," calling out Kamala Harris’ "embarrassing" Russia remarks and saying the Vide President does not have the temperament to be the voice of the United States on the world stage.
TULSI GABBARD: This is embarrassing.
It’s clear she [Kamala Harris] was sent there to be the voice of the United States as a purely political calculation.
She has no concept of the cost of war nor does she have the temperament necessary to be the voice of the United States on the global stage.
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have said we are going to incur a cost.

     The Conservative Political Action Conference announced Monday that Tulsi Gabbard will headline the event’s annual Ronald Reagan Dinner this weekend in Orlando, Florida.
Gabbard, who ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has recently been highly critical of President Joe Biden and liberal lawmakers.
According to The Daily Beast, “Having a popular Democrat speak at the group’s main dinner, to be held Friday, is an ‘extraordinary event,’ said a spokeswoman.
Two hours after this was posted, the dinner sold out, said CPAC boss Matt Schlapp.”Screenshot/2022CPAC is an annual political conference and a marquee event for Republicans, especially presidential candidates.
Featured speakers this year include Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Florida Gov.

     Tulsi Gabbard Isn't the First Democrat to Speak at CPAC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Gabbard, who unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, has become increasingly critical of her party.
While it's uncommon for a Democrat to speak at CPAC, Gabbard's appearance isn't a complete shock given her criticism of President Joe Biden, and at least three other Democrats have spoken at the conference.
One of possibly the most surprising Democrats to appear at CPAC was CNN commentator Van Jones, who took the stage in 2019.
A vocal critic of former President Donald Trump and Republicans, Jones praised conservatives for their work on criminal justice reform.
While Gabbard endorsed Biden in 2020 after dropping out of the presidential race, she has also been a vocal critic of the president.

     2020 Democratic hopeful Tulsi Gabbard joins CPAC speaking roster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, once a champion of left-leaning causes like Medicare-for-All, gun control and campaign finance reform is now joining the roster of speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference, better known as CPAC.
Ms Gabbard did not issue her own statement on Monday morning as the news was announced by CPAC and its various representatives.
Ms Gabbard is a veteran and was known for her anti-war stance during the 2020 Democratic primary, where she was largely overshadowed by bigger-name candidates such as Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren.
Despite finishing the race with zero delegates, Ms Gabbard did enjoy some national prominence during the race including after a confrontation with now-Vice President Kamala Harris over Ms Harris’s criminal justice policy record.
To supposedly protect a ‘democracy’ that really isn’t a democracy; to distract from domestic failures/show how tough Biden is.

     Tulsi Gabbard to Speak at CPAC, Joining Its ‘Great Un-Wokening’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Tulsi Gabbard, the former Hawaii congresswoman who sought the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, is completing her metamorphosis from iconoclast progressive to hardcore conservative by appearing as a featured guest at the Trumpy love-in known as the Conservative Political Action Conference.
CPAC 2022 begins Wednesday in Orlando, where Gabbard will join a roster of GOP loyalists — including Florida Gov.
According to the conference agenda, Gabbard will appear at the Friday night “Ronald Reagan Dinner,” where the keynote speaker is the former Fox News star conspiracy theorist Glenn Beck.
Gabbard launched her 2020 campaign with an apology for her past anti-LGBTQ views and closed it with a robust endorsement of Joe Biden for president, speaking to her affection for his late son Beau.
Now he promises to choose Supreme Court nominee on the same criteria.
