     LJ Cryer: Status of Baylor guard for game against Oklahoma State on Monday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     7 Baylor Bears will hit the road to face the Oklahoma State Cowboys on Monday and guard LJ Cryer is listed as questionable for the matchup with a foot injury.
Cryer ended up sitting out of Saturday’s 72-62 victory over TCU.
Cryer has been battling injuries throughout a chunk of Big 12 play and has barely been on the court in the month of February.
Through 19 games this season, he’s been an effective scoring threat for the reigning national champs with an average of 13.5 points per game.
Right now at DraftKings Sportsbook the Bears are listed as a 4.5-point favorite, whereas the opening line was set at -5.

     OSU vs. Baylor men's basketball: Three takeaways from the Cowboys' overtime loss to the Bears
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     The Cowboys (13-14, 6-9 Big 12) were 0.2 seconds from the season sweep of the national champions.
Oklahoma State men's basketball schedule:How to watch the Cowboys in 2021-22 NCAA seasonCold to red hotOSU’s offense got off to a very poor start.
The Cowboys hit their final 15 of 21 shots in the first half, including 9 of their last 10, to rally for the lead.
Baylor, with primarily a seven-man rotation, turned to the zone in the second half and stifled the Cowboys’ offense much like teams did in the non-conference schedule.
The Cowboys shot just 27% in the second half, falling behind late in the half.
