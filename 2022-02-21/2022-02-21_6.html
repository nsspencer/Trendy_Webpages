     Courteney Cox Says Cosmetic Surgery Left Her Looking “Strange”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Courteney Cox, best known for portraying Monica Geller in Friends, has opened up about her struggle with cosmetic surgery.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Style Cox stated: “There was a time when you go, “Oh, I’m changing.
I’m looking older.” And I tried to chase that [youthfulness] for years.
Reliving the turning point, she said: “I’d say, the day you realise what your friends were talking about.
That’s just crazy.’” Now, Cox has dissolved her fillers and is opting for a more natural approach.
