     Vladimir Putin Has Officially Ordered Russian Troops Into Eastern Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     DNIPRO, Ukraine — Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into eastern Ukraine Monday, authorizing an invasion that threatens a large-scale military conflict and could put thousands of lives in danger.
Ukraine’s government currently has no presence in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and it is unclear if Putin moving troops in and annexing them would be considered an invasion of Ukraine by Western allies.
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US Ambassador to the UN, derided Putin calling his troops "peacekeepers."
An invasion of Ukraine unleashes the forces of war, death and destruction on the people of Ukraine."
Ukraine's member said, “the internally recognized borders of Ukraine will remain unchangeable," and that is views Russia's moves as "violations of the sovereignty and territory of Ukraine."

     OnPolitics: What does Russian President Vladimir Putin really want?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian President Vladimir Putin Monday signed three decrees recognizing the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, two breakway regions of eastern Ukraine.
"We have anticipated a move like this from Russia and are ready to respond immediately," Psaki said.
The order is separate from promised sanctions Biden said he would impose on Moscow should Russia invade Ukraine.
Putin remains an enigma even as he takes center stage in the current conflict facing eastern Europe.
But for reasons known primarily to him, an undeterred Putin seeks to lash the nations together by force.

     Russian President Vladimir Putin ups ante in crisis by recognizing Ukraine’s rebels
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian President Vladimir Putin moved quickly on Monday to recognize the independence of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, framing his show of defiance against the West in a series of nationally televised appearances that came amid Western fears of Russian invasion in Ukraine.
Immediately after the pro-Russian leaders of Ukraine’s separatist “people’s republics” were shown on Russian TV pleading with Putin to acknowledge them as independent states, Putin chaired a Kremlin meeting Monday in which a lineup of senior Russian officials all backed the move.
Hours later, Putin spoke in an hour-long televised address to the nation and then was shown on TV signing the recognition decrees.
The rebels have charged than a sharp increase in skirmishes heralded Ukraine’s intention to reclaim control of the region by force.
They followed up Monday by asking Putin to recognize their regions’ independence, setting stage for the Kremlin’s political show.

     Putin orders 'peacekeeping' troops to Ukraine after recognizing breakaway regionsEnlarge this image toggle caption Alexey Nikolsky/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images Alexey Nikolsky/Sputnik/AFP via Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized two regions in Ukraine as independent and ordered Russian troops to conduct "peacekeeping" operations there, raising fears that Russia is paving the way for an attack.
Russia is one of the countries with veto power in the council and no statement or action from the Security Council is likely.
The U.S. has said Russia has amassed up to 190,000 troops on its border with Ukraine.
Scholz said in a statement that he told Putin that any such move would amount to a one-sided breach of the Minsk agreements and urged Putin to pull Russian troops from the Ukraine-Russia border.
"Russian troops moving into the Donbas would not itself be a new step.

Russia’s recognition of the republics could give him a pretext to send military forces to Ukraine, given his claims that Kyiv forces are attacking the areas.
Ukrainian officials Monday repeatedly denied the attacks, and Western officials have warned that Moscow is manufacturing a reason to invade.

     Putin orders troops into pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered troops into separatist-held parts of eastern Ukraine in what the Kremlin called a "peacekeeping" mission, just hours after he signed decrees recognizing the independence of the Moscow-backed regions.
"Ukraine has never had traditions of its own statehood," he said, calling the eastern part of the country "ancient Russian lands."
The decrees signed by Putin conveyed Moscow's official recognition over two breakaway territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine -- the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic (DPR and LPR).
But it will be met with severe and coordinated economic response that I've discussed in detail with our allies, as well as laid out very clearly for President Putin."
The increase in combative language from Putin came as tensions grow in eastern Ukraine.
