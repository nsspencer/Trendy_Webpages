    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Longtime sports analyst and noted Michigan alum Rich Eisen gave his take on Sunday’s postgame fight between Wolverines coach Juwan Howard and Wisconsin assistant Joe Krabbenhoft.
“I‘m a Michigan guy and people want to know what I think, and if you don‘t here it comes anyway,” Eisen said during the opening of his show on Monday.
“Juwan Howard shouldn’t have thrown anything.
That’s the end of it.”Discipline is pending for Howard, whose actions are currently under review by the Big Ten as of Sunday afternoon.
Howard is 56–28 in three seasons at Michigan, though the Wolverines sit just 14–11 this season.

(0:56)Michigan men's basketball coach Juwan Howard has been suspended five games -- the remainder of the regular season -- and fined $40,000 for hitting Wisconsin assistant coach Joe Krabbenhoft in the face after Sunday's game, the Big Ten Conference announced on Monday.
Wisconsin coach Greg Gard was fined $10,000 but not suspended, while Krabbenhoft is not expected to receive punishment.
Krabbenhoft then came over in the middle of the scrum and exchanged words with Howard, then Howard reached out and struck Krabbenhoft's face.
I would like to personally apologize to Wisconsin's Assistant Coach Joel Krabbenhoft and his family, too.

     EAST LANSING — Tom Izzo sat in a meeting Sunday afternoon with his three Michigan State basketball freshmen when Mike Garland burst into the room.
I was worried more about my team and my players,” Izzo said Monday.
He said he didn’t know first-hand what caused Wolverines coach Juwan Howard to confront Badgers coach Greg Gard and then hit Wisconsin assistant Joe Krabbenhoft.
He added he might call both Howard and Gard to find out more details of what happened.
But he also did not want to comment on that without finding out from Howard and Gard.

     Now that the dust has settled a bit and we’ve Zapruder’d the film of the melee in Madison from multiple angles, everyone’s got an opinion on what happened on Sunday afternoon, who was right and who was wrong.
There are multiple schools of thought now: the prevailing one being Juwan Howard was very much in the wrong for striking a Wisconsin assistant coach, both others recognize that there was unique provocation.
Then there’s all the banter about the initial instigation, whether it be the Michigan press or the Wisconsin timeout.
With that in mind, here are the myriad reactions to Juwan Howard’s actions on Sunday at the Kohl Center.

     The sports world is buzzing with reaction to the postgame fight involving Michigan and Wisconsin on Sunday.
On Monday, the Big Ten announced penalties for the brawl, including a five game suspension and $40,000 fine for Michigan coach Juwan Howard.
In addition Wisconsin coach Greg Gard was fined $10,000 for violating the conference's sportsmanship policy, but was not suspended.
But as for the two-most visible participants — Howard and Gard — proportion seems like the most important element.
Whatever punishment Howard gets, Gard's should be considerably less.
