     When this twisty thriller opens, the FBI believes it’s secured “the most dangerous woman in the world,” international arms dealer Elena Federova (Morena Baccarin, above), in a black site.
“Elena orchestrated the entire thing to take down some corrupt members of the U.S. government,” Baccarin explains.

     'The Endgame' makes the right moves in its cop-criminal chess match
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Having enjoyed its share of success with "The Blacklist" and various imitators, NBC treads similar terrain with "The Endgame," whose major wrinkle and upgrade involves casting Morena Baccarin (icily similar to her early "V" role) as a mysterious femme fatale.
Slickly made and fast paced, it makes for an enjoyable thriller, although it's a dice roll as to how long that can last.
"You've messed with the wrong woman," Elena informs her captors, later warning them, "Don't poke the tiger with a short stick."
Although the big brass are predictably clueless, one agent, Val Turner ("First Wives Club's" Ryan Michelle Bathé), has a history with Federova, recognizing the scope of the plot.
Yet she comes with baggage in the form of her disgraced husband, while clearly representing the only person on the other side of the chessboard that the criminal mastermind respects.

     NBC’s ‘The Endgame’ Depends Upon a Criminal Queen With Almost Too Many Answers to Be Compelling: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Say this for “The Endgame”: It knows what it has in Morena Bacarrin, an actor so immediately telegenic that making sure she has everyone’s attention is as simple as her walking into a room.
As notorious mastermind Elena Federova, Baccarin commands her every scene in NBC’s newest drama with a sly grin and slightly raised eyebrow that usually spells disaster for those trying to test her.
For “The Endgame,” however, Elena and Val feel like the kind of aggressive women characters that men write when trying to upend their own expectations.
It all looks quite sleek and impressive, but even after just two episodes, Elena’s ability to pull off the impossible out of nowhere begins to get old.
“The Endgame” premieres Monday, February 21 at 10 pm on NBC.

     ‘The Endgame’: NBC’s Action-Packed Series Stars Two Women of Color, but That Should Not Define It
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Stars Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathé spoke to IndieWire about fronting the international heist crime drama.
That’s why NBC’s new series, “The Endgame,” starring Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathé, is notable.
That they are women does mean something to the series.
“I also think that we’re willing to not let [the fact that we’re women] be in the background, but to be there somewhere informing the series.
“It’s hard because the reality of things is I’m still sorting it out because I’m blackity Black, Black, Black, and I’m used to bringing so much of that to the characters that I play because there is no one way to be Black,” she said.

     NBC’s ‘The Endgame’: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s not that I can’t see why NBC would be interested in The Endgame as a pilot.
The plot has superficial similarities to shows like The Blacklist and Blindspot, which have been staples of NBC’s schedule for years.
The Endgame The Bottom Line Inevitable endgame: cancellation.
The Endgame pilot is bad and the second episode offers no evidence of course correction to make things better, so I’m prepared to move on, even if NBC wasn’t.
The endgame for my review, though, is to do what NBC’s development process failed to do: spare viewers from an obvious dud.

Check, check!
The potential is there, but the rest of The Endgame needs to reach the register at which Baccarin is thriving.
Still, Baccarin keeps The Endgame exciting, and she and Ronin are having so much fun that it’s infectious.
But if what you see is what you get, then Baccarin makes The Endgame more entertaining than it has any right to be.
