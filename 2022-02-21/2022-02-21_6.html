     Vladimir Putin Has Officially Ordered Russian Troops Into Eastern Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     DNIPRO, Ukraine — Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into eastern Ukraine Monday, authorizing an invasion that threatens a large-scale military conflict and could put thousands of lives in danger.
After a frenzied day of failed diplomacy, the Russian president recognized the "independence" of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions — two areas that are not independent but belong to Ukraine and were taken by Russia during a war it started eight years ago.
The mission could put regular Russian military forces in direct armed conflict with Ukrainian forces, raising the prospect of a larger invasion of Ukraine that Western governments have warned could trigger a wide-scale humanitarian crisis and cause barely-trained civilians to take up arms and defend their country.
Ukraine’s government currently has no presence in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and it is unclear if Putin moving troops in and annexing them would be considered an invasion of Ukraine by Western allies.
"This is nonsense, we know what they really are," she said, adding that the troops “create a pretext for a further invasion of Ukraine.”

     Russian President Vladimir Putin ups ante in crisis by recognizing Ukraine’s rebels
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian President Vladimir Putin moved quickly on Monday to recognize the independence of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, framing his show of defiance against the West in a series of nationally televised appearances that came amid Western fears of Russian invasion in Ukraine.
Immediately after the pro-Russian leaders of Ukraine’s separatist “people’s republics” were shown on Russian TV pleading with Putin to acknowledge them as independent states, Putin chaired a Kremlin meeting Monday in which a lineup of senior Russian officials all backed the move.
Hours later, Putin spoke in an hour-long televised address to the nation and then was shown on TV signing the recognition decrees.
The rebels have charged than a sharp increase in skirmishes heralded Ukraine’s intention to reclaim control of the region by force.
They followed up Monday by asking Putin to recognize their regions’ independence, setting stage for the Kremlin’s political show.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Russian President Vladimir Putin Monday signed three decrees recognizing the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, two breakway regions of eastern Ukraine.
"We have anticipated a move like this from Russia and are ready to respond immediately," Psaki said.
The order is separate from promised sanctions Biden said he would impose on Moscow should Russia invade Ukraine.
Putin remains an enigma even as he takes center stage in the current conflict facing eastern Europe.
But for reasons known primarily to him, an undeterred Putin seeks to lash the nations together by force.

Ukrainian officials Monday repeatedly denied the attacks, and Western officials have warned that Moscow is manufacturing a reason to invade.

     Putin orders troops into pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine CNN —Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered troops into separatist-held parts of eastern Ukraine in what the Kremlin called a “peacekeeping” mission, just hours after he signed decrees recognizing the independence of the Moscow-backed regions.
Separatists in eastern Ukraine have long had substantial backing from the Kremlin, with the US, NATO and Ukrainian officials saying Moscow supplies them with advisory support and intelligence, and embeds its own officers in their ranks.
Kyiv and the West maintain that the region is part of Ukrainian territory, although the Ukrainian government asserts the two regions have been in effect Russian-occupied since 2014, when the conflict in eastern Ukraine began.
Putin also accused the West of threats and blackmail during the previously unscheduled convening of the Russian security council that, in an unusually theatrical setting, was shown on television.
