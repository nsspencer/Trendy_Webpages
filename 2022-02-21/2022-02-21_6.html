     Street Fighter 6 Announced, And Ryu Is Wearing Sandals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Capcom’s countdown site has ended and has announced Street Fighter 6.
You can watch the debut teaser trailer below in which Ryu faces off against Luke :Mildly observant fans will notice that in other Street Fighter games, Ryu is barefoot.
Here’s the Street Fighter Wiki’s roundup on the character’s stance on shoes:According to some of his Street Fighter IV win quotes, Ryu can afford shoes, but prefers walking barefoot (possibly for comfort).
Now, Ryu did wear red shoes in the first Street Fighter game, so he’s not completely adverse to the concept of them.
What other Ryu character development does Street Fighter 6 hold?

     Street Fighter 6 teaser puts Ryu and Luke at center stage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Capcom has officially announced that the next mainline entry in the Street Fighter series, Street Fighter 6, is in the works.
The game was announced at the end of the Capcom Pro Tour, Capcom’s global Street Fighter tournament series, with a very short teaser.
The latest release in the Street Fighter series, Street Fighter 5, went through five years of ups and downs, ending with a final DLC character named Luke who Capcom claims represents the future of the series.
Luke is featured in the Street Fighter 6 teaser front and center alongside the series’ poster boy, Ryu, who is shown to be moving on to his bearded “Sexy Ryu” look that was introduced as an alternate in SF5.
While the trailer gives a small glimpse at who we can expect to headline the story and a confirmation that Luke is indeed the new series protagonist as Street Fighter 5 teased, that’s really all that was shown.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Capcom has now made Street Fighter 6 official, and released its first teaser trailer.
Will Street Fighter 6, like its predecessor, remain a PlayStation console exclusive?
As expected, Capcom's mysterious countdown timer revealed the trailer early this morning, coinciding with the season finale of Capcom's Street Fighter Pro tour.
If you're unfamiliar with Luke, he arrived as DLC for Street Fighter 5 back in November last year.
At the time, Capcom dubbed him "the future of Street Fighter" and a "major" part of the next Street Fighter game.
