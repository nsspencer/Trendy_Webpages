     'The Endgame' makes the right moves in its cop-criminal chess match
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Having enjoyed its share of success with "The Blacklist" and various imitators, NBC treads similar terrain with "The Endgame," whose major wrinkle and upgrade involves casting Morena Baccarin (icily similar to her early "V" role) as a mysterious femme fatale.
Slickly made and fast paced, it makes for an enjoyable thriller, although it's a dice roll as to how long that can last.
"You've messed with the wrong woman," Elena informs her captors, later warning them, "Don't poke the tiger with a short stick."
Although the big brass are predictably clueless, one agent, Val Turner ("First Wives Club's" Ryan Michelle Bathé), has a history with Federova, recognizing the scope of the plot.
Yet she comes with baggage in the form of her disgraced husband, while clearly representing the only person on the other side of the chessboard that the criminal mastermind respects.

     NBC's The Endgame Premiere: Grade the Cat-and-Mouse Thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NBC’s The Endgame series premiere begins with criminal mastermind Elena Federova (played by Gotham‘s Morena Baccarin) being detained in a giant box, out of which she exits wearing a fabulous blue gown.
Meanwhile, Federal Agent Val Turner (All Rise‘s Ryan Michelle Bathé) is visiting her fed husband Owen (Rosewood‘s Kamal Angelo Bolden) in prison, where he’s serving a 10-year sentence for taking drug money.
Elena doesn’t say much about the revelation that she’s a mother, except that her and Sergey’s child is safe.
— “for power, for revenge, for something as simple as love.” Speaking of love, Sergey’s not dead, as believed!
The attorney informs Val that Elena has evidence that can prove Owen’s innocence in exchange for Val’s help with a certain matter.

     NBC’s ‘The Endgame’ Depends Upon a Criminal Queen With Almost Too Many Answers to Be Compelling: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Say this for “The Endgame”: It knows what it has in Morena Bacarrin, an actor so immediately telegenic that making sure she has everyone’s attention is as simple as her walking into a room.
As notorious mastermind Elena Federova, Baccarin commands her every scene in NBC’s newest drama with a sly grin and slightly raised eyebrow that usually spells disaster for those trying to test her.
For “The Endgame,” however, Elena and Val feel like the kind of aggressive women characters that men write when trying to upend their own expectations.
It all looks quite sleek and impressive, but even after just two episodes, Elena’s ability to pull off the impossible out of nowhere begins to get old.
“The Endgame” premieres Monday, February 21 at 10 pm on NBC.

     NBC’s ‘The Endgame’: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s not that I can’t see why NBC would be interested in The Endgame as a pilot.
The plot has superficial similarities to shows like The Blacklist and Blindspot, which have been staples of NBC’s schedule for years.
The Endgame The Bottom Line Inevitable endgame: cancellation.
The Endgame pilot is bad and the second episode offers no evidence of course correction to make things better, so I’m prepared to move on, even if NBC wasn’t.
The endgame for my review, though, is to do what NBC’s development process failed to do: spare viewers from an obvious dud.

I think Val has to put it on the back burner because there’s lives to be saved.
When you’re first starting out, you have this sense—particularly when you have a certain training, and particularly when you start becoming an actor—it’s like: “I can do anything; I’m gonna do anything!

The episode is about Elena and Val, but it's orchestrated by Elena.
She's going to be shown a lot of flaws to the system she's loyal to.
Each one of these episodes will have Elena talk someone down and give us another piece of Elena's plan.
It's not just baddies, they all did something very specific and it's part of the revelation of the series going forward.
