     Morena Baccarin Previews ‘The Endgame’: ‘This Is Not Your Typical Rivalry’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     When this twisty thriller opens, the FBI believes it’s secured “the most dangerous woman in the world,” international arms dealer Elena Federova (Morena Baccarin, above), in a black site.
“Elena orchestrated the entire thing to take down some corrupt members of the U.S. government,” Baccarin explains.
See Also 'The Endgame' Puts a Twist on the Cat-and-Mouse Thriller The new NBC drama focuses on the relationship between Morena Baccarin's international criminal and Ryan Michelle Bathe's FBI agent.
She wants to convince Val they are on the same side,” Baccarin hints.

     'The Endgame' makes the right moves in its cop-criminal chess match
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Having enjoyed its share of success with "The Blacklist" and various imitators, NBC treads similar terrain with "The Endgame," whose major wrinkle and upgrade involves casting Morena Baccarin (icily similar to her early "V" role) as a mysterious femme fatale.
Slickly made and fast paced, it makes for an enjoyable thriller, although it's a dice roll as to how long that can last.
"You've messed with the wrong woman," Elena informs her captors, later warning them, "Don't poke the tiger with a short stick."
Although the big brass are predictably clueless, one agent, Val Turner ("First Wives Club's" Ryan Michelle Bathé), has a history with Federova, recognizing the scope of the plot.
Yet she comes with baggage in the form of her disgraced husband, while clearly representing the only person on the other side of the chessboard that the criminal mastermind respects.

     NBC's The Endgame Premiere: Grade the Cat-and-Mouse Thriller
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     NBC’s The Endgame series premiere begins with criminal mastermind Elena Federova (played by Gotham‘s Morena Baccarin) being detained in a giant box, out of which she exits wearing a fabulous blue gown.
Meanwhile, Federal Agent Val Turner (All Rise‘s Ryan Michelle Bathé) is visiting her fed husband Owen (Rosewood‘s Kamal Angelo Bolden) in prison, where he’s serving a 10-year sentence for taking drug money.
Elena doesn’t say much about the revelation that she’s a mother, except that her and Sergey’s child is safe.
— “for power, for revenge, for something as simple as love.” Speaking of love, Sergey’s not dead, as believed!
The attorney informs Val that Elena has evidence that can prove Owen’s innocence in exchange for Val’s help with a certain matter.

     NBC’s ‘The Endgame’ Depends Upon a Criminal Queen With Almost Too Many Answers to Be Compelling: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Say this for “The Endgame”: It knows what it has in Morena Bacarrin, an actor so immediately telegenic that making sure she has everyone’s attention is as simple as her walking into a room.
As notorious mastermind Elena Federova, Baccarin commands her every scene in NBC’s newest drama with a sly grin and slightly raised eyebrow that usually spells disaster for those trying to test her.
For “The Endgame,” however, Elena and Val feel like the kind of aggressive women characters that men write when trying to upend their own expectations.
It all looks quite sleek and impressive, but even after just two episodes, Elena’s ability to pull off the impossible out of nowhere begins to get old.
“The Endgame” premieres Monday, February 21 at 10 pm on NBC.

Each one of these episodes will have Elena talk someone down and give us another piece of Elena's plan.

     Stars Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathé spoke to IndieWire about fronting the international heist crime drama.
That’s why NBC’s new series, “The Endgame,” starring Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathé, is notable.
That they are women does mean something to the series.
“I also think that we’re willing to not let [the fact that we’re women] be in the background, but to be there somewhere informing the series.
“It’s hard because the reality of things is I’m still sorting it out because I’m blackity Black, Black, Black, and I’m used to bringing so much of that to the characters that I play because there is no one way to be Black,” she said.

     Morena Baccarin Is the Spark That Brings The Endgame to Life
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There are cozy-comfort shows and put-on-while-cooking shows; watch-with-your-partner shows and cheat-on-your-partner-by-watching-ahead shows; holiday-family-discussion shows and middle-America shows; meme-able shows and theorizing-on-Reddit shows.
Check, check!
The potential is there, but the rest of The Endgame needs to reach the register at which Baccarin is thriving.
Still, Baccarin keeps The Endgame exciting, and she and Ronin are having so much fun that it’s infectious.
But if what you see is what you get, then Baccarin makes The Endgame more entertaining than it has any right to be.
