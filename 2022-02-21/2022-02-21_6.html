     Paul Farmer, Pioneer of Global Health, Dies at 62
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Paul Farmer, a physician and anthropologist who sought to bring high-quality health care to some of the world’s poorest people, died on Monday in Rwanda.
Partners in Health, the global public health organization that Dr. Farmer co-founded, announced his death in a statement that did not specify the cause.
Dr. Farmer previously lived in Rwanda and spent decades focused on improving its health care system.
Dr. Farmer gained public renown thanks largely to “Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, a Man Who Would Cure the World,” a 2003 book by Tracy Kidder.
