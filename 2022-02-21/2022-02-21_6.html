Beckel was fired from Fox in 2017 for allegedly making an inappropriate remark to an African American employee.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     (CNN) Having enjoyed its share of success with "The Blacklist" and various imitators, NBC treads similar terrain with "The Endgame," whose major wrinkle and upgrade involves casting Morena Baccarin (icily similar to her early "V" role) as a mysterious femme fatale.
Slickly made and fast paced, it makes for an enjoyable thriller, although it's a dice roll as to how long that can last.
"You've messed with the wrong woman," Elena informs her captors, later warning them, "Don't poke the tiger with a short stick."
Although the big brass are predictably clueless, one agent, Val Turner ("First Wives Club's" Ryan Michelle Bathé), has a history with Federova, recognizing the scope of the plot.
Yet she comes with baggage in the form of her disgraced husband, while clearly representing the only person on the other side of the chessboard that the criminal mastermind respects.

     NBC’s The Endgame series premiere begins with criminal mastermind Elena Federova (played by Gotham‘s Morena Baccarin) being detained in a giant box, out of which she exits wearing a fabulous blue gown.
Meanwhile, Federal Agent Val Turner (All Rise‘s Ryan Michelle Bathé) is visiting her fed husband Owen (Rosewood‘s Kamal Angelo Bolden) in prison, where he’s serving a 10-year sentence for taking drug money.
Elena doesn’t say much about the revelation that she’s a mother, except that her and Sergey’s child is safe.
— “for power, for revenge, for something as simple as love.” Speaking of love, Sergey’s not dead, as believed!
The attorney informs Val that Elena has evidence that can prove Owen’s innocence in exchange for Val’s help with a certain matter.

     NBC’s ‘The Endgame’: TV Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     It’s not that I can’t see why NBC would be interested in The Endgame as a pilot.
The plot has superficial similarities to shows like The Blacklist and Blindspot, which have been staples of NBC’s schedule for years.
The Endgame The Bottom Line Inevitable endgame: cancellation.
The Endgame pilot is bad and the second episode offers no evidence of course correction to make things better, so I’m prepared to move on, even if NBC wasn’t.
The endgame for my review, though, is to do what NBC’s development process failed to do: spare viewers from an obvious dud.

     The Endgame Morena Baccarin as Elena Federova | Credit: Eric Liebowitz/NBCENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Elena spends the entire pilot in one room.
The episode is about Elena and Val, but it's orchestrated by Elena.
She's going to be shown a lot of flaws to the system she's loyal to.
Each one of these episodes will have Elena talk someone down and give us another piece of Elena's plan.
It's not just baddies, they all did something very specific and it's part of the revelation of the series going forward.

     Morena Baccarin Is the Spark That Brings The Endgame to Life
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     There are cozy-comfort shows and put-on-while-cooking shows; watch-with-your-partner shows and cheat-on-your-partner-by-watching-ahead shows; holiday-family-discussion shows and middle-America shows; meme-able shows and theorizing-on-Reddit shows.
Check, check!
The potential is there, but the rest of The Endgame needs to reach the register at which Baccarin is thriving.
Still, Baccarin keeps The Endgame exciting, and she and Ronin are having so much fun that it’s infectious.
But if what you see is what you get, then Baccarin makes The Endgame more entertaining than it has any right to be.

     When this twisty thriller opens, the FBI believes it’s secured “the most dangerous woman in the world,” international arms dealer Elena Federova (Morena Baccarin, above), in a black site.
“Elena orchestrated the entire thing to take down some corrupt members of the U.S. government,” Baccarin explains.
