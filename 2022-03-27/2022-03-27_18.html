“Sam and I go back, in theater, to the Negro Ensemble Company, because of a pretty good play, A Solider’s Story,” said Washington from the Ray Dolby Ballroom.
These are—and there’s a few of them—the organizations that Samuel L. Jackson and his wife LaTanya Jackson give to: Alzheimer’s Association, American Institute for Stuttering, American Red Cross, Artists for a New South Africa, Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, Black Economic Alliance…” said Washington.
What happened next was a testament to the dual icon’s 40 year plus friendship as each man embraced each other as only true brothers could.
