     Chris Wallace Says Life at Fox News Became ‘Unsustainable’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Before, I found it was an environment in which I could do my job and feel good about my involvement at Fox,” Mr. Wallace said of his time at the network.
“And since November of 2020, that just became unsustainable, increasingly unsustainable as time went on.”Still, he acknowledged that some viewers may wonder why he did not leave earlier.
Mr. Wallace said his new CNN+ series, which airs at 6 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, was inspired by the work of famed interviewers like Larry King and Charlie Rose.
The set of the show is sparse, just Mr. Wallace and a guest sitting on either side of a Plexiglas table — a more brightly lit version of Mr. Rose’s long-running PBS format.
The service, which costs $6 a month, debuts on Tuesday, years after the arrival of streaming competitors like Fox Nation and the CBS News Streaming Network.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Wallace says he left Fox News after people at the news organization began to question matters of truth, like the Jan. 6 riot and whether the 2020 election was stolen.
“I just no longer felt comfortable with the programming at Fox," Wallace told The New York Times in an interview published Sunday.
“I’m fine with opinion: conservative opinion, liberal opinion,” Wallace told The Times.
“Some people might have drawn the line earlier, or at a different point,” Wallace told The Times.
“I think the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions,” Wallace told Trump.

     Summary: Sign up for the free Mother Jones newsletterIn a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times, former Fox News anchor Chris Wallace explained his decision to leave the conservative network last December after 18 years.
“Before, I found it was an environment in which I could do my job and feel good about my involvement at Fox,” Wallace told media correspondent Michael Grynbaum.
Moderating presidential debates and hosting the network’s flagship political talk show “Fox News Sunday,” he was considered a more middle-of-the-road presence.
“I just no longer felt comfortable with the programming at Fox,” Wallace said in his interview.
“I’m fine with opinion: conservative opinion, liberal opinion,” Wallace said.

     Chris Wallace On His Move To CNN+: “No Longer Felt Comfortable With The Programming At Fox”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Wallace spent nearly two decades at Fox News before shifting to the new streaming service, CNN+.
Wallace claimed Fox News shifted in the months following Donald Trump’s defeat in 2020.
He was also taken aback by Fox host Tucker Carlson’s take on the Jan. 6 uprising, and was disturbed by Carlson’s documentary, Patriot Purge, which defended the insurrection.
As a result, “I just no longer felt comfortable with the programming at Fox,” Wallace said.
“Before, I found it was an environment in which I could do my job and feel good about my involvement at Fox,” Wallace said of his time at the network.
