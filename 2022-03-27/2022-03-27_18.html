     Troy Kotsur wins supporting actor Oscar for ‘CODA’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES, March 27 (Reuters) – Troy Kotsur became the first deaf man to win an Oscar, taking the Academy Award on Sunday for best supporting actor for his role as a fisherman and father in family drama “CODA.”Kotsur, 53, has worked for over three decades in theater, television and film for both deaf and hearing audiences.
In “CODA,” an acronym for “child of deaf adults,” Kotsur plays Frank Rossi, the father of teenager Ruby who struggles to help her family’s fishing business while pursuing her own aspirations in music.
The only other deaf person to win an Oscar was Kotsur’s “CODA” co-star Marlee Matlin.
Kotsur earned the supporting actor honor over Ciaran Hinds for “Belfast,” J.K. Simmons for “Being the Ricardos” and Kodi Smit-McPhee and Jesse Plemons, both nominated for their roles in “The Power of the Dog.

     Summary: LOS ANGELES (AP) — Troy Kotsur won the best supporting actor Oscar for his role in “CODA.”Kotsur on Sunday night became the second actor who is deaf to win an Academy Award.
Troy Kotsur’s road to making history at the OscarsIn his Oscar-winning performance in “CODA,” Kotsur has one spoken line, but it’s a good one.
Kotsur remembers watching Matlin become the first deaf actor to win an Oscar, in 1987 for “Children of a Lesser God.”“I felt like I could have hope as a deaf actor,” Kotsur remembered in an interview by Zoom from his home in Mesa, Arizona, through an interpreter.
With few opportunities in television and film available for deaf actors, Kotsur found freedom on the stage.
This process doesn’t end until the moment the curtain goes up on opening night.”On stage, Kotsur honed the full-body physicality of his acting.
