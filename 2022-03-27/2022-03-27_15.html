     Summary: A full-skirted ball gown or other expected red carpet look, however, was never a consideration for DeBose’s Oscar night experience, according to the styling duo, known as Zadrian + Sarah.
The look is finished with a dramatic coat that draped from DeBose’s elbows and matching shoes by Valentino Garavani.
Ariana DeBose Mike Coppola/Getty ImagesThe LGBTQ+ actress agrees wholeheartedly with her styling duo about the nontraditional strategy.
“The look that I’m wearing and the designer is a reflection of that; it shows me as myself in every way.
DeBose’s look is likewise a reflection of those values, stretching the boundaries of both gender and haute couture.
