     Regina Hall Reveals Whether Oscars Nominees Will Approve of Host Jokes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here's hoping that the 2022 Oscar nominees have a good sense of humor!
Regina Hall, Wanda Sykes and Amy Schumer are not entirely roasting this year's nominees—at least, that's what Regina says.
"It's been three years with no host," Regina said, "we don't want anybody to go home or have to flinch in their chair.
And in a separate interview, Wanda added that they've done their due diligence to ensure the night is a success.
"We have had a good time in rehearsals and we are working hard on it," the Other Two star promised, "making sure that we give everyone a good show."

     Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes on Hosting the Oscars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And asked how they would top Glenn Close doing “Da Butt” at last year’s Oscars, Sykes had an idea: “We’re going to try to get Judi Dench to do the Worm.”These are edited excerpts from our interview.
WANDA SYKES If they had come to me and said, hey, do you want to host the Oscars by yourself, I would have said hell no, absolutely not.
REGINA HALL I was excited that Will Packer and Shayla Cowan were at the helm.
But then when I heard Wanda, I thought, “Wait a minute — now that sounds fun.” And then Amy.
I don’t think that things have to move completely smoothly to be wonderful.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amy Schumer, Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes joined forces to host the 2022 Oscars on Sunday, March 27.
Introduced by DJ Khaled, the trio of funny women spoke to the star-studded audience at Los Angeles’ Dolby Theater and they sure had a lot to say.
“This year the Academy hired three women to host because it’s cheaper than hiring one man,” Schumer, 40, said.
The “Inside Amy Schumer” star also took a swipe at “Being the Ricardos.”“The innovation to make a movie about Lucille Ball without even a moment that’s funny,” Schumer said.
“Not your fault, Nicole [Kidman] — you’re great.”Follow the 2022 Oscars with our up-to-the-minute coverage:Before they signed off — and Schumer took the mic on her own — Sykes took a swipe at Florida’s controversial “Don’t Say Gay” bill.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actor Regina Hall and Emmy-winning comedians Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes are co-hosting the show with plans to bring their edgy humor and lots of fun to the often overstuffed ceremony.
The last woman to host the ceremony was Ellen DeGeneres, who did it to relatively rave reviews back in 2014.

Hall, Schumer and Sykes have said to “expect the unexpected,” which is hard to do with something as formulaic as Hollywood’s marquee event.
We just want to have this night,’” Schumer said on “The Drew Barrymore Show” last week.
