     Liza Minnelli and Lady Gaga Were the 2022 Oscars’ Ultimate Power Couple
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sunday night’s final award for Best Picture was presented by Lady Gaga, whose appearance was always going to make for a moment given her snub for Best Actress.
Instead she brought bonafide Hollywood royalty on stage with her in the form of Liza Minnelli to announce the evening’s biggest winner, CODA.
As far as the public knows, despite both being the definition of icons (not to mention, specifically, gay icons) Gaga and Minnelli didn’t have a relationship prior to Sunday evening’s ceremony.
Though, in 2019 Minnelli acknowledged Gaga’s reprisal of her mother Judy Garland’s role in the original 1954 A Star Is Born with apparent amusement.
“[Garland] would have laughed, and then she would have gotten into it,” Minnelli told Entertainment Tonight in 2019.

     Lady Gaga and Liza Minnelli Bring Tenderness To A Tense Oscars Ceremony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lady Gaga and Liza Minnelli shared a moment in the spotlight at this year’s Oscars when the two icons were tapped to present the award for Best Picture at the end of the ceremony.
The ceremony by this point was full of heightened emotions after an unexpected conflict between Chris Rock and Will Smith led Smith to slap Rock on stage.
Smith later won the Best Actor statue for King Richard, delivering a highly personal speech through tears.
All that drama would be a hard enough act to follow, but with Minnelli having difficulty delivering her lines, the moment added to the evening’s anxious vibe.
By the end of the evening, that’s just the vibe we needed.
