     Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes on Hosting the Oscars

     Summary: And asked how they would top Glenn Close doing “Da Butt” at last year’s Oscars, Sykes had an idea: “We’re going to try to get Judi Dench to do the Worm.”These are edited excerpts from our interview.
WANDA SYKES If they had come to me and said, hey, do you want to host the Oscars by yourself, I would have said hell no, absolutely not.
REGINA HALL I was excited that Will Packer and Shayla Cowan were at the helm.
But then when I heard Wanda, I thought, “Wait a minute — now that sounds fun.” And then Amy.
I don’t think that things have to move completely smoothly to be wonderful.

“This year the Academy hired three women to host because it’s cheaper than hiring one man,” Schumer, 40, said.
The “Inside Amy Schumer” star also took a swipe at “Being the Ricardos.”“The innovation to make a movie about Lucille Ball without even a moment that’s funny,” Schumer said.
