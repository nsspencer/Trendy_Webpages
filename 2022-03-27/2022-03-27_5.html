It's a historic win for a film that brings Deaf culture, and Deaf actors, to the forefront.
Written and directed by Sian Heder, CODA is based on the 2014 French film La Famille Bélier.
Distributed by Apple TV+, it is also the first best picture win for a streaming service.
Eight of the ten Best Picture nominees were available on streaming services in the weeks leading up to the award ceremony.

     Sian Heder, Director of ‘CODA’ Wins At The 2022 Oscars For Best Adapted Screenplay
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sian Heder brought the Oscar audience to its feet winning her first Academy Award for adapting CODA (Child Of Deaf Adult), from the 2014 French film La famille Bélier written by Victoria Bedos.
During her acceptance speech (accompanied by an ASL interpreter), she talks about the process of getting the film made.
The director then acknowledges that the journey to getting this film where it is today, started at Sundance 2021.
“I want to thank Sundance for starting this journey.
Heder wanted to make a film like this CODA at a very young age upon meeting her father’s assistant, who was a CODA herself (Child of Deaf Adults).

     Oscars 2022: How ‘CODA’ won best picture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not Apple TV+, which became the first streaming service to win the best picture Oscar.
Matlin’s unshakable faith notwithstanding, “CODA” stands as one of the most unlikely best picture winners in the history of the Oscars.
“CODA” earned three in all, including for Heder and Kotsur, a low total for a best picture contender.
(1932’s “Grand Hotel” was the last movie to win best picture without at least one of these noms.)
By the end of February, those omissions seemed to matter a bit less when “CODA” won the film ensemble honor at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.

     How CODA Came From Behind to Win Best Picture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Oscar for Best Picture, which for months had seemed entirely locked up, was suddenly, surprisingly, up for grabs.
AdvertisementAdvertisementFor decades the Academy has toggled back and forth between the heart film and the art film in its Best Picture selections.
That’s why, as the Oscars approached, I found myself delighted at the idea of either Power of the Dog or CODA winning Best Picture.
After all, what good is it to give Best Picture to a big hit if that big hit doesn’t actually show off Hollywood at its best?
Well, the good news is that this year, at least, Best Picture came down to two movies that people cared about quite a lot, even if most of the viewership took place at home.

     Apple's Oscar-winner CODA brings you into an inner world of sign
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oscar-winner Troy Kotsur, one of the stars of Apple's movie CODA, is known as a great signer.
It has as many scenes in American Sign Language as those in spoken English.
And during singular moments of CODA, the film lets sign speak for itself.
Voicing the word "ejaculation" in a movie wouldn't force the MPA to slap an R rating on a movie, Heder argued.
When Ruby can't figure out how to explain it in her second language, English, she turns to her first language, sign, to answer.
