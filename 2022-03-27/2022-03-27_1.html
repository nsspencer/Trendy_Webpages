     Summary: CODA's Troy Kotsur is now the first Deaf man to win an Oscar for actingEnlarge this image toggle caption Neilson Barnard/Getty Images Neilson Barnard/Getty ImagesTroy Kotsur is now the first man who is Deaf to win an Academy Award for acting, collecting the trophy for best actor in a supporting role.
His CODA costar, Marlee Matlin, was the first Deaf actor to win an Oscar back in 1987, receiving the best actress award for Children of a Lesser God.
"This is dedicated to the Deaf community, the CODA community and the disabled community," Kotsur signed in his acceptance speech.
In the film, Kotsur plays Frank Rossi, a fisherman in Gloucester, Mass., and the patriarch of a family whose wife and son are also Deaf.
He studied acting at Gallaudet University in Washington D.C., then toured with The National Theatre of the Deaf.

     Deaf family drama 'CODA' gains momentum as Oscars best picture contender
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EMBED &gt;More News Videos Award winning actor Troy Kotsur says many children of deaf adults, or "CODA," have thanked him for the movie because now they feel seen, too.
LOS ANGELES -- After scoring top prizes at prestigious award shows, best picture nominee "CODA" is picking up steam after scoring awards for best supporting actor and best adapted screenplay at the 2022 Oscars.
"In his speech, Kotsur thanked the deaf theater companies who fostered him as an actor, and President Joe Biden, who invited the "CODA" cast for a tour of the White House last Tuesday.
"This was an independent film and it was incredibly hard to get made," Heder said during her acceptance speech for best adapted screenplay.
If "CODA" wins, it will be the first time since 1932's "Grand Hotel" that a film with fewer than four nominations took best picture.

     It was a smash hit at Sundance. Will ‘CODA’ pull off a history-making upset at the Oscars?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When “CODA” had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival last year, it didn’t get thunderous applause or a standing ovation from the crowd.
And unlike the 2014 award-winning French film it is based on, “CODA” director Sian Heder actually cast deaf actors in her film.
“I hope that this opens the door to people getting that audiences want to see these kinds of stories,” Heder said while accepting the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival.
Beyond the awards, though, the film — which features a mostly deaf cast — is proving to be groundbreaking in terms of representation.
Not relegated to the background, like we’ve ticked this box.”But although the cast is mostly deaf, “CODA” isn’t just about deafness.

     Road to the Oscars: CODA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Siân Heder adapted the French film, La Famille Belier (2014) into an undeniably sweet American remake, titled CODA (Child of Deaf Adults).
Both of her parents, Frank (Troy Kotsur) and Jackie (Marlee Matlin), as well as her older brother Leo (Daniel Durant) are deaf.
One thing to appreciate about CODA is the inclusion of actual deaf actors, which makes it feel all the more authentic.
CODA is sweet, and the inclusion of the deaf community is much appreciated, but the familiar story doesn’t do it any favors.
Compared to other Oscar-nominated movies, CODA just doesn’t approach that level of quality and craft required to compete against something like Dune or The Power of the Dog, given that its only real strength relies on the unique family dynamic and ensemble chemistry.

     Summary: She decides her dream is music, something her deaf family — according to the film — could never understand.
But despite phenomenal performances by all the actors, "CODA" isn't the movie deaf and Hard of Hearing people have been waiting for.
The premise of "CODA" is troubling on paper: A deaf family whose hearing kid sings (cue the rimshot)!
But this movie is touted and celebrated as a "deaf" movie.
But "CODA" is not a movie by deaf people, and I would argue it's not for those of us who are deaf, either.

     Summary: Oscar-winner Troy Kotsur, one of the stars of Apple's movie CODA, is known as a great signer.
It has as many scenes in American Sign Language as those in spoken English.
And during singular moments of CODA, the film lets sign speak for itself.
Voicing the word "ejaculation" in a movie wouldn't force the MPA to slap an R rating on a movie, Heder argued.
When Ruby can't figure out how to explain it in her second language, English, she turns to her first language, sign, to answer.

     Summary: No matter the language, it's easy to understand love, and Troy Kotsur's Oscar-nominated performance in "CODA" has captured the hearts of audiences.
But when Kotsur was 17, his dad was hit by a drunk driver and paralyzed from the neck down.
"My father was unable to sign or communicate with me any longer," Kotsur said on the podcast through an ASL interpreter.
He's married to his wife Jackie (Matlin), and they have two kids: Leo (Daniel Durant) and Ruby (Emilia Jones).
"It means that our peers are accepting our work as artists not because we're deaf, we're just actors who happen to be deaf.
