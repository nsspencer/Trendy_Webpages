     Summary: The Oscars 2022 is doing something a bit different when it comes to the host: Regina Hall, Wanda Sykes, and Amy Schumer are sharing the spotlight.
Ahead of the 94th Academy Awards, Sykes said that they’d be opening the show together “and then you’ll see different variations of hosts.
When Sykes’ time on the stage alone came, it was about an hour in, to show off the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.
Then, as the show neared the two-hour mark, Sykes took the stage as Richard Williams (from King Richard) and Hall followed … as Venus Williams as Tammy Faye.
