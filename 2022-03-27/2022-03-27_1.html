     On Mother’s Day - treasured memories of an inspirational woman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mother (I always called her Mother, not Mum) was a joyous woman.
Even as her health deteriorated because of the brain tumour, and medics and the family seemed to impose a raft of rules on her, she remained rebellious.
My love for mountains and nature is her love for mountains and nature.
I can never comprehend what it’s like to have a brain tumour, even with all those years Mother fought one.
But on Mother’s Day, I implore everyone who has lost their mum, to dig deep into themselves and know that even if it sounds like a cliché, their mum is not truly gone.

     Summary: For some of the bereaved, the torrent of promotional Mother’s Day emails at this time of year is more upsetting than the day itself.
This is certainly the case for Kristian Glynn, whose wife, the accomplished journalist Sarah Hughes, died of cancer last April aged 48.
Of much greater significance will be the joyful launch at the end of this month of the book Hughes was writing when she died.
Sarah Hughes, who died in April 2021.
One particular passage, in an essay by Hughes about memory, closely echoes Glynn’s sentiments about Mother’s Day.
