     2022 Oscar Winners: Complete List
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “CODA,” once an underdog, could defy early expectations and take home Hollywood’s top prize.
(Though they will each have a tough time outpacing Will Smith, a king in his own way.)
Campion, Steven Spielberg, Paul Thomas Anderson, Ryusuke Hamaguchi and Kenneth Branagh will compete for the directing prize.
Campion is the favorite, and a win for her would make this year the first time that the best director Oscar has gone to women twice in a row.
The best actress race, perhaps the most wide-open of the top categories, is between Jessica Chastain, Olivia Colman, Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Kristen Stewart.

     Oscars 2022 Live Updates: Follow Every Twist and Turn of the Race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The one consistent rumor we’ve been hearing over the past few days of events is that Penélope Cruz, once considered a longshot nominee for her work in Parallel Mothers, could be the one to win in best actress.
She hasn’t been nominated anywhere else, which makes it impossible to gauge how much support there is— but reporters on the campaign trail say they keep hearing from Academy members who voted for her.
It would be Cruz’s second win, having taken home best supporting actress for Vicky Cristina Barcelona in 2009.
And she’d be one of very, very few Oscar winners who gets to thank a spouse who is also a nominee— that would be Being the Ricardos star and best actor nominee Javier Bardem.
For what it’s worth, our own David Canfield predicted Cruz to win when we did our Oscar predictions earlier this week, so if she does win, he gets credit for being first.

Not all of it will be aired live.
This year, the ceremony is scheduled to last four hours, but only three-quarters of it will be aired live.
Although the live telecast kicks off on ABC as usual at 8 p.m.
Everyone from Academy members to cineastes on social media has complained that cutting these more-technical categories from the live telecast suggests that they’re less important.
