     Sean Penn vows to ‘smelt’ Oscars if Zelensky isn’t invited on awards show
    </h2>

     Summary: “Now, it is my understanding that a decision has been made not to do it.
ICYMI: Actor Sean Penn says the Oscars should be boycotted if the ceremony’s planners have decided against having Zelensky on the program.
If we allow it to fight alone, our soul as America is lost,” he said in a statement to The Washington Post last month.
In a historic move this month, the International Chess Federation pulled tournaments from Russia and Belarus.
Days later, it banned one of the world’s top chess players for publicly voicing support for Putin.

     Sean Penn will “smelt” his Oscars in public if Ukrainian president not invited to awards
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sean Penn has threatened to “smelt” his Oscars in public if Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is not invited to tonight’s (March 27) 2022 Academy Awards.
Last week, Amy Schumer claimed that Oscars producers turned down her idea for the president to appear via video link at the ceremony.
I myself, if it comes back to it, when I return, I will smelt mine in public,” Penn said live on CNN.
Photos from the visit were released by the Ukrainian Joint Forces Operation Press Service at the time.
Other competitors for Best Picture include Licorice Pizza, CODA, Don’t Look Up, Drive My Car, King Richard and Nightmare Alley.

     Summary: The Watergate scandal is an iconic moment from the 1970s.
Still, Gaslit stars Julia Roberts and Sean Penn took an all-in approach.
It lays out the framework that Gaslit draws on, centering on Arkansan socialite Martha Mitchell and her husband, President Richard Nixon’s Attorney General John N. Mitchell.
After her hiring, Vanity Fair reports that she insisted on her personal friend Sean Penn playing John.

     Sean Penn: I’ll smelt my Oscars if Academy doesn’t let Zelenskiy speak
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sean Penn has described any potential lack of backing by the Academy Awards for the Ukrainian people as “the most obscene moment in all of Hollywood history”.
“There is nothing greater that the Academy Awards could do than to give [Zelenskiy] an opportunity to talk to all of us,” said Penn.
“But it’s not me producing the Oscars.” Other sources reported that Zelenskiy had declined an invitation to contribute via Zoom.
Penn urged a widespread boycott of the event should it be confirmed that an approach to Zelenskiy had not been made.
The 94th Academy Awards return to the Dolby theatre in Hollywood amid continued uncertainty over the attendance of nominees recently diagnosed with Covid.

Last week, Oscars host Amy Schumer claimed that her request to have the Ukrainian president address the star-studded gathering was rejected.
Appearing on CNN on Saturday (26 March), Penn said that the Academy had an obligation to allow Zelensky to speak amid the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.
“If it comes back to it, I will smelt mine in public,” Penn said.
Last month, Penn was seen at a press briefing at the Presidential Office in Kyiv, where he was filming a documentary.
