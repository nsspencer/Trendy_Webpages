     The Godfather: The Three Battles That Decided a Classic’s Fate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Godfather was also an exceptionally difficult film to make, despite the clear commercial success of Puzo’s 1969 novel, and battles were fought over nearly every aspect of its production.
The mob exerted actual pressure to stop the movie before filming even started.
“I don’t know if they could have stopped it, [but] I think they would’ve made it very difficult to film it in New York City,” Seals tells Den of Geek about the mafia’s campaign against the film.
I mean, they could have done it on a back lot or in another city, but I think that would’ve lost everything.
Francis Ford Coppola fought for those two things, doing it in a period of the 1940s and filming it in New York, which is what made it magical.”

What kind of economic function does the Mafia serve, and how does it get its start?
But if you dig into it, it does kind of make sense, right?
CA: To turn to the movie: One of the plot points of The Godfather is that Michael Corleone, the heir of the family business, is the only one of his siblings to attend college.
AT: So this is a fascinating question and a key plotline: Michael Corleone’s efforts to sort of escape his fate as the son of the Godfather.

     What ‘The Godfather’ at 50 Has to Teach Us About the Hollywood of Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The Godfather,” wrote the late Roger Ebert in 2010, “comes closest to being a film everyone agrees about.” Who can disagree?
By all known markers of Hollywood and, more impressively, world cinema success, Francis Ford Coppola’s beloved gangster chronicle is an enduring cultural object.
The “smaller” best picture winners of that decade, budget-wise, range from the little-movie-that-could vibes of Rocky to the humble two-hander Kramer vs. Kramer to, yes, the first Godfather movie.
The Coppola of the early Seventies didn’t expect The Godfather to be the hit that it was.
It’s a question of what we want the Hollywood of the future to be.
