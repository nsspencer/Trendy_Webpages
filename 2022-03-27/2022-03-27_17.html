     Summary: Ariana DeBose makes history with a best supporting actress winEnlarge this image toggle caption Neilson Barnard/Getty Images Neilson Barnard/Getty ImagesSixty years ago, Rita Moreno became the first Latina to win an Oscar, given for the role of Anita in West Side Story.
Today, Ariana DeBose won best supporting actress for the same role, becoming part of an elite club of Oscar-winners who've received the accolade for playing the same character.
DeBose, however, told NPR in a 2021 interview that she believes the film got it right.
"It is not every day that an Afro-Latina gets to be part of the main event," DeBose told NPR.
She was nominated for a Tony for Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role in a Musical for her role in Summer: The Donna Summer Musical.

     Summary: Actor Ariana DeBose has made history as the first Afro Latina and first openly queer woman of color to win an Academy Award for acting.
When you look into her eyes you see an openly queer woman of color, an Afro Latina, who found her strength in life through art.
Anita, Bernardo’s girlfriend and Maria’s friend, is Puerto Rican like the rest of the Sharks.
When Moreno won her acting Oscar for her portrayal of Anita 60 years ago, she made history as the first Latina to win the honor.

     Ariana DeBose Wins Best Supporting Actress for ‘West Side Story’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For her spirited portrayal of Anita in Steven Spielberg's "West Side Story," the Broadway star earns her first Oscar nomination and win.
From Broadway stages to turning her first Oscar nomination into a win, Ariana DeBose has made Oscars history.
DeBose won Best Supporting Actress during Sunday night’s Academy Awards ceremony, becoming the first openly queer person to ever win an Oscar in any acting category.
Even though [Rita Moreno’s] portrayal is so deep and grounding in that film, [in this film Anita] has more material, she gets to be seen in a different light.
You also watch a woman go through great grief.”As a longtime musical theater actress, DeBose never lost sight of what makes “West Side Story” tick: The music.

     Summary: A full-skirted ball gown or other expected red carpet look, however, was never a consideration for DeBose’s Oscar night experience, according to the styling duo, known as Zadrian + Sarah.
The look is finished with a dramatic coat that draped from DeBose’s elbows and matching shoes by Valentino Garavani.
Ariana DeBose Mike Coppola/Getty ImagesThe LGBTQ+ actress agrees wholeheartedly with her styling duo about the nontraditional strategy.
“The look that I’m wearing and the designer is a reflection of that; it shows me as myself in every way.
DeBose’s look is likewise a reflection of those values, stretching the boundaries of both gender and haute couture.
