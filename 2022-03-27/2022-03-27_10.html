     Billie Eilish and Finneas Were the Oscars’ Best-Dressed Siblings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Billie Eilish and Finneas are always a package deal.
As siblings and creative partners, they make music, perform, and occasionally dominate the red carpet together, too.
This was certainly the case at tonight’s Oscars, where the pair are set to perform during the ceremony.
Eilish and Finneas hit the step and repeat in complementary looks by Gucci.
Eilish wore designer Alessandro Michele’s tiered, ruffled, off-the-shoulder gown with a dramatic train.

     Billie Eilish Wins Best Original Song at Oscars 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In-person performances made their return to Oscars 2022 after most of the original-song nominees were performed at the preshow of last year’s Academy Awards.
The trophy for best original-song went to Billie Eilish and Finneas, for “No Time to Die” from No Time to Die, while Hans Zimmer won best original score for Dune.
Prior to their win, Eilish and Finneas performed their song against a macabre backdrop after an introduction from Bond villain Rami Malek.
No musical tribute to 2021’s films would be complete without Encanto, which won the Oscar for best animated film.
The show also spotlighted “We Don’t Talk About Bruno,” an earworm of a song that has topped Billboard charts and pop-cultural conversation, despite not getting submitted for best original song.

     Billie Eilish &amp; Finneas O’Connell Win Best Song Oscar For “No Time To Die” – Deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell won the Best Song Oscar for “No Time to Die,” the brother-sister duo’s power ballad from James Bond film No Time to Die.
Eilish thanked the Bond film team, while O’Connell paid tribute to the duo’s parents “who have always been our biggest inspirations and heroes.
Colombian singer-songwriter Sebastián Yatra performed “Dos Oruguitas,” Reba McEntire did the honors for “Somehow You Do” and Eilish and O’Connell performed the Bond theme they wrote.
Only Morrison wasn’t available to perform his nominated “Down to Joy,” due, he said, to a scheduling conflict with his ongoing tour.
The win marked yet another loss for the much-nominated Diane Warren, who has been Oscar-nominated 13 times without taking home a trophy.

     Watch Billie Eilish and Finneas Perform Searing ‘No Time To Die’ at Oscars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier on Oscars night, Billie Eilish revealed that writing a song for the James Bond franchise had been a longtime dream for her and her brother, Finneas, who used to practice writing “Bond songs” just to see what they could come up with.
They may be the youngest composers to write a Bond song, but this performance was proof they understood the assignment.
Really, just like picking their brains about it … It was really important to us that it felt like a Billie Eilish song and a James Bond song at the same time, and not one or the other,” Finneas said.
“I just really wanted [Daniel Craig] to love it.
He’s James Bond.”
