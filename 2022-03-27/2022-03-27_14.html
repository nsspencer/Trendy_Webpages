     Rachel Zegler Joked About Oscars 2022 Invite While Presenting With Jacob Elordi
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rachel Zegler addressed the elephant in the room — her belated invitation to the Academy Awards – while presenting the award for visual effects at Oscars 2022.
She took the stage with Euphoria star Jacob Elordi to present the award, playing off Jacob's opening sentence.
“I will root for ‘West Side Story’ from my couch and be proud of the work we so tirelessly did 3 years ago.
I hope some last-minute miracle occurs and I can celebrate our film in person but hey, that’s how it goes sometimes, I guess.
Meanwhile, Twitter couldn't help making a few jokes about the chaotic height difference between Jacob, who is 6'5", and Rachel, who is much shorter.

The back of the custom-made gown featured a braided strap down the middle, adding an edgy flair.
Co-star Ariana DeBose, who is nominated for Best Supporting Actress, also eschewed traditional Academy Award red carpet rules in a fiery red pantsuit from Valentino Haute Couture.

     After invite mess, ‘West Side Story’ star Rachel Zegler makes her Oscars debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “West Side Story” breakout Rachel Zegler looked oh so pretty on the Oscars red carpet after finally receiving a ticket to Hollywood’s biggest night.
The rising movie star — who was finally invited to attend the ceremony as a presenter after revealing she didn’t have a ticket to the show — made her Oscars debut Sunday in an elegant, black Dior gown.
In February, Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” received seven Oscar nominations — for director, cinematography, costume design, production design, sound, supporting actress and best picture.
Broadway star Ariana DeBose is favored to win the supporting actress prize for her acclaimed turn as Anita — the same role that landed Rita Moreno an Oscar in 1962.
In a full-circle moment, DeBose and Moreno also hit the Oscars red carpet together ahead of the show.

     Rachel Zegler Wears Sheer Black Dior Haute Couture to 2022 Oscars After Scoring Last-Minute Invite
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rachel Zegler is indeed at the 2022 Academy Awards — and in Dior, no less — a far cry from the sweatpants she expected to wear on Sunday night.
Zegler's appearance was a last-minute addition.
The actress revealed last week on social media that she had not received an invitation to the 2022 Oscar ceremony, despite West Side Story receiving seven nominations (and Zegler herself winning a Golden Globe Award for her performance as Maria).
After a fan wrote, "Can't wait to see what you'll be wearing on Oscar night," in the comments of an Instagram post, Zegler responded, "I'm not invited so sweatpants and my boyfriend's flannel."
She then elaborated in a follow-up comment that she was trying to attend the ceremony, but was unsuccessful in her efforts.

     Summary: Though Rachel Zegler was in attendance for the 2022 Oscars on Sunday night, she took a moment during the show to poke fun at not being invited to the ceremony in the first place.
“And I never thought that I would be here six days ago!
Zegler, who stars as Maria in best picture nominee West Side Story, revealed the surprise snub on Instagram.
How about the rare time that Latine people have a movie nominated for an OSCAR you invite the lead.

     Rachel Zegler Made It to the Oscars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One week after lamenting her lack of invitation, Rachel Zegler is at the Oscars.
Zegler joked about needing a gown to wear at the Oscars just five days ago, when she was officially announced as a presenter.
The actor also wore a Dior gown to the West Side Story premiere in December, making this Oscars red carpet a nice full-circle moment.
You’d think that making her feature debut in a movie nominated for Best Picture would have nabbed Zegler a seat at the Oscars, but alas!
But after revealing that she hadn’t been invited to the Oscars on Instagram, Zegler nabbed both a seat and a presenter gig at this year’s awards.
