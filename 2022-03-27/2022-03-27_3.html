He studied acting at Gallaudet University in Washington D.C., then toured with The National Theatre of the Deaf.

     Oscars History, ‘CODA’ Star Troy Kotsur Becomes First Deaf Male Actor to Win Academy Award
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Troy Kotsur is now the first deaf male actor to win an Academy Award, after taking home the Best Supporting Actor trophy for his performance in the film CODA.
"I just wanted to say that this is dedicated to the deaf community, the CODA community, and the disabled community," he said in his speech, which was translated as presenter Youn Yuh-jung held his statue.
"Sian Heder, you are the best communicator because you brought the deaf world and the hearing world together."
The first deaf actor to win an award was right beside him, too: Marlee Matlin, who scored the Oscar for Children of a Lesser God, played his wife in CODA.
Originally, the studio backing the film pushed for a famous hearing actor to take on the role of her husband. "

     Is "CODA" the "Green Book" of films about deaf people?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She decides her dream is music, something her deaf family — according to the film — could never understand.
But despite phenomenal performances by all the actors, "CODA" isn't the movie deaf and Hard of Hearing people have been waiting for.
The premise of "CODA" is troubling on paper: A deaf family whose hearing kid sings (cue the rimshot)!
But this movie is touted and celebrated as a "deaf" movie.
But "CODA" is not a movie by deaf people, and I would argue it's not for those of us who are deaf, either.

     It was a smash hit at Sundance. Will ‘CODA’ pull off a history-making upset at the Oscars?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When “CODA” had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival last year, it didn’t get thunderous applause or a standing ovation from the crowd.
And unlike the 2014 award-winning French film it is based on, “CODA” director Sian Heder actually cast deaf actors in her film.
“I hope that this opens the door to people getting that audiences want to see these kinds of stories,” Heder said while accepting the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival.
Beyond the awards, though, the film — which features a mostly deaf cast — is proving to be groundbreaking in terms of representation.
Not relegated to the background, like we’ve ticked this box.”But although the cast is mostly deaf, “CODA” isn’t just about deafness.
