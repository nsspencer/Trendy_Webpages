     Summary: North Carolina ended Saint Peter's Cinderella story as the No.
For the Tar Heels, it's an opportunity to once again spoil Mike Krzyzewski's final season with the Blue Devils.
This was a one-sided game from start to finish as North Carolina showed no mercy toward the sentimental favorite.
And unlike their overtime victory over Baylor, there was no steady collapse from the Tar Heels to gift Saint Peter's a second chance.
A few weeks ago, Saint Peter's was a nonentity to the vast majority of fans.

It will be the 258th meeting between the Blue Devils and Tar Heels, but the first time they have played in the NCAA Tournament.
Krzyzewski is 50-47 all-time against North Carolina, and his last game against the Tar Heels will be the most significant yet.
Smith finished with a 24-14 record against Krzyzewski, whose career has now touched the tenures of five North Carolina coaches.
Then, in an Elite Eight win over Saint Peter's, the Tar Heels simply dominated with size and athleticism.

So with Duke and Villanova moving on, we turn to Sunday’s games which will see Miami facing Kansas and UNC taking on Saint Peter’s.
And while UNC has most conventional advantages - bigger conference, far more resources, a bigger media footprint - Saint Peter’s has a few things going for it too.
This game is in Philly of course and the crowd is likely to be overwhelmingly behind Saint Peter’s.
Saint Peter’s doesn’t have to eliminate UNC’s three point shooting.

     Summary: Duke, North Carolina, Kansas, and Villanova are heading to New Orleans for the national semifinals, and it promises to be one of the most memorable Final Four fields ever.
The rivalry between Duke and North Carolina dates back more than 100 years, but they have never played in the NCAA tournament until now.
The fact that it’s happening in Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski’s final season feels too good to be true.
A loss to North Carolina in the Final Four to end Coach K’s career would be absolutely devastating.
McCormack will have to be at his best defensively against Villanova if Kansas wants to play for a national title.

     Summary: (0:51)The 2022 men's NCAA tournament has offered a variety of upsets that have made it one of college basketball's best postseason events in recent history.
In Mike Krzyzewski's final season, Duke and North Carolina will meet for the first time in NCAA tournament history, weeks after Hubert Davis' squad spoiled Coach K's final regular-season game at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
The two teams have never met in the NCAA tournament.
To have their first meeting in the Final Four in Mike Krzyzewski's final season is too perfect for a Hollywood script.
Last year, the Wildcats entered the NCAA tournament without Collin Gillespie, who had suffered a season-ending knee injury.
