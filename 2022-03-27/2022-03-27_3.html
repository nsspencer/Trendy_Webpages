     Raptors-Pacers Game Delayed by Fire; Fans Evacuated From Arena
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Toronto Raptors' victory over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night was delayed about 70 minutes in the second quarter and the arena evacuated because of a fire in a speaker hanging over the stands.
Players headed to their locker rooms with 4:05 left in the second quarter and the Raptors leading 66-38.
About a half-hour after the game was paused, a Raptors spokesperson said the team had consulted with Toronto Fire Services and hoped play could resume without fans in 30 or 40 minutes.
The Raptors played to no more than a few hundred fans at home games between Dec. 31 and Mar.
Eventually, Kuhn announced that the building was being evacuated at the order of Toronto Fire Services, telling booing fans that the game had been suspended.

     Summary: On Saturday, the Raptors game against the Indiana Pacers at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto was delayed for a significant amount of time due to a speaker catching on fire.
The evacuation was precautionary, as there was no immediate risk to fans in the arena, per Raptors public address announcer Herbie Kuhn.
Ultimately, the on-court action was resumed, but the fans weren't permitted to re-enter the arena.
We apologize to all of our fans who made it out to the game tonight and we thank our fans for their continued support.
The Raptors went on to win the game 131-91.

     Precious Achiuwa Explains How Toronto's Trust Has Helped Him Become a Reliable Three-Point Threat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was the mistake the Toronto Raptors have been trying to break him of this season.
When Fred VanVleet drove to the rim and kicked the ball out to the 6-foot-8 forward in the corner for a wide-open shot, Achiuwa needed to go up with it.
Indiana Pacers guard Terry Taylor closed out short on his shot defense, figuring that Achiuwa wouldn't take the three.
"Literally three guys on the bench are like you’ve got to shoot that, you have to," Achiuwa said.
All it is is just your teammates having that trust in you, honestly."
