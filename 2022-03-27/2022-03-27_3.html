     Summary: Until tonight, Kotsur’s “CODA” co-star, Marlee Matlin, was the only deaf person to win an acting Oscar.
It’s really amazing that our film “CODA” has reached out worldwide; it even reached all the way to the White House.
And the reason why is you brought the Deaf world and the hearing world together, and you are our bridge.
And your name will forever be on that bridge, Sian Heder Bridge, here in Hollywood.
I just wanted to say that this is dedicated to the Deaf community, the CODA community and the disabled community.

Ariana DeBose became the first Afro-Latina and openly LBGTQ actor to win an Academy Award for supporting actress.
Jane Campion won the Oscar best director for “The Power of the Dog,” her open-plains psychodrama that twisted and upended western conventions.
