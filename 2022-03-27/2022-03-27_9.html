     Summary: MIAMI (AP) — Kyrie Irving is finally going to play a home game for Brooklyn again on Sunday.
Brooklyn has been working under the assumption that Irving will be back next season and beyond.
After Saturday’s game at Miami, Irving and the Nets return home to host Charlotte on Sunday.
Irving has said he is unvaccinated, which has meant that he’s been eligible to only play road games for the Nets since re-joining the team in January.
Durant’s four-year, $194 million extension with the Nets starts next season, keeping him under contract to Brooklyn through the 2025-26 season.

Force Brooklyn to shoot ThreesIn their first matchup with the Nets this season, Charlotte held Brooklyn to just 25.7% shooting from three, Brooklyn’s ninth-worst three point shooting performance of the season.
If Charlotte can force Brooklyn to take contested three-pointers, a poor shooting night from Brooklyn and a Charlotte victory could be the result.

     Stephen A. Smith: Heat vulnerable to Nets or Raptors in first round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Prior to the Brooklyn Nets’ 110-95 win over the Miami Heat, there’s been much speculation about their chances of taking down the previously top-seeded team in the Eastern Conference in a first-round playoff series.
On ESPN’s First Take, Stephen A. Smith went as far to say that if either the Nets or Toronto Raptors were to face the Heat in the playoffs, Miami could end up having their playoff run ended early.
“If the seventh and eighth seed truly ends up being Brooklyn and Toronto, Miami will face one of them,” Smith said.
If the Heat fails to turn thing around in a hurry, Miami could end up sliding all the way down to fourth in the Eastern Conference standings.
If that was to occur, they could end up having to face the Chicago Bulls or Toronto Raptors in the first round of the playoffs.

     Kyrie Irving, Nets react to restored eligibility for home games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn Nets superstar Kyrie Irving recently became eligible once again to play in home games due to the addition of an athletes and entertainers exemption to the New York City vaccine mandate.
At the beginning of the season, the Nets had decided it was best to not have Irving even in the fold as a part-time player.
The Nets have been working through Irving’s part-time player status with the idea of looming adjustments to the New York City vaccine mandate would come prior to the start of the playoffs.
Irving is set to make his Nets home debut on Sunday when the team takes on the Charlotte Hornets.
When the news of changes to the New York City vaccine mandate was released, he was “pinching” himself due to the up and down nature of the way the situation has played out.
