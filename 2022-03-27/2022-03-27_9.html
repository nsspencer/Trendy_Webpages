He was nominated twice before for best actor (for "Ali" and "The Pursuit of Happyness").Smith's performance as Richard Williams, father to Venus and Serena, has remained the most likely choice throughout the season.
It always sounds like actors trying to be humble saying, 'Well, you know, I don't think about awards in that way.
"His focus is instead on the power of "King Richard's" ensemble and story of the Williams family.
"I'm finding myself with the attention being on the hearts and the experience the people around me rather than where or not my name gets called," Smith said.

"Couldn't wipe this Black off if I tried (Black off if I tried)," Beyoncé sings in the chorus.

     King Richard: Why Will Smith’s Venus and Serena drama deserves to win the Oscar for Best Picture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: King Richard has always existed in abstract.
But it’s less likely that you’ve actually seen King Richard.
Such dismissal couldn’t have happened to a less deserving film: King Richard is far more complex than it first lets on, and is also buoyed by charm and affability.
Despite its optics as a treacly biopic endorsed by the famous women it revolves around, King Richard spends a lot of time in those uncertain waters.
But there is a lovely gentleness to King Richard all the same, from its visual warmth – Los Angeles has never looked sunnier – to the Nineties jams on its soundtrack.

     ‘King Richard’: An embodiment of the American dream
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A sports biopic about a father’s desire to make his two daughters tennis stars, “King Richard—”, directed by Reinaldo Marcus Greene, details Serena and Venus Williams’ journey to become two of the greatest tennis players in history.
Prior to the birth of his daughters, Richard Williams (Will Smith) formulates a plan to raise the two to stardom and make history.
Loud, brash, and opinionated, Richard is the driving force behind his daughters’ strict practice regiments and tireless search for coaches.
Throughout the movie, Richard’s stubborn nature often clashes with the opinions of coaches.
Being a tribute to Richard, the film never outwardly criticizes him for his seemingly rash decisions, but still effectively conveys his flaws.

     Watch Beyoncé Perform “Be Alive” From “King Richard” at Oscars 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In one of the best moments of Oscars 2022 already, Beyoncé kicked off the ceremony with a performance of her beautiful original song from Will Smith-led King Richard, “Be Alive," which she also co-wrote.
It was already a landmark year for Beyoncé, who earned her first-ever Oscar nomination for “Be Alive” in the Best Original Song category (though let's be honest, she deserved it for Dreamgirls, Lion King, etc etc).
Bey's performance was held on a tennis court in Compton — in an homage to Venus and Serena Williams's upbringing — with dozens of musicians clad in gorgeous tennis ball yellow-green.
Beyoncé was celebratory and glowing, bringing to life the some of the song's most powerful lines: “The path was never paved with gold, we fought and built this on our own."
The dancers also wore beads in their hair, a reference to Venus and Serena's hairstyles on the court early in their tennis career.
