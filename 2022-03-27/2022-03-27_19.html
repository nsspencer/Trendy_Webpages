     Kirsten Dunst's Oscars 2022 Dress Was Vintage Lacroix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kirsten Dunst is nominated for her first-ever Oscar, and she showed up to Sunday night’s Academy Awards in Los Angeles looking fully ready to step onto the stage.
Dunst has been known to favor vintage when it comes to some of the biggest red carpet moments of the year.
(And a practically unparalleled one apart from Zendaya, who recently attended the 53rd annual NAACP Images Awards in a Balenciaga couture gown circa 1956.)
Photo by Kevin Mazur/WireImage via Getty ImagesThis isn’t the first time that Dunst has worn vintage Lacroix, whose red carpet moments have unfortunately have been few and far between since he retired (barring an unforgettable collaboration with Dries Van Noten in 2019).
She also threw it back to Lacroix’s archives in 2017, resurrecting the very same gown she wore to Vanity Fair’s 2004 Oscars after-party 13 years prior.
