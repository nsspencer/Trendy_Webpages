     Kenneth Branagh wins first Oscar as Belfast takes best original screenplay
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kenneth Branagh has won his first Oscar following eight nominations at the 94th Academy Awards in Hollywood.
Branagh took the award for best original screenplay for Belfast, his autobiographical coming-of-age film set at the advent of the Troubles.
He then paid tribute to those “lost along the way”, including John Sessions and Jim Dornan, the father of Belfast’s star, Jamie Dornan.
“We miss them, we love them, we will never forget them,” Branagh continued.
Both he and Belfast star Ciaran Hinds appear to have recovered in time for the Oscars.

     How Oscar nominee ‘Belfast’ explores Kenneth Branagh’s childhood
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Described in Times critic Justin Chang’s review as “Kenneth Branagh’s wobbly crowd-pleaser about his tumultuous early years in Northern Ireland,” “Belfast” earned seven Oscar nominations including best picture, directing, original song, original screenplay, sound and nods in the supporting actor categories for Ciarán Hinds and Judi Dench.
All of this despite its title.
Still, “Outlander” star Caitríona Balfe somehow missed out on a nomination for her standout performance, while “Fifty Shades of Grey” actor Jamie Dornan had also earned attention for his work (and the way he belts out “Everlasting Love”).
The movie has had a bit of a bumpy journey to Oscars, winning the audience award at the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival after it had world-premiered at the Telluride Film Festival, but then finding a modest reception at the domestic box office and failing to pick up any major best picture precursor prizes.
Nevertheless, it does bring a welcome new perspective on the Troubles to the screen.

     Sir Kenneth Branagh found it hard to get financing for Belfast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sir Kenneth Branagh struggled to get financing for 'Belfast'.
“I’ve gone from people saying, ‘Hey, it’s a lovely script but nobody’s going to see this, Ken,’ to Steven saying that.
"The political process has lurched from crisis to crisis and there is understandable psychic baggage that children of the Troubles carry.
Catriona Balfe, who stars in the movie, said: “Ken said it took so long to write because his parents never talked about the Troubles.
People repressed the trauma.”And Kenneth was worried about how it would be perceived in Belfast because it is a place where "having ideas above your station is a cardinal sin”.

     Kenneth Branagh Honors Those Facing “Violence and Loss” While Accepting First-Ever Oscar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kenneth Branagh is finally an Academy Award winner, taking home the best original screenplay prize for Belfast at the 2022 Oscars on Sunday.
Branagh had received eight nominations in his career heading into the ceremony, and his semiautobiographical film, which he also directed, earned seven nominations.
His first career nominations came for best actor and best director for 1989’s Henry V.“This story is the search for joy and hope in the face of violence and loss,” Branagh said about Belfast from the stage.
“We lost some people along the way: Johnny Sessions, [star Jamie Dornan’s father] Jim Dornan, Leah Newman.
However, the category was seen as a tough one to predict, as Don’t Look Up‘s script was the top choice at the Writers Guild Awards, while Licorice Pizza‘s screenplay won the BAFTA Award.
