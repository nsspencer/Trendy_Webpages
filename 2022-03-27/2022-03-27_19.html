     Ariana DeBose makes LGBTQ+ history with 'West Side Story'

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EMBED &gt;More News Videos There's no Oscar for casting, but Cindy Tolan's work on "West Side Story" proves there's no doubt the job is critical to the success of a movie.
LOS ANGELES -- Sixty years after "West Side Story" won top honors at the 1962 Oscars, the 2021 adaptation made history of its own Sunday night as Ariana DeBose became the first Afro-Latina and openly LGBTQ+ actor to win best supporting actress.
For the 2021 film, starring newcomer Rachel Zegler and Ansel Elgort as Maria and Tony, Spielberg and writer Tony Kushner focused on creating an authentic portrayal of New York's San Juan Hill neighborhood in the 1950s.
Spielberg says they brought in historical consultants who lived in the neighborhood at the time to guide the cast.
"The whole template of our reimagined 'West Side Story' based on the Broadway play was it needed to be authentic.
