     Will Smith Slaps Chris Rock at Oscars 2022 After Joke Gone Wrong
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At Sunday night’s Oscar ceremony, Will Smith shocked the room by approaching the stage and slapping presenter Chris Rock in the face after the comedian made a joke about Smith’s wife, actor Jada Pinkett Smith.
(Pinkett Smith has spoken in the past about her battle with alopecia.)
Shortly after Rock made the joke, Smith walked to the stage and slapped the comedian across the face.
But the show’s audio immediately cut out after Smith slapped Rock, then stayed muted as Rock said, “Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me,” while Smith walked away.
When Smith yelled from his seat, Rock, still onstage, seemed stunned.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “CODA” delivered two upsets by winning best picture at the 94th Academy Awards.
Apple’s victory marks the first time a streamer has won the best picture award.
“CODA” won in all three categories it competed in, including supporting actor (Troy Kotsur), and adapted screenplay (Siân Heder).
Accepting the best picture award, producer Philippe Rousselet praised the chemistry among “CODA” cast members, a contributing factor to the film’s surge among Oscar voters.
It’s been five years since a streaming film—Amazon’s “Manchester By the Sea”—first broke into the best picture race.
