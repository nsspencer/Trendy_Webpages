     CONCACAF live: USMNT vs. Panama, Mexico vs. Honduras, Canada qualifies for 2022 World Cup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With a 4-0 win at home over Jamaica, Canada has sealed qualification to its second FIFA men's World Cup ever, and first since 1986.
It's a big day for the USMNT as well, as Gregg Berhalter's side could also take a huge step towards qualifying after tonight's games.
A United States win at home over Panama would likely wrap up at least a spot in the intercontinental playoff, and perhaps direct qualification depending on other results.
Mexico can achieve a similar result with a win at Honduras, which has already been eliminated from contention for a World Cup spot.
The Athletic's Sam Stejskal and Paul Tenorio are on the ground in Orlando with the USMNT, Josh Kloke is with Canada in Toronto, while Felipe Cárdenas will have his eye on Mexico.

     USMNT eyes World Cup berth with win vs. Panama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares 0 EmailORLANDO, Florida — After 12 World Cup qualifiers, and the ups and downs of navigating the Octagonal with a young squad, the U.S. men’s national team stands on the verge of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup with a win on Sunday against Panama.
If the Americans defeat Panama, and Costa Rica ties or loses in El Salvador, then the USMNT will secure its return to the World Cup after missing the 2014 tournament.
Now, if the USMNT loses to Panama, then the Americans would head into their Octagonal finale against Costa Rica needing a win to ensure an automatic World Cup berth, which would require winning in Costa Rica, something the USMNT has never done in World Cup qualifying.
A draw on Sunday would allow the Americans to secure an automatic World Cup berth with a win or draw in Costa Rica, regardless of what the Ticos do in El Salvador on Sunday.
“Panama’s a good team, well coached team, physical team, and they’re going to put up big resistance,” Berhalter said on Saturday.

     Summary: It is the final stretch of CONCACAF Qualification for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
Mexico is expected to confirm their place against lowly Honduras, while the USMNT has a pivotal game versus Panama to come back to the World Cup.
With so much riding on this game, we look at three reasons why the USMNT will take down Panama and secure World Cup qualification.
Regardless of that, their World Cup qualification should be secured, if through nothing then through the sheer individual quality that coach Gregg Berhalter has in his ranks.
They need to avoid embarrassmentSpeaking about that 2018 World Cup omission for the USMNT, it was beyond embarrassing.

     USMNT-Panama: How Gregg Berhalter's strategy of heavy rotation could pay off as World Cup qualification looms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During World Cup qualifying it's rare that a team has their entire squad available all the time.
Rotation is something that the team is prepared for as 38 players have featured so far during World Cup qualifying with 21 of them playing 90 or more minutes.
Ahead of the USMNT's critical home qualifier against Panama on Sunday in Orlando, Berhalter finds himself in need of a roster change.
He depends on rotation, but he also needs to know what he's getting from the players he's bringing in.
Had they won that match, simply a draw against Panama on Sunday would have been enough to clinch a World Cup spot.

     USA 5, Panama 0: Pulisic nets first USMNT hat trick (VIDEO)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And based on the first half of its match vs. Panama, it’s going to be the former.
The U.S. hosted Panama in Orlando in the second-to-last match in qualifying in the last cycle, too, and it went rather well.
On the other end, Pulisic had the first dangerous moment for the Americans, having his half-chance just inside the Panama box blocked.
Reyna played Pulisic down the left-hand side, and his shot attempt wound up being a cross to Ferreira at the far post.
Pulisic, after scoring on two PKs, took on Panama’s defense for a sensational third, completing his first career USMNT hat trick in spectacular fashion to extend the lead.
