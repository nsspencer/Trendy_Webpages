     'CODA' Wins Best Picture. What It Means for the Growth of Apple TV+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “CODA” took home the best picture prize at the Oscars on Sunday night, and one analyst thinks the win for Apple TV+ could lead to a major boost in subscribers to the streaming service.
The win for “CODA,” released on Apple TV+, is the first time a streaming service won the top prize at the Academy Awards.
It bested Netflix’s ‘Power of the Dog,'” which also was seen as a strong contender.

     Summary: 'CODA' brings home the Oscar for best picture, a historic win for the Deaf communityEnlarge this image toggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty ImagesCODA has been named best picture, beating out the likes of Belfast, Drive My Car and Power of the Dog at the 2022 Academy Awards.
It's a historic win for a film that brings Deaf culture, and Deaf actors, to the forefront.
Written and directed by Sian Heder, CODA is based on the 2014 French film La Famille Bélier.
Distributed by Apple TV+, it is also the first best picture win for a streaming service.
Eight of the ten Best Picture nominees were available on streaming services in the weeks leading up to the award ceremony.

     CODA is the first streaming movie to win Best Picture at the Oscars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a bizarre, eventful, and bizarrely eventful Oscars telecast, the biggest award of the night—Best Picture—was given to one of the favorites from the whole show: director Siân Heder’s Apple TV+ film CODA.
In addition to Best Picture, it won Best Adapted Screenplay and awards season star Troy Kotsur won Best Supporting Actor, giving it a perfect record in terms of the categories it was nominated in.
Better yet, two of those wins are historically significant, with Kotsur becoming the first deaf man to win an acting Oscar and CODA itself being the first streaming film to win Best Picture at the Oscars—after years of Netflix and Amazon making big plays for the highest honor in Hollywood.
The fact that it landed on Apple TV+, a streaming service, seems incidental.
(That being said, Netflix boss Ted Sarandos must be fuming about this on the inside, right?)

     Apple’s CODA tops Netflix to win 2022 Best Picture Oscar
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After Netflix’s The Power of the Dog paraded through awards season with frontrunner status, this year’s coveted Best Picture award went to CODA, the Apple TV Plus family drama.
Based on the 2014 French film La Famille Bélier, CODA was the Little Film That Could of the 2022 Oscar gauntlet.
The past several years have seen Netflix spending gobs of money in an attempt to win Oscar clout.
And to some degree, it’s worked: the streaming service’s movies have been nominated for Best Picture each year since 2019, and have won in categories like Best Supporting Actress, Best Foreign Language Film, Best Documentary, and many of the shorts categories.
Apple TV Plus is the first streaming service to snag a Best Picture winner — but it certainly won’t be the last.

“CODA” writer-director Siân Heder was also recently recognized with this year’s WGA Award and BAFTA Film Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

     With ‘CODA’ best picture win, Apple beats Netflix to Oscar glory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Advertisement“CODA” was Apple’s first nominee for best picture, whereas Netflix has had a string of nominees in its pursuit of the academy’s most desired honor.
Industry estimates peg Apple’s promotional campaign for “CODA” at more than $10 million, which is typical for a serious best picture contender.
The Los Gatos company came close in 2019 with Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma,” which won three statuettes, but not best picture.
Three of the best picture nominees — “The Power of the Dog,” “CODA” and “Don’t Look Up” — were released by streaming companies.
Focus Features’ “Belfast,” set in the turmoil of 1960s Northern Ireland, won original screenplay for Kenneth Branagh.

     How CODA managed to pull out a Best Picture win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Until a couple weeks ago, nobody really seemed to think Sian Heder’s film CODA, the little family drama that could, would pull out any Oscar wins, let alone Best Picture.
No Sundance premiere has ever won Best Picture.
But here we are: A movie distributed by a streaming service has won Best Picture, for the first time in 94 years of Oscar history.
On the other hand, it’s hard to see exactly how it fits the Best Picture category.
It may not really be 2021’s best film, but CODA’s Best Picture win might just make the best sense.

     Summary: It’s the first film with a largely deaf cast to win best picture.
Not since 1932’s “Grand Hotel” has a movie won best picture with fewer than four nods.
Smith, who plays Venus and Serena Williams’ father in “King Richard,” later in the show won best actor, his first Oscar.
Jane Campion won the Oscar best director for “The Power of the Dog,” her open-plains psychodrama that twisted and upended western conventions.
Campion, who had been the first woman ever twice nominated in the category (previously for 1993’s “The Piano”), is only the third woman to win best director.

     Oscars 2022: How ‘CODA’ won best picture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not Apple TV+, which became the first streaming service to win the best picture Oscar.
Matlin’s unshakable faith notwithstanding, “CODA” stands as one of the most unlikely best picture winners in the history of the Oscars.
“CODA” earned three in all, including for Heder and Kotsur, a low total for a best picture contender.
(1932’s “Grand Hotel” was the last movie to win best picture without at least one of these noms.)
By the end of February, those omissions seemed to matter a bit less when “CODA” won the film ensemble honor at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.
