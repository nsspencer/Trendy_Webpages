     Summary: A fire at a speaker at the Scotiabank Arena caused the match between the Toronto Raptors and Indiana Pacers to be halted and the venue was evacuated.
The Pacers Raptors game in Toronto was suspended and the arena cleared due to smoke.
pic.twitter.com/sci7Nyi3LB – ESPN (espn) March 27, 2022The incident began in the second quarter when the score was 66-38 in favor of the Canadians.
Raptors public speaking announcer Herbie Kuhn has been heard testing the system several times, but the keynote speakers above the stands didn’t seem to work.
The game later resumed without an audience in the stands and the Raptors reported that tickets would be refunded.

     For the Raptors, arena evacuation and Pacers no cause for alarm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s the truth of it, as a weird Saturday night at Scotiabank Arena proved.
The orderly evacuation of the arena came with 4:05 left in the second quarter, after two sections were originally emptied when flames were spotted coming from a speaker.
Blistering the Pacers with 68 per cent shooting and a 41-point first quarter, the Raptors got a weakened opponent down and didn’t let up.
“The point is, I feel like we can play against anybody any night, but we also have to understand that we need to play against everybody every night,” Nurse said.
Pascal Siakam had 23 points to lead the Raptors, while Scottie Barnes had 19 and Anunoby 16 in his 28 minutes.

     Raptors crush Pacers in front of no fans and after 70-minute fire delay
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TORONTO — Precious Achiuwa spent much of the 70-minute fire delay changing into a fresh jersey, and going through his pre-game stretching routine — again.
On one of the oddest nights in Raptors history, Toronto crushed the Indiana Pacers 131-91 after a speaker fire at Scotiabank Arena suspended play for more than an hour and saw fans evacuated for the remainder of the game.
Pascal Siakam led the way with 23 points for Toronto (42-32), who moved past Cleveland into sixth place in the Eastern Conference.
Former Raptor and Toronto native Oshae Brissett topped the Pacers (25-50) with 21 points, while Justin Anderson finished with 18.
The Raptors play all but two — Orlando and New York — of their final games at home.

     Summary: The Raptors are one game behind the fifth-place Bulls with eight games remaining.
Pacers acting head coach Lloyd Pierce said he spoke to lead official Zach Zarba about the acrid smell coming from the burning speaker.
“Fifteen years for me, probably the most bizarre situation that we’ve been in for a game,” Pierce added.
CHECKING ON COACHPacers coach Rick Carlisle missed his second straight game for personal reasons.
Raptors: G Gary Trent Jr. (left big toe) sat for the third straight game but is “pretty close” to a return, Nurse said.
