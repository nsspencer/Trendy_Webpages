     Actor Sean Penn says he'll destroy his own Oscar if Ukraine's Zelenskyy isn't allowed to speak during broadcast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actor Sean Penn says he will destroy his Academy Award if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy isn't allowed to speak during the broadcast.
In an interview with CNN, Penn, 61, said having Zelenskyy speak during Sunday's broadcast was of the utmost importance.
He said if Zelenskyy isn't given the floor for an address during the broadcast, Penn will destroy his own Oscar.
During the interview, Penn reminded viewers that Zelenskyy is also a fellow thespian with a long career in the arts.
Earlier this month, Netflix announced that the popular political satire TV series, “Servant of the People,” in which Zelenskyy stars, would returned to the streaming platform.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sean Penn has said he will melt down his Oscars if Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is denied the opportunity to speak during Sunday’s Academy Awards.
The Oscar-winning actor and filmmaker has also encouraged the acting community to boycott Hollywood’s biggest night if organisers object to allowing Mr Zelensky to feature in the biggest night in Hollywood’s calendar.
Penn, who is also the co-founder of the Core Response aid charity, has met with Mr Zelensky on several occasions and described the Ukrainian leader as “an incredibly moving human being”.
That is not me commenting on whether or not President Zelensky had wanted to.
Discussing her pitch for Mr Zelensky to make an appearance during the show, Mrs Schumer said: “I am not afraid to go there, but it’s not me producing the Oscars.”

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sean Penn has described any potential lack of backing by the Academy Awards for the Ukrainian people as “the most obscene moment in all of Hollywood history”.
“There is nothing greater that the Academy Awards could do than to give [Zelenskiy] an opportunity to talk to all of us,” Penn said.
“But it’s not me producing the Oscars.” Other sources reported that Zelenskiy had declined an invitation to contribute via Zoom.
Penn urged a widespread boycott of the event should it be confirmed that no approach to Zelenskiy had been made.
The 94th Academy Awards return to the Dolby theatre in Hollywood amid continued uncertainty over the attendance of nominees recently diagnosed with Covid.
