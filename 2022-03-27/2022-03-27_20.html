     Summary: Scheffler’s Scotty Cameron by Titleist putter, which is longer than standard at 36 inches in length, also is relatively new, having gone in the bag before his win at the WM Phoenix Open.
“It’s a similar style to what I used before, but the top line is a little thinner and it feels like it sits a little lower,” he said.
I’ve always used something in that same general style.
They gave me this one in Phoenix because they were tired of putting lead tape on my other one all the time to make it heavier.
This one has the adjustable weights on the sole which makes getting the weight right easier.”

     Scottie Scheffler to become 25th No. 1-ranked golfer in modern era after 2022 WGC-Dell Match Play win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With his 4 and 3 victory over Kevin Kisner in the championship match of the 2022 WGC-Dell Match Play, Scottie Scheffler did something that multi-time major winners Phil Mickelson, Collin Morikawa, Jose Maria Olazabal and Bubba Watson have never accomplished.
1-ranked golfer in the Official World Golf Rankings when the new list is released Monday.
Two months ago, Scheffler had never won a PGA Tour event; he was 0 for 70.
Scheffler took home the Phoenix Open and Arnold Palmer Invitational leading into this week's match play, going from "best to never have won on Tour" to world No.
"I'll believe it when I see it on the world rankings tomorrow," Scheffler told NBC after his championship match.

     Summary: AUSTIN, Texas – If Sunday’s semifinal slate at Austin Country Club didn’t entertain you, then maybe match play isn’t your thing.
The morning matches at the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play had everything the format offers: from dramatic lead changes to stifling performances that set the stage for the afternoon final between Scottie Scheffler and Kevin Kisner.
Matches and scoring from the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play Championship“It felt like a heavyweight bout.
He's a hell of a ball striker, always in play, hitting great shots after great shots,” Kisner said of Conners.
If Scheffler can win the finals match against Kisner, he will become the No.

     Summary: Fields noticed that when he did so, Scheffler would often struggle, forcing something that simply didn’t come naturally.
But when Fields stayed quiet and let Scheffler visualize and execute his own shot, that’s when the magic would happen.
1 golfer in the world by virtue of his victory at the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play.
I wanted to hit a really cool shot and kind of, that was maybe showing off a little bit.
I just hit a poor shot, and it was really one of the few poor shots I hit today.

     Hook em! Scottie Scheffler wins Match Play and goes to No. 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sunday in the Dell Technologies Match Play was special for so many reasons, and the new No.
From a top junior in Dallas to four years as a Texas Longhorn to his time outside the ropes at the Match Play watching the world’s best, all Scheffler wanted to do was play alongside them.
One year after losing in the championship match, Scheffler never trailed against Kevin Kisner, building a 3-up lead through six holes and giving him no chance to catch up.
Kisner won the Match Play three years ago.
Scheffler joined Kisner as the only players to win the Match Play the year after losing in the championship match.
