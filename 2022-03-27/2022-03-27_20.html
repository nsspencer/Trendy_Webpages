     How Oscar nominee ‘Belfast’ explores Kenneth Branagh’s childhood
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Described in Times critic Justin Chang’s review as “Kenneth Branagh’s wobbly crowd-pleaser about his tumultuous early years in Northern Ireland,” “Belfast” earned seven Oscar nominations including best picture, directing, original song, original screenplay, sound and nods in the supporting actor categories for Ciarán Hinds and Judi Dench.
All of this despite its title.
Still, “Outlander” star Caitríona Balfe somehow missed out on a nomination for her standout performance, while “Fifty Shades of Grey” actor Jamie Dornan had also earned attention for his work (and the way he belts out “Everlasting Love”).
The movie has had a bit of a bumpy journey to Oscars, winning the audience award at the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival after it had world-premiered at the Telluride Film Festival, but then finding a modest reception at the domestic box office and failing to pick up any major best picture precursor prizes.
Nevertheless, it does bring a welcome new perspective on the Troubles to the screen.

     Belfast rallies around workers displaced by fire that destroyed Penobscot McCrum potato plant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Environmental and fire crews continued to assess the Penobscot McCrum factory site this weekend after a massive fire took down the potato processing plant on Thursday.
The Department of Environmental Protection has been monitoring the ammonia tanks at the property to ensure their stability.
The US Environmental Protection Agency was checking the perimeter of the fire zone for ammonia and other hazardous materials.
Herbig says the McCrum family is meeting with the city on Tuesday to discuss clean-up and rebuilding on the site.
"Penobscot McCrum has been a mainstay in this community for a long time, and has a lot of history here," she said.

     Maine potato growers expecting hit after Belfast fire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BELFAST, Maine (WMTW) - The large fire at a potato processing plant in Belfast is expected to have ripple effects across Maine’s agriculture industry.
The Penobscot McCrum plant processed Maine-grown spuds into products sold around the country.
Don Flannery, executive director of the Maine Potato Board, said the loss of the plant will have a negative impact on the state’s potato growers.
“I think everyone wants to do everything they can to get that plant back because it’s important in our industry.
Flannery said the McCrum family has been a leader in Maine’s potato industry for decades, offering growing opportunities to turn their crops into specialized products at the Belfast plant.
