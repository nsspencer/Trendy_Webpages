Amy went over to Kristen, jokingly pretending that she was a seat filler, and took over her seat before chatting with Jesse.
Jesse responded to Amy taking over Kirsten‘s seat by saying, “You just took my wife’s seat.”Amy then asked, “Oh you’re married to a seat filler?” to which Jesse responded, “Yes.”If you didn’t know, Kirsten and Jesse have been together since 2016 and got engaged in 2017.
In an interview back in February, Kirsten said that she and Jesse refer to each other as “husband and wife,” even though they haven’t officially gotten married yet.
I didn’t want to be pregnant, get married, have a party and not be able to have fun with everybody.”
