     Summary: (CNN) Ariana DeBose won best actress in a supporting role for "West Side Story" at the Academy Awards on Sunday and made history as the first openly queer woman of color to win in the category.

When DeBose took the stage she emotionally said, "Even in this weird world we live in, dreams do come true."
DeBose spoke movingly about her experience as a queer Afro-Latina woman.
"For anyone who has ever questioned their identity, there is indeed a place for us," she said, quoting her film.

     Summary: Ariana DeBose won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Anita in Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of “West Side Story.” It is her first Academy Award.
DeBose is also the first openly queer star to win an acting Oscar.
In accepting the award, DeBose made reference to being a queer woman of color and said:Imagine this little girl in the back seat of a white Ford Focus.
You see a queer — openly queer — woman of color, an Afro-Latina, who found her strength in life through art, and that’s what I believe we are here to celebrate.
The actress-singer-dancer has also been nominated for a Tony for her role as Donna Summer in the short-lived musical “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical.”DeBose will next be seen in Matthew Vaughn’s spy movie, “Argylle,” for Apple TV+.

     Ariana DeBose wins best supporting actress Oscar for ‘West Side Story’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Ben KellermanLOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Ariana DeBose won her first Academy Award on Sunday for her supporting role as Anita in Steven Spielberg’s remake of classic musical “West Side Story.”A relative newcomer to feature films, 31-year-old DeBose earned mainstream acclaim for her lively portrayal of Anita, an outspoken Puerto Rican woman who showcases her singing and dancing talents in the song “America.”She also won a Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild award and British Academy Film Award for her performance.
“It was the summer of a lifetime and I am most privileged and grateful to spend it with all of you,” DeBose said in accepting her award.
“I am America,” she told OUT Magazine in November 2021.
“I am damn near a member of just about every marginalized community.”This is the second time the role of Anita has earned the best supporting actress award: Rita Moreno in 1962 became the first Latina actress to win an Oscar for her performance in the original “West Side Story.” Moreno, 90, joined Spielberg’s remake as drugstore owner Valentina, a new character written just for her.
DeBose’s fellow supporting actress nominees were Kirsten Dunst for “Power of the Dog,” Aunjanue Ellis for “King Richard,” Judi Dench for “Belfast” and Jessie Buckley for “The Lost Daughter.”(Reporting by Ben Kellerman and Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Howard Goller)

Today, Ariana DeBose won best supporting actress for the same role, becoming part of an elite club of Oscar-winners who've received the accolade for playing the same character.
DeBose, however, told NPR in a 2021 interview that she believes the film got it right.
"It is not every day that an Afro-Latina gets to be part of the main event," DeBose told NPR.
She was nominated for a Tony for Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role in a Musical for her role in Summer: The Donna Summer Musical.

     Summary: And we’re off: Not just the first (broadcast) Oscar of the night, but also the first major milestone, as Best Supporting Actress winner Ariana DeBose became the first openly queer woman to win an acting Oscar.
AdvertisementDeBose won, of course, for her performance in Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story, where she took on the role of Anita.
DeBose won out in a packed Best Supporting Actress crowd, coming out ahead of performances from Kirsten Dunst, Judi Dench, Jessie Buckley, and Aunjanue Ellis.
Tonight’s ceremony is actually only the first time in 20 years that an openly queer performer has even been nominated for an acting award (Kristen Stewart, who’s up for Best Actress for Spencer, is in a similar boat to DeBose).
(She’s also only the second actor born in the 1990s to win, after Jennifer Lawrence, but that’s more just weird, and not “deeply infuriating.”)

     Summary: For her spirited portrayal of Anita in Steven Spielberg's "West Side Story," the Broadway star earns her first Oscar nomination and win.
From Broadway stages to turning her first Oscar nomination into a win, Ariana DeBose has made Oscars history.
DeBose won Best Supporting Actress during Sunday night’s Academy Awards ceremony, becoming the first openly queer person to ever win an Oscar in any acting category.
Even though [Rita Moreno’s] portrayal is so deep and grounding in that film, [in this film Anita] has more material, she gets to be seen in a different light.
You also watch a woman go through great grief.”As a longtime musical theater actress, DeBose never lost sight of what makes “West Side Story” tick: The music.

     Summary: In her Oscar acceptance speech, DeBose said she found her “strength in life through art.”LOS ANGELES — Ariana DeBose lived up to Oscar predictions and her “West Side Story” predecessor Rita Moreno.
DeBose won the best supporting actress trophy Sunday for her breakout performance as the fierce Anita, 60 years after Moreno claimed the award in 1962 for the original film version of the Broadway musical.
Moreno was an Oscar pioneer, the first Latina to win an acting award.
DeBose is a groundbreaker in her own right, the first Afro-Latina and openly LGBTQ actor to win in the category.
“She just said, ‘Enjoy it, honey!’” DeBose told AP.
