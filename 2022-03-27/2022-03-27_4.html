     Summary: This weekend, consider Los Angeles the fashion capital of the world.
In addition to the forthcoming red carpet looks at tonight’s Oscar ceremony, there has been a slew of stylish fetes hosted by all of the biggest fashion houses.
And yesterday night, so too did Gucci at Gucci Osteria da Massimo Bottura in Beverly Hills for a meal to honor Jessica Chastain for her Oscar nomination as Best Actress in The Eyes of Tammy Faye.
Chastain wore a black velvet Peter Pan-collared Gucci dress (perhaps a preview of what she’ll wear tonight?)
and the Italian label also dressed Hathaway and Saldana to perfection.

     Jessica Chastain Wins Best Actress at Oscars 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At Sunday night’s Oscars 2022 ceremony, Chastain picked up the best-actress statuette for her performance in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, in which she portrayed the titular televangelist, Tammy Faye Bakker.
In her speech, she thanked director Michael Showalter, costar Andrew Garfield, and the movie’s hair and makeup team, who won an Oscar themselves for transforming Chastain into Bakker.
Chastain won out in a stacked category that included Kristen Stewart (Spencer), Nicole Kidman (Being the Ricardos), Olivia Colman (The Lost Daughter), and Penélope Cruz (Parallel Mothers).
The Eyes of Tammy Faye earned two Oscar nods overall: Chastain for best actress, and Stephanie Ingram, Linda Dowds, and Justin Raleigh, who won for best makeup and hairstyling.
Her second nomination came the following year, for best actress in the terrorist drama Zero Dark Thirty.

     Jessica Chastain wins best actress Oscar for ‘ The Eyes of Tammy Faye’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Steve GormanLOS ANGELES, March 27 (Reuters) – Jessica Chastain won the Academy Award on Sunday for best lead actress for her mascara-laden title role as the on-air preaching partner and wife of Christian televangelist Jim Bakker in “The Eyes of Tammy Faye,” chronicling the couple’s rise and fall.
The Oscar triumph for Chastain, 45, virtually unrecognizable in heavy makeup as Tammy Faye Bakker, followed a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance and capped the third Academy Award nomination of her career.
But their lucrative empire crumbled in a series of highly publicized sex and financial scandals in 1987, ending with Jim Bakker’s conviction and imprisonment on multiple fraud charges and the couple’s divorce.
Tammy Faye later married and took the last name of developer Roe Messner as she rebuilt her reputation through a documentary and reality show before her cancer death in 2007.
Assuming Bakker’s rapid-fire speech and girlish, Midwestern-accented voice, Chastain also made her big-screen singing debut in the film, performing a number of Bakker’s gospel tunes.
