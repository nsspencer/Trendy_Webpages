     Ariana DeBose wins best supporting actress Oscar for ‘West Side Story’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Ben KellermanLOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Ariana DeBose won her first Academy Award on Sunday for her supporting role as Anita in Steven Spielberg’s remake of classic musical “West Side Story.”A relative newcomer to feature films, 31-year-old DeBose earned mainstream acclaim for her lively portrayal of Anita, an outspoken Puerto Rican woman who showcases her singing and dancing talents in the song “America.”She also won a Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild award and British Academy Film Award for her performance.
“It was the summer of a lifetime and I am most privileged and grateful to spend it with all of you,” DeBose said in accepting her award.
“I am America,” she told OUT Magazine in November 2021.
“I am damn near a member of just about every marginalized community.”This is the second time the role of Anita has earned the best supporting actress award: Rita Moreno in 1962 became the first Latina actress to win an Oscar for her performance in the original “West Side Story.” Moreno, 90, joined Spielberg’s remake as drugstore owner Valentina, a new character written just for her.
DeBose’s fellow supporting actress nominees were Kirsten Dunst for “Power of the Dog,” Aunjanue Ellis for “King Richard,” Judi Dench for “Belfast” and Jessie Buckley for “The Lost Daughter.”(Reporting by Ben Kellerman and Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Howard Goller)

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES (AP) — Ariana DeBose lived up to Oscar predictions and her “West Side Story” predecessor Rita Moreno.
DeBose won the best supporting actress trophy Sunday for her breakout performance as the fierce Anita, 60 years after Moreno claimed the award in 1962 for the original film version of the Broadway musical.
Moreno was an Oscar pioneer, the first Latina to win an acting award.
DeBose is a groundbreaker in her own right, the first Afro-Latina and openly LGBTQ actor to win in the category.
“She just said, ‘Enjoy it, honey!’” DeBose told AP.

     Summary: Ariana DeBose makes history with a best supporting actress winEnlarge this image toggle caption Neilson Barnard/Getty Images Neilson Barnard/Getty ImagesSixty years ago, Rita Moreno became the first Latina to win an Oscar, given for the role of Anita in West Side Story.
Today, Ariana DeBose won best supporting actress for the same role, becoming part of an elite club of Oscar-winners who've received the accolade for playing the same character.
DeBose, however, told NPR in a 2021 interview that she believes the film got it right.
"It is not every day that an Afro-Latina gets to be part of the main event," DeBose told NPR.
She was nominated for a Tony for Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role in a Musical for her role in Summer: The Donna Summer Musical.
