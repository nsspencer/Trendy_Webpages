     Road to the Oscars: CODA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Siân Heder adapted the French film, La Famille Belier (2014) into an undeniably sweet American remake, titled CODA (Child of Deaf Adults).
Both of her parents, Frank (Troy Kotsur) and Jackie (Marlee Matlin), as well as her older brother Leo (Daniel Durant) are deaf.
One thing to appreciate about CODA is the inclusion of actual deaf actors, which makes it feel all the more authentic.
CODA is sweet, and the inclusion of the deaf community is much appreciated, but the familiar story doesn’t do it any favors.
Compared to other Oscar-nominated movies, CODA just doesn’t approach that level of quality and craft required to compete against something like Dune or The Power of the Dog, given that its only real strength relies on the unique family dynamic and ensemble chemistry.

     Troy Kotsur's Road to ‘CODA': Inside the Actor's Historic Oscars Journey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No matter the language, it's easy to understand love, and Troy Kotsur's Oscar-nominated performance in "CODA" has captured the hearts of audiences.
But when Kotsur was 17, his dad was hit by a drunk driver and paralyzed from the neck down.
"My father was unable to sign or communicate with me any longer," Kotsur said on the podcast through an ASL interpreter.
He's married to his wife Jackie (Matlin), and they have two kids: Leo (Daniel Durant) and Ruby (Emilia Jones).
"It means that our peers are accepting our work as artists not because we're deaf, we're just actors who happen to be deaf.

     It was a smash hit at Sundance. Will ‘CODA’ pull off a history-making upset at the Oscars?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When “CODA” had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival last year, it didn’t get thunderous applause or a standing ovation from the crowd.
And unlike the 2014 award-winning French film it is based on, “CODA” director Sian Heder actually cast deaf actors in her film.
“I hope that this opens the door to people getting that audiences want to see these kinds of stories,” Heder said while accepting the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival.
Beyond the awards, though, the film — which features a mostly deaf cast — is proving to be groundbreaking in terms of representation.
Not relegated to the background, like we’ve ticked this box.”But although the cast is mostly deaf, “CODA” isn’t just about deafness.

     Coda review: Why this year’s feel-good favourite should win the Oscar for Best Picture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CODA, an honest and sincere drama about a hearing child in a deaf family, was something of an underdog when it first premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2021.
The Power of the Dog may still be in the lead at Sunday’s ceremony, with 12 Oscar nominations and a Bafta for Best Film in its back pocket, but CODA could conceivably pull off a Best Picture win despite only featuring in two other categories on the night.
The backlash to CODA’s Best Picture buzz seems largely out of touch with the true, material impact of the Oscars.
And, if CODA wins, it’ll matter because of the opportunities it will create for other majority deaf casts.
CODA allows its hearing audience only one moment of concession, as the sound cuts out midway through one of Ruby’s performances.

     Is "CODA" the "Green Book" of films about deaf people?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She decides her dream is music, something her deaf family — according to the film — could never understand.
But despite phenomenal performances by all the actors, "CODA" isn't the movie deaf and Hard of Hearing people have been waiting for.
The premise of "CODA" is troubling on paper: A deaf family whose hearing kid sings (cue the rimshot)!
But this movie is touted and celebrated as a "deaf" movie.
But "CODA" is not a movie by deaf people, and I would argue it's not for those of us who are deaf, either.
