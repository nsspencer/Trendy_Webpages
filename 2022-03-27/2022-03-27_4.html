     Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes on Hosting the Oscars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And asked how they would top Glenn Close doing “Da Butt” at last year’s Oscars, Sykes had an idea: “We’re going to try to get Judi Dench to do the Worm.”These are edited excerpts from our interview.
WANDA SYKES If they had come to me and said, hey, do you want to host the Oscars by yourself, I would have said hell no, absolutely not.
REGINA HALL I was excited that Will Packer and Shayla Cowan were at the helm.
But then when I heard Wanda, I thought, “Wait a minute — now that sounds fun.” And then Amy.
I don’t think that things have to move completely smoothly to be wonderful.

     Summary: Photo: Neilson Barnard/Getty ImagesRegina Hall vocalized all of our thirst for a shirtless, sparkly blazer-clad Timotheé Chalamet during the 2022 Oscars ceremony.
Hall —who is co-hosting the awards with Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes — announced that a few lucky attendees needed to take an additional COVID test with her… backstage.
When Tyler Perry, Chalamet, and Simu Liu were also summoned, it hit me: this isn’t the Oscars.
This is just Regina Hall’s dating show.
And then I’m going to swab the back of your mouth with my tongue,” Hall joked.

Sykes said she has watched Power of the Dog three times and is “halfway through it.” Lady Gaga, they said, was snubbed for her performance in House of Random Accents.
And in one of the more topical references, Sykes said, “For you people in Florida we’re going to have a gay night.

     Summary: Watch : Why Regina Hall Won't Be Roasting Anyone at Oscars 2022Apparently, online dating has gotten so bleak that Regina Hall used the Oscars stage to shoot her shot with some of Hollywood's leading men.
While hosting the 2022 Oscars on March 27, Regina delivered a hilarious bit by recruiting our crushes—her, they're her crushes—to join her on stage so she could "swab" their mouths with her own tongue.
The Girls Trip star, 51, first dropped the hint that she was "single" at the start of the show.
She later announced that some of the attendees' COVID-19 tests had gotten lost, and she needed a few select guests to come up for another test.
"Unfortunately, some of the test results have gotten lost," Regina shared.
