     Phil Collins Says Goodbye To Fans After Final Performance With Genesis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phil Collins has bid farewell to fans after what’s said to be his final performance with Genesis, closing the book on a rock journey that began in the late 1960s and extended through the next six decades.
On Saturday, March 26, Collins and Genesis bandmates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks performed at London’s O2 Arena, the final show on the band’s The Last Domino tour.
Ensuing complications have left him seated while singing, and preventing him from playing drums and piano (his son, Nic Collins, took over the band’s drum duties for the final tour).

“It’s the last stop of our tour, and it’s the last show for Genesis,” Collins told the audience at the 20,000-seat venue.
