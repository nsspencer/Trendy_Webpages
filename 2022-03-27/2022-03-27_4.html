     Indiana Pacers and Toronto Raptors game suspended due to arena fire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) — Saturday night’s NBA game between the Indiana Pacers and the Toronto Raptors was briefly suspended following a fire at Toronto’s Scotiabank Arena, fire officials said.
The game was abruptly paused with 4:05 remaining in the second quarter due to a fire in an overhead speaker, the Raptors and Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment said in a statement.
The Raptors won the game 131-91.
“MLSE and the Toronto Raptors thank Toronto Fire Services and Toronto Police Services for their assistance and thank all fans for their patience and orderly evacuation,” the statement from the team said.
Repairs at the arena are expected to be completed in time for the NHL’s Toronto Maple Leafs to host the Florida Panthers Sunday as scheduled, officials said.

     Raptors-Pacers Game Delayed by Fire; Fans Evacuated From Arena
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Toronto Raptors' victory over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night was delayed about 70 minutes in the second quarter and the arena evacuated because of a fire in a speaker hanging over the stands.
Players headed to their locker rooms with 4:05 left in the second quarter and the Raptors leading 66-38.
About a half-hour after the game was paused, a Raptors spokesperson said the team had consulted with Toronto Fire Services and hoped play could resume without fans in 30 or 40 minutes.
The Raptors played to no more than a few hundred fans at home games between Dec. 31 and Mar.
Eventually, Kuhn announced that the building was being evacuated at the order of Toronto Fire Services, telling booing fans that the game had been suspended.
