     Sean Penn says he'll 'smelt' his Oscars if Zelensky isn't allowed to speak at the Academy Awards
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actor Sean Penn, who is in Poland filming a documentary about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, told CNN's Jim Acosta on Saturday that he will "smelt" his two Oscars "in public" if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not permitted to speak via video link at Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony.
Zelensky, Penn said, embodies the "poetic courage ... that film aspires at its best" to express.
ICYMI: Actor Sean Penn says the Oscars should be boycotted if the ceremony’s planners have decided against having Zelensky on the program.
Penn, who co-founded the disaster relief organization CORE, has won Best Actor Oscars for Mystic River (2003) and Milk (2008).
Technically, "smelting bronze" refers to the process of producing bronze from cooper and tin and/or arsenic, not the process of melting bronze down.

     Sean Penn Claims He’ll ‘Smelt’ His Oscars in Public If Zelensky Isn’t Invited to Speak at Academy Awards
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the biggest questions looming over tonight’s Academy Awards is how the show will address Ukraine.
In the midst of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of the nation, much of Hollywood has tried to show solidarity with Ukraine.
Speaking to CNN, Penn called on the Academy to make an effort to include Zelensky in the ceremony.
I myself, if it comes back to it, when I return, I will smelt mine in public,” Penn said.
“I pray that’s not what happened.

ICYMI: Actor Sean Penn says the Oscars should be boycotted if the ceremony’s planners have decided against having Zelensky on the program.
If we allow it to fight alone, our soul as America is lost,” he said in a statement to The Washington Post last month.
In a historic move this month, the International Chess Federation pulled tournaments from Russia and Belarus.
Days later, it banned one of the world’s top chess players for publicly voicing support for Putin.

     Summary: Actor Sean Penn says he will destroy his Academy Award if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy isn't allowed to speak during the broadcast.
In an interview with CNN, Penn, 61, said having Zelenskyy speak during Sunday's broadcast was of the utmost importance.
He said if Zelenskyy isn't given the floor for an address during the broadcast, Penn will destroy his own Oscar.
During the interview, Penn reminded viewers that Zelenskyy is also a fellow thespian with a long career in the arts.
Earlier this month, Netflix announced that the popular political satire TV series, “Servant of the People,” in which Zelenskyy stars, would returned to the streaming platform.

     Summary: Sean Penn has described any potential lack of backing by the Academy Awards for the Ukrainian people as “the most obscene moment in all of Hollywood history”.
“There is nothing greater that the Academy Awards could do than to give [Zelenskiy] an opportunity to talk to all of us,” Penn said.
“But it’s not me producing the Oscars.” Other sources reported that Zelenskiy had declined an invitation to contribute via Zoom.
Penn urged a widespread boycott of the event should it be confirmed that no approach to Zelenskiy had been made.
The 94th Academy Awards return to the Dolby theatre in Hollywood amid continued uncertainty over the attendance of nominees recently diagnosed with Covid.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two-time Oscar-winning actor Sean Penn sent a message to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in an interview with CNN’s Jim Acosta on Saturday.
(The Academy declined to comment to the news outlet and ABC did not respond, according to the Post.)
It is unknown if, should it happen, whether he would appear live via satellite or send a taped message.
Previously, Oscars co-host Amy Schumer said that she wants Zelenskyy to appear, but that it isn’t her call to make.
Penn, once known for lines like “hey, bud, let’s party,” is now making a documentary about the conflict for Vice Studios.

     Sean Penn threatens to ‘smelt’ Oscars if Ukraine’s Zelenskyy doesn’t get chance to speak at Academy Awards

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (NEXSTAR) – Actor and filmmaker Sean Penn is calling for a boycott – and even threatening to smelt his own awards – of Sunday’s Academy Awards if Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy isn’t given the opportunity to speak during the show.
“There is nothing greater the Academy Awards could do than to give [Zelenskyy] that opportunity to talk to all of us,” Penn, speaking from Poland, said during an interview with CNN.
The 61-year-old has been in Ukraine filming a documentary on Russia’s invasion.
Penn continued, saying it is his understanding that the Academy had decided against having Zelenskyy speak.
“If it turns out to be what’s happening, I would encourage everyone involved to know that though it may be their moment … to celebrate their films, it is so much more importantly their moment to shine and to protest and to boycott that Academy Awards,” he added.
