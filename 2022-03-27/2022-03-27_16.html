     Lakers blow 20-point halftime lead, lose to Pelicans and fall to 10th place in West

     Summary: Inside the building where the Lakers blew a 20-point halftime lead before losing to New Orleans 116-108, the signs were even more obvious.
They opened the game by scoring 12 straight points, James scoring 10 while smothering the Pelicans with defensive intensity normally reserved for the playoffs.
After the game, James took out his phone to show reporters the play in slow motion.
Lakers star LeBron James scores over New Orleans Pelicans forward Herbert Jones during the second half Sunday.
Like the way James hobbled on the court and later in the back hallways, it was obvious.

     Ingram scores 26 in return, Pelicans top Lakers 116-108
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Pelicans' leading scorer not only played well, but helped spearhead a dramatic comeback against the Los Angeles Lakers, who can't seem to catch a break lately.
Ingram scored 26 in his return from a 10-game absence, and the Pelicans rallied from 23 points down late in the second quarter to defeat the Lakers 116-108 on Sunday night.
He scored most of his points after twisting his left ankle early in the second quarter when he landed on Pelicans center Jaxson Hayes' foot.
â€œI have no idea how I finished the game," James said.
James' sixth 3 â€” from 27 feet â€” gave him 23 points with about four minutes left in the second quarter and gave the Lakers a 60-40 lead.
