In addition to the forthcoming red carpet looks at tonight’s Oscar ceremony, there has been a slew of stylish fetes hosted by all of the biggest fashion houses.

Chastain wore a black velvet Peter Pan-collared Gucci dress (perhaps a preview of what she’ll wear tonight?)

     Jessica Chastain arrives at Oscars early to cheer on pre-broadcast awards
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some stars, including Jessica Chastain, have said they won’t do red carpet interviews if it means missing the presentation of awards like best hair and makeup.
LOS ANGELES — "The Eyes of Tammy Faye” nominee Jessica Chastain arrived early to Sunday’s Oscars to ensure she didn’t miss the presentation of some less-celebrated awards.
Some stars, including Chastain, have said they won’t do red carpet interviews if it means missing the presentation of awards like best hair and makeup, for which the artists of “Tammy Faye” are nominated.
“I’m here to see all the early categories because so often a lot of attention goes to the actors because people see our faces on screen,” Chastain said on the red carpet.
Meanwhile, the producer of the Academy Awards says Sunday’s show will strike a balance between being upbeat and fun, while also acknowledging the war in Ukraine.
