     Summary: It was the Celtics’ sixth win in a row, and they led by at least 20 points in each.
Then the Celtics mostly shrugged and continued their onslaught from earlier.
The Timberwolves caught fire near the start of the third quarter of their Sunday game against the Celtics, drilling four 3-pointers in two minutes.
Observations from the game:⋅ The Celtics try to catch opponents sleeping by moving quickly on dead-ball inbounds plays, and they put a real emphasis on it against Minnesota.
On one play, Robert Williams out-fought four Timberwolves in the paint for an offensive rebound before throwing down a dunk as he was fouled.

Ime Udoka, Coach of the YearThe case for Udoka: Udoka has been instrumental in spearheading one of the greatest turnarounds in NBA history.
Marcus Smart, Defensive Player of the YearThe case for Smart: Smart is the arguably best defensive player on arguably the best defensive team, and that should unquestionably count for something.
Robert Williams, Defensive Player of the YearThe case for Williams: Williams is the more traditional type of winner for Defensive Player of the Year.
Advertisement:The case against Williams: Smart, Williams, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Al Horford are almost too good as a unit defensively that they cancel one another out.
