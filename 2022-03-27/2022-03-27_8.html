     Summary: The Kansas Jayhawks, the last No.
“I’ve thought all along that [the Final Four] was a possibility,” Kansas coach Bill Self said.
Kansas turned into the team that earned that seed, unfettered by the moment, flinging passes with abandon and using its size to dictate the margins of play.
As Self explained it: “Two good plays turned into four, turned into eight, turned into 16.
That was about as well as we could play.”And 16 teams turned into eight teams, turned into four.

     Summary: Photo Gallery Kansas Basketball v. Miami (Elite 8) View a photo gallery from the Jayhawks' Elite 8 matchup against Miami in Chicago.
Kansas outscored Miami 47-15 in the second half and that set the stage for the celebration of the season.
With Kansas leading 45-40 and in full-on attack mode on both ends, David McCormack wrestled the rebound away from Miami big man Sam Waardenburg and immediately went right back up.
After the second one, the KU senior turned to the United Center stands and waved his hands as if to say, “It’s over.”Truth be told, it was over the minute the second half started.
They proved that one more time during Sunday’s second half, forcing misses and miscues by the Hurricanes and capitalizing on them immediately with relentless transition offense.

     Summary: “For whatever reason, the lid came off the second half and the intensity picked up defensively,” Self said.
His only two threes of the game came during the second half.
But that was an impressive start of the second half, to go from down six to tie it in, what, two minutes?
“I thought David was fabulous, especially the start of the second half,” Self said.
“The second half, I don’t know what it was, but we controlled the defensive glass and their shooting percentage went down.

     Summary: 1 Kansas used a strong second half to erase a halftime deficit and ultimately put away No.
"We were locked in defensively the second half," Self said in his postgame interview with CBS.
And they were somehow even better against Miami in the second half as Kansas held Miami to just 15 second-half points and 0.417 points per possession.
But thanks to that killer instinct, and Kansas making better than 59% of its second half shots, it won the second half 47-15.
And the guys didn't really worry about the distractions of what was going on in the first half, they just played the second half."
