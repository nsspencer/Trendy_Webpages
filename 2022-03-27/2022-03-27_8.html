     Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes on Hosting the Oscars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And asked how they would top Glenn Close doing “Da Butt” at last year’s Oscars, Sykes had an idea: “We’re going to try to get Judi Dench to do the Worm.”These are edited excerpts from our interview.
WANDA SYKES If they had come to me and said, hey, do you want to host the Oscars by yourself, I would have said hell no, absolutely not.
REGINA HALL I was excited that Will Packer and Shayla Cowan were at the helm.
But then when I heard Wanda, I thought, “Wait a minute — now that sounds fun.” And then Amy.
I don’t think that things have to move completely smoothly to be wonderful.

     Oscars Monologue Roasts ‘Don’t Say Gay’ Bill, the Golden Globes and Non-Televised Categories
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oscars hosts Amy Schumer, Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes brought the heat during their opening monologue on Sunday, making jokes about everything from the Golden Globes to Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill to the Oscars themselves.
I’d still smash.”The monologue also looked inward to the Oscars themselves, specifically regarding the Academy’s decision to present eight craft categories ahead of the live broadcast this year.
The choice was met with fierce backlash from many in Hollywood, although the Academy stuck by its decision.
“As many of you know, a decision was made to present some behind-the-scenes awards in the first hour,” Schumer said.
He’s done so much to fight climate change and leave behind a cleaner, greener planet for his girlfriends,” she joked.
