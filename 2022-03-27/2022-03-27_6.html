     Summary: Ariana DeBose won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Anita in Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of “West Side Story.” It is her first Academy Award.
DeBose is also the first openly queer star to win an acting Oscar.
In accepting the award, DeBose made reference to being a queer woman of color and said:Imagine this little girl in the back seat of a white Ford Focus.
You see a queer — openly queer — woman of color, an Afro-Latina, who found her strength in life through art, and that’s what I believe we are here to celebrate.
The actress-singer-dancer has also been nominated for a Tony for her role as Donna Summer in the short-lived musical “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical.”DeBose will next be seen in Matthew Vaughn’s spy movie, “Argylle,” for Apple TV+.

     Ariana DeBose wins best supporting actress Oscar for ‘West Side Story’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Ben KellermanLOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Ariana DeBose won her first Academy Award on Sunday for her supporting role as Anita in Steven Spielberg’s remake of classic musical “West Side Story.”A relative newcomer to feature films, 31-year-old DeBose earned mainstream acclaim for her lively portrayal of Anita, an outspoken Puerto Rican woman who showcases her singing and dancing talents in the song “America.”She also won a Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild award and British Academy Film Award for her performance.
“It was the summer of a lifetime and I am most privileged and grateful to spend it with all of you,” DeBose said in accepting her award.
“I am America,” she told OUT Magazine in November 2021.
“I am damn near a member of just about every marginalized community.”This is the second time the role of Anita has earned the best supporting actress award: Rita Moreno in 1962 became the first Latina actress to win an Oscar for her performance in the original “West Side Story.” Moreno, 90, joined Spielberg’s remake as drugstore owner Valentina, a new character written just for her.
DeBose’s fellow supporting actress nominees were Kirsten Dunst for “Power of the Dog,” Aunjanue Ellis for “King Richard,” Judi Dench for “Belfast” and Jessie Buckley for “The Lost Daughter.”(Reporting by Ben Kellerman and Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Howard Goller)

     Summary: Ariana DeBose makes history with a best supporting actress winEnlarge this image toggle caption Neilson Barnard/Getty Images Neilson Barnard/Getty ImagesSixty years ago, Rita Moreno became the first Latina to win an Oscar, given for the role of Anita in West Side Story.
Today, Ariana DeBose won best supporting actress for the same role, becoming part of an elite club of Oscar-winners who've received the accolade for playing the same character.
DeBose, however, told NPR in a 2021 interview that she believes the film got it right.
"It is not every day that an Afro-Latina gets to be part of the main event," DeBose told NPR.
She was nominated for a Tony for Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role in a Musical for her role in Summer: The Donna Summer Musical.
