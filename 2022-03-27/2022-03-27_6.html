     Summary: “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” might not be up for any Oscars, but that doesn’t mean the infectious earworm didn’t steal the show.
Among the songs on the Lin-Manuel Miranda-composed soundtrack, “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” is by far the most popular one, hitting the top of the Billboard Top 100.
“It’s been played more times than ‘Happy Birthday,’” joked John Leguizamo, who plays the titular Bruno, as he presented the the performance.

     Oscars: ‘Encanto’ Team Celebrates “Beautiful, Diverse Characters” With Best Animated Feature Win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Merino said she was so proud to work on a film that “put beautiful, diverse characters front and center.” The team thanked the people of Colombia and the team at Disney Animation for their support.
The best animated feature category was first presented at the Academy Awards in 2002.
Encanto marks the fourth win for Walt Disney Animation Studios, which also won Oscars for Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia.
Combined with 11 wins from sister company Pixar, parent company Disney can now claim 15 best animated feature Oscars.
In the animated feature race, Encanto topped a field that also included Disney’s Raya and the Last Dragon; Disney/Pixar’s Luca; Sony Pictures Animation and Netflix’s The Mitchells vs. the Machines; and Flee from Neon and Participant, which made Oscar history as the first movie nominated for best animated feature, best documentary and best international feature.

     Why the Oscars dissed Encanto’s ‘We Don’t Talk About Bruno’
    </h2>

     Summary: Can we talk about how the Oscars dissed “Bruno”?
That’s right, “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” — that “Encanto” earworm that topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks, becoming only the second No.
Disney submitted the “Encanto” tune “Dos Oruguitas” instead of “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” for Oscars consideration.
©Walt Disney Co./Courtesy EvereBut it’s not the Oscars’ fault for overlooking “Bruno.” The song — which, like “Dos Oruguitas,” was written by Lin-Manuel Miranda — was not submitted for nomination by Disney.
A scene from the Disney animated hit “Encanto.” ©Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Evere“I’m still proud of ‘Dos Oruguitas’ as the submission,” Miranda, who was unable to attend the ceremony, told Variety.
