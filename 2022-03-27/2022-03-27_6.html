    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Neilson Barnard/Getty ImagesBillie Eilish and FINNEAS took the Oscar stage Sunday night to perform their nominated song “No Time to Die,” from the James Bond film of the same name.
With FINNEAS at the piano, Billie began the performance seated on a stool, wearing a voluminous black outfit and black hair.
Angular laser lights flanked her as she sang and eventually stood up to finish the haunting song.
The duo was introduced by Oscar-winner Rami Malek, who played the villain in No Time to Die.
Billie and FINNEAS have already won a Grammy and a Golden Globe for the song.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Billie Eilish and Finneas are always a package deal.
As siblings and creative partners, they make music, perform, and occasionally dominate the red carpet together, too.
This was certainly the case at tonight’s Oscars, where the pair are set to perform during the ceremony.
Eilish and Finneas hit the step and repeat in complementary looks by Gucci.
Eilish wore designer Alessandro Michele’s tiered, ruffled, off-the-shoulder gown with a dramatic train.

     Billie Eilish and Finneas Perform Searing Rendition of ‘No Time To Die’ at Oscars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier on Oscars night, Billie Eilish revealed that writing a song for the James Bond franchise had been a longtime dream for her and her brother, Finneas, who used to practice writing “Bond songs” just to see what they could come up with.
All of that practice paid off when the pair took to the stage to perform their 2020 song “No Time to Die” — a classic, string-laden noir ballad — which minutes later snagged the Best Original Song Oscar over Beyoncé’s “Be Alive,” Sebastián Yatra’s “Dos Oruguitas,” Van Morrison’s “Down to Joy,” and Reba McEntire’s “Somehow You Do.”“I should’ve known, I’d leave alone,” Eilish sang, her hair in a jet-black Sixties bob.
“Just goes to show that the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe.”Finneas’ piano lines wove around Eilish’s dazed falsetto.
They may be the youngest composers to write a Bond song, but this performance was proof they understood the assignment.

     Billie Eilish Wins Best Original Song at Oscars 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In-person performances made their return to Oscars 2022 after most of the original-song nominees were performed at the preshow of last year’s Academy Awards.
The trophy for best original-song went to Billie Eilish and Finneas, for “No Time to Die” from No Time to Die, while Hans Zimmer won best original score for Dune.
Prior to their win, Eilish and Finneas performed their song against a macabre backdrop after an introduction from Bond villain Rami Malek.
No musical tribute to 2021’s films would be complete without Encanto, which won the Oscar for best animated film.
The show also spotlighted “We Don’t Talk About Bruno,” an earworm of a song that has topped Billboard charts and pop-cultural conversation, despite not getting submitted for best original song.
