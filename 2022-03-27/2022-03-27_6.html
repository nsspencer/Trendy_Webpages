     Chris Wallace Says Life at Fox News Became ‘Unsustainable’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Before, I found it was an environment in which I could do my job and feel good about my involvement at Fox,” Mr. Wallace said of his time at the network.
“And since November of 2020, that just became unsustainable, increasingly unsustainable as time went on.”Still, he acknowledged that some viewers may wonder why he did not leave earlier.
Mr. Wallace said his new CNN+ series, which airs at 6 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, was inspired by the work of famed interviewers like Larry King and Charlie Rose.
The set of the show is sparse, just Mr. Wallace and a guest sitting on either side of a Plexiglas table — a more brightly lit version of Mr. Rose’s long-running PBS format.
The service, which costs $6 a month, debuts on Tuesday, years after the arrival of streaming competitors like Fox Nation and the CBS News Streaming Network.

     Chris Wallace On His Move To CNN+: “No Longer Felt Comfortable With The Programming At Fox”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Wallace spent nearly two decades at Fox News before shifting to the new streaming service, CNN+.
Wallace claimed Fox News shifted in the months following Donald Trump’s defeat in 2020.
He was also taken aback by Fox host Tucker Carlson’s take on the Jan. 6 uprising, and was disturbed by Carlson’s documentary, Patriot Purge, which defended the insurrection.
As a result, “I just no longer felt comfortable with the programming at Fox,” Wallace said.
“Before, I found it was an environment in which I could do my job and feel good about my involvement at Fox,” Wallace said of his time at the network.

     Chris Wallace: working at Fox News became ‘unsustainable’ after election
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Wallace has said working at Fox News became “increasingly unsustainable” before he jumped ship to CNN last December after almost 20 years with the right-leaning cable channel.
His departure dealt a blow to Fox’s news operation at a time when its opinion side had become preeminent.
“I’m fine with opinion: conservative opinion, liberal opinion.
But when people start to question the truth – ‘Who won the 2020 election?
He added: “Before, I found it was an environment in which I could do my job and feel good about my involvement at Fox.

     Summary: Chris Wallace says he left Fox News after people at the news organization began to question matters of truth, like the Jan. 6 insurrection and whether the 2020 election was stolen.
“I just no longer felt comfortable with the programming at Fox," Wallace told The New York Times in a recent interview.
“I’m fine with opinion: conservative opinion, liberal opinion,” Wallace told the Times.
“Some people might have drawn the line earlier, or at a different point,” Wallace told the Times.
“I think the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions,” Wallace told Trump.
