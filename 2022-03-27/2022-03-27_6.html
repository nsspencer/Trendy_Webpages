    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON : Following are reactions to U.S. President Joe Biden's remark on Saturday that Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin "cannot remain in power".
BIDEN"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," Biden told a crowd in Warsaw after condemning the Russian president's month-long war in Ukraine.
Biden cast Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a battle in a much broader conflict between democracy and autocracy.
"The battle for democracy could not conclude and did not conclude with the end of the Cold War," Biden said.
