     Biden Says Putin ‘Cannot Remain in Power’

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Omar Marques/Getty ImagesDuring a major speech in Warsaw, Poland, on Saturday, President Joe Biden said that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” appearing to endorse regime change in Russia, though the White House quickly tried to walk back the apparent ad lib.
“The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.
He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change,” a White House official claimed in a statement.
At The Atlantic, Tom Nichols called Biden’s comment a potentially consequential unforced error:What Biden was doing, of course, was being Joe Biden.
