     Billie Eilish &amp; Finneas O'Connell Win Best Original Song, Diane Warren Loses For The 13th Time
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell’s No Time To Die has won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 2022 Oscars.
“No Time To Die” beat out Beyoncé’s “Be Alive” (from King Richard), the Lin-Manuel Miranda-penned “Dos Oruguitas” (from Encanto), Van Morrison’s “Down To Joy” (from Belfast), and Reba McEntire’s “Somehow You Do” from Four Good Days, which was written by Diane Warren.
Warren’s “Somehow You Do” nomination was the 13th time that the songwriter had been nominated and lost Best Original Song at the Academy Awards.
Her first nomination was for the chart-topping Mannequin song “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” back in 1988.
In her speech Eilish thanked Johnny Marr, who performed on the track, “for taking our song and making it worthy of James Bond.” Earlier in the night, she and Finneas performed the track at the ceremony.

     Summary: Neilson Barnard/Getty ImagesBillie Eilish and FINNEAS took the Oscar stage Sunday night to perform their nominated song “No Time to Die,” from the James Bond film of the same name.
With FINNEAS at the piano, Billie began the performance seated on a stool, wearing a voluminous black outfit and black hair.
Angular laser lights flanked her as she sang and eventually stood up to finish the haunting song.
The duo was introduced by Oscar-winner Rami Malek, who played the villain in No Time to Die.
Billie and FINNEAS have already won a Grammy and a Golden Globe for the song.

     Billie Eilish Is First Oscar Winner Born in 21st Century

     Summary: Billie Eilish has set a number of records in scoring a Best Original Song Oscar for “No Time to Die,” including being the first person born in the 21st century to win an Academy Award.
At age 20, she’s not the youngest-ever songwriting winner, however.
And she still would have been a few months younger than Irglová at the stripped-down ceremony that was eventually held in April.
Eilish and her 24-year-old brother Finneas have also become the first American songwriters to win for writing an original James Bond song.
An incredulous Eilish showed off the Oscar, exclaiming, “Whoa.

     Billie Eilish Wins Best Original Song at Oscars 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In-person performances made their return to Oscars 2022 after most of the original-song nominees were performed at the preshow of last year’s Academy Awards.
The trophy for best original-song went to Billie Eilish and Finneas, for “No Time to Die” from No Time to Die, while Hans Zimmer won best original score for Dune.
Prior to their win, Eilish and Finneas performed their song against a macabre backdrop after an introduction from Bond villain Rami Malek.
No musical tribute to 2021’s films would be complete without Encanto, which won the Oscar for best animated film.
The show also spotlighted “We Don’t Talk About Bruno,” an earworm of a song that has topped Billboard charts and pop-cultural conversation, despite not getting submitted for best original song.

     Summary: Earlier on Oscars night, Billie Eilish revealed that writing a song for the James Bond franchise had been a longtime dream for her and her brother, Finneas, who used to practice writing “Bond songs” just to see what they could come up with.
They may be the youngest composers to write a Bond song, but this performance was proof they understood the assignment.
Really, just like picking their brains about it … It was really important to us that it felt like a Billie Eilish song and a James Bond song at the same time, and not one or the other,” Finneas said.
“I just really wanted [Daniel Craig] to love it.
He’s James Bond.”
