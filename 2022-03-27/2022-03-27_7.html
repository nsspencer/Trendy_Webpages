     Summary: CODA's Troy Kotsur is now the first Deaf man to win an Oscar for actingEnlarge this image toggle caption Neilson Barnard/Getty Images Neilson Barnard/Getty ImagesTroy Kotsur is now the first man who is Deaf to win an Academy Award for acting, collecting the trophy for best actor in a supporting role.
His CODA costar, Marlee Matlin, was the first Deaf actor to win an Oscar back in 1987, receiving the best actress award for Children of a Lesser God.
"This is dedicated to the Deaf community, the CODA community and the disabled community," Kotsur signed in his acceptance speech.
In the film, Kotsur plays Frank Rossi, a fisherman in Gloucester, Mass., and the patriarch of a family whose wife and son are also Deaf.
He studied acting at Gallaudet University in Washington D.C., then toured with The National Theatre of the Deaf.

     It was a smash hit at Sundance. Now ‘CODA’ has won an Oscar for best picture
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When “CODA” had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival last year, it didn’t get thunderous applause or a standing ovation from the crowd.
And unlike the 2014 award-winning French film it is based on, “CODA” director Sian Heder actually cast deaf actors in her film.
Now, the coming-of-age drama has made history by being the first Sundance film to win an Oscar for best picture.

Not relegated to the background, like we’ve ticked this box.”But although the cast is mostly deaf, “CODA” isn’t just about deafness.

     What’s next for ‘CODA’? What we know about the stage musical in the works
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Can Deaf West Theatre’s artistic director, DJ Kurs, imagine Troy Kotsur reprising his Academy Award-winning role in the film “CODA” on Broadway?
Actor Troy Kotsur, from the film “CODA,” was the first deaf male actor to be nominated for an Oscar.
Kurs says Deaf West had its eyes on the “CODA” material long before the film’s massive success.
I knew that this would be a natural fit for the art form of musical theater,” writes Kurs.
“I had some conversations with Sian and the cast before the movie was made,” writes Kurs.

     Is "CODA" the "Green Book" of films about deaf people?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She decides her dream is music, something her deaf family — according to the film — could never understand.
But despite phenomenal performances by all the actors, "CODA" isn't the movie deaf and Hard of Hearing people have been waiting for.
The premise of "CODA" is troubling on paper: A deaf family whose hearing kid sings (cue the rimshot)!
But this movie is touted and celebrated as a "deaf" movie.
But "CODA" is not a movie by deaf people, and I would argue it's not for those of us who are deaf, either.

     Apple's Oscar-winner CODA brings you into an inner world of sign
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oscar-winner Troy Kotsur, one of the stars of Apple's movie CODA, is known as a great signer.
It has as many scenes in American Sign Language as those in spoken English.
And during singular moments of CODA, the film lets sign speak for itself.
Voicing the word "ejaculation" in a movie wouldn't force the MPA to slap an R rating on a movie, Heder argued.
When Ruby can't figure out how to explain it in her second language, English, she turns to her first language, sign, to answer.
