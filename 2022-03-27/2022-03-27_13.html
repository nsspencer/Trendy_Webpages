     Raptors Notes: Delayed Game, VanVleet, Boucher
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Raptors have faced some odd circumstances over the past two years, but nobody had seen anything like what happened Saturday night, writes Josh Lewenberg of TSN.
About four minutes before halftime in a game with the Pacers, emergency workers began clearing fans from a section of Scotiabank Arena after an electrical fire broke out in an overhead speaker.
Eventually, all the spectators had to leave and the players finished the game without fans after a delay of about an hour.
“I started sneezing and that’s when I was like, ‘There’s something in the air,’” Precious Achiuwa said.
“Just add it to the list,” coach Nick Nurse said after Saturday’s game.

     Raptors-Pacers Game Delayed by Fire; Fans Evacuated From Arena
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Toronto Raptors' victory over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night was delayed about 70 minutes in the second quarter and the arena evacuated because of a fire in a speaker hanging over the stands.
Players headed to their locker rooms with 4:05 left in the second quarter and the Raptors leading 66-38.
About a half-hour after the game was paused, a Raptors spokesperson said the team had consulted with Toronto Fire Services and hoped play could resume without fans in 30 or 40 minutes.
The Raptors played to no more than a few hundred fans at home games between Dec. 31 and Mar.
Eventually, Kuhn announced that the building was being evacuated at the order of Toronto Fire Services, telling booing fans that the game had been suspended.

     Summary: (CNN) — Saturday night’s NBA game between the Indiana Pacers and the Toronto Raptors was briefly suspended following a fire at Toronto’s Scotiabank Arena, fire officials said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was the mistake the Toronto Raptors have been trying to break him of this season.
When Fred VanVleet drove to the rim and kicked the ball out to the 6-foot-8 forward in the corner for a wide-open shot, Achiuwa needed to go up with it.
Indiana Pacers guard Terry Taylor closed out short on his shot defense, figuring that Achiuwa wouldn't take the three.
"Literally three guys on the bench are like you’ve got to shoot that, you have to," Achiuwa said.
All it is is just your teammates having that trust in you, honestly."

     Raptors' Precious Achiuwa reveals secret to growth as 3-point shooter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Achiuwa's growth as a 3-point shooter has been one of the most encouraging developments for the Raptors this season, especially given the fact that he missed the lone 3-point attempt of his rookie season in Miami.
NBA LEAGUE PASS: Sign up to unlock live out-of-market games (7-day free trial)This season, Achiuwa has developed into a 36.1 percent 3-point shooter, a figure that has risen to 39.6 percent in the month of March.
When asked about his growth as a shooter, Achiuwa indicated that it was a product of work and the belief of his teammates and coaches.
After not making a 3-pointer as a rookie, Achiuwa has now hit two or more 3s on 11 different occasions this season.
With Achiuwa taking this broad of a leap in just his first year in the Raptors' system, the sky is the limit for his development as an all-around player — and 3-point shooter — in Toronto.
