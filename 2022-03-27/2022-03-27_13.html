     Rachel Zegler Joked About Oscars 2022 Invite While Presenting With Jacob Elordi
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rachel Zegler addressed the elephant in the room — her belated invitation to the Academy Awards – while presenting the award for visual effects at Oscars 2022.
She took the stage with Euphoria star Jacob Elordi to present the award, playing off Jacob's opening sentence.
“I will root for ‘West Side Story’ from my couch and be proud of the work we so tirelessly did 3 years ago.
I hope some last-minute miracle occurs and I can celebrate our film in person but hey, that’s how it goes sometimes, I guess.
Meanwhile, Twitter couldn't help making a few jokes about the chaotic height difference between Jacob, who is 6'5", and Rachel, who is much shorter.

     After invite mess, ‘West Side Story’ star Rachel Zegler makes her Oscars debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “West Side Story” breakout Rachel Zegler looked oh so pretty on the Oscars red carpet after finally receiving a ticket to Hollywood’s biggest night.
The rising movie star — who was finally invited to attend the ceremony as a presenter after revealing she didn’t have a ticket to the show — made her Oscars debut Sunday in an elegant, black Dior gown.
In February, Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” received seven Oscar nominations — for director, cinematography, costume design, production design, sound, supporting actress and best picture.
Broadway star Ariana DeBose is favored to win the supporting actress prize for her acclaimed turn as Anita — the same role that landed Rita Moreno an Oscar in 1962.
In a full-circle moment, DeBose and Moreno also hit the Oscars red carpet together ahead of the show.

     Rachel Zegler Quips About Initial Invitation Snub In Presenting At The Oscars
    </h2>

     Summary: Jacob Elordi and Rachel Zegler speak onstage at the 94th Academy Awards held at Dolby Theatre on March 27th, 2022 in Los Angeles, California.
The power of social media was in full display last week when, an off-the-cuff Instagram comment by Rachel Zegler that she had not been invited to the Oscars went viral, with fans rallying behind the West Side Story star.
Zegler poked fun at the circumstances that brought her to the Oscar stage from London where she is filming the Disney feature Snow White.
Growing up in Australia I never thought that I would stand here on this stage,” Elordi said.
Added Zegler, “And I never thought I would be here six days ago.

     Summary: You don’t really expect that to make the news the next day -- and it was just a statement -- but we're here, we're happy, we're really thankful."
Pretty fast, in fact.”It was just last week when when Zegler took to Instagram and posted a picture of her evening gown.
A fan commented they couldn't wait until they saw her outfit at the Oscars, and that's when Zegler replied in the comments section.
The revelation drew outrage, especially considering that the Steven Spielberg-directed film is up for several awards, including Best Picture.
The backlash was so intense, Zegler took to social media and implored fans to "respect the process."

     Rachel Zegler Made It to the Oscars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One week after lamenting her lack of invitation, Rachel Zegler is at the Oscars.
Zegler joked about needing a gown to wear at the Oscars just five days ago, when she was officially announced as a presenter.
The actor also wore a Dior gown to the West Side Story premiere in December, making this Oscars red carpet a nice full-circle moment.
You’d think that making her feature debut in a movie nominated for Best Picture would have nabbed Zegler a seat at the Oscars, but alas!
But after revealing that she hadn’t been invited to the Oscars on Instagram, Zegler nabbed both a seat and a presenter gig at this year’s awards.
