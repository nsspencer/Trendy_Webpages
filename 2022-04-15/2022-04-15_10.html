     ‘Choose or Die’ Review: Press Start. Or Not.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Choose or Die” almost sounds like a marketing slogan for Netflix’s scroll of mediocrities — but no, it’s just another horror movie on the streaming service.
As horror movies go, you could choose better.
The source of the horror here is a 1980s computer game with a curse embedded in its coding.
In a prologue, the first player we see (Eddie Marsan), a collector of Reagan-era knickknacks, must choose whether he wants his son’s tongue or his wife’s ears cut off.
If he doesn’t choose — well, you get the idea.

     Choose or Die movie review &amp; film summary (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Iola Evans plays Kayla, a college student struggling with debt and a troubled mother on the edge of poverty.
“Curs&gt;r” is an old, Infocom-style text game, one of those early PC games in which players input text to push the story along.
Let’s just say that Kayla plays the first level at a diner and it ends with a poor waitress eating broken glass.
“Choose or Die” too often feels like it’s making itself up as it goes along.
A film like “Choose or Die” needs to either go completely off the rails in its hallucinatory visuals to pull you in or set up some rules for viewers and protagonists to follow.

     Choose or Die Ending Explained: The Curse, Kismet, and Kayla’s Fate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In Greek mythology the ferryman of Hades carried the souls of the dead from our living world to the world of the dead.
Beck maintains that this curse can be a gift, even while his lab rat gnaws his own arm off for beta test posterity.
An active vision of Beck suddenly graces the screen, and it appears that cheating at CURS&gt;R will lose Kayla a life.
The Boss BattleAt the start of Choose or Die we met Hal (Eddie Marsan), a father who hid himself away drinking and playing retro games while his wife and son bickered.
Putting them out into the world meant that the curse could spread, and other players took sufferer Hal’s place as the sufferees.

     Choose or Die review – gory Netflix video game horror
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s strange that the silly but mostly tolerable horror Choose or Die was an acquisition rather than a homegrown Netflix original given how much it seems algorithmically modeled for the notoriously formula-obsessed platform.
It also focuses on a cursed video game, making it a close cousin to the streamer’s interactive Black Mirror hit Bandersnatch.
The first encounter with the game sees Kayla playing in an empty diner, forced to watch a flirty waitress eat glass in front of her.
But while the gore is impressively visceral and well-realised, the rest of it is a few steps behind.
The script, from TV writer Simon Allen, acts as mostly just pedestrian framework for the game scenes, which thankfully do arrive quite often.

     Choose or Die review: Netflix takes the fun out of a killer video game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Early on in Netflix’s proudly derivative new horror film Choose or Die, a mother brandishing a kitchen knife bickers with her teenage son over his father’s obsession with the 1980s.
The fetishization of the 1980s — its trends and pop culture, especially movies and music — is recalibrated to frightening ends in Toby Meakins’ Choose or Die.
At 84 minutes, Choose or Die is a whip-bang film that rests on brisk, sturdy storytelling.
Choose or Die is best when Allen and Meakins blissfully design scares based around Kayla’s grief over her brother’s death.
Meakins’ Choose or Die could easily be the next grimly fun horror franchise, picking up where the sprawling Saw franchise or the Escape Room movies left off.

     ‘Choose or Die’ Review: A Cursed ’80s Video Game Bites Back in Clever Netflix Horror
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today’s popular user-driven experience gets a nostalgic 1980s makeover in “Choose or Die,” the terrifying refrain in a game with extremely high stakes.
The brisk and clever horror thriller pushes the idea of a cursed survival game to sinister ends, creating a world where every choice has cruel — and very real — consequences.
“Choose or Die” is a perfect entry point into genre for younger viewers, one that will also satisfy old school diehards even as it takes some pointed (perhaps deserved?)
The game can sense where someone is, but it can also hear and predict what the people playing will say and do.
It’s a dangerous game to play, but “Choose or Die” has leveled up.
