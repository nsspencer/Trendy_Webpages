     Somers: In the case of Kyler Murray vs. the Cardinals, it's hard to pick a side to cheer for
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everything about sports, including contract negotiations between a player and a team, is more fun when you pick a side to root for, but that’s become increasingly difficult with quarterback Kyler Murray and the Cardinals.
So far this year, their relationship has been like trying to fix a crack in a drywall ceiling.
The repair job looks good for a few weeks, but the crack always reappears, as it did this week with a report that Murray’s agent had rescinded a contract offer made six weeks or so after the season ended and that Murray wouldn't play without a new contract.

     In Booming QB Market, Kyler Murray Unlikely to Play For $5.5M
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyler Murray has apparently had enough of watching other quarterbacks get big contracts in this offseason’s explosive market.
1 pick is entering the fourth season of his rookie deal, which pays an undesirable $5.5 million.
In an offseason where four QBs signed contracts in excess of $40 million per season, there’s logic behind Murray’s potential holdout.
If he’s planning a different route, there’s Lamar Jackson — who seems content betting on himself and taking a more patient approach.
The self-repped QB hasn’t reached an agreement with the Ravens and will likely play out the $23 million, fifth-year option of his rookie contract.

Kyler Murray is back in our world.
With recent contract extension talks seemingly stalling, the Kyler Murray trade projections are starting to ramp up once more.
On top of that, CBS ranked the most likely destinations for Kyler Murray should he be traded.
The Houston Texans are better off without Kyler Murray.

     Kyler Murray Trade to Texans? Houston 'Would Explore,' Insists NFL Insider
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyler Murray trade gossip - and that is where your Houston Texans come in.
The Houston Texans just extricated themselves from a mess with an unhappy star QB.
Are they really interested in doing it all again - from the other side of the trade table?
The drama surrounding the Arizona Cardinals and star quarterback Kyler Murray continues on this offseason, with the club - despite insisting that it is completely committed to the former No.
That piece of actual news (from NFL Network insider Tom Pelissero) has spawned the expected "inside info'' ... or, maybe, just gossip.

     The Cardinals aren't listening to Kyler Murray and are flirting with disaster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And Murray knows all this for a fact, even after he restored all the Cardinals photos to his Instagram page.
— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) April 14, 2022You’d think Arizona would have any coherent strategy to keep their quarterback happy.
What’s more plausible: Do the Cardinals know what they’re doing with Murray, who has only recently started showing public discontent with his team?
Perhaps Murray has blindsided the Cardinals by being proactive in asking for an early massive contract extension.
— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) April 14, 2022My advice to them?
