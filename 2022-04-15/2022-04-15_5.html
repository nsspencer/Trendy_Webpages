     BREAKING: Stephon Gilmore Finds a New Home
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As expected, Stephon Gilmore will not be a Carolina Panther in 2022 as he will be signing with the Indianapolis Colts on a two-year deal, per multiple reports.
Earlier this offseason, Panthers GM Scott Fitterer told the media that if it were possible he would love to have both Donte Jackson and Gilmore back.
Stephon is so smart and is so good for that room.
It was a really good talk and much like Cam, he's looking for the right situation and these guys are highly competitive guys.
Gilmore was traded to the Panthers in 2021 by the New England Patriots in exchange for a 6th round pick.
