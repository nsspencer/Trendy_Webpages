     Indianapolis Colts signing CB Stephon Gilmore to two-year, $23M contract, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Indianapolis Colts are giving cornerback Stephon Gilmore a two-year, $23 million contract that includes $14 million guaranteed, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Gilmore becomes the second veteran addition to the Colts' secondary this week, after Indianapolis signed safety Rodney McLeod on Thursday.
Indianapolis' defense now features the five-time Pro Bowler Gilmore, Ngakoue and DeForest Buckner on the line, linebacker Darius Leonard, and one of the league's best slot corners in Kenny Moore.
Gilmore played the 2021 season with the Carolina Panthers, who traded a 2023 third-round pick to the New England Patriots in October to get him.
The 10th overall pick in the 2012 draft by the Bills, Gilmore has 27 interceptions and 116 passes defended in 10 seasons.

     Summary: Stephon Gilmore has made a decision on where his next NFL home will be.
That visit went very well, to say the least, as Gilmore has now agreed to terms on a deal that will put him in a Colts uniform for 2022 and beyond, per CBS Sports insider Josina Anderson.
Gilmore is expected to immediately make a massive impact in the Colts secondary, aided by the signing of Rodney McLeod only days ago.
"Smh," wrote All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey, via Twitter, following the news.
Things went south in New England as contract disputes took hold in the relationship, and Gilmore was eventually traded to the Carolina Panthers in 2021, where he'd earn the fifth Pro Bowl appearance.

The Colts were busy addressing the two needs Ballard identified as critical early this offseason through a trio of blockbuster trades.
Indianapolis will almost certainly fill a lot of those holes in the NFL draft.
