     Summary: Seven-time All-Star Paul George brought smiles back onto the faces of Clippers fans last month with his long-awaited return to the hardwood.
Those smiles, however, were short-lived as fans received news today that George has entered health and safety protocols, which will keep him out of the roster against the New Orleans Pelicans tonight.
Clippers star Paul George has entered health and safety protocols and will miss tonight's Play-in game vs. New Orleans, sources tell @TimBontemps and me.
Regardless, the Clippers will look to extend their season with a win against the Pelicans tonight.
If they lose, they’ll be eliminated from the play-in tournament.

     Summary: Clippers star Paul George will miss Friday night’s play-in tournament game vs. the Pelicans due to entering COVID-19 health and safety protocols, per ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski and Tim Bontemps.
It is unclear when George will be available again, if the Clippers advance into the playoffs.
George played in Tuesday night’s play-in tournament game vs. the Timberwolves, which the Clippers lost 109–104.
Now, the Clippers will be without their star in their most crucial game of the season.
George has averaged 24.3 points, 6.9 rebounds and 5.7 assists in an average of 34.7 minutes per game.

     Paul George to miss play-in game after positive coronavirus test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadLOS ANGELES — Los Angeles Clippers star Paul George will miss a do-or-die play-in game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday after entering the NBA’s coronavirus health and safety protocols.
The seven-time all-star scored a game-high 34 points in the Clippers’ 109-104 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in their first play-in game on Tuesday.
Clippers President Lawrence Frank said that George was symptomatic Thursday and that his coronavirus test returned a positive result Friday.
New Orleans defeated the 10th-place San Antonio Spurs, 113-103, on Wednesday in their first play-in game.
His impact on winning was clear this season: The Clippers were 18-13 with George in the lineup, and 24-27 without him.

     Clippers' Paul George out for Play-In vs. Pelicans due to health and safety protocols
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Clippers star Paul George will not play in Friday's Play-In game against the New Orleans Pelicans due to health and safety protocols, the team announced.
Friday's game will determine the No.
George was not feeling well on Thursday and the Clippers learned of his diagnosis on Friday morning, president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank said.
George recently returned to the Clippers lineup after missing three months because of a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow.
Either the Clippers or Pelicans will advance to play the top-seeded Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul George tested positive for coronavirus, according to Clippers executive Lawrence Frank.
The NBA reduced testing for asymptomatic vaccinated players.
Fully vaccinated people are less likely to contract coronavirus and, if they do have a breakthrough case, less likely to suffer severe outcomes.
The Clippers were fully vaccinated as of September, according to coach Tyronn Lue, though it’s unclear whether George received a booster.
NBA players are young, generally healthy and heavily vaccinated – i.e., less likely to suffer severe effects from coronavirus.

     Clippers' Paul George tests positive for COVID-19, out for Friday's play-in game vs. Pelicans, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Clippers will be without star Paul George for their play-in game against the New Orleans Pelicans Friday night as he's entered the league's health and safety protocols after testing positive for COVID-19, per ESPN.
This is obviously a significant blow to a Clippers team with a shot at making the playoffs on the line against the Pelicans.
George put up 34 points in L.A.'s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in its first play-in game on Tuesday, so losing him is incredibly detrimental to the Clippers playoff chances.
During that time, head coach Tye Lue elevated guard Terance Mann to the starting lineup in place of the injured George, which we could see happen again.
It'll be tough, especially against a Pelicans team where CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram just combined for 59 points against the Spurs, but it's not impossible.
