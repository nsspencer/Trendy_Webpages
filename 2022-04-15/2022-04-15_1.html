Both Robinson and Sukeforth are smiling, but on either side of them are glum-faced Dodgers players and coaches.
Jackie Robinson is congratulated by former Sen. James Mead, D-N.Y., left, and Brooklyn Borough President John Cashmore before the season opener at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, N.Y., on April 15, 1947.
If fans “expected any miracles out of Robinson, they were sadly disappointed.”Jackie Robinson during the season opener at Ebbets Field on April 15, 1947.

     This Jackie Robinson Day, let’s celebrate Rachel Robinson, too
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Friday marks the 75th anniversary of Hall of Famer Jackie Robinson integrating modern Major League Baseball.
Rachel Robinson, however, has always been more than just Jackie Robinson’s wife.
Despite her nursing degree, Rachel Robinson stayed home with the family’s three children — Jackie Jr., Sharon and David — born in 1946, 1950 and 1952, respectively.
The foundation is also set to open the Jackie Robinson Museum in New York City this spring.
Rather than just understanding Rachel as the woman who stood alongside Jackie quietly supporting him, at times, it’s worth remembering Jackie, too, as the man beside the pathbreaking Rachel Robinson.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jackie Robinson wanted equality to mean an open door for anyone to play baseball -- or to do anything else.
Doug GlanvilleLIKE MY KIDS, I was introduced to Jackie Robinson's story when I was growing up in New Jersey.
For my preparation to call the game between Stanford and UCLA on Jackie Robinson Day today, I interviewed two sons of my former teammate, Eric Karros.
In that moment, for my daughter, Jackie Robinson went from history to family.
Once you feel like Jackie Robinson, you will always be Jackie Robinson.

     Off The Field, Jackie Robinson Left A Legacy Of Black Entrepreneurship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the 1950s and 60s, it wasn’t uncommon for David Robinson to tag along with his father, baseball legend Jackie Robinson, to the Apollo Theater in New York.
Jackie Robinson also co-founded Freedom National Bank, a few doors down from the Apollo.
Off the field, he was a prominent business leader who championed Black economic advancement and entrepreneurship.
In 1951, he developed the Jackie Robinson Garden Apartments in Brooklyn, according to his foundation, and, in 1952, opened the Harlem-based Jackie Robinson Store, which sold men’s apparel.
David Robinson said he’s proud that the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which his mother Rachel Robinson started in 1972, has developed more than 1,800 young leaders.

     The True Legacy of Jackie Robinson’s Dodgers Debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Opening Day of the ’47 Negro Leagues season, Newark set an attendance record of 12,552 fans.
It was the worst-case scenario for Black baseball and a sure loss for the community at large—even as they celebrated the win of Robinson’s debut, even if the total fallout was yet unknown.
In 1939, Wendell Smith of The Pittsburgh Courier began publishing the results of his informal poll of MLB players, coaches and managers.
Already, the Negro Leagues owners had been accused of caring more about their personal profits than the progress of their people.
Rickey grabbed one Black player after another, all the while castigating Black baseball in the press.
