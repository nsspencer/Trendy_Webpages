     Summary: From TRUE: The Four Seasons of Jackie Robinson, by Kostya Kennedy.
Jackie Robinson was coming up to face the Yankees’ Bob Turley for the fifth time in the game.
In his final season with the Dodgers, Robinson helped the team to a 93–61 record—and won his sixth pennant in 10 years.
There was a time in many of these people’s lives when Jackie Robinson carried the brightest light of hope.
My own success in baseball has been in large measure because Jackie Robinson marked the trail well.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “He paved the way not only for Black baseball players and other sports professionals, but for Black leaders, Black mayors, Black business owners and Black entrepreneurs.
“Jackie Robinson was a business pioneer right here in New York.
42 on Jackie Robinson Day was initiated by Griffey, who called Selig in 2007 and asked if he could wear the number as baseball celebrated the 60th anniversary of Robinson’s debut.
“I \\[had\\] the privilege of meeting Jackie about a year and a half before he passed.
And our society right now should embrace that and follow the example that Jackie gave us to follow.”Pankey and her family have made that their central aim with the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which Rachel established in 1973 to keep her late husband’s memory alive.
