     The Jackie Robinson narrative is at odds with the reality
    </h2>

I cannot salute the flag; I know that I am a black man in a white world.

Doug GlanvilleLIKE MY KIDS, I was introduced to Jackie Robinson's story when I was growing up in New Jersey.
For my preparation to call the game between Stanford and UCLA on Jackie Robinson Day today, I interviewed two sons of my former teammate, Eric Karros.
In that moment, for my daughter, Jackie Robinson went from history to family.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the 1950s and 60s, it wasn’t uncommon for David Robinson to tag along with his father, baseball legend Jackie Robinson, to the Apollo Theater in New York.
Jackie Robinson also co-founded Freedom National Bank, a few doors down from the Apollo.
Off the field, he was a prominent business leader who championed Black economic advancement and entrepreneurship.
In 1951, he developed the Jackie Robinson Garden Apartments in Brooklyn, according to his foundation, and, in 1952, opened the Harlem-based Jackie Robinson Store, which sold men’s apparel.
David Robinson said he’s proud that the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which his mother Rachel Robinson started in 1972, has developed more than 1,800 young leaders.
