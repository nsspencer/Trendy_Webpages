     Indianapolis Colts signing CB Stephon Gilmore to two-year, $23M contract, source says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Indianapolis Colts are giving cornerback Stephon Gilmore a two-year, $23 million contract that includes $14 million guaranteed, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Gilmore becomes the second veteran addition to the Colts' secondary this week, after Indianapolis signed safety Rodney McLeod on Thursday.
Indianapolis' defense now features the five-time Pro Bowler Gilmore, Ngakoue and DeForest Buckner on the line, linebacker Darius Leonard, and one of the league's best slot corners in Kenny Moore.
Gilmore played the 2021 season with the Carolina Panthers, who traded a 2023 third-round pick to the New England Patriots in October to get him.
The 10th overall pick in the 2012 draft by the Bills, Gilmore has 27 interceptions and 116 passes defended in 10 seasons.

     Colts get CB Stephon Gilmore in most aggressive move of offseason
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Colts were busy addressing the two needs Ballard identified as critical early this offseason through a trio of blockbuster trades.
Ballard had to give up a piece he liked to address the team’s biggest need on the defensive side of the ball.
The Colts also signed long-time Patriots special teamer Brandon King, filling a spot left open by the departure of Matthew Adams to Chicago.
By adding Ryan, Ngakoue and Gilmore, the Colts have made a trio of moves that eerily mirror the 2020 offseason that produced Philip Rivers, DeForest Buckner and Xavier Rhodes.
There are other spots we have to actively improve upon between now and September.”The Gilmore signing shows the Colts are still hard at work on those spots.

     Colts signing Pro Bowl CB Stephon Gilmore to two-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network's Tom Pelissero and Ian Rapoport reported Friday the Colts are signing corner Stephon Gilmore to a two-year contract, per sources informed of the situation.
Gilmore is a five-time Pro Bowler and a sticky cover man when healthy.
After five seasons in Buffalo, Gilmore signed a big-money contract in New England in 2017, where he was the centerpiece of Bill Belichick's secondary.
In 2020-2021, Gilmore allowed a 65.6 completion percentage, four TDs, three INTs, and a 91.2 passer rating.
The Colts allowed 32 pass TDs (2nd-most in NFL) and 234.1 pass YPG (19th in NFL) in 2021.

     Film Room: What Does Stephon Gilmore Bring to the Colts?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In today's film piece, I go into detail on how this star corner can still be a difference maker for this Colts' team.
He reads the slant route quickly in his drop and explodes downhill to get in front of his man.
Gilmore quickly shifts inside to match Brown.
Once the ball is snapped, Brown quickly shoots to the outside, attempting to rub the outside cornerback off of the corner route.
Overall, this is a great signing to sure up a major weakness on the Colts' team.
