     Summary: Paul George has entered the NBA’s Health and Safety Protocols and will miss the LA Clippers’ Play-In game against New Orleans on Friday night (10 ET, TNT) at Crypto.com Arena.
Frank said George wasn’t feeling well Thursday and the team learned of his diagnosis Friday morning.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: George has tested positive for COVID-19, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic (Twitter link).
If L.A. pulls out a victory tonight, George should be able to return by Game 3 of a first-round series vs. the Suns.
George’s positive COVID-19 test could also be bad news for the Trail Blazers.
Portland will receive the Pelicans’ top-four protected 2022 first-round pick if it falls between No.
In that scenario, the Blazers would instead receive Milwaukee’s 2025 first-round pick (top-four protected).

     Clippers' Paul George tests positive for COVID-19, out for Friday's play-in game vs. Pelicans, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Clippers will be without star Paul George for their play-in game against the New Orleans Pelicans Friday night as he's entered the league's health and safety protocols after testing positive for COVID-19, per ESPN.
This is obviously a significant blow to a Clippers team with a shot at making the playoffs on the line against the Pelicans.
George put up 34 points in L.A.'s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in its first play-in game on Tuesday, so losing him is incredibly detrimental to the Clippers playoff chances.
During that time, head coach Tye Lue elevated guard Terance Mann to the starting lineup in place of the injured George, which we could see happen again.
It'll be tough, especially against a Pelicans team where CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram just combined for 59 points against the Spurs, but it's not impossible.

     Summary: One NBA scout, who spoke on condition of anonymity since he’s not authorized to speak publicly, broke down what George’s absence will mean.
[Teammates] get caught watching them do their thing whereas without Paul the ball is really moving.
… Brandon Ingram is a handful, the Pelicans have two guys who can get points in Ingram and C.J.
… New Orleans is coming along, they looked really good” in their play-in win against San Antonio.
They support each other and they play for each other.”After Tuesday’s play-in loss at Minnesota, Powell said he would need to be more aggressive on offense Friday, a sentiment that takes on even more importance with George’s absence.
