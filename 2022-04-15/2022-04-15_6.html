     Cavaliers All-Star center Jarrett Allen returns for elimination Play-In game vs. Hawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cleveland Cavaliers center Jarrett Allen returned and started in Friday’s Play-In game against the Atlanta Hawks (LIVE, ESPN).
On Thursday, Allen was upgraded to questionable, then went through pre-game warmups before it was officially announced he would play roughly 30 minutes before game time.
It’s a must-win game for the Cavaliers, who missed their first opportunity to clinch a playoff spot after losing to the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday.
The loser between Cleveland and Atlanta is eliminated, while the winner will clinch the No.
Allen was in the midst of a breakout season prior to his injury, fueling Cleveland on both ends of the floor.

     Pacers Backing Cavs in Friday's Play-In Game. Here's Why
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First, it's the Atlanta Hawks at the Cleveland Cavaliers, then the Los Angeles Clippers hosting the New Orleans Pelicans.
And while the Pacers aren't even in the playoff conversation following a 25-57 season, fans should root to see a Cavs win.
If the pick does not convey to the Pacers this season, they would then be due a lottery-protected 1st from the Cavs in 2023.
So while the Pacers' season ended concluded on Sunday, there will be supreme interest on Hawks-Cavs Friday at 7:30 p.m.
