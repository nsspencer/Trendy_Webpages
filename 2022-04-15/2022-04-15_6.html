     Sienna Miller Found Catharsis in ‘Anatomy of a Scandal’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “There’s catharsis in all of it,” Miller said.
“Anytime you get to go to work and cry, it sort of feels weirdly good.”Watching Miller in the role, Vaughan noted the rawness of her performance, the seeming honesty of it.
“I don’t know if I’m reading into that because of knowing what she’s experienced,” Vaughan said.
“She deserves every challenge,” Gibson said, “because she’s up to it.”These days, Miller has more self-esteem.
She tells her adversary, “A lot of people think they know me.

     'Anatomy of a Scandal' review: Michelle Dockery and Sienna Miller star in a twisty courtroom mystery around privilege and politics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —An old-fashioned courtroom miniseries with a somewhat more modern backdrop of sexual politics, “Anatomy of a Scandal” is a crisply told, nicely binge-able mystery that doesn’t overstay its welcome.
As mentioned, there’s a throwback quality to all of that, and even the title evokes thoughts of something like the Otto Preminger courtroom mystery “Anatomy of a Murder” back in 1959.
Yet all told, “Anatomy of a Scandal” overcomes its flaws well enough to lay the groundwork for what’s intended to become an ongoing franchise of tightly constructed self-contained thrillers.
The trick, as this first lesson in “Anatomy” demonstrates, is coming up with the right wrinkles to flesh them out.
“Anatomy of a Scandal” premieres April 15 on Netflix.

     ‘Anatomy of a Scandal’ Feels Real About Power and Politics Despite Soap Opera Cheesiness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Those real-life events give Netflix’s Anatomy of a Scandal, a limited series about a philandering MP charged with rape, the feeling of plausibility.
But Anatomy of a Scandal, created by David E. Kelley and Melissa James Gibson, is presented with far more dramatic flair than any real-world scandal.
The accusation and resulting trial sends his wife, Sophie, embodied with grace by Sienna Miller, into a tailspin.
Much like The Undoing, Anatomy of a Scandal relies on courtroom scenes and stylized flashbacks to tell its tale.
Anatomy of a Scandal is compelling, even in its shortcomings.

     ‘Yummy mummies with predatory husbands’ took over TV. Blame David E. Kelley
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Television editor Matt Brennan and staff writer Meredith Blake hash it out:Matt Brennan: Honestly, the first episode of “Anatomy of a Scandal” wasn’t terrible.
Because even as I found myself exasperated with the series early and often, I devoured “Anatomy of a Scandal” anyway.
Yet I am still drawn to them, episode after episode, almost exactly five years after “Big Little Lies” took television by storm.
All of which is to say, yes, Kelley (and Gibson) certainly know how to keep us hooked.
In a way, it’s reassuring because it has no ambition or interest beyond getting us from point to point.
