     Clippers' Paul George (Health and Safety Protocols) out vs. Pelicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul George has entered the NBA’s Health and Safety Protocols and will miss the Los Angeles Clippers’ play-in game against New Orleans on Friday night (10 ET, TNT) at Crypto.com Arena.
The winner of that game — in which the eighth-seeded Clippers are hosting the ninth-seeded Pelicans — will earn the No.
In the Clippers’ Play-In Tournament opener on Tuesday against Minnesota, George finished with a team-high 34 points (10-24 FG) as well as seven rebounds and five assists in a 109-104 loss.
Overall this season, George is averaging 24.3 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 5.7 apg and 2.2 spg.
Besides George, the Clippers were already without Kawhi Leonard, who hasn’t played all season while rehabbing from an ACL tear.

     Paul George Tests Positive For COVID, Will Miss Play-In Game vs. Pelicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Less than 24 hours before the biggest game of the Los Angeles Clippers season, superstar Paul George has tested positive for COVID-19, according to sources.
Clippers star Paul George has entered health and safety protocols and will miss tonight's Play-in game vs. New Orleans, sources tell @TimBontemps and me.
The game also has a lot on the line for the Portland Trail Blazers, as former Blazers Norman Powell, Robert Covington and CJ McCollum among others will participate in tonight’s game.
During Tuesday’s first play-in game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, George scored a game-high 34 points.
With a lot riding on tonight’s game, this news couldn’t have come at a worst time for Clippers - and Blazers - fans.

     Paul George enters protocols, will miss Clippers play-in game Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clippers star Paul George will miss Friday night’s play-in tournament game vs. the Pelicans due to entering COVID-19 health and safety protocols, per ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski and Tim Bontemps.
It is unclear when George will be available again, if the Clippers advance into the playoffs.
George played in Tuesday night’s play-in tournament game vs. the Timberwolves, which the Clippers lost 109–104.
Now, the Clippers will be without their star in their most crucial game of the season.
George has averaged 24.3 points, 6.9 rebounds and 5.7 assists in an average of 34.7 minutes per game.

     Clippers’ Paul George will miss tonight’s play-in game against New Orleans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clippers star Paul George has entered the NBA’s health and safety protocols and will miss Friday’s game against New Orleans to decide the Western Conference’s eighth and final playoff spot.
George scored a game-high 34 points in the Clippers’ loss Tuesday to Minnesota in the first game of the play-in tournament, a result that left the Clippers needing to beat New Orleans at Crypto.com Arena to advance to a first-round series against top-seeded Phoenix.
It’s still not known if the Clippers will be without reserve guard Luke Kennard, whose 44.9% three-point accuracy led the NBA.
“This has been our season,” Frank told reporters.
They support each other and they play for each other.”After Tuesday’s play-in loss at Minnesota, Powell said he would need to be more aggressive on offense Friday, a sentiment that takes on even more importance with George’s absence.

     Paul George Out Friday Due To Positive COVID-19 Test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: George has tested positive for COVID-19, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic (Twitter link).
If L.A. pulls out a victory tonight, George should be able to return by Game 3 of a first-round series vs. the Suns.
George’s positive COVID-19 test could also be bad news for the Trail Blazers.
Portland will receive the Pelicans’ top-four protected 2022 first-round pick if it falls between No.
In that scenario, the Blazers would instead receive Milwaukee’s 2025 first-round pick (top-four protected).

     Clippers' Paul George tests positive for COVID-19, out for Friday's play-in game vs. Pelicans, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Clippers will be without star Paul George for their play-in game against the New Orleans Pelicans Friday night as he's entered the league's health and safety protocols after testing positive for COVID-19, per ESPN.
This is obviously a significant blow to a Clippers team with a shot at making the playoffs on the line against the Pelicans.
George put up 34 points in L.A.'s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in its first play-in game on Tuesday, so losing him is incredibly detrimental to the Clippers playoff chances.
During that time, head coach Tye Lue elevated guard Terance Mann to the starting lineup in place of the injured George, which we could see happen again.
It'll be tough, especially against a Pelicans team where CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram just combined for 59 points against the Spurs, but it's not impossible.
