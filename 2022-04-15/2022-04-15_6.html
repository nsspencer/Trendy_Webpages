    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clippers star Paul George will miss Friday night’s play-in tournament game vs. the Pelicans due to entering COVID-19 health and safety protocols, per ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski and Tim Bontemps.
It is unclear when George will be available again, if the Clippers advance into the playoffs.

     Clippers' Paul George (Health and Safety Protocols) out vs. Pelicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul George has entered the NBA’s Health and Safety Protocols and will miss the Los Angeles Clippers’ play-in game against New Orleans on Friday night (10 ET, TNT) at Crypto.com Arena.
The winner of that game — in which the eighth-seeded Clippers are hosting the ninth-seeded Pelicans — will earn the No.
In the Clippers’ Play-In Tournament opener on Tuesday against Minnesota, George finished with a team-high 34 points (10-24 FG) as well as seven rebounds and five assists in a 109-104 loss.
Overall this season, George is averaging 24.3 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 5.7 apg and 2.2 spg.
Besides George, the Clippers were already without Kawhi Leonard, who hasn’t played all season while rehabbing from an ACL tear.

     Paul George to miss Clippers-Pelicans play-in game (coronavirus)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul George tested positive for coronavirus, according to Clippers executive Lawrence Frank.
The NBA reduced testing for asymptomatic vaccinated players.
Fully vaccinated people are less likely to contract coronavirus and, if they do have a breakthrough case, less likely to suffer severe outcomes.
The Clippers were fully vaccinated as of September, according to coach Tyronn Lue, though it’s unclear whether George received a booster.
NBA players are young, generally healthy and heavily vaccinated – i.e., less likely to suffer severe effects from coronavirus.

     Paul George Out Friday Due To Positive COVID-19 Test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: George has tested positive for COVID-19, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic (Twitter link).
If L.A. pulls out a victory tonight, George should be able to return by Game 3 of a first-round series vs. the Suns.
George’s positive COVID-19 test could also be bad news for the Trail Blazers.
Portland will receive the Pelicans’ top-four protected 2022 first-round pick if it falls between No.
In that scenario, the Blazers would instead receive Milwaukee’s 2025 first-round pick (top-four protected).

     Scouts take: How Paul George’s COVID-19 case impacts play-in game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One NBA scout, who spoke on condition of anonymity since he’s not authorized to speak publicly, broke down what George’s absence will mean.
[Teammates] get caught watching them do their thing whereas without Paul the ball is really moving.
… Brandon Ingram is a handful, the Pelicans have two guys who can get points in Ingram and C.J.
… New Orleans is coming along, they looked really good” in their play-in win against San Antonio.
They support each other and they play for each other.”After Tuesday’s play-in loss at Minnesota, Powell said he would need to be more aggressive on offense Friday, a sentiment that takes on even more importance with George’s absence.
