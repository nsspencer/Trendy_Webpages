     Mike Bossy, Hall of Famer on Champion Islander Teams, Dies at 65
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike Bossy, the Hockey Hall of Fame wing who played a key role in propelling the New York Islanders to four consecutive Stanley Cup championships in the early 1980s, has died.
The Islanders announced his death but gave no other details.

     Summary: Mike Bossy, NHL Hall of Famer, one of the most prolific and electric scorers in league history and the Islanders’ all time leading goal-scorer, has passed away at 65, the team announced this morning.
With burly Clark Gillies on the left side, the Bossy-Trottier chemistry propelled the team to heights no US-based NHL team has seen in 40 years.
22 retired the same year by the Islanders, the only NHL team he ever played for.
Beyond the team’s disappointing place in the standings, we’ve had to reckon with the losses of Clark Gillies, Jean Potvin and now Mike Bossy.
