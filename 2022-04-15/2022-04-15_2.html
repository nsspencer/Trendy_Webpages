     Mike Bossy, a Stanley Cup Hero, Was More Appreciated Than He Knew
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oh, my goodness: Mike Bossy, after his magnificent hockey career was over, came to feel the New York Islanders were underappreciated.
Bossy, who died Friday at 65, was the indispensable artiste — as they say in his native Quebec — of the greatest team I ever covered: so many superb players and mentalities who came through, game after game.
In one unforgettable Stanley Cup final round in 1982, I witnessed Bossy poaching a game-winning overtime goal in the first game, and in the third game, in Vancouver, he was sent flying by his antagonist, Tiger Williams, only to sling a goal while in midair.
Yet Bossy once told Sports Illustrated that he felt the Islanders were not appreciated.
Just because the Islanders played in a drab barn in the flat Long Island suburbs?
