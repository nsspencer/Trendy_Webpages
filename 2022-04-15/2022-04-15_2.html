     Pacers Backing Cavs in Friday's Play-In Game. Here's Why
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First, it's the Atlanta Hawks at the Cleveland Cavaliers, then the Los Angeles Clippers hosting the New Orleans Pelicans.
And while the Pacers aren't even in the playoff conversation following a 25-57 season, fans should root to see a Cavs win.
