    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Being named after Jackie Robinson makes us feel a little more special than the normal Boys &amp; Girls Club,” Francis said.
We want to make sure we’re instilling the character that Jackie Robinson stood for.”What was that?
In a most fitting gesture, the Atlanta Braves brought their World Series championship trophy to Robinson's birthplace on Jackie Robinson Day.
Bring a real big league game to the town where it all started.
If a fictional movie is worthy of a special game, Jackie Robinson most certainly is, too.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jackie Robinson wanted equality to mean an open door for anyone to play baseball -- or to do anything else.
Doug GlanvilleLIKE MY KIDS, I was introduced to Jackie Robinson's story when I was growing up in New Jersey.
For my preparation to call the game between Stanford and UCLA on Jackie Robinson Day today, I interviewed two sons of my former teammate, Eric Karros.
In that moment, for my daughter, Jackie Robinson went from history to family.
Once you feel like Jackie Robinson, you will always be Jackie Robinson.

     The Long Autumn of Jackie Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From TRUE: The Four Seasons of Jackie Robinson, by Kostya Kennedy.
Jackie Robinson was coming up to face the Yankees’ Bob Turley for the fifth time in the game.
In his final season with the Dodgers, Robinson helped the team to a 93–61 record—and won his sixth pennant in 10 years.
There was a time in many of these people’s lives when Jackie Robinson carried the brightest light of hope.
My own success in baseball has been in large measure because Jackie Robinson marked the trail well.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “He paved the way not only for Black baseball players and other sports professionals, but for Black leaders, Black mayors, Black business owners and Black entrepreneurs.
“Jackie Robinson was a business pioneer right here in New York.
42 on Jackie Robinson Day was initiated by Griffey, who called Selig in 2007 and asked if he could wear the number as baseball celebrated the then-60th anniversary of Robinson’s debut.
“I \\[had\\] the privilege of meeting Jackie about a year and a half before he passed.
And our society right now should embrace that and follow the example that Jackie gave us to follow.”Pankey and her family have made that their central aim with the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which Rachel established in 1973 to keep her late husband’s memory alive.
