     Summary: “[Selig] called me back the next day and said, ‘I talked to Rachel, and she said, can everyone wear it?’ I said, ‘The more, the merrier,’” Griffey, now a senior advisor to Commissioner Manfred, explained Friday.
“I wanted to wear it to honor that man because of the sacrifices that he had and what he did.
If it wasn’t for him, maybe my dad would have never played.
Maybe I would have never played.
He did it for each and every one of us to allow us to go out there and play the game that we love.”

     On Jackie Robinson Day, remember Hilton Smith, who helped make Robinson possible
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is no mention of Jackie Robinson on Hilton Lee Smith's plaque at the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Young writes that Smith talked Robinson out of quitting during his time in Kansas City, telling the rookie, "Jackie, you have a future."
His curveball is considered one of the most wicked pitches in Negro Leagues history.
(Negro Leagues stats are an official part of MLB record books, yet the numbers are incomplete.)
As Robinson made history, Smith entered his 40s and his baseball career wound down after the 1948 season with the Monarchs.

     Jackie Robinson died unhappy with baseball
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Robinson is one of the few Black historical figures who was regularly taught to children my age in the 1990s.
The Los Angeles Times’ Ron Rapoport had a piece published yesterday titled, Baseball Reveres Jackie Robinson, but Robinson didn’t Revere Baseball.
I am glad I haven’t had to go to baseball on my knees.”Robinson was a fiercely proud Black man.
But if Ronald Regan met Dr. King in 1968 while he was governor of California, he probably would not have even wanted to exchange Christmas cards.
What both Dr. King and Robinson clearly understood was that correcting racism involved more than simply changing some laws and taking down some signs.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jackie Robinson wanted equality to mean an open door for anyone to play baseball -- or to do anything else.
Doug GlanvilleLIKE MY KIDS, I was introduced to Jackie Robinson's story when I was growing up in New Jersey.
For my preparation to call the game between Stanford and UCLA on Jackie Robinson Day today, I interviewed two sons of my former teammate, Eric Karros.
In that moment, for my daughter, Jackie Robinson went from history to family.
Once you feel like Jackie Robinson, you will always be Jackie Robinson.

     The Long Autumn of Jackie Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From TRUE: The Four Seasons of Jackie Robinson, by Kostya Kennedy.
Jackie Robinson was coming up to face the Yankees’ Bob Turley for the fifth time in the game.
In his final season with the Dodgers, Robinson helped the team to a 93–61 record—and won his sixth pennant in 10 years.
There was a time in many of these people’s lives when Jackie Robinson carried the brightest light of hope.
My own success in baseball has been in large measure because Jackie Robinson marked the trail well.
