     Summary: How Jackie Robinson inspired one man 'to be somebody'(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LEILA FADEL, HOST:For today's StoryCorps, we look back on April 15, 1947, 75 years ago today, when Jackie Robinson became the first Black player in Major League Baseball.
HAROLD LUCAS JR: Well, baseball was one of the few things that you didn't have to have a whole lot of equipment for.
BUTTS-LUCAS: What did you expect to see when you saw Jackie Robinson play that first game?
You know, even though you might not like somebody, if they can play baseball that well, then you'll cheer for them.
BUTTS-LUCAS: When Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier, did you feel more hopeful for Black Americans?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‚ÄúBeing named after Jackie Robinson makes us feel a little more special than the normal Boys &amp; Girls Club,‚Äù Francis said.
We want to make sure we‚Äôre instilling the character that Jackie Robinson stood for.‚ÄùWhat was that?
In a most fitting gesture, the Atlanta Braves brought their World Series championship trophy to Robinson's birthplace on Jackie Robinson Day.
Bring a real big league game to the town where it all started.
If a fictional movie is worthy of a special game, Jackie Robinson most certainly is, too.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the 1950s and 60s, it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for David Robinson to tag along with his father, baseball legend Jackie Robinson, to the Apollo Theater in New York.

     The Long Autumn of Jackie Robinson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From TRUE: The Four Seasons of Jackie Robinson, by Kostya Kennedy.
Jackie Robinson was coming up to face the Yankees‚Äô Bob Turley for the fifth time in the game.
In his final season with the Dodgers, Robinson helped the team to a 93‚Äì61 record‚Äîand won his sixth pennant in 10 years.
There was a time in many of these people‚Äôs lives when Jackie Robinson carried the brightest light of hope.
My own success in baseball has been in large measure because Jackie Robinson marked the trail well.
