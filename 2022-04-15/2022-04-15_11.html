     Could the Vikings trade for Kyler Murray before the 2022 season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 7 greatest quarterbacks who were drafted by the Minnesota Vikings by Adam PatrickAs trade rumors appear to be picking up again for Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, what are the chances that he would land with the Minnesota Vikings?
During a Week 2 loss to the Arizona Cardinals last season, the Minnesota Vikings had the opportunity to witness how special of a player Kyler Murray is.
Murray led the Cardinals to a victory over the Vikings in 2021 by throwing for 400 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.
In order to acquire Murray, Minnesota would have to figure out what to do with Kirk Cousins.
But if a trade involving Murray were to happen this offseason, it would likely go down before or during the upcoming 2022 NFL Draft.

     Kyler Murray Trade to Texans? Houston 'Would Explore,' Insists NFL Insider
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyler Murray trade gossip - and that is where your Houston Texans come in.
The Houston Texans just extricated themselves from a mess with an unhappy star QB.
Are they really interested in doing it all again - from the other side of the trade table?
The drama surrounding the Arizona Cardinals and star quarterback Kyler Murray continues on this offseason, with the club - despite insisting that it is completely committed to the former No.
That piece of actual news (from NFL Network insider Tom Pelissero) has spawned the expected "inside info'' ... or, maybe, just gossip.

     Falcons named as logical landing spot for QB Kyler Murray
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Over The Cap’s projections, the Falcons have around $3.3 in cap space, and Murray is set to make $11.3 million this season with $5.2 million guaranteed.
1 overall pick doesn’t want to be in Arizona.
The Falcons will actually have money next season, though, so a trade followed by an extension is still possible.
Then if you consider the draft capital the team would have to give up, it would make it hard to add talent around Murray.
Despite all of that, the Falcons would be crazy not to pursue Murray if he becomes available.
