     South Carolina Prisoner Chooses to Be Executed by Firing Squad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A spokeswoman for the prison agency said prisoners who chose the firing squad would be strapped to a chair and a hood would be placed on them.
“I believe the firing squad is much more instantaneous, much less painful,” Mr. Harpootlian said.
“I don’t think he fits the ‘worst of the worst’ category,” Mr. Harpootlian said.
Mr. Moore, who was shot in the arm during the altercation, fled after grabbing a bag of money totaling about $1,400.
A jury convicted Mr. Moore in 2001 and recommended that he be executed.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: COLUMBIA, S.C. (WIS) - Richard Moore chose death by firing squad Friday as his execution date approaches.
Moore, a death row inmate, was given the choice by the South Carolina Department of Corrections between that and the electric chair.
This will be the first firing squad execution in the state since lawmakers passed legislation in 2021 on executions.
Moore’s legal team said only 3 executions by firing squad have taken place in the United States since 1973.
The Director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections, Bryan Stirling issued an affidavit on the case.

     South Carolina death row prisoner chooses firing squad over electric chair
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A South Carolina prisoner scheduled to be the first man executed in the state in more than a decade has decided to die by firing squad rather than in the electric chair later this month, according to court documents filed on Friday.
Moore’s attorneys have asked the state supreme court to delay his death while another court determines if either available method is cruel and unusual punishment.
His lawyers are also asking the state supreme court to delay the execution so the US supreme court can review whether Moore’s death sentence was a disproportionate punishment compared with similar crimes.
In the case of a firing squad execution, three volunteer prison workers will train their rifles on the condemned prisoner’s heart.
South Carolina is one of eight states to still use the electric chair and one of four to allow a firing squad, according to the Washington-based non-profit Death Penalty Information Center.

     South Carolina death row inmate chooses to be executed by firing squad over the electric chair
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —A man sentenced to death in South Carolina has chosen to be executed by firing squad rather than the electric chair, which would make him the first death row inmate to die by firing squad in the state.
He did not have the option of choosing lethal injection, as South Carolina does not have the necessary drugs, according to the filing.
South Carolina is one of four states, including Oklahoma, Mississippi and Utah, allowing executions by firing squad.
After a small “aim point” is placed over the person’s heart, the firing squad – which will not be visible to witnesses – will fire.
SCDC says the firing squad members will be volunteer SCDC employees who “must meet certain qualifications.”

     S. Carolina Prisoner Chooses Firing Squad Over Electric Chair As He Challenges Law That Forces Death Row Inmates To Pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineA South Carolina death row prisoner chose Friday to die by firing squad instead of an electric chair, after he was required by a new law to pick or the state would choose for him—but he questioned the constitutionality of either punishment.
Moore has been on death row for two decades after he was convicted of murder in 2001 for killing a convenience store clerk during an attempted robbery—though Moore claims he acted in self-defense.
The South Carolina Department of Corrections said last month it completed $53,400 worth of renovations to the death chamber in the state’s capital to restart executions.
