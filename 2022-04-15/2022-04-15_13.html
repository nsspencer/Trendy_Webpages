     Twins' Byron Buxton: Leaves with injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Buxton exited Friday's game against the Red Sox with an apparent injury, Dan Hayes of The Athletic reports.
The 28-year-old led off the game with a shallow pop fly that the Red Sox mishandled, and he appeared to injure himself while sliding into second base with a double.
He walked off the field under his own power and the specifics of the issue remain unclear, but any injury is a significant development for Buxton given his problems staying healthy throughout his career.

     Minnesota Twins awaiting MRI results on Byron Buxton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Byron Buxton leads off the game with a double, but quickly heads to the dugout after hurting himself on his slide into second base.
(0:38)Outfielder Byron Buxton is getting an MRI on his right knee after leaving in the first inning of Friday's game against the Red Sox in Boston, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.
Buxton was hurt on a last-second slide into second base after the Red Sox had misplayed his pop fly to shallow left field to lead off the game.
Speaking after Minnesota's 8-4 win, Baldelli said he'd hold off on making any roster moves until the results of the MRI came back to the team.
Buxton signed a seven-year, $100 million extension with Minnesota in November, despite a checkered injury past.

     Summary: Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton left Friday's game after sliding into second base in the first inning.
Buxton, who signed an incentive-laden $100 million extension in November, has a lengthy injury history.
Buxton has played more than 92 MLB games in a season just once, when he played 140 in 2017.
In 61 games last season Buxton amassed 4.5 WAR, the most produced by a player who played fewer than 70 games since 1900.
Including the first-inning double, Buxton is 6-for-24 to start this season with three home runs and three doubles.

     Summary: Twins center fielder Byron Buxton is one of the most dynamic and, frankly, best players in baseball when he's able to stay on the field.
Leading off the game in Fenway Park against the Red Sox Friday afternoon, Buxton doubled.
The Twins have since announced that it is right knee soreness for Buxton and that he'll further be evaluated.
He hit .306/.358/.647 (172 OPS+) with 23 doubles, 19 homers, 32 RBI, 50 runs, nine steals and 4.5 WAR.
So far this season, Buxton is hitting .250/.308/.750 with three doubles, three homers, four RBI, five runs and a steal in seven games.

     Byron Buxton leaves Twins' victory in Boston because of right knee soreness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — Byron Buxton appeared in his 500th game with the Twins on Friday.
Buxton was experiencing soreness in his right knee, the Twins announced, but was walking around the clubhouse during the game, a hopeful sign.
The ball fell between the fielders, and Buxton, rounding first at the time, suddenly sped up and raced to second base ahead of a throw from Verdugo.
Since staying healthy enough to appear in 140 games in 2017, Buxton has appeared in only 222 of a possible 553 games.
The Twins are trying not to let Buxton's injury deflate them just a week into the season.

     Summary: Joe Ryan throws a fastball right over the middle and Alex Verdugo reduces the Twins’ aheading.
Next reliever Phillips Valdez hits Max Kepler, the last Twins outfielder left alive, but Kepler steals a base, so he’s not broken (yet).
Ryan gets a flyout and popout to remain someone we like, so far, today.
His Dark Materials sends down the Sox without any drama whatsoever, and Twins win 8-4!
Studs of the game: Ryan, Sano for breaking out of a mini-slump, Sanchez for designatedly hitting.

     Twins star Byron Buxton is already hurt again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As we progress deeper into his career, the realization that Byron Buxton will never play a full 162 games in an MLB season is surely setting upon Minnesota Twins fans.
Just seven games into the 2022 regular season, Buxton went down with an ankle injury after hitting a leadoff double in the first inning against the Boston Red Sox.
A player with untapped potential, Buxton has featured in more than 100 games in a single season just one time, back in 2017.
In a tale as old as time, Twins fans entered the 2022 season hoping Buxton’s injury-proneness would be a thing of the past.
Clearly, that’s not the case, as the star centerfielder went down just seven games into the season.
