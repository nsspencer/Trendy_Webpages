     South Carolina death row inmate chooses to be executed by firing squad over the electric chair
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A man sentenced to death in South Carolina has chosen to be executed by firing squad rather than the electric chair, which would make him the first death row inmate to die by firing squad in the state.
Richard Bernard Moore, 57, would also be the first person executed in South Carolina in more than a decade, as the state has struggled to procure the drugs required to perform lethal injection.
Moore, who was sentenced to death for the 1999 murder of a convenience store clerk, is set to be executed on April 29.
In a court filing Friday, Moore chose to die by firing squad but added in a statement he will not lose hope in two pending court challenges to the constitutionality of the state's death penalty methods.
"I believe this election is forcing me to choose between two unconstitutional methods of execution, and I do not intend to waive any challenges to electrocution or firing squad by making an election," he said in the statement.

     South Carolina Prisoner Chooses to Be Executed by Firing Squad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A spokeswoman for the prison agency said prisoners who chose the firing squad would be strapped to a chair and a hood would be placed on them.
“I believe the firing squad is much more instantaneous, much less painful,” Mr. Harpootlian said.
“I don’t think he fits the ‘worst of the worst’ category,” Mr. Harpootlian said.
Mr. Moore, who was shot in the arm during the altercation, fled after grabbing a bag of money totaling about $1,400.
A jury convicted Mr. Moore in 2001 and recommended that he be executed.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A South Carolina prisoner scheduled to be the first man executed in the state in more than a decade has decided to die by firing squad rather than in the electric chair later this month, according to court documents filed on Friday.
Moore’s attorneys have asked the state supreme court to delay his death while another court determines if either available method is cruel and unusual punishment.
His lawyers are also asking the state supreme court to delay the execution so the US supreme court can review whether Moore’s death sentence was a disproportionate punishment compared with similar crimes.
In the case of a firing squad execution, three volunteer prison workers will train their rifles on the condemned prisoner’s heart.
South Carolina is one of eight states to still use the electric chair and one of four to allow a firing squad, according to the Washington-based non-profit Death Penalty Information Center.

     Summary: A South Carolina prisoner on death row has elected to be executed by firing squad rather than the electric chair at the end of this month, according to court documents filed Friday.
A year-old law made the electric chair the default method, but allowed inmates the option to be shot.
The prisoner has been on death row for decades following his conviction for the 1999 murder of a Spartanburg store clerk.
He would be only the fourth American to be executed by a firing squad since 1976.
Thirty-four other men are on death row in the state.

     Summary: A South Carolina prisoner scheduled for execution later this month has chosen to die by firing squad rather than in the electric chairCOLUMBIA, S.C. -- A South Carolina prisoner scheduled to be the first man executed in the state in more than a decade has decided to die by firing squad rather than in the electric chair later this month, according to court documents filed Friday.
Only three executions in the United States have been carried out by firing squad since 1976, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.
Moore’s would mark the first since Ronnie Lee Gardner ’s 2010 execution by a five-person firing squad in Utah.
South Carolina is one of eight states to still use the electric chair and one of four to allow a firing squad, according to the center.
In the case of a firing squad execution, three volunteer prison workers will train their rifles on the condemned prisoner’s heart.

     S. Carolina Prisoner Chooses Firing Squad Over Electric Chair As He Challenges Law That Forces Death Row Inmates To Pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineA South Carolina death row prisoner chose Friday to die by firing squad instead of an electric chair, after he was required by a new law to pick or the state would choose for him—but he questioned the constitutionality of either punishment.
Moore has been on death row for two decades after he was convicted of murder in 2001 for killing a convenience store clerk during an attempted robbery—though Moore claims he acted in self-defense.
The South Carolina Department of Corrections said last month it completed $53,400 worth of renovations to the death chamber in the state’s capital to restart executions.
