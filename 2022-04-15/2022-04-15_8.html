     Kyler Murray Trade to Falcons? 'Obvious Candidate,' Insists NFL Insider
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "The most obvious candidates would be the three finalists for Deshaun Watson who didn’t get the new Browns quarterback,'' says Florio.
The drama surrounding the Arizona Cardinals and star quarterback Kyler Murray continues on this offseason, with the club - despite insisting that it is completely committed to the former No.
That piece of actual news (from NFL Network insider Tom Pelissero) has spawned the expected "inside info'' ... or, maybe, just gossip.
Some facts:4) The Falcons would have some cap challenges in trying to sign Murray and then building around him.
There is no "inside info.''

     Could the Vikings trade for Kyler Murray before the 2022 season?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 7 greatest quarterbacks who were drafted by the Minnesota Vikings by Adam PatrickAs trade rumors appear to be picking up again for Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, what are the chances that he would land with the Minnesota Vikings?
During a Week 2 loss to the Arizona Cardinals last season, the Minnesota Vikings had the opportunity to witness how special of a player Kyler Murray is.
Murray led the Cardinals to a victory over the Vikings in 2021 by throwing for 400 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.
In order to acquire Murray, Minnesota would have to figure out what to do with Kirk Cousins.
But if a trade involving Murray were to happen this offseason, it would likely go down before or during the upcoming 2022 NFL Draft.

     The Cardinals aren't listening to Kyler Murray and are flirting with disaster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And Murray knows all this for a fact, even after he restored all the Cardinals photos to his Instagram page.
— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) April 14, 2022You’d think Arizona would have any coherent strategy to keep their quarterback happy.
What’s more plausible: Do the Cardinals know what they’re doing with Murray, who has only recently started showing public discontent with his team?
Perhaps Murray has blindsided the Cardinals by being proactive in asking for an early massive contract extension.
