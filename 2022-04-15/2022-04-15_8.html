     Summary: After hearing about Wheaton’s traumatic childhood, Stand By Me’s Jerry O’Connell felt the need to reach out.
The Star Trek: TNG alum has been open in recent years about the alleged emotional abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents.

While acting came naturally to him, Wil Wheaton seemingly felt his whole acting career was a little traumatic for him.
He spoke on his not-so-pleasant experience with William Shatner and dealing with a Wesley-hating tech writer on the Star Trek TNG set.
