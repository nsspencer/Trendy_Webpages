     Mike Bossy, Hall of Famer on Champion Islander Teams, Dies at 65
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mike Bossy, the Hockey Hall of Fame wing who played a key role in propelling the New York Islanders to four consecutive Stanley Cup championships in the early 1980s, died on Friday at his home in Montreal.
Kimber Auerbach, director of communications for the Islanders, said the cause was lung cancer.
Bossy announced he had the disease in October.
The Islanders, founded as a National Hockey League expansion team in 1972, won only 12 games in their first season at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island and weren’t much better the following season.
(Gillies died of cancer on Jan. 21 at 67.)
