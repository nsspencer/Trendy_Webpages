     Liz Sheridan, 'Seinfeld' actress, dead at 93
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Liz Sheridan, a veteran stage and screen actress who played Jerry Seinfeld's mother, Helen, on "Seinfeld," died Friday morning, her manager and friend Amanda Hendon confirmed to CNN.
Sheridan had celebrated her 93rd birthday earlier this week, Hendon said.
Though she had dozens of film credits, she was best known as Seinfeld's doting mother on his titular sitcom, which ran for nine seasons.
Sheridan was an author, too, penning the autobiographical "Dizzy &amp; Jimmy" about her relationship with a young, pre-stardom James Dean when the two were aspiring Broadway performers.
At the time of her death, she'd been working to develop the book into a film, Hendon said.
