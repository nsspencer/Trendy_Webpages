     Paul George enters protocols, will miss Clippers play-in game Friday

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clippers star Paul George will miss Friday night’s play-in tournament game vs. the Pelicans due to entering COVID-19 health and safety protocols, per ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski and Tim Bontemps.
It is unclear when George will be available again, if the Clippers advance into the playoffs.
George played in Tuesday night’s play-in tournament game vs. the Timberwolves, which the Clippers lost 109–104.
Now, the Clippers will be without their star in their most crucial game of the season.
George has averaged 24.3 points, 6.9 rebounds and 5.7 assists in an average of 34.7 minutes per game.

     Clippers' Paul George (Health and Safety Protocols) out vs. Pelicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paul George has entered the NBA’s Health and Safety Protocols and will miss the Los Angeles Clippers’ play-in game against New Orleans on Friday night (10 ET, TNT) at Crypto.com Arena.
The winner of that game — in which the eighth-seeded Clippers are hosting the ninth-seeded Pelicans — will earn the No.
In the Clippers’ Play-In Tournament opener on Tuesday against Minnesota, George finished with a team-high 34 points (10-24 FG) as well as seven rebounds and five assists in a 109-104 loss.
Overall this season, George is averaging 24.3 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 5.7 apg and 2.2 spg.
Besides George, the Clippers were already without Kawhi Leonard, who hasn’t played all season while rehabbing from an ACL tear.

     Paul George Out Friday Due To Positive COVID-19 Test
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: George has tested positive for COVID-19, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic (Twitter link).
If L.A. pulls out a victory tonight, George should be able to return by Game 3 of a first-round series vs. the Suns.
George’s positive COVID-19 test could also be bad news for the Trail Blazers.
Portland will receive the Pelicans’ top-four protected 2022 first-round pick if it falls between No.
In that scenario, the Blazers would instead receive Milwaukee’s 2025 first-round pick (top-four protected).

     Clippers' Paul George tests positive for COVID-19, out for Friday's play-in game vs. Pelicans, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Clippers will be without star Paul George for their play-in game against the New Orleans Pelicans Friday night as he's entered the league's health and safety protocols after testing positive for COVID-19, per ESPN.
This is obviously a significant blow to a Clippers team with a shot at making the playoffs on the line against the Pelicans.
George put up 34 points in L.A.'s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in its first play-in game on Tuesday, so losing him is incredibly detrimental to the Clippers playoff chances.
During that time, head coach Tye Lue elevated guard Terance Mann to the starting lineup in place of the injured George, which we could see happen again.
It'll be tough, especially against a Pelicans team where CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram just combined for 59 points against the Spurs, but it's not impossible.

[Teammates] get caught watching them do their thing whereas without Paul the ball is really moving.
… Brandon Ingram is a handful, the Pelicans have two guys who can get points in Ingram and C.J.
… New Orleans is coming along, they looked really good” in their play-in win against San Antonio.
They support each other and they play for each other.”After Tuesday’s play-in loss at Minnesota, Powell said he would need to be more aggressive on offense Friday, a sentiment that takes on even more importance with George’s absence.
