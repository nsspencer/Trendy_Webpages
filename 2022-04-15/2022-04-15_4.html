     Sienna Miller Found Catharsis in ‘Anatomy of a Scandal’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “There’s catharsis in all of it,” Miller said.
“Anytime you get to go to work and cry, it sort of feels weirdly good.”Watching Miller in the role, Vaughan noted the rawness of her performance, the seeming honesty of it.
“I don’t know if I’m reading into that because of knowing what she’s experienced,” Vaughan said.
“She deserves every challenge,” Gibson said, “because she’s up to it.”These days, Miller has more self-esteem.
She tells her adversary, “A lot of people think they know me.

     'Anatomy of a Scandal' charts a twisty courtroom mystery around privilege and politics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) An old-fashioned courtroom miniseries with a somewhat more modern backdrop of sexual politics, "Anatomy of a Scandal" is a crisply told, nicely binge-able mystery that doesn't overstay its welcome.
Adapted from a novel, the material certainly doesn't break any ground but proves watchable enough for its various twists, some admittedly more strained than others.
While it's a famous man who's on trial (hence the "scandal" part), the six-episode project is defined by two women: The lawyer prosecuting the case, and the wife who wants to stand by her husband but is given reason to doubt him.
The allegation and related revelations come as an understandable shock to Whitehouse's wife Sophie (Sienna Miller), who is plagued by images of the consensual liaison while finding it difficult to believe that her husband could perpetrate an act of violence.
As for proving that, the task falls to barrister Kate Woodcroft ( "Downton Abbey's" Michelle Dockery), who is taking a considerable professional risk by mounting such a high-profile prosecution, one that has implications for the governing party.

     Sienna Miller Netflix 'Anatomy of a Scandal' role brings her back to being a tabloid target
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sienna Miller, starring alongside Rupert Friend in the new Netflix thriller Anatomy of a Scandal, admits her personal past, particularly being a massive tabloid target in the 2000s, made her apprehensive about signing on to the series.
But the tabloid stalking continued for years, into other relationships, with Miller, just last year, settling with The Sun after suing the tabloid, accusing the publisher of hacking her phone to leak her pregnancy.
In Anatomy of a Scandal, adapted from Sarah Vaughan’s novel, there are a lot of similarities.
I admire that conflict.”Rupert Friend in Anatomy of a Scandal on Netflix'I found this whole world to be just nothing like my joyful place'Sienna Miller wasn’t the only person who had some reservations about Anatomy of a Scandal.
It’s a clique of male students, which included current British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and former prime minister David Cameron.
