     Summary: Seven-time All-Star Paul George brought smiles back onto the faces of Clippers fans last month with his long-awaited return to the hardwood.

Regardless, the Clippers will look to extend their season with a win against the Pelicans tonight.
If they lose, they’ll be eliminated from the play-in tournament.

     Summary: Credit: © Sergio Estrada-USA TODAY SportsThe Los Angeles Clippers have received terrible news, as their best player couldn't take part in tonight's game against the New Orleans Pelicans.
Paul George has entered the league's health and safety protocols, meaning he'll be out of action tonight when his team hosts the Pelicans, who beat the San Antonio Spurs in the other play-in tournament game.
According to Adrian Wojnarowski and Tim Bontemps of ESPN, the player is out of action tonight, which is obviously a big blow for the Clippers.

Still, not having George on the floor is a big hit, but Tyronn Lue always knows how to respond to adversity.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Clippers star Paul George has entered health and safety protocols and will be out of the lineup for Friday's win-or-go-home play-in game against the New Orleans Pelicans, according to ESPN's Tim Bontemps and Adrian Wojnarowski.
George, who missed most of the 2021-22 campaign with an elbow injury, returned to the Clippers lineup late in the season to lead the team — which has been without fellow superstar Kawhi Leonard — to the playoffs.
The 31-year-old averaged 24.3 points, 5.7 assists and 6.9 rebounds in 31 games this season.
He also led the Clippers with 34 points, five assists and seven rebounds in Tuesday's No.

     Clippers' Paul George tests positive for COVID-19, out for Friday's play-in game vs. Pelicans, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Clippers will be without star Paul George for their play-in game against the New Orleans Pelicans Friday night as he's entered the league's health and safety protocols after testing positive for COVID-19, per ESPN.
This is obviously a significant blow to a Clippers team with a shot at making the playoffs on the line against the Pelicans.
George put up 34 points in L.A.'s loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in its first play-in game on Tuesday, so losing him is incredibly detrimental to the Clippers playoff chances.
During that time, head coach Tye Lue elevated guard Terance Mann to the starting lineup in place of the injured George, which we could see happen again.
It'll be tough, especially against a Pelicans team where CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram just combined for 59 points against the Spurs, but it's not impossible.
