     Why Wil Wheaton Won't Accept Jerry O'Connell's Apology For Not Helping With Childhood Abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: YouTube / The Talk"You were 11"Wil Wheaton says Jerry O'Connell bears no responsibility for what happened to him as a child because, well, Jerry was just a kid too.
The '80s icon appeared on "The Talk" when O'Connell got deep about their childhood while filming 1986 classic "Stand By Me".
The sincere outpouring of empathy from O'Connell was met by protests from Wheaton who clearly felt no apology was needed.
Also, everyone in the audience who is a trauma survivor knows this: We're real, real, real good at covering up what we're going through."
"I wish I was older back then so I could have said, 'Hey Wil, hey man, is anything wrong?'"
