     Kanye West and Yeezy Architect Have Private Wedding Ceremony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kanye West isn't just hanging around town with a mystery blonde, he's also married to her -- they recently had a private ceremony to celebrate their love ... TMZ has learned.
Sources connected to the couple tell TMZ the woman is Bianca Censori, she hails from Australia and she's worked as an architectural designer at Yeezy for several years.
Our sources say Ye and Bianca recently had some sort of wedding ceremony -- though we're told it doesn't appear they've filed a marriage certificate to make it legal.
While the lyrics don't seem to directly tie him to her, there are some possible clues as to why he wanted a quickie wedding ceremony.
TMZ broke the story, Ye and Bianca were spotted sharing a meal and chatting at the Waldorf earlier this week.
