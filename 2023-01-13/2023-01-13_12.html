     CorSport: Serie A will debut semi-automated offside in Supercoppa derby
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AC Milan and Inter will square off in the Supercoppa Italiana on Wednesday next week and semi-automated offside will be devoted by the Lega for that clash.
Semi-automated was, of course, used in the World Cup and the technology uses sensors in the ball to determine if it’s offside or not with great precision.
AIA, the referees’ association, have been testing the technology for several weeks now and the Supercoppa final will be the first game.
It will then be used for the rest of the season in Serie A, as per the newspaper.
The Supercoppa will be played in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and kick-off is set for 20:00 CET.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Victor Osimhen scored twice and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia once, also setting up each other’s goals, to help the Serie A leaders Napoli crush second-placed Juventus 5-1 and open up a 10-point lead.
There is a strong rivalry between Napoli and Juventus and the visitors from Turin were roundly jeered by home supporters in Naples when they appeared.
Wojciech Szczesny brilliantly parried an acrobatic shot from Kvaratskhelia but Osimhen headed in the rebound, the the first goal Juventus had conceded in 770 minutes.

World Cup winner Di María pulled one back for Juventus three minutes before the break but that proved to be a false dawn for the Bianconeri.

With his back to goal, Arkadiusz Milik played a simple pass to the Argentine who, like Kvaratskhelia, curled a shot passed the goalkeeper.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022/23 Serie A season may well be the year that Napoli finally get their hands back on the Scudetto, and Friday evening provided a perfect look at their potential as they defeated Juventus 5-1 in Naples.
Juventus started the season terribly, with Massimiliano Allegri reportedly on the verge of dismissal for weeks, yet he has turned things around since November.
Yet it was this goal which sparked complacency within the hosts as Juventus pulled one back just two minutes later.
In the 55th minute Amir Rrahmani scored with a stunning shot from the edge of the penalty area after Juventus failed to clear a corner.
Wojciech Szczesny could do nothing with the fifth and final goal as Eljif Elmas' shot was deflected beyond the goalkeeper.
