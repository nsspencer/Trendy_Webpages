     Summary: Another night, another close game for the Utah Jazz.
Tonight, behind the scoring of Lauri Markkanen and the defense of Walker Kessler, the Jazz edged out the Orlando Magic 112-108.
His shot tonight wasn’t falling inside, but it didn’t matter.
Markkanen took 21 free throws tonight ... 21!
Walker Kessler becomes the first Utah Jazz rookie since @bigTbailey in 1984 to record 7+ blocks in a single game.

     Sixers kick off five-game road trip at Utah Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Sixers will take the court in Utah to take on the Jazz on Saturday evening for the start of a five-game West Coast road trip.
The contest was an overall defensive failure for the hosts, a concerning trend to start on the cusp of a five-game road trip to the West Coast.
As of Friday, Markkanen was shooting 7.1 3-pointers per game with a shooting percentage of 41.1 from long range.
The Sixers cannot let Markkanen and the Jazz do whatever they want in the same way they let Shai Gilgeous-Alexander run all over them last game.
The Jazz will also be on the second leg of a back-to-back when the Sixers come to town.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: About an hour and a half before tipoff, the Jazz announced that veteran point guard Mike Conley would be sitting out to rest on the opening end of a back-to-back.
But Jordan Clarkson, thrust into more of a play-making role with Conley shelved, had two assists against seven turnovers.
Still, each of the point guards acknowledged some difficulty in finding a consistent rhythm on this occasion.
And he acknowledged that, without Conley, things were not particularly seamless on Friday.
And the expectation is that Conley will suit up and help things along.

After the game Clarkson said that he was just in the right spot at the right time for the most part, and he’s right.
With the way this Jazz team is constructed, the Jazz need all the help they can get on the boards and Clarkson is averaging four rebounds per game, which matches his career-best.
