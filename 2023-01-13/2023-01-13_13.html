    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SALT LAKE CITY – The Utah Jazz are through week 13 of the NBA season so it’s time to examine how they’ve fared in the four factors of a successful season.
Youth Development: A-For the first time this season, Walker Kessler had some competition from a fellow Jazz rookie for the most recognition over the last week.
Ochai Agbaji had by far his best stretch of the season after being inserted into the regular rotation last week against the Houston Rockets.
NBA Standings: CIt was a good week for Jazz fans wanting to see the team’s lottery odds improve.
Markkanen has scored in double-digits in every game for the Jazz this season, and hasn’t failed to break the 20-point mark in 12 straight outings upping his season average to stellar 24.5 points per game.

     Orlando Magic narrowly lose to Utah Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SALT LAKE CITY – Lauri Markkanen scored 28 points and blocked Franz Wagner’s 3-pointer in the closing moments to power the Utah Jazz past the Orlando Magic, 112-108 on Friday night.
Jordan Clarkson, who had 23 points, scored the go-ahead layup, and rookie Walker Kessler made two free throws after rebounding Collin Sexton’s second of two missed free throws with 11.8 seconds to play.
I was relieved,” said Kessler, who shoots 55.7 percent from the line, of his late free throws.
The 7-foot Finnish star set career highs on both free throws made (17) and attempted (21).
The aggressive Markkanen has shot double-digit free throws five times in his last seven games.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: About an hour and a half before tipoff, the Jazz announced that veteran point guard Mike Conley would be sitting out to rest on the opening end of a back-to-back.
But Jordan Clarkson, thrust into more of a play-making role with Conley shelved, had two assists against seven turnovers.
Still, each of the point guards acknowledged some difficulty in finding a consistent rhythm on this occasion.
And he acknowledged that, without Conley, things were not particularly seamless on Friday.
And the expectation is that Conley will suit up and help things along.

     Summary: The Utah Jazz managed to eke out a win over the Orlando Magic on Friday night.
And as if it was all scripted, Kessler blocks another shot.
“Trying to go dunk everything and you’ll get some some calls.”Jordan Clarkson’s reboundingThe Jazz are not a great rebounding team, and especially not a great defensive rebounding team.
After the game Clarkson said that he was just in the right spot at the right time for the most part, and he’s right.
With the way this Jazz team is constructed, the Jazz need all the help they can get on the boards and Clarkson is averaging four rebounds per game, which matches his career-best.
