     Summary: In fact, Dr. King’s last demonstration of civil disobedience was on behalf of sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, who enlisted his aid during a lengthy strike for job safety, better wages and benefits and union recognition.
Actions like these are the reason why Dr. King’s immemorial and inspiring words “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?” continues to resonate to us in the spirit of what solidarity means to our labor movement.
As union members, let us continue to uplift Dr. King’s legacy by using his example as a guide, standing together undivided as we work together towards a brighter future.

     Summary: Today, we honor the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., by continuing his unfinished work to redeem the soul of America.
Dr. King came of age in the South during a time when racial discrimination was the law of the land.
His activism and moral authority helped usher in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, January 16, 2023, as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday.
I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service projects in honor of Dr. King and to visit MLKDay.gov to find Martin Luther King, Jr., Day of Service projects across our country.
