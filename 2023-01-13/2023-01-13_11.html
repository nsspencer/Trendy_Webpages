     Summary: Leeds United's Premier League relegation fears heightened as they slipped to a 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa on Friday, leaving Jesse Marsch's side without a win in their last seven games in all competitions.
Villa raced into the lead inside three minutes at Villa Park, with Leon Bailey sweeping the ball home on the end of a swift counter attack.
Given the chances they had in the match, Leeds will feel like their trip to the Midlands was an opportunity missed.
"It was important to score the second goal because they were playing well to try and score and they did," Emery said.
"It was important to have the advantage of the two goals to close the match and get the three points."
