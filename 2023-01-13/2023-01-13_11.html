     Missing Leopard Shuts Down Dallas Zoo, Crews and Dallas PD Searching for the Animal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS (WBAP/KLIF News ) – The Dallas Zoo is closed temporarily after a clouded leopard vanished from its habitat.
The Friday morning disappearance prompted zoo officials to issue a “code blue” – that’s a non-dangerous animal that is out of its habitat.
According to a Facebook post, the zoo said it believes due to the nature of the leopard, the animal is still on the grounds and hiding.
The Zoo is closed today as our teams work to find and recover the animal.

     Escaped Dallas Zoo Clouded Leopard May Have Been Taken – NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clouded leopards are small cats, about the size of a medium-sized dog and weighing about 30 pounds.
Dallas Police are helping the Dallas Zoo continue to search for a missing clouded leopard, a small cat that was initially believed to have escaped its habitat overnight but may have been taken.
The Smithsonian said that in the wild a clouded leopard will eat gibbons, macaques, slow loris, small deer and wild boars.
According to a map of the Dallas Zoo, the gibbon habitat is adjacent to the clouded leopard habitat.
In 2011, Koko, a chimpanzee at the Dallas Zoo, was sedated after briefly escaping from her enclosure.

     Clouded leopard missing from Dallas Zoo after fence ‘intentionally cut’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Dallas police have launched a criminal investigation after officials at the city’s zoo, searching for a clouded leopard that went missing Friday, determined that fencing for the big cat’s exhibit had been cut.
Zoo officials said they were not sure whether Nova is still on the grounds of the zoo.
Dallas police declined to provide any specific information about the investigation into who cut the clouded leopard’s fence or a possible motive.
In March, the zoo posted a video on its YouTube channel of its two clouded leopard sisters, Nova and Luna.
The sisters arrived at the Dallas Zoo from the Houston Zoo, she said.
