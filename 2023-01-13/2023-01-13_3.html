     Pirates To Sign Andrew McCutchen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The free-agent outfielder has agreed to a one-year deal to return to the Pirates, reports Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
The Pirates selected McCutchen, now 36 years old, with the No.
A true cornerstone player, McCutchen led the Pirates to their three most recent postseason appearances, in 2013, 2014 and 2015 — each a Wild Card berth.
McCutchen signed an early extension with Pittsburgh — a six-year, $51.5MM contract with a club option for a seventh season.
Beyond the contributions he’ll make on the field and the mentorship he’ll provide to several up-and-coming young Pirates, McCutchen will give fans plenty to cheer for in 2023 as he chases down multiple career milestones.
