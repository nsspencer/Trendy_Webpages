     Tesla Just Cut Prices on Model Y and Model 3. It's a Bad Day for the Stock.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla needed to cut prices of its cars in the U.S. Now it has.
That’s pushing down Tesla stock, but it isn’t the only reason for weakness.
On Thursday, the electric vehicle giant reduced pricing for several models, dropping them below a key level to qualify for U.S. tax credits.

     Tesla cuts U.S. prices on electric vehicles including Model 3, Y
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Driving the news: Elon Musk's firm has cut the price of its bestselling Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, along with its Model X sport utility vehicles and Model S luxury sedans.
The price changes could enable some buyers to qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit that can be applied to many electric vehicle models.
The big picture: The price cuts come as Tesla experiences a declining market share and analysts say the firm is facing a "significant demand problem."
Worth noting: Some investors, including Cathie Wood, have suggested price cuts could be welcome amid growing competition, especially as higher volumes could reduce production costs and make up for smaller margins.
Tesla missed analyst estimates for fourth quarter deliveries, and the company will report full year financial results for 2022 on Jan. 25.

     Tesla turns up heat on rivals with global price cuts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Competition is coming and they are responding with price cuts,” said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital.
The U.S. price cuts on Tesla's global top-sellers the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover SUV were between 6% and 20%, Reuters calculations showed, with the basic Model Y now costing $52,990, down from $65,990.
REUTERS/Mike BlakeFor a U.S. buyer of the long-range Model Y, the new Tesla price combined with the U.S. subsidy amounts to a discount of 31%.
Before the price cut, the five-seat version of the Model Y had been ineligible, which Musk called "messed up."
In China, where Tesla cut prices last week by 6-13.5%, owners protested at delivery centres, calling for compensation.

     Tesla shares fall on US and European price cuts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More stable cost inflation was also a factor in reducing prices, said a spokesperson for Tesla Germany, confirming price cuts in its top European market.
The US price cuts, announced late Thursday on its global top-sellers the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover SUV, were between 6% and 20%, Reuters calculations showed.
For a US buyer of the long-range Model Y, the new Tesla price combined with the US subsidy amounts to a discount of 31%.
In China, where Tesla cut prices last week by 6% to 13.5%, owners protested at delivery centres, calling for compensation.
Before the cuts, Tesla inventory in the United States, as tracked by models its website shows as immediately available, had been trending higher.
