    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tesla keeps slashing prices, this time by as much as 20%Tesla has once again lowered prices of its EVs — this time for U.S. buyers — as the automaker scrambles to shore up demand.
The price reduction trend kicked off in October when Tesla announced price cuts in China up to 9% on the Model 3 and Model Y.
Earlier this month, Tesla reduced prices for Chinese buyers again, this time by nearly 14%.
Tesla in early December offered U.S. buyers a $3,750 credit toward a Model Y or Model 3 if they had their vehicle delivered in December 2022.
The long-range Model Y crossover now starts at $52,990 (not including fees), a nearly 20% drop in price.

     Summary: “Competition is coming and they are responding with price cuts,” said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital.
Tesla also cut prices for its Model X luxury crossover SUV and Model S sedan in the United States.

Reuters Graphics'PUNCH IN THE GUT'Tesla fans and customers complained the price cuts disadvantaged those who had recently bought a vehicle.
In China, where Tesla cut prices last week by 6-13.5%, owners protested at delivery centres, calling for compensation.

     Tesla shares fall on US and European price cuts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More stable cost inflation was also a factor in reducing prices, said a spokesperson for Tesla Germany, confirming price cuts in its top European market.
The US price cuts, announced late Thursday on its global top-sellers the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover SUV, were between 6% and 20%, Reuters calculations showed.
For a US buyer of the long-range Model Y, the new Tesla price combined with the US subsidy amounts to a discount of 31%.
In China, where Tesla cut prices last week by 6% to 13.5%, owners protested at delivery centres, calling for compensation.
Before the cuts, Tesla inventory in the United States, as tracked by models its website shows as immediately available, had been trending higher.
