    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Manchester City players are not happy at all and immediately surroud the referee to ask for explanations to his decisions, probably on the first Manchester United goal, where Rashford was clearly interfering with play.
The first half was quite an even affair, with City huffing and puffing and Manchester United looking to pounce on the counter.
The second half was going entirely in favour of Manchester City, who had the old flow back and were looking very dangerous from all areas.
But if you don't kill Manchester United twice, they don't die.
That results leaves Erik ten Hag's side just ONE point behind Manchester City, who are in full crisis mode now.

     How Manchester United came from a goal down to beat Manchester City 2-1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United had failed to score in their previous three fixtures against rivals City but found the net twice in four nets to secure a dramatic 2-1 victory at Old Trafford.
Yet, it was City that took the lead in the second half as substitute Jack Grealish's headed goal out the reigning Premier League champions in front.
A controversial moment saw United equalise as Casemiro rolled a pass to release Rashford, who was offside.
Rashford's goal moments later gave United the lead and Ten Hag's side saw the match out to secure the three ponits.
As a result, United leapfrog Newcastle in the table into third and are just a point behind second-placed Man City.
