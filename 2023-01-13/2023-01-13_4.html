     Missing clouded leopard found after shutting down Texas' largest zoo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A missing clouded leopard caused Texas' largest zoo to shut down Friday before the zoo said she was found on its grounds and safely secured.
The Dallas Zoo said grounds were closed Friday morning due to a “serious situation,” and that Dallas police were helping search for 4-year-old Nova — one of the zoo’s two clouded leopard sisters.
The search was focused on scouring trees, which Edell said clouded leopards like to climb.
The zoo added that Nova was being evaluated by veterinary staff, though "initial indications are she is not injured."

     Dallas Zoo closes to search for missing clouded leopard
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Langford/Getty Images(DALLAS) — The Dallas Zoo has closed its doors Friday as it searches for a clouded leopard that appears to have escaped from its enclosure.
“One of our clouded leopards was not in its habitat when the team arrived this morning and is unaccounted for at this time,” the zoo said in a statement on Twitter.
Dallas Zoo said it issued a “code blue,” for a non-dangerous animal outside of its habitat.
Clouded leopards are found in southeast Asia and China and males grow to be about 50 pounds, according to the Smithsonian Institute.
The zoo said Dallas police are on the scene as they continue to search for the big cat.

     Summary: Dallas Zoo officials say they have found and secured the clouded leopard that disappeared from her habitat earlier in the day.
"One of our clouded leopards was not in its habitat when the team arrived this morning and is unaccounted for at this time."

     Escaped Dallas Zoo Clouded Leopard Found – NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Texas Sky Ranger's camera was rolling when the missing clouded leopard, Nova, was captured inside the Dallas Zoo property during NBC 5 First at Four.
The Dallas Zoo was closed Friday while the search for the clouded leopard was underway.
The Smithsonian said that in the wild a clouded leopard will eat gibbons, macaques, slow loris, small deer and wild boars.
According to a map of the Dallas Zoo, the gibbon habitat is adjacent to the clouded leopard habitat.
In 2011, Koko, a chimpanzee at the Dallas Zoo, was sedated after briefly escaping from her enclosure.
