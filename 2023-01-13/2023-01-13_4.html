     Summary: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Archbishop Timothy P. Broglio of the Archdiocese of the Military Services, USA, and president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has issued a statement:“People keep saying, ‘Where’s the next Martin Luther King?’ We’re all called, I think.
We’re all called to free ourselves and to free one another.” - Sister Thea Bowman, FSPAToday, when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. would have celebrated his 94th birthday, we reflect on his legacy of a non-violent struggle against racial injustice.
Beyond remembering and quoting Dr. King today, we must act to address racial disparities in the criminal justice system, access to affordable housing and healthcare, and economic opportunities.
The USCCB continues to support policy changes in these areas of society.
Remembering that Dr. King was guided first by his faith also challenges us to personal conversion.
