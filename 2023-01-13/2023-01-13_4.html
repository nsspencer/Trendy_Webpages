     Steph Curry's Hilarious Reaction to Warriors Breaking Road Struggles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors have been dreadfully bad on the road all season.
Their dominant home record has carried their overall record, because the team has struggled mightily away from Chase Center.
This was just Steph Curry's second game back from injury, and he looked a little more comfortable out there despite the unique environment.
Curry's return will go a long way towards making that a possibility, and perhaps this solid road victory will be the start.
The Warriors will look to build off this win throughout their road trip.

     Draymond Green Gives Brutally Honest Answer About Leaving Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Their trio of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green is one of the most accomplished in NBA history; however, it may not last forever.
"Quite frankly, the writing is on the wall," Green said.
You're setting yourself up for heartbreak.
While he knows the writing may be on the wall, Green would still love to remain with the Warriors.
It will be very interesting to see how things play out with Draymond Green and the Golden State Warriors.

     NBA attendance record: Spurs-Warriors sets new mark at Alamodome, but one coach thinks it's just the beginning
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Antonio Spurs and Golden State Warriors set an NBA record for attendance on Friday, as an official crowd of 68,323 flocked to the Alamodome in San Antonio.
The previous record for attendance at an NBA game was the matchup between the Chicago Bulls and Atlanta Hawks at the Georgia Dome in March of 1998, which drew 62,046 fans.
Before Friday, the Spurs' attendance record was 39,554, set during Game 2 of the NBA Finals against the Knicks in 1999.
The monumental number of 68,323 in San Antonio on Friday shattered the previous record, but one NBA coach thinks that it's just the beginning.
Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra said on Friday that he wants to see an NBA game draw 100,000 fans.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The possibility that this could be Draymond Green's last season with the Golden State Warriors has been well chronicled.
But saying Green is going to be, or could be, with the Warriors for a few more years, and saying he's going to be there for the rest of his career, are two different things.
I would call it unlikely that Green stays with the Warriors forever.
Green isn't quite the player he once was, but he's still playing terrific basketball.
The Warriors will have to gauge how long they think that will last, because when the decline happens, it could be steep.

     Summary: The Warriors made 18 3-pointers in the game, but more impressively scored a season-high 70 points in the paint.
Fast forward almost five years to Friday night, and it was both DiVincenzo and Poole leading their team to victory.
DiVincenzo's 22 points were the second most in the game, and the most he has scored in a game since April 8, 2021.
Warriors Head Coach Steve Kerr was also a part of that game, coming off the bench for the Bulls in their victory.
Friday also marked the Spursâ€™ first game at the Alamodome since Game 4 of the 2002 Western Conference Semifinals vs. the Lakers.

     The Warriorsâ€™ relentless rim assault against the Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Spurs also allow plenty of opponents to get to the rim for up-close attempts.
Even if they allow lots of rim attempts, the Spurs are a respectable 12th in opponent rim accuracy (66.1%).
It tracks when you consider the frequency of rim attempts the Spurs allow, and how itâ€™s representative of their lack of capable point-of-attack defense across the board.
Their lack of rim attempts is a consequence of their offensive philosophy.
With Poeltl being the only legitimate source of rim protection, the Spursâ€™ outnumbered (and undersized) backline canâ€™t deal with Looneyâ€™s finishes at the rim.
