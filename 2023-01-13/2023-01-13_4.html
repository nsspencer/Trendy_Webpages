     Missing clouded leopard shuts down Texas' largest zoo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A missing animal caused Texas' largest zoo to shut down Friday.
The Dallas Zoo said grounds were closed in a tweet Friday morning due to a “serious situation,” and that Dallas police were helping search for 4-year-old Nova — one of the zoo’s two clouded leopard sisters.
The zoo issued a “code blue” emergency - which means a non-dangerous animal is unaccounted for.

     Dallas Zoo closes after clouded leopard escapes enclosure
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Zoo officials and Dallas police are searching for a clouded leopard that is missing from its exhibit at the Dallas Zoo.
“Given the nature of these animals, we believe the animal is still on grounds and hiding,” the zoo said.
The Dallas Zoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN.
In March, the zoo posted a video on its YouTube channel of two clouded leopard sisters, Nova and Luna.
The sisters arrived at the Dallas Zoo from the Houston Zoo, she said.

The clouded leopard habitat is in Primate Place, in the northwest part of the zoo, north of Clarendon Drive.

According to a map of the Dallas Zoo, the gibbon habitat is adjacent to the clouded leopard habitat.
