     Chelsea open talks with PSV Eindhoven over Noni Madueke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea are in talks with PSV Eindhoven over a potential deal to sign winger Noni Madueke.
Madueke previously represented Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace at youth level before joining PSV on a three-year deal in 2018 and later extending his stay until the summer of 2025.
PSV coach Ruud van Nistelrooy has expressed the Dutch side’s wish to keep Madueke but admitted they may be powerless to stop an exit.
Chelsea, who are 10th in the Premier League under head coach Graham Potter, are currently without 10 injured first-team players.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea will be without Raheem Sterling for next week’s Premier League match against Liverpool with the England international likely to remain sidelined with a hamstring injury for at least another two weeks.
Sterling, 28, sustained the injury during the opening stages of Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat against Manchester City in the Premier League on January 5.
AdvertisementChelsea, who have lost both of their games since, had initially hoped that Sterling could return in time for their trip to Liverpool on January 21.
But he is now expected to miss that game, with a return in time to face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League the more likely target, as he continues to be assessed daily.
Chelsea currently have no fewer than 10 first-team players sidelined due to injury.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following Chelsea 2-1 defeat to west London rivals Fulham, the ESPN FC crew ponder what the future holds for their coach Graham Potter.
(2:04)Chelsea manager Graham Potter has ruled out the prospect of Christian Pulisic leaving the club this month following his knee injury.
"No chance [of Pulisic leaving], no," Potter said.
"He's here, he had a problem with his back after [the league game against] Manchester City and that's why he was absent [in the FA Cup game against] City," Potter said.
He's in our squad, he's an important player for us and I'm pretty sure he can help us going forward."

A fee is yet to be agreed between the two clubs for the England U21 international.
The 20-year-old spent time in Tottenham and Crystal Palace's youth academies before moving to Dutch club PSV on a three-year-deal in 2018.
After making his debut for PSV in January 2020, he has gone on to make 50 appearances, scoring 11 goals.
"It'd be surprising if Mudryk didn't end up being an Arsenal player by the end of the transfer window.

     Crystal Palace-Chelsea Preview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Patrick Vieira has warned his Crystal Palace players to ignore Chelsea’s poor run ahead of Sunday’s Premier League contest and instead focus on their own disappointing form.
The Ivory Coast international’s 18 shot-ended carries is behind only Liverpool’s Darwin Nunez (19) among Premier League players this term, with three of those ending in the back of the net.
– Two of the first four Premier League games between Chelsea and Crystal Palace were draws – since then, none of the last 23 between them has finished level (19 Chelsea wins).
– No side has lost more games (4) or won fewer points (4) in Premier League London derby matches than Crystal Palace this season.
Indeed, Potter’s only managerial win home or away against the Eagles was this season’s reverse Premier League meeting with Chelsea at Selhurst Park, a 2-1 victory.
