     Summary: "Rooting for My Baby"Another quietly confident number on 'Bangers', "Rooting for My Baby" feels grounded by the artist's country music roots.
Sitting in a different sonic world from the rest of the album at a time where Miley was grafting to be taken seriously as an artist, it foretold what we now know well - whether she's embracing pop or rock, Miley Cyrus is an artist with range.

     Miley Cyrus: “Flowers”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “New year, new Miley” read the wheatpaste posters beside the exposed slice of stomach that’s somehow recognizable, all by itself, as Miley Cyrus.
But even the pop star’s most ambitious aesthetic makeovers never truly manage to detract from the fundamental Miley-ness of her affairs.
Sucks that her original material is often not as compelling.
But calling it revenge is a reach, not when Shakira is ready to call you a Twingo: What we’re really dealing with here is self-help, and as a pitch for loving yourself first, “Flowers”’ visions of long-stemmed bouquets and long walks on the beach couldn’t be more generic.
“No remorse, no regret/I forget every word you said,” Miley sings, and it might have been more interesting if she didn’t sound so sincerely unbothered.

     With 'Flowers,' Miley Cyrus Ushers In an Assured New Era
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When it comes to Miley Cyrus, you should always expect the unexpected.
Since departing her reign on Disney Channel, she’s delivered one curveball after the next—and her latest single, “Flowers,” is no different.
Miley Cyrus is all grown up—and it shows.
Thematically, “Flowers” is a classic breakup anthem where Cyrus realizes she’s fine on her own.
If my suspicions are correct, Endless Summer will mark a new era for Cyrus: one of healing, renewal, and perhaps, a bit of revenge.

     Miley Cyrus’ Lead Singles, Ranked: Critic’s Picks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Miley Cyrus announced that she would be kicking off 2023 with the release of “Flowers,” a new single to precede her forthcoming album Endless Summer Vacation, the news was exciting on two levels: a new Cyrus single was coming, but perhaps more importantly, a new Cyrus lead single was coming.
So which lead singles illustrate Cyrus’ pop power most effectively, especially now that there’s a new one to consider?
All eight of Cyrus’ lead singles have their charms — truly, not a flat-out dud in the bunch — but some of her songs excel as both previews of their host albums and standalone gems in her catalog.
And while it’s still early days for “Flowers,” we tried our best to consider its place among Cyrus’ lead singles to date, and humbly rank the new track among the seven that have stood tall for years.
Here are Miley Cyrus’ lead singles, ranked.

     Summary: In recent years, Hollywood has done some phenomenal work to explore the sensitive topic of homosexuality.
In the past years, many celebrities have struggled with considerable homophobia when they first came out publicly.
Actor Michael Kearns and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres faced huge backlash and hatred when they announced that they were gay.
The fight against gender and orientation stereotypes is far from over, even in a progressive space like Hollywood.
But, there is now a newer generation of celebrities who are out and proud and giving a voice to queer issues and speaking up against discrimination.

     Summary: Over a decade later, that audacious flare is seemingly the main character in her music videos.
Miley came on the scene with hardcore energy and gave the girls a bop that she herself is still obsessed with to this day.
06 “Don’t Call Me Angel” To this day, “Don’t Call Me Angel” is a misunderstood bop.
However, what I can’t deny is the quality of its music video, which sees Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande, and Lana Del Rey teaming up for some fallen angel fun.
In this era, Miley was in the early throes of her mesmerizing rockstar alter ego.
