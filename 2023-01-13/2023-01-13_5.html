     Steph Curry's Hilarious Reaction to Warriors Breaking Road Struggles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors have been dreadfully bad on the road all season.
Their dominant home record has carried their overall record, because the team has struggled mightily away from Chase Center.
This was just Steph Curry's second game back from injury, and he looked a little more comfortable out there despite the unique environment.
Curry's return will go a long way towards making that a possibility, and perhaps this solid road victory will be the start.
The Warriors will look to build off this win throughout their road trip.

     NBA attendance record: Spurs-Warriors sets new mark at Alamodome, but one coach thinks it's just the beginning

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Antonio Spurs and Golden State Warriors set an NBA record for attendance on Friday, as an official crowd of 68,323 flocked to the Alamodome in San Antonio.
The previous record for attendance at an NBA game was the matchup between the Chicago Bulls and Atlanta Hawks at the Georgia Dome in March of 1998, which drew 62,046 fans.
Before Friday, the Spurs' attendance record was 39,554, set during Game 2 of the NBA Finals against the Knicks in 1999.
The monumental number of 68,323 in San Antonio on Friday shattered the previous record, but one NBA coach thinks that it's just the beginning.
Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra said on Friday that he wants to see an NBA game draw 100,000 fans.

     Shocking Stephen Curry stat proves Warriors are worst team in the NBA without him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s no secret that Stephen Curry is the most important player on the roster for the Golden State Warriors.
If you need further proof of how integral Curry is to the Warriors, then feast your eyes on this stat: Golden State is first in the NBA in offensive efficiency (118.2) whenever Steph’s playing.
Curry returned to action on Tuesday after missing nearly a month of action due to a shoulder injury.
Curry actually bought a suite for the game, which will be held in the Spurs’ former stadium, the iconic Alamodome.
Needless to say, it would be the perfect venue for Stephen Curry to come out with one of his trademark explosions.
