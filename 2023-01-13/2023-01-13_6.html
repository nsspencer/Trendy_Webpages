(Photo by Jared Wickerham/Getty Images) Getty ImagesAndrew McCutchen, who won National League MVP honors for the 2013 Pittsburgh Pirates, is going home again at age 36.
During his MVP campaign in 2013, McCutchen hit .317 with a .404 on-base percentage and .508 slugging average while stealing 27 bases.

     Pirates To Sign Andrew McCutchen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The free-agent outfielder has agreed to a one-year deal to return to the Pirates, reports Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
The Pirates selected McCutchen, now 36 years old, with the No.
A true cornerstone player, McCutchen led the Pirates to their three most recent postseason appearances, in 2013, 2014 and 2015 — each a Wild Card berth.
McCutchen signed an early extension with Pittsburgh — a six-year, $51.5MM contract with a club option for a seventh season.
Beyond the contributions he’ll make on the field and the mentorship he’ll provide to several up-and-coming young Pirates, McCutchen will give fans plenty to cheer for in 2023 as he chases down multiple career milestones.
