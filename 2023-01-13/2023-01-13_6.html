     Napoli vs. Juventus: Picks, predictions, how to watch Serie A match

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: League leaders Napoli will take on second-place Juventus in a battle at the top of the Serie A table in Matchday 18.
Napoli are coming off a 2-0 win over Sampdoria last week while Juventus won their eighth straight league match with a 1-0 win over Udinese.
Napoli have lost once all season as they sit at the top of the table with 44 points.
A win over Napoli would get them that much closer to the league leaders as they look to close the gap.
I’d take Napoli to get the win at home as they’ve been playing next level this season in pursuit of their first Serie A title since the 1989-90 season.

     Napoli vs Juventus : Lineups and LIVE updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Luciano Spalletti's side now face another stern test of their title credentials as they host a resurgent Juventus in Friday night's highly anticipated Serie A clash.
Juventus have recovered admirably after their sluggish start to the season, and a win in Campania would cut the gap to four points, putting title-favourites Napoli under even more pressure.
Napoli's outstanding season has been helped by their imperious home form, as they have yet to taste defeat in front of their fans.
The Old Lady of Turin, meanwhile, will welcome Monza in the last 16 of the Italian cup.
They will return to league action with a home game against Gian Piero Gasperrini's Atalanta in a tricky-looking fixture, followed by another league encounter against Monza at the Allianz Stadium to cap off the month of January.

     Summary: Italy’s top two teams collide on Friday when a rejuvenated Juventus travel south to Serie A leader Napoli in the hopes of reducing the seven-point gap that separates the pair.

Napoli won’t be willing hosts, however, considering only Lecce can say they’ve succeeded in taking points—or a point—from the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona this term following their draw in August.
Not only are Juventus without a win at the ground since 2019, but Allegri’s side has also scored just twice from their last four visits to the ground while conceding five in response.

     Summary: What a performance that was.
Apart from a brief spell at the end of the first half when Juve were on top, it was a dominant performance from Luciano Spalletti's side.
Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia form a lethal pair and it's imperative that they remain injury-free.
Mario Rui looked excellent, especially in the first half and Anguissa was a rock in the centre of the park for Napoli.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Few the weeks leading up to the 2022 World Cup, it seemed that the position of Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri was more than in doubt.
Things were not good enough also in the domestic league, with Juventus losing against newly promoted team AC Monza away on Sept. 15.
Juventus managed to qualify for the Champions League but expectations increased for the second season under Allegri after his comeback.
Allegri counted on the players he knew he could trust in the most difficult moment since he rejoined Juventus.
On Friday against Napoli, we will know if that was enough also to become a Scudetto contender for the 2022-23 season.
