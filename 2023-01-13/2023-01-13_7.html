Villa has won just one of its four games since the Premier League resumed following the World Cup—a morale-boosting 2-0 win away at Tottenham—though the pursuit of consistency remains a problem.
By that logic, Emery’s hosts should get at last a point out of Leeds given they haven’t recorded back-to-back defeats since October.
