     All The Digs at Liam Hemsworth in Miley Cyrus's ‘Flowers’ Music Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s a bit of a jab at her ex, Liam Hemsworth, but also an ode to a sort of modern, West Coast Patrick Bateman.
We meet Cyrus on a bridge in Los Angeles, in a shot shared as a teaser image for the song and music video.
“Flowers” reportedly samples Bruno Mars’ “When I Was Your man” and many of the lyrics mirror that of Mars’ 2012 song.
Fans of the singer have claimed that Hemsworth once dedicated Mars’ song to Cyrus, making its use that much more of a dig at the Australian actor.
In what is arguably the best scene of the video, Cyrus breaks out dancing to her chorus in a stark, modern room overlooking the pool and Los Angeles.

     Miley Cyrus: “Flowers”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “New year, new Miley” read the wheatpaste posters beside the exposed slice of stomach that’s somehow recognizable, all by itself, as Miley Cyrus.
But even the pop star’s most ambitious aesthetic makeovers never truly manage to detract from the fundamental Miley-ness of her affairs.
Sucks that her original material is often not as compelling.
But calling it revenge is a reach, not when Shakira is ready to call you a Twingo: What we’re really dealing with here is self-help, and as a pitch for loving yourself first, “Flowers”’ visions of long-stemmed bouquets and long walks on the beach couldn’t be more generic.
“No remorse, no regret/I forget every word you said,” Miley sings, and it might have been more interesting if she didn’t sound so sincerely unbothered.

     Song of the Week: Miley Cyrus Can Buy Herself “Flowers,” Thank You Very Much
    </h2>

     Summary: Song of the Week breaks down and talks about the song we just can’t get out of our head each week.
This week, Miley Cyrus brings a little disco moment to the beach.
Miley Cyrus has played with genre extensively throughout her career, and it’s probably because her voice just sounds good in every single one of them.
Her highly-anticipated new album, Endless Summer Vacation, arrives March 10th, and Cyrus describes it as her “love letter to LA.” “Flowers” is the first single from Endless Summer Vacation, and the new era of Miley is officially off to a dreamy, glittering start.
Her raspy vocals offer an edge to the disco-toned anthem, leaving us all excited to see what else Endless Summer Vacation has in store.

     Miley Cyrus' "Flowers" Lyrics Show She's Still Moving On From Liam Hemsworth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The arrival of “Flowers,” the lead single of her upcoming album Endless Summer Vacation, however, isn’t exactly that — but isn’t not exactly that either.
Though it’s never directly stated, clues overwhelmingly point to Liam Hemsworth, Miley’s ex-husband and the man who appears to be the big heartbreak of her life.
The song starts on a wistful note, reminiscing about a past relationship that ends on the biggest signifier that she’s talking about Hemsworth.
That last line undoubtedly feels like a direct reference to Hemsworth and Cyrus' shared Malibu home, which they devastatingly lost in 2018 to the Woosley fires.
And maybe, Cyrus wrote “Flowers” many years ago, when the wound was still fresher.

     Miley Cyrus drops new song 'Flowers' on Liam Hemsworth's birthday — is it a diss track?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Miley Cyrus has planted some clever seeds in the lyrical garden of "Flowers," her new song that many fans have interpreted as about her relationship with ex-husband and Australian actor Liam Hemsworth.
Speculation began when Cyrus dropped the song on Jan. 13 — the Hunger Games star's 33rd birthday.
Another user spliced the song's lyrics together with Bruno Mars' 2012 song "When I Was Your Man," which sees him singing about missing a departed partner.
Cyrus' lyrics are strikingly similar: "I can buy myself flowers, and I can hold my own hand.
