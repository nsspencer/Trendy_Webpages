     The Splash Zone 2/1/23: Vic Fangio to Dolphins not official yet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was reported on Sunday the Miami Dolphins and Vic Fangio agreed to terms on a deal that would make him the highest paid coordinator in the NFL.
But for whatever reason, the move hasn’t been made official by the Dolphins or Fangio.
We bring you a rundown of Miami Dolphins news from the last 24 hours.
The Miami Dolphins Offensive Line has Improved, but they Need to be Better in 2023.
The NFL salary cap is climbing this offseason, how does that impact the Miami Dolphins?

     The Miami Dolphins should slam the door on hiring Vic Fangio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images)It pains me to write this considering Vic Fangio is a fellow northeast PA man.
Still, given how he is reportedly jerking the Miami Dolphins around, the Miami Dolphins need to look elsewhere to fill their defensive coordinator position.
But then Monday morning came and Vic Fangio still didn’t, officially, sign with the Miami Dolphins.
It’s embarrassing for the Miami Dolphins to look like a fool here being held up by a defensive coordinator.
The Miami Dolphins should move on and go right after Sean Desai.

     Will the Broncos bring back Vic Fangio?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After making Sean Payton their new head coach, the Denver Broncos might bring back a familiar face for Payton’s coaching staff.
Even before Payton joined the Broncos, there was heavy speculation that he would want Vic Fangio to be his defensive coordinator on his next team.
In fact, Dave Logan of KOA Radio reported on Tuesday evening that the Broncos are already negotiating with Fangio.
NFL Network reported on Sunday that Fangio had agreed to terms with the Dolphins, but Fangio himself shot down that report through multiple reporters.
Fangio was fired by the Broncos following the 2021 season after he went 19-30 in three seasons as a head coach.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vic Fangio was reportedly the Miami Dolphins‘ defensive coordinator — until he wasn’t.
Will Vic Fangio Sign With the Dolphins?
Sources in Mobile tell Pro Football Network Insider Tony Pauline that they are confident Fangio will become the new defensive coordinator for the Dolphins sooner rather than later.
San Francisco is an option, but everything being talked about at the Senior Bowl points to Fangio signing with the Dolphins – soon.
Dolphins cornerback Xavien Howard, who had a disappointing year in 2022, should also benefit from Fangio coming to the Dolphins.
