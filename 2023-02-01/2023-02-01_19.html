     Michael Malone to coach Team LeBron at 2023 All-Star Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Team LeBron finally has its coach for the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, with the league giving the honor to Denver Nuggets sideline boss Michael Malone.
“Denver Nuggets head coach Michael Malone and his staff will coach Team LeBron in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game,” the NBA Communications’ official Twitter page posted Wednesday night.
Michael Malone earned the right to coach Tem LeBron by virtue of the Nuggets having the best record in the Western Conference “through games played on Sunday, Feb. 5.”This is not going to be the first rodeo of Michael Malone as a head coach in an All-Star Game, as he called the shots for Team LeBron back in the 2019 edition of the event.
Under Michael Malone, the Nuggets have become a perennial NBA title contender.
Malone, of course, was a part of the Warriors coaching staff before he went to the Sacramento Kings and then eventually to Denver.

     Nuggets' Michael Malone to Coach Team LeBron in 2023 NBA All-Star Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AAron Ontiveroz/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty ImagesDenver Nuggets head coach Michael Malone and his staff have been selected to coach Team LeBron at the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, the league announced Wednesday night.
The news comes after the NBA announced earlier in the week that Boston Celtics interim head coach Joe Mazzulla and his staff would coach Team Giannis.
There's no guarantee Malone will coach Jokić in the game, either.
He would have to be selected by the Team LeBron captain, Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, during the All-Star Game draft.
Malone also coached Team LeBron in the 2019 All-Star Game in Charlotte.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone will head up Team LeBron James at the NBA All-Star Game in Salt Lake City later this month.
The coach with the best record in each conference leads the All-Star team that corresponds to their conference's top vote recipient from the fans.
That means that Boston Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla will lead Team Giannis antetokounmpo, and Malone, as of Wednesday's Memphis Grizzlies loss, has officially clinched the right to coach Team LeBron.
This is the second All-Star Game Malone will coach, as he led Team LeBron to victory in the 2019 All-Star Game against Mike Budenholzer and Team Giannis.
Of course, there's not too much a coach can do to affect the outcome of an All-Star Game.

     Nuggets 'likely' to move Bones Hyland at 2023 NBA trade deadline, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nuggets second-year guard Bones Hyland is one of the players "likely" to get moved, according to Marc Stein.
If Denver does decide to move on from Hyland, the young guard won't be angry.
When recently reacting to hearing his name pop up in trade rumors, Hyland sounded pretty indifferent.
It doesn't bother me at all," Hyland said of being mentioned in trade rumors.
As a young guard with a seemingly high upside, Hyland could prove to be one of the more intriguing players available across the league.
