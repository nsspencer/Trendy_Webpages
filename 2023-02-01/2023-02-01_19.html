    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: YouTubeThe home includes a carpeted bathroom/sitting room, a bedroom with no windows and a media room covered in tiger print.
"Stranger Things" star David Harbour and wife Lily Allen opened their doors to Architectural Digest for a tour of their Brooklyn townhome -- and it didn't disappoint.
The duo appear in the magazine's March issue and gave a video tour for the publication's YouTube channel.
Harbour -- who previously showed off his bachelor pad in 2019 -- exclaimed at the top of the clip.
The tour began with the pair walking through their "plain English kitchen," something Allen apparently said she wanted on their first date.

     David Harbour and Lily Allen shock fans with their home tour
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But now David Harbour and his wife singer Lily Allen have given a tour of their new property and it could not be more different to his loft.
David and Lily, who got married in 2020, gave Architectural Digest a tour of their newly decorated Brooklyn town house.
And let's just saying the house is very different to David's old place and fans cannot get over the difference in the two properties.
Many fans were really into this room of the home (us included) but it's the rest of the house the fans are in shock with.
The tour continues with a look into Lily and David's closets, which are downright incredible.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the bottom floor, the pair created a quirky media room complete with tiger-print carpet and a matching lounge.
Off the media room is even a black toilet, which David admitted was his idea.
However, one of the most impressive rooms is the luxurious and oversized kitchen, which David said was designed with the iconic film The Godfather in mind.
In their luxurious home, Lily and David also have a lavish loungeroom they call the 'garden room'.
Lily said her actor father Keith Allen bought her the flamingo artwork that now hangs above her and David's pink bed.
