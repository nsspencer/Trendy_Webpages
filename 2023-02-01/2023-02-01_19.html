     Suns Notes: Booker, Crowder, Wainright, Trade Options
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Suns guard Devin Booker has been ruled out for Wednesday’s game vs. Atlanta, but it shouldn’t be long before he’s back on the court, according to Duane Rankin of The Arizona Republic (Twitter link), who hears from a source that Booker will return “soon” from the left groin strain that has sidelined him since Christmas Day.
After hosting the Hawks today, the Suns will embark on a five-game road trip that begins Friday in Boston.
It remains to be seen whether Booker will be ready for the start of that trip, but it sounds like there’s a very good chance he’ll play at some point before the team returns to Phoenix on February 14.
Booker was reevaluated on Wednesday, with the Suns announcing that the star guard continues to make progress in his on-court activity and will have his status updated on a game-to-game basis going forward (Twitter link via Gerald Bourguet of PHNX Sports).

     Devin Booker injury update: Suns star could return from groin strain by Tuesday vs. Nets, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker could return to the lineup as soon as next Tuesday against the Brooklyn Nets, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
Booker has been out for five weeks with a strained left groin.
The Suns were the Western Conference frontrunners in December, but they are 8-10 since Booker went down and have since slid all the way to seventh place.
Now that he's returning, the Suns will have most of their roster available to them for the first time in quite some time.
The Suns have reportedly been active on the trade market, and once they make it back to full strength, they would be among the scariest teams in the Western Conference.

     Summary: The Phoenix Suns are getting closer to being near whole again, as Devin Booker may return as soon as Tuesday night against the Brooklyn Nets, according to ESPN insider Adrian Wojnarowski.
The Suns said Wednesday that he will be considered for a return each game day.
Before missing three games, Booker dropped 58 points in a win over the New Orleans Pelicans at Footprint Center on Dec. 17.
Booker inferred in a tweet on Wednesday that his return was coming soon:Roundin’ 3rd — Book (@DevinBook) February 1, 2023“I don’t want to miss any games,” Booker told reporters Wednesday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ultimately, the Hawks on Wednesday night played well and the Suns did not.
That was about it, enough to make it a rather uneventful 132-100 Suns loss.
By then, the way the game was trending wore on the Suns’ effort, which doomed them.
The Suns’ first game back home won’t be until Valentine’s Day, and that could be the case for Devin Booker as well.
While the Hawks loss will be dispiriting for some, the Suns are still a game over .500 and have won six of their last eight games.
