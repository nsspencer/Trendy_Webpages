     Wakanda Forever’s Ironheart Could Set Up Shang-Chi 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wakanda Forever has a throwaway line that sets up Demetrius this, with Riri saying her red muscle car was left to her by her dad.
Wakanda Forever established a bond between Riri, Shuri (Wright), and Okoye (Danai Gurira), so apart from the pretty fanciful Wellspring, none of this is much of a reach for Ironheart or Shang-Chi 2.
Then again, tacking Riri’s story onto the latter would only reignite complaints she was shoehorned into Wakanda Forever.
The MCU’s Ten Rings organization dates back to 2008’s Iron Man and was a divisive background group up until Shang-Chi.
There was the maligned Mandarin twist of Iron Man 3, while a scene involving a mysterious member was cut from Ant-Man.

     'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' Finally Hit Disney Plus: What to Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Black Panther: Wakanda Forever took longer to start streaming on Disney Plus than any other Marvel movie in the pandemic era.
Is Black Panther: Wakanda Forever streaming?
The movie became available to stream on Disney Plus early Wednesday morning, starting at 12:01 a.m. PT/3:01 a.m.
How long will it take for Disney Plus to stream Marvel's next movies?
However, Wakanda Forever may have been held off Disney Plus so long because of a consideration that won't apply to the next Marvel films coming out this year: With a Black director and predominantly Black cast, Wakanda Forever is debuting on Disney Plus on the first day of Black History Month.
