    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last week, for the first time, I watched Bill Murray play the part of Phil Connors, in the movie "Groundhog Day."
His boss sends him to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, eighty miles away, to report on the town's annual Groundhog Day celebration, set for February 2.
He asks someone what day it is and learns that it is February 2, Groundhog Day.
It is again February 2, Groundhog Day.
"Groundhog Day," was first released on February 4, 1993, thirty years ago this week, and to celebrate its anniversary, movie officials plan to release the film this month in select theaters.

     ‚ÄòGroundhog Day‚Äô Hits 30: Comedy‚Äôs Team on ‚ÄúTense‚Äù Shoot, Bill Murray Tapping Into ‚ÄúDark Side‚Äù
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bill Murray in 'Groundhog Day.'
When director Harold Ramis and producing partner Trevor Albert stumbled upon the screenplay for Groundhog Day, no one knew it would become a film that viewers would (voluntarily) watch over and over.
Having followed National Lampoon‚Äôs Vacation with 1986‚Äôs underperforming Club Paradise, Ramis wanted his next project to aim outside the box.
Ultimately, the role went to Bill Murray, Ramis‚Äô longtime collaborator on such films as Caddyshack and Ghostbusters.
‚ÄúIt was a tense shoot for a number of reasons,‚Äù says Albert, given the conflicts between the pair.

     Summary: Groundhog Day was the natural candidate.
One of the more questionable elements of Groundhog Day ‚Ä¶ Andie Macdowell and Bill Murray fall in love.
Watching Groundhog Day every day for a year provided me with a deeper appreciation for how a film may contain multitudes ‚Äì particularly those we choose to willingly re-experience.
The legacy of Groundhog Day can be seen in the recurring appeal of the time-loop narrative in TV shows and films such as Palm Springs, Russian Doll and Happy Death Day.
On reaching the finish line I was elated and celebrated with a final viewing on the big screen.

     The bizarre history of Groundhog Day and Punxsutawney Phil
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN ‚ÄîEvery year, Americans in snowy states wait with bated breath to see whether Punxsutawney Phil will spot his shadow.
Every February 2, the members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club trek to Gobbler‚Äôs Knob, Punxsutawney Phil‚Äôs official home just outside of town.
While May 1 became May Day, and November 1 became All Saints‚Äô Day, the February 1 holiday was pushed to the following day ‚Äì and would eventually become Groundhog Day.
The phrase ‚Äúgroundhog day‚Äù even became shorthand for that d√©j√† vu feeling of reliving the same day over and over.
Last year, the apparently immortal and married groundhog Punxsutawney Phil predicted six more weeks of winter.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For reasons lost to marketing history, ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù was released not on Groundhog Day in 1993, but 10 days later, on Feb. 12 of that year.
And of course, the northwest suburban city of Woodstock, which stood in for Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in the movie, will forever celebrate and be remembered as the setting for ‚ÄúGroundhog Day.‚ÄùWhether you have ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù on Repeat and you watch it every year (oh the joyous irony!)
Chicago stage alum Michael Shannon had his first film role in ‚ÄúGroundhog Day,‚Äù playing Fred, the young groom whose fianc√© has second thoughts on their wedding day, until Phil counsels the couple and they go through with it.
Over the years, we‚Äôve seen a myriad of movies and films that were variations on the repeat-the-same-day routine, including ‚ÄúChristmas Again,‚Äù ‚ÄúPalm Springs,‚Äù ‚ÄúRussian Doll,‚Äù ‚ÄúHappy Death Day,‚Äù ‚ÄúMeet Cute,‚Äù ‚ÄúBoss Level,‚Äù ‚ÄúSource Code‚Äù and ‚ÄúEdge of Tomorrow‚Äù and in 2017 there was ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù the musical, which garnered seven Tony nominations ‚Äî but thankfully, we‚Äôve never had a direct sequel to ‚ÄúGroundhog Day.‚Äù Which is as it should be, as perfect movies should be left alone.
‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù is screening Thursday and Sunday at local theaters (see fathomevents.com for details) and over and over, time loop style, on AMC from 10 a.m. Thursday until 1 a.m. Friday.
