    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Revenue in the fourth quarter fell 4% from a year earlier, marking a third straight quarter of declining sales.
Meta shares popped in extended trading on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter revenue that topped estimates and announced a $40 billion stock buyback.
Meta said it expects revenue in the first quarter of between $26 billion and $28.5 billion.
Earlier this week, Snap reported fourth quarter earnings that missed on sales, sending its shares tumbling.
Meta shares plummeted by over 60% last year, as Zuckerberg struggled to sell Wall Street on his plan to pivot the company towards the yet-to-be-developed world of the metaverse.

     Meta shares surge nearly 20% as Zuckerberg pledges to make 2023 a ‘year of efficiency’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York CNN —For years, Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg invested heavily in growth, including in areas like virtual reality with unproven potential.
All of that helped send shares of Meta up nearly 20% in after hours trading Wednesday.
Meta reported nearly $32.2 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 4% from the year prior but ahead of the $31.5 billion analysts had projected.
The guidance is somewhat better than Snapchat-parent Snap’s from earlier in the week, which said it expects first quarter revenue to fall between 2% and 10% compared to the previous year.
The company also lost a total of more than $13.7 billion in its “Reality Labs” unit which houses its metaverse efforts.
