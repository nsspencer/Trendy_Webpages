     Ice Storm Warning could mean power outages, more flight cancellations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the National Weather Service now posting an Ice Storm Warning for much of North Texas it's likely we are going to see a lot of power outages and flight delays.
But under today's Ice Storm Warning, we could see an estimated half-inch of ice or more building up on trees, and that's plenty enough to take down limbs and those falling limbs will take down power lines with the expected outages following.
At the two major North Texas airports travelers should expect more cancellations and delays as the airlines have to stop what they're doing to de-ice the planes before takeoff.
Good morning, North Texas!
At Dallas Love Field, cancellations amounted to more than 300 along with about 60 delays.
