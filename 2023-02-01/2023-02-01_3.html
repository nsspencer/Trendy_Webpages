     Alec Baldwin Charged with Manslaughter Following Rust Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The first rule of gun safety is never to point a gun at someone you don’t intend on shooting," reads the affidavit.
Actor Alec Baldwin has now officially been charged with manslaughter following the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the western movie, Rust.
According to a report via Variety, Baldwin has been charged as both producer and actor on the project, with a statement of probable cause saying that Baldwin should never have aimed the gun at Hutchins.
“The first rule of gun safety is never to point a gun at someone you don’t intend on shooting,” reads the statement, which adds that Baldwin failed to undergo “required firearms training prior to the commencement of filming."
Baldwin’s attorney Luke Nikas has described the decision to charge the actor a “miscarriage of justice” saying, “This decision distorts Halyna Hutchins’ tragic death and represents a terrible miscarriage of justice.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.
Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed maintain their innocence and have vowed to fight the charges.
Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun – or anywhere on the movie set,” the statement said.
The manslaughter charges against Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed include two alternative standards and sanctions.
Halls had agreed to plead guilty in the negligent use of a deadly weapon, explaining that he may have handled the gun improperly before it was given to Baldwin, prosecutors said.
