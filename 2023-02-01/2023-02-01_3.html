     Eagles' Josh Sills indicted on rape and kidnapping charges in Ohio, placed on commissioner exempt list
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia Eagles guard Josh Sills has been indicted by a grand jury on rape and kidnapping charges in Ohio, per The Philadelphia Inquirer.
Per WKBN, the indictment states that Sills engaged in sexual activity that was not consensual, and held the victim against her will.
The case was presented to a grand jury, which recommended the charges announced by Ohio prosecutors on Wednesday.
Later on Wednesday, Sills was placed on the commissioner exempt list, which means he may not participate in practices, play in games or travel with the team.
Sills played in just one game this past season, recording four special teams snaps in a 20-17 win over the Arizona Cardinals.
