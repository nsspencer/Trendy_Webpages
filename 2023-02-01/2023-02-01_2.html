She uploaded a post to Instagram early Wednesday morning with the caption: “RENAISSANCE WORLD TOUR 2023,” and her official website has been updated to show the tour dates.
Following the release of her seventh album, Renaissance, in July, fans have been itching for a tour announcement, in addition to music videos to accompany the songs.

     Beyoncé Announces ‘Renaissance’ Stadium Tour Dates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As expected, Beyoncé has announced a 2023 world tour on Instagram, supporting her multiple-Grammy-nominated 2022 album, “Renaissance.” She also released the dates and cities on her official website.
The timing of the announcement, which comes just days before the Grammy Awards on Sunday, sparks speculation that the singer may perform or at least appear on the show.
Beyoncé has said that “Renaissance” is a three-part project, so it’s possible that the next parts could be another album, a long-form video project or even the tour itself.
Beyoncé’s last full tour was the nearly six-month, 49-date “Formation” tour in 2016, which unusually featured no guest appearances until the final show, at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium, where she brought out Kendrick Lamar and Jay-Z.
It seems possible that a future “Renaissance” video project could be part of that deal as well.
