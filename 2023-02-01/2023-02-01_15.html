     Harris at Tyre Nichols’ funeral: This isn't public safety
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: … When we talk about public safety, let us understand what it means in its truest form,” Harris said of the police action that killed Nichols.
“Tyre Nichols should have been safe.”Harris traveled to Memphis for the funeral, which was held at Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church.
“They told her she shouldn’t be here today, but the snow backed up and she’s here,” Sharpton said of Harris at the funeral, to applause.
Biden previously said he was “outraged” watching the video of the police violence that led to Nichols’ death.
While lawmakers including Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) called for reform in the wake of the attack, Republicans including Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) have actively resisted doing the same.
