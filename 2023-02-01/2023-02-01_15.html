     La Liga Accuses Premier League of Cheating After Record $1B Spend in Transfer Window
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: THOMAS COEX/AFP via Getty ImagesOfficials from La Liga were sharply critical of the Premier League after English clubs spent a combined £815 million ($1 billion) during the January transfer window.
La Liga president Javier Tebas shared a video from Javier Gomez, the league's corporate general director, who contrasted La Liga's finances with that of the Premier League (via ESPN.com).
He said shareholders of La Liga clubs can spend money "within certain limits" and that those barriers aren't in place for English clubs.
Gomez went on to add Premier League owners are "doping" their clubs.
But the present situation could renew calls for an alternative to the Champions League that allows clubs outside England to catch up.

     Premier League transfer market is ‘doped’ with ‘barbaric amounts’ spent — La Liga president
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: La Liga president Javier Tebas believes the Premier League transfer market is “doped” and the large spending of its clubs threatens the sustainability of European football.
Premier League sides spent £815million ($1bn) in the January transfer window (per Deloitte) — more than 30 times the expenditure of their La Liga counterparts (£25million).
“The British market is a doped market,” Tebas said.
“You can see it clearly in this winter market, where Chelsea have made almost half of the signings in the Premier League.
“Following the history of the last few seasons, we have done some work at LaLiga, because the Premier League is a competition that loses billions of pounds in the last few years.

     Summary: “You can see it clearly in this winter market, where Chelsea have made almost half of the signings in the Premier League.
“The record spending by Premier League clubs this season is beyond anything that we’ve seen before,” he said.
According to Deloitte, only £25m was spent on players from the Football League.
“The decline in spending across the English football system is likely to be of growing concern for members of the English Football League and could further fuel the debate around distributing finances more evenly across the pyramid,” said Bridge.
“Across Europe, many clubs have sold some of their most valuable talent to other leagues, particularly the Premier League, as they look to prioritise financial sustainability,” said Deloitte’s Calum Ross.

     Premier League is 'financially doped', says LaLiga president

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Feb 1 (Reuters) - Spain's LaLiga president Javier Tebas has said teams in the Premier League are "financially doped" after they spent a record $1 billion in the January transfer window and outspent the rest of Europe’s ‘big five’ leagues by almost four to one.
When contacted by Reuters, the Premier League said that the figures presented by LaLiga were not correct.
"In the Premier League it is the opposite.
Until June 2021, the Premiership and the Championship had lost 3000 million euros ($3.28 billion), the Spanish LaLiga lost 250 million euros.
In the same period, the Premier League and Championship shareholders put in 3500 million euros, in Spain they put in 450 million euros.

     Spain’s La Liga rails against England’s Premier League for ‘cheating’ after €1 billion January transfer mega splurge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: La Liga chiefs have slammed the Premier League for ‘cheating’ after an insane January transfer window that saw English clubs splurge almost €1 billion.
In light of such profligacy, Gomez has called on UEFA to take action and prevent clubs from spending more than they can afford.
In the 2022-23 season, Premier League clubs spent a total of £2.8bn ($3.5bn), breaking the previous record set in 2017-18.
Gomez stated in a video posted by La Liga president Javier Tebas on Twitter: “We are aware there is a lot of talk about how LaLiga’s economic control means Spanish clubs sign less than Premier League clubs.
“The reality is that at La Liga we want clubs to spend what they can afford and generate themselves, that is to say their own revenues.

     Summary: La Liga president Javier Tebas speaks during the World Football summit in Madrid Credit: AlamyLa Liga corporate director Javier Gomez has accused the Premier League of “cheating” after clubs spent a combined $1billion (£815million) in January.
This sort of spending has not gone down well with La Liga president Javier Tebas, as well as the league’s corporate director Javier Gomez.
Tebas has had plenty to say about the spending of Premier League clubs over the years, saying last September that he would go to UEFA to tattletale.
“We should not get really obsessed with the question of whether the Premier League pays much more.
He said: “We are aware there is a lot of talk about how La Liga’s economic control means Spanish clubs sign less than Premier League clubs.
