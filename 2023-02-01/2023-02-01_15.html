     Netflix password-sharing crackdown details released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The "Sharing your Netflix account" pages on the streaming giant’s Help Center for Costa Rica, Chile and Peru on Wednesday said "anyone in your household (those who live with you at your primary location)" can use a Netflix account.
Or the owner of the account that outsiders have been using can add them as an "extra member," according to those webpages.
That additional monthly fee will be charged to the person whose account the "extra member" gets added to.
To detect devices linked to the primary location of an account, the company said it utilizes IP addresses, device IDs and account activity.
Those so-called "trusted devices" allow users to stream content on Netflix when not at the primary location.

     Netflix's Anti-password Sharing Measures Start To Take Form, Here's The First Breakdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix account sharing crackdown has officially begun after the company posted details of its first anti-password sharing policies on its site.
The added member account will have to be created within the same country as the primary owner, so it’s unclear if this will affect cross-border account sharing.
These caveats do not cover the full extent of Netflix's anti-password rules.
Some users won’t mind the extra charge, and the number of devices available for simultaneous viewing won’t change for any plans.
However, until Netflix sorts out pricing and anti-password sharing rules enter other countries, users won't be able to decide if Netflix's new content for 2023 is worth the hassle.

     Here's exactly how Netflix will prevent you from password sharing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We knew it was coming, and we knew it was coming soon: Sharing Netflix passwords outside of your household is about to become a lot harder.
But we had no idea how, exactly, Netflix plans to prevent people from sharing their passwords – until now.
But if you're away for an "extended period of time" — presumably, more than 31 days — Netflix says that "your device may be blocked from watching Netflix."
The solution to this is requesting a "temporary access code to continue watching," Netflix says.
For example, I primarily watch Netflix on my smart TV, but I'm logged in on a variety of other devices, such as phones and tablets.

     Netflix Password Sharing Crackdown Means You Must ‘Check In’ At Home Once A Month
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Courtesy of Netflix © 2022 Courtesy of NetflixNew details are emerging about how Netflix plans to enforce its upcoming global crackdown on password sharing, which right now is live in just a few countries including Chile, Costa Rica and Peru.
One constant question through all this is how Netflix is going to prove who is account sharing and who is just traveling or staying in a second household.
I’m sure that’s an easy process…Netflix claims 100 million people are password sharing on Netflix, and they want to convert at least some portion of those into active users with their own accounts or add-ons to existing ones.
And a lot of annoyed customers who get frustrated with Netflix if X or Y device is blocked in X or Y location and they have to call Netflix tech support to sort it out.
You may see all streaming services start to adopt this, as while they may not be saying it publicly like Netflix, none of them want people password sharing fundamentally.

     Netflix reveals first details of password sharing crackdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix (NFLX) has revealed the first details of its password sharing crackdown.
As a result, Netflix will require users to identify a "primary location" for all accounts that live within the same household.
Netflix warned in the its quarterly letter to shareholders it will be intensifying its push to combat password sharing.
Today’s widespread account sharing (100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as build our business," the company said.
Coupled with a crackdown on password sharing, Netflix will also rely on its newly launched ad-supported tier to lift profitability, especially as competition within the streaming space escalates: "As always, our north stars remain pleasing our members and building even greater profitability over time."
