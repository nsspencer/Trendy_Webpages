     The Federal Reserve raised rates. Chair Powell says it's 'premature' to declare victory against inflation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The central bank is nearing the end of its rate hike campaign and was more dovish this meeting, according to Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
A lack of clarity on future interest rate moves signals the Fed is nearing the end of is rate tightening cycle, Ripley said.
After hikes end, he said the central bank will likely "sit tight while the economic data catches up to the policy."
Ripley added that the slowing pace of current rate hikes to 25 basis points is a "clear sign" that the central bank is more confident that current economic policy is having its intended impacts of tightening.
Taken all together, Ripley said the meeting "tilted slightly dovish."

     Fed approves smallest rate hike since March, in nod to improved inflation outlook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The decision, at the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee’s first meeting of 2023, comes after months of jumbo-sized rate increases intended to cool the economy, and marks the return to a more traditional interest-rate policy.
Fed officials nodded towards those trends in its statement on Wednesday, writing that “inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated.”And while Fed officials are slowing rate hikes after months of unusually aggressive action, the central bank is far from declaring victory.
Wednesday’s statement included language that made it clear policymakers expect that more hikes will be necessary to temper inflation.
While those trends could make the case for slowing rate hikes after months of unusually aggressive action, the central bank is far from declaring victory.
Senior Fed officials like Vice Chair Lael Brainard and Governor Christopher Waller have in recent weeks stressed the need to see six months of positive data before they stop hiking rates.
