     Ziyech loan move from Chelsea to PSG collapses
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Julien Laurens explains why Hakim Ziyech was unable to complete a deadline day move from Chelsea to PSG.
(1:45)Hakim Ziyech will not join Paris Saint-Germain on loan from Chelsea due to late paperwork causing the deal not to be registered by the French football governing body (LFP), sources have told ESPN.
- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)The LFP legal committee met on Wednesday to discuss the registration but decided against approving the loan.
PSG had hoped to bring Ziyech in on loan for the remainder of the season as a replacement for Pablo Sarabia, who left for Wolves last week.
Ziyech joined Chelsea from Ajax in the summer of 2020 in a deal worth up to €44 million but has struggled to hold down a regular first-team place under three different managers.

     PSG win, but at what cost? Winners, losers &amp; ratings as Mbappe nightmare overshadows victory over Montpellier
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And for 55 minutes, it seemed like things would actually be going from bad to to worse for the French champions.
Sergio Ramos and Kylian Mbappe both went off injured in the first half, while Neymar was left out altogether due to muscle fatigue.
Mbappe did have time to step up and take a penalty before he was replaced, but saw both his original effort and a retake saved.
In Mbappe's absence, it was an unlikely hero who stepped up in the shape of midfielder Fabian Ruiz.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lionel Messi scored a stellar goal as Paris Saint-Germain returned to winning ways, but 3-1 victory over Montpellier came at a cost as star Kylian Mbappe limped off in the first half on Wednesday at the Stade de la Mosson.
"It's a knock on the knee and it hurts behind the thigh," manager Christophe Galtier said after the match.
The France forward, though, had his spot kick parried away by Benjamin Lecomte in the eighth minute, but had to take it again and the Montpellier keeper again denied him.
Arnaud Nordin pulled a goal back for Montpellier shortly before full-time, but PSG's Warren Zaire-Emery added their third as the defending Ligue 1 champions picked up an important three points.
Ligue 1 leaders PSG take on Bayern Munich in their Champions League round of 16 first leg in two weeks.

     PSG's Kylian Mbappe, Sergio Ramos come off injured as Champions League clash vs. Bayern Munich looms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kylian Mbappe had an evening to forget on Wednesday as he missed from the penalty spot twice and went off injured during Paris Saint-Germain's 3-1 win away at Montpellier HSC in Ligue 1.
There was also history made as Warren Zaire Emery became the youngest goal scorer in the capital club's history having not even turned 17 yet.
However, the night was mainly about Mbappe and the question of his eligibility to face Bayern Munich at Parc des Princes in just under two weeks.
Hardly ideal when Neymar is already suffering from "muscular fatigue" and the star trio of Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi is struggling for collective form.
Despite all of that, RC Lens' 1-0 loss at home to OGC Nice coupled with Olympique de Marseille's 2-0 win away at FC Nantes has actually stretched PSG's lead atop Le Championnat to five points.

     Summary: PARIS, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Lionel Messi scored as Paris St Germain stretched their Ligue 1 lead to five points with a 3-1 win at Montpellier after Kylian Mbappe limped off the pitch on Wednesday.
Following a lacklustre first half PSG burst into life after the break with Fabian Ruiz, Messi and Warren Zaire-Emery finding the net to put them on 51 points from 21 games.
Mbappe had a night to forget at La Mosson, having had his spot-kick parried away by Benjamin Lecomte in the eighth minute.
He had to take it again, only for the Montpellier keeper to deny him again.
England Under-21 striker Folarin Balogun bagged a hat-trick to help Stade de Reims beat Lorient 4-2 and move top of the scorers' charts.

Defending champion PSG is five points ahead of Marseille, which won 2-0 at Nantes to move one point ahead of Lens into second spot for the automatic Champions League place.
Marseille scored in the 58th when Nantes central defender Joao Victor put the ball into his own net when tackling on-rushing winger Cengiz Ünder inside the penalty area.
New signing Azzedine Ounahi, a midfielder with World Cup semifinalst Morocco, added the second goal in stoppage time on his Marseille debut.
His 14 goals put him one ahead of PSG striker Kylian Mbappé.

     PSG transfer deadline day: Hakim Ziyech loan from Chelsea thwarted by red tape
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris Saint-Germain had agreed to sign Hakim Ziyech on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season, but the move failed due to registration issues.
Ziyech, 29, has fallen down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge while PSG's need for greater creativity has risen since the FIFA 2022 World Cup.
However, communication issues involving Chelsea, PSG, the Premier League and the French Professional Football League (LFP) offices means that this one did not get done.
Keylor Navas did join Nottingham Forest on loan until the end of the season without an option to buy.
PSG enabled that switch with Athletic Club making the signing of Ander Herrera permanent to keep within the loan number limits.

     Summary: Paris Saint-Germain extended their lead at the top of Ligue 1 with a 3-1 win at Montpellier on Wednesday but their evening was overshadowed by an injury to Kylian Mbappe, who had earlier missed a penalty.
Speaking after the game, coach Christophe Galtier suggested the injury was down to a knock rather than a muscle problem.
"He took a knock to the back of the knee or the back of the thigh, so we'll see," said Galtier.
PSG host Bayern in Paris on February 14, with the second leg in Germany on March 8.
Monaco in fourth beat Auxerre 3-2, while fifth-placed Rennes eased to a 3-0 win against struggling Strasbourg.
