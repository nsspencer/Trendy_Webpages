     Alec Baldwin 'missed firearm training' on set of Rust
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alec Baldwin missed firearm training before filming 'Rust' and was "distracted" during a catch-up session, prosecutors have claimed.
They stated: "Baldwin directly pointed a firearm at Hutchins and Souza.
Had Baldwin performed the required safety checks with the armorer, Reed, this tragedy would not have occurred.
"In addition, if Baldwin had not pointed the gun at Hutchins and Souza, this tragedy would not have occurred."
Halyna's death was previously ruled an accident but her family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Alec and others involved in the production.

However, legal experts aren't convinced this is the strongest argument against Baldwin.
Baldwin's lawyer previously called the decision to charge the actor with involuntary manslaughter a "miscarriage of justice."

     Alec Baldwin scheduled for court on charges in set death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA FE, N.M. — (AP) — Alec Baldwin’s first court appearance has been set as he confronts accusations of firearm safety failures and involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on a New Mexico film set.
Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.
In newly filed court documents, prosecutors said reckless safety failures accompanied the film production from the outset.
Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun – or anywhere on the movie set,” the statement said.
She also highlighted Baldwin as the person "that held the gun, that pointed the gun and that pulled the trigger."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alec Baldwin missed mandatory firearms training before filming began on Rust and was distracted by his family on set, according to court filings.
Prosecutors in New Mexico filed formal charges of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin, 64, and armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed over the death of Halyna Hutchins on Tuesday.
“Baldwin’s deviation from known standards, practices and protocol directly caused the fatal death of Hutchins,” Mr Shilling added.
