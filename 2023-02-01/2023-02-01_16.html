     Summary: On the bottom floor, the pair created a quirky media room complete with tiger-print carpet and a matching lounge.
Off the media room is even a black toilet, which David admitted was his idea.
However, one of the most impressive rooms is the luxurious and oversized kitchen, which David said was designed with the iconic film The Godfather in mind.
In their luxurious home, Lily and David also have a lavish loungeroom they call the 'garden room'.
Lily said her actor father Keith Allen bought her the flamingo artwork that now hangs above her and David's pink bed.
