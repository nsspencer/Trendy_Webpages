     Meta stock perks up as the company promises a ‘year of efficiency’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The company beat revenue expectations in the final quarter of 2022, bringing in $32.2 billion.
Those gains combined with Meta’s aggressive cuts and its promise of an efficient 2023 drove stock prices up around 15% in trading after-hours.
Meta took a notable beating in 2022’s market turndown, losing as much as 60% of its value over the course of the year.
“Our management theme for 2023 is the ‘Year of Efficiency’ and we’re focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization,” Zuckerberg said.
In the call, Meta’s chief executive called out Instagram Reels and the company’s algorithmic recommendation engine as two major areas of focus in the coming months.

The company reported 2 billion daily active users—an increase of 4% year-over-year and more than the 1.99 billion expected.
Meta’s stock plummeted last year as CEO Mark Zuckerberg prioritized the company’s focus on the metaverse, which he has repeatedly billed as a revolutionary, immersive online experience.
TangentMeta announced last week it was reinstating former President Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts, which were banned for two years following the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.

     Meta stock soars following revenue beat, positive outlook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares for Facebook parent Meta jumped more than 17% in after-hours trading Wednesday, after the tech giant beat Wall Street expectations on revenue and user growth.
Of note: Meta also provided positive first quarter guidance and said it expects expenses for the full year to be lower than originally forecasted.
Why it matters: Investors no longer expect Meta to grow at the same blockbuster pace that it used to.
Be smart: The company's optimistic projections for its first quarter revenue are an important update considering Meta competitor Snap Inc. on Tuesday told investors that it expects revenue to decline 2%-10% in the same time period.
The big picture: Wednesday's earnings end a year-long losing streak on Wall Street for the company.

     Meta shares surge nearly 20% as Zuckerberg pledges to make 2023 a ‘year of efficiency’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York CNN —For years, Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg invested heavily in growth, including in areas like virtual reality with unproven potential.
All of that helped send shares of Meta up nearly 20% in after hours trading Wednesday.
Meta reported nearly $32.2 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 4% from the year prior but ahead of the $31.5 billion analysts had projected.
The guidance is somewhat better than Snapchat-parent Snap’s from earlier in the week, which said it expects first quarter revenue to fall between 2% and 10% compared to the previous year.
Fourth quarter Reality Labs revenue fell 17% to $727 million, due to lower sales of its Quest 2 headset, the company said.
