     Samsung's newest Galaxy S smartphones a test of brand power in weak market
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [1/7] Samsung Electronics' flagship smartphone Galaxy S23 is seen on display at an unveiling ceremony in Seoul, South Korea, January 30, 2023.
Analysts said the Galaxy S23 smartphone series, with its cameras and faster chips than its predecessor, could still face weak demand as consumers spend less amid surging inflation in a struggling global economy.
It is Samsung's first-ever 200-megapixel camera sensor, and the series uses Qualcomm Inc's (QCOM.O) Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile processor.
Qualcomm said that with the S23 series, 100% of the processors use the Qualcomm chip.
In the United States, the base Galaxy S23 will be priced from $799 and two higher-specification versions, the S23 Plus and S23 Ultra, from $999 and $1,199, respectively.

     Samsung Galaxy S23 &amp; S23+ hands-on and how to pre-order

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the same roadmap as most recent big name phone launches, Samsung’s three new smartphones, the Galaxy S23, S23+ and S23 Ultra, are sleeker, more powerful versions of last year’s handsets.
Galaxy S23 and S23+ price and preordersPreorders for Samsung’s Galaxy S23 and S23+ start on Feb 1 and you can get up to a $100 credit — or $150 if you use our exclusive link — as well as an upgrade to the next storage tier when you reserve your new phone from Samsung.
Over at Verizon, you can get a free Samsung Galaxy S23 or $800 off any of the Samsung Galaxy S23 phones with select trade-in on qualified 5G Unlimited plans — which goes for anyone switching to Verizon or upgrading an existing phone.
The Galaxy S23 and S23+ are all about incremental changesTobey Grumet/CNNThe S23 and S23+ are not going to be groundbreaking smartphones, but they will offer a few new features for anyone interested in an upgrade.
While the Galaxy S23 Ultra will get a significant camera bump up to a 200-megapixel sensor from the S22 Ultra’s 108 megapixels, the S23 and S23+ will offer more incremental changes.

     Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360: hands-on &amp; how to pre-order
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Galaxy Book series has consistently impressed us with its range of slim, attractive and versatile designs, so it’s no surprise that Samsung isn’t reinventing the wheel for the Galaxy Book 3 range — though it is bringing a powerful new member to the family.
This year’s lineup consists of the Galaxy Book 3 Pro, the convertible Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360 and the debuting Galaxy Book 3 Ultra, the latter of which features the highest end Intel and Nvidia chipsets for serious productivity and immersive PC gaming.
Galaxy Book 3 price and preordersAll three Galaxy Book 3 models are available for preorder now, and will ship on Feb. 17.
The 16-inch Book 3 Pro 360 starts at $1,900 in the same colors, while the 16-inch Book 3 Ultra will run you at least $2,400 and comes only in Graphite.
Slim looks, big power and cross-device functionalityMike Andronico/CNNI spent the majority of my hands-on time with the Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360, a mouthful of a laptop that improves on the Book 2 Pro 360 we really dug last year (seriously, Samsung needs to streamline these names).

     The Galaxy Book3 Ultra is Samsung’s shot at the MacBook Pro
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Samsung has announced the Galaxy Book3 Ultra, a 16-inch workstation laptop with a 120Hz OLED screen, an H-Series Core i7 or Core i9, and an RTX 4050 or 4070 GPU.
It’ll start at $2,399.99 ($100 cheaper than the base MacBook Pro 16), with a release date still to be announced.
Like its siblings in the Galaxy Book3 line, a big draw of this workstation will be its screen.
Elsewhere, using the device felt pretty similar to using any number of other Samsung Galaxy Books, with a satisfyingly clicky keyboard, a smooth finish, a high-quality build, and a compact chassis.
The Book3 Ultra is priced fairly similarly to a MacBook Pro; the base Book3 is $100 cheaper than the base MacBook Pro 16 with the same RAM and storage.
