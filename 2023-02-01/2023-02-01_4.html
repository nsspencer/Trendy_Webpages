    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's Black History Month.
Here are three things to know about Black History Month:It was Negro History Week before it was Black History MonthIn 1926, Carter G. Woodson, the scholar often referred to as the "father of Black history," established Negro History Week to focus attention on Black contributions to civilization.
Across the country, public schools "created all these courses and mandates for Black history," unofficially creating a Black History Month, King says.
Today, Black History Month is also celebrated in Canada every February and the United Kingdom in October.
However, Black History Month has been and can continue to be a force for better understanding.
