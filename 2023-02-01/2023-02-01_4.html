     Summary: GUERNSEY COUNTY, Ohio (WXIX) - A Philadelphia Eagles offensive lineman has been indicted on rape and kidnapping charges a week and a half before Super Bowl LVII.
Joshua Sills, a 25-year-old rookie for the NFC Champion Eagles, is facing felony charges for a crime that allegedly happened on Dec. 5, 2019, according to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost.
The alleged crime was reported “immediately” and the Guernsey County Sheriff’s Office “conducted a detailed investigation,” Yost explained.
Sills was issued a summons to appear in Guernsey County court on Feb. 16, four days after his team’s Super Bowl appearance, according to Yost.
After news of the indictment broke early Wednesday, Sills was placed on the Commissioner Exempt List, according to ESPN’s Eagles reporter Tim McManus.
