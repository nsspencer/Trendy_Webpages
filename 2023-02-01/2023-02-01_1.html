     Prosecutors file charges in set shooting by Alec Baldwin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In recent weeks, Carmack-Altwies has outlined two sets of involuntary manslaughter charges in connection with the shooting.
Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed maintain their innocence and have vowed to fight the charges.
Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun – or anywhere on the movie set,” the statement said.
Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.
Prosecutors have said that Baldwin’s involvement as a producer and as the person who fired the gun weighed in the decision to file charges.

The manslaughter charges against Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed include two alternative standards and sanctions.
Halls had agreed to plead guilty in the negligent use of a deadly weapon, explaining that he may have handled the gun improperly before it was given to Baldwin, prosecutors said.
