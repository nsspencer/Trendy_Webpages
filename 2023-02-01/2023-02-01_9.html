Punxsutawney Phil will make his prediction Thursday morning at Gobbler’s Knob.
In 2021, The Inner Circle had to close off Gobbler’s Knob to protect Punxsutawney Phil from COVID-19.

     Summary: Feeling a tad “been there/done that,” I was reminded that Groundhog Day was approaching and that I know very little about it.
“What’s the story behind Groundhog Day?” I tippy-tapped, having only a rudimentary knowledge of the bogus holiday.
Perhaps I should propose a Groundhog Day celebration in Sullivan County next year.
Fun Fact: “Groundhog Day” is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott.
Murray portrays Phil Connors, a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, PA, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Every year, Americans in snowy states wait with bated breath to see whether Punxsutawney Phil will spot his shadow.
Every February 2, the members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club trek to Gobbler’s Knob, Punxsutawney Phil’s official home just outside of town.
While May 1 became May Day, and November 1 became All Saints’ Day, the February 1 holiday was pushed to the following day – and would eventually become Groundhog Day.
The phrase “groundhog day” even became shorthand for that déjà vu feeling of reliving the same day over and over.
Last year, the apparently immortal and married groundhog Punxsutawney Phil predicted six more weeks of winter.

     Summary: Last week, for the first time, I watched Bill Murray play the part of Phil Connors, in the movie "Groundhog Day."
His boss sends him to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, eighty miles away, to report on the town's annual Groundhog Day celebration, set for February 2.
He asks someone what day it is and learns that it is February 2, Groundhog Day.
It is again February 2, Groundhog Day.
"Groundhog Day," was first released on February 4, 1993, thirty years ago this week, and to celebrate its anniversary, movie officials plan to release the film this month in select theaters.
