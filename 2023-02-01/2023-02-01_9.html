     Alec Baldwin scheduled for court on charges in set death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA FE, N.M. — (AP) — Alec Baldwin’s first court appearance has been set as he confronts accusations of firearm safety failures and involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on a New Mexico film set.
Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.
In newly filed court documents, prosecutors said reckless safety failures accompanied the film production from the outset.
Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun – or anywhere on the movie set,” the statement said.
She also highlighted Baldwin as the person "that held the gun, that pointed the gun and that pulled the trigger."

     Involuntary manslaughter charges formally filed against Alec Baldwin in 'Rust' shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The filing detailed several reasons for the charges, including prosecutors saying that Baldwin’s interviews with media and law enforcement were inconsistent.
“Her absence from the set allowed the reckless behavior to happen and continue, resulting in the fatal shooting,” Shilling wrote.
Should the case go to trial, a jury would have to decide under which definition of involuntary manslaughter Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed were guilty.
No charges will be filed in the shooting of Souza, the district attorney’s office said.
Hutchins’ family settled its wrongful death lawsuit against the film’s producers, including Baldwin and Rust Movie Productions, LLC, in October.
