     Punxsutawney Phil prepares to make Groundhog Day prediction

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to folklore, if he sees his shadow there will be six more weeks of winter.
The annual event in Punxsutawney originated from a German legend about a furry rodent.
According to records dating back to 1887, Phil has predicted winter more than 100 times.
While Punxsutawney Phil may be the most famous groundhog seer, he’s certainly not the only one.
New York City’s Staten Island Chuck will also make his prediction Thursday during an event at the Staten Island Zoo.

     Summary: Thursday is Groundhog Day; but just how accurate is Phil?
Published 2:00 pm Wednesday, February 1, 2023Thursday, Feb. 2 is Groundhog Day.
The official groundhog prognosticator is known as Punxsutawney Phil, since the town of the same name is home to the furry forecasting creature.
According to the official website of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, there has only ever been one, immortal, Punxsutawney Phil.
So Thursday morning, let Phil — or the Inner Circle, or your local meteorologist — predict the weather for you.

     Summary: Okay, we can all admit that Groundhog Day is a bit of a funny holiday.
😂For everyone hoping to tune in, we've gathered all the information you need to know about Groundhog Day 2023, when it is, and the tradition's history.
Sorry, but first, we must also address a more dire question—is it Groundhog Day or Groundhogs Day?
What is Groundhog Day?
It's believed that Groundhogs Day came from two older traditions, Imbolc and Candlemas Day.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For those who were unaware of Groundhog Day, the 1993 movie by the same name starring Bill Murray made people far and wide familiar with the annual tradition.
Punxsutawney Phil, the other star of the movie, is the most famous groundhog forecaster, but how does he, and his peers, foresee the weather to come?
The Groundhog Day prediction depends on seeing a shadowGroundhogs fatten themselves up in the fall before they lay down for a long winter’s sleep.
In the case of Groundhog Day, they’re given a little nudge to wake up.
But over his 135 years in the weather forecasting business, Punxsutawney Phil has been subpar in his predictions according to NOAA.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Feeling a tad “been there/done that,” I was reminded that Groundhog Day was approaching and that I know very little about it.
“What’s the story behind Groundhog Day?” I tippy-tapped, having only a rudimentary knowledge of the bogus holiday.
Perhaps I should propose a Groundhog Day celebration in Sullivan County next year.
Fun Fact: “Groundhog Day” is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott.
Murray portrays Phil Connors, a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, PA, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

     The bizarre history of Groundhog Day and Punxsutawney Phil
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Every year, Americans in snowy states wait with bated breath to see whether Punxsutawney Phil will spot his shadow.
Every February 2, the members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club trek to Gobbler’s Knob, Punxsutawney Phil’s official home just outside of town.
While May 1 became May Day, and November 1 became All Saints’ Day, the February 1 holiday was pushed to the following day – and would eventually become Groundhog Day.
The phrase “groundhog day” even became shorthand for that déjà vu feeling of reliving the same day over and over.
Last year, the apparently immortal and married groundhog Punxsutawney Phil predicted six more weeks of winter.
