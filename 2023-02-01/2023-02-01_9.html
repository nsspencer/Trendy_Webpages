     Fed Raises Rates as Expected. Chairman Powell Leaves Hope for Cuts.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Federal Reserve may be slowing its pace of monetary-policy tightening, but it doesn’t see itself stopping any time soon.
Markets, however, are thinking otherwise.
The central bank voted unanimously on Wednesday to lift interest rates by another quarter of a percentage point, marking the eighth increase in the past year and bringing the target for the federal funds rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%.
The widely expected move to downshift to a 25 basis-point rise reflects the progress the Fed has made so far in tackling price growth, which has slowed steadily since the summer.

     S&amp;P 500 closes higher on Wednesday, Nasdaq adds 2% as investors look past Fed's rate hike
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.05% to end at 4,119.21, reversing an earlier decline of almost 1%.
The Nasdaq Composite added 2% to close at 11,816.32, boosted by gains in chipmakers following strong earnings from Advanced Micro Devices .
Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.92 points, or 0.02% to 34,092.96 — after sliding more than 500 points at the day's lows.
The Fed's latest hike represented a slowing from its half-point increase in December, giving a nod to investors hoping the central bank would ease off its aggressive tightening campaign.
The S&amp;P 500 capped its best January performance since 2019, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite notched its strongest January in 22 years.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today's Fed meeting statement reiterated policymakers' plan for "ongoing increases" in the U.S. central bank's key interest rate.
March Fed Meeting ExpectationsAfter the Fed meeting, markets were still betting that the Fed will pause rate hikes after next month, with the key overnight lending rate at a range of 4.75% to 5%.
Economists pay close attention to wage growth for private-sector workers, excluding those in incentive-paid occupations, as a good indicator of underlying wage growth.
S&amp;P 500 Set-UpIn Wednesday afternoon stock market action, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.1%, having traded lower before the Fed meeting ended.
On Friday's the S&amp;P 500 crested around 4094, making a third run at clearing 4100 since the start of December.

     Fed approves smallest rate hike since March, in nod to improved inflation outlook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The decision, at the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee’s first meeting of 2023, comes after months of jumbo-sized rate increases intended to cool the economy, and marks the return to a more traditional interest-rate policy.
Fed officials nodded towards those trends in its statement on Wednesday, writing that “inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated.”And while Fed officials are slowing rate hikes after months of unusually aggressive action, the central bank is far from declaring victory.
Wednesday’s statement included language that made it clear policymakers expect that more hikes will be necessary to temper inflation.
While those trends could make the case for slowing rate hikes after months of unusually aggressive action, the central bank is far from declaring victory.
Senior Fed officials like Vice Chair Lael Brainard and Governor Christopher Waller have in recent weeks stressed the need to see six months of positive data before they stop hiking rates.
