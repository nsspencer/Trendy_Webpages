Punxsutawney Phil will make his prediction Thursday morning at Gobbler’s Knob.
In 2021, The Inner Circle had to close off Gobbler’s Knob to protect Punxsutawney Phil from COVID-19.
The festivities really exploded worldwide after the release of ‘Groundhog Day’ starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell in 1993.

     Summary: Groundhog Day was the natural candidate.
One of the more questionable elements of Groundhog Day … Andie Macdowell and Bill Murray fall in love.
Watching Groundhog Day every day for a year provided me with a deeper appreciation for how a film may contain multitudes – particularly those we choose to willingly re-experience.
The legacy of Groundhog Day can be seen in the recurring appeal of the time-loop narrative in TV shows and films such as Palm Springs, Russian Doll and Happy Death Day.
On reaching the finish line I was elated and celebrated with a final viewing on the big screen.

     ‘Groundhog Day’ Hits 30: Comedy’s Team on “Tense” Shoot, Bill Murray Tapping Into “Dark Side”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bill Murray in 'Groundhog Day.'
When director Harold Ramis and producing partner Trevor Albert stumbled upon the screenplay for Groundhog Day, no one knew it would become a film that viewers would (voluntarily) watch over and over.
Having followed National Lampoon’s Vacation with 1986’s underperforming Club Paradise, Ramis wanted his next project to aim outside the box.
Ultimately, the role went to Bill Murray, Ramis’ longtime collaborator on such films as Caddyshack and Ghostbusters.
“It was a tense shoot for a number of reasons,” says Albert, given the conflicts between the pair.

     Groundhog Day: A necessary holiday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Groundhog Day is a holiday centered on one simple question: Will the groundhog see his or her shadow Thursday morning?
Like a lot of our holidays, Groundhog Day began with the pagans.
In 1886, the Punxsutawney (Pa.) Spirit newspaper printed the first news of a Groundhog Day observance.
The next year, the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club celebrated for the first time at Gobbler’s Knob, and the newspaper’s editor declared Phil was America’s official weather-forecasting groundhog.
“He is very clairvoyant, even after life,” naturalist Liz Alvey said of Bob, who made his Groundhog Day debut in 2021.

     Summary: When it comes to Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney Phil isn’t the only furry critter that makes predictions about how much longer we have until winter ends and spring arrives.
Just a reminder: Folklore says if the groundhogs see their shadows on Groundhog Day, there will be another six weeks of winter.
A Sussex County groundhog named Stonewall Jackson VI emerged from his burrow amid the snow and did not see his shadow on Groundhog Day 2022.
Staten Island Chuck is pictured with a cookie at the Staten Island Zoo as he geared up for Groundhog Day in 2016.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Every year, Americans in snowy states wait with bated breath to see whether Punxsutawney Phil will spot his shadow.
Every February 2, the members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club trek to Gobbler’s Knob, Punxsutawney Phil’s official home just outside of town.
While May 1 became May Day, and November 1 became All Saints’ Day, the February 1 holiday was pushed to the following day – and would eventually become Groundhog Day.
The phrase “groundhog day” even became shorthand for that déjà vu feeling of reliving the same day over and over.
Last year, the apparently immortal and married groundhog Punxsutawney Phil predicted six more weeks of winter.

     Summary: How did Groundhog Day start?
Groundhog Day appears to have European roots.
This fits the folklore and the timing of Groundhog Day.
The celebration of Groundhog Day would need to change by latitude in order to perfectly match groundhog emergence.
So for the animals themselves, Groundhog Day is more like Valentine’s Day.
