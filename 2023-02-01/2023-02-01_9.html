     Fed Raises Rates as Expected. More Increases Are Likely on the Way.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, solidifying its shift into a slower pace of monetary-policy tightening while signaling that it still feels it has more work to do to cool rampant inflation.
The move, which was in line with expectations, marks the eighth time the Fed has lifted interest rates in the past year.
It brings the bank’s target for the federal funds rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%.

     S&amp;P 500 gains on Wednesday as investors shake off Fed’s latest rate hike, bet on falling inflation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The S&amp;P 500 gained 1%, reversing an early decline of almost 1%.
The Nasdaq Composite added 2%, boosted by gains in chipmakers following strong earnings from Advanced Micro Devices .
Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed, after sliding more than 500 points at the day's lows.
The Fed's latest hike represented a slowing from its half-point increase in December, giving a nod to investors hoping the central bank would ease off its aggressive tightening campaign.
The S&amp;P 500 capped its best January performance since 2019, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite notched its strongest January in 22 years.

     Fed approves smallest rate hike since March, in nod to improved inflation outlook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The decision, at the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee’s first meeting of 2023, comes after months of jumbo-sized rate increases intended to cool the economy, and marks the return to a more traditional interest-rate policy.
Fed officials nodded towards those trends in a post-meeting statement on Wednesday, writing that “inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated.”And while Fed officials are slowing rate hikes after months of unusually aggressive action, the central bank is far from declaring victory.
The extent of these “future increases,” they said will depend on a number of economic and financial factors.
While those trends could make the case for slowing rate hikes after months of unusually aggressive action, the central bank is far from declaring victory.
Senior Fed officials like Vice Chair Lael Brainard and Governor Christopher Waller have in recent weeks stressed the need to see six months of positive data before they stop hiking rates.
