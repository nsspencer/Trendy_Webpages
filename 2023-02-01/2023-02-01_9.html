     Robert Williams III ‘Huge Key’ To Celtics’ Offensive Success
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s one guy, however, who has garnered praise to the level of Tatum and Brown throughout Boston’s most successful stretches.
Robert Williams III has played just 18 games this season, spending two months on the shelf recovering from knee surgery.
Since he’s played in the least amount of games among Celtics not on a two-way contract, his impact has been amplified in games where Boston is able to play at full strength.
He sealed, he created gaps, he created small two-on-one’s and did a great job against smaller guys on the offensive glass.
The 25-year-old scored 16 points and collected nine rebounds (five offensive) against a shorthanded quad, opening up the offense through doing things he’s comfortable with.

     Celtics vs. Nets takeaways: C's rain 3s, set franchise records in blowout win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First, here are our takeaways from the C's dominant win over the Nets, which brings them to 37-15 on the season.
It marked the first time in franchise history the Celtics outscored their opponent by 30 points in the first quarter.
Given Williams' history, it's worrisome anytime the big man's name pops up on the injury report.
They became the first teammates in C's history to make seven 3s in the same game.
Derrick White (14 points, 10 rebounds), Malcolm Brogdon (10 points, 4 assists), Sam Hauser (8 points, 5 rebounds), and Grant Williams (6 points, 2 rebounds) each had two 3s.
