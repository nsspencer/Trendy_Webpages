     Summary: Disney+ confirms where Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline.
According to Disney+, Black Panther 2 is set between Moon Knight and She-Hulk: Attorney At Law in the MCU timeline.
Related: MCU Phase 5 May Already Have A Timeline ProblemDisney+'s MCU Timeline Gets Wakanda Forever Right (But Is Still Wrong)The placement of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a somewhat rare win for Disney+.
The Disney+ MCU timeline might be right about Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's placement in relation to coming after Moon Knight and before She-Hulk, but the overall MCU chronological timeline is wrong.
With Marvel Studios planning to release an official MCU timeline book later this year, hopefully more details will be revealed to help fix the Disney+ timeline.

     Disney+ Reveals New MCU Timeline Order With Black Panther: Wakanda Forever

     Summary: In celebration of its Disney+ premiere, it was revealed that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has an unexpected placement in the MCU's timeline.
The sequel paid tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman while also moving the story forward by introducing Shuri as the next Black Panther.
Per Disney+, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever takes place between Moon Knight and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, serving as the 39th entry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) timeline.
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's place in the MCU timeline means many significant events are concurrently happening in the wider universe aside from Wakanda and Talokan's war.

     'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' Finally Hit Disney Plus: What to Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Black Panther: Wakanda Forever took longer to start streaming on Disney Plus than any other Marvel movie in the pandemic era.
Is Black Panther: Wakanda Forever streaming?
The movie became available to stream on Disney Plus early Wednesday morning, starting at 12:01 a.m. PT/3:01 a.m.
How long will it take for Disney Plus to stream Marvel's next movies?
However, Wakanda Forever may have been held off Disney Plus so long because of a consideration that won't apply to the next Marvel films coming out this year: With a Black director and predominantly Black cast, Wakanda Forever is debuting on Disney Plus on the first day of Black History Month.

     Wakanda Forever’s Ironheart Could Set Up Shang-Chi 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wakanda Forever has a throwaway line that sets up Demetrius this, with Riri saying her red muscle car was left to her by her dad.
Wakanda Forever established a bond between Riri, Shuri (Wright), and Okoye (Danai Gurira), so apart from the pretty fanciful Wellspring, none of this is much of a reach for Ironheart or Shang-Chi 2.
Then again, tacking Riri’s story onto the latter would only reignite complaints she was shoehorned into Wakanda Forever.
The MCU’s Ten Rings organization dates back to 2008’s Iron Man and was a divisive background group up until Shang-Chi.
There was the maligned Mandarin twist of Iron Man 3, while a scene involving a mysterious member was cut from Ant-Man.

     6 Ways Wakanda Forever Sets Up Black Panther 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Black Panther: Wakanda Forever perfectly sets the stage for Black Panther 3 in the MCU.
Related: Doctor Doom In Black Panther 3 Would Continue The Franchise's Best TrickSCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY6 Shuri Will Return As Black Panther In Black Panther 3One of the biggest plot points during Black Panther: Wakanda Forever was Shuri's attempts to create a synthetic heart-shaped herb, which would allow the Black Panther to return to Wakanda after T'Challa's death, and Killmonger's destruction of the heart-shaped herbs in Black Panther.
It's not clear who would take her place as the MCU's Black Panther should she give it up, but Black Panther 3 will surely see her donning the vibranium suit as the Black Panther, at least for a little while.
This story would certainly be in keeping with Coogler's big swings during the Black Panther films and would be a great payoff for many who wished to see Victor Von Doom introduced in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.
Ryan Coogler has many avenues that he could follow with the story for Black Panther 3, helped by some emotional and intense storylines that have started to grow in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.
