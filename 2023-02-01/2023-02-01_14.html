     Here's exactly how Netflix will prevent you from password sharing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We knew it was coming, and we knew it was coming soon: Sharing Netflix passwords outside of your household is about to become a lot harder.
But we had no idea how, exactly, Netflix plans to prevent people from sharing their passwords – until now.
But if you're away for an "extended period of time" — presumably, more than 31 days — Netflix says that "your device may be blocked from watching Netflix."
The solution to this is requesting a "temporary access code to continue watching," Netflix says.
For example, I primarily watch Netflix on my smart TV, but I'm logged in on a variety of other devices, such as phones and tablets.

     Netflix hasn’t confirmed its plans to stop password sharing just yet
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Based on info sourced from Netflix’s support pages, The Streamable reported on Tuesday details about its upcoming anti-password sharing efforts.
But now Netflix tells The Verge it hasn’t confirmed what its setup could look like for US streaming subscribers.
We already know that Netflix is planning to roll out password sharing more broadly within the coming months.
In its report, The Streamable cites this Netflix help center page as the source for its information.
Similarly, the currently available US support page about what Netflix considers a “household” is vastly different from the pages in Costa Rica, Chile, and Peru.

     Netflix Password Sharing Crackdown Means You Must ‘Check In’ At Home Once A Month
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Courtesy of Netflix © 2022 Courtesy of NetflixNew details are emerging about how Netflix plans to enforce its upcoming global crackdown on password sharing, which right now is live in just a few countries including Chile, Costa Rica and Peru.
One constant question through all this is how Netflix is going to prove who is account sharing and who is just traveling or staying in a second household.
I’m sure that’s an easy process…Netflix claims 100 million people are password sharing on Netflix, and they want to convert at least some portion of those into active users with their own accounts or add-ons to existing ones.
And a lot of annoyed customers who get frustrated with Netflix if X or Y device is blocked in X or Y location and they have to call Netflix tech support to sort it out.
You may see all streaming services start to adopt this, as while they may not be saying it publicly like Netflix, none of them want people password sharing fundamentally.

     Netflix's New Password Sharing Rules (and How to Get Around Them)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You’ve probably heard about the company’s plans to crack down on this sharing, and even talk that it’ll charge per extra user.
How Netflix plans to limit password sharingIn short, Netflix’s new policy is this: “A Netflix account is for people who live together in a single household,” like something out of a B ible verse.
It’s a departure from the password sharing model we’ve heard up until now, where Netflix would charge a certain amount for each user accessing an account from outside the household.
In Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru, Netflix requires you to sign into Netflix on the household wifi once every 31 days.
Otherwise, that device will be blocked from the service until it reconnects to the household wifi.

     Netflix reveals first details of password sharing crackdown
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix (NFLX) has revealed the first details of its password sharing crackdown.
As a result, Netflix will require users to identify a "primary location" for all accounts that live within the same household.
Netflix warned in the its quarterly letter to shareholders it will be intensifying its push to combat password sharing.
Today’s widespread account sharing (100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as build our business," the company said.
Coupled with a crackdown on password sharing, Netflix will also rely on its newly launched ad-supported tier to lift profitability, especially as competition within the streaming space escalates: "As always, our north stars remain pleasing our members and building even greater profitability over time."
