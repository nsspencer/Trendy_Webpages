     Meta Results Are Mixed But the Stock Is Soaring on Expense Cuts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meta Platforms shares spiked in late trading Wednesday after the company disclosed fourth quarter financial results and announced a new round of cuts to its 2023 spending plan.
In another shareholder friendly move, the Facebook parent is taking a more aggressive approach to buying back stock.
The company said it bought back $6.91 billion of stock in the latest quarter, bringing the full year total to $27.93 billion.
The company said its board approved a new $40 billion buyback authorization, in addition to $10.87 billion remaining on its previous repurchase program.

     Meta stock perks up as the company promises a ‘year of efficiency’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The company beat revenue expectations in the final quarter of 2022, bringing in $32.2 billion.
Those gains combined with Meta’s aggressive cuts and its promise of an efficient 2023 drove stock prices up around 15% in trading after-hours.
Meta took a notable beating in 2022’s market turndown, losing as much as 60% of its value over the course of the year.
“Our management theme for 2023 is the ‘Year of Efficiency’ and we’re focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization,” Zuckerberg said.
In the call, Meta’s chief executive called out Instagram Reels and the company’s algorithmic recommendation engine as two major areas of focus in the coming months.

The company reported 2 billion daily active users—an increase of 4% year-over-year and more than the 1.99 billion expected.
Meta’s stock plummeted last year as CEO Mark Zuckerberg prioritized the company’s focus on the metaverse, which he has repeatedly billed as a revolutionary, immersive online experience.
TangentMeta announced last week it was reinstating former President Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts, which were banned for two years following the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.

     Meta stock soars following revenue beat, positive outlook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares for Facebook parent Meta jumped more than 17% in after-hours trading Wednesday, after the tech giant beat Wall Street expectations on revenue and user growth.
Of note: Meta also provided positive first quarter guidance and said it expects expenses for the full year to be lower than originally forecasted.
Why it matters: Investors no longer expect Meta to grow at the same blockbuster pace that it used to.
Be smart: The company's optimistic projections for its first quarter revenue are an important update considering Meta competitor Snap Inc. on Tuesday told investors that it expects revenue to decline 2%-10% in the same time period.
The big picture: Wednesday's earnings end a year-long losing streak on Wall Street for the company.

     Meta Stock Is Getting Its Mojo Back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite the earnings miss, in after hours trading, Meta stock soared 20%, erasing more than six months of losses from the stock, and returning Meta shares to prices last seen in June 2022.
All of this means that, after missing earnings in Q4 2022, Meta is most likely going to outperform earnings expectations all through 2023.
Commenting on the results, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian declared unqualifiedly that “Meta [is] getting its mojo back,” “increasing expense discipline,” and “making improvements with both users and advertisers.” After praising Meta’s performance in Q4 2022 and predicting great things for 2023, Sebastian proceeded to reiterate an “outperform” rating on Meta stock.
Because promises of efficiency notwithstanding, the simple fact is that as of Q4 2022, at least, Meta is still on a downtrend.

     Meta’s Stock Spikes After Q4 Report, But Its Results Are A Mixed Bag
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But shares soared by more than 30% in after-hours trading on Wednesday following Meta’s Q4 2022 earnings report, which beat the street’s revenue expectations.
Although that is not to say that Meta grew its revenue, either overall or on a quarterly YoY basis.
Meta’s total revenue for 2022 was $116.6 billion, down 1% YoY.
(Ad revenue for Q4 was $31.3 billion, also down 4% from the year ago quarter.)
“There is still certainly an absolute headwind to our revenue numbers,” said Susan Li, Meta’s newly appointed CFO.
