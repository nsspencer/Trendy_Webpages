     BBC Pushing On With ‘The Osbournes’ Reboot Despite Ozzy Tour Retirement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EXCLUSIVE: The BBC reboot of MTV’s The Osbournes is going ahead as planned following the news that Ozzy Osbourne will likely retire from touring.
A BBC spokeswoman confirmed to Deadline that the pubcaster is continuing with Home to Roost, which will follow the Osbournes as they celebrate Sharon Osbourne’s 70th birthday and daughter Kelly Osbourne’s soon-to-be-born baby having returned to the UK.
The original MTV version of The Osbournes ran from 2002 to 2005 and became a cult classic.
At the time, he said that the degenerative condition was the least of his issues, citing “unbelievable pain” stemming from a prior injury.
He had the year before suffered a fall that damaged his spine and required surgery.

     Ozzy Osbourne Retires From Touring After Ongoing Spinal Injury: ‘My Body Is Still Physically Weak’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, the remaining tour dates, scheduled for May 2023, have been scrapped completely as the Prince of Darkness announces his retirement from touring.
“This is probably one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to share with my loyal fans,” Osbourne wrote in a statement shared across his social accounts.
But he soon changed his mind and was back on the road within three years for the Retirement Sucks tour.
Then, in early 2003, the musician was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, further complicating his ongoing health problems.
And with that, his decades-long journey as a touring musician now comes to an end.

     Ozzy Osbourne cancels 2023 European tour dates, cites injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hard rock legend Ozzy Osbourne announced the cancellation of his 2023 tour dates in the U.K. and continental Europe.
“Never would I have imagined that my touring days would have ended this way," Osbourne said.
Osbourne previously cancelled tour dates in Europe and North America in 2019 due to health problems, including a "bad fall" in which he said he injured vertebrae in his neck.
The singer, who enjoyed solo success after leaving Black Sabbath, announced in 2020 that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, a nervous system disorder that affects movement.
Osbourne and the other three members of Black Sabbath were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.
