    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Celtics’ domination over Kyrie Irving and the Brooklyn Nets hit new heights Wednesday night at TD Garden, as the Celtics went wire-to-wire over Brooklyn and at one point led by 49 points in what finished as a 43-point destruction of the Nets and Boston’s 10th straight victory over the Nets.
“I just thought we got off to a great start,” Celtics interim coach Joe Mazzulla said following the victory.
“We chose to be aggressive on both ends of the floor, and we weren’t reactive, we were proactive in our approach to both ends.
That mindset kind of started it for us.”

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Factor in the rest of Tatum's Celtics roster, and Brooklyn was utterly eviscerated.
After 12 minutes of play, the Celtics led the Nets 46-16.
It was the biggest first-quarter lead in Celtics history, and the second-worst quarter ever played by the Nets, and you'll be stunned to hear that things didn't get much better from there.
Despite their enormous lead, the Celtics managed to win each of the four quarters.
If you include the playoffs, the Celtics have now beaten the Nets 10 times in a row.

     Robert Williams III ‘Huge Key’ To Celtics’ Offensive Success
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — Trying to divvy up credit through the Celtics’ historic start hasn’t been an easy task.
There’s one guy, however, who has garnered praise to the level of Tatum and Brown throughout Boston’s most successful stretches.
Robert Williams III has played just 18 games this season, spending two months on the shelf recovering from offseason knee surgery.
Since he’s played in the least amount of games among Celtics regulars, his impact has been amplified in games where Boston plays at full strength.
He sealed, he created gaps, he created small two-on-ones and did a great job against smaller guys on the offensive glass.
