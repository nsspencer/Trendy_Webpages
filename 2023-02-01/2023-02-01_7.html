     Prosecutors claim Alec Baldwin skipped firearm safety sessions and was distracted by family on set of Rust
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alec Baldwin missed mandatory firearms training before filming began on Rust and was distracted by his family on set, according to court filings.
Prosecutors in New Mexico filed formal charges of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin, 64, and armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed over the death of Halyna Hutchins on Tuesday.
“Baldwin’s deviation from known standards, practices and protocol directly caused the fatal death of Hutchins,” Mr Shilling added.
Prosecutors have filed two charges of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin, as both an actor and a producer.

     Why Alec Baldwin May Be Facing Way Less Jail Time Than You Think
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When prosecutors formerly charged actor Alec Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter in the deadly “Rust” shooting, they released reams of paperwork detailing the evidence supporting those charges.
They also revealed the charging documents, which show that the firearm enhancement statute that hangs the heaviest sentence over the celebrity’s head probably stands on shaky ground.
“So I don’t think that that penalty is likely to be imposed,” said Epner, referring to the 5-year enhancement.
“I would never point a gun at anyone and pull a trigger at them,” Baldwin told George Stephanopoulos.
On day one of my instruction in this business, people said to me, ‘Never take a gun and go click, click, click, click, click.’ Because even though it’s incremental, you damage the firing pin on the gun if you do that.

     Alec Baldwin scheduled for court on charges in set death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SANTA FE, N.M. — (AP) — Alec Baldwin’s first court appearance has been set as he confronts accusations of firearm safety failures and involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on a New Mexico film set.
Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.
In newly filed court documents, prosecutors said reckless safety failures accompanied the film production from the outset.
Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun – or anywhere on the movie set,” the statement said.
She also highlighted Baldwin as the person "that held the gun, that pointed the gun and that pulled the trigger."
