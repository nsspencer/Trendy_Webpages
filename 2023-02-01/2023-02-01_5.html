     Groundhog Day 2023 weather prediction: What does it mean if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We’re about to hear from everyone’s favorite four-legged weather forecaster, Punxsutawney Phil.
According to legend, if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter weather.
The event dates back to 1886 when a group of groundhog hunters from Punxsutawney dubbed themselves “The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club” and began promoting Phil was the nations’ only weather prognosticating groundhog.
More on Phil…According to Groundhog Club members, there has only been one Phil and he has been predicting since 1887, making him 135 years old.
His longevity is credited to drinking “the elixir of life,” a secret recipe known to club members.
