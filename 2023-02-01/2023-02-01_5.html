     What Is Black History Month?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Black History Month, also known as African American History Month, is a month-long recognition of African Americans and the critical role they played in the founding and shaping of the United States of America.
In the 1960’s as the civil rights movement grew “Negro Week” became Black History Month across many college and university campuses.
In 1976 President Gerald Ford became the first leader of the United States of America to officially recognize Black History Month.
Since being recognized as an official heritage month, Black History Month has been assigned a theme for each year of its celebration.
This year’s theme, Black Resistance, will honor those whose resistance led to justice and freedom for Black Americans.

     It's Black History Month. Here are 3 things to know about the annual celebration
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's Black History Month.
Here are three things to know about Black History Month:It was Negro History Week before it was Black History MonthIn 1926, Carter G. Woodson, the scholar often referred to as the "father of Black history," established Negro History Week to focus attention on Black contributions to civilization.
Across the country, public schools "created all these courses and mandates for Black history," unofficially creating a Black History Month, King says.
Today, Black History Month is also celebrated in Canada every February and the United Kingdom in October.
However, Black History Month has been and can continue to be a force for better understanding.

     Brands, Don't Make These Mistakes During Black History Month
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Corporate efforts to observe Black History Month are often cringe-worthy at best and offensive at worst.
Don't: Pander to your employees and customers this Black History MonthIn the Year of Our Lord 2023, we should really all be past the platitudinous "Happy Black History Month" email to employees — or worse, the dreaded product drop.
"It is basically commodifying the Black American experience by those who do not share those experiences and who have benefitted from the enslavement of people.”The same holds true for brands that seek to capitalize on Black History Month while doing little to honor Black history or benefit Black communities.
"Just like Pride Month, Black History Month has become a routine time of year when corporations say the absolute most while doing the least for marginalized communities," he wrote in a 2021 op/ed for the Washington Post.
Think of your team's well-being, and don't repeat the ugly cycle this Black History Month.
