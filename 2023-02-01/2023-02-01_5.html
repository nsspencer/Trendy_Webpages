    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hard rock legend Ozzy Osbourne announced the cancellation of his 2023 tour dates in the U.K. and continental Europe.
“Never would I have imagined that my touring days would have ended this way," Osbourne said.

Osbourne and the other three members of Black Sabbath were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.

     Ozzy Osbourne Retires From Touring After Ongoing Spinal Injury: ‘My Body Is Still Physically Weak’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, the remaining tour dates, scheduled for May 2023, have been scrapped completely as the Prince of Darkness announces his retirement from touring.
“This is probably one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to share with my loyal fans,” Osbourne wrote in a statement shared across his social accounts.
But he soon changed his mind and was back on the road within three years for the Retirement Sucks tour.
Then, in early 2003, the musician was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, further complicating his ongoing health problems.
And with that, his decades-long journey as a touring musician now comes to an end.

     Ozzy Osbourne Can No Longer Tour Following Spinal Injury
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: tour dates, “as I know I couldn’t deal with the travel required.”He continues: “Never would I have imagined that my touring days would have ended this way.
Though it’s the end of the road for the legendary British rocker, he hasn’t ruled out performing, so long as travel isn’t required.
“My team is currently coming up with ideas for where I will be able to perform without having to travel from city to city and country to country.”Ozzy has soldiered on for years.
His injury dates back to 2019, when the singer, who is also battling Parkinson’s disease, had surgery to repair an older injury he sustained during a 2003 ATV accident.
Last year, he went under the knife for a vitally important procedure that wife/manager Sharon Osbourne said could determine his future.
