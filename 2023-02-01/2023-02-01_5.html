     Samsung's newest Galaxy S smartphones a test of brand power in weak market
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [1/7] Samsung Electronics' flagship smartphone Galaxy S23 is seen on display at an unveiling ceremony in Seoul, South Korea, January 30, 2023.
Analysts said the Galaxy S23 smartphone series, with its cameras and faster chips than its predecessor, could still face weak demand as consumers spend less amid surging inflation in a struggling global economy.
It is Samsung's first-ever 200-megapixel camera sensor, and the series uses Qualcomm Inc's (QCOM.O) Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile processor.
Qualcomm said that with the S23 series, 100% of the processors used will be from Qualcomm.
In the United States, the base Galaxy S23 will be priced from $799 and two higher-specification versions, the S23 Plus and S23 Ultra, from $999 and $1,199, respectively.

     Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360: hands-on &amp; how to pre-order
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Galaxy Book series has consistently impressed us with its range of slim, attractive and versatile designs, so it’s no surprise that Samsung isn’t reinventing the wheel for the Galaxy Book 3 range — though it is bringing a powerful new member to the family.
This year’s lineup consists of the Galaxy Book 3 Pro, the convertible Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360 and the debuting Galaxy Book 3 Ultra, the latter of which features the highest end Intel and Nvidia chipsets for serious productivity and immersive PC gaming.
Galaxy Book 3 price and preordersAll three Galaxy Book 3 models are available for preorder now, and will ship on Feb. 17.
The 16-inch Book 3 Pro 360 starts at $1,900 in the same colors, while the 16-inch Book 3 Ultra will run you at least $2,400 and comes only in Graphite.
Slim looks, big power and cross-device functionalityMike Andronico/CNNI spent the majority of my hands-on time with the Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360, a mouthful of a laptop that improves on the Book 2 Pro 360 we really dug last year (seriously, Samsung needs to streamline these names).
