The Galaxy S23 series isn't the lone hardware announcement from the company.
New PhonesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuSamsung's Galaxy S23 smartphones follow closely in the footsteps of the S22 series.
The S23 Ultra, in particular, looks nearly identical to the S22 Ultra.
And since the edges of the Ultra's screen are flatter, you get a slightly larger surface to doodle on.

     Samsung's newest Galaxy S smartphones a test of brand power in weak market
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [1/7] Samsung Electronics' flagship smartphone Galaxy S23 is seen on display at an unveiling ceremony in Seoul, South Korea, January 30, 2023.
Analysts said the Galaxy S23 smartphone series, with its cameras and faster chips than its predecessor, could still face weak demand as consumers spend less amid surging inflation in a struggling global economy.
It is Samsung's first-ever 200-megapixel camera sensor, and the series uses Qualcomm Inc's (QCOM.O) Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile processor.
Qualcomm said that with the S23 series, 100% of the processors used will be from Qualcomm.
In the United States, the base Galaxy S23 will be priced from $799 and two higher-specification versions, the S23 Plus and S23 Ultra, from $999 and $1,199, respectively.

There are, fittingly, three primary SKUs for the Galaxy Book 3:Galaxy Book 3 Pro (14- and 16-inch), which starts at $1,500Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360 (16-inch), which starts at $1,900Galaxy Book 3 Ultra (16-inch), which starts at $2,400Top level, the Pro 3 is the thinnest of the bunch, the Pro 360 is a swiveling convertible (PC/tablet) with S Pen functionality and the Ultra, as one would surmise, is the highest end of the trio.
The Pro 360, meanwhile, is the only one of the bunch that sports a touch screen (with stylus functionality).
The Ultra starts with 16 GB of RAM (up to 32 GB) and 512 GB of storage (up to 1 TB).
The Pro and Pro 360 will start shipping February 17.

     Summary: The S23 Ultra seems like a conservative upgrade on the surface, cramming a faster processor and some quality-of-life updates into a familiar design.
Here’s what we think about the Galaxy S23 Ultra after getting our hands on one for a few hours.
Galaxy S23 Ultra price and preordersThe Galaxy S23 Ultra is available for preorder now starting at $1,200 with 256GB of storage and in your choice of Phantom Black, Cream, Green or Lavender, with units set to ship on Feb. 17.
Same slick design with a crazy new cameraMike Andronico/CNNWe wouldn’t blame you for mistaking the Galaxy S23 Ultra for last year’s model at a quick glance.
Just like its predecessor, the S23 Ultra feels great to hold, with flat edges that give it some extra grip over the curvier S23 and S23+.

     Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360: hands-on &amp; how to pre-order
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Galaxy Book series has consistently impressed us with its range of slim, attractive and versatile designs, so it’s no surprise that Samsung isn’t reinventing the wheel for the Galaxy Book 3 range — though it is bringing a powerful new member to the family.
This year’s lineup consists of the Galaxy Book 3 Pro, the convertible Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360 and the debuting Galaxy Book 3 Ultra, the latter of which features the highest end Intel and Nvidia chipsets for serious productivity and immersive PC gaming.
Galaxy Book 3 price and preordersAll three Galaxy Book 3 models are available for preorder now, and will ship on Feb. 17.
The 16-inch Book 3 Pro 360 starts at $1,900 in the same colors, while the 16-inch Book 3 Ultra will run you at least $2,400 and comes only in Graphite.
Slim looks, big power and cross-device functionalityMike Andronico/CNNI spent the majority of my hands-on time with the Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360, a mouthful of a laptop that improves on the Book 2 Pro 360 we really dug last year (seriously, Samsung needs to streamline these names).
