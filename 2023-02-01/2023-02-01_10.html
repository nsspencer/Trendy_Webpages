     Four takeaways as Celtics dominate Nets 139-96 for 10th straight win over Brooklyn
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — It wasn’t quite the same as their blowout victory over the Nets from last season, but the Celtics still dominated the Nets comfortably.
The victory marks the 10th straight time the C’s have defeated the Nets, including last season’s first-round sweep.
While Boston’s shot-making impressed all night, the Celtics’ defense also held the Nets to 40.9% shooting.
Wednesday’s win was so lopsided it reminded fans of the 28-2 start the Celtics had against the Nets last season in Brooklyn in what was another blowout win.
The Nets’ defense couldn’t hang with the Celtics, and while the visitors made some shots, it wasn’t enough to overcome Boston’s play.
