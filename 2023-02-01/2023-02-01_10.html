     Why 'Toussaint' Is a Perfect Name in Black Panthe 2: Wakanda Forever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Spoiler warning: Please don’t read this if you don’t want any spoilers for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, especially about “Toussaint.” Okay?
When Shuri meets her new nephew in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, she’s delighted to learn his name is Toussaint — a name, she notes, that has great resonance.
The discovery in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever that vibranium belongs not just to Wakanda, but also to the underwater kingdom of Talokan, also feels richly symbolic.
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is now streaming on Disney+.

     Why Queen Ramonda Was Killed Off In Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Queen Ramonda met her demise at the hands of Namor during Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and sad as it was, it played an important narrative role.
Queen Ramonda's death came as a huge surprise to audiences, but was incredibly important to the story of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and will inform the motivation of the MCU's Black Panther going forward.
Related: Wakanda Forever Directly Sets Up 1 New Avengers (Not Shuri's Black Panther)Queen Ramonda's Death Was Necessary For Shuri's Wakanda Forever StoryAfter Boseman's death, Letitia Wright stepped up to assume the role of the main character for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, with Shuri's grief and relationship to her Wakandan heritage and technology being explored more than any other.
Shuri's grief was a key element of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and this was delivered in spades.
It was hinted at the end of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever that M'Baku would become the new King, though a deleted scene for the film has since confirmed that Okoye could become Queen of Wakanda.

     6 Ways Wakanda Forever Sets Up Black Panther 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Black Panther: Wakanda Forever perfectly sets the stage for Black Panther 3 in the MCU.
Related: Doctor Doom In Black Panther 3 Would Continue The Franchise's Best TrickSCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY6 Shuri Will Return As Black Panther In Black Panther 3One of the biggest plot points during Black Panther: Wakanda Forever was Shuri's attempts to create a synthetic heart-shaped herb, which would allow the Black Panther to return to Wakanda after T'Challa's death, and Killmonger's destruction of the heart-shaped herbs in Black Panther.
It's not clear who would take her place as the MCU's Black Panther should she give it up, but Black Panther 3 will surely see her donning the vibranium suit as the Black Panther, at least for a little while.
This story would certainly be in keeping with Coogler's big swings during the Black Panther films and would be a great payoff for many who wished to see Victor Von Doom introduced in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.
Ryan Coogler has many avenues that he could follow with the story for Black Panther 3, helped by some emotional and intense storylines that have started to grow in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.

     Wakanda Forever’s Ironheart Could Set Up Shang-Chi 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wakanda Forever has a throwaway line that sets up Demetrius this, with Riri saying her red muscle car was left to her by her dad.
Wakanda Forever established a bond between Riri, Shuri (Wright), and Okoye (Danai Gurira), so apart from the pretty fanciful Wellspring, none of this is much of a reach for Ironheart or Shang-Chi 2.
Then again, tacking Riri’s story onto the latter would only reignite complaints she was shoehorned into Wakanda Forever.
The MCU’s Ten Rings organization dates back to 2008’s Iron Man and was a divisive background group up until Shang-Chi.
There was the maligned Mandarin twist of Iron Man 3, while a scene involving a mysterious member was cut from Ant-Man.
