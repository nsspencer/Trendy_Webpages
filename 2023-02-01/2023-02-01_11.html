     Summary: Julien Laurens explains why Hakim Ziyech was unable to complete a deadline day move from Chelsea to PSG.
(1:45)Hakim Ziyech will not join Paris Saint-Germain on loan from Chelsea due to late paperwork causing the deal not to be registered by the French football governing body (LFP), sources have told ESPN.
- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)The LFP legal committee met on Wednesday to discuss the registration but decided against approving the loan.
PSG had hoped to bring Ziyech in on loan for the remainder of the season as a replacement for Pablo Sarabia, who left for Wolves last week.
Ziyech joined Chelsea from Ajax in the summer of 2020 in a deal worth up to €44 million but has struggled to hold down a regular first-team place under three different managers.

     Summary: PARIS, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Lionel Messi scored as Paris St Germain stretched their Ligue 1 lead to five points with a 3-1 win at Montpellier after Kylian Mbappe limped off the pitch on Wednesday.
Following a lacklustre first half PSG burst into life after the break with Fabian Ruiz, Messi and Warren Zaire-Emery finding the net to put them on 51 points from 21 games.
Mbappe had a night to forget at La Mosson, having had his spot-kick parried away by Benjamin Lecomte in the eighth minute.
He had to take it again, only for the Montpellier keeper to deny him again.
England Under-21 striker Folarin Balogun bagged a hat-trick to help Stade de Reims beat Lorient 4-2 and move top of the scorers' charts.

     PSG transfer deadline day: Hakim Ziyech loan from Chelsea thwarted by red tape
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris Saint-Germain had agreed to sign Hakim Ziyech on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season, but the move failed due to registration issues.
Ziyech, 29, has fallen down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge while PSG's need for greater creativity has risen since the FIFA 2022 World Cup.
However, communication issues involving Chelsea, PSG, the Premier League and the French Professional Football League (LFP) offices means that this one did not get done.
Keylor Navas did join Nottingham Forest on loan until the end of the season without an option to buy.
PSG enabled that switch with Athletic Club making the signing of Ander Herrera permanent to keep within the loan number limits.
