     Fed slows pace of rate hikes, raises rates a quarter point. What that means for your finances.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Fed hiked its short-term rate by a quarter point on Wednesday.
That's down from the half-point hike in December and the four consecutive three-quarter percentage-point increases before that.
The Federal Reserve whittled down the size of its rate increases again, with a quarter-point hike, on Wednesday.
But the smaller rate hike is unlikely to provide much relief to already squeezed consumers.
The Fed boosted interest rates for an eighth consecutive time, but only by 0.25 percentage point, down from the half-point hike in December and the four consecutive three-quarter percentage-point increases before that.

     Fed raises rates a quarter point, expects 'ongoing' increases
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point and gave little indication it is nearing the end of this hiking cycle.
Aligning with market expectations, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee boosted the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage point.
"Inflation data received over the past three months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases," Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference.
Markets, however, were looking to this week's meeting for signs that the Fed would be ending the rate increases soon.
In 2022, the Fed approved four consecutive 0.75 percentage point moves before going to a smaller 0.5 percentage point increase in December.

     Fed approves 0.25% hike, softening rate increases again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it was raising its short-term borrowing rate another 0.25%, the central bank's second consecutive decision to slow rate increases while extending an effort to cool the economy and dial back inflation.
In a statement, the Federal Reserve said it remains "highly attentive to inflation risks," adding that the benchmark interest rate would require "ongoing increases" to bring inflation down to normal levels.
The Fed matched economist expectations with the 0.25% rate hike on Wednesday.
Consumer prices rose 6.5% over the yearlong period ending in December, which amounts to a significant slowdown from a summer peak but remains more than triple the Fed's target inflation rate of 2%.
Still, most economists expect a recession later this year, as interest rate hikes weigh on the economy, according to a survey released by Bloomberg last week.

     Summary: The Fed raises interest rates by only a quarter-point after inflation dropsEnlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point Wednesday, its eighth increase in less than a year as the central bank continues its crackdown on inflation.
Higher interest rates have begun to have the desired effect.
And inflation had dropped significantly, although prices are still climbing faster than the central bank would like.
Many investors are betting that the central bank will soon start cutting interest rates, despite repeated warnings to the contrary from Fed officials.
Powell argued that it's better to push interest rates too high than to stop short and allow inflation to come roaring back.

     WATCH: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gives update after small rate hike
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve extended its fight against high inflation Wednesday by raising its key interest rate a quarter-point, its eighth hike since March.
And the Fed signaled that even though inflation is easing, it remains high enough to require further rate hikes.
He frequently acknowledged signs that high inflation is slowing.
The U.S. inflation slowdown suggests that the Fed’s rate hikes have started to achieve their goal.
In addition to the Fed, other major central banks are fighting high inflation with their own rate hikes.

     Federal Reserve rate hike: Inflation, subdued growth and more increases
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Fed sees a subdued growth in 2023 “but not a recession”Fed Chair Jerome Powell said most Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members are not anticipating a recession this year.
“Growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year, but there are other factors that need to be considered,” Powell said.
This suggests another 25 basis-point rate hike at its next meeting in March and leaves open the possibility of an additional 25-point hike at the following meeting in May.
Fed officials in December projected boosting their baseline interest rate range to a midpoint of 5.1 percent in 2023, above the range of 4.5 to 4.75 percent set by Wednesday’s rate hike.
The Fed didn’t release an updated SEP at Wednesday’s meeting, but some economists worry that the smaller rate hike means the Fed will have trouble meeting its current projections.
