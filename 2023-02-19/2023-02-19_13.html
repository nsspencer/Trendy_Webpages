     Summary: Richard Petty is the reigning King of NASCAR, but he's frustrated with having a reduced role with his old race team since Jimmie Johnson became a co-owner in November.
The team held that name until 2021, when it merged with GMS Racing to become Petty GMS Motorsports.

     Summary: Both Jimmie Johnson and Richard Petty have achieved this feat.
Not long ago, Jimmie Johnson confirmed his stake in Richard Petty’s team Petty GMS, now known as Legacy Motor Club.
It all started when Jimmie Johnson marked his return to NASCAR after announcing his retirement in 2020.
“His way of running things and my way of running things are probably a little bit different.
While Richard Petty did accept that the team needed a change given the progress in recent years, the timing of his statements is questionable.

     King Richard Petty in pain as Jimmie Johnson invades
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: King Richard Petty in pain as Jimmie Johnson invadesIt’s all about the Daytona 500 in the USA today, and in the background, two legends of the sport – Richard Petty and Jimmie Johnson – are involved in an intriguing saga that transcends NASCAR and a fascinating tale of modern motorsport, worth telling.
Petty may still reign as NASCAR’s King, but with Jimmie Johnson wresting control of Petty’s race team, he is definitively not the boss.
GMS founder Maury Gallagher, chairman of Allegiant Air, purchased Richard Petty Motorsports in 2021 and Petty, whose 200 Cup wins as a driver are a record, served as the frontman.
“When Jimmie came in, it was going to be hard to be Johnson Petty GMS,” Petty said.
He qualified on speed for the Daytona 500, flew with the Thunderbirds and topped the first speed chart at practice.
