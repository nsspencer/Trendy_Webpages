     Summary: “So, Communism?” Joel deadpans.
We’re communists.”Maria openly embraces the fact she’s a communist, but her husband Tommy doesn’t realize it at all.
The “accidental communism” trope this scene highlights is all over post-apocalyptic media.
From Lost dealing with rationing food to Dark’s post-apocalyptic alternate universe, there are plenty of takes on this.
But while communism’s track record is iffy in our world, in a world overrun with Infected there’s no room for the free market.

     'The Last of Us': Gabriel Luna on Building Brotherly Bond with Pedro Pascal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For The Last of Us actors Gabriel Luna and Pedro Pascal it was important to build a real bond together in order to accurately recreate the connection that their characters, Tommy and Joel, share in the original game.
Luna spoke to Newsweek and other publications about creating this bond with his co-star, which they began cultivating long before cameras started rolling on the critically acclaimed series.
The episode sees Luna and Pascal share several emotionally charged scenes with one another, and the actor spoke of how their onscreen bond was forged early through their personal desire to connect and understand each other like brothers.
"So, we already had a good place to start and then we just started our dialogue, started communicating back and forth.
"I think that's the simple things in life that we all love and we take for granted, he believes that we can truly get back to it, that's that's his goal and that's it purpose."

     Summary: Here, Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey served up their finest performances yet, taking on an anticipated scene that recreated one of the game's most famous (and painfully honest) moments: Joel and Ellie's big argument.
(Opens in a new tab)The episode speaks to the fear of loss and grief in a variety of ways.
In an emotionally charged scene (the one we've been waiting for), Joel and Ellie have an argument over loss.
"That scene is perhaps the most famous scene from the game.
Instead, in the game, Joel and Ellie find Tommy and Maria at the hydroelectric plant that's powering it nearby — and they're ambushed soon after reuniting.

     Summary: We're way past the halfway point of The Last of Us, but we've only been given snippets of Ellie's (Bella Ramsey) backstory.
Well, if the trailer for episode 7 is anything to go by, we're in for a look into the past.
Riley is a character featured in The Last of Us DLC, Left Behind, and is being played by Storm Reid.
In the trailer, she reveals to Ellie that's she's joined the Fireflies, the armed resistance against the very institution Ellie is training with.
Riley's only been mentioned in passing by Ellie up until this point, but the trailer features an abandoned mall we've heard about before — Tess (Anna Torv) asks Ellie about it in episode 2, but she evades detail — and an encounter between Ellie, Riley, and what looks like a Bloater.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Last of Us – Episode 6 Recap – ‘Kin’This episode was written by Craig Mazin, and directed by Jasmila Žbanić (director of the Oscar-nominated Quo Vadis, Aida?)
Episode 6 opens with a very brief recap of the grim conclusion of Episode 5, reliving the tragic and traumatic moment when Henry (Lamar Johnson) kills himself.
Joel asks about the best way West, to which Marlon says ‘Go east.’ Go past the river to the West, and there’s only death, say the couple.
Ellie asks Joel if she can try a swig of whiskey, which he reluctantly agrees to – a notable change in his attitude towards Ellie and their relationship.
Stumbling out of the bar, Joel begins to have another panic attack, finding himself short of breath.
