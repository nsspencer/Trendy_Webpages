     Presidents Day 2023: What are the origins and why is it celebrated on 20 February?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This year Presidents Day is being celebrated on Monday 20 February and many private businesses and public institutions will be taking the day off to mark the occasion.
Here’s everything you need to know…What are the origins of Presidents Day?
The origins of Presidents Day can be found more than two centuries ago and began with the death of President George Washington in 1799.
If you're calling it the other thing, I'd suggest Presidents Day, no apostrophe, as, e.g., Veterans Day is officially Veterans Day (a day of veterans, not one owned by them).
This suggestion was initially rejected but soon after the bill went into effect in 1971, Presidents Day became the commonly accepted name.
