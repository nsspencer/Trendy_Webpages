    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The BAFTA Awards 2023—technically the EE BAFTA Film Awards—are being held at the Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall, a 2,700-capacity venue that sits along the River Thames.
BAFTA is an acronym for British Academy of Film and Television Arts, if you were wondering, and EE is their sponsor, a mobile network and internet service provider.
This is the 76th BAFTA ceremony, and what is essentially the British equivalent to the Academy Awards.
They are Outstanding British Film; Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer; British Short Animation; and British Short Film.
There's also the EE BAFTA Rising Star award, a relatively new prize that began in 2005, that tends to go to British talent.

     ‘All Quiet on the Western Front’ Dominates BAFTA Awards With Record-Breaking Seven Wins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “All Quiet on the Western Front” dominated the BAFTA Awards in London on Sunday night with a record-breaking seven wins, including for Best Director, Best Film and Best Film Not in the English Language.
The tally means the World War One epic now holds the record for a film not in the English language.
But it was a disappointing night for “Tár,” with writer and director Todd Field losing out in the Best Original Screenplay and Best Director categories.
In addition to Butler’s win the film won in three craft categories: Best Hair and Make-Up, Best Casting and Best Costume.
The night felt lighter, edgier, and with a buzzy energy that’s been missing from the British awards for some time.
