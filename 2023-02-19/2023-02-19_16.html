     Will All Quiet on the Western Front win best picture Oscar?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some of the nominations for best picture at this year's Oscars were easy to predict.
It was also German – and no previous German film had ever been in the running for best picture.
And then it won the best film award at the Baftas, and an initially overlooked film became a hot favourite.
But the new rule has led to more unusual films appearing in the best picture line-up – and more films that aren't in English, too.
But ever since Alfonso Cuarón's Roma was nominated for 2019's top Oscar, there has been one non-English-language contender every year – and a Korean film, Parasite, won best picture in 2020.
