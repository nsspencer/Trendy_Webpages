     The Company You Keep Premiere: Grade Milo Ventimiglia's New ABC Drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The biggest con of all may be love in ABC’s new drama The Company You Keep.
But the next day, they get down to business, spending a blissful 36 hours in bed, frolicking in the pool and raiding the hotel bar.
Indefinitely,” Charlie suggests, but Emma knows it’s a fantasy.
As Charlies poses as the pastor’s contact and takes his suitcase of money, Emma gets a call from her CIA colleague about the drug trafficking ring she’s been tracking.
Back at the family bar, Charlie confronts his dad about his early memory loss.

     'The Company You Keep' review: Milo Ventimiglia stars in a cop-criminal romance that's not quite out of sight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Milo Ventimiglia is all about family again in “The Company You Keep,” only this time, it’s a family of thieves, and the romance he’s trying to balance is, unknowingly, with a CIA agent.
The complications to this meet-crime relationship, however, are higher than most, with Charlie’s family indebted to a criminal enterprise that Emma by happenstance is working to investigate.
That points to a potential collision of romantic fantasy and reality, and a major wakeup call for the two leads.
The challenge here is stretching that out in serialized form, as the lines already begin to intersect by the second episode.
“The Company You Keep” premieres February 19 at 10pm ET on ABC.

     ‘The Company You Keep’ Review: Milo Ventimiglia and Catherine Haena Kim in a Frothy ABC Drama With a Hint of Potential
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Our heroes: Charlie Nicoletti (Milo Ventimiglia) is an extraordinarily gifted con man in a family of cons.
Emma Hill (Catherine Haena Kim) is part of a family that aspires to be the Asian American Kennedys.
I know this, because in the second episode, a character says that Emma’s mother (Freda Foh Shen) wants them to be the Asian American Kennedys.
Maybe halfway through the second episode, The Company You Keep gets all of that stuff out of the way.
It remains to be seen if the show The Company You Keep eases into by its second episode is sustainable.

     Summary: [Warning: The below contains MAJOR spoilers for The Company You Keep series premiere.]
Later, after the job is done, when Birdie brings up the girl in front of their parents, Charlie shrugs it off.
“You don’t know what comes next” indeed, as she tells Charlie about their supposed happily ever after they’d had planned.
Emma’s right, because Daphne goes to Charlie to demand the money he (Tina) stole ($10 million, plus an addition $5 million, for the cost of getting Maguire out of prison).
So what did you think of The Company You Keep and Charlie and Emma’s chemistry?
