     Kyle Busch disgusted over finish for Daytona 500
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyle Busch disgusted over finish for Daytona 500Kyle Busch was absolutely disgusted over the finish for the Daytona 500 on Sunday.
Sunday’s Daytona 500 was the longest race in history as it lasted a record 212 laps.
The race went to two overtimes because of incidents down the stretch that led to cautions.
Busch was the leader with three laps remaining when the race went under caution due to Daniel Suarez spinning.
That was a reference to how Dale Earnhardt won his only Daytona 500.

     What a frustrated Kyle Busch is saying about leading in lap 200, crashing in Daytona 500 again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DAYTONA BEACH — Overtime dealt two of NASCAR's most snakebitten Daytona 500 drivers another dose of heartache Sunday night.
Brad Keselowski held the lead with four laps remaining until Kyle Busch snatched it from him with a pass.
The former Cup Series champions — Keselowski in 2012, and Busch on two occasions, most recently in 2019 — now hold a dubious combined record of 0-for-32 in the Daytona 500.

Mark Martin and Ricky Rudd each went 0 for 29, and Martin Truex Jr. holds the active mark with 19 straight Daytona 500 runs without a win.

     Late crashes mar end of Daytona 500, spoil Kyle Busch's potential win: 'Back in 1998, that would be the win'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyle Busch was just two laps away from winning his first Daytona 500.
Daniel Suarez spun out late in Sunday's race, bringing out the caution flag and forcing the race into overtime.
On lap 197, Busch took his first lead of the race and appeared to be pulling away to put himself in a position to win.
However, NASCAR declared Stenhouse the winner as he was leading when the caution flag came out.

     Summary: Kyle Busch (tie).
At various points in his career, Busch, who owns his team Kyle Busch Motorsports, won the NASCAR Cup Series and the NASCAR Xfinity Series.
“Back in 1998, that would be the win, boys!” Kyle Busch said.
Busch, similarly, entered Sunday’s Daytona 500 as a two-time Cup champion with almost every moniker imaginable.
“I hate it because I really wanted to get Kyle Busch into Victory Lane in the Daytona 500,” Dillon said.

     Monday Morning Pit Box: Bubba Wallace, Kyle Busch Bounce Back

     Summary: Welcome to the first 2023 edition of Monday Morning Pit Box, where we break down the critical calls that shape the outcome of each week’s race.
We take a look through the minds of those on pit road and, at times, call atop race control as well.
Busch, Wallace PersevereThe thing about this type of restrictor-plate racing is that it’s a luck of the draw.
That’s what both Bubba Wallace and Kyle Busch did on Sunday (Feb. 19) up until the final-lap wreck, as both were in a position to finish in the top five up to that point.
Going into the final laps, Busch and Richard Childress Racing teammate Austin Dillon were in prime position for a 1-2 finish before the late rash of cautions.

     Summary: Just another Daytona 500 disappointment.
“I wish it was 1998 rules,” he said, referring to seven-time NASCAR champion Dale Earnhardt’s Daytona 500 win in his 20th try under caution 25 years ago.
Truex, Busch and Keselowski were looking for a breakthrough Sunday, and each of them led laps.
Truex was out front for 13 trips around the 2 1/2-mile superspeedway; Busch led six laps.
After all, Hall of Famer David Pearson needed 15 tries to win the Daytona 500.

Kyle is chasing his first career win at the Daytona 500, a win that has eluded him for nearly 20 years… and he was pretty damn close today.

     Summary: DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Ricky Stenhouse Jr. barely edged out Joey Logano when the final caution flag waved on Sunday (Feb. 19) at Daytona International Speedway to win his first Daytona 500.
And it’s the same thing we’ve been seeing on these racetracks in the new car since last year’s Daytona 500.
It’s the Daytona 500 and that comes with its quirks.
For you history buffs out there, that’s the longest a Daytona 500 has gone without a crash since 1998.
Wendy’s partnered with the Las Vegas native for his second career Daytona 500 to be on board his No.
