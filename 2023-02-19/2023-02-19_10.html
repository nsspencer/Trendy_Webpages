     Presidents' Day Is a Good Reminder To Treat the Presidency With Skepticism
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Each February, Americans celebrate Presidents' Day with those two national pastimes: a day off work if they can get it, and sales on consumer goods.
But this is exactly the wrong way to think about any government position, much less one imbued with as much power as the presidency.
And yet the office of the presidency remains broadly popular, and the president's power tends to go unchallenged, what Healy refers to as "the cult of the presidency."
As Reason's Billy Binion wrote, "Presidents aren't saints.
And Presidents' Day is a perfect time to remember to treat the office not with inherent respect but just as any other taxpayer-funded role.

     Only in Alabama: Why Presidents Day is different here
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Most all of the U.S. commemorates today as Presidents Day.
In 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Bill which moved the day off Washington’s birthday to the third Monday in February.
Alabama is the only state to combine Washington and Jefferson, though no state that was part of the Confederacy mentions Lincoln by name as part of its Presidents Day holiday.
South Carolina celebrates Washington’s Birthday/Presidents Day; Mississippi, Georgia and Virginia commemorate George Washington Day; no holiday is observed in Florida, North Carolina or Louisiana; and Texas and Tennessee have Presidents Day.
Arkansas also takes a unique approach to Presidents Day.

     Presidents Day 2023: What are the origins and why is it celebrated on 20 February?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This year Presidents Day is being celebrated on Monday 20 February and many private businesses and public institutions will be taking the day off to mark the occasion.
Here’s everything you need to know…What are the origins of Presidents Day?
The origins of Presidents Day can be found more than two centuries ago and began with the death of President George Washington in 1799.
If you're calling it the other thing, I'd suggest Presidents Day, no apostrophe, as, e.g., Veterans Day is officially Veterans Day (a day of veterans, not one owned by them).
This suggestion was initially rejected but soon after the bill went into effect in 1971, Presidents Day became the commonly accepted name.

His works include the bestseller "Don't Know Much About History" and also "In The Shadow Of Liberty: The Hidden History of Slavery, Four Presidents And Five Black Lives."
MARTIN: As I mentioned earlier, your sort of seminal work, "Don't Know Much About History," is a huge bestseller.
I'm thinking as - specifically of "In The Shadow Of Liberty: The Hidden History Of Slavery, Four Presidents And Five Black Lives."
DAVIS: I say that it's really, really important and valuable to understand those documents that these men wrote because they still really ring true.
