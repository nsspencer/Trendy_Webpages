     2023 NBA All-Star Game MVP: Celtics' Jayson Tatum earns honor after setting scoring record with 55 points
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is one of the best scorers in the league, and he reminded everyone of that fact on Sunday night by re-writing the NBA All-Star Game record books with 55 points in Team Giannis' 184-175 win over Team LeBron.
For his efforts, Tatum was also named All-Star Game MVP.
"It means the world," Tatum said of setting the scoring record.
Along with his full-game scoring record, Tatum set the mark for the most points in a single quarter in All-Star history with 27 in the third frame.
Tatum's MVP was the ninth time that a Celtics player has won the award, but the first in over 40 years.

     2023 NBA All-Star Game score: Jayson Tatum breaks scoring record, wins MVP; LeBron James' streak ends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2023 NBA All-Star Game is officially in the books as Team Giannis has taken down Team LeBron by the score of 184-175 to hand the league's all-time scoring champion his first loss as an All-Star Game captain.
In the end, Jayson Tatum stole the show as the Celtics star earned MVP honors after breaking Anthony Davis' All-Star Game scoring record with 55 points in the victory.
That drags down his All-Star scoring average, which was at a robust eight points per All-Star Game before this one.
"I am not meant for this game," Jokic said after the game.
At this point, the All-Star Game hardly even resembles a typical game of basketball, and if that continues, it's worth asking what non-financial purpose the event even serves.

FINAL: Team Giannis 184, Team LeBron 175ADVERTISEMENTGiannis scores first, then departsGiannis Antetokounmpo made sure to get into the action right away, dunking the ball on the game's opening possession.

After Team Giannis missed a number of deep heaves in an attempt to close the game on a long-ball, Damian Lillard drained a vintage side-step 3 to seal it for Team Giannis and break Team LeBron's five-game unbeaten streak.
