The tap and goKenny Smith wasn't sure if McClung tapped the glass before flushing his first dunk.
This was crazy to pull off as your first dunk, on your first try, with all the hoopla surrounding McClung in this contest.
The 360 windmillI can't believe I'm calling this McClung's "worst" dunk.
But for all intents and purposes, this is a 360 with a windmill thrown in the middle of the revolution.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SALT LAKE CITY (AP) ‚Äî Mac McClung might have single-handedly restored the shine on a dunk contest that has been widely panned in recent years.
‚ÄúEver since the beginning, I was the underdog,‚Äù said McClung, who put on a Gate City jersey ‚Äî his high school and hometown in Virginia, population 1,600 ‚Äî for the final dunk.
Riding the momentum of that perfect dunk, he wound up hoisting the trophy that was newly renamed for dunking legend ‚Äî and former 76ers star ‚Äî Julius ‚ÄúDr.
No judge agreed, and his two-dunk score of 95.4 wasn‚Äôt good enough to make the final round.
I‚Äôm happy that I did it in my home, coming back here to Utah.‚ÄùLillard won the final round with 26 points.
