     Summary: Ja Morant was drafted by Team Giannis for Sunday's NBA All-Star Game.
But Giannis Antetokounmpo tried to draft him early and briefly forgot the rules of the All-Star Draft.
Antetokounmpo picked Morant as his third overall pick but forgot that the starters would be drafted after the reserves.
Morant and the rest of the All-Stars started laughing on the stage and Antetokounmpo had to be reminded he couldn't select Morant until the reserves were taken.
The Milwaukee Bucks forward ended up drafting Morant with his second pick among the NBA starters.

     Giannis Antetokounmpo To Have More Tests On Sprained Wrist

     Summary: Giannis Antetokounmpo will undergo additional tests on his sprained right wrist today in New York, according to Tim Bontemps of ESPN.
Antetokounmpo served as a captain in Sunday’s All-Star Game, but played just 20 seconds to avoid aggravating the injury.
“Taking it day by day, try to get healthy,” Antetokounmpo said after Sunday’s game.
I don’t think it’s smart in any way to … play a lot of minutes in the All-Star Game.
At the end of the day, obviously, you want to participate, you want to run up and down, joke around, have some dunks, create some work.

(1:41)SALT LAKE CITY -- Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo will travel to New York on Monday to undergo further testing on his injured right wrist, sources told ESPN.
Wearing a wrap on his right wrist, Antetokounmpo participated in the first live player draft for the All-Star Game alongside LeBron James (who also wound up leaving the game early because of a hand injury).
"Taking it day by day, try to get healthy," Antetokounmpo said when asked after the game about his level of concern about his wrist.

     Giannis Antetokounmpo injury update: Bucks star traveling to New York for further testing on wrist, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo will travel to New York to undergo further testing on his injured right wrist, according to Tim Bontemps.
Antetokounmpo left the Bucks' final game before the All-Star break, a 112-100 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Thursday, and was diagnosed with a sprain.
Early in the second quarter against the Bulls, Antetokounmpo went to contest a layup by Coby White and took an awkward stumble around the basket stanchion.
He played the first 20 seconds of the All-Star Game and scored one basket, but did most of his work pre-game as he fulfilled his duties as a captain during the All-Star Draft.
He ended up selecting the winning squad, as Team Antetokounmpo defeated Team LeBron, 184-175, thanks to a record-setting 55-point performance by Jayson Tatum.

This time there’s concern for Giannis Antetokounmpo’s wrist following a scary fall against the Chicago Bulls in their last game before the All-Star break.
Antetokounmpo was clearly favoring it in the 20 seconds he played in the All-Star game, had it wrapped, and acknowledged it is a concern.
When play resumes, the Bucks are riding a 12-game win streak that will be tested, with or without their star.
