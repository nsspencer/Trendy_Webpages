     Phoenix Suns considered slim favorites over Mavericks in Game 6 tilt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns got their Western Conference semifinals matchup with the Dallas Mavericks back on track with a dominating Game 5 win on Tuesday night.
But despite the 110-80 beatdown to take a 3-2 series lead, the Suns are considered slight favorites when the semifinal heads back to Dallas for Game 6.
Both FanDuel and DraftKings sportsbooks have the Suns as two-point favorites for Thursday night’s contest.
It’s not entirely shocking, however, given the Suns’ track record on the road this series.
Despite a 35-point effort from Suns guard Devin Booker, the Suns were on the losing end of a double-digit Game 4 loss.

     Summary: The Suns’ defense was making Luka Doncic uncomfortable and forcing turnovers.
The Suns dominated the third quarter 33-14 and never looked back, turning the game into a 30-point laugher at the end.
Phoenix won Game 5 110-80, and the Suns are now up 3-2 in the series.
Even through that run, it seemed the Mavericks were making difficult shots while the Suns were getting the better looks.
But Booker said the key to the Suns’ third quarter — they started the second half on a 19-4 run — was defense.

     Summary: The Phoenix Suns are one victory away from a second straight trip to the Western Conference finals.
To clinch a spot on Thursday night, they have to do something they haven't yet done in this series: Win in Dallas against the Mavericks.
The Suns lost Games 3 and 4 in Dallas and aim to become the first road team to win in the best-of-seven conference semifinal series.
They hold a 3-2 series lead after blistering the Mavericks 110-80 on Tuesday night in Phoenix.
The Suns outscored Dallas 33-14 to take a 22-point lead into the final quarter.

     3 Things We Learned From Suns-Mavericks Game 5 On Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Offensively, Phoenix still struggled at times to get things clicking from three-point range, but their defense really stepped up and they played to their strengths in this game.
Game 6 of this series will be played down in Dallas on Thursday night, a game that will surely be filled with physical play.
“Hero-Ball” Triumphed Again For DallasThe reason the Dallas Mavericks won Games 3 and 4 at home, besides their high defensive effort, was because of how well they “spread the wealth” on offense.
In Game 5, Dallas once again relied too heavily on Doncic playing “hero-ball” and as a result, they got walloped by the Suns on Tuesday night.
17-0 Runs Tend To Result In A WinWhat they did in the third quarter is what allowed the Phoenix Suns to win Game 5 on Tuesday night.

     Suns wallop Mavericks behind opportunistic defense to take commanding series lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Five of the Suns six playoff series over the past two seasons have gone six games.
The Denver Nuggets series was a four game sweep, but all of the Lakers, Clippers, Bucks, Pelicans and now Dallas Mavericks series have gone (at least) six games.
Of those five long series, the Suns were tied 2-2 in four them.
This time, in Game 6, the Suns will have to find a way to play in Dallas like they’ve played in Phoenix.
The Suns play the Mavericks on Thursday night, at 6:30PM.

     5 takeaways from Suns' Game 5 romp against Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What’s important to note here is the Mavericks entered Tuesdays’ game averaging a 2022 playoffs-best 9.7 turnovers in the postseason.
It actually marked the first time an NBA team totaled fewer than 10 assists in a playoff game since 2016 (Charlotte Hornets at Miami).
Booker and Charles Barkley are the only two Suns to put up 800 points in their first 30 career playoff games.
A seven-year veteran playing in just his second postseason, Booker said he’s always prepared for these moments, even when they appeared farfetched.
So, I had to use some imagination playing in playoff games in my workouts.
