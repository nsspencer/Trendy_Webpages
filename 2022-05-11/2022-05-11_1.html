     Bickley: Suns G Devin Booker's maniacal ambition shaped him for limelight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s certainly what Devin Booker was doing under the basket on Tuesday, feigning injury after a flagrant foul in the second half of Game 5.
With Chris Paul marginalized by something unspoken, it’s clear that Booker must be the engine that powers this team to a championship.
After Tuesday’s victory, Suns head coach Monty Williams said Booker has “shot-making ability that’s unique to very few people.” High praise, indeed.
The video of Booker playing dead to mock Doncic has enraged the Dallas fan base.
If Luka was the bad guy in Phoenix on Tuesday, Booker will be the villain on Thursday night in Dallas.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Suns’ defense was making Luka Doncic uncomfortable and forcing turnovers.
The Suns dominated the third quarter 33-14 and never looked back, turning the game into a 30-point laugher at the end.
Phoenix won Game 5 110-80, and the Suns are now up 3-2 in the series.
Even through that run, it seemed the Mavericks were making difficult shots while the Suns were getting the better looks.
But Booker said the key to the Suns’ third quarter — they started the second half on a 19-4 run — was defense.

     3 Things We Learned From Suns-Mavericks Game 5 On Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Offensively, Phoenix still struggled at times to get things clicking from three-point range, but their defense really stepped up and they played to their strengths in this game.
Game 6 of this series will be played down in Dallas on Thursday night, a game that will surely be filled with physical play.
“Hero-Ball” Triumphed Again For DallasThe reason the Dallas Mavericks won Games 3 and 4 at home, besides their high defensive effort, was because of how well they “spread the wealth” on offense.
In Game 5, Dallas once again relied too heavily on Doncic playing “hero-ball” and as a result, they got walloped by the Suns on Tuesday night.
17-0 Runs Tend To Result In A WinWhat they did in the third quarter is what allowed the Phoenix Suns to win Game 5 on Tuesday night.

     Home teams still perfect as Game 6 looms for Suns, Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If they can’t win Thursday’s Game 6 at American Airlines Center in Dallas, they’ll return home to the friendly confines of Footprint Center for Game 7.
“They’re an amazing team,” Mavericks superstar guard Luka Doncic said.
From the 2019-20 regular season to 2021-22, Phoenix bested the Mavs four games in a row at American Airlines Center.
Yet in the games played at American Airlines Center, the Mavericks found a way to negate Phoenix’s vaunted defense, averaging 107 points in their two victories.
“Defense, that’s what got us going,” Suns center Deandre Ayton said after Game 5.

     Suns wallop Mavericks behind opportunistic defense to take commanding series lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Five of the Suns six playoff series over the past two seasons have gone six games.
The Denver Nuggets series was a four game sweep, but all of the Lakers, Clippers, Bucks, Pelicans and now Dallas Mavericks series have gone (at least) six games.
Of those five long series, the Suns were tied 2-2 in four them.
This time, in Game 6, the Suns will have to find a way to play in Dallas like they’ve played in Phoenix.
The Suns play the Mavericks on Thursday night, at 6:30PM.
