     Bill Simmons heartbreak caught on camera after brutal Celtics loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Someone should check on Bill Simmons after the Celtics suffered a crushing loss to the Bucks on Wednesday in Game 5 of their conference semifinals series.
Lucky for Simmons, the latter hit, as Tatum dropped 34 points to go with six rebounds and four assists.
Simmons snapped a photo with a fan before the game, in which the sports analyst appeared much happier.
The fan expressed in her caption that she was excited to watch Simmons live-tweet the game, but he hasn’t tweeted a single thing since he predicted the Celtics to win Game 5.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All of this helped the Bucks chip away at the Celtics’ 14-point lead slowly but surely through the fourth quarter.
However, like countless moments in years past, Marcus Smart became involved quite prominently for the Celtics in crunch time on the offensive end of the floor.
Celtics lead 105-102, 1:06 remainingThe Celtics corral a rebound after Portis misses a bunny and a putback.
They were probably gassed at this stage but they were running like it was a regular season Wednesday night game, not a potential ticket to the East Finals.
The Celtics need Smart for his top-level defense, passing and ability to knock down an open 3.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jrue Holiday makes a pair of crucial defensive plays against Marcus Smart to lead the Bucks to a pivotal Game 5 victory over the Celtics.
21 that cleanly ripped the shot out of his hands before it could enter Celtics lore as a game winner.
Within seconds, Holiday was in Antetokounmpo's arms, and the Bucks were one win from taking this tremendous series.
The Bucks were on the ropes a handful of times, and Antetokounmpo's basket attacks kept them in the game.
"We're in Boston, we're down 14 in the fourth quarter and people would say that everything's against us," Holiday said.

     Summary: Celtics 6 takeaways as Bobby Portis and Bucks stun Celtics late in crushing Game 5 loss The Celtics led by 14 in the fourth quarter but couldn't secure the win.
Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics goes to the basket against Bobby Portis of the Milwaukee Bucks and Jrue Holiday.
Advertisement:“It was tough, tough away to lose,” Jayson Tatum said.
When the official handed White the ball, Horford stayed put for entirely too long.
Marcus Smart gestured across the court, then tried to make a play, but Holiday’s heroics saved the Bucks (Smart almost certainly was about to score).

     Summary: BOSTON – The Milwaukee Bucks will head home with a chance to advance to the Eastern Conference finals after a stirring 110-107 comeback victory over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night at TD Garden.
First, Portis assisted on a Holiday three-pointer to tie the game at 105 with 41 seconds left.
That led to a Bucks timeout and two Pat Connaughton free throws to make it 110-107 with five seconds remaining.
Antetokounmpo scored 19 of the Bucks’ points while Holiday added nine, but the other six players to see court time combined for only 19 points.
And, after a 3-for-4 start to the game, Holiday missed his last five shots of the first half for Milwaukee.
