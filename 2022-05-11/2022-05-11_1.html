     Bickley: Suns G Devin Booker's maniacal ambition shaped him for limelight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s certainly what Devin Booker was doing under the basket on Tuesday, feigning injury after a flagrant foul in the second half of Game 5.
With Chris Paul marginalized by something unspoken, it’s clear that Booker must be the engine that powers this team to a championship.
After Tuesday’s victory, Suns head coach Monty Williams said Booker has “shot-making ability that’s unique to very few people.” High praise, indeed.
The video of Booker playing dead to mock Doncic has enraged the Dallas fan base.
If Luka was the bad guy in Phoenix on Tuesday, Booker will be the villain on Thursday night in Dallas.

     3 Things We Learned From Suns-Mavericks Game 5 On Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Offensively, Phoenix still struggled at times to get things clicking from three-point range, but their defense really stepped up and they played to their strengths in this game.
Game 6 of this series will be played down in Dallas on Thursday night, a game that will surely be filled with physical play.
“Hero-Ball” Triumphed Again For DallasThe reason the Dallas Mavericks won Games 3 and 4 at home, besides their high defensive effort, was because of how well they “spread the wealth” on offense.
In Game 5, Dallas once again relied too heavily on Doncic playing “hero-ball” and as a result, they got walloped by the Suns on Tuesday night.
17-0 Runs Tend To Result In A WinWhat they did in the third quarter is what allowed the Phoenix Suns to win Game 5 on Tuesday night.

     Suns wallop Mavericks behind opportunistic defense to take commanding series lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Five of the Suns six playoff series over the past two seasons have gone six games.
The Denver Nuggets series was a four game sweep, but all of the Lakers, Clippers, Bucks, Pelicans and now Dallas Mavericks series have gone (at least) six games.
Of those five long series, the Suns were tied 2-2 in four them.
This time, in Game 6, the Suns will have to find a way to play in Dallas like they’ve played in Phoenix.
The Suns play the Mavericks on Thursday night, at 6:30PM.

     5 takeaways from Suns' Game 5 romp against Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What’s important to note here is the Mavericks entered Tuesdays’ game averaging a 2022 playoffs-best 9.7 turnovers in the postseason.
It actually marked the first time an NBA team totaled fewer than 10 assists in a playoff game since 2016 (Charlotte Hornets at Miami).
Booker and Charles Barkley are the only two Suns to put up 800 points in their first 30 career playoff games.
A seven-year veteran playing in just his second postseason, Booker said he’s always prepared for these moments, even when they appeared farfetched.
So, I had to use some imagination playing in playoff games in my workouts.

     Summary: The Mavericks’ 110-80 Game 5 loss to the Suns ended with some chippiness.
First, with just over two seconds left in the game, Suns center Bismack Biyombo soared for a dunk attempt with the Suns up by 28 points.
Mavericks center Marquese Chriss took offense to the play and fouled Biyombo, preventing the easy two points.
