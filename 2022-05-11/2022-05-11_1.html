     Summary: DALLAS — There’s nothing like a potential closeout game with star power and we will be treated to that on Thursday evening in Dallas for the Phoenix Suns’ Game 6 against the Mavericks with a 3-2 series lead.
The dramatic difference between the two groups in wins and losses persisted in Tuesday’s Game 5.
The most important addition to that equation was the best on-ball defense the Suns have played in this series.
This is the Suns defense I am used to.

     3 Things We Learned From Suns-Mavericks Game 5 On Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Offensively, Phoenix still struggled at times to get things clicking from three-point range, but their defense really stepped up and they played to their strengths in this game.
Game 6 of this series will be played down in Dallas on Thursday night, a game that will surely be filled with physical play.
“Hero-Ball” Triumphed Again For DallasThe reason the Dallas Mavericks won Games 3 and 4 at home, besides their high defensive effort, was because of how well they “spread the wealth” on offense.
In Game 5, Dallas once again relied too heavily on Doncic playing “hero-ball” and as a result, they got walloped by the Suns on Tuesday night.
17-0 Runs Tend To Result In A WinWhat they did in the third quarter is what allowed the Phoenix Suns to win Game 5 on Tuesday night.

     Home teams still perfect as Game 6 looms for Suns, Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If they can’t win Thursday’s Game 6 at American Airlines Center in Dallas, they’ll return home to the friendly confines of Footprint Center for Game 7.
“They’re an amazing team,” Mavericks superstar guard Luka Doncic said.
From the 2019-20 regular season to 2021-22, Phoenix bested the Mavs four games in a row at American Airlines Center.
Yet in the games played at American Airlines Center, the Mavericks found a way to negate Phoenix’s vaunted defense, averaging 107 points in their two victories.
“Defense, that’s what got us going,” Suns center Deandre Ayton said after Game 5.

     Suns smack down sets up a spicy Game 6 in Dallas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns are now one game away from their second straight appearance in the Western Conference Finals after blowing out the Dallas Mavericks, 110-80.
A minute and a half into the third, Mavericks’ guard Jalen Brunson cut the Suns’ lead down to 1 on a mid-range fadeaway from the left post.
This would be the Maverick's last points for over 5 full minutes as the Suns ripped off a 17-0 run and broke the game wide open.
Suns’ coach Monty Williams made adjustments to his game plan ahead of last night, but the improved efforts of the team as a whole defensively were evident as well and especially so in the second half.
Otherwise, you can bet these two teams will be back here at the Footprint Center on Sunday for Game 7.
