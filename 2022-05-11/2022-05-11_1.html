     Celtics’ turnaround season has been about resiliency, now Boston faces toughest test in Game 6 at Bucks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — As Ime Udoka pointed out postgame, the Celtics’ mantra this season has been all about how they have responded to adversity.
And every single time the Celtics stared in the Bucks’ face in a crucial game, they delivered.
Of course, those efforts came crumbling down in Game 5 in a 110-107 loss to the Bucks on Wednesday at TD Garden.
“What we’ve been done throughout the series and throughout the season is bounce back when we’ve been tested — and even in this series,” Udoka said.
Game 6 will be the Celtics’ biggest test of the season, and in the present, there’s nothing beyond that.

The Bucks were on the ropes a handful of times, and Antetokounmpo's basket attacks kept them in the game.
"We're in Boston, we're down 14 in the fourth quarter and people would say that everything's against us," Holiday said.

     Summary: BOSTON – The Milwaukee Bucks will head home with a chance to advance to the Eastern Conference finals after a stirring 110-107 comeback victory over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night at TD Garden.
First, Portis assisted on a Holiday three-pointer to tie the game at 105 with 41 seconds left.

Antetokounmpo scored 19 of the Bucks’ points while Holiday added nine, but the other six players to see court time combined for only 19 points.
