     Bucks 110, Celtics 107: Holiday, Portis combine for incredible finish as Milwaukee completes comeback
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON – The Milwaukee Bucks will head home with a chance to advance to the Eastern Conference finals after a stirring 110-107 comeback victory over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night at TD Garden.
First, Portis assisted on a Holiday three-pointer to tie the game at 105 with 41 seconds left.
That led to a Bucks timeout and two Pat Connaughton free throws to make it 110-107 with five seconds remaining.
Antetokounmpo scored 19 of the Bucks’ points while Holiday added nine, but the other six players to see court time combined for only 19 points.
And, after a 3-for-4 start to the game, Holiday missed his last five shots of the first half for Milwaukee.

     Bucks vs. Celtics score, takeaways: Milwaukee pulls off fourth quarter comeback to steal Game 5 against Boston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bucks' complete miracle comebackThe Bucks should have lost on Wednesday night, and 99 times out of 100 they would have considering the circumstances.
Miss those and we're potentially talking about a 20-point Celtics win.
Giannis' massive triple late in the fourth came from an offensive rebound, which was another key to the comeback.
The Celtics' elite defense has stifled the Bucks all series, and was doing so once again in the fourth quarter -- at least on the initial shot.
Eight of the Bucks' whopping 17 offensive rebounds came in the fourth quarter, and nine of their 20 second-chance points came in the frame.
