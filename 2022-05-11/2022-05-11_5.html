     Consumer Prices Are Still Climbing Rapidly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Annual inflation moderated for the first time in months in April, but the Consumer Price Index still increased 8.3 percent, an uncomfortably rapid pace.
At the same time, a closely watched measure that subtracts food and fuel costs actually accelerated.
Core inflation — which excludes costs for groceries and gas — picked up 0.6 percent in April from the prior month, faster than its 0.3 percent increase in March.
That measure is particularly important for policymakers, who use it as a gauge to help determine where inflation is headed.
While the letup in annual inflation may have given President Biden and the Fed a dose of comfort, the overall picture remains worrying.

     How to calculate your personal inflation rate and why it matters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inflation eased slightly in April to an annual rate of 8.3 percent, down from an annual rate of 8.5 percent in March, according to data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Inflation remains near a 40-year high and is widespread, but how you experience particular price increases depends on your spending patterns.
Calculating your personal inflation rate will give you a much better idea of how hard you’re actually being hit by rising prices — and where.
To calculate your personal inflation rate for April, for instance, total your monthly expenses for April 2021.
For example, if you spent $5300 in April 2022 and $5050 in April 2021, your personal inflation rate (250 divided by 5050) is 4.9 percent.

     Another key inflation measure slowed in April
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) Economists and investors are hopeful that we're past the pandemic inflation peak, as another key price index showed a slower increase in April.
The PPI showed that between March and April, the average prices that America's producers were paid for their goods and services increased by 0.5%.
It was a marked deceleration from the previous month, when prices rose by 1.6%.
Stripping out more volatile prices for food, energy and trade services, the PPI rose 6.9% in the year ended in April.
For the month alone, the so-called core prices rose 0.6%, less than in the prior month.

     Summary: Food banks across America say those economic conditions are intensifying demand for their support at a time when their labor and distribution costs are climbing and donations are slowing.
For many families like the Nunamakers, food insecurity became a painful surprise.
The pandemic forced roughly 60 million Americans to seek help for food insecurity, according to Feeding America.
At the end of 2021, as hiring boomed, demand for food banks returned to regular levels.
“So we are working extra hard to reach people who have the deepest food insecurity rates.

     US inflation dips from 4-decade high but still causing pain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even if it moderates, inflation will likely remain high well into 2023, economists say, leaving many Americans burdened by price increases that have outpaced pay raises.
Especially hurt are lower-income and Black and Hispanic families, who on average spend a greater proportion of their incomes on gas, food and rent.
In April, a fallback in gas prices helped slow overall inflation.
But since then, gas prices have surged to a record $4.40 a gallon.
Food prices rose 1% from March to April and nearly 11% from a year ago.

     Summary: Prices at the wholesale level accelerated further in April, part of a broader inflation problem persisting through the U.S. economy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.
The producer price index, which tracks how much manufacturers get for products at their initial sale, rose 0.5% on the month and 11% from a year ago, a decrease from the record 11.5% in March.
Excluding food, energy and trade services, core PPI rose 0.6% in April and 6.9% from a year ago, the latter a decline from 7.1% last month.
Headline PPI rose 1.6% in March while core was up 0.9%.
Auto prices, particularly for used vehicles, also have been a major inflation component, and the PPI index for motor vehicles and equipment increased 0.8% on the month.

     Has inflation finally peaked?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (The Hill) – Inflation may have finally peaked after more than a year of supply chain snarls, labor shortages and a flood of stimulus driving prices higher.
Knightley said he expected the yearly inflation rate to continue to fall as consumers spend a greater share of their money on in-person services instead of goods snarled in supply chains, a major force behind the inflation surge.
Higher gas prices also fuel inflation for other goods and services, especially food and transportation, which involve high levels of travel and energy usage.
A record 18.6 percent monthly spike in airline ticket prices and 0.5 percent increase in shelter costs also played key roles in April’s inflation.
It takes at least a year for an acceleration in rents and homeownership costs to show up in inflation measures,” she explained.

Advertisement“While it is heartening to see that annual inflation moderated in April, the fact remains that inflation is unacceptably high,” President Biden said in a statement Wednesday.
The food index increased 0.9 percent in April compared with March, notching its 17th consecutive monthly increase.
Fed officials often look to core inflation to understand how inflation is behaving across the entire economy.

     Summary: The American Rescue Plan was drafted with good intentions, but it caused real problems.
Even before the American Rescue Plan passed, “the seeds for a high-inflation environment were already planted,” said Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
International comparisons, though, suggest the US would have bounced back without the American Rescue Plan, though more slowly.
The criticisms of the American Rescue PlanThe case that the American Rescue Plan contributed to inflation has three parts: its size, its timing, and the details of its spending.
“The sweet spot, I think, might have been a $300-500 billion American Rescue Plan,” said Strain.
