     At least 20 homes in Southern California engulfed by a fast-moving blaze as authorities urge evacuations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) At least 20 homes were set ablaze Wednesday in parts of the Laguna Hills area of Orange County, California, as a brush fire rapidly grew and spread to residences that were either destroyed or damaged, official said.
Flames swallowed entire homes and burned through to their interiors in one neighborhood while firefighters hosed down nearby houses on the same street hoping to save them, footage from CNN affiliate KCBS/KCAL showed.
Jennifer McCoy, a Laguna Beach resident, told CNN she first noticed smoke coming from Laguna Niguel -- approximately 8 miles away -- around 4:15 p.m. Less than two hours later, the smoke clouds had ballooned even larger, McCoy said.
A fast-moving fire consumed homes in Orange County, California, Wednesday.
"I walked down to the shopping center below and the smoke grew maybe two to three times what it was before," she said.

The fire was just getting stronger, and the smoke was getting thicker and thicker,” Kothlow said.
“I saw it hit the palm trees, and as soon as I saw that I knew those houses were gone.
