     Leeds beaten by Chelsea as relegation fears heighten
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LEEDS, England, May 11 (Reuters) - Leeds United edged closer to Premier League relegation after goals from Mason Mount, Christian Pulisic and Romelu Lukaku earned Chelsea a comfortable 3-0 victory over the 10-man hosts on Wednesday.
Coming into the match, Leeds had conceded 34 home league goals this season, their most in the top-flight in a single campaign since 1959-60.
The fourth-minute goal was the earliest Leeds have conceded in a Premier League match since December 2020.
Chelsea went ahead 2-0 when Mount flicked the ball into Pulisic, who was left free to pick his spot.
"But at the same time the level of focus has to stay high as Leeds will never stop fighting.

"I tell you not as a coach and not as an expert, but for me it is very unlikely," Tuchel said.
"For me, I am not a doctor and we need to wait for the examinations, but it is very unlikely he can play.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mason Mount opened the scoring in the early stages at Elland Road and Leeds suffered another blow when Daniel James was sent off.
Christian Pulisic bagged Chelsea's second goal after half-time and Romelu Lukaku wrapped up the Blues' first win in four games.
Arresting their worrying recent slump was the ideal preparation for Chelsea ahead of Saturday's FA Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley.
While Chelsea look to end the season on a high, Leeds are in grave danger of relegation.
James was the second Leeds player to be shown a straight red card in successive matches following Luke Ayling's dismissal at Arsenal.

     Summary: Conceding early is disastrous enough, as Leeds did on Sunday and again here when Mason Mount struck past Illan Meslier after four minutes.
You need to be disciplined because Leeds never stop running.”Mason Mount gives Chelsea an early lead.
Leeds could, and perhaps should, have been more than one goal behind by half-time but the result was decided by James’s shocking tackle.
But Chelsea deserve credit for the manner in which they handled a rumbustious home crowd and a potentially tricky evening’s work.
The third goal always felt inevitable but after a slew of missed chances it took until the final seven minutes to arrive.

     Chelsea announce cryptocurrency firm WhaleFin as new shirt sleeve sponsors in £20m-a-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea have announced cryptocurrency firm WhaleFin as their new shirt sleeve sponsors for the 2022-23 campaign.
He has partnered with fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter, Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss as well as investment firm Clearlake Capital.
And following Boehly's arrival in west London, the European champions have now confirmed a £20m-a-year deal with burgeoning group WhaleFin, who are set to replace South Korean car firm Hyundai as shirt sleeve sponsors next season.
It is also worth double the amount of their current package with Hyundai, who sealed a five-year deal worth £50million (£10million per year) with the west London club back in 2018.
In the end that proved impossible, but Chelsea are already understood to be looking at alternative sponsors despite having one year left on their deal with Three.
