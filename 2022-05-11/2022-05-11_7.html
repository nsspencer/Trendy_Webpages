     Mason Mount Demands Chelsea Win FA Cup Final to End Consecutive Wembley Defeats
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount has demanded his side lift the FA Cup trophy when facing Liverpool in the final on Saturday to put an end to a miserable run of cup final losses.
The Blues have lost back-to-back FA Cup finals to Arsenal and Leicester City, whilst previously losing the Carabao Cup final to Liverpool this season.
Speaking after Chelsea's win over Leeds United, via Sky Sports, Mount looked ahead to the FA Cup final, admitting he is excited.
Chelsea face Liverpool on Saturday, with the chance to seek revenge on the Reds after they beat the Blues on penalties back in February to win the Carabao Cup.
It was a fantastic game we lost in the Carabao Cup final.

     Leeds beaten by Chelsea as relegation fears heighten
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LEEDS, England, May 11 (Reuters) - Leeds United edged closer to Premier League relegation after goals from Mason Mount, Christian Pulisic and Romelu Lukaku earned Chelsea a comfortable 3-0 victory over the 10-man hosts on Wednesday.
Coming into the match, Leeds had conceded 34 home league goals this season, their most in the top-flight in a single campaign since 1959-60.
The fourth-minute goal was the earliest Leeds have conceded in a Premier League match since December 2020.
Chelsea went ahead 2-0 when Mount flicked the ball into Pulisic, who was left free to pick his spot.
"But at the same time the level of focus has to stay high as Leeds will never stop fighting.

     Summary: Conceding early is disastrous enough, as Leeds did on Sunday and again here when Mason Mount struck past Illan Meslier after four minutes.
You need to be disciplined because Leeds never stop running.”Mason Mount gives Chelsea an early lead.
Leeds could, and perhaps should, have been more than one goal behind by half-time but the result was decided by James’s shocking tackle.
But Chelsea deserve credit for the manner in which they handled a rumbustious home crowd and a potentially tricky evening’s work.
The third goal always felt inevitable but after a slew of missed chances it took until the final seven minutes to arrive.

Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesEmma Hayes’s side would see a Wembley victory over Manchester City as the cherry on the cake.
Chelsea will be confident going into the final but I fancy Manchester City, which I know sounds really strange.
Chelsea have the experience of winning last season’s Cup as recently as December but City beat them in the Continental Cup final in March.
They have an in-form Sam Kerr and as we saw in last season’s Cup final against Arsenal, they are so good in transitions and with direct balls over the top.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Payment has to be made in such a way that the Russian oligarch is not seen to have benefited.
It’s unclear as well why Boehly and his consortium should have agreed to a price as high as £4.25 billion.
Given that UEFA voted this week on a revised, expanded format for the Champions League group stage, that may be reasonable.
That said, chairman Bruce Buck, director Marina Granovskaia and manager Thomas Tuchel are reportedly all expected to remain after the takeover is completed.
Slowly, the uncertainty around the club is lifting, but it could be a couple of years yet before the post-Abramovich future really begins to take shape.

Christian Pulisic bagged Chelsea's second goal after half-time and Romelu Lukaku wrapped up the Blues' first win in four games.
Arresting their worrying recent slump was the ideal preparation for Chelsea ahead of Saturday's FA Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley.
While Chelsea look to end the season on a high, Leeds are in grave danger of relegation.
James was the second Leeds player to be shown a straight red card in successive matches following Luke Ayling's dismissal at Arsenal.
