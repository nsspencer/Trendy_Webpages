     Manchin to oppose Democratic bill guaranteeing abortion access
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on Wednesday said he would oppose a Democratic bill to guarantee abortion access nationwide, indicating that it was too broad to get his vote.
“We’re going to be voting for a piece of legislation that I will not be voting for today,” Manchin told reporters.
I was hopeful for that, but I found out yesterday in caucus that that wasn’t going to be,” Manchin added.
The draft decision has supercharged the fight over abortion on Capitol Hill, with Democrats pledging to use it as a key midterm issue.
The bill also broadly would prevent governments from enacting any law that would create similar limits or that “singles out the provision of abortion services, health care providers who provide abortion services, or facilities in which abortion services are provided” and “impedes access to abortion services.”

     Summary: Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., will be opposing a Democratic abortion bill when it is up for a procedural vote Wednesday afternoon, stating that it is too broad for his liking.
AMERICANS SAY ECONOMY, ROE V. WADE DECISION TOP VOTING MOTIVATIONS AS MIDTERMS APPROACH"I was hopeful that the Democratic Party having control of the agenda would put a piece of legislation forward that would codify Roe v. Wade," Manchin said, stating that 70% of the American people want this.
The bill we have today to vote on, Women's Health Protection Act … make no mistake, it is not Roe v. Wade codification, it is an expansion.
But I would vote for Roe v. Wade codification if it was today, I was hopeful for that.
I believe strongly in my religion," while adding that he does believe in exceptions for cases such as rape and incest, and supports abortion rights consistent with Roe v. Wade because it's been "the law of this land."

     Summary: Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, often the swing vote in an evenly-divided Senate, announced he would oppose his fellow Democrats’ legislation to protect abortion rights, but said he’d vote to codify Roe v Wade.
Mr Manchin told reporters on Wednesday that he would oppose the legislation, called the Women’s Health Protection Act.
“We’re going to be voting on a piece of legislation which I will not vote for today,” he said.
“But I would vote for a Roe v Wade codification it was today.

     Joe Manchin Votes Against Protecting Abortion Rights Despite Claiming To Support Abortion Rights
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Schumer warned of an “open season” on Americans' “god given freedoms,” should the Supreme Court overturn Roe without any Congressional action.
The anticipated ruling, which breaks with 50 years of precedent, would constitute a dramatic rollback of reproductive rights in America and throw the security of other settled law, including marriage equality, into question.
Democrats have joined with reproductive rights advocates in decrying the expected decision, but have struggled to come up with anything they can do about it on the federal level.
Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic caucus chair, said before the vote Wednesday that lawmakers would “fight” and “win” to protect the freedom of choice against a “runaway Supreme Court.” How?
With the current makeup of the Senate and the Supreme Court, that much is unclear for now.

     Putting Joe Manchin on the Record Over Abortion Won't Hurt Him With Voters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer saw the vote as an opportunity to get the Republicans on the record regarding abortion rights.
The public will not forget which side of the vote senators fall on today," Schumer said from the Senate floor.
Joining all 50 GOP senators on Wednesday, Manchin broke with his party and voted against the legislation, despite his public support for abortion access.
Earlier in the day, Manchin told CNN's Manu Raju that while he supports the codification of Roe, Blumenthal's Women's Health Protection Act was too broad.
"The bill we have today to vote on, the Women's Health Protection Act...it is not Roe v. Wade codification, it's an expansion."

     Summary: Joe Manchin said he will vote against moving forward on Democrats' bill to codify federal abortion rights.
Democrats have renewed focus on abortion rights in the wake of a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion.
Casey, who has at times supported abortion restrictions, said that the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion overturning abortion rights had changed his mind.
In February, Casey voted to allow debate on the bill but said he was opposed to the underlying legislation.
Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who support abortion rights, but have argued for more narrowly tailored legislation.

     Manchin TANKS his Dems' effort to codify Roe v. Wade as Schumer attempt to shut down filibuster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joe Manchin has essentially killed Democrats' efforts to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law as his party prepares to bring a vote on abortion legislation Wednesday afternoon.
'But I would vote for a Roe v. Wade codification if it was today – I was hopeful for that,' the West Virginia Democrat assured.
The most recent, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, is a Mississippi case that would ban abortion after 15 weeks into a pregnancy.
This is the case that made its way to the Supreme Court and led to the draft opinion by conservative Justice Samuel Alito that would entirely overturn Roe v. Wade.
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is the only conservative of six to dissent with liberals, according to the leak earlier this month from Politico.
