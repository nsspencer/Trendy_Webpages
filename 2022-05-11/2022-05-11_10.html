     ‘Operation Mincemeat’ Review: A Bland Hash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hundreds of thousands of British soldiers died fighting in World War II.
“Operation Mincemeat,” directed by John Madden, tells the real-life story of one man drafted into the war effort after death — or rather, it tells the story of the men who conscripted him.
In this bizarrely celebratory tale, the titular “mincemeat” is a troubling figure, weighing heavy on the conscience as the men who’ve enlisted him engage in petty infighting.
Colin Firth plays Ewen Montagu, a former barrister who teams up with Charles Cholmondeley, played by Matthew Macfadyen, after hearing his plan to deceive Hitler by using forged papers attached to a corpse.
They’re aided by two girls Friday: Hester, Montagu’s steadfast “spinster” secretary played by Penelope Wilton, and Jean, a younger typist played by Kelly Macdonald.

     'Operation Mincemeat' serves up a delicious true tale of World War II espionage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) With the added bonus of dueling Mr. Darcys for "Pride and Prejudice" aficionados, "Operation Mincemeat" unites Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen in an extraordinary true story of World War II espionage, built around Winston Churchill's statement that in war, truth should be accompanied by "a bodyguard of lies."
Here, the deception hinges on a corpse, with thousands of lives hanging in the balance.
Exceptionally well cast and directed by John Madden ("Shakespeare in Love"), this handsome British production bogs down a bit in the personal lives of those responsible for the elaborate codenamed scheme, designed to convince Hitler that an allied invasion would be coming by way of Greece, not Sicily.
The steps leading to that prove alternately comical and outlandish, such as the organizers staring intently at someone who just might pass, in a photo, for their corpse.
(For his part, Churchill defines the stakes, observing, "The more fantastic, the more foolproof the plan must be.")

     Operation Mincemeat movie review (2022)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Operation Mincemeat” also serves as a bit of a James Bond origin story.
One of the British intelligence officers behind this unlikely plan was Ian Fleming, who would go on to create the iconic 007 character based on his own experiences working in espionage.
So if you ever wondered about the inspiration behind such legendary figures as M and Q, you’re in for some amusing enlightenment.
And as is the case in any great heist movie, much of the fun comes from watching the players work through their plan.
They’re both great.

     Fact-checking Netflix's 'Operation Mincemeat': Was James Bond's creator really involved?

     Summary: This story contains plot details about the World War II movie "Operation Mincemeat" (streaming now on Netflix).
And then along comes “Operation Mincemeat,” which makes, well, just that of this notion.
Was James Bond creator Ian Fleming really part of the plan?
Ian Fleming was indeed part of “Operation Mincemeat” in his post as the assistant to Britain’s director of naval intelligence, Rear Admiral John Godfrey, who also appears in the movie.
Much of “Operation Mincemeat” revolves around relationship drama between the two British officers and a co-worker, Jean Leslie (Kelly Macdonald).

     Summary: OPERATION MINCEMEAT: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?
So Montagu heads The Twenty Committee and their main maneuver, dubbed Operation Mincemeat, because Operation Fake Dead Guy was too on-the-nose.
Operation Mincemeat would pair nicely with The Imitation Game, as both involve British buttoned-ups sweating it out in secret locales, hoping their parallel spy-game/shadow-war maneuvers are successful.
Our Take: There’s a conspicuous sense that all parties involved with Operation Mincemeat have so crisply honed their skills with this type of material that they could execute it in their sleep.
Operation Mincemeat gets the job done respectably.

     What’s Fact and What’s Fiction in Operation Mincemeat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Operation Mincemeat, available on Netflix as of Wednesday, tells the story of the most successful trick Britain played during World War II.
The real Godfrey was sent to India midway through Mincemeat planning, replaced by someone less damned cussed.
Macfayden’s character mentions that his gangly frame has grounded him, and makes no secret that managing Operation Mincemeat is his one chance at heroism.
So the coordinating office above the Twenty Committee held off telling the actual Churchill about the impending Operation Mincemeat until the last moment, two weeks before its launch.
It’s the filmmakers’ role to convince the audience that the stakes of Operation Mincemeat were incredibly high.
