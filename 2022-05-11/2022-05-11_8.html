     The Tampa Bay Lightning are in Unfamiliar Territory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tampa Bay Lightning find themselves on the brink of elimination, something they didn't have to deal with much during the two Stanley Cup runs.
The Tampa Bay Lightning were a loss away from missing the Cup final a year ago, but won two straight to force a championship meeting with the Montreal Canadiens en route to a second Stanley Cup.
But at 5-on-5, the Leafs have found ways to thrive, and Tampa Bay has been prone to lapses in their own zone and allowing the Leafs to fight back.
"It's a tough series, those guys are good over there," Tampa Bay Lightning captain Steven Stamkos said.
If any team can come back from a situation like this, it's Tampa Bay.

     Morning After Thoughts: Inexcusable loss for a team looking to elevate their legacy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pittsburgh would be the following organization in line, and after that, there’d be the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Los Angeles Kings.
Tampa Bay is already a part of that pantheon of greatness; however, the desire to be the pinnacle of that pantheon is tantalizing, salivating, and near suffocating.
That is the weight Tampa Bay carries this postseason; coupled with a good but not great roster magnifies losses this time of year.
That’s why Tuesday night’s inexcusable Game Five loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs gnaws at a Lightning fan’s mind.
Being the “little brother” for so long eventually leads to a comeuppance, and this Toronto team is too talented to be taken lightly.

     Summary: While the playoffs usually see a significant decrease in penalties, five-on-five playing time has been at times hard to come by in the first-round series between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Tampa Bay Lightning.
Tuesday's Game 4 saw 11 power-play opportunities between the two teams and brought the series total to 52 power-play opportunities through five games.
"It feels like preseason," Lightning forward Patrick Maroon said Wednesday of the officiating standard being enforced.
Pat Maroon on the officiating standard for #Leafs-#Bolts:"It feels like pre-season."
Both teams were limited to one power-play goal for the third straight contest in Game 5, which pushed the back-to-back champion Lightning to the brink of elimination.
