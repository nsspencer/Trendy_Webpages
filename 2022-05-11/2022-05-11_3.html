     New inflation data is out—here's what it says about the state of the U.S. economy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At last, consumers are starting to see some relief: The rate of inflation for consumer prices declined in April, according to highly-anticipated Labor Department data published Wednesday.
The overall year-over-year price of consumer goods and services is now 8.3%, a 0.2% drop from March's 40-year high, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI).
That's a slightly slower deceleration than some observers expected: Ahead of the Labor Department's data release, 52 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected an median estimated inflation rate of 8.1%.
The CPI numbers suggest that despite recent gas price surges, there are limits to how quickly those prices can grow.
Meanwhile, core inflation — which excludes typically volatile food and gas prices — doubled last month, going from 0.3% in March to 0.6% in April.

     Consumer Prices Are Still Climbing Rapidly
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Annual inflation moderated for the first time in months in April, but the Consumer Price Index still increased 8.3 percent, an uncomfortably rapid pace.
At the same time, a closely watched measure that subtracts food and fuel costs actually accelerated.
Core inflation — which excludes costs for groceries and gas — picked up 0.6 percent in April from the prior month, faster than its 0.3 percent increase in March.
That measure is particularly important for policymakers, who use it as a gauge to help determine where inflation is headed.
While the letup in annual inflation may have given President Biden and the Fed a dose of comfort, the overall picture remains worrying.

     US inflation rate slows but remains close to 40-year high
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Price rises slowed in the US in April but the annual inflation rate remained close to a 40-year high, leaving many Americans struggling to afford necessities including food, shelter and fuel.
At 8.3% the annual rate of inflation in April was down from 8.5% in March but remains at a level unseen since the 1980s.
The pace of rate rises, and fears that they may trigger a recession, have spooked investors and sent stock markets reeling.
Soaring demand and a lack of supply thanks to the pandemic have led to price rises across a broad swath of goods and services.
Republicans have blamed Biden’s stimulus programs for rising prices, a claim he disputes.

     Summary: Inflation may be easing — but low-income people are still paying the steepest pricesEnlarge this image toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty ImagesFour-dollar gasoline and five-dollar hamburger are putting a squeeze on Tanya Byron's pocketbook.
That's a modest decrease from the March inflation rate of 8.5%, thanks in part to a short-lived drop in gasoline prices last month.
Gas prices have since rebounded to a record high, though unadjusted for inflation.
"What people are paying for similar items at different stores is very important for understanding inflation inequality," Sichel says.
Biden, whose approval ratings have fallen as prices climb, calls fighting inflation his top domestic priority.

     US inflation dips from 4-decade high but still causing pain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even if it moderates, inflation will likely remain high well into 2023, economists say, leaving many Americans burdened by price increases that have outpaced pay raises.
Especially hurt are lower-income and Black and Hispanic families, who on average spend a greater proportion of their incomes on gas, food and rent.
In April, a fallback in gas prices helped slow overall inflation.
But since then, gas prices have surged to a record $4.40 a gallon.
Food prices rose 1% from March to April and nearly 11% from a year ago.

     Summary: Food banks across America say those economic conditions are intensifying demand for their support at a time when their labor and distribution costs are climbing and donations are slowing.
For many families like the Nunamakers, food insecurity became a painful surprise.
The pandemic forced roughly 60 million Americans to seek help for food insecurity, according to Feeding America.
At the end of 2021, as hiring boomed, demand for food banks returned to regular levels.
“So we are working extra hard to reach people who have the deepest food insecurity rates.

     Stocks stagger higher after mixed report on April inflation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wall Street has been transfixed on the nation's high inflation, and where it's heading, because it's causing the Federal Reserve to yank the supports it propped under markets for most of the pandemic.
The Fed has flipped aggressively toward raising interest rates after seeing high inflation last longer than it expected.
Even if it’s deft enough to avoid a downturn, higher rates push down on prices for stocks and all kinds of investments in the meantime.
Higher rates are most hurting the investments that were the biggest winners of the ultra-low rates of the pandemic.
The war in Ukraine, meanwhile, is threatening to keep inflation high because of disruptions to the oil and natural gas markets.

     Summary: By contrast, March prices rose 8.5 percent compared with the previous year, and a sharper 1.2 percent compared with the previous month.
Advertisement“While it is heartening to see that annual inflation moderated in April, the fact remains that inflation is unacceptably high,” President Biden said in a statement Wednesday.
The food index increased 0.9 percent in April compared with March, notching its 17th consecutive monthly increase.
Fed officials often look to core inflation to understand how inflation is behaving across the entire economy.
The shelter serves about 800 men, women and children every day, and its food costs are projected to double this year.

     Summary: The inflation rate was little changed from March to April, a potential sign that the rapid growth in the cost of goods and services may soon taper off.
Compared with one year ago, the inflation rate grew by 8.3 percent in April.
The numbers indicate that inflation, which has been sitting at a 40-year high since December, is showing signs of cooling off.
The Fed has indicated that 0.75 percent interest rate hikes are not being actively considered.
"Fed officials will remain cautious, because they know the decline in inflation will slow in the third quarter," Shepherdson said.

     Summary: - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised the benchmark lending rate by a half percentage point in its ongoing effort to contain the highest inflation in four decades.
Without food and energy prices, core inflation rose 0.6%, more than the 0.3% advance in the prior month.
“Lower gasoline prices offered some reprieve to inflation this month,” said House and Pugliese.
Food prices rose 0.9% last month and 9.4% year over year, the biggest jump since April 1981.
However, energy prices fell in April as gasoline prices came down from their March peak.
