     Summary: Chelsea are set to unveil a £20 million-a-year shirt deal with cryptocurrency group WhaleFin, it has been revealed.
It was previously reported that current sleeve sponsor Hyundai were set to consider their partnership with Chelsea due to Roman Abramovich's sanctioning.
But now, as Chelsea are set to be taken over by Todd Boehly, Mark Kleinman reports that the Blues are set to unveil a new sleeve sponsorship.
IMAGO / Pro Sports ImagesThe report states that Chelsea have agreed a shirt-sleeve contract with WhaleFin, a digital asset platform owned by Singapore-based Amber Group.
WhaleFin have also struck a deal with Atletico Madrid as they enter the football advertising world.

     Christian Pulisic Caps Impressive Chelsea Sequence With Goal vs. Leeds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It may have been a rocky week for Christian Pulisic at Chelsea, but it’s nothing that scoring can’t fix.
Pulisic’s goal was both a product of an early red card to Leeds winger Daniel James and Chelsea’s impressive buildup play.
With Leeds down a man and backed into its own half, Chelsea completed eight passes, switching the field before attacking through the center.
Pulisic then switched the ball onto his left and unleashed a low curling shot into the bottom corner of the net for his sixth Premier League goal of the season.
His goal Wednesday was his first since April 24, when he scored a 90th-minute match-winner vs. West Ham.

     Chelsea consolidate top-four place as Leeds sink deeper into trouble
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mason Mount opened the scoring in the early stages at Elland Road and Leeds suffered another blow when Daniel James was sent off.
Christian Pulisic bagged Chelsea's second goal after half-time and Romelu Lukaku wrapped up the Blues' first win in four games.
Arresting their worrying recent slump was the ideal preparation for Chelsea ahead of Saturday's FA Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley.
While Chelsea look to end the season on a high, Leeds are in grave danger of relegation.
James was the second Leeds player to be shown a straight red card in successive matches following Luke Ayling's dismissal at Arsenal.

     Summary: LEEDS, England, May 11 (Reuters) - Leeds United edged closer to Premier League relegation after goals from Mason Mount, Christian Pulisic and Romelu Lukaku earned Chelsea a comfortable 3-0 victory over the 10-man hosts on Wednesday.
Coming into the match, Leeds had conceded 34 home league goals this season, their most in the top-flight in a single campaign since 1959-60.
The fourth-minute goal was the earliest Leeds have conceded in a Premier League match since December 2020.
Chelsea went ahead 2-0 when Mount flicked the ball into Pulisic, who was left free to pick his spot.
"But at the same time the level of focus has to stay high as Leeds will never stop fighting.

The 18-year-old has made his first appearances for the Blues this season, with his debut coming against Brentford in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals in December.
He has since played further games against the likes of Tottenham Hotspur, as well as featuring for the U23's.
IMAGO / SportimageIn an interview with The Athletic, Vale's mother Collette has revealed that the forward has received support from some of the club's more senior players since he began to feature in the first team.
All the players are great with him too… Reece James, Mason Mount, Kai Havertz; all so welcoming.

You need to be disciplined because Leeds never stop running.”Mason Mount gives Chelsea an early lead.
Leeds could, and perhaps should, have been more than one goal behind by half-time but the result was decided by James’s shocking tackle.
But Chelsea deserve credit for the manner in which they handled a rumbustious home crowd and a potentially tricky evening’s work.
The third goal always felt inevitable but after a slew of missed chances it took until the final seven minutes to arrive.

     Chelsea getting lucrative new sleeve sponsor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea are set to announce a new £20M-a-year sleeve sponsor in cryptocurrency group WhaleFin and are also "considering replacing Three as the club’s main shirt sponsor."
WhaleFin, owned by Singapore-based Amber Group, will "replace Hyundai, who suspended their sponsorship deal after Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK Government."
The deal, which was agreed "at the start of the year ahead of sanctions being imposed on Abramovich, is a considerable increase on the Hyundai deal that was worth £50M over four years."
With only one year remaining on the main shirt deal with British telecom Three, which also suspended its sponsorship, Chelsea has "already started the process of looking at potential alternative sponsors."
This marks WhaleFin's second major deal after becoming Atletico Madrid's main shirt sponsor earlier this year (SBJ).
