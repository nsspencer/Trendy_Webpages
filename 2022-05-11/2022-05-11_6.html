     Chelsea Land £20M-a-Year Sleeve Sponsorship Deal With Cryptocurrency Group WhaleFin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea are set to unveil a £20 million-a-year shirt deal with cryptocurrency group WhaleFin, it has been revealed.
It was previously reported that current sleeve sponsor Hyundai were set to consider their partnership with Chelsea due to Roman Abramovich's sanctioning.
But now, as Chelsea are set to be taken over by Todd Boehly, Mark Kleinman reports that the Blues are set to unveil a new sleeve sponsorship.
IMAGO / Pro Sports ImagesThe report states that Chelsea have agreed a shirt-sleeve contract with WhaleFin, a digital asset platform owned by Singapore-based Amber Group.
WhaleFin have also struck a deal with Atletico Madrid as they enter the football advertising world.

     Christian Pulisic Caps Impressive Chelsea Sequence With Goal vs. Leeds
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It may have been a rocky week for Christian Pulisic at Chelsea, but it’s nothing that scoring can’t fix.
Pulisic’s goal was both a product of an early red card to Leeds winger Daniel James and Chelsea’s impressive buildup play.
With Leeds down a man and backed into its own half, Chelsea completed eight passes, switching the field before attacking through the center.
Pulisic then switched the ball onto his left and unleashed a low curling shot into the bottom corner of the net for his sixth Premier League goal of the season.
His goal Wednesday was his first since April 24, when he scored a 90th-minute match-winner vs. West Ham.

     Summary: - ESPN+ viewers' guide: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, FA Cup, moreAnd with less than 72 hours to recover before facing Liverpool on Saturday (stream live on ESPN+ at 11:45 a.m.
ET), Tuchel said that Kovacic is unlikely to be fit in time to play against Jurgen Klopp's team.
"I tell you not as a coach and not as an expert, but for me it is very unlikely," Tuchel said.
"For me, I am not a doctor and we need to wait for the examinations, but it is very unlikely he can play.
"He's super, super hungry and determined and excited to play these matches and of course he is in fear he will miss it.

     Summary: Mason Mount opened the scoring in the early stages at Elland Road and Leeds suffered another blow when Daniel James was sent off.
Christian Pulisic bagged Chelsea's second goal after half-time and Romelu Lukaku wrapped up the Blues' first win in four games.
Arresting their worrying recent slump was the ideal preparation for Chelsea ahead of Saturday's FA Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley.
While Chelsea look to end the season on a high, Leeds are in grave danger of relegation.
James was the second Leeds player to be shown a straight red card in successive matches following Luke Ayling's dismissal at Arsenal.

     Summary: LEEDS, England, May 11 (Reuters) - Leeds United edged closer to Premier League relegation after goals from Mason Mount, Christian Pulisic and Romelu Lukaku earned Chelsea a comfortable 3-0 victory over the 10-man hosts on Wednesday.
Coming into the match, Leeds had conceded 34 home league goals this season, their most in the top-flight in a single campaign since 1959-60.
The fourth-minute goal was the earliest Leeds have conceded in a Premier League match since December 2020.
Chelsea went ahead 2-0 when Mount flicked the ball into Pulisic, who was left free to pick his spot.
"But at the same time the level of focus has to stay high as Leeds will never stop fighting.

     Summary: Conceding early is disastrous enough, as Leeds did on Sunday and again here when Mason Mount struck past Illan Meslier after four minutes.
You need to be disciplined because Leeds never stop running.”Mason Mount gives Chelsea an early lead.
Leeds could, and perhaps should, have been more than one goal behind by half-time but the result was decided by James’s shocking tackle.
But Chelsea deserve credit for the manner in which they handled a rumbustious home crowd and a potentially tricky evening’s work.
The third goal always felt inevitable but after a slew of missed chances it took until the final seven minutes to arrive.

     Summary: Exclusive: WhaleFin's entry into Premier League football sponsorship, through a deal with Chelsea, will, I'm told, be worth around £20m annually to the club.
The cryptocurrency group recently struck an even bigger shirt sponsorship with Atletico Madrid.
https://t.co/22pY8YK83U — Mark Kleinman (@MarkKleinmanSky) May 11, 2022According to the report, the agreement with cryptocurrency trading platform WhaleFin was actually signed back in January.
It’s due to pay us £20m for an unspecified number of years, twice the amount that Hyundai were paying during their sponsorship.
In related news, as per Matt Law of the Telegraph, we’re apparently also “considering replacements” for the similarly fleeing Three UK for the main shirt sponsorship.

     Chelsea announce cryptocurrency firm WhaleFin as new shirt sleeve sponsors in £20m-a-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea have announced cryptocurrency firm WhaleFin as their new shirt sleeve sponsors for the 2022-23 campaign.
He has partnered with fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter, Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss as well as investment firm Clearlake Capital.
And following Boehly's arrival in west London, the European champions have now confirmed a £20m-a-year deal with burgeoning group WhaleFin, who are set to replace South Korean car firm Hyundai as shirt sleeve sponsors next season.
It is also worth double the amount of their current package with Hyundai, who sealed a five-year deal worth £50million (£10million per year) with the west London club back in 2018.
In the end that proved impossible, but Chelsea are already understood to be looking at alternative sponsors despite having one year left on their deal with Three.
