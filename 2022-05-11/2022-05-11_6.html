     Summary: After Pittsburgh’s Jake Guentzel opened the scoring in the first period, Kris Letang put the Penguins on top 2-0 7:58 into the second period.
Around the 15-minute mark of the second period, the Rangers would respond with three goals in less than three minutes.
A minute later, Jacob Touba would backhand one through Penguins’ goaltender Louis Domingue to give the Rangers its first lead of the game, 3-2.
However, Pittsburgh evened things up again 13 seconds later on Guentzel’s second goal, and the two teams entered the second intermission locked at 3-3.
At 2:53 into the third period, Filip Chytil scored the only power play goal of the game to give the Rangers the lead for good; Ryan Lindgren would add an empty-netter to seal the win.

     RANGERS KNOCK CROSBY OUT WITH HEAD SHOT, BEAT PENS 5-3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Rangers went head-hunting again last night, as they have done throughout their first-round series against the Penguins, and they knocked Sidney Crosby out of the game.
Coach Mike Sullivan did not say it out loud, but he left no doubt that he believes the Rangers were deliberately targeting Crosby’s head.
Jake Guentzel says the Pens will simply have to do it without Crosby for as long as he is out.
Prior to the game last night, both goaltender Tristan Jarry and forward Rickard Rakell took part in an optional morning skate.
Rakell suffered a head injury courtesy of the Rangers in Game One.
