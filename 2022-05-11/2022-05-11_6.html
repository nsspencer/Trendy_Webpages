     Southern California fire rages through 200 acres, damaging Orange Co. homes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadA fast-moving wildfire erupted in the Southern California city of Laguna Niguel on Wednesday afternoon, local authorities said, affecting about 200 acres, damaging several homes and forcing evacuations.
Laguna Niguel is an affluent coastal city about 50 miles from Los Angeles.
The Laguna Niguel fire was the result of a combination of strong winds, dry vegetation and the steep slope of the area where the fire was first detected, Fennessy said.
Laguna Niguel Mayor Elaine Gennawey told reporters that an evacuation center had been set up, where 25 adults, two children and five pets had sought shelter.
The fire posed no immediate threat to the neighboring city of Laguna Beach, officials said.

     At least 20 homes in Orange County, California, engulfed by a fast-moving blaze as authorities urge evacuations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A rapidly moving brush fire destroyed at least 20 homes and forced emergency evacuations in Orange County, California, on Wednesday in a devastating preview of the coming fire season.
The fire in the city of Laguna Niguel started Wednesday afternoon and grew to about 200 acres as it ripped through mansions that sit along parched hillside streets in one of California's most affluent neighborhoods.
Flames swallowed entire homes and burned through to their interiors in one neighborhood, while firefighters hosed down nearby houses on the same street hoping to save them, footage from CNN affiliate KCBS/KCAL showed.
Jennifer McCoy, a Laguna Beach resident, told CNN she first noticed smoke coming from neighboring Laguna Niguel around 4:15 p.m. Less than two hours later, the smoke clouds had ballooned even larger, McCoy said.
"I walked down to the shopping center below and the smoke grew maybe two to three times what it was before," she said.
