     Summary: Android StudioOf course, the gateway to Android development has always been Android Studio, the official IDE designed to make Android app creation easier.
For starters, Google has launched a new “Google Play SDK Index” that offers public information about the versions of Android dependencies and SDKs.
Additionally, for Jetpack Compose developers, Android Studio Electric Eel includes an optional “Live Edit” feature that allows changes to your code to be reflected in emulators and previews of your app in real time.
The previous version of live editing for Jetpack Compose was limited to changing literals such as in-app text and dimensions.
This feature is powered by Google Fonts, allowing your Jetpack Compose app to have easy access to over 1000 free fonts.
