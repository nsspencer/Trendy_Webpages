Two weeks after writing about the “complex mystery” that is chronic illness on their Instagram story, the “You Should Be Sad” singer gave fans another update.
“Obviously, my health has changed a lot, you know, since I got pregnant and gave birth,” Halsey said in a May 10 Instagram story.
“I started getting really, really, really sick — and I’ve been kind of sick pretty much most of my adult life, but it started getting really bad.”After several hospitalizations for anaphylaxis and “seeing, like, 100,000 doctors,” Halsey said, they finally received some answers.
I’m really excited and really confident that I’m going to be able to do it in a way that’s like, healthy, where I can perform my best for all of you.”
