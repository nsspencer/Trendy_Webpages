     Suns’ Jones on Booker: ‘There’s no doubt he’s our MVP’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After his stellar season averaging 26.8 points per game, Booker finished fourth in voting for NBA Most Valuable Player.
Despite the league award going to Denver Nuggets big man Nikola Jokic, there’s no disputing how valuable Booker has been to the Suns success.
For Suns general manager James Jones, there’s no doubting that Booker has been Phoenix’s MVP this season.
Finding out where Booker finished in voting, Jones acknowledged that the Suns guard is finally starting to get the recognition he deserves for his play.
“He’s at practice today, he’s good to go.”The Suns are looking to be the first team to win a game on the road in the series.

     Phoenix Suns vs. Dallas Mavericks: Chippy series reaches elimination Game 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS – Phoenix’s last trip to Dallas was a disaster on multiple levels.
The Suns not only dropped Game 3 and Game 4, but Chris Paul’s mom and wife were harassed during Sunday’s loss on Mother’s Day that evened the series.
“The first quarters have been huge for us, especially from the defensive side of the ball,” Suns coach Monty Williams said.
“Get ready for the next game,” Suns wing Mikal Bridges said when asked about Donci's comments.
Biyombo and Chriss exchanged words, both were ejected from the game, but Chriss ended up running through the Suns tunnel trying to get at Biyombo.

     Suns smack down sets up a spicy Game 6 in Dallas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns are now one game away from their second straight appearance in the Western Conference Finals after blowing out the Dallas Mavericks, 110-80.
A minute and a half into the third, Mavericks’ guard Jalen Brunson cut the Suns’ lead down to 1 on a mid-range fadeaway from the left post.
This would be the Maverick's last points for over 5 full minutes as the Suns ripped off a 17-0 run and broke the game wide open.
Suns’ coach Monty Williams made adjustments to his game plan ahead of last night, but the improved efforts of the team as a whole defensively were evident as well and especially so in the second half.
Otherwise, you can bet these two teams will be back here at the Footprint Center on Sunday for Game 7.

     Home teams still perfect as Game 6 looms for Suns, Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If they can’t win Thursday’s Game 6 at American Airlines Center in Dallas (9:30 ET, ESPN), they’ll return home to the friendly confines of Footprint Center for Game 7.
“They’re an amazing team,” Mavericks superstar guard Luka Doncic said.
From the 2019-20 regular season to 2021-22, Phoenix bested the Mavs four games in a row at American Airlines Center.
Yet in the games played at American Airlines Center, the Mavericks found a way to negate Phoenix’s vaunted defense, averaging 107 points in their two victories.
“Defense, that’s what got us going,” Suns center Deandre Ayton said after Game 5.

     3 Things We Learned From Suns-Mavericks Game 5 On Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Offensively, Phoenix still struggled at times to get things clicking from three-point range, but their defense really stepped up and they played to their strengths in this game.
Game 6 of this series will be played down in Dallas on Thursday night, a game that will surely be filled with physical play.
“Hero-Ball” Triumphed Again For DallasThe reason the Dallas Mavericks won Games 3 and 4 at home, besides their high defensive effort, was because of how well they “spread the wealth” on offense.
In Game 5, Dallas once again relied too heavily on Doncic playing “hero-ball” and as a result, they got walloped by the Suns on Tuesday night.
17-0 Runs Tend To Result In A WinWhat they did in the third quarter is what allowed the Phoenix Suns to win Game 5 on Tuesday night.
