     How a Stablecoin Fueled a Crypto Crash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bitcoin has a reputation as a volatile cryptocurrency.
But losses are piling up in a corner of the crypto market that’s supposed to hold up when everything else tanks: stablecoins.
As their name implies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a fixed value, typically set at $1 per token.
The biggest ones, Tether and USD Coin, have held their dollar pegs.
But a fast-growing “algorithmic” stablecoin called TerraUSD crashed as low as 23 cents on the dollar this past week, before recovering to 72 cents.

     BVNK grabs $40 million for its crypto banking services – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cryptocurrency startup BVNK (pronounced ‘bee-vee-en-kay’) has closed a $40 million Series A funding round at a $340 million post-money valuation.
BVNK is targeting both crypto native and crypto curious companies, such as “payment companies that are being pushed to accept crypto,” Davis said.
It is both a way to collect payments in crypto and a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp for people who want to buy crypto assets.
For instance, many crypto wallets embed MoonPay in their apps so that users can buy crypto assets with a debit card.
This way, BVNK saves on card processing fees.

     Summary: Business Coinbase loses half its value in a week as crypto slumps "We really need a consistent federal framework."
Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase has lost half its value in the past week, including its biggest one-day drop ever on Wednesday, May 11, 2022, as the famously volatile crypto market weathers yet another slump.
(AP) — Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase has lost half its value in the past week, including its biggest one-day drop to date on Wednesday as the famously volatile crypto market weathers yet another slump.
Coinbase reported a $430 million net loss in the first quarter, or $1.98 per share, on declining sales and active users.
It’s unlikely those results surprised investors — shares Coinbase Global Inc. declined 43% in the four days leading up to their earnings release Tuesday.

     Summary: How big is the crypto market?
Approximately 14% of Americans were invested in digital assets as of 2021, according to University of Chicago research.
Story continues below advertisementStablecoins are mostly used to facilitate trading in other digital assets.
With more companies’ fortunes tied to the performance of crypto assets and traditional financial institutions dabbling more in the asset class, other risks are emerging, say regulators.
Still, regulators overall are divided on the size of the threat a crypto crash poses to the financial system and broader economy.

     Summary: Coinbase, the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, recently reported a quarterly loss of $430 million, a nearly 20 percent drop-off in users, and the possibility of bankruptcy—which would wipe out all its remaining users’ crypto holdings.
Bitcoin gains its value from the limited amount of coins available in its network, the number of holders, and investor confidence.
The CEO of Terra’s parent company utilized emergency reserves of Bitcoin—which the project buys to back TerraUSD in part—to try to prop the stablecoins’ value back up, to little avail.
AdvertisementRest of World reported last week that the country’s national Bitcoin wallet, Chivo, has been abandoned by Salvadorans en masse.
Back in January, the crypto market experienced its second-largest loss ever, wiping out more than $1 trillion from its networks.

     Bitcoin Falls Below $26,000, Tether Briefly Edges Down From $1 Peg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bitcoin plunged and the world’s largest stablecoin, tether, briefly edged down from its $1 peg, adding to fears of more turbulence in the cryptocurrency market.
On the other, the decoupling of TerraUSD, a stablecoin whose value was tied to $1, has sent ripples through digital assets.
Stablecoin TerraUSD has decoupled from its $1 peg in recent days, hitting 54 cents at 3 a.m.
When it fell below the peg, traders would burn the stablecoin—removing it from circulation—by exchanging TerraUSD for $1 worth of new units of Luna.
Tether has previously said that it has consciously reduced its commercial-paper holdings since its settlement with New York’s attorney general.

     Summary: “All you can do is hold your breath," Houchin’s longtime consultant, Cam Savage, said of when they learned about the ad buy.
This year, for the first time, industry executives have flooded money into federal races, spending $20 million so far, according to records and interviews.
The push comes as the Biden administration and Congress not only consider new regulations but also set funding levels for agencies that will oversee them.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said this week that financial regulators would soon release a report on the risks of cryptocurrency and other digital assets.
But at least one lawmaker has been an active participant in promoting the allure of crypto riches.
