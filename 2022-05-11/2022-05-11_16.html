     Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh shot, killed in West Bank
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was fatally shot while covering an Israeli military raid in the city of Jenin in the northern occupied West Bank on Wednesday morning.
But later Wednesday, the Israeli military backtracked from its initial claim that Abu Akleh may have been killed by Palestinian gunmen.
Driving the news: Israeli military forces entered Jenin in an operation to arrest Palestinians suspected of planning attacks against Israelis, the Israeli military said.
Palestinian officials said 51-year-old Abu Akleh and another Palestinian journalist, Ali al-Samudi, who works for al-Quds newspaper, were shot by Israeli soldiers.
A funeral is expected to take place Friday in the Beit Hanina neighborhood of East Jerusalem where Abu Akleh lived.

     Shireen Abu Akleh: US activists slam ‘impunity’ for Israeli abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Advocates say US should not allow Israel to investigate itself for killing of second American citizen this year.
Despite multiple eyewitness testimonies saying she was shot by Israeli forces, he Israeli government’s initial reaction to the killing of Abu Akleh was to blame “armed Palestinians” for shooting the journalist.
At the time, the Department of State also called for a “thorough criminal investigation and full accountability” in the case.
“The question is what happens next?” Berry told Al Jazeera.
“The tepid response by our State Department confirms what we already knew: The Biden administration couldn’t care less about Palestinian lives, whether they are Americans or not,” he told Al Jazeera.
