     Edmonton Oilers' Darnell Nurse suspended after head-butting Los Angeles Kings' Phillip Danault
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oilers defenseman Darnell Nurse has been suspended one game for head-butting Kings center Phillip Danault, the NHL announced Wednesday.
Nurse will not be available when the Edmonton tries to avoid elimination from its first-round Stanley Cup playoff series in Game 6 against Los Angeles on Thursday.
The incident between Nurse and Danault occurred late in the second period of Tuesday's Game 5.
L.A. was on the power play, and Nurse was jockeying for position with Danault in front of Oilers' netminder Mike Smith.
This is the second suspension of Nurse's career -- the other was a three-game ban in 2016 for an aggressor-rule violation against Roman Polak.

     Summary: Fortunately for the Kings, after an epic 5-4 overtime win on Tuesday night, the numbers are now on their side.
Andreas Athanasiou then doubled the Kings lead on a beautiful feed from Dustin Brown, sending the Kings into the third period with a two goal lead.
Oilers Captain began the eventful third period with a power play goal 2:50 in, cutting the Kings lead to just one.
Responding to an Oilers pushback was the Kings yet again as Adrian Kempe wasted no time sending the Kings home with a 3-2 series lead.
He also started his 90th consecutive postseason game for the Kings, surpassing Pekka Rinne for the fourth longest streak in NHL history.

     Oilers’ Nurse Suspended One Game for Headbutt on Kings’ Danault
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Edmonton Oilers defenseman Darnell Nurse has been suspended one game for headbutting Los Angeles Kings forward Phillip Danault.
After goaltender Mike Smith stopped a shot from Kings winger Adrian Kempe, the two players again converged with Nurse delivering a hard, helmeted head-butt.
This was an easy call for the NHL’s Department of Player Safety.
Based on their history, Player Safety has consistently handed out 1-2 game bans for similar plays.
Nurse has been suspended once before, earning a three-game ban for being the aggressor in an altercation back in 2016.

     Takeaways from LA Kings’ 5-4 OT win vs Edmonton Oilers in Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The LA Kings earned a hard-fought Game 5 overtime win, 5-4, on Tuesday.
Phillip Danault returned the favor on a double-minor with a power play goal, but Leon Draisaitl scored shorthanded to wipe out any impact of the Danault plan.
Draisaitl tied it up on the power play late in the game, forcing overtime.
Of the Oilers’ four goals, two were power play goals, both in the third period, from guess who?
However, they came out guns blazing in the overtime and scored the third quickest goal to start an overtime period in playoff franchise history.

     Round 1, Game 5 + EDM's Nurse suspended for Game 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was basically like a new game as overtime began and if you’ve been following along, you’d know that the Kings have started every game in this series well.
The first period has been the Kings period in each of the five games played and now, the only fourth period to date in this series has been the Kings period as well.
That momentum rolled over from line to line, with the Kings sending out the Kopitar line immediately thereafter.
No practice for the team today, as we prepare our travel home from Edmonton later on today.
Nurse will not play in Game 6 tomorrow evening, but would be eligible to return for Game 7 on Saturday, should that game be necessitated.
