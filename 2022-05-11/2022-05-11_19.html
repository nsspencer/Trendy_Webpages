     Clarence Dixon, Arizona's first execution in 8 years, is dead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dixon was sentenced to death after the murder of 21-year-old Deana Bowdoin in 1978.
Clarence Dixon, a 66-year-old Navajo man, was executed Wednesday morning by lethal injection, Arizona's first execution in eight years.
Leslie James, the older sister of the victim, Deana Bowdoin, was in federal court Monday morning as the proceedings unfolded.
44 YEARS AGO Clarence Dixon was convicted of raping and killing 21-year-old Deana Bowdoin, ASU honors student, in her Tempe apartment in 1978.
"The first lethal injection execution occurred in 1982, and that injection was botched," said Deborah Denno, a Fordham University professor who is an expert on execution methods.

     Clarence Dixon dies in Arizona’s 1st execution since 2014
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dixon’s death was announced late Wednesday morning by Frank Strada, a deputy director with Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry.
The execution appeared to track the state’s protocol, though the medical team had some difficulty finding a vein to administer the lethal drugs.
The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a last-minute delay of Dixon’s execution less than an hour before the execution began.
Shortly before he was executed with pentobarbital, Strada said Dixon declared: “The Arizona Supreme Court should follow the laws.
The process dragged on for so long that the Arizona Supreme Court convened an emergency hearing during the execution to decide whether to halt the procedure.

     Clarence Dixon: Arizona executes 1st death row inmate in nearly 8 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clarence Dixon, 66, was put to death by lethal injection at the state prison in Florence for his murder conviction in the killing of 21-year-old Arizona State University student Deana Bowdoin.
The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a last-minute delay of Dixon’s execution less than an hour before his execution began.
The death row inmate never made eye contact with the witnesses and stared up at the ceiling during his execution.
James said the process took "way too long," and said little else about Dixon's execution, opting instead to discuss her memories with her sister.
Arizona has 112 prisoners on death row.
