     Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh shot, killed in West Bank
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was fatally shot while covering an Israeli military raid in the city of Jenin in the northern occupied West Bank on Wednesday morning.
But later Wednesday, the Israeli military backtracked from its initial claim that Abu Akleh may have been killed by Palestinian gunmen.
Driving the news: Israeli military forces entered Jenin in an operation to arrest Palestinians suspected of planning attacks against Israelis, the Israeli military said.
Palestinian officials said 51-year-old Abu Akleh and another Palestinian journalist, Ali al-Samudi, who works for al-Quds newspaper, were shot by Israeli soldiers.
A funeral is expected to take place Friday in the Beit Hanina neighborhood of East Jerusalem where Abu Akleh lived.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed in West BankA prominent Palestinian-American journalist was killed in the West Bank and her network blames Israeli forces.
Shireen Abu Akleh was shot as she went to report on Israeli troops conducting a raid.
The question of who killed Abu Akleh and wounded one of her colleagues is still disputed, but her fame and her ties to the U.S. have put her death in the spotlight.
CHANG: So we'll talk about the circumstances of her death in a moment, but can you just first tell us a little more about who Shireen Abu Akleh was?
And Abu Akleh was at the scene of one of those raids early this morning to cover it.
