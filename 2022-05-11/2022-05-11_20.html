Sid hasn’t returned after this hit pic.twitter.com/iiNt58yAlk — Spittin' Chiclets (@spittinchiclets) May 12, 2022Unsurprisingly, the Pens did not provide much of an update on their captain following the game with coach Mike Sullivan simply saying Crosby was under evaluation for an upper body injury.
Coach Sullivan when asked about Trouba's hit on Crosby: "Did you see the hit?
— Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) May 12, 2022This wouldn’t be the first big open ice hit Trouba has been involved in this season, he also rocked Colorado’s Nathan MacKinnon back in December.
Trouba wasn’t suspended for either of those hits, but he does have suspension history.

     Jacob Trouba's dangerous hit up high on Sidney Crosby that took him out of Game 5 angered NHL fans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During their first-round series, the Penguins have mostly had their way with the young Rangers.
Pittsburgh did it largely thanks to the power of the one and only Sidney Crosby (nine points).
It’s New York d-man Jacob Trouba knocking out Sidney Crosby with an elbow while the two fought for the puck with about seven minutes left in the second period.
I know hockey’s a physical game, but that doesn’t mean it calls for chicken wings to the head out of the blue.
— Taylor Haase (@TaylorHaasePGH) May 12, 2022Considering Crosby’s extended history with head injuries, NHL fans did not take kindly to Trouba’s hit.
