     Joe Manchin joins Republicans opposing bill to codify Roe v. Wade because it “goes too far”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said on Wednesday that he would vote against a bill that would codify abortion rights for women.
Manchin told reporters that he was not prepared to support Democratic legislation to protect abortion rights at a federal level.
"We're going to be voting on a piece of legislation that I will not vote for today," Manchin said.
"But I would vote for a Roe v. Wade codification.
"The legislation would codify the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that gave constitutional protection to abortion rights and, crucially, prevent states from acting to remove or alter those protections in the future," The Guardian reported.

     Manchin to vote no on Dems' Roe v. Wade bill, saying it goes too far
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., will be opposing a Democratic abortion bill when it is up for a procedural vote Wednesday afternoon, stating that it is too broad for his liking.
AMERICANS SAY ECONOMY, ROE V. WADE DECISION TOP VOTING MOTIVATIONS AS MIDTERMS APPROACH"I was hopeful that the Democratic Party having control of the agenda would put a piece of legislation forward that would codify Roe v. Wade," Manchin said, stating that 70% of the American people want this.
The bill we have today to vote on, Women's Health Protection Act … make no mistake, it is not Roe v. Wade codification, it is an expansion.
But I would vote for Roe v. Wade codification if it was today, I was hopeful for that.
I believe strongly in my religion," while adding that he does believe in exceptions for cases such as rape and incest, and supports abortion rights consistent with Roe v. Wade because it's been "the law of this land."

     Manchin to oppose Democratic bill guaranteeing abortion access
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on Wednesday said he would oppose a Democratic bill to guarantee abortion access nationwide, indicating that it was too broad to get his vote.
“We’re going to be voting for a piece of legislation that I will not be voting for today,” Manchin told reporters.
I was hopeful for that, but I found out yesterday in caucus that that wasn’t going to be,” Manchin added.
The draft decision has supercharged the fight over abortion on Capitol Hill, with Democrats pledging to use it as a key midterm issue.
The bill also broadly would prevent governments from enacting any law that would create similar limits or that “singles out the provision of abortion services, health care providers who provide abortion services, or facilities in which abortion services are provided” and “impedes access to abortion services.”

     Joe Manchin Votes Against Protecting Abortion Rights Despite Claiming To Support Abortion Rights
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Schumer warned of an “open season” on Americans' “god given freedoms,” should the Supreme Court overturn Roe without any Congressional action.
The anticipated ruling, which breaks with 50 years of precedent, would constitute a dramatic rollback of reproductive rights in America and throw the security of other settled law, including marriage equality, into question.
Democrats have joined with reproductive rights advocates in decrying the expected decision, but have struggled to come up with anything they can do about it on the federal level.
Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic caucus chair, said before the vote Wednesday that lawmakers would “fight” and “win” to protect the freedom of choice against a “runaway Supreme Court.” How?
With the current makeup of the Senate and the Supreme Court, that much is unclear for now.

     Putting Joe Manchin on the Record Over Abortion Won't Hurt Him With Voters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer saw the vote as an opportunity to get the Republicans on the record regarding abortion rights.
The public will not forget which side of the vote senators fall on today," Schumer said from the Senate floor.
Joining all 50 GOP senators on Wednesday, Manchin broke with his party and voted against the legislation, despite his public support for abortion access.
Earlier in the day, Manchin told CNN's Manu Raju that while he supports the codification of Roe, Blumenthal's Women's Health Protection Act was too broad.
"The bill we have today to vote on, the Women's Health Protection Act...it is not Roe v. Wade codification, it's an expansion."

     Summary: Joe Manchin said he will vote against moving forward on Democrats' bill to codify federal abortion rights.
AdvertisementDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin told reporters on Wednesday that he'll vote against his party's bill that codifies federal abortion rights as the Supreme Court appears poised to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Casey, who has at times supported abortion restrictions, said that the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion overturning abortion rights had changed his mind.
In February, Casey voted to allow debate on the bill but said he was opposed to the underlying legislation.
Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who support abortion rights, but have argued for more narrowly tailored legislation.

     Summary: The Senate failed to advance a bill that would enshrine abortion rights in federal law.
All 50 Republican senators, along with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, opposed the bill in a 49-51 vote.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the vote as putting Republicans on the record with their opposition to abortion rights.
Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who said they support abortion rights and have offered a more limited piece of legislation to codify Roe, also voted against Wednesday's bill.
Schumer attempted to use the failed vote to draw a sharp distinction between Democrats and Republicans' stances on abortion ahead of the November elections.
