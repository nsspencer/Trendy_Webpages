     ‘Operation Mincemeat’ Review: A Bland Hash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hundreds of thousands of British soldiers died fighting in World War II.
“Operation Mincemeat,” directed by John Madden, tells the real-life story of one man drafted into the war effort after death — or rather, it tells the story of the men who conscripted him.
In this bizarrely celebratory tale, the titular “mincemeat” is a troubling figure, weighing heavy on the conscience as the men who’ve enlisted him engage in petty infighting.
Colin Firth plays Ewen Montagu, a former barrister who teams up with Charles Cholmondeley, played by Matthew Macfadyen, after hearing his plan to deceive Hitler by using forged papers attached to a corpse.
They’re aided by two girls Friday: Hester, Montagu’s steadfast “spinster” secretary played by Penelope Wilton, and Jean, a younger typist played by Kelly Macdonald.

     'Operation Mincemeat' serves up a delicious true tale of World War II espionage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) With the added bonus of dueling Mr. Darcys for "Pride and Prejudice" aficionados, "Operation Mincemeat" unites Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen in an extraordinary true story of World War II espionage, built around Winston Churchill's statement that in war, truth should be accompanied by "a bodyguard of lies."
Here, the deception hinges on a corpse, with thousands of lives hanging in the balance.
Exceptionally well cast and directed by John Madden ("Shakespeare in Love"), this handsome British production bogs down a bit in the personal lives of those responsible for the elaborate codenamed scheme, designed to convince Hitler that an allied invasion would be coming by way of Greece, not Sicily.
The steps leading to that prove alternately comical and outlandish, such as the organizers staring intently at someone who just might pass, in a photo, for their corpse.
(For his part, Churchill defines the stakes, observing, "The more fantastic, the more foolproof the plan must be.")

     ‘Operation Mincemeat’ review: How Colin Firth and company faked an invasion and helped win WWII, now on Netflix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Operation Mincemeat,” now purring along, confidently, on Netflix, takes as its subject a singular feat of deception cooked up by British intelligence in 1943.
That said: The superb Macdonald is the heartbeat of the movie, so “Operation Mincemeat” benefits from every scene she’s in.
Montagu’s brother was a Communist sympathizer and, as British intelligence brass believed (based on some evidence), he may have been spying for the Russians.
By most accounts, the idea for the real-life Operation Mincemeat came from Fleming, though his superior, Rear Admiral John Godfrey, took credit for it.
Like that film, “Operation Mincemeat” takes liberties.

     Fact-checking Netflix's 'Operation Mincemeat': Was James Bond's creator really involved?

     Summary: This story contains plot details about the World War II movie "Operation Mincemeat" (streaming now on Netflix).
And then along comes “Operation Mincemeat,” which makes, well, just that of this notion.
Was James Bond creator Ian Fleming really part of the plan?
Ian Fleming was indeed part of “Operation Mincemeat” in his post as the assistant to Britain’s director of naval intelligence, Rear Admiral John Godfrey, who also appears in the movie.
Much of “Operation Mincemeat” revolves around relationship drama between the two British officers and a co-worker, Jean Leslie (Kelly Macdonald).

    </h2>

     Summary: Read on to get a briefing on the Operation Mincemeat true story, and to see how accurate Netflix’s Operation Mincemeat is.
IS OPERATION MINCEMEAT BASED ON A TRUE STORY?
OPERATION MINCEMEAT TRUE STORY:Colin Firth’s character in Operation Mincemeat on Netflix, Ewen Montagu, was a British intelligence officer with a leading role in the military operation, which he later documented in his 1953 book, The Man Who Never Was, which was made into a movie of the same name three years later.
That makes Netflix’s Operation Mincemeat the second movie to be made about this morbidly fascinating true story.
In an interview for the Operation Mincemeat press notes, author Ben Macintyre, who wrote the book the Netflix movie is based on, explained, “The plot actually did come from fiction.

     ‘Operation Mincemeat’ Review: Colin Firth and Matthew Macfayden Star in Shocking True Story With Heartbreaking Consequences
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “In any story, if it’s a good story, there is that which is seen and that which is hidden,” begins John Madden’s intriguing and wonderfully-acted Operation Mincemeat.
Operation Mincemeat follows British Intelligence as they attempt to hide the Allied’s invasion of Sicily in 1943.
But even more captivating is the creation of an entirely new person for this operation to work.
Primarily, Montagu, Cholmondeley, and Leslie have to figure out who Major William Martin is, crafting a person out of thin air.
Madden and Ashford make Operation Mincemeat mix a shocking true story with a frequently heartbreaking story about the large toll war takes, even on those who aren’t on the frontlines.

     Operation Mincemeat Review: Colin Firth War Drama Is Diverting &amp; Forgettable
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At a time when the latest Marvel movie will be stomping its way through the box office, turning on Operation Mincemeat — the kind of star-studded, adult-oriented, mid-range drama that studios don't often greenlight anymore — might feel like an act of resistance.
Operation Mincemeat is a solid movie, the only reasonable reactions to which are mild.
Is it to frame plans like Operation Mincemeat as how the creatively inclined contributed to the war effort with maximum impact?
The film is 128 minutes long and is rated PG-13 for strong language, some sexual content, brief war violence, and smoking.
