     Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh shot, killed in West Bank
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was fatally shot while covering an Israeli military raid in the city of Jenin in the northern occupied West Bank on Wednesday morning.
But later Wednesday, the Israeli military backtracked from its initial claim that Abu Akleh may have been killed by Palestinian gunmen.
Driving the news: Israeli military forces entered Jenin in an operation to arrest Palestinians suspected of planning attacks against Israelis, the Israeli military said.
Palestinian officials said 51-year-old Abu Akleh and another Palestinian journalist, Ali al-Samudi, who works for al-Quds newspaper, were shot by Israeli soldiers.
A funeral is expected to take place Friday in the Beit Hanina neighborhood of East Jerusalem where Abu Akleh lived.

The question of who killed Abu Akleh and wounded one of her colleagues is still disputed, but her fame and her ties to the U.S. have put her death in the spotlight.
CHANG: So we'll talk about the circumstances of her death in a moment, but can you just first tell us a little more about who Shireen Abu Akleh was?

     Summary: Shireen Abu Akleh was murdered.
They said that there needed to be a “thorough investigation” into who, precisely, shot Abu Akleh in the face.
It goes like this: We will never know who shot Abu Akleh in the face.
Israel wants an “inquiry” to find out who shot Abu Akleh.
Shireen Abu Akleh knew that, I suspect, better than anyone.
