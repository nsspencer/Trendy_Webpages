Sid hasn’t returned after this hit pic.twitter.com/iiNt58yAlk — Spittin' Chiclets (@spittinchiclets) May 12, 2022Unsurprisingly, the Pens did not provide much of an update on their captain following the game with coach Mike Sullivan simply saying Crosby was under evaluation for an upper body injury.
Coach Sullivan when asked about Trouba's hit on Crosby: "Did you see the hit?
— Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) May 12, 2022This wouldn’t be the first big open ice hit Trouba has been involved in this season, he also rocked Colorado’s Nathan MacKinnon back in December.
Trouba wasn’t suspended for either of those hits, but he does have suspension history.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby left Wednesday’s playoff game during the second period because of an injury after absorbing a hit to his head.
The Penguins lost the game 5-3 but lead the best-of-seven series 3-2.
Crosby missed the second half of the 2010-11 season and roughly three-quarters of the following season because of concussion issues.
Crosby missed the first seven games of this past regular season after undergoing wrist surgery in September.
Keep up with the Pittsburgh Penguins all season long.

     Sidney Crosby knocked out of Game 5 as Penguins fall to Rangers in potential playoff series clincher
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sidney Crosby exited Wednesday night's playoff game against the New York Rangers after taking a hard hit and never returned.
The Rangers stormed back with three goals in a span of 2:42 to take a 3-2 lead in the second period.
As he normally is, Crosby was a driving force in the Penguins seizing a 3-1 series lead.
Game 6 is Friday night in Pittsburgh with the Penguins seeking their first series victory since 2018.
Verhaeghe broke the Panthers’ playoff scoring record that Ray Sheppard set on a four-point night back on April 22, 1996 – which remains the last, and only, season in which the Panthers won a playoff series.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rangers’ season seemed all but over deep into the second period Wednesday night, and then Sidney Crosby left the ice a few minutes after he took a Jacob Trouba elbow to the head.
Trouba connected with an elbow to Crosby’s head as both were going after the puck at 9:15 of the second period.
Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan didn’t directly call it dirty, but suggested it was not aboveboard.
Sullivan and his players didn’t use Crosby’s absence as an excuse, and didn’t feel his injury contributed to the Rangers’ comeback.
“We just simply have to do a better job there.”That loose play didn’t happen when Crosby was in the game.

     Summary: (0:25)The Pittsburgh Penguins failed to close out the New York Rangers in their Game 5 loss on Wednesday night, but their attention afterward was on the loss of captain Sidney Crosby.

With Crosby sidelined, the Rangers roared back from a 2-0 deficit to take a 3-2 lead in the second period.
New York forward Filip Chytil's power-play goal in the third period broke a 3-3 tie and ended up as the game winner.
It was 2-0 Penguins at 7:58 of the second period, as Evgeni Malkin found Kris Letang for his first goal of the series.
