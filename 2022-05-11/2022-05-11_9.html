    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colby GuySpecial to The PostSUNRISE — For the first time since 2012, the Florida Panthers find themselves in the driver’s seat of a playoff round.
This came 48 hours after Verhaeghe scored two goals, including the overtime winner in Florida’s 3-2 Game 4 victory.
He leads all Panthers skaters in goals (5) and points (10) through the first five games of the postseason.
They will try to win a playoff series for the first time since their Eastern Conference Final in 1996.
With history on the line, the Panthers are just focused on being prepared for what comes ahead in Game 6.

     Round 1 | Game 5: Florida Panthers 5, Washington Captials 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE — The Florida Panthers certainly lived up to their ‘Comeback Cats’ moniker in their previous outing, but who could have guessed they would do it again on Wednesday night?
Another Florida comeback started not long after the sarcastic pleading came down from on high, the Panthers scoring three of their own to close the second period.
In the third, Florida got a second Verhaeghe goal and pulled out a 5-3 win over the Washington Capitals in Game 5 of their first-round series.
Florida, for the first time since Jonathan Huberdeau scored early in Game 3, had a lead in regulation.
Later in the game — after playing Pepas — the Panthers finally got to take a deep breath and enjoy Mambo No.

     Summary: dsantiago@miamiherald.comThe building was ready to explode — it always is for this never-say-die Florida Panthers — and the Panthers just wanted one bounce to go their way.
The Washington Capitals — battle tested, but still a No.
Florida hasn’t won a postseason series since it reached the 1996 Stanley Cup Finals in just its third season of existence.
With two goals in 1:25, Washington went up 3-0 with 16:22 left in the second period.
Chaos around Washington’s goal left a puck on the doorstep for Reinhart, who came from behind the net and knocked in the game-tying goal with 5:19 left in the second.

     Summary: SUNRISE — The Florida Panthers gave Carter Verhaeghe a nickname that sort of did not fit.
After the past couple games Carter Verhaeghe has had, coach Andrew Brunette has struggled to keep a straight face when talking about his red-hot winger.
He is the same Carter, the ‘Swaggy’ we always get but he is getting rewarded for it.”Verhaeghe had perhaps one of the greatest nights in Florida Panthers’ history on Wednesday.
Unbelievable player for us.”On Monday night, Verhaeghe did not want to talk about his individual accolades.
Come Friday night, the Panthers can win their first playoff series since 1996.

     Carter Verhaeghe’s big night leads Panthers to comeback win over Capitals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SUNRISE, Fla. — Carter Verhaeghe was brought to the Florida Panthers for big postseason moments.
Florida erased a 3-0 deficit to beat the Washington Capitals 5-3 on Wednesday night, taking a 3-2 lead in the teams’ Eastern Conference first-round series.
The Panthers’ Carter Verhaeghe scores on Ilya Samsonov to take the lead in the third period.
Verhaeghe gave the Panthers the lead to stay at 3:04 of the third, after a pair of marvelous plays at both ends.
Florida’s rally matched the largest in an NHL playoff game since April 19, 2011, when the San Jose Sharks erased a four-goal deficit to beat the Los Angeles Kings 6-5.
