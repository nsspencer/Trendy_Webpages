     Summary: Watch Kevin De Bruyne Score His First Man City Hat-Trick (All With His Left Foot) At WolvesKevin De Bruyne proved just why he is Manchester City's highest-earner on Wednesday by scoring a brilliant hat-trick against Wolves.
But De Bruyne reminded everyone why he is currently City's main man by netting on seven, 16 and 24 minutes at Molineux.
All three of De Bruyne's goals were scored with his left foot, which is supposedly his weaker foot.
His second was less aesthetically pleasing but he showed impressive anticipation to pounce upon an error by Wolves keeper Jose Sa.
De Bruyne scored again in the second half, albeit this time with his right foot, as City cruised to a 5-1 victory over Wolves to move three points clear of Premier League title rivals Liverpool.

     Wolves vs Manchester City LIVE: Premier League latest score and goal updates after Kevin De Bruyne nets rapid hat-trick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‚úï Close Pep: 'Final final against Wolves massively, massively important'Kevin De Bruyne scored four goals as Manchester City restored a three-point lead at the Premier League summit with a 5-1 win at Wolves.
The playmaker rattled in a left-footed hat-trick inside the opening 24 minutes and added another on the hour as City demonstrated the firepower they have even before Erling Haaland arrives next season.
City‚Äôs victory was also an emphatic response to title rivals Liverpool‚Äôs success over Aston Villa the previous night and tightened their grip on the title race with just two games to play.
The De Bruyne show was briefly interrupted by a Leander Dendoncker strike early on but a late Raheem Sterling tap-in ensured they would score five for a second successive game.
With the extra insurance of a goal difference now plus seven better than their Merseyside rivals, City are closing in on their fourth title in five seasons.

     Wolves vs Man City: Player ratings and analysis as De Bruyne‚Äôs dazzling quadruple turns screw on Liverpool
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City‚Äôs Belgian star marked his first ever hat-trick for the club by mimicking the Norwegian striker‚Äôs goal celebration, a neat tribute the day after the club confirmed his ¬£51.1m signing.
The goal came from a City attack as the hosts broke upfield through Raul Jimenez and Pedro Neto‚Äôs cross picked out Leander Dendoncker for a cool finish.
With City using 37-year-old midfielder Fernandinho as an emergency centre-half, the leaders looked under pressure but De Bruyne‚Äôs magnificent composure, and some poor Wolves marking, ensured Guardiola edged closer to the title.
De Bruyne started the move for the seventh minute opener, playing a skilful one-two with Bernardo Silva and racing through to leave Jose Sa with no chance in the Wolves goal.
The pick of the bunch was De Bruyne‚Äôs hat-trick goal as Sterling and Rayan Ait-Nourri wrestled for possession.
