     Summary: As if crypto investors don’t already have enough to worry about, Coinbase Global (ticker: COIN) in its 10-Q said customers could lose their crypto in bankruptcy proceedings were the firm ever to go under.
In essence, customers might only get their crypto back after the platform had paid off other, more senior, creditors, according to the disclosure.
If the firm were in a big enough hole, a customer could lose everything.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The past several days have been trying times for crypto investors as a broader market pullback has wreaked havoc on token prices.
The Solana token now sits around $52, a near 80% decline from its November all-time-high of $260.
As broader market uncertainty is pushing investors across the board to minimize risk, emerging crypto networks are finding themselves in a tough position.
The question investors are asking is whether Solana’s developer ecosystem has matured enough to weather a potential crypto winter.
In a tweet Wednesday, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko gave advice to others in the crypto space, “[B]eing a founder means building with fanatical conviction, through the ups and downs.

     Summary: Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, released its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday and included a new disclosure to customers.
It suggests the customers' cryptocurrency could be at risk if the exchange ever went bankrupt.
"Your funds are safe at Coinbase, just as they've always been," Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, tweeted Wednesday.
This could mean, in the case of bankruptcy proceedings, that customers' balances might be considered Coinbase property, according to Business Insider.
Armstrong tweeted that Coinbase does have its own crypto wallet for those who'd rather hold onto their cryptocurrency than leave it with the exchange.

     Summary: Coinbase, the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, recently reported a quarterly loss of $430 million, a nearly 20 percent drop-off in users, and the possibility of bankruptcy—which would wipe out all its remaining users’ crypto holdings.
Bitcoin gains its value from the limited amount of coins available in its network, the number of holders, and investor confidence.
The CEO of Terra’s parent company utilized emergency reserves of Bitcoin—which the project buys to back TerraUSD in part—to try to prop the stablecoins’ value back up, to little avail.
AdvertisementRest of World reported last week that the country’s national Bitcoin wallet, Chivo, has been abandoned by Salvadorans en masse.
Back in January, the crypto market experienced its second-largest loss ever, wiping out more than $1 trillion from its networks.

     Coinbase Says Users’ Crypto Assets Lack Bankruptcy Protections
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cryptocurrency trading platforms might look and feel like regular brokerage apps to everyday users, but regulators have long warned they lack the oversight and investor protections that are built into traditional financial services.
In its quarterly filings, the crypto trading firm suggested that the digital tokens it holds for its users might not really belong to them if push comes to shove.
“Because custodially held crypto assets may be considered to be the property of a bankruptcy estate, in the event of a bankruptcy, the crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings, and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors,” the company said.
By contrast, securities held for customers by a registered brokerage are legally segregated from the assets of the brokerage, meaning they can’t be touched in bankruptcy proceedings.
Those guidelines directed publicly traded cryptocurrency trading platforms to report users’ assets on their own balance sheets.
