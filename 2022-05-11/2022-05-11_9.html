     Wolves vs Man City: Player ratings and analysis as De Bruyne‚Äôs dazzling quadruple turns screw on Liverpool
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City‚Äôs Belgian star marked his first ever hat-trick for the club by mimicking the Norwegian striker‚Äôs goal celebration, a neat tribute the day after the club confirmed his ¬£51.1m signing.
The goal came from a City attack as the hosts broke upfield through Raul Jimenez and Pedro Neto‚Äôs cross picked out Leander Dendoncker for a cool finish.
With City using 37-year-old midfielder Fernandinho as an emergency centre-half, the leaders looked under pressure but De Bruyne‚Äôs magnificent composure, and some poor Wolves marking, ensured Guardiola edged closer to the title.
De Bruyne started the move for the seventh minute opener, playing a skilful one-two with Bernardo Silva and racing through to leave Jose Sa with no chance in the Wolves goal.
The pick of the bunch was De Bruyne‚Äôs hat-trick goal as Sterling and Rayan Ait-Nourri wrestled for possession.
