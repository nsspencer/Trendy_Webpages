     Trump's pick for Nebraska governor loses in GOP primary, signaling limits to former president's influence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charles Herbster Nebraska gubernatorial candidate speaks during the fourth day of the Conservative Political Action Conference CPAC on Sunday, Feb. 27, 2022 in Orlando, FL.
Former President Donald Trump's preferred candidate is projected to lose Nebraska's GOP gubernatorial primary, signaling that Trump's influence in the party has its limits — even in Republican stronghold states.
University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen smiles to applause as he is named the winner of the Nebraska Republican gubernatorial primary during an election night party at the Embassy Suites on Tuesday, May 10, 2022, in Lincoln, Neb.
Herbster, a first-time gubernatorial candidate who poured millions into his campaign, has denied the allegations made by eight women, including a Republican state senator.
Nebraska's GOP primary was an uncommonly competitive three-way fight between Herbster, Pillen and state Sen. Brett Lindstrom.

     Trump Candidate Loses in Nebraska, Wins in West Virginia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While Trump-endorsed candidates won primary races in West Virginia for the U.S. House on Tuesday, the statewide loss in Nebraska was a setback for Trump.
In this Republican stronghold, Pillen will be a favorite in November’s general election against his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Carol Blood.
In Nebraska, the allegations against Herbster, a longtime supporter of Trump, didn’t stop the former president from holding a rally with him earlier this month.
State Sen. Mike Flood, a former speaker of the Nebraska Legislature, won the Republican nomination, while state Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks won the Democratic nod.
Despite Trump’s loss in the Nebraska governor’s race, his influence proved decisive in West Virginia, which also held primary elections Tuesday.
