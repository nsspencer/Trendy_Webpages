     The Tampa Bay Lightning are in Unfamiliar Territory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Tampa Bay Lightning find themselves on the brink of elimination, something they didn't have to deal with much during the two Stanley Cup runs.
The Tampa Bay Lightning were a loss away from missing the Cup final a year ago, but won two straight to force a championship meeting with the Montreal Canadiens en route to a second Stanley Cup.
But at 5-on-5, the Leafs have found ways to thrive, and Tampa Bay has been prone to lapses in their own zone and allowing the Leafs to fight back.
"It's a tough series, those guys are good over there," Tampa Bay Lightning captain Steven Stamkos said.
If any team can come back from a situation like this, it's Tampa Bay.

     Summary: Down 3-2 in their first-round playoff series against the Maple Leafs, the Lightning face elimination on the ice where they celebrated last year’s championship.
But I’d much rather play an elimination game at home than on the road.”During their two-season Cup reign, the Lightning have controlled most of their playoff series.
“We’re facing an elimination game.
You shouldn’t be playing this sport.”The last time the Lightning faced elimination in a Game 6 was in the first round of the 2015 playoffs.
Tampa Bay held 3-2 series leads in the Eastern Conference final against Pittsburgh in 2016 and Washington in 2018 before losing.

     Morning After Thoughts: Inexcusable loss for a team looking to elevate their legacy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pittsburgh would be the following organization in line, and after that, there’d be the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Los Angeles Kings.
Tampa Bay is already a part of that pantheon of greatness; however, the desire to be the pinnacle of that pantheon is tantalizing, salivating, and near suffocating.
That is the weight Tampa Bay carries this postseason; coupled with a good but not great roster magnifies losses this time of year.
That’s why Tuesday night’s inexcusable Game Five loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs gnaws at a Lightning fan’s mind.
Being the “little brother” for so long eventually leads to a comeuppance, and this Toronto team is too talented to be taken lightly.
