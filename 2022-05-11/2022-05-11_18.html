     Video Shared by Israel Shows Palestinian Gunman Was Not Firing at Journalist Killed During Israeli Raid
    </h2>

     Summary: Warning: Graphic videoClearly depicts continued Israeli firing after Shireen Abu Akleh went down.
(@LinahAlsaafin) May 11, 2022Israel killed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh this morning while she was reporting in Jenin.
#FreePalestine — Diana Buttu (@dianabuttu) May 11, 2022In response, a chorus of senior Israeli officials insisted that it was “likely” the reporter had been killed by Palestinian militants, who exchanged fire with Israeli soldiers during the raid.
To support that case, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and the Israeli Embassy in Washington all shared video on social networks that showed a Palestinian gunman opening fire during the raid.
The IDF says it is continuing to investigate the death of Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Aqleh.

     Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh shot, killed in West Bank
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was fatally shot while covering an Israeli military raid in the city of Jenin in the northern occupied West Bank on Wednesday morning.
But later Wednesday, the Israeli military backtracked from its initial claim that Abu Akleh may have been killed by Palestinian gunmen.
Driving the news: Israeli military forces entered Jenin in an operation to arrest Palestinians suspected of planning attacks against Israelis, the Israeli military said.
Palestinian officials said 51-year-old Abu Akleh and another Palestinian journalist, Ali al-Samudi, who works for al-Quds newspaper, were shot by Israeli soldiers.
A funeral is expected to take place Friday in the Beit Hanina neighborhood of East Jerusalem where Abu Akleh lived.
