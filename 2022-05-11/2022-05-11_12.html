     Mike Tyson Won’t Be Charged After SFO Altercation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (San Bruno, CA) — No charges will be filed against former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson after an altercation at San Francisco International Airport last month.
That’s after the San Mateo County DA’s Office reviewed cell phone videos of Tyson repeatedly punching a man in the face while on a plane leaving SFO.
DA Steve Wagstaffe says the decision not to file charges is based on circumstances surrounding the confrontation, including the fact the victim was intoxicated and had thrown a bottle at the boxer.
Both men are also requesting that no charges be filed.
Tyson was in San Francisco to promote an app at 4/20 Day festivities.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Authorities will not file criminal charges against former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson after he was recorded on video punching a fellow first-class passenger aboard a plane at San Francisco International Airport last month, prosecutors announced Tuesday.
Police previously said that the victim had provided few details about the altercation and refused to cooperate with the investigation.
Since Tyson, 55, retired from boxing, he has worked as an actor, podcaster and cannabis entrepreneur.
He was in San Francisco in April for the annual 420 cannabis festival in Golden Gate Park, where he was promoting his cannabis brand Tyson 2.0, SFGate reported.
Tyson was briefly barred from boxing after infamously biting off part of Evander Holyfield’s ear during a fight in 1997.

What prompted Tyson to hit Townsend III was that this man had been bothering him throughout the trip and even threw a water bottle at him.
Following the incident, Townsend III reportedly hired a legal team to defend himself against any possible consequences.
The primary reason for not charging the former World Heavyweight Champion was the express request of both Townsend III and Tyson.
