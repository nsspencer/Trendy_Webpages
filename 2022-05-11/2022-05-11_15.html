     Toronto Blue Jays lose no-hitter, lead, pitcher and coach in one fateful inning vs. New York Yankees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the first five innings, things were going swimmingly for the Toronto Blue Jays in the opener of their two-game series in the Bronx.
Starting pitcher Yusei Kikuchi had held the New York Yankees without a hit and the Jays had built a 3-0 lead.
And several Blue Jays coaches also ran out onto the field, with pitching coach Pete Walker tossed from the game as well.
But, he added, “it wasn’t a good look.’’Montoyo remained in the game, but was ejected one inning later for arguing when a pitch from Yankees reliever Jonathan Loaisiga brushed back Jays shortstop Bo Bichette.
The walk-off homer was the first of Judge's career.

     MLB needs to suspend these two awful umps from Tuesday's Blue Jays-Yankees game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you’ve been paying attention at all to the MLB season thus far then you know the umpires have been really, really bad.
What happened in last night’s Blue Jays-Yankees game was ridiculous.
During that ejection, Blue Jays pitching coach Pete Walker got tossed, too.
Check out this embarrassing scene:Blue Jays pitcher Yimi Garcia was ejected in the sixth inning of a 3-3 ballgame vs. the Yankees for hitting Josh Donaldson.
Home plate ump Lance Barrett later ejected Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo and appeared to yell, “Boom, got ya!” while doing it.

     Blue Jays vs. Yankees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Torres followed his go-ahead, three-run homer with a two-run single and led the surging New York Yankees over the Toronto Blue Jays 5-3 Wedesday for their 15th win in 17 games.
Yankees manager Aaron Boone benched Torres for six of this season's first 25 games, including opening day, when Torres' tying sacrifice fly in the 10th helped the Yankees beat Boston.
On a sloppy day for the Blue Jays, Bo Bichette failed to advance to third on an errant pitch following his fifth-inning double.
There didn't appear to be any carryover from the Yankees' 6-5 win the previous night, a game that turned testy and saw three Blue Jays ejected.
TRAINER’S ROOMINF-OF Cavan Biggio, who hasn’t played for the Blue Jays since April 24 following a positive COVID-19 test, was 2 for 2 with a two-run single and a double as a DH for Triple-A Buffalo against Lehigh Valley on Tuesday night.
