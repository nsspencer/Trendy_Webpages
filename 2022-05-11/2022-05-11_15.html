     'Our Father' turns a fertility doctor's betrayal into a horror-movie documentary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) There have been other stories about fertility doctors who abused their positions, and even a short-lived Fox drama built around the idea.
Condensed into a documentary premiering on Netflix, "Our Father" captures the pain and betrayal associated with that, while diluting the message by shooting and scoring the production using horror-movie conventions.
Those events were set in motion by Jacoba Ballard, who was understandably shocked to discover that DNA showed she had several half-siblings.
Dr. Donald ClineThe production notes describe that as "an unimaginable breach of trust," a message that comes through loud and clear.
(The fact that horror-movie factory Blumhouse is behind the project is unfortunately evident.)

     Where Is Donald Cline Now? The Doctor From Netflix’s ‘Our Father’ Doc Still Lives Free
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Perhaps that wasn’t saying much, considering that fertility doctors were still a fairly new phenomenon when Cline opened his specialty practice in 1979.
Still, for three decades, Cline helped hundreds of parents who had problems conceiving get pregnant.
Dr. Donald Cline is still living as a free man in Indianapolis, Indiana according to a 2019 report from The Atlantic.
He lives within just a few blocks of some of the children he fathered without their mother’s consent.
One of his former patients interviewed for the Atlantic story, Liz White, told the magazine the former doctor “lives down the street over there.

     "Our Father": the 5 creepiest moments from Netflix's harrowing fertility fraud documentary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix's latest documentary feature "Our Father" is an intricate real-life horror tale about fertility fraud that manages to grow more unsettling by the minute.
2 Liz White's storyWhite, the mother of Ballard's fellow half-sibling Matt White, visited Cline's office frequently when she was trying for a child despite her struggles with infertility.
Cline's office was also littered with Christian sayings, such as, "If you want to get to Heaven, you need to be Christian."
The scripture, which is found at the opening of the documentary, was also found in Cline's office and previously given to Ballard when they first met in person.
Additionally, it is believed that the Quiverfull movement advocates for more white children to help uphold white supremacy ideals and preserve the white race over others.

     'Our Father' on Netflix: Lingering Questions From the Documentary Answered
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Weeks ago, a viral tweet introduced me to Our Father, a Netflix documentary.
Our Father hit Netflix on Wednesday, chock full of twists, emotionally wrenching interviews and more sort-of-distracting reenactments than I thought there'd be.
Lucie Jourdan makes her directorial documentary debut with the film, which comes from Netflix and Blumhouse Pictures.
Here are answers to the major questions I had after watching Our Father.
QuiverfullIn the film, Ballard draws a link between Cline and Quiverfull, the conservative Christian movement I mentioned earlier, but it's not a strong one.
