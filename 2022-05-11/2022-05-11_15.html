     Why Mandy Moore Threw Up After Reading This Is Us' Next Episode
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch : The Endgame's Ryan Michelle Bathe Gives This Is Us Finale ScoopIf you thought the May 10 episode of This Is Us was intense, you haven't seen anything yet.
In the latest episode of the NBC drama, the Pearson children are forced to reckon with their mother, Rebecca's, ailing health after her husband, Miguel (Jon Huertas), dies.
And while this episode was a devastating one, Mandy Moore warned Late Night host Jimmy Fallon, "You might need a day off from work" after next week's.
The actress, who plays Rebecca, added that she actually threw up after reading the script for the penultimate episode.
Plus, she added, "This character's also coincidentally saying goodbye as well, so there was a lot wrapped up in it."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No one is safe from the sheer dress.
Not even Mandy Moore.
See-through dresses are all the rage these days—Kerry Washington was one of multiple celebs, including Kate Moss’s daughter Lila, who wore sheer gowns to the 2022 Met Gala.
As series creator Dan Fogelman revealed during a panel discussion last month, “the second to last script, it made Mandy throw up.
Hopefully, not ugly throw up,” to which Moore added, “A beautiful throw up.
