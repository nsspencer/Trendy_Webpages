     Coastal fire: What homes are worth in Laguna Niguel hills where 20 homes burned
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Coastal fire has burned at least 20 homes since it swept across Aliso Woods Canyon into Laguna Niguel on Wednesday, fire officials said.
The fast-moving brush fire prompted the evacuation of area homes and a luxury resort and golf course.
Another 100 homes were potentially in the fire’s path, according to authorities.
A temporary shelter was set up at Crown Valley Community Center on Crown Valley Parkway.
According to Zillow estimates, homes in the Laguna Niguel neighborhood are worth $2.6 million to $10 million.

     At least 20 homes in Southern California engulfed by a fast-moving blaze as authorities urge evacuations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) At least 20 homes were set ablaze Wednesday in parts of the Laguna Hills area of Orange County, California, as a brush fire rapidly grew and spread to residences that were either destroyed or damaged, official said.
Flames swallowed entire homes and burned through to their interiors in one neighborhood while firefighters hosed down nearby houses on the same street hoping to save them, footage from CNN affiliate KCBS/KCAL showed.
Jennifer McCoy, a Laguna Beach resident, told CNN she first noticed smoke coming from Laguna Niguel -- approximately 8 miles away -- around 4:15 p.m. Less than two hours later, the smoke clouds had ballooned even larger, McCoy said.
A fast-moving fire consumed homes in Orange County, California, Wednesday.
"I walked down to the shopping center below and the smoke grew maybe two to three times what it was before," she said.

The fire was just getting stronger, and the smoke was getting thicker and thicker,” Kothlow said.
“I saw it hit the palm trees, and as soon as I saw that I knew those houses were gone.
