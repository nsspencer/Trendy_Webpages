     Summary: Husso started the Wild series, but Binnington got the nod in Game 4, stopping 28 shots en route to a 5-2 Blues victory.
The Wild have perhaps the most battle-tested goaltender of any playoff team in Marc-Andre Fleury.
By virtue of their playoff experience and their heavier style, the Blues seem better equipped to replicate Vegas’s strategy than the Wild.
The Blues and Wild are both very good teams, but the Avs are a great team.
Sound off in the comments below on who you would rather face between two of the Avs' biggest current rivals.

With that in mind, advantage St. Louis.
Benjamin Hochman, sports columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: I don't like this first-round playoff matchup.
St. Louis came out sluggish at first, with several bad shifts by key players like Ivan Barbashev and Robert Thomas.
St. Louis suddenly had the game in their back pocket after seemingly being outdone by the Wild for much of the first two periods.
