     Did Megan Thee Stallion LIE about foot injury caused by Tory Lanez? New post muddies claims

     Summary: The ongoing Megan Thee Stallion vs Tory Lanez case got a bizarre twist on Thursday when social media was abuzz with rumors that a doctor had confirmed that the rapper's foot injury was due to stepping on glass, and a bullet.
The shooting incident reportedly took place in July 2020 owing to an altercation between Megan and Lanez during Kylie Jenner's party at her Hollywood Hills mansion.
What’s going around is the initial police report.. NOT a medical report.
Megan Thee Stallion attends the 64th Annual GRAMMY Awards at MGM Grand Garden Arena on April 03, 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada.
(Frazer Harrison/Getty ImagesThe medical report obtained by PageSix notes that Megan was “alert,” “oriented” and “breathing comfortably” at the time of her admission.
