    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

The arrest occurred during a livestream on Captain Content’s RV YouTube channel where Dick, among others, have been staying at a campground in O’Neill Regional Park in California’s Trabuco Canyon.
Dick, 56, had a bizarre incident play out over a livestream just last month which resulted in police conducting a welfare check.

Dick told the officers that he was fine and chose to stay in the home.
