     De Bruyne scores four vs Wolves; Man City closer to title (VIDEO)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: De Bruyne netted a first-half hat trick vs. Wolves, scoring in the seventh, 16th and 24th minutes at the Molineux Stadium—before adding a fourth on the hour mark—to put Man City in control and on course for three vital points in the Premier League title race.
City entered the day level on points with Liverpool following the Reds’ come-from-behind win at Aston Villa on Monday.
De Bruyne nearly scored a fifth, too, ratting the left post with another left-footed blast in the 89th minute.
With the win, City restores its three-point edge over Liverpool in the race for the title with two games remaining.
City is going in search of its fourth Premier League title in five seasons, with Liverpool the only other club to win a league trophy in that time.

     Wolves vs Manchester City LIVE: Premier League latest score and goal updates after Kevin De Bruyne nets rapid hat-trick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✕ Close Pep: 'Final final against Wolves massively, massively important'Kevin De Bruyne scored four goals as Manchester City restored a three-point lead at the Premier League summit with a 5-1 win at Wolves.
The playmaker rattled in a left-footed hat-trick inside the opening 24 minutes and added another on the hour as City demonstrated the firepower they have even before Erling Haaland arrives next season.
City’s victory was also an emphatic response to title rivals Liverpool’s success over Aston Villa the previous night and tightened their grip on the title race with just two games to play.
The De Bruyne show was briefly interrupted by a Leander Dendoncker strike early on but a late Raheem Sterling tap-in ensured they would score five for a second successive game.
With the extra insurance of a goal difference now plus seven better than their Merseyside rivals, City are closing in on their fourth title in five seasons.

     Wolves vs Man City: Player ratings and analysis as De Bruyne’s dazzling quadruple turns screw on Liverpool
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City’s Belgian star marked his first ever hat-trick for the club by mimicking the Norwegian striker’s goal celebration, a neat tribute the day after the club confirmed his £51.1m signing.
The goal came from a City attack as the hosts broke upfield through Raul Jimenez and Pedro Neto’s cross picked out Leander Dendoncker for a cool finish.
With City using 37-year-old midfielder Fernandinho as an emergency centre-half, the leaders looked under pressure but De Bruyne’s magnificent composure, and some poor Wolves marking, ensured Guardiola edged closer to the title.
De Bruyne started the move for the seventh minute opener, playing a skilful one-two with Bernardo Silva and racing through to leave Jose Sa with no chance in the Wolves goal.
The pick of the bunch was De Bruyne’s hat-trick goal as Sterling and Rayan Ait-Nourri wrestled for possession.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After Kevin De Bruyne rolled in his and Manchester City’s fourth goal, Pep Guardiola jumped into the arms of his assistant, Rodolfo Borrell.
At the end of the game De Bruyne trotted over to the referee, Martin Atkinson, to collect the match ball.
Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersIt was the perfect start but Wolves replied four minutes later when Leander Dendoncker capped a fine counterattack.
Wolves struggled to break City’s endless chain and De Bruyne completed his hat-trick without breaking sweat.
Inevitably, it was De Bruyne who would score City’s fourth.
