     Avatar 2 finally has a title, and the first trailer will debut with Doctor Strange
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first Avatar sequel will be called Avatar: The Way of Water, Disney announced Wednesday at CinemaCon, perhaps the biggest indication yet that the long-delayed movie is actually going to be released on December 16th.
And we might have even more potential proof soon, as the first teaser trailer is set to debut alongside Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which premieres on May 6th.
I would like to call your attention to that “begins to tell” language because The Way of Water isn’t the only Avatar film to look forward to.
Avatars 3, 4, and 5 are also in the works, each set to release about two years after the one before it.
But if you are a little fuzzy on the details of the film — and I can’t blame you if that’s the case — Disney will be re-releasing Avatar in theaters on September 23rd.

     ‘Avatar 2’ Official Title and Release Date Announced as First Footage Premieres at CinemaCon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For years now, Avatar 2 has seemed like an enigma, an, “I’ll believe it when I see it” moment.
But the first footage of James Cameron’s Avatar sequel was revealed today at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, as well as the film’s official title, Avatar: The Way of Water.
Set several years after the first film, Avatar: The Way of Water is the story of the Jake Sully (Worthington), Neytiri (Saldana), and their children, who will anchor all four of the proposed Avatar sequels.
Avatar: The Way of Water will not be released in theaters until December 16, and the remaining Avatar sequels have been projected to come out on Dec. 20, 2024, Dec. 18, 2026, and Dec. 22, 2028.
The original film came out in 2009, so to refresh memories and expose new fans who weren’t yet born (but are actual teenagers now) to the original, Disney plans to re-release Avatar in theaters on Sept. 23.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s a big day for fans of Avatar, the James Cameron film about humans attempting to mine the alien planet of Pandora for its rich resources.
The long-delayed sequel, scheduled to come out on Dec. 16, will be titled Avatar: The Way of Water.
A new trailer for the movie will launch exclusively in theaters, playing before Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness when it debuts next week.
The film has been delayed and rescheduled many times since its original projected 2014 release.
For those who don’t quite remember what happened in the original 2009 Avatar, Disney is remastering the film and plans to release it in theaters globally on Sept. 23.

     Disney announces Avatar 2 title, premieres teaser trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: During Walt Disney Studios’ CinemaC on presentation Wednesday morning, Avatar producer Jon Landau presented the forthcoming teaser trailer for the long-awaited first (of many) sequels to the 2009 blockbuster, entitled Avatar: The Way Of Water.
But in his prepared statements, Landau leaned heavily on the timelessness of Cameron’s storytelling.
“One of the strengths of Jim Cameron’s scripts are always the universal and relatable themes that he weaves into them,” he said.
“While I’m making a movie, it’s working with the actors that I find the most rewarding,” he admitted.
But scenes involving flying, and even underwater, offered glimpses of Cameron’s “Volume”-based filmmaking in unprecedented environments such as underwater.

     Summary: After months, nay years, of suspense, Disney on Wednesday unveiled the first trailer for James Cameron’s Avatar sequel, also giving the movie an official title.
“At the center of each of the four sequels will be the Sully family.
The Avatar 2 trailer will then go online a week later.
The logline on the movie: Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) lives with his newfound family formed on the planet of Pandora.
That film is the highest-grossing movie of all time worldwide at $2.8 billion, regaining that title after overtaking Avengers: Endgame during the pandemic.

     James Cameron’s ‘Avatar 2’ Debuts Visually Dazzling Footage at CinemaCon, Gets Official Title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CinemaCon attendees were given 3D glasses to watch the minutes-long trailer, which contained almost no dialogue.
Instead, exhibitors were immersed into different regions across the dazzling world of Pandora through sweeping visuals of the planet’s crystal blue oceans and lakes.
There are understandable fears that enthusiasm for all things “Avatar” has dwindled in the decade since its historic run in theaters.
“Avatar” premiered in December 2009, a time when ticket sales were significantly less expensive than they are these days.
That means Disney must convince the heaps of film exhibitors in the audience at CinemaCon that “Avatar 2” will push cinematic boundaries, so much so that it’ll be worth the expensive equipment upgrades needed to match Cameron’s dazzling vision.
