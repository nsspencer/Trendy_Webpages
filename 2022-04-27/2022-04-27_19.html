     Moon Knight Episode 5 Review: Asylum
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This review contains Moon Knight spoilersIn Moon Knight episode 5, “Asylum”, we finally got to know Marc Spector, and the show was all the better for it.
Even when Legion was objectively flawed or problematic, it still found interesting ways to keep you invested.
After mulling it over, I think investment has been my core problem with Moon Knight.
When puzzle pieces are missing from a plot, that can be exciting and mysterious.
But when so many key puzzle pieces are missing from a lead character I’m asked to root for, it’s a bit of a struggle for me to connect with them properly.

     Moon Knight Review: Why Episode 5 Is Darker For the Better
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After what sure seemed like the death of Marc Spector last week on Moon Knight, fans had no idea what to expect going forward in Episode 5—well, besides spending some more time with a talking Hippo.
Warning - the rest of this article contains spoilers for Episode 5 of Moon Knight.
Now, it's time to take a deep dive into why Moon Knight Episode 5 succeeds so well with its darker storyline.
ADVERTISEMENTThe Origin of Moon KnightMarvelWe also got to see the very moment Marc Spector became the Avatar of Khonshu—and even get his Moon Knight moniker.
It’s safe to say that fans likely won’t ever have a Moon Knight without multiple personalities, so a return from Steven seems probable.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This story contains spoilers for Moon Knight Episode Five.
We love Moon Knight, don't get us wrong.
In the midst of his pain, Spector assumes the identity of his favorite fictional, Indiana Jones-esque adventurer, Steven Grant.
Marc Spector lives with the trauma of loss and parental abuse; Steven Grant, until this episode, is the persona Spector assumes when he needs to shift into a relatively pain-free life to survive.
Plus, we doubt that Steven Grant is gone for good.

     'Moon Knight' Episode 5 Recap: Marvel's Most Intense Emotional Journey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moon Knight gave even more double Oscar Isaac action on Wednesday, with episode 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe series landing on .
As the human avatar of moon good Khonshu (F. Murray Abraham), Marc has also been unable to access his superheroic Moon Knight abilities due to Khonshu's imprisonment by his fellow gods.
Balanced scalesTaweret, the goddess of childbirth and fertility, is initially determined to bring Marc and Steven to A'aru, the Field of Reeds (the Egyptian afterlife).
In the course of the fight, Steven falls into the sands and is frozen, which balances Marc's scales and allows him to enter A'aru.
It's possible he has another personality lurking in his mind, but that would presumably have been revealed during this episode's journey.

     ‘Moon Knight’ Episode 5 Recap: Judgment Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But like everything else in Moon Knight, what’s real or not isn’t always so easy to discern.
There’s only one episode left in Moon Knight, and the series has a lot of ground still to cover.
Before we look ahead to the season finale, though, let’s examine Marc’s past and how he became Moon Knight.
Becoming Moon KnightIn the midst of Marc and Steven’s journey through Marc’s past, they make a stop in Egypt on the day that Marc became Moon Knight.
What’s Next on Moon KnightWithin the first six minutes of the Moon Knight premiere, Steven Grant and a little girl at the British museum foresaw what was to come.

     Summary: Moon Knight Asylum Season 1 Episode 5 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Marvel StudiosWhat is Steven if not Marc persevering?
Moon Knight’s penultimate episode essentially plays the same game that the corresponding episode of WandaVision did, using memory and flashbacks to unpack the main character’s adverse childhood experiences before we go into the finale.
We first heard about the Field of Reeds — within the context of Moon Knight, that is — in the series’ very first episode.
Over the course of the episode, Marc and/or Steven occasionally get stressed out and disassociate back to Harrow’s office.
The actor who stars as Dr. Grant, Doug Perlin, is a portmanteau of Moon Knight comics’ co-creators Don Perlin and Doug Moench.
