     Why Dr. Fauci is saying the US is 'out of the pandemic phase' of COVID-19
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday the United States was "out of the pandemic phase."
The United States is "out of the pandemic phase" after more than two years of COVID-19 causing tens of millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser for President Joe Biden.
"We are certainly right now in this country out of the pandemic phase," Fauci told PBS' Judy Woodruff.
"Namely, we don't have 900,000 new infections a day, and tens and tens and tens of thousands of hospitalizations, and thousands of deaths.
Although metrics in the United States have improved since the winter, Fauci said, he does not believe the country would eradicate COVID-19.

     US out of the ‘pandemic phase’ of COVID-19, Dr. Anthony Fauci says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dr. Anthony Fauci says the US is no longer in the “pandemic phase” of COVID-19 — more than two years after the coronavirus first began wreaking havoc on the nation.
How close are we to the end of the pandemic?” Woodruff asked.
“We are certainly, right now, in this country out of the pandemic phase,” Fauci replied.
We are at a low level right now.”“So, if you’re saying, are we out of the pandemic phase in this country, we are,” he added.
While the US is no longer in the “pandemic phase,” Fauci said there is still a global crisis.

"We are certainly right now in this country out of the pandemic phase," Fauci said in an interview with PBS NewsHour.
"So if you're saying, 'Are we out of the pandemic phase in this country?'
The infectious disease expert said it's "an unanswerable question" to ask when the global pandemic will end.
But, right now, we are not in the pandemic phase in this country."

On Wednesday, Fauci told CNN that his comments had been mischaracterized by some to mean that the pandemic is over, "which is not what I said."
Don't let anybody get the misinterpretation that the pandemic is over, but what we are in is a different phase of the pandemic," he said.
"A phase that's a transition phase, hopefully headed toward more of a control where you can actually get back to some form of normality without total disruption of society, economically, socially, school-wise, etc."

     Summary: Dr. Anthony Fauci said the US is "out of the pandemic phase" with COVID-19, but he's still taking some precautions.
US COVID-19 cases are up, but hospitalizations remain low, and deaths are dropping.
"We are certainly — right now in this country — out of the pandemic phase," Fauci said during an interview on PBS NewsHour, when asked by anchor Judy Woodruff how close we are to the end of the pandemic.
But, in the US, "we don't have 900,000 new infections a day, and tens and tens and tens of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths," he said.
The European Commission, similarly, released a statement on Wednesday saying the EU is "transitioning out of the acute COVID-19 phase."

We are still experiencing a pandemic,” Fauci said.
He said the United States was in the “full-blown pandemic phase” in the winter, then entered a period he refers to as the “deceleration” phase.
AdvertisementIn May 2021, Fauci told The Post he thought the virus could reach the “control” stage by autumn of that year.
… We’re not in the full-blown explosive pandemic phase.
