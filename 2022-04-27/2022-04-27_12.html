     Summary: Mr. Hwang knew that Archegos could affect markets simply through the exercise of its buying power, the complaint said.
In June 2020, an Archegos employee asked Mr. Hwang if the rising price of ViacomCBS shares was a “sign of strength.” Mr. Hwang responded: “No.
The collapse led to billions in losses for a number of banks, but Credit Suisse incurred the most pain.
Over the past few months, federal authorities have demanded documents from the firm and banks and had meetings and interviews with a number of former employees at Archegos, including Mr. Hwang.
The indictment names two former Archegos employees, Scott Becker and William Tomita, as part of the scheme.

     Archegos Founder Bill Hwang, Former CFO Charged With Securities Fraud

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Archegos Capital Management founder Bill Hwang and its former chief financial officer, Patrick Halligan, were indicted on securities fraud and racketeering charges Wednesday in what prosecutors said was a massive fraud and manipulation scheme that nearly jeopardized the U.S. financial system.
Archegos collapsed in March 2021, leaving banks with more than $10 billion in losses and sparking calls for more regulatory oversight.
More than $100 billion in stock market value vanished in a matter of days.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bill Hwang, the founder of the family office whose messy collapse cost banks billions last year, was arrested and hit with federal criminal charges Wednesday.
The latest: Federal authorities accused Hwang, as well as some other former Archegos employees, of fraudulently misleading brokerage firms and using deceptive and manipulative trading techniques to move market prices.
What they're saying: "Hwang and his co-conspirators duped some of Wall Street's leading banks.
"They lied about how big Archegos' investments had become.
Editor’s note: A previous version incorrectly included Deutsche Bank in a list of banks that incurred losses connected to Archegos.

     Archegos owner Bill Hwang and former CFO Halligan plead not guilty to U.S. fraud charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Archegos Capital Management's owner, Bill Hwang, and its former chief financial officer, Patrick Halligan, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to criminal charges filed against them in connection with the implosion of the family office last year.
The charging documents say Hwang and Halligan used leverage to inflate their market positions, which swelled to as much as $160 billion before the scheme came crashing down.
Hwang allegedly used derivative securities that had no public disclosure requirements, which helped shield the size of Archegos' positions in the market.
In 2012, Hwang pleaded guilty in an insider trading case involving two Chinese bank stocks.
Last May, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood disclosed that Hwang had provided the seed funding for her first four ETFs.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadThe owner of Archegos Capital Management was arrested Wednesday on fraud and racketeering charges in connection with the dramatic collapse of the multibillion-dollar private equity firm last year.
AdvertisementHwang and Halligan were arraigned Wednesday afternoon, and both pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud.
Hwang will be released on $100 million bail, Bloomberg News reported.
When the firm couldn’t, some banks sold their positions, causing the stocks’ prices to fall even further.
After the investigation, Hwang turned Tiger Asia into a family fund, Archegos.

     The Man Who Collapsed Wall Street
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here was something of a self-made man, emigrated from Korea, who got rich — like, $30 billion in the bank rich.
It’s a neat trick, losing more than $20 billion in two days, but Hwang did it, the absolute GOAT of losing money.
In the months after, Wall Street tried to piece together how it could have happened.
The whole Hwang saga shows just how much of Wall Street remains shrouded in secrecy 12 years after the Obama administration passed its landmark Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul.
Hwang was able to swell Archegos so much and so quickly through the kind of financial engineering that is still commonplace on Wall Street today, if not to the extent allegedly executed by Archegos.
