     Anthony Rizzo (8 HRs) is making Yankees look smart for not writing Freddie Freeman a blank check | Klapisch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK – Let’s turn the clock back approximately two months, just as the pitchfork mob was coming after Hal Steinbrenner for letting Freddie Freeman get away.
Unlike Steve Cohen’s Mets, who bid against themselves to buy Max Scherzer’s loyalty, the Baby Boss had no desire to drain his bank account for Freeman – not when he had a reasonably-price Plan B in Anthony Rizzo.
Rizzo made all the sense in the world, except to a large demographic of ticket buyers who were convinced that a) Steinbrenner was (and is) a cheapskate and b) Rizzo represented everything that was wrong and stale with the Yankees.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Remember when Yankees fans were upset because New York failed to land Matt Olson or Freddie Freeman over the offseason?
Or when they felt underwhelmed when the team decided to roll with Anthony Rizzo as their starting first baseman this season?
Well, Yankees fans probably can’t even remember those negative feelings anymore after the performance Anthony Rizzo had on Tuesday night.
Rizzo placed his name in the record books, as he became the second oldest player in Yankees history to record his first 3 home run game during the regular season at 32 year and 261 days old.
Anthony Rizzo is having a career resurgence at 32 years old and the Yankees have now won four games in a row.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First baseman Anthony Rizzo made a piece of franchise history in the win, as he enjoyed the first three-homer game of his career.
Rizzo’s incredible performance drew an exciting take from Yankees manager Aaron Boone, as reported by Lindsey Adler of The Athletic.
“I think he will be someone who should be able to take advantage of that porch,” Boone continued.
Rizzo certainly took advantage of the short porch in right against the Orioles, as each of his three home runs traveled over the fence in right.
It’s safe to say that Rizzo definitely loves to hit at Yankee Stadium.
