     Opinion: Google's earnings should be a warning to investors in Facebook and other online-ad companies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Google’s earnings shortfall is an indication of trouble across the online-advertising industry, and should scare investors in Facebook and other competitors.
Many analyst questions were around YouTube’s slowing growth rate, and whether or not the company was seeing more competition from TikTok.
In the first quarter, YouTube revenue grew 14.39% to $6.9 billion, its slowest growth in the past five quarters.
In the year-ago quarter, for example, YouTube revenue soared 48.7%.
Porat said that in Google Services, the revenue growth rates in its advertising businesses benefited from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020.

     Google Feels Earnings Impact From Russian War on Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some of the negative impact on Google/Alphabet’s earnings is due to the fact that Alphabet has suspended most commercial activity in Russia.
The suspension of Russian advertising was also expanded so that Google was now blocking Russian-based companies from advertising outside of Russia, effectively isolating Russian businesses from doing any kind of advertising-based business whether inside or outside of Russia.
That is potentially a fairly significant amount of revenue, so it’s clear that the Russian war on Ukraine is having a direct impact on Alphabet.
An indirect impact is from a pullback in advertising in Europe, primarily focused on YouTube advertising spend in Europe.

     Google Stock Slumps As Weaker YouTube Ad Sales Mar Q1 Earnings: $70 Billion Buyback Addition Softens Blow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "We're going to face a tough comp" for search revenues in the second quarter, CFO Ruth Porat told investors last Tuesday.
Group revenues also disappointed, even after rising 23% to $68.01 billion, as ad sales were only in-line with the Street at $54.66 billion.
YouTube ad sales, however, were well shy of forecasts at $6.9 billion as Google suspended activities in Russia and European clients tightened marketing budgets.
So that means in the second quarter of 2022, we're going to face a tough comp."
"While we were cautious on YouTube into earnings, we expected headwinds would not manifest meaningfully until 2Q.
