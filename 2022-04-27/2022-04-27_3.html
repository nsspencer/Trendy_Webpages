     New Don't Worry Darling Image Shows Harry Styles And Florence Pugh Snuggling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Don't Worry Darling Image Shows Harry Styles And Florence Pugh SnugglingDarling, it's been a little slow going, but we'll get there.
That's what I imagine director Olivia Wilde has been saying to those of us waiting with anticipation for her second feature film "Don't Worry Darling."
The movie's trailer dropped in secret at CinemaCon, which was exciting enough ... until Wilde shared a first look image publicly, of course.
The image shows a close-up of stars Florence Pugh and Harry Styles, who play an idyllic married couple in the 1950s, snuggled in bed together with Pugh's hand cupping Styles' cheek.
The sneak peek image is both soft and unsettling at the same time, and it seems to really embody the tone Wilde is going for with this movie.
