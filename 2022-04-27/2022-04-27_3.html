     Biden Leads Tributes to Madeleine Albright
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Biden and much of the nation’s top leadership paid tribute to former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on Wednesday at a time when the West is confronting the very rise of authoritarianism she often warned about.
“In the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Albright,” Mr. Biden told a crowd of 1,400.
Addressing Ms. Albright’s three daughters, the president added: “Your mom was a force, a force of nature.
With her goodness and grace, her humanity and intellect, she turned the tide of history.”Mr. Biden recalled that he was aboard Air Force One heading to Europe to rally NATO allies to stand up to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine when he heard that Ms. Albright had died.
“It was not lost on me that Madeleine was a big part of the reason NATO was still strong and galvanized as it is today,” the president said.

     ‘A force for good’: Biden and other political stars eulogize Albright
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Her name is still synonymous with America as a force for good in the world.
“She made sure that young women knew they belonged [at] every single table having to do with national security, without exception,” Biden said.
The music at Wednesday’s service included pieces by Czech composers in a nod to Albright’s roots: Albright was born in 1937 in what was then Czechoslovakia.
Her Jewish family fled Prague to escape the Nazis, and Albright later came to the United States as a political refugee at age 11.
Albright had even been invited to compete on “Dancing With the Stars,” Clinton added, after she “tore up the dance floor” at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding.

     'Her story was America's story': Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton remember Madeleine Albright
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "In the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Korbel Albright," said President Joe Biden, eulogizing Albright at her funeral at Washington National Cathedral.
More than 1,400 people, each wearing a face mask at the request of the Albright family, packed the cathedral.
They heard Biden, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton describe how Albright urged other women to "interrupt" and how, despite her small stature, she wasn't afraid to stand up to America's biggest adversaries.
Hillary Clinton, who lost her 2016 bid to become the nation’s first female president, said Albright “didn’t just help women.
The ceremony's final tributes came from Albright's three daughters: Anne Albright, Alice Albright and Katherine Albright.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)CNN —President Joe Biden on Wednesday eulogized Madeleine Albright, describing the first female US secretary of state as a “force of nature” and a champion of democracy.
“With her goodness and grace, her humanity and her intellect, she turned the tide of history,” Biden said during the funeral service at the Washington National Cathedral.
The President said Albright remained a “nexus of the foreign policy community” in the decades after she left office.
Albright, Biden said, was “always, and I mean always, on top of the latest developments.
Albright’s daughters – Anne Albright, Alice Albright and Katharine Albright – will speak as well.
