     McCarthy accused Republicans of ‘putting people in jeopardy’ after Capitol attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kevin McCarthy, the senior Republican in the House of Representatives, privately accused one of his colleagues of “putting people in jeopardy” in the wake of the January 6 insurrection, according to a leaked audio recording.
In a phone call with Republican leaders on 10 January 2021, McCarthy said that Matt Gaetz, a Florida congressman and ardent Trump supporter, was putting Americans at risk with his comments after the assault on the US Capitol that left five people dead.
The New York Times obtained a recording of the call, in which McCarthy and Republicans including Steve Scalise, the No 2 House Republican, discussed an interview Gaetz had given where he attacked GOP members who had criticized Trump.
“He’s putting people in jeopardy,” McCarthy said of Gaetz.
Boebert has been a staunch defender of Trump’s actions that day.

     Letters to the Editor: Kevin McCarthy denying what he was recorded saying is so Republican
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “These are not the droids you’re looking for” — or better, these are not the facts you’re looking for.
(“What the GOP’s muted response on the McCarthy tapes means for the Republican Party,” April 22)House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) denied he made comments about asking then-President Trump to resign after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, then the tapes are produced.
It appears that McCarthy and the majority of Republicans have put party above what these values mean to most Americans.
McCarthy’s blatant lie got little more than a shrug from his party and probably less from Republican voters.
The art of politics has been replaced with allegiance to the tribe, and in the tribe, not lying is disqualifying.

     Jan. 6 committee wants to talk to Kevin McCarthy after Mo Brooks recording
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol is redoubling its efforts to have GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy appear for an interview amid new revelations concerning his private conversations about the deadly attack, the chairman said Tuesday.
McCarthy singled out several conservative representatives, among them Matt Gaetz of Florida and Mo Brooks of Alabama, as potentially endangering the security of other lawmakers and the Capitol complex.
Brooks dismissed the report, telling the Times on Tuesday that “Kevin McCarthy spoke before knowing the facts.” He said he did not recall Mr. McCarthy ever speaking with him directly about his rally speech.
Earlier, the Times reported that McCarthy, in conversations with House Republicans, said that Trump had acknowledged bearing some responsibility for the attack.
Additionally, the panel is now eyeing other House Republican lawmakers reported to have been working closely with Mark Meadows, Trump’s former White House chief of staff, as they sought to challenge Biden’s win.

     Kevin McCarthy defends remarks on leaked audio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —At a closed-door Republican conference meeting Wednesday, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy gave a full-throated defense of his recently leaked comments where he expressed concern about far-right House Republicans inciting violence in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection.
McCarthy defended the remarks as saying they needed to discuss every scenario — and the tapes only included a portion of his comments and don’t have the full context.
Perry emerged from the meeting telling reporters that the Democrats and media just want to use January 6 as a distraction.
In the audio obtained and reported on by The New York Times on Tuesday, McCarthy repeatedly lamented the inflammatory comments made by some GOP lawmakers following the US Capitol attack.
I don’t want to play politics with any of that.”McCarthy did not respond to questions from reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday regarding The New York Times report.

     Republicans Give Kevin McCarthy Standing Ovation for Failing to Take a Stand Against Trump After Jan. 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, first in line to become Speaker of the House if Republicans take over in November, is facing the music.
The song in particular is leaked audio from a meeting McCarthy had with fellow Republicans after the Jan. 6 insurrection, in which McCarthy said that he’d “had it with this guy,” adding that “What he did is unacceptable.
Nobody can defend that, and nobody should defend it.” McCarthy also promised to urge Trump to resign, according to two New York Times reporters.
Trump’s apparent forgiveness of McCarthy shows that he’s not in a hurry to shakeup the GOP’s power structure in the House.
“I think it’s all a big compliment, frankly,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal, referring to McCarthy and other Republicans who pulled away after Jan. 6 and then apologized.

     Carlson attacks Democratic “puppet” Kevin McCarthy for worrying Republicans would “incite violence”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Kevin McCarthy of California told his good friend Liz Cheney that he hopes the social media companies would censor more conservative Republicans in Congress," Carlson said.
"That would mean we would have a Republican Congress led by a puppet of the Democratic party," he said.
In an earlier audio clip, McCarthy also told Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., then the No.
But those comments make clear that in the wake of Jan. 6, Republican leaders were highly concerned that members of the GOP would further stoke violence.
Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., who said he was horrified by Brooks' comments, told the Times he quit the Republican steering committee in protest.

     For a moment, Kevin McCarthy fretted about GOP rhetoric. It passed.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Times obtained audio from a Jan. 10, 2021, call between McCarthy and other top House Republicans, including Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.)
Trump’s response, according to those with whom McCarthy spoke soon after, was to suggest that McCarthy was insufficiently concerned about Trump’s electoral loss.
All of us must resist the temptation of further polarization,” McCarthy said on Jan. 13, 2021.
AdvertisementBy the time the moment for that accountability arrived, though, McCarthy was once again aligned with his caucus.
A few months after that, Gonzalez — who, along with Cheney, was one of 10 House Republicans to support Trump’s impeachment — announced his decision not to seek reelection.
