     Masked Singer US: Kirstie Alley is revealed as Baby Mammoth as she is eliminated
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actor Kirstie Alley was the second star to be eliminated from the third round of contestants on The Masked Singer US after she was revealed as Baby Mammoth.
On Wednesday (27 April), the eighth episode of the season saw Baby Mammoth compete against Space Bunny in a final sing-off to try to save her spot on the show.
However, judges Ken Jeong, Jenny McCarthy, Robin Thicke, and Nicole Scherzinger voted to save Space Bunny after his rendition of “Do You Really Want to Hurt Me”.
However, McCarthy swapped her initial answer of Dianne Wiest with Kirstie Alley, which ultimately left her as the only one to guess correctly.
The Masked Singer continues on Wednesdays at 8pm on Fox.
