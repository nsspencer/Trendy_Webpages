     MAGA’s Knives Are Out for Kevin McCarthy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But few have been caught in such glaring, bald-faced lies as Kevin McCarthy.
Since then, McCarthy has been begging for Trump’s forgiveness and attempting to convince the GOP he’s still committed to the band.
Still, he’d be a fool to mistake his closed-door, standing ovation for an indication that the knives aren’t out.
“Kevin McCarthy is a puppet of the Dem Party,” read a chron on Tucker Carlson Tonight.
McCarthy should know as well as anyone in the game: politicians lie.

     Kevin McCarthy defends remarks on leaked audio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) At a closed-door Republican conference meeting Wednesday, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy gave a full-throated defense of his recently leaked comments where he expressed concern about far-right House Republicans inciting violence in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection.
The California Republican said Wednesday that the effort was all part of an attempt to divide the GOP conference ahead of the midterms, according to several sources at meeting.
McCarthy got a standing ovation, the sources said.
McCarthy defended the remarks as saying they needed to discuss every scenario — and the tapes only included a portion of his comments and don't have the full context.
At the meeting, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz asked House GOP Whip Steve Scalise about Scalise's taped comments that Gaetz's incendiary January 6 remarks were "potentially illegal."

     Kevin McCarthy shores up support after leaked audio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: House Republicans are closing ranks around Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy after the New York Times published audio of a call four days after the Capitol riot in which he voiced support for some of his members losing access to Twitter.
At least one GOP House candidate, Joe Kent of Washington, has outright said he won't vote for him.
Top-rated Fox News host Tucker Carlson savaged McCarthy during his program on Tuesday night, branding him "a puppet of the Democratic Party."
What they're saying: Members of the right-wing Freedom Caucus, who are the most likely to criticize McCarthy, seem to agree.
"I haven't heard about those yet," said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), quipping, "McCarthy, who's McCarthy?"

     Kevin McCarthy Once Again Caught Contemplating Doing the Right Thing Before Ultimately Doing Nothing Like the Coward He Is
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But McCarthy was still furious that reporters Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin outed him for temporarily considering doing the right thing, lashing out in an angry statement: “The New York Times’ reporting on me is totally false and wrong.
“He’s putting people in jeopardy,” McCarthy said of Gaetz, noting that he was going to speak with the Florida congressman about attacking colleagues by name.
I do not want to look back and think we caused something or we missed something and someone got hurt.
McCarthy and Rep. Scalise held views about President Trump and me that they shared on sniveling calls with Liz Cheney, not us.
Nobody accuses this guy of thinking of doing the right thing before he reassesses how it will affect his career and does absolutely jack shit, ya hear?!

     Kevin McCarthy Is Empowering House Extremists He Once Feared
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Win McNamee/Getty ImagesJust over six months before the 2022 midterm elections, you have to figure House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy can practically feel the weight of the Speaker’s gavel in his hand.
Sure, Donald Trump is lurking nearby, snarling and howling like the hound of the Baskervilles with his pack of fanatical supporters in tow.
But so far, it’s not enough to keep the midterms from being primarily a referendum on his successor.
But unfortunately for Kevin McCarthy, the news media and the House Committee on January 6 won’t let the dire insurrectionary events surrounding the Capitol riot and Trump’s attempted election coup fade into history.
The country was “too crazy,” Mr. McCarthy said, for members to be talking and tweeting recklessly at such a volatile moment.
