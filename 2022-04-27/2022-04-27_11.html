     Monty Williams on Mikal Bridges: “You can’t clone him, but you wish you could”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mikal Bridges stepped up big time for the Suns in absence on Devin Booker.
The 25-year-old small forward who is regarded as one of the best defenders in the NBA showcased his offensive talent as well.
He played team-high 47 minutes (Chris Paul was second with 39) and was the top scorer for Phoenix with 31 points.
“You can’t clone him, but you wish you could,” Suns head coach Monty Williams said of Bridges postgame.
He’s just one of those rare basketball players that can play that way on defense, but also give you the point production that he gave tonight.”

     Mikal Bridges' Game 5 Leads to Michael Jordan Meme, Suns HC Wishes to 'Clone' Him
    </h2>

     Summary: Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty ImagesMikal Bridges, welcome to the land of NBA Twitter playoff hyperbole.
But it was his lockdown defense on CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram that drew the overwhelming amount of applause.
The four-year, $90 million contract extension Bridges signed with the Suns before the season is already looking like a bargain.
"You can't clone him, but you wish you could," Suns coach Monty Williams said after the game.
Phoenix struggled to generate offense in Game 4 without its leading scorer but seemed to find a rhythm on the back of Bridges in Game 5.

Right from tip-off, Suns’ wing Mikal Bridges imposed himself on both ends of the court.
Suns’ center Deandre Ayton spoke after the game about how critical Bridges is to the team’s success.
“That’s what [Mikal] do, that’s our Iron Man,” Ayton said.
I haven’t played a game in a Suns uniform without [Mikal],” Paul pointed out.

In his four years as an NBA player, Bridges hasn’t missed a game.

     Mikal Bridges does so much in Game 5 that Suns wish they could ‘clone’ him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Suns coach Monty Williams on Tuesday said he wished he could clone Mikal Bridges.
And Williams didn’t say that because Bridges played all but 66 seconds of the Suns’ 112-97 win that gave Phoenix a 3-2 lead heading into Thursday’s game at New Orleans.
He said it because Bridges did all those things, in one night, during the most crucial game of the Suns’ season.
“We put him on everybody,” Williams said of his Bridges’ defense.
But really, everybody knew exactly why the Suns regained control of this series: It was Bridges, the guy they wished they could clone.

     Summary: Chris Paul added 22 points and 11 assists, bouncing back from a subpar performance in Game 4.
The Suns never trailed but also never totally pulled away until the final few minutes against the feisty Pelicans.
"We have to change the way we start a game and come out with energy," Pelicans center Jonas Valanciunas said.
The Pelicans had a 42-15 advantage in foul shots during Game 4, which the Suns lost.
Suns: Booker has been working out at the team's practice facility, but it's still unclear when he'll be able to return.

     Summary: Bridges burns him here, though, sliding deeper into the corner at the same time that Jones provides help on the drive.
If that isn't annoying enough to account for, Bridges can also lift to the wing then backdoor you when necessary.
Bridges lifts to the right wing around the same time that Deandre Ayton slips to the free throw area.
Ingram thinks Bridges is still at the wing, so he jumps towards that area when Ayton begins to survey the floor.
There may not be 31 points for Bridges every night, but it also doesn't have to be that way.
