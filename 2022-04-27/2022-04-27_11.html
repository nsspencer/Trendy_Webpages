     Bulls vs. Bucks final score: Chicago’s season ends with 116-100 Game 5 loss to Milwaukee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Coming into Game 5, it was going to take a heroic effort from the Chicago Bulls to extend this first-round playoff series.
Like the prior two games, the fourth quarter was essentially garbage time as the lights closed on the 2021-22 Bulls season with a 116-100 loss.
Chicago came into this game with a plan of launching from downtown, attempting a playoff franchise-high 52 3-pointers.
With Milwaukee’s defense packing the paint and swarming DeMar DeRozan again, there were kickout opportunities for the Bulls to strike.
With this defeat, we now head to the offseason for the Chicago Bulls.
