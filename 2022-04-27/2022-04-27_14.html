     ‘The Survivor’ Review: Clenched Fists
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The Survivor,” adapted by Justine Juel Gillmer from a book by Haft’s son Alan Scott Haft, proceeds through interlocked flashbacks from 1963.
A toughened-up but spry and credibly accented Ben Foster plays Harry.
Vicky Krieps plays a potential romantic interest who helps him search for the woman he loved in Poland.
But while Levinson is not working from his own history as in “Diner” or “Avalon,” “The Survivor,” partly because of its subject matter and postwar milieu, feels of a piece with those overtly personal films.

     'The Survivor' wins a split decision with Harry Haft's remarkable Holocaust story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The underlying story is better than the movie in "The Survivor," but that material is so harrowing as to win on what amounts to a split decision.
Timed to Holocaust Remembrance Day, the film isn't equal to the awards bait HBO has traditionally offered in the TV-movie genre, but it should inspire plenty of googling about the remarkable tale of Harry Haft.
The project marks the fourth HBO film from director Barry Levinson, whose past efforts were devoted to Joe Paterno , Dr. Jack Kevorkian and Bernie Madoff .
The major miscalculation involves the casting of Ben Foster , who is very good as Haft, but roughly twice as old as he was during World War II.
Rail-thin as a prisoner, Haft is noticed by a German officer (Billy Magnussen), who offers him the opportunity to survive -- and even enjoy certain privileges -- by engaging in gladiatorial combat with other prisoners.

The reliably old-school Rocksroy went back into his Survivor circa 2002 handbook and tried to form an all men’s alliance.
And, in a repeat of last season, the tribe was split into two teams for two separate tribal vote-offs.
“I was so proud because we have four Black contestants in Survivor,” Drea tells Jeff when asked about her reaction to Rocksroy’s elimination.
Sure, you might just want the fun challenges and the blindsides, but Survivor, at its core, is a human experiment.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is the question that animates Jewish director Barry Levinson’s new movie “The Survivor,” which came out on Yom HaShoah on HBO Max.
The film depicts the true story of Auschwitz survivor Harry Haft, who became a boxer in the United States and lived to 82, dying in 2007.
But the director also shows that, externally, Haft is driven to find his reason in the form of Leah.
“If not to live?”But it’s Miriam Wofsoniker, played by Vicky Krieps, who answers Perez’s question by becoming Harry’s new love interest.
Now, as Harry embraces her, she comes to represent vibrant and burgeoning love in the same way that Leah once did.
