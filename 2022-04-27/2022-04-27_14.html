     Moon Knight Episode 5 Ending Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First you have what we imagine to be the regular world where Moon Knight is just one of many heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The second world is the asylum where psychiatrist Dr. Harrow tries to make sense of Marc and Steven’s adventures in a grounded setting.
Then there’s the third world, where Marc and Steven are trying to comprehend the afterlife.
Marc experienced the truth when it came to his mother, but Steven got to live the lie that his mother loved him.
Without that trauma, Steven was free to live a normal life.

     Summary: This story contains spoilers for Moon Knight Episode Five.
We love Moon Knight, don't get us wrong.
In the midst of his pain, Spector assumes the identity of his favorite fictional, Indiana Jones-esque adventurer, Steven Grant.
Marc Spector lives with the trauma of loss and parental abuse; Steven Grant, until this episode, is the persona Spector assumes when he needs to shift into a relatively pain-free life to survive.
Plus, we doubt that Steven Grant is gone for good.

     Moon Knight becomes a splintered, Nolan-esque psychological drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementIf you’re the team behind Moon Knight, you opt to do it five episodes into that same-titled series.
But maybe we should start with the first bombshell dropped at the top of the episode: “I’m afraid you’re actually quite dead.” No other way around it.
Now, why it looks like a psych ward (they couldn’t handle what it actually looks like) is simple: “We’re insane,” Marc deadpans.
But given the show’s interest (however slight) in mental health and the ways we develop coping mechanisms to grapple with what we’d rather forget, it’s no surprise to have Moon Knight become a splintered, Nolan-esque psychological drama.
Maybe that’s why I so liked the psych ward scenes; I didn’t have to squint to enjoy them.

     'Moon Knight' Episode 5 Recap: Marvel's Most Intense Emotional Journey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moon Knight gave even more double Oscar Isaac action on Wednesday, with episode 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe series landing on .
As the human avatar of moon good Khonshu (F. Murray Abraham), Marc has also been unable to access his superheroic Moon Knight abilities due to Khonshu's imprisonment by his fellow gods.
Balanced scalesTaweret, the goddess of childbirth and fertility, is initially determined to bring Marc and Steven to A'aru, the Field of Reeds (the Egyptian afterlife).
In the course of the fight, Steven falls into the sands and is frozen, which balances Marc's scales and allows him to enter A'aru.
It's possible he has another personality lurking in his mind, but that would presumably have been revealed during this episode's journey.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But like everything else in Moon Knight, what’s real or not isn’t always so easy to discern.
There’s only one episode left in Moon Knight, and the series has a lot of ground still to cover.
Before we look ahead to the season finale, though, let’s examine Marc’s past and how he became Moon Knight.
Becoming Moon KnightIn the midst of Marc and Steven’s journey through Marc’s past, they make a stop in Egypt on the day that Marc became Moon Knight.
What’s Next on Moon KnightWithin the first six minutes of the Moon Knight premiere, Steven Grant and a little girl at the British museum foresaw what was to come.

     Summary: Moon Knight Asylum Season 1 Episode 5 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Marvel StudiosWhat is Steven if not Marc persevering?
Moon Knight’s penultimate episode essentially plays the same game that the corresponding episode of WandaVision did, using memory and flashbacks to unpack the main character’s adverse childhood experiences before we go into the finale.
We first heard about the Field of Reeds — within the context of Moon Knight, that is — in the series’ very first episode.
Over the course of the episode, Marc and/or Steven occasionally get stressed out and disassociate back to Harrow’s office.
The actor who stars as Dr. Grant, Doug Perlin, is a portmanteau of Moon Knight comics’ co-creators Don Perlin and Doug Moench.
