     Daily aspirin to prevent heart disease and stroke no longer recommended for people 60 and older

     Summary: People aged 60 and older are no longer recommended to take aspirin medication as a way of avoiding heart disease because of the potential health risks, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force announced Tuesday.
Read morePeople aged 60 and older are no longer recommended to take aspirin medication as a way of avoiding heart disease because of the potential health risks, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force announced Tuesday.
Meanwhile, people aged 40 to 59 with at least a 10% risk of 10-year cardiovascular disease should look at taking daily aspirin as an individual choice, the task force said Tuesday.
Heart disease accounts for more than 25% of deaths in the U.S, making it the leading cause in the country, according to the USPSTF.
The task force is made up of 16 appointed volunteers who are each considered leaders within a field of health or medicine.

     ‘No Net Benefit’: Daily Aspirin For Most Now Discouraged By Task Force
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‘No Net Benefit’: Daily Aspirin For Most Now Discouraged By Task ForceThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released a report that finds little to no benefit for people without cardiovascular disease in preventing a heart attack or stroke.
On Tuesday the task force finalized new recommendations advising against the practice.
The task force concludes that initiating daily aspirin in adults 60 years or older has "no net benefit," and increases a person's risk of internal bleeding.
It’s up to those individuals and their doctors to decide whether to take aspirin, the task force concluded.
But in recent years, with new evidence of the possible harm of daily aspirin, health experts shifted those recommendations.

     Older adults shouldn't just start taking daily aspirin, task force says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Middle-aged and older adults shouldn’t be adding a dose of aspirin to their daily routine without consulting a doctor, according to guidance released this week by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Tuesday.
Cardiovascular disease causes one out of every four deaths in the U.S., making it the leading cause of death in the nation.
Now, the task force has determined “with moderate certainty” that aspirin use could have a small net benefit for adults age 40 to 59 who use it to prevent cardiovascular disease.
People over 40 who have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease benefit more from daily aspirin, said the task force.
For those who have started taking a daily dose of aspirin, benefits can accrue over time.

     Low-Dose Aspirin May Cause More Harm Than Benefit For Some, Say New Rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New recommendations on the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke say the blood thinner's risks may outweigh its benefits, breaking from more than 30 years of widely accepted medical guidance.
Current evidence highlighting the risks of internal bleeding associated with aspirin use prompted the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to revise their 2016 guidelines.
Untreated blood clots can lead to heart attack or stroke.
Wong said that quitting smoking, treating hypertension and monitoring blood pressure are also important tools to help prevent a heart attack or stroke.
Those already taking aspirin, or those who have already had a heart attack or stroke, should make all decisions in coordination with a health care professional, Wong said.

     New USPSTF Guidance: Continue to Take Low-Dose Aspirin if you have a History of Heart Attack, AFib, Stroke or Vascular Stenting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 27, 2022 – The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has released its final recommendations on low-dose aspirin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: people who have a history of heart attack, atrial fibrillation (AFib), stroke or vascular stenting should continue to take low-dose aspirin, as directed by their doctor.
For people who have no history of cardiovascular disease or stroke, low-dose aspirin is not recommended for prevention of heart attack or stroke, particularly for adults with higher risk for bleeding.
“The new guidance revising the recommendations on the use of low-dose aspirin strictly applies to adults who have not had a cardiovascular event or any heart disease diagnosis: low-dose aspirin is not appropriate to prevent a first heart attack or stroke in most people.
“We continue to urge clinicians to be extremely selective when prescribing aspirin for adults without known cardiovascular disease.
The scientific evidence continues to confirm healthy lifestyle habits and effectively managing blood pressure and cholesterol are the top ways to prevent a first heart attack or stroke, not low-dose aspirin.
