     Archegos stock manipulation scheme was ‘historic,’ U.S. attorney says.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Archegos used a complex security sold by banks called a total return swap, allowing Mr. Hwang to wager on the movement of stocks without buying them.
And because the banks held the big blocks of stocks, Archegos and Mr. Hwang avoided having to disclose its large positions to regulators and other investors.
Mr. Hwang knew that Archegos could affect markets simply through the exercise of its buying power, the complaint said.
In June 2020, an Archegos employee asked Mr. Hwang if the rising price of ViacomCBS shares was a “sign of strength.” Mr. Hwang responded: “No.
The effective size of the firm’s stock positions swelled to $160 billion from $10 billion, rivaling some of the biggest hedge funds in the world.

     Archegos owner Bill Hwang, former CFO Patrick Halligan charged with fraud
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Archegos Capital Management's owner, Bill Hwang, and its former chief financial officer, Patrick Halligan, were arrested Wednesday in connection with the implosion of the family office last year.
In a 59-page indictment, federal prosecutors allege Hwang used his personal fortune to manipulate markets and commit fraud in a scheme that had far-reaching consequences.
The charging documents say the men used leverage to inflate their market positions, which swelled to as much as $160 billion.
Hwang allegedly used derivative securities that had no public disclosure requirements, which helped shield the size of Archegos' positions in the market.
The family office focused on a handful of companies that included media companies ViacomCBS and Discovery Communications and Chinese education technology company GSX Techedu, among others.
