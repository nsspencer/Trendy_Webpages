     Biden considering broader student loan debt forgiveness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington — President Joe Biden is considering a broader push to forgive federal student loan debt, according to multiple news reports.
Since taking office, the Biden administration has canceled over $17 billion in student loans for about 725,000 borrowers.
But that’s just a piece of the total of more than $1.6 trillion in total federal student loan debt held by 43 million people.
Student loan payments are on hold through August.
Some Democrats have been urging Biden to cancel as much a $50,000 in debt for all borrowers, according to CBS News.

     Biden administration signals a decision on student loan forgiveness could come soon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The tens of millions of Americans saddled with student loans may finally hear soon what the Biden administration has decided to do, if anything, on debt forgiveness.
She went on to say that President Joe Biden "would make a decision about any cancellation of student debt before the conclusion of that pause on student loans."
Roughly a quarter of student loan borrowers — or 10 million people — were estimated to be in delinquency or default.
A recent study found that surveyed student loan borrowers reported a 16% likelihood of quickly missing a payment if the payment pause ended.
Although Biden has expressed skepticism about sweeping student loan forgiveness in the past, another development this week suggests he may be warming up to the idea.

     Biden Mulling Canceling Student Loans: Here's Who May Qualify
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Joe Biden is reportedly mulling options to cancel some student loan debt, amid ongoing calls from Democrats.
Under this action, teachers, military members and health care workers with 10 years of federal loan payments saw immediate cancellation.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has continued to pause federal student loan payments.
During a press briefing on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about Biden possibly canceling all student loans.
"What I would tell you is that not a single person in this country has paid a dime on student — federal student loans since the president took office," Psaki said.

     Biden’s student loan dilemma

     Summary: What Twitter’s deal documents tell usElon Musk’s $44 billion offer to buy Twitter is now in writing.
Twitter’s board approved the transaction this week, but the deal won’t be final until it’s put to a shareholder vote.
Twitter would have to pay Musk $1 billion if it enters into a deal with another bidder, and Musk would have to pay Twitter the same if financing for the deal falls apart.
Twitter’s merger deal, though, specifies at least one instance in which Musk wouldn’t be able to do that.
If the deal is still awaiting regulatory approval, Musk and Twitter would have another six months to close it.

     Republicans target pause on student loan payments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Republicans are pushing back against letting student loan borrowers off the hook — even temporarily — as the White House is eyeing broader student loan debt cancellation.
With the Stop Reckless Student Loan Actions Act, the Republican senators are looking to end President Biden's suspension of federal student loan payments.
It would also prohibit the president from canceling outstanding federal student loan debt due to a national emergency.
He said any future suspension of federal student loan repayments should be left to Congress.
Some 43 million Americans have more than $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt.

     No, Biden Is Not Canceling Most Student Loan Debt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Student loans (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Getty ImagesNo, President Joe Biden is not canceling most student loan debt.
Student LoansReporting from CBS News yesterday claimed that Biden told a group of lawmakers that he was looking at different options to “forgive most, if not all, student loan debt.” As you can imagine, the bold statement that Biden, a moderate Democrat, was considering total student loan cancellation may have led to temporary jubilation among student loan borrowers and advocates for broad student loan forgiveness.
What Biden has said about student loan cancellationDespite what you may have read, let’s clarify where Biden stands on wide-scale student loan forgiveness.
Biden, who has canceled $17 billion of student loans, supports up to $10,000 of wide-scale student loan forgiveness for student loan borrowers;Biden wants Congress to pass legislation to enact wide-scale student loan forgiveness, and he will sign any legislation that Congress passes;Biden doesn’t support total student loan cancellation or even $50,000 of student loan cancellation;Biden doesn’t believe he has the legal authority to enact wide-scale student loan forgiveness through an executive order;Biden is considering several potential options for student loans, including some form of wide-scale student loan cancellation; andIf Biden cancels student loans, it likely happens before November.
The president has not specified how much student loan debt could be canceled, if any, who would qualify, and what the process for student loan forgiveness would be.
