     Summary: NEW YORK ‚Äì Let‚Äôs turn the clock back approximately two months, just as the pitchfork mob was coming after Hal Steinbrenner for letting Freddie Freeman get away.
Unlike Steve Cohen‚Äôs Mets, who bid against themselves to buy Max Scherzer‚Äôs loyalty, the Baby Boss had no desire to drain his bank account for Freeman ‚Äì not when he had a reasonably-price Plan B in Anthony Rizzo.
Rizzo made all the sense in the world, except to a large demographic of ticket buyers who were convinced that a) Steinbrenner was (and is) a cheapskate and b) Rizzo represented everything that was wrong and stale with the Yankees.

Or when they felt underwhelmed when the team decided to roll with Anthony Rizzo as their starting first baseman this season?
Well, Yankees fans probably can‚Äôt even remember those negative feelings anymore after the performance Anthony Rizzo had on Tuesday night.
Rizzo placed his name in the record books, as he became the second oldest player in Yankees history to record his first 3 home run game during the regular season at 32 year and 261 days old.
Anthony Rizzo is having a career resurgence at 32 years old and the Yankees have now won four games in a row.

Against the Orioles on Tuesday, Rizzo hit three home runs, becoming the second-oldest Yankees to do so.
At 32 years and 261 days old, Anthony Rizzo is the second-oldest player in @Yankees history at the time of his first career 3-HR game in the regular season.
The only older one was Babe Ruth, who had his first on May 21, 1930, at 35 years and 104 days old.
Yankees: Anthony Rizzo isn‚Äôt a bad third optionRizzo was definitely aided by Yankee Stadium in his three home run game, as the average homer distance was just 350 feet.
