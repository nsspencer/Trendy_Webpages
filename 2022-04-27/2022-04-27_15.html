Haft later claimed that he threw the fight after three gun-toting mobsters came to his locker-room and threatened his life.
When his daughter, Helene, decided to marry a gentile, he punched out the windows in his home.
“I had my share of beatings,” said Haft, who is now 71.
My mother excused everything by saying, ‘It’s his background.’ Who wanted to hear about his background!”

     'The Survivor' review: Ben Foster stars in the remarkable Holocaust story of Harry Haft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —The underlying story is better than the movie in “The Survivor,” but that material is so harrowing as to win on what amounts to a split decision.
Timed to Holocaust Remembrance Day, the film isn’t equal to the awards bait HBO has traditionally offered in the TV-movie genre, but it should inspire plenty of googling about the remarkable tale of Harry Haft.
The major miscalculation involves the casting of Ben Foster, who is very good as Haft, but roughly twice as old as he was during World War II.
When not flashing back, much of the focus is on Haft’s boxing career, with John Leguizamo as his trainer, Danny DeVito as another fight pro and Peter Sarsgaard as a sportswriter who takes an interest in his story.
And if that doesn’t translate into a great movie, like Haft’s slugfest with Marciano, it makes a strong enough showing to more than earn your respect.

     HBO’s ‘The Survivor’ Asks Profound Question
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is the question that animates Jewish director Barry Levinson’s new movie “The Survivor,” which came out on Yom HaShoah on HBO Max.
The film depicts the true story of Auschwitz survivor Harry Haft, who became a boxer in the United States and lived to 82, dying in 2007.
But the director also shows that, externally, Haft is driven to find his reason in the form of Leah.
“If not to live?”But it’s Miriam Wofsoniker, played by Vicky Krieps, who answers Perez’s question by becoming Harry’s new love interest.
Now, as Harry embraces her, she comes to represent vibrant and burgeoning love in the same way that Leah once did.
