     Experts No Longer Recommend Preventive Daily Aspirin for Heart Attacks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2016, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended that adults aged 50 to 59 years who were at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) should take a daily low-dose (75 to 100 milligrams) aspirin for heart attacks.
Moreover, the USPSTF notes that the new update may not apply to those who already have heart disease or have had a stroke.
“We want to emphasize that these recommendations are focused on starting aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke.
The most common kind of heart disease is coronary artery disease, which can result in a heart attack, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
In some circumstances, aspirin has been found to help prevent heart attacks because it can reduce the clotting of vessels that transport blood to the heart.

     ‘No Net Benefit’: Daily Aspirin For Most Now Discouraged By Task Force
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‘No Net Benefit’: Daily Aspirin For Most Now Discouraged By Task ForceThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released a report that finds little to no benefit for people without cardiovascular disease in preventing a heart attack or stroke.
On Tuesday the task force finalized new recommendations advising against the practice.
The task force concludes that initiating daily aspirin in adults 60 years or older has "no net benefit," and increases a person's risk of internal bleeding.
It’s up to those individuals and their doctors to decide whether to take aspirin, the task force concluded.
But in recent years, with new evidence of the possible harm of daily aspirin, health experts shifted those recommendations.

     Low-Dose Aspirin May Cause More Harm Than Benefit For Some, Say New Rules
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New recommendations on the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke say the blood thinner's risks may outweigh its benefits, breaking from more than 30 years of widely accepted medical guidance.
Current evidence highlighting the risks of internal bleeding associated with aspirin use prompted the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to revise their 2016 guidelines.
Untreated blood clots can lead to heart attack or stroke.
Wong said that quitting smoking, treating hypertension and monitoring blood pressure are also important tools to help prevent a heart attack or stroke.
Those already taking aspirin, or those who have already had a heart attack or stroke, should make all decisions in coordination with a health care professional, Wong said.

     Aspirin might prevent heart attack, but is it worth risk of internal bleeding? For some, no.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An independent panel of prevention experts now says adults 60 and older should not initiate a low-dose aspirin regimen to fend off heart disease, a long-prescribed practice.
Risk of bleeding increases with age, as does the risk of heart disease.
There has been growing awareness of the complications linked to aspirin, Khandelwal said.
It analyzed 11 trials and they showed low-dose aspirin use was associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of nonfatal heart attacks.
In Michigan, heart disease was the top cause of death in 2020, the most recent year for which information is available.

     Summary: The earlier guidelines also suggested that people 60 to 69 with a 10 percent or higher cardiovascular risk should make an individual decision about taking a daily aspirin.
For people age 60 or older, the panel recommends against starting low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD.
Primary prevention recommendations are intended to prevent the first occurrence of a heart attack, stroke or a cardiovascular disease event, he says.
The last thing we want is for people who people who have had a procedure, such as having a stent put in, to stop their daily aspirin.

     New USPSTF Guidance: Continue to Take Low-Dose Aspirin if you have a History of Heart Attack, AFib, Stroke or Vascular Stenting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 27, 2022 – The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has released its final recommendations on low-dose aspirin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: people who have a history of heart attack, atrial fibrillation (AFib), stroke or vascular stenting should continue to take low-dose aspirin, as directed by their doctor.
For people who have no history of cardiovascular disease or stroke, low-dose aspirin is not recommended for prevention of heart attack or stroke, particularly for adults with higher risk for bleeding.
“The new guidance revising the recommendations on the use of low-dose aspirin strictly applies to adults who have not had a cardiovascular event or any heart disease diagnosis: low-dose aspirin is not appropriate to prevent a first heart attack or stroke in most people.
“We continue to urge clinicians to be extremely selective when prescribing aspirin for adults without known cardiovascular disease.
The scientific evidence continues to confirm healthy lifestyle habits and effectively managing blood pressure and cholesterol are the top ways to prevent a first heart attack or stroke, not low-dose aspirin.

     Summary: Cardiovascular disease is an umbrella term that’s used to describe several heart-related conditions, including heart disease, heart attack, stroke, and heart failure, per the American Heart Association (AHA).
Is taking aspirin daily safe?
“Studies show that aspirin reduces the incidence of heart attack and stroke in patients at risk for heart attack and stroke,” Dr. O’Mahony says.
Conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and diabetes raise your risk of heart disease.
