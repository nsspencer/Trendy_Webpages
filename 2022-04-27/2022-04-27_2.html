     At Madeleine Albright’s Service, a Reminder of the Fight for Freedom
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ms. Albright’s service had all of that as well, including performances by her friends, the trumpeter Chris Botti and the jazz pianist Herbie Hancock.
Her pallbearers were former members of her security details as secretary of state and ambassador to the United Nations.
But the timing of Ms. Albright’s memorial in the midst of the most seismic clash between liberty and repression since the Cold War made the event feel all the more resonant.
Defend democracy at home just as vigorously as we do abroad.”In that same phone call before her death, Mr. Clinton recalled that Ms. Albright briskly dismissed questions about her declining health.
She was a chief proponent of NATO expansion and called the United States the “indispensable nation.”

     Summary: [Episcopal News Service] President Joe Biden, as well as former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were among those who paid tribute to Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, during her funeral held April 27 at Washington National Cathedral in the nation’s capital.
“She was loved and admired by all who knew her,” Washington National Cathedral Dean Randy Hollerith said in welcoming the funeral’s invitation-only guests.
After concluding her time as secretary of state in 2001, Albright remained active in the church, including by participating in various cathedral events focused on religion and politics.
It was so perfectly Madeleine,” Clinton said.
… Defend democracy at home just as vigorously as we do abroad.”– David Paulsen is an editor and reporter for Episcopal News Service.

     Presidents eulogize Madeleine Albright at funeral: ‘Freedom had no greater champion’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Presidents and dignitaries gathered in Washington on Wednesday to remember Madeleine Albright, the first woman to serve as US secretary of state, while drawing upon her life’s work to warn of the increasing precariousness of freedom and democracy.
After enduring the Blitz bombing in London, Albright’s family returned to Czechoslovakia once second world war ended, only to be driven out again amid the rise of communism.
“Today we see in Ukraine all too tragically what Madeleine always knew – that the advance of freedom is neither inevitable or permanent.
“Her name is still synonymous with America as a force for good in the world,” Biden said on Wednesday.
But not because of Madeleine Albright,” Bill Clinton said, adding: “We love you, Madeleine.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Albright, Clinton recalled, assured him in that conversation about two weeks before she died last month, that she was getting the best care she could, but didn’t want to “waste time” talking about that.
“The only thing that really matters is what kind of world we’re going to leave to our grandchildren,” Clinton recalled Albright told him.
Albright died of cancer last month at age 84, prompting an outpouring of condolences from around the world that also hailed her support for democracy and human rights.
Biden, who delivered a tribute to Albright, said her name was synonymous with the idea that America is “a force for good in the world.”“In the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Korbel Albright,” Biden said.
She then entered politics and what was at the time the male-dominated world of foreign policy professionals.

To keep NATO countries united, Albright initiated what is now common practice: conference call diplomacy.
