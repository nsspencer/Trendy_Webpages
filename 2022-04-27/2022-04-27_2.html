     Summary: Liverpool are in control of the Champions League semi-final after an emphatic 2-0 victory over Villarreal at Anfield.
The home side dominated throughout, overwhelming Villarreal with their speed, intensity and quality.
Villarreal's defensive excellence frustrated Liverpool at times in the first half, even though Jordan Henderson and Thiago Alcantara hit the post.
Villarreal, who didn't have a single shot on target, were happy to get away from Anfield without further damage.
The tie is not over, but Liverpool are strong favourites to reach the final in Paris.

     Liverpool take first leg of Champions League semi-final against Villarreal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool defeated Villarreal 2-0 at Anfield on Wednesday, earning a vital first-leg victory in the clubs' 2021-22 UEFA Champions League semi-final tie.
The Reds were up against a Villarreal side that had slayed European giants Juventus and Bayern Munich in the rounds leading up to their two-legged affair, and so Liverpool were wary of becoming another big-name victim of the Yellow Submarine.
While there is still a second leg to be played, Jurgen Klopp's men will feel they've put themselves in a strong position to advance to the UCL final.
A rather uneventful first half was followed by a decisive final 45 minutes for Liverpool on Wednesday.
Liverpool doubled their advantage two minutes later through Sadio Mané, who received a brilliant through ball from Mohamed Salah and poked the ball past Rulli at the top of the six-yard box.

     Champions League: How Liverpool erased Villarreal's blueprint for another upset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Part of the irresistible appeal of this Villarreal CF side and their fairytale run to these Champions League semifinals has been their ability to ride their luck.
They did that perfectly for 50 minutes or so until Pervis Estupinan deflected Jordan Henderson's effort over Geronimo Rulli in a 2-0 first-leg defeat at Liverpool on Wednesday.
Ultimately, it felt inevitable that Villarreal's approach would collapse like this at some point.
The important thing is that it is not enough to end their dreamlike run here and now.
There is still an opportunity for them to do the unthinkable next week -- it is just that much harder after this.

     Summary: Liverpool won 2-0 against a Villarreal team nicknamed the 'Yellow Submarine' since the 1960s when the Spanish club's fans used the Beatles song in tribute to their yellow shirts.
For Liverpool, who have already won this season's League Cup, that is the historic goal now.
Mirroring the transformation of the city's Albert Dock into a vibrant, urban hub, Klopp's team are building their own history from the storied foundations laid by their forefathers.
Former Liverpool striker Michael Owen agrees, saying: "It's the best team I have ever seen in a red shirt.
Klopp's team are hitting all the right notes, the only question now is whether they will feel fine with their trophy haul at the end of the season.
