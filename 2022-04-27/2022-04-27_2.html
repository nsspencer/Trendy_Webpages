     Biden, Obama, Clintons speak at funeral for Madeleine Albright, 1st female secretary of state
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Much of official Washington paid tribute to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the first woman to ever serve in that role, at her funeral Wednesday at the National Cathedral.
She served as secretary of state from 1997 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton and as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. from 1993 to 1997.
With the NATO alliance critical in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden highlighted her work to keep NATO "strong and galvanized" when she was the nation's top diplomat.
'Putin is small and pale,' I wrote, 'so cold as to be almost reptilian,'" Albright wrote in the Times.
Both former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also spoke at the funeral, as did Albright's daughters, Anne, Alice and Katie.

     Summary: Albright, Clinton recalled, assured him in that conversation about two weeks before she died last month, that she was getting the best care she could, but didn’t want to “waste time” talking about that.
“The only thing that really matters is what kind of world we’re going to leave to our grandchildren,” Clinton recalled Albright told him.
Albright died of cancer last month at age 84, prompting an outpouring of condolences from around the world that also hailed her support for democracy and human rights.
Biden, who delivered a tribute to Albright, said her name was synonymous with the idea that America is “a force for good in the world.”“In the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Korbel Albright,” Biden said.
She then entered politics and what was at the time the male-dominated world of foreign policy professionals.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Her name is still synonymous with America as a force for good in the world.
In addition to Biden, former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton delivered eulogies in memory of Albright’s life, including her distinction as the nation’s first female secretary of state.
She confirmed both that the longtime diplomat could do a 400-pound leg press, and that she was the one who recommended her husband nominate Albright to become the country’s first female secretary of state.
The music at Wednesday’s service included pieces by Czech composers in a nod to Albright’s roots: Albright was born in 1937 in what was then Czechoslovakia.
Rice and fellow former secretary of state John F. Kerry were seated next to each other, engaged in an animated discussion, before Blinken arrived to greet them.
