     Google reports weaker revenue than expected as YouTube disappoints
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The tech giant fell short of revenue growth expectations – particularly for YouTube, which has seen stiff competition from TikTok.
Google’s parent company Alphabet reported weaker earnings than expected for its first quarter of the year, with a decline in net income and a slowdown in revenue growth.
However, this growth fell short of analyst expectations of $7.5bn and may be due to growing competition from other platforms such as TikTok.
While several parts of Alphabet’s business fell short of expectations in the most recent quarter, the Google Search and Cloud businesses experienced solid growth.
This week, Google Cloud launched Media CDN, which lets media customers deliver content using the same infrastructure that powers YouTube, including tools for ad insertion.

     YouTube drags down Google performance as challenges pile up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: YouTube's dropoff is severe enough to indicate some brands may also be shifting their digital video budgets to other platforms.
However, those challenges coupled with an overall more volatile ad environment are standing up larger obstacles for digital media sites like YouTube.
The executive also said the ongoing war in Ukraine carried an "outsized" impact on YouTube in relation to the company's overall ad business.
YouTube is standing up its own TikTok-like offering called YouTube Shorts.
YouTube last year rolled out a $100 million Shorts fund to encourage more creators to use the feature.

     Google Stock Slumps As Weaker YouTube Ad Sales Mar Q1 Earnings: $70 Billion Buyback Addition Softens Blow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "We're going to face a tough comp" for search revenues in the second quarter, CFO Ruth Porat told investors last Tuesday.
Group revenues also disappointed, even after rising 23% to $68.01 billion, as ad sales were only in-line with the Street at $54.66 billion.
YouTube ad sales, however, were well shy of forecasts at $6.9 billion as Google suspended activities in Russia and European clients tightened marketing budgets.
So that means in the second quarter of 2022, we're going to face a tough comp."
"While we were cautious on YouTube into earnings, we expected headwinds would not manifest meaningfully until 2Q.

     Google Feels Earnings Impact From Russian War on Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some of the negative impact on Google/Alphabet’s earnings is due to the fact that Alphabet has suspended most commercial activity in Russia.
The suspension of Russian advertising was also expanded so that Google was now blocking Russian-based companies from advertising outside of Russia, effectively isolating Russian businesses from doing any kind of advertising-based business whether inside or outside of Russia.
That is potentially a fairly significant amount of revenue, so it’s clear that the Russian war on Ukraine is having a direct impact on Alphabet.
An indirect impact is from a pullback in advertising in Europe, primarily focused on YouTube advertising spend in Europe.
