     Biden Leads Tributes to Madeleine Albright
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — President Biden and much of the nation’s top leadership paid tribute to former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on Wednesday at a time when the West is confronting the very rise of authoritarianism she often warned about.
“In the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Albright,” Mr. Biden told a crowd of 1,400.
Addressing Ms. Albright’s three daughters, the president added: “Your mom was a force, a force of nature.
With her goodness and grace, her humanity and intellect, she turned the tide of history.”Mr. Biden recalled that he was aboard Air Force One heading to Europe to rally NATO allies to stand up to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine when he heard that Ms. Albright had died.
“It was not lost on me that Madeleine was a big part of the reason NATO was still strong and galvanized as it is today,” the president said.

     Biden, Obama, Clintons speak at funeral for Madeleine Albright, 1st female secretary of state
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Much of official Washington paid tribute to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the first woman to ever serve in that role, at her funeral Wednesday at the National Cathedral.
She served as secretary of state from 1997 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton and as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. from 1993 to 1997.
With the NATO alliance critical in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden highlighted her work to keep NATO "strong and galvanized" when she was the nation's top diplomat.
'Putin is small and pale,' I wrote, 'so cold as to be almost reptilian,'" Albright wrote in the Times.
Both former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also spoke at the funeral, as did Albright's daughters, Anne, Alice and Katie.

     'Her story was America's story': Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, remember Madeleine Albright
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "In the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Korbel Albright," said President Joe Biden, eulogizing Albright at her funeral at Washington National Cathedral.
More than 1,400 people, each wearing face masks at the request of the Albright family, packed the cathedral.
Biden sat in the front row next to Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Chelsea Clinton and Al Gore.
"That question is kind of up in the air but not because of Madeleine Albright."
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost her 2016 bid to become the nation’s first woman president, said Albright “didn’t just help women.
