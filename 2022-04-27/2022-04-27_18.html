     Moon Knight Episode 5 Ending Explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First you have what we imagine to be the regular world where Moon Knight is just one of many heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The second world is the asylum where psychiatrist Dr. Harrow tries to make sense of Marc and Steven’s adventures in a grounded setting.
Then there’s the third world, where Marc and Steven are trying to comprehend the afterlife.
Marc experienced the truth when it came to his mother, but Steven got to live the lie that his mother loved him.
Without that trauma, Steven was free to live a normal life.

     25 Moon Knight Episode 5 Easter Eggs You Might've Missed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Marc and Steven end up in Marc's memory about the night Layla's father died, Marc mentions that he went to work for his "old CO Bushman."
In the comics, Raul Bushman debuted in the first Moon Knight comic in 1980, and he worked alongside Marc and Frenchie Duchamp.
Bushman was the person who killed Dr. Peter Alraune, aka Marlene's dad.
As I've mentioned before, a lot of Layla's story overlaps with Marlene's from the comics.
And Bushman fatally wounded Marc, which led him to becoming Moon Knight.

     Moon Knight Review: Why Episode 5 Is Darker For the Better
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After what sure seemed like the death of Marc Spector last week on Moon Knight, fans had no idea what to expect going forward in Episode 5—well, besides spending some more time with a talking Hippo.
Warning - the rest of this article contains spoilers for Episode 5 of Moon Knight.
Now, it's time to take a deep dive into why Moon Knight Episode 5 succeeds so well with its darker storyline.
ADVERTISEMENTThe Origin of Moon KnightMarvelWe also got to see the very moment Marc Spector became the Avatar of Khonshu—and even get his Moon Knight moniker.
It’s safe to say that fans likely won’t ever have a Moon Knight without multiple personalities, so a return from Steven seems probable.

     Moon Knight Episode 5 Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Disney Plus series Moon Knight has never really had much in common with the rest of the catalog of Marvel television shows.
It's entirely possible that Moon Knight doesn't really exist in the MCU.
Moon Knight isn't an Avenger or anything close to it at this part of his life.
If this wasn't the penultimate episode of a Moon Knight series that is only ever going to be six episodes long, it could be lauded as quite the bit of character building.
Of course, Moon Knight has made it very clear that it wants to be a different kind of superhero show.

     'Moon Knight' Episode 5 Recap: Marvel's Most Intense Emotional Journey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moon Knight gave even more double Oscar Isaac action on Wednesday, with episode 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe series landing on .
As the human avatar of moon good Khonshu (F. Murray Abraham), Marc has also been unable to access his superheroic Moon Knight abilities due to Khonshu's imprisonment by his fellow gods.
Balanced scalesTaweret, the goddess of childbirth and fertility, is initially determined to bring Marc and Steven to A'aru, the Field of Reeds (the Egyptian afterlife).
In the course of the fight, Steven falls into the sands and is frozen, which balances Marc's scales and allows him to enter A'aru.
It's possible he has another personality lurking in his mind, but that would presumably have been revealed during this episode's journey.

     ‘Moon Knight’ Miniseries Episode 5 Recap: ‘Asylum’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moon Knight Asylum Season 1 Episode 5 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Marvel StudiosWhat is Steven if not Marc persevering?
Moon Knight’s penultimate episode essentially plays the same game that the corresponding episode of WandaVision did, using memory and flashbacks to unpack the main character’s adverse childhood experiences before we go into the finale.
We first heard about the Field of Reeds — within the context of Moon Knight, that is — in the series’ very first episode.
Over the course of the episode, Marc and/or Steven occasionally get stressed out and disassociate back to Harrow’s office.
The actor who stars as Dr. Grant, Doug Perlin, is a portmanteau of Moon Knight comics’ co-creators Don Perlin and Doug Moench.
