     Hailey Bieber Says She ‘Couldn’t Speak’ During Ministroke
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In March, Bieber confirmed that she had been hospitalized for a blood clot in her brain, telling fans via Instagram stories that she had experienced “strokelike symptoms” and was now at home recovering.
In the video, Bieber recounted her ordeal, explaining how one morning, during breakfast, all of a sudden she felt a shooting pain down her arm, and when her husband, Justin Bieber, asked her if she was alright, she couldn’t respond.
According to Bieber, doctors told her that the blood clot might have been caused by a “perfect storm” combination of birth control pills, a recent bout with COVID, and a recent flight.
Though she is on the mend, Bieber said that she “felt a lot of anxiety” and had a “really really hard time” between her diagnosis and surgery.
The experience definitely sounds terrifying, but it also seems like Bieber was able to pull through with her sense of humor intact.
