     Summary: And, despite the fact that Megan and MGK have solidified themselves as one of Hollywood’s more ~edgy~ couplings , fans couldn’t help but feel as if the design could be communicating some potentially harmful messages about love and pain — particularly in light of the fact that engagement rings originated as a symbol of male ownership.

     Megan Fox has a blood drinking ritual with Machine Gun Kelly and thinks social media is ‘sinister’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Megan Fox would like to clear up what people think about her and fiancé Machine Gun Kelly drinking each other’s blood.
“So, I guess to drink each other’s blood might mislead people or people are imagining us with goblets and we’re like ‘Game of Thrones,’ drinking each other’s blood,” she told Glamour UK.
When she and Kelly do a blood ritual, she said, for her “it’s a passage or it is used for a reason.”“And it is controlled where it’s like, ‘Let’s shed a few drops of blood and each drink it,’” Fox said.
“So nobody’s really interacting with them too much, because they’re just stuck.”Plus, between the two couples there are quite a few children.
According to Fox, she said she “bought a bunch of books that sort of addressed these things and addressed a full spectrum of what this is.

     Megan Fox: "I think I was ahead of the #MeToo movement by almost a decade"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Since her time acting in blockbusters like Michael Bay’s Transformers films and Karyn Kusama’s horror-comedy Jennifer’s Body, Megan Fox has had something of a resurgence in the culture.
AdvertisementAlong with Jennifer’s Body, the perception of Fox stemming from coverage of her during the 2000s has altered, too.
In a recent cover interview with Glamour UK, Fox describes the difficulty she encountered with calling out sexist practices in the 2000s.
“I think that I was ahead of the #MeToo movement by almost a decade,” Fox explains.
“I wasn’t allowed to be a human, because I was a topic of conversation and gossip and punch lines,” Fox adds.

The actress opened up to Chelsea Handler during a 2014 interview on Chelsea Lately about being a new mom of two, including the lack of privacy and decreased time to herself.

You don't sleep.
Every minute is dedicated to someone else, so you don't even get to poop alone."
