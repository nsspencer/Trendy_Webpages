    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today, we welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the family that missed him dearly.
I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence.
Ambassador to the Russian Federation John Sullivan, and many others across our government to ensure that Trevor came home safely.
His safe return is a testament to the priority my Administration places on bringing home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad.
We won’t stop until Paul Whelan and others join Trevor in the loving arms of family and friends.

"Trevor left here, young, virile, in good shape, good condition.
Joey Reed told Muir during an interview on "World News Tonight" Wednesday.
The Reeds said they cried when viewing that footage of their son, who they said looked weak and had trouble walking.
"He looked like he could hardly walk, he looked like he'd been walking shackled," Joey Reed said.

     Summary: U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed is released from Russia in a prisoner swapEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Biden administration and the family of Trevor Reed say the U.S. Marine veteran is out of Russian prison and safely on his way back to the U.S.
Russian Foreign Ministry says Reed was exchanged for jailed pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko in a prisoner swap that took place in an unspecified European country.
Reed was detained during a trip to the country in 2019 and accused of attacking a Moscow police officer.
In an unexpected but welcome turn of events, the family announced on Wednesday that Reed had been released after being wrongfully detained for 985 days.
"We also remain committed to securing the freedom of all U.S. nationals wrongfully detained abroad."

     Trevor Reed, One of Three High-Profile Americans Detained in Russia, Released in a Prisoner Swap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trevor Reed, a U.S. Marine veteran who has been held in Russian custody since 2019, was freed Wednesday in a prisoner swap between the Kremlin and the Biden administration.
Russia’s war in Ukraine, and the increasingly strained diplomatic ties between Russia and the United States put added pressure on the Biden administration to get Reed, and the two other Americans detained in the country out.
“[Reed’s] safe return is a testament to the priority my Administration places on bringing home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad,” Biden added.
Reed’s parents, Joey and Paula Reed, spent years pleading for their son’s release, more recently warning of his deteriorating health.
One senior administration official informed CNN that the exchange was “accelerated” in part due to concerns about Reed’s physical well-being.

     American Trevor Reed released from Russia in prisoner swap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington (CNN) American Trevor Reed , a US citizen and former Marine who had been detained in Russia since 2019, has been released in a prisoner swap.
Reed's release will not impact the US approach to the war in Ukraine, senior administration officials said.
The exchange took place in Turkey on Wednesday, Trevor's parents, Joey and Paula Reed, told CNN.
Trevor Reed, who was detained in Russia for nearly three years, saw Yaroshenko on the tarmac during the prisoner swap but did not say anything to him, according to his father.
Asked by CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday whether he had been surprised by Reed's release given Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Biden said: "I did it."
