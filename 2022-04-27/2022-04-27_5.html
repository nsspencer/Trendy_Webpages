     Statement from President Joe Biden on the Return of Trevor Reed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today, we welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the family that missed him dearly.
I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence.
Ambassador to the Russian Federation John Sullivan, and many others across our government to ensure that Trevor came home safely.
His safe return is a testament to the priority my Administration places on bringing home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad.
We won’t stop until Paul Whelan and others join Trevor in the loving arms of family and friends.

     Summary: U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed is released from Russia in a prisoner swapEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Biden administration and the family of Trevor Reed say the U.S. Marine veteran is out of Russian prison and safely on his way back to the U.S.
Russian Foreign Ministry says Reed was exchanged for jailed pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko in a prisoner swap that took place in an unspecified European country.
Reed was detained during a trip to the country in 2019 and accused of attacking a Moscow police officer.
In an unexpected but welcome turn of events, the family announced on Wednesday that Reed had been released after being wrongfully detained for 985 days.
"We also remain committed to securing the freedom of all U.S. nationals wrongfully detained abroad."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "He's doing better," Reed's father, Joey Reed, told "CBS Evening News" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell on Wednesday afternoon.
Three weeks before his release, Reed's parents demanded Russian authorities provide evidence that he was still alive, citing Reed's "rapidly declining health."
Reed's parents were able to "re-establish indirect contact" a few days later.
And he said that he would give us big hugs back," Paula Reed told O'Donnell.
"Our hearts go out to the Whelan family because we had hoped all along that Trevor and Paul would be brought home together," Paula Reed told O'Donnell.

     Trevor Reed: American released from Russia in prisoner swap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “It’s been (a) very exciting day for the Reed family,” Paula Reed tweeted.
Reed’s release will not impact the US approach to the war in Ukraine, senior administration officials said.
“The first phone call we got, he did not sound like himself,” Paula Reed said Wednesday evening at a news conference outside their home in Granbury, Texas.
The Whelan family expressed happiness at Reed’s release but said it was a day of “varied emotions” and questions for them.
A Moscow court recently extended her detention until May 19, according to Russian state news agency TASS.
