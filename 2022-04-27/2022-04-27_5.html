    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Until a few days ago, Mr. Hwang and his lawyers had thought they would be able to persuade federal authorities not to file criminal charges.
It also increased the scrutiny of the way that Mr. Hwang, who cut his teeth at the pioneering hedge fund Tiger Management, made his bets.
And because the banks effectively held the big blocks of stocks, Archegos and Mr. Hwang avoided having to disclose its large positions to regulators and other investors.
Mr. Hwang knew that Archegos could affect markets simply through the exercise of its buying power, the complaint said.
In June 2020, an Archegos employee asked Mr. Hwang if the rising price of ViacomCBS shares was a “sign of strength.” Mr. Hwang responded: “No.

     Summary: Archegos Capital Management founder Bill Hwang and chief financial officer Patrick Halligan were indicted on securities fraud and racketeering charges Wednesday for what prosecutors said was a massive fraud and manipulation scheme that nearly jeopardized the U.S. financial system.
Archegos collapsed in March 2021, leaving banks with more than $10 billion in losses and sparking calls for more regulatory oversight.
More than $100 billion in stock market value vanished in a matter of days.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadThe owner of Archegos Capital Management was arrested Wednesday on fraud and racketeering charges in connection with the dramatic collapse of the multibillion-dollar private equity firm last year.
AdvertisementHwang and Halligan were arraigned Wednesday afternoon, where they both pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud.
When the firm couldn’t, some banks sold their positions, causing the stocks’ prices to fall even further.
After the investigation, Hwang turned Tiger Asia into a family fund, Archegos.
The donations range from five to seven figures, including $1.2 million to the Museum of the Bible in Washington.

     Archegos owner Bill Hwang and former CFO Halligan plead not guilty to U.S. fraud charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Archegos Capital Management's owner, Bill Hwang, and its former chief financial officer, Patrick Halligan, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to criminal charges filed against them in connection with the implosion of the family office last year.
The charging documents say Hwang and Halligan used leverage to inflate their market positions, which swelled to as much as $160 billion before the scheme came crashing down.
Hwang allegedly used derivative securities that had no public disclosure requirements, which helped shield the size of Archegos' positions in the market.
In 2012, Hwang pleaded guilty in an insider trading case involving two Chinese bank stocks.
Last May, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood disclosed that Hwang had provided the seed funding for her first four ETFs.
