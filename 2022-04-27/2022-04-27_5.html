What are you really willing to sacrifice to do what’s right?"
"Are you willing to dismantle the system that’s designed to serve you?"
By the looks of it, Don't Worry Darling takes a new look at how specific characters decide between pursuing self-serving actions and taking larger-scale responsibility.

     Here's The First Look imagery Of Harry Styles’ Don’t Worry Darling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though Styles is set to make his acting debut with the romantic drama My Policeman, speculation is hotter than ever for his other working project — the Olivia Wilde directed dark feature: Don’t Worry Darling.
With limited casting confirmation and an all too ambiguous plotline, the hype garnered from any mention of Don’t Worry Darling is just about enough to break the internet.
Yet when her face is seen next, wrapped all over with clingfilm as she screams from suffocation, we are prewarned that Don’t Worry Darling is nowhere near as reassuring as its title may imply.
Set to star Styles, Pugh as well as Chris Pine, Layne, Sydney Chandler and Nick Kroll, Don’t Worry Darling proves to be a tale of unhappy housewives, disturbing discoveries and plenty of hidden secrets.
Before its release on September 23rd of this year, you can enjoy the first look visuals below…

     Harry Styles and Florence Pugh leave CinemaCon blushing with steamy new Don't Worry Darling trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first full-length trailer for Don't Worry Darling premiered for audiences at CinemaCon.
The psychological thriller is the second movie from director Olivia Wilde and stars Florence Pugh and Harry Styles as married couple Alice and Jack.
Onstage at the convention, Wilde said that Don’t Worry Darling is reminiscent of "Inception, The Matrix, Truman Show.
She made her directorial debut in 2019 with the high school comedy Booksmart, starring Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, so Don't Worry Darling is a pretty significant change of pace for the filmmaker.
Meanwhile, this will be Styles' first leading role in a movie after he made his debut in 2017's Dunkirk.
