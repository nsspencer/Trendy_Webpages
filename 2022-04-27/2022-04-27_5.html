What are you really willing to sacrifice to do what’s right?"
"Are you willing to dismantle the system that’s designed to serve you?"
By the looks of it, Don't Worry Darling takes a new look at how specific characters decide between pursuing self-serving actions and taking larger-scale responsibility.

     Here's The First Look imagery Of Harry Styles’ Don’t Worry Darling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though Styles is set to make his acting debut with the romantic drama My Policeman, speculation is hotter than ever for his other working project — the Olivia Wilde directed dark feature: Don’t Worry Darling.
With limited casting confirmation and an all too ambiguous plotline, the hype garnered from any mention of Don’t Worry Darling is just about enough to break the internet.
Yet when her face is seen next, wrapped all over with clingfilm as she screams from suffocation, we are prewarned that Don’t Worry Darling is nowhere near as reassuring as its title may imply.
Set to star Styles, Pugh as well as Chris Pine, Layne, Sydney Chandler and Nick Kroll, Don’t Worry Darling proves to be a tale of unhappy housewives, disturbing discoveries and plenty of hidden secrets.
Before its release on September 23rd of this year, you can enjoy the first look visuals below…
