     Olivia Wilde CinemaCon Envelope Mystery: It Was Jason Sudeikis Legal Documents
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EXCLUSIVE, UPDATED: With statement from NATO CinemaCon Managing Director Like something out of a hackneyed Hollywood plot, the mysterious envelope picked up by Don’t Worry Darling director and star Olivia Wilde during her CinemaCon presentation last night for the New Line movie were legal documents from Ted Lasso star Jason Sudeikis.
It is our understanding that the manila envelope marked “personal and confidential,” which was placed onstage, were custody papers from the Emmy winner.
Deadline has reached out to reps for both Wilde and Sudeikis and will update if we receive statements.
CinemaCon Photos: Stars And Sneak Peeks Including Olivia Wilde, Dwayne Johnson, ‘Avatar’ And MoreInitially, Deadline had heard last night that the contents of the envelope were an unsolicited script.
When one is served papers, that is something that is orchestrated by the person who is actually serving legal documents.
