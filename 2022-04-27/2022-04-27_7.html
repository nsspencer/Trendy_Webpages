    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mr. Hwang knew that Archegos could affect markets simply through the exercise of its buying power, the complaint said.
In June 2020, an Archegos employee asked Mr. Hwang if the rising price of ViacomCBS shares was a “sign of strength.” Mr. Hwang responded: “No.
The collapse led to billions in losses for a number of banks, but Credit Suisse incurred the most pain.
Over the past few months, federal authorities have demanded documents from the firm and banks and had meetings and interviews with a number of former employees at Archegos, including Mr. Hwang.
The indictment names two former Archegos employees, Scott Becker and William Tomita, as part of the scheme.

     Summary: Archegos Capital Management founder Bill Hwang and its former chief financial officer, Patrick Halligan, were indicted on securities-fraud and racketeering charges Wednesday in what prosecutors said was a massive fraud and manipulation scheme that nearly jeopardized the U.S. financial system.
Archegos collapsed in March 2021, leaving banks with more than $10 billion in losses and sparking calls for more regulatory oversight.
More than $100 billion in stock market value vanished in a matter of days.

     Archegos owner Bill Hwang and former CFO Halligan plead not guilty to U.S. fraud charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Archegos Capital Management's owner, Bill Hwang, and its former chief financial officer, Patrick Halligan, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to criminal charges filed against them in connection with the implosion of the family office last year.
The charging documents say Hwang and Halligan used leverage to inflate their market positions, which swelled to as much as $160 billion before the scheme came crashing down.
Hwang allegedly used derivative securities that had no public disclosure requirements, which helped shield the size of Archegos' positions in the market.
In 2012, Hwang pleaded guilty in an insider trading case involving two Chinese bank stocks.
Last May, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood disclosed that Hwang had provided the seed funding for her first four ETFs.
