     Brittney Griner Remains In Russia; Trevor Reed Is Released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: US Marine veteran Trevor Reed is on his way home after being released from Russia, where officials said he was wrongfully detained since 2019.
“Today, our prayers have been answered and Trevor is safely on his way back to the United States,” his family said in a statement.
The surprise prisoner exchange was the result of long and difficult negotiations between the US and Russia, according to both countries.
Reed’s family said Biden’s decision to go ahead with the prisoner swap may have saved the former marine’s life.
The State Department has previously declined to identify exactly how many Americans have been detained in Russia, but there are at least two high-profile prisoners who remain behind bars there: Paul Whelan and WNBA star Brittney Griner.

     After Russia Releases Trevor Reed, Americans Ask Where Is Brittney Griner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The release of Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine who had been detained in Russia for three years, is strengthening calls on social media that highlight Moscow’s imprisonment of women’s basketball star Brittney Griner, who has been held since February.
U.S. President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Wednesday that Reed was heading back to the U.S., though he’s likely to go to a hospital after his ordeal.
The U.S. negotiated a trade for Reed and a Russian national who had been convicted in the U.S. on drug trafficking conspiracy charges.
In a tweet, Biden said that “Trevor’s safe return is a testament to the priority we place on bringing home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad.” In other remarks, he said that the U.S. “won’t stop” until other detained Americans are returned home.
