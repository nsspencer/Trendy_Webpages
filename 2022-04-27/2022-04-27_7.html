     Summary: New York (CNN Business) Meta's first earnings of 2022 may have largely fallen short of expectations, but that hasn't really dampened the enthusiasm of its investors.
Meta also lowered its projections for total expenses for the year, adjusting the upper limit of its expected spending from $95 billion to $92 billion.
The company reported total quarterly revenue up 7% year-over-year to $27.9 billion, and net income of nearly $7.5 billion, or $2.72 per share.
In the first quarter of 2022, the Reality Labs unit posted a loss of nearly $3 billion during the quarter.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meta Platforms Inc. is the latest tech giant to feel an economic pinch, as Facebook’s parent company reported its slowest sales growth in a decade Wednesday and issued lukewarm revenue guidance.
Earnings beat the average forecast for profit of $2.56 a share, but sales fell short of the consensus of $28.3 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet.
Meta issued a second-quarter revenue forecast of $28 billion to $30 billion, while analysts were forecasting $30.7 billion.
Daily active users, or DAUs, a crucial metric for Meta’s growth globally, increased 4% to 1.96 billion, topping analyst expectations of 1.95 billion.
“The growth in (DAUs) is a good sign for Facebook, especially coming off of Q4 2021 when it experienced its first-ever decline in DAUs.

     Meta Platforms Stock: Avoid This Value Trap In 2022 (NASDAQ:FB)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That being said, multiple headwinds are facing their line of operations such as IOS changes, a strong U.S dollar hindering international revenue growth, and employee growth exceeding revenue growth.
Data by YChartsSource: YChartsMeta Platforms: The Company In Which Rewards Staff, Not ShareholdersThrough the years 2012-2021, Meta Platforms had bought a total of $91 billion worth of stock.
Therefore, I am of the opinion that the comparison of total employee and total revenue growth could become a precursor for underperforming annual EPS growth.
Smart Money Is CapitulatingLastly, I'd also like to mention that it appears even smart money is capitulating on Meta Platforms.
Meta Platforms is going to be fighting a massive uphill battle in 2022 with regulatory, consumer, macroeconomic, and competitive hurdles.
