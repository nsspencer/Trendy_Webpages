     Archegos stock manipulation scheme was ‘historic,’ U.S. attorney says.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Archegos used a complex security sold by banks called a total return swap, allowing Mr. Hwang to wager on the movement of stocks without buying them.
And because the banks held the big blocks of stocks, Archegos and Mr. Hwang avoided having to disclose its large positions to regulators and other investors.
Mr. Hwang knew that Archegos could affect markets simply through the exercise of its buying power, the complaint said.
In June 2020, an Archegos employee asked Mr. Hwang if the rising price of ViacomCBS shares was a “sign of strength.” Mr. Hwang responded: “No.
The effective size of the firm’s stock positions swelled to $160 billion from $10 billion, rivaling some of the biggest hedge funds in the world.

     Archegos owner Bill Hwang and its former CFO Halligan plead not guilty to U.S. fraud charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Archegos Capital Management's owner, Bill Hwang, and its former chief financial officer, Patrick Halligan, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to criminal charges filed against them in connection with the implosion of the family office last year.
Hwang allegedly used derivative securities that had no public disclosure requirements, which helped shield the size of Archegos' positions in the market.
The family office focused on a handful of companies that included media companies ViacomCBS and Discovery Communications and Chinese education technology company GSX Techedu, among others.
Credit Suisse suffered the most, tallying some $5 billion in losses, when the family office collapsed.
In 2012, Hwang pleaded guilty in an insider trading case involving two Chinese bank stocks.
