     After Russia Releases Trevor Reed, Americans Ask Where Is Brittney Griner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The release of Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine who had been detained in Russia for three years, is strengthening calls on social media that highlight Moscow’s imprisonment of women’s basketball star Brittney Griner, who has been held since February.
U.S. President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Wednesday that Reed was heading back to the U.S., though he’s likely to go to a hospital after his ordeal.
The U.S. negotiated a trade for Reed and a Russian national who had been convicted in the U.S. on drug trafficking conspiracy charges.
In a tweet, Biden said that “Trevor’s safe return is a testament to the priority we place on bringing home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad.” In other remarks, he said that the U.S. “won’t stop” until other detained Americans are returned home.
