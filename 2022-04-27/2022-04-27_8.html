     ‘The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes’ Review: Gossip Girl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you call a movie “The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes,” your job is to provide at least something worth listening to.
This documentary, directed by Emma Cooper in the latest addition to Netflix’s catalog of true-crime (or crime-ish) stories, begins by teasing some sort of conspiracy surrounding Marilyn Monroe’s 1962 death from an overdose.
But mostly the film presents a banal rehash of established facts and well-circulated rumors about Monroe’s life.
The tapes in question are the interviews that the Irish journalist Anthony Summers recorded while researching Monroe; he published his conclusions in the 1985 book “Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe.” The movie version adds the ostensible perk of hearing the real voices of John Huston, Jane Russell and Billy Wilder, among others, as actors lip-sync to their remembrances — which, again, are mostly footnotes.

     'The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe' revisits her life and death 60 years later through unheard tapes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Hello again, Norma Jean, as the 60th anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death brings renewed opportunities to revisit her life and legacy, without really bringing anything substantially new to the party.
"The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes" has one hook in recorded interviews with those who knew her, but offsets that with a clumsy device to illustrate those conversations.
The recordings come courtesy of Anthony Summers , author of the 1985 book about Monroe, "Goddess."
Given that there's plenty of video and film footage of Monroe to weave in, it's an indulgence that's far too cute for its own good, adding a sense of showbiz pizzazz that does nothing to buttress the project's credibility.
Inevitably, that conversation turns to Monroe's reported relationships with John and Robert F. Kennedy, the subject of a seemingly endless number of documentaries and salacious (mostly TV) movies through the years.

     What Separates Netflix’s New Marilyn Monroe Documentary From the Rest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sixty years after Marilyn Monroe’s death, there isn’t much new to say about the icon or her tragic passing at age 36—as scandalous as the sex symbol’s final days were.
The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes, premiering Wednesday on Netflix, uses them to construct another portrait of Monroe.
And I really found that to be true here.”Marilyn Monroe has been the subject of endless documentaries, books, and TV coverage—including Reframed: Marilyn Monroe, a docuseries from earlier this year that intended to give Monroe more agency over her career.
While The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes won’t turn up any new reporting, it is a fascinating listen for true-crime fans or anyone interested in celebrity investigations.
I thought it was really, really compelling that that lives in Marilyn Monroe, because she’s the last person that you would think that would happen to.”Cooper hopes audiences can learn something new from hearing firsthand reports told by some of the people closest to Monroe.

     The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe Illuminates Her Sadness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Those taped interviews, never available to the public, have been dramatized and shaped into the documentary The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes, directed by Emma Cooper and featuring Summers as a guide.
Marilyn Monroe in The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes Courtesy of NetflixSummers’ methods and conclusions are sound, and as a reporter retracing the steps he took 40 years ago, he shows a suitable degree of respect, and sometimes even anguish, for his subject.
But much of The Mystery of Marilyn leaves an unpleasant aftertaste.
And no one who loves Marilyn Monroe, or even just the image of Marilyn that we know, is likely to pass judgment on her for anything she did on her way to becoming a star.
Still, I came away from The Mystery of Marilyn feeling not just incredibly sad but also a little dirty.

     Netflix Documentary Alleges Bobby Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe Fought The Night of Her Death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix’s new documentary, The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes, which began streaming today, doesn’t exactly come to any new conclusions.
The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe uses the real audio—reenacted by actors— from over 650 taped recorded interviews conducted by journalist Anthony Summer, whose 1985 biography, Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe, was a New York Times bestseller.
Marilyn Monroe died of a drug overdose of barbiturates at her Los Angeles home on August 4, 1962.
Nothing in The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe questions how Monroe died, but Summer does spend copious time questioning when she died.

     How Did Marilyn Monroe Die? A Netflix Doc Uncovers New Details
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eunice Murray, Marilyn's housekeeper, told the Times that she became worried when Marilyn didn’t respond to knocks on her bedroom door.
She reportedly called Marilyn’s psychiatrist Ralph Greenson, who came to the house and broke a window to access Marilyn’s room.
Marilyn was pronounced dead, but police weren’t called until 4:20 a.m., about an hour after Murray had initially called Greenson.
Writer John Sherlock also says in the doc that Greenson told him Marilyn was alive at home and died on the way to the hospital.
The official word is that Marilyn died of an overdose.
