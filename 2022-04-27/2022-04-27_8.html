     World's first H3N8 Bird Flu Human infection reported in China
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A four-year-old boy from central Henan province in China has been reported as the first human case of H3N8 bird flu infection by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) in its press release.
Bird flu or avian flu is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds but in rare cases, also affects humans.
Last year, the NHC confirmed the first human infection with the H10N3 bird flu, even though there was no subsequent human-human transmission of the virus later on.
The virus has spread globally and has been found in poultry, seals, dogs, and also horses but this is the first reported case of human infection.
Last year, the first human infection of the H5N8 variant of the virus was detected in Russia.

     China detects first human case of H3N8 bird flu strain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An H3N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in humans for the first time, in China’s central province of Henan.
The four-year-old boy infected had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, according to reports from China’s National Health Commission.
Avian influenza or bird flu as it is commonly known is a highly contagious viral disease with the first reports of human cases in the 1990s.
Some strains of the bird flu, such as with H3N8 now, have been passed to humans but this is currently very rare, and usually occurs after very close contact with infected birds or animals.
H3N8 viruses circulate widely in birds and in horses and have also been detected in dogs in North America.

     What is H3N8 bird flu whose first human case was reported in China?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first case of H3N8 bird flu in a human has been reported from China.
China's central province of Henan has reported the first human infection of the H3N8 strain of bird flu.
H3N8 is a type of canine influenza, which is also known as dog flu.
The first cases of canine influenza from H3N8 were reported in 2004 as it emerged in greyhounds in the United States.
Whole-genome sequence analyses indicate that the H3N8 virus in this human case is a reassortant, with genes from viruses that have been detected previously in poultry and wild birds.
