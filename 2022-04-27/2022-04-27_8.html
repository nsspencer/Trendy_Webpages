     First Look At Margot Robbie As Barbie Revealed By Warner Bros.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fans of the long-awaited Barbie film can get ready to head to Malibu, as Warner Bros. Pictures has finally shared a small first look at the new version of the iconic character.
The project was moved from Sony to Warner Bros., and names like Amy Schumer and Anne Hathaway were in talks to star before finally settling on Margot Robbie as the title character in 2019.
What was given at CinemaCon 2022, is an extensive list of supporting cast with some huge names, a release date, and perhaps the most important element-- a real look at what Robbie will look like as Barbie.
The film is of course based on the eternally popular Mattel character, Barbie.
While originally just a blonde doll named Barbie introduced in 1959, the character has exploded into a media giant.
