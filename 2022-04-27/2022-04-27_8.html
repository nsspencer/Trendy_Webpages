     Facebook parent Meta Platforms is a ‘classic dislocated high quality stock,’ analyst says after latest earnings report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first-quarter results from Meta Platforms weren’t really anything to write home about, and neither was the guidance — but the stock might be too cheap.
That’s the takeaway from Mark Mahaney, analyst at Evercore ISI, as first-quarter sales lagged expectations.
Meta Platforms FB, -3.32% shares rallied 17% in the premarket to $204.03.
According to FactSet, the average analyst target price is $295.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York (CNN Business) Meta's first earnings of 2022 may have largely fallen short of expectations, but that hasn't really dampened the enthusiasm of its investors.
Meta also lowered its projections for total expenses for the year, adjusting the upper limit of its expected spending from $95 billion to $92 billion.
The company reported total quarterly revenue up 7% year-over-year to $27.9 billion, and net income of nearly $7.5 billion, or $2.72 per share.
In the first quarter of 2022, the Reality Labs unit posted a loss of nearly $3 billion during the quarter.

     Meta Platforms Stock: Avoid This Value Trap In 2022 (NASDAQ:FB)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That being said, multiple headwinds are facing their line of operations such as IOS changes, a strong U.S dollar hindering international revenue growth, and employee growth exceeding revenue growth.
Data by YChartsSource: YChartsMeta Platforms: The Company In Which Rewards Staff, Not ShareholdersThrough the years 2012-2021, Meta Platforms had bought a total of $91 billion worth of stock.
Therefore, I am of the opinion that the comparison of total employee and total revenue growth could become a precursor for underperforming annual EPS growth.
Smart Money Is CapitulatingLastly, I'd also like to mention that it appears even smart money is capitulating on Meta Platforms.
Meta Platforms is going to be fighting a massive uphill battle in 2022 with regulatory, consumer, macroeconomic, and competitive hurdles.
