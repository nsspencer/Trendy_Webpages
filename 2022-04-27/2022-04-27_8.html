     China detects first human case of H3N8 bird flu strain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An H3N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in humans for the first time, in China’s central province of Henan.
The four-year-old boy infected had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, according to reports from China’s National Health Commission.
Avian influenza or bird flu as it is commonly known is a highly contagious viral disease with the first reports of human cases in the 1990s.
Some strains of the bird flu, such as with H3N8 now, have been passed to humans but this is currently very rare, and usually occurs after very close contact with infected birds or animals.
H3N8 viruses circulate widely in birds and in horses and have also been detected in dogs in North America.

H3N8 is a flu strain that has been detected before in horses, dogs, birds, and seals around the world.
Last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported an increase in the number of human H5N6 bird flu infection cases in China according to Reuters; 21, compared to five the year prior.
Bird flu can also be devastating for bird populations.
The U.S. is currently experiencing a bird flu epidemic of the H5N1 strain that has resulted in nearly 27 million chickens and turkeys having to be killed in 30 states, according to CNET.

     What is H3N8 bird flu whose first human case was reported in China?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first case of H3N8 bird flu in a human has been reported from China.
China's central province of Henan has reported the first human infection of the H3N8 strain of bird flu.
H3N8 is a type of canine influenza, which is also known as dog flu.
The first cases of canine influenza from H3N8 were reported in 2004 as it emerged in greyhounds in the United States.
Whole-genome sequence analyses indicate that the H3N8 virus in this human case is a reassortant, with genes from viruses that have been detected previously in poultry and wild birds.

Bird flu is thought to kill up to half of those it infects, the NHC added.
The H3N8 variant — one of several types of bird flu — is common in horses and dogs and has even been found in seals.
Bird flu, or avian flu, is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among bird species but can, on rare occasions, jump to human beings.
Bird flu is spread by close contact with an infected bird or the body of one.
