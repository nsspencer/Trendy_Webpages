     Summary: The 2022 NBA playoffs have been anything but a cakewalk for the Phoenix Suns, though they have taken back the lead in their first-round series against the New Orleans Pelicans.
Chris Paul shined as he helped the Devin Booker-less Suns take a 3-2 advantage but he has yet to shake himself free of Jose Alvarado, the undrafted Pelicans rookie whose job is to stick to ball-handlers like white on rice.
Paul received a technical foul after Alvarado forced him into an eight-second violation for the second game in a row.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Orleans Pelicans rookie Jose Alvarado has frustrated the Phoenix Suns throughout their first-round series, and the undrafted guard has earned plenty of recognition on a national stage.
However, his defense and energy off the bench has bothered the Suns and given Paul problems in each game.
Alvarado pulled off his ‚ÄúGrand Theft Alvarado‚Äù trick on Paul after sneaking up from behind and poking the ball loose in Game 4.
He also forced an eight-second violation on Paul that proved vital in pulling out the win in that game.
Alvarado became a fan favorite throughout the season in New Orleans given his performance on a nightly basis.

     Jose Alvarado Is A Delightful Pest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: All of which is to say that it is very impressive indeed that Jose Alvarado has now spent five games out-pesting Chris Paul.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve enjoyed watching any other player play defense as much as I have Alvarado this postseason.
The Pelicans lost last night despite his best efforts, as the Suns locked in and suffocated the Pelicans offense.
But Alvarado has the guts and talent to stay with him a lot of the time, and unburdened from the responsibilities of running an offense, Alvarado is liberated to use all his energy getting under Paul‚Äôs skin.
I consider it a perverse sign of success that Alvarado got Paul so mad he had to kick him in the dick and balls.
