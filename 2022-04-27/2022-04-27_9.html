     ‘The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes’ Review: Gossip Girl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you call a movie “The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes,” your job is to provide at least something worth listening to.
This documentary, directed by Emma Cooper in the latest addition to Netflix’s catalog of true-crime (or crime-ish) stories, begins by teasing some sort of conspiracy surrounding Marilyn Monroe’s 1962 death from an overdose.
But mostly the film presents a banal rehash of established facts and well-circulated rumors about Monroe’s life.
The tapes in question are the interviews that the Irish journalist Anthony Summers recorded while researching Monroe; he published his conclusions in the 1985 book “Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe.” The movie version adds the ostensible perk of hearing the real voices of John Huston, Jane Russell and Billy Wilder, among others, as actors lip-sync to their remembrances — which, again, are mostly footnotes.

     Marilyn Monroe's Last Hours, More Detailed in The Unheard Tapes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch : Remembering Marilyn Monroe 58 Years Later: E!
News RewindFor the past 60 years, it's been impossible to separate Marilyn Monroe's longevity as a superstar from her death.
And yet it's the cultural punch she packed when she was alive—radiating beauty and charisma from the screen while her tumultuous personal life perpetually overshadowed her serious acting ability—that made people obsessed with her untimely demise.
In turn, ever since a 36-year-old Monroe was found dead—or was she?—at her Brentwood home on Aug. 5, 1962, for many there's been a mystery to be solved along with a flesh-and-blood person to be mourned.
There isn't much about the woman born Norma Jeane Mortenson that hasn't been thoroughly parsed, from her childhood bouncing between foster homes and never knowing her father to her longing to have a child of her own to her affairs with men in very high places and the subsequent conspiracy theories that her love life got her killed.

     'The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe' revisits her life and death 60 years later through unheard tapes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Hello again, Norma Jean, as the 60th anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death brings renewed opportunities to revisit her life and legacy, without really bringing anything substantially new to the party.
"The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes" has one hook in recorded interviews with those who knew her, but offsets that with a clumsy device to illustrate those conversations.
The recordings come courtesy of Anthony Summers , author of the 1985 book about Monroe, "Goddess."
Given that there's plenty of video and film footage of Monroe to weave in, it's an indulgence that's far too cute for its own good, adding a sense of showbiz pizzazz that does nothing to buttress the project's credibility.
Inevitably, that conversation turns to Monroe's reported relationships with John and Robert F. Kennedy, the subject of a seemingly endless number of documentaries and salacious (mostly TV) movies through the years.

     What Separates Netflix’s New Marilyn Monroe Documentary From the Rest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sixty years after Marilyn Monroe’s death, there isn’t much new to say about the icon or her tragic passing at age 36—as scandalous as the sex symbol’s final days were.
The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes, premiering Wednesday on Netflix, uses them to construct another portrait of Monroe.
And I really found that to be true here.”Marilyn Monroe has been the subject of endless documentaries, books, and TV coverage—including Reframed: Marilyn Monroe, a docuseries from earlier this year that intended to give Monroe more agency over her career.
While The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes won’t turn up any new reporting, it is a fascinating listen for true-crime fans or anyone interested in celebrity investigations.
I thought it was really, really compelling that that lives in Marilyn Monroe, because she’s the last person that you would think that would happen to.”Cooper hopes audiences can learn something new from hearing firsthand reports told by some of the people closest to Monroe.

     Netflix Marilyn Monroe Documentary Is A Fascinating Deep Dive Into the Icon’s Death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marilyn Monroe died of a drug overdose on August 4, 1962, in her Los Angeles home.
Nothing in Summer’s book, or this new documentary, disputes that, but it does spend a copious amount of time piecing together the timeline of her death.
Several say that she was also having an affair with John Kennedy, aka the President of the United States.
That she felt used by the Kennedys, and many other men in her life, is made more than clear.
The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe is a fascinating, if depressing, reminder of that.
