     Monty Williams on Mikal Bridges: “You can’t clone him, but you wish you could”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mikal Bridges stepped up big time for the Suns in absence on Devin Booker.
The 25-year-old small forward who is regarded as one of the best defenders in the NBA showcased his offensive talent as well.
He played team-high 47 minutes (Chris Paul was second with 39) and was the top scorer for Phoenix with 31 points.
“You can’t clone him, but you wish you could,” Suns head coach Monty Williams said of Bridges postgame.
He’s just one of those rare basketball players that can play that way on defense, but also give you the point production that he gave tonight.”

     Summary: Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty ImagesMikal Bridges, welcome to the land of NBA Twitter playoff hyperbole.
But it was his lockdown defense on CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram that drew the overwhelming amount of applause.
The four-year, $90 million contract extension Bridges signed with the Suns before the season is already looking like a bargain.
"You can't clone him, but you wish you could," Suns coach Monty Williams said after the game.
Phoenix struggled to generate offense in Game 4 without its leading scorer but seemed to find a rhythm on the back of Bridges in Game 5.

In his four years as an NBA player, Bridges hasn’t missed a game.
"It's very unique, I haven't played a game in a Suns uniform without Kal" Chris Paul gives Mikal Bridges his flowers following Mikal's high caliber performance and work ethic.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the Suns desperate for improved 3-point shooting, Bridges made all four of his attempts.
Bridges finished the game with two emphatic dunks, showing no sign of any fatigue, an energy flow vital for the Suns.
The Pelicans might need to come up with a game plan to manage Bridges in Thursday's Game 6.
He was a vital cog in everything the Suns did as he took his second-most shots in a game this season.
Bridges played more against Pelicans star Brandon Ingram than any other time in the series, and Ingram was just 1-of-4 shooting with Bridges defending him.

     Summary: Suns coach Monty Williams on Tuesday said he wished he could clone Mikal Bridges.
And Williams didn’t say that because Bridges played all but 66 seconds of the Suns’ 112-97 win that gave Phoenix a 3-2 lead heading into Thursday’s game at New Orleans.
He said it because Bridges did all those things, in one night, during the most crucial game of the Suns’ season.
“We put him on everybody,” Williams said of his Bridges’ defense.
But really, everybody knew exactly why the Suns regained control of this series: It was Bridges, the guy they wished they could clone.
