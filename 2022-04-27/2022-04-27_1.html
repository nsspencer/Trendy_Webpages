     Soccer-Liverpool breeze past Villarreal to close in on Champions League final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) – An own goal and a Sadio Mane strike earned Liverpool a 2-0 victory in their Champions League semi-final first-leg against Villarreal on Wednesday, putting Juergen Klopp’s side on course for their third European Cup final in five seasons.
Villarreal defended in numbers in the first half to frustrate the six-times European Cup winners, with Thiago Alcantara going closest to breaking the deadlock with a thunderous strike from distance that hit the post.
Able to express themselves with the deadlock broken, Mohamed Salah threaded a sublime pass through for Mane to put the game beyond the visitors 133 seconds later.
Liverpool had chances to make the result more comprehensive, but will be firm favourites to finish the job in next week’s second leg in Spain.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With a 2–0 win over Villarreal in the Champions League semifinal first leg, Liverpool took another step toward a historic quadruple.
From the very beginning, Liverpool showed that it wasn’t going to be the next titan to be shocked by Villarreal.
While the first half remained goalless, Liverpool outshot Villarreal, 12–1.
In the 50th minute, Liverpool seemed to take the lead with a Fabinho goal that was then disallowed for a Virgil van Dijk offside.
The Egyptian star slipped a perfectly weighted passed through the Villarreal defense as Mané deftly poked it past Rulli for the 2–0 lead.

But Liverpool did enough to build themselves a solid lead for Tuesday's return game in Spain where they will be confident of finishing off the job.
There were several half-chances for Liverpool with Jordan Henderson drilling into the side netting and Mohamed Salah floating an effort wide, while Mane saw a deflected effort zip just past the post.
Liverpool's pressing was too much for the Spaniards at times and they had chances to make the result more comprehensive.
But the game is still alive and it will be tough in Villarreal."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The idea of a first XI is perhaps a little old-fashioned, but a pattern is emerging in Jürgen Klopp’s selections.
Liverpool needed all of that variety to break down a typically stubborn Villarreal.
Whereas Bayern delivered cross after cross into the box, Liverpool had far greater invention.
Not for the first time in recent years, the physical difference between the Premier League and La Liga was clear.
It’s not just that the lead is two goals, it’s that it’s extremely difficult to see how Villarreal could get three against this Liverpool without conceding.

According to official UEFA statistics, Liverpool had 93 attacks (Villarreal managed just 15) and completed 645 passes as opposed to 182 by Emery's team.
Liverpool are one game away from booking their spot in the Champions League final.
"[Liverpool] are going to suffer more than tonight in Villarreal," Emery said after this game.
