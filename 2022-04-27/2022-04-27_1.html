     Margot Robbie's Barbie movie gets official first look and release date
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Barbie is officially arriving on the big screen next summer – the upcoming live-action movie now has a release date of July 21, 2023 (the same day as Christopher Nolan's next movie, Oppenheimer, if you fancy a double bill…).
The release date was announced by Warner Bros. at CinemaCon and the studio also revealed the first official look at the movie, in which Margot Robbie plays the titular doll, while Ryan Gosling is playing her beau Ken.
The first look image shows Robbie in a blue get-up grinning from the driver's seat of Barbie's classic pink convertible.
Barbie will be directed by Greta Gerwig, her first movie since 2019's Little Women .
However, according to The Hollywood Reporter , the movie will have a meta element – we imagine Ferrell's role will have something to do with that.

     Our First Look at Margot Robbie in the Upcoming 'Barbie' Movie
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Not only did we get a solid release date for the upcoming Barbie movie, starring Margot Robbie, we also got our very first look at Robbie in her dream role (and dream car).
In addition to Robbie starring as the titular Barbie, the movie features Ryan Gosling as Ken.
Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach are writing the screenplay, and Gerwig is directing.
Considering the star power behind this movie -- Robbie is very selective with the parts she takes -- could this movie be... awesome?
According to the official Warner Bros. Pictures account, the movie will hit cinemas July 21, 2023.
