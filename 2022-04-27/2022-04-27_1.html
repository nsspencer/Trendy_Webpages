     LeBron James Reacts to Warriors Eliminating Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It took a significant amount of effort down the stretch, but the Golden State Warriors finished Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets in five games.
The Warriors will now await the outcome of Memphis vs. Minnesota to find out who their next opponent would be.
As previously mentioned, Gary Payton II was crucial down the stretch for Golden State, hitting big time shots in the 4th quarter.
The Warriors almost did not bring him aboard, as it came down to a decision between Payton or Avery Bradley.
The winner of that series will take on Golden State in the Western Conference Semi-Finals.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Golden State revealed its starting lineup about 30 minutes before tip-off of Game 5 of the first-round series against the Denver Nuggets at Chase Center.
The news came two days after Curry played 37 minutes in the Warriors’ Game 4 loss, which sent the best-of-seven series back to the Bay Area.
Curry will start alongside Klay Thompson, Jordan Poole, Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green.
With all signs pointing to Curry returning to the starting lineup, Nuggets coach Michael Malone said his team’s gameplan wouldn’t change.
“It feels good knowing everything is moving in the right direction managing the injury,” Curry said Tuesday after practice.

     Stephen Curry has 30 in first start of playoffs as Golden State Warriors oust Denver Nuggets in 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (0:16)SAN FRANCISCO -- Stephen Curry dribbled through nearly the entire Denver Nuggets team before putting up the perfect tear-drop layup to put the Warriors up by five with 29.9 seconds left in the game Wednesday night.
The Warriors advance to face the winner of the Timberwolves-Grizzlies series, with Game 1 happening as soon as Sunday.
For the first 30 minutes Wednesday night against the Nuggets, the Warriors looked lifeless, and Chase Center was nearly dead.
Curry led the Warriors with 30 points on 10-of-22 shooting, including five 3-pointers in 38 minutes.
Not in the sense that it was win-or-go-home, but in a way that was clear they couldn't give this Nuggets team, which has made two improbable playoff comebacks before, any more life and go back to Denver.

     Warriors observations: Steph Curry eliminates Nuggets with clutch Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That was the case Wednesday night with the Warriors outlasting the Denver Nuggets 102-98 in Game 5 of their first-round playoff series to advance to the Western Conference semifinals.
Steve Kerr brought Steph Curry back to the starting lineup, and the Warriors went small right away, also starting Jordan Poole, Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green.
Steph The StarterThe four-game experiment of Curry taking a seat and being the scariest Sixth Man the game has ever seen came to an end Wednesday night in Game 5.
One stat to remember: The Nuggets had 14 offensive rebounds and the Warriors had six.
But in the fourth quarter, the Warriors had two and the Nuggets didn't grab a single one.

     Summary: The Warriors wrapped up their first round series against the Nuggets on Wednesday night, advancing to the Western Conference semifinals with a 102-98 win.
If the Timberwolves win and force Game 7, then the Warriors won’t start their second round series until Tuesday.
Now that the Warriors have advanced, the Grizzlies may be the team they’d least like to see.
Memphis went 3-1 against Golden State this year, including handing the Warriors their first loss of the season at the Chase Center in late October.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The third-seeded Golden State Warriors look to send off the injury-ravaged Denver Nuggets in five games later Wednesday night, and it brings me no small amount of pleasure to report that the Warriors look like the Warriors again—specifically this era’s first, cool Warriors.
When those Warriors won their 73rd game, Jayson Tatum was about to graduate from high school, and Ja Morant hadn’t yet turned 17.
AdvertisementAdvertisementThis Warriors team obviously isn’t identical to the 2015 and 2016 gangs.
The mid-2010s Warriors teams became famous for their “Death Lineup,” a devastating small-ball fivesome featuring Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Barnes, Iguodala, and Draymond Green at center.
(This came to bear in 2019, Durant’s last year with the team, when a Warriors team missing KD and Klay Thompson lost the championship in six games to the Toronto Raptors.)

Jokic exited the game in the fourth quarter to ride a stationary bike behind the Nuggets' bench for several minutes before returning to the court.

     Warriors vs. Nuggets score, takeaways: Golden State survives Nikola Jokic, Denver in Game 5 to clinch series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors are moving on to the Western Conference semifinals after beating Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets 102-98 in Game 5 to clinch their first-round series.
Before Cousins arrived in January, the Nuggets were outscored by 217 points in the 823 minutes they'd played without Jokic.
He was at his best in Game 5, scoring 19 points on 8-of-12 shooting to keep Denver afloat in the minutes Jokic had to rest.
For the series as a whole, the Nuggets actually won the minutes Cousins played by three.
You could argue that Anderson Varejao's excessive minutes in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals cost Golden State a championship.
