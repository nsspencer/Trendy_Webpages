     Nuggets Starting Lineup For Game 5 Against Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Nuggets have announced their starting lineup for Game 5 against the Golden State Warriors.
The Denver Nuggets are in San Francisco to take on the Golden State Warriors for Game 5 of their first-round playoff series on Wednesday evening.
They are currently in a 3-1 hole, so every game the rest of the way is an elimination game.
For Game 5, they have announced their starting lineup as relayed by Underdog NBA.
Unfortunately, the Nuggets are not at full strength as two of their three best players have not played a single game in the series.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Warriors' first NBA playoff series in nearly three calendar years went as well as they could have imagined.
The Warriors trailed for most of the second half of Game 5, but rallied in the fourth quarter to pull out the thrilling win.
2 seeded Memphis Grizzlies and the No.
If the Grizzlies win Game 6 on Friday night, Game 1 against the Warriors would take place Sunday at 12:30 p.m. PT in Memphis.
While the Nuggets won three of the four regular-season matchups against the Warriors, Draymond Green missed all of those games.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With 15 points in 26 minutes of play, Payton II proved to be a key component to Golden State’s 102-98 Game 5 win that clinched its first round series over the Nuggets.
Starting with his smothering style of defense, Payton II was able to record 2 steals against a Nuggets team that committed 14 turnovers in the game.
Considering the series against Denver was his first-ever experience playing in the NBA Playoffs, Payton II appeared to be a veteran on the floor.
Knocking down a 3-pointer in the corner, he gave Golden State an 86-84 lead with 6:57 to play.
Undoubtedly, though, Game 5 showed just what Gary Payton II could produce for a Golden State franchise on the hunt for another championship this season.

     Summary: (0:16)SAN FRANCISCO -- Stephen Curry dribbled through nearly the entire Denver Nuggets team before making the perfect teardrop layup to put the Golden State Warriors up with 30 seconds left in the game.
But for the first 30 minutes of Game 5 against the Nuggets, the Warriors looked lifeless.
At the 6:20 mark of the third quarter, Green hit a 26-foot 3-pointer to bring the Warriors within six of Denver.
Thompson added 15 points, while Green had 11 points, six assists, three blocks and a steal.
The Warriors let Denver stick around more than they wanted to in Game 5, but ultimately, they achieved their goal.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors are moving on to the Western Conference semifinals after beating Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets 102-98 in Game 5 to clinch their first-round series.
Before Cousins arrived in January, the Nuggets were outscored by 217 points in the 823 minutes they'd played without Jokic.
He was at his best in Game 5, scoring 19 points on 8-of-12 shooting to keep Denver afloat in the minutes Jokic had to rest.
For the series as a whole, the Nuggets actually won the minutes Cousins played by three.
You could argue that Anderson Varejao's excessive minutes in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals cost Golden State a championship.

     These Awesome New Warriors Are Catharsis for the Whole NBA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The third-seeded Golden State Warriors look to send off the injury-ravaged Denver Nuggets in five games later Wednesday night, and it brings me no small amount of pleasure to report that the Warriors look like the Warriors again—specifically this era’s first, cool Warriors.
When those Warriors won their 73rd game, Jayson Tatum was about to graduate from high school, and Ja Morant hadn’t yet turned 17.
AdvertisementAdvertisementThis Warriors team obviously isn’t identical to the 2015 and 2016 gangs.
The mid-2010s Warriors teams became famous for their “Death Lineup,” a devastating small-ball fivesome featuring Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Barnes, Iguodala, and Draymond Green at center.
(This came to bear in 2019, Durant’s last year with the team, when a Warriors team missing KD and Klay Thompson lost the championship in six games to the Toronto Raptors.)

Curry came into the fourth quarter at the 8:48 mark with the Warriors down 83-79.
Every time the Warriors tried to hit them with one final knockout punch, they got back up and returned the favor.
The Nuggets tried to send a bigger body his way, and instead of leaning back, he put his foot on the gas and got to the basket.
"Fourth quarter, yeah, you could tell -- it was kind of a collective anxiousness in there, and a great celebration afterwards.
