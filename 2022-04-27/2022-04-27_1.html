     Summary: Today, we welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the family that missed him dearly.
I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence.
Ambassador to the Russian Federation John Sullivan, and many others across our government to ensure that Trevor came home safely.
His safe return is a testament to the priority my Administration places on bringing home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad.
We won’t stop until Paul Whelan and others join Trevor in the loving arms of family and friends.

     Russia releases US Marine vet Trevor Reed as part of prisoner exchange
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As part of the exchange, Russia released Trevor Reed, a former Marine from Texas who was arrested in the summer of 2019 after Russian authorities said he assaulted an officer while being driven by police to a police station following a night of heavy drinking.
Reed was later sentenced to nine years in prison, though his family has maintained his innocence and the U.S. government has described him as unjustly detained.
"I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence.
And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s freedom," Biden's statement said.

     Summary: U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed is released from Russia in a prisoner swapEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Biden administration and the family of Trevor Reed say the U.S. Marine veteran is out of Russian prison and safely on his way back to the U.S.
Russian Foreign Ministry says Reed was exchanged for jailed pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko in a prisoner swap that took place in an unspecified European country.
Reed was detained during a trip to the country in 2019 and accused of attacking a Moscow police officer.
In an unexpected but welcome turn of events, the family announced on Wednesday that Reed had been released after being wrongfully detained for 985 days.
"We also remain committed to securing the freedom of all U.S. nationals wrongfully detained abroad."

     American Trevor Reed released from Russia in prisoner swap
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington (CNN) American Trevor Reed , a US citizen and former Marine who had been detained in Russia since 2019, has been released in a prisoner swap.
Reed's release will not impact the US approach to the war in Ukraine, senior administration officials said.
Reed's release is part of a prisoner swap for Russian citizen Konstantin Yaroshenko, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on her official Telegram channel.
Paula Reed told Keilar that the family was "very grateful" for Biden's efforts and that they spoke to him and Trevor by phone after he was released.
In his statement welcoming Reed's release, Biden said his administration "won't stop" until Whelan is home.

     Former Marine Trevor Reed freed in prisoner swap with U.S., Russia says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadPresident Biden announced Wednesday that Russia freed former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed, in what Moscow said was a swap for Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, who was imprisoned in the United States on drug smuggling charges.
ArrowRight “Today, we welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the family that missed him dearly,” Biden said in a statement.
The swap was the “result of a lengthy negotiation process,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Telegram.
The surprise prisoner swap came at an especially tense moment in U.S.-Russian relations, even within the context of the Kremlin’s two-month-old war in Ukraine.
U.S. officials have repeatedly accused Russia of holding Americans like Reed as potential leverage in a swap.
