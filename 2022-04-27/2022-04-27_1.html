     Biden, Obama, Clintons speak at funeral for Madeleine Albright, 1st female secretary of state
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Much of official Washington paid tribute to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the first woman to ever serve in that role, at her funeral Wednesday at the National Cathedral.
She served as secretary of state from 1997 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton and as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. from 1993 to 1997.
With the NATO alliance critical in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden highlighted her work to keep NATO "strong and galvanized" when she was the nation's top diplomat.
'Putin is small and pale,' I wrote, 'so cold as to be almost reptilian,'" Albright wrote in the Times.
Both former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also spoke at the funeral, as did Albright's daughters, Anne, Alice and Katie.

     'A force for good’: Biden eulogizes Albright, first female secretary of state
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Her name is still synonymous with America as a force for good in the world.
In addition to Biden, former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton delivered eulogies in memory of Albright’s life, including her distinction as the nation’s first female secretary of state.
The music at Wednesday’s service included pieces by Czech composers in a nod to Albright’s roots: Albright was born in 1937 in what was then Czechoslovakia.
Rice and fellow former secretary of state John F. Kerry were seated next to each other, engaged in an animated discussion, before Blinken arrived to greet them.
In a floor speech Tuesday, Pelosi remembered Albright as a champion of national security and a spirited friend.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "In the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Korbel Albright," said President Joe Biden, eulogizing Albright at her funeral at Washington National Cathedral.
More than 1,400 people, each wearing face masks at the request of the Albright family, packed the cathedral.
They heard from Biden, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton describe how Albright urged other women to "interrupt" and who, despite her small stature, wasn't afraid to stand up to America's biggest adversaries.
He added: "That question is kind of up in the air, but not because of Madeleine Albright.
The ceremony's final tributes came from Albright's three daughters: Anne Albright, Alice Albright and Katherine Albright.
