     Soccer-Liverpool breeze past Villarreal to close in on Champions League final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) – An own goal and a Sadio Mane strike earned Liverpool a 2-0 victory in their Champions League semi-final first-leg against Villarreal on Wednesday, putting Juergen Klopp’s side on course for their third European Cup final in five seasons.
Villarreal defended in numbers in the first half to frustrate the six-times European Cup winners, with Thiago Alcantara going closest to breaking the deadlock with a thunderous strike from distance that hit the post.
Able to express themselves with the deadlock broken, Mohamed Salah threaded a sublime pass through for Mane to put the game beyond the visitors 133 seconds later.
Liverpool had chances to make the result more comprehensive, but will be firm favourites to finish the job in next week’s second leg in Spain.

     Liverpool take first leg of Champions League semi-final against Villarreal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool defeated Villarreal 2-0 at Anfield on Wednesday, earning a vital first-leg victory in the clubs' 2021-22 UEFA Champions League semi-final tie.
The Reds were up against a Villarreal side that had slayed European giants Juventus and Bayern Munich in the rounds leading up to their two-legged affair, and so Liverpool were wary of becoming another big-name victim of the Yellow Submarine.
While there is still a second leg to be played, Jurgen Klopp's men will feel they've put themselves in a strong position to advance to the UCL final.
A rather uneventful first half was followed by a decisive final 45 minutes for Liverpool on Wednesday.
Liverpool doubled their advantage two minutes later through Sadio Mané, who received a brilliant through ball from Mohamed Salah and poked the ball past Rulli at the top of the six-yard box.

     Liverpool nears Champions League final after outlasting Villarreal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The idea of a first XI is perhaps a little old-fashioned, but a pattern is emerging in Jürgen Klopp’s selections.
Liverpool needed all of that variety to break down a typically stubborn Villarreal.
Whereas Bayern delivered cross after cross into the box, Liverpool had far greater invention.
Not for the first time in recent years, the physical difference between the Premier League and La Liga was clear.
It’s not just that the lead is two goals, it’s that it’s extremely difficult to see how Villarreal could get three against this Liverpool without conceding.

By the end of the game, Liverpool had registered 20 attempts on goal compared to Villarreal's one.
According to official UEFA statistics, Liverpool had 93 attacks (Villarreal managed just 15) and completed 645 passes as opposed to 182 by Emery's team.
Liverpool are one game away from booking their spot in the Champions League final.
"[Liverpool] are going to suffer more than tonight in Villarreal," Emery said after this game.

The Reds remain on course for an unprecedented quadruple of Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup.
The six-time European champions started the second half at a higher tempo and quickly began to punch holes in Villarreal's rearguard.
The last thing the visitors could afford was the floodgates opening, but they were powerless to stop the waves of Liverpool attacks.
Luis Diaz smashed across the face of goal as Liverpool threatened to kill the tie off with a third.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Four-midable: Liverpool remain on course for a quadruple of trophies (AFP/LLUIS GENE) (LLUIS GENE)Jurgen Klopp warned that Liverpool must remain "on alert" despite putting one foot in the Champions League final with a dominant 2-0 win over Villarreal in the first leg of their semi-final tie at Anfield on Wednesday.
Two goals in two minutes undid Villarreal boss Unai Emery's defensive game plan as Pervis Estupinan deflected Jordan Henderson's cross into his own net before Sadio Mane slotted in a second.
The Reds remain on course for an unprecedented quadruple of Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup.
And barring a huge upset when the sides meet again in southern Spain in six days' time, Liverpool's season will finish with a third Champions League final in five seasons in Paris on May 28.
"It is 2-0 at half-time," said Liverpool boss Klopp.
