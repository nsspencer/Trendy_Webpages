     Nuggets Starting Lineup For Game 5 Against Warriors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Nuggets have announced their starting lineup for Game 5 against the Golden State Warriors.
The Denver Nuggets are in San Francisco to take on the Golden State Warriors for Game 5 of their first-round playoff series on Wednesday evening.
They are currently in a 3-1 hole, so every game the rest of the way is an elimination game.
For Game 5, they have announced their starting lineup as relayed by Underdog NBA.
Unfortunately, the Nuggets are not at full strength as two of their three best players have not played a single game in the series.

     Warriors observations: Steph Curry eliminates Nuggets with clutch Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That was the case Wednesday night with the Warriors outlasting the Denver Nuggets 102-98 in Game 5 of their first-round playoff series to advance to the Western Conference semifinals.
Steve Kerr brought Steph Curry back to the starting lineup, and the Warriors went small right away, also starting Jordan Poole, Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green.
Steph The StarterThe four-game experiment of Curry taking a seat and being the scariest Sixth Man the game has ever seen came to an end Wednesday night in Game 5.
One stat to remember: The Nuggets had 14 offensive rebounds and the Warriors had six.
But in the fourth quarter, the Warriors had two and the Nuggets didn't grab a single one.

     Summary: The Warriors wrapped up their first round series against the Nuggets on Wednesday night, advancing to the Western Conference semifinals with a 102-98 win.
If the Timberwolves win and force Game 7, then the Warriors won’t start their second round series until Tuesday.
Now that the Warriors have advanced, the Grizzlies may be the team they’d least like to see.
Memphis went 3-1 against Golden State this year, including handing the Warriors their first loss of the season at the Chase Center in late October.

     Warriors React to Massive Contribution from Gary Payton II in Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With 15 points in 26 minutes of play, Payton II proved to be a key component to Golden State’s 102-98 Game 5 win that clinched its first round series over the Nuggets.
Starting with his smothering style of defense, Payton II was able to record 2 steals against a Nuggets team that committed 14 turnovers in the game.
Considering the series against Denver was his first-ever experience playing in the NBA Playoffs, Payton II appeared to be a veteran on the floor.
Knocking down a 3-pointer in the corner, he gave Golden State an 86-84 lead with 6:57 to play.
Undoubtedly, though, Game 5 showed just what Gary Payton II could produce for a Golden State franchise on the hunt for another championship this season.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO (KRON) — The Golden State Warriors punched their ticket to the second round of the NBA Playoffs Wednesday night with a 102-98 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
Stephen Curry and Gary Payton II made clutch shots down the stretch to seal the win for Golden State.
Denver led 78-70 after the third quarter, but Golden State opened the fourth strong and took the lead on a Payton 3-pointer.
Denver’s MVP candidate Nikola Jokic gave the Warriors problems all night, finishing with 30 points, 19 rebounds and eight assists.
In the Western Conference semifinals, the Warriors will play the winner of the Minnesota Timberwolves’ series against the Memphis Grizzlies.

     Summary: (0:16)SAN FRANCISCO -- Stephen Curry dribbled through nearly the entire Denver Nuggets team before making the perfect teardrop layup to put the Golden State Warriors up with 30 seconds left in the game.
But for the first 30 minutes of Game 5 against the Nuggets, the Warriors looked lifeless.
At the 6:20 mark of the third quarter, Green hit a 26-foot 3-pointer to bring the Warriors within six of Denver.
Thompson added 15 points, while Green had 11 points, six assists, three blocks and a steal.
The Warriors let Denver stick around more than they wanted to in Game 5, but ultimately, they achieved their goal.

     These Awesome New Warriors Are Catharsis for the Whole NBA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The third-seeded Golden State Warriors look to send off the injury-ravaged Denver Nuggets in five games later Wednesday night, and it brings me no small amount of pleasure to report that the Warriors look like the Warriors again—specifically this era’s first, cool Warriors.
When those Warriors won their 73rd game, Jayson Tatum was about to graduate from high school, and Ja Morant hadn’t yet turned 17.
AdvertisementAdvertisementThis Warriors team obviously isn’t identical to the 2015 and 2016 gangs.
The mid-2010s Warriors teams became famous for their “Death Lineup,” a devastating small-ball fivesome featuring Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Barnes, Iguodala, and Draymond Green at center.
(This came to bear in 2019, Durant’s last year with the team, when a Warriors team missing KD and Klay Thompson lost the championship in six games to the Toronto Raptors.)

     Summary: After coming off the bench for the first four games of the Warriors' first-round NBA playoff series, Steph Curry appears will return to the starting lineup in Game 5 against the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night at Chase Center.
Multiple sources: All signs point to Warriors opening Game 5 vs DEN with the small lineup.
Stephen Curry moves in, Kevon Looney moves out and Draymond Green moves to center.
The Athletic's Shams Charania first reported earlier Wednesday that there was "momentum" towards Curry returning to the starting lineup.
The lineup change signifies Kerr is going for a knockout blow early in Game 5 by swapping Curry for Looney in the starting unit.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors are moving on to the Western Conference semifinals after beating Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets 102-98 in Game 5 to clinch their first-round series.
Before Cousins arrived in January, the Nuggets were outscored by 217 points in the 823 minutes they'd played without Jokic.
He was at his best in Game 5, scoring 19 points on 8-of-12 shooting to keep Denver afloat in the minutes Jokic had to rest.
For the series as a whole, the Nuggets actually won the minutes Cousins played by three.
You could argue that Anderson Varejao's excessive minutes in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals cost Golden State a championship.
