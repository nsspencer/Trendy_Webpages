    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Denver Nuggets have announced their starting lineup for Game 5 against the Golden State Warriors.
The Denver Nuggets are in San Francisco to take on the Golden State Warriors for Game 5 of their first-round playoff series on Wednesday evening.
They are currently in a 3-1 hole, so every game the rest of the way is an elimination game.
For Game 5, they have announced their starting lineup as relayed by Underdog NBA.
Unfortunately, the Nuggets are not at full strength as two of their three best players have not played a single game in the series.

     Warriors React to Massive Contribution from Gary Payton II in Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With 15 points in 26 minutes of play, Payton II proved to be a key component to Golden State’s 102-98 Game 5 win that clinched its first round series over the Nuggets.
Starting with his smothering style of defense, Payton II was able to record 2 steals against a Nuggets team that committed 14 turnovers in the game.
Considering the series against Denver was his first-ever experience playing in the NBA Playoffs, Payton II appeared to be a veteran on the floor.
Knocking down a 3-pointer in the corner, he gave Golden State an 86-84 lead with 6:57 to play.
Undoubtedly, though, Game 5 showed just what Gary Payton II could produce for a Golden State franchise on the hunt for another championship this season.
