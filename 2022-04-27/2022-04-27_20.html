     NFL Draft 2022: Now it’s proving time for Jets’ Joe Douglas, as he tries to fix this long-suffering franchise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BUY 2022 NFL DRAFT GEAR: FANATICS, NFLSHOP.COMIf not, Douglas could be gone from Florham Park sooner rather than later, with his contract expiring after the 2024 season.
After the comical failures of Douglas’ predecessors — Mike Maccagnan and John Idzik — Jets fans are ready for a change.
And movement toward that change — actually winning games — could come here in Las Vegas on Thursday night, when Douglas is scheduled to pick fourth and 10th in the 2022 NFL Draft.
Which Douglas the drafter will Jets fans get Thursday night?
So it is no understatement to say that Douglas’ Jets legacy is largely riding on what he does this weekend.

     Summary: As things currently stand, there are eight teams with multiple picks and assuming we don't see a trade, that would also set an NFL record.
Going into this year's draft, the most number of teams in one draft to have multiple picks was six, which has happened four times.
In 1973, 1974, 1989 and 2020, there were six teams with more than one first-round pick.
