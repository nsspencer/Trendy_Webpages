     ‘The Survivor’ Review: Clenched Fists
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “The Survivor,” adapted by Justine Juel Gillmer from a book by Haft’s son Alan Scott Haft, proceeds through interlocked flashbacks from 1963.
A toughened-up but spry and credibly accented Ben Foster plays Harry.
Vicky Krieps plays a potential romantic interest who helps him search for the woman he loved in Poland.
But while Levinson is not working from his own history as in “Diner” or “Avalon,” “The Survivor,” partly because of its subject matter and postwar milieu, feels of a piece with those overtly personal films.

     Roush Review: A Wrenching Holocaust ‘Survivor’ Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That in a terse nutshell is the wrenching real-life story of Harry (born Hertzko) Haft, the tormented hero of HBO‘s powerful film The Survivor, airing in honor of this week’s Holocaust Remembrance Day (Yom HaShoah).
Harry is introduced with fanfare as “the pride of Poland and the survivor of Auschwitz” as he enters a boxing ring in post-World War II Coney Island.
The Survivor is more about one man wrestling with the demons of grief and survivor guilt.
The remarkable Ben Foster undergoes an extreme physical transformation from the taut, emaciated prisoner to the beefier Americanized refugee, wary and coiled against any of life’s challenges.
But as Harry’s brother (Saro Emirze) argues, “Why did you survive if not to live?”The Survivor, Movie Premiere, Wednesday, April 27, 8/7c, HBO

     'The Survivor' review: Ben Foster stars in the remarkable Holocaust story of Harry Haft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —The underlying story is better than the movie in “The Survivor,” but that material is so harrowing as to win on what amounts to a split decision.
Timed to Holocaust Remembrance Day, the film isn’t equal to the awards bait HBO has traditionally offered in the TV-movie genre, but it should inspire plenty of googling about the remarkable tale of Harry Haft.
The major miscalculation involves the casting of Ben Foster, who is very good as Haft, but roughly twice as old as he was during World War II.
When not flashing back, much of the focus is on Haft’s boxing career, with John Leguizamo as his trainer, Danny DeVito as another fight pro and Peter Sarsgaard as a sportswriter who takes an interest in his story.
And if that doesn’t translate into a great movie, like Haft’s slugfest with Marciano, it makes a strong enough showing to more than earn your respect.

     Behind boxing film ‘The Survivor,’ a personal history of post-Holocaust trauma
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Oscar-winning director Barry Levinson agreed to make “The Survivor,” he recounted a story about his Holocaust survivor great uncle to show his interest in directing the HBO film about Auschwitz-survivor-turned-professional-boxer Harry Haft that premiered in Israel Tuesday night.
The film features Ben Foster as Harry Haft, along with Vicky Krieps, Billy Magnussen, Peter Sarsgaard, Saro Emirze, Dar Zuzovsky, Danny DeVito and John Leguizamo.
AdvertisementThe film is Leshem and Greenberg’s first project, after partnering about five years ago.
They’re pleased that HBO bought the film after its Toronto Film Festival premiere last fall, and that the platform is airing the film on Wednesday, the eve of Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Day.
They’re hoping the HBO placement will draw boxing fans to watch the film, as well as younger American viewers who may have skimpy knowledge of the Holocaust, said Greenberg.

     Summary: Gus and Ali, a real-life couple and fans of Survivor, will be individually ranking the Survivor 42 castaways into two categories, Hot or Not, based on who they think has potential longevity in the game.
Honestly, it seems to me that that alliance would form the perfect Survivor player—challenge prowess in Jonathan, social mastery in Mike, and tactical mayhem from Hai.
Not only is he part of the big group, but the outsiders think he’s not, so he’s swimming in intel and trust.
Or if she’ll just buy the whole game of Survivor with all of her advantages?
I think she’s pretty dead in the water at this point.

     HBO’s ‘The Survivor’ Asks Profound Question
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That is the question that animates Jewish director Barry Levinson’s new movie “The Survivor,” which came out on Yom HaShoah on HBO Max.
The film depicts the true story of Auschwitz survivor Harry Haft, who became a boxer in the United States and lived to 82, dying in 2007.
But the director also shows that, externally, Haft is driven to find his reason in the form of Leah.
“If not to live?”But it’s Miriam Wofsoniker, played by Vicky Krieps, who answers Perez’s question by becoming Harry’s new love interest.
Now, as Harry embraces her, she comes to represent vibrant and burgeoning love in the same way that Leah once did.
