     Maple Leafs acquire Ryan O'Reilly, Noel Acciari from Blues in three-team trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Toronto Maple Leafs have acquired Ryan O'Reilly and Noel Acciari from the St. Louis Blues in a three-team trade that also includes the Minnesota Wild.
In exchange for O'Reilly and Acciari, the Blues received forwards Mikhail Abramov and Adam Gaudette, a 2023 first-round pick, a 2023 third-round pick and a 2024 second-round pick.
With the Maple Leafs up against the salary cap, the Blues retained 50% of O'Reilly's $7.5 million cap hit, and the Wild retained 50% of the remaining $3,750,000 before sending him to the Maple Leafs.
With O'Reilly in the mix, the Maple Leafs have an embarrassment of riches at the center position.
Acciari will give the Maple Leafs a little more forward depth, and he has 10 goals and eight assists in 54 games played this season.

     ‘A bit of shock’: Why the Blues traded Ryan O’Reilly now — and what comes next
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Late Friday night, St. Louis traded O’Reilly and Noel Acciari to Toronto in a deal that needed a third team, Minnesota, to help accommodate the salary-cap ramifications.
TRADE ALERT: We've traded Ryan O'Reilly and Noel Acciari to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for a first, second and third-round draft pick, Mikhail Abramov and Adam Gaudette.
Was O’Reilly ever offered a contract to stay in St. Louis?
He did not have a no-trade clause in his contract, which he signed with Buffalo prior to his 2018 arrival in St. Louis.
They’ve now traded O’Reilly and Tarasenko in the span of a week, along with Acciari in the Toronto deal and defenseman Niko Mikkola in the package with Tarasenko.
