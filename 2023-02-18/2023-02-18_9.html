     Summary: WATCH NEWCASTLE vs LIVERPOOL FULL MATCH REPLAY STREAM – LINKBut Newcastle kept scrapping and its 10 men had more shots and a better xG than the visitors, who will simply point to the scoreboard.
Liverpool climbs into eighth with 35 points, while Newcastle’s 41 points are still good for fourth place and their two losses are a Premier League low.
Liverpool already led 2-0 at that point but somehow still opened the door to Newcastle on numerous occasions.

     Summary: For the time being however, the Blues are restored back to home turf for their next two fixtures: Aston Villa next weekend and today, Leeds United.
Marsch lost his first two outings, but then picked up eleven points from the next five to seemingly pull Leeds clear of the drop zone.
Under the caretaker, Leeds have bizarrely faced Manchester United in consecutive league games.
Style of PlayUnder Marsch, Leeds played attacking football from a 4-2-3-1 formation, though without the unique touch of Bielsa, epitomised by his patented man-to-man marking system.
