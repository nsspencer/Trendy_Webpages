     Summary: Its most popular and famous race — the Daytona 500 — comes at the beginning of its season rather than its conclusion.
Last year’s Daytona 500 averaged 8.88 million across all Fox platforms, which was up from the all-time low in 2021 (4.9 million) as well as 2020 (7.3 million).
But the numbers still lag from as little as six years ago (11.9 million viewers in 2017).
This year’s Daytona 500 — the 20th time Fox has aired the race — will air on Fox and Fox Deportes on Sunday at 2:30 p.m.
The booth includes play-by-play announcer Mike Joy, covering his 44th Daytona 500 for live TV or radio, and analysts Clint Bowyer and Tony Stewart.

     Sunday Daytona 500: Start time, TV info, weather
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Petty GMS Racing was renamed Legacy Motor Club for the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series season, and “The King” has no ownership stake in the organization that includes the No.
Petty Enterprises was founded by Richard’s father, Lee, and it morphed into Richard Petty Motorsports (in 2009) and then Petty GMS in a merger with GMS Racing last year.
But Petty said the team structure has been “kind of confusing from my standpoint” since Petty GMS was restructured into Legacy Motor Club.
After locking in a spot via qualifying Wednesday, his start in Sunday’s Daytona 500 will be Johnson’s first NASCAR race since the 2020 Cup season finale in Phoenix.
“That was one of the operations that when Jimmie come in, it was going to be hard to be ‘Petty Johnson GMS,’ ” Petty said.

     Summary: DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — “New leader … 84.”Jimmie Johnson sent a jolt through the track when he shot to the top of the leaderboard in practice for the Daytona 500.
48, the only number he’s ever used at NASCAR’s top level; that now belongs to Daytona 500 pole-sitter Alex Bowman, Johnson’s successor at Hendrick Motorsports.
Gragson is soaking in every bit of wisdom Johnson has to offer, and the deal came with spotter Earl Barban, who debuted with Johnson in that 2006 Daytona 500 victory.
AdvertisementAlthough Petty won the Daytona 500 seven times, the last Petty-owned car to win the Daytona 500 was in 1979.
But when asked this week whether he’d trade a Daytona 500 trophy for just one title, Hamlin snapped: “No.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — Three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin and his six fellow Toyota drivers skipped the final practice for "The Great American Race."
Even action sports star Travis Pastrana, who has little experience at Daytona International Speedway, sat out the 50-minute session Saturday.
He is driving a third car for 23XI Racing, the team co-owned by Hamlin and NBA legend Michael Jordan.
Sixteen of 40 cars did get in a final practice, but not pole-sitter Alex Bowman or his fellow Hendrick Motorsports teammates Kyle Larson, Chase Elliott and William Byron.
He's already noticed one issue: Some of the field has been hesitant to work with drivers who have yellow stripes designating Daytona 500 rookies on their rear bumpers.
