Woods, who hosts the event that benefits his foundation, carded a 3-over 74 in the second round Friday.
Woods is scheduled to tee off at 1:12 p.m.After shooting even-par 36 on his first nine holes, Woods had bogeys on three of his last four in the second round.
"If I chipped it up on top, there's a chance that it could actually come back to the front part of the green," Woods said.
For the second straight round, Woods struggled with his accuracy off the tees and hit only five of 14 fairways.

     Tiger Woods makes the cut at Genesis Invitational
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UK: 18+ USA: 21+ | Begambleaware.org | T&amp;Cs apply | Play ResponsiblyAfter two rounds of golf at the Genesis Invitational in Southern California, Tiger Woods has just about made it through to the weekend after a disappointing second round.
Three bogies across 15,16, 17, and 18 left him sweating on his place for the weekend but the cut stayed at +1.
Woods in the spotlightDisappointingly, the focus hasn’t solely been on Woods’ game this week after he was involved in a controversial moment with Justin Thomas and a tampon.
I blocked a lot of putts early, and this is probably the highest score I could have shot today.
I probably should have shot probably five or six better than this, easily.
