     Summary: Mark Ogden and Steve Nicol wonder if Chelsea's star players respect Graham Potter after their loss vs. Southampton.
(1:44)Chelsea suffered a narrow 1-0 defeat to bottom-of-the-table Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday, piling more pressure on manager Graham Potter.
Chelsea looked livelier in the second half when Raheem Sterling and Kai Havertz came on and they kept the Southampton defence under pressure.
Southampton goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu was kept busy and in the dying seconds of added time produced a fingertip save from substitute Conor Gallagher.
Chelsea are languishing in 10th place on 31 points from 23 games and are 10 points adrift of the top four.
