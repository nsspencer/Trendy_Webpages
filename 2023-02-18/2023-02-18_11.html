     Summary: Shots weren’t falling on offense and Illinois didn’t have to work through much to get to the rim or get good looks from the arc.
Illinois’ 42.9% mark from the field was aided by 10 offensive rebounds for 11 second chance points.
It took just over two minutes for Indiana to find some offense as Illinois gladly extended its lead in turn.
Key performances down the stretch from Jalen Hood-Schifino, Trayce Jackson-Davis and Miller Kopp helped Indiana claw back into the game and eventually reclaim the lead.
Mayer, defended primarily by Kopp, made just one of his seven attempts from the field in the second half.

     Summary: Indiana men’s basketball needs Miller Kopp, and Miller Kopp needs Indiana men’s basketball.
The graduate student forward entered Saturday’s game against Illinois on the back of a 1-for-6 shooting night Wednesday at Northwestern.
Kopp and Jackson-Davis have developed a connection when the latter gets trapped, Kopp said.
Indiana was down 7 points at the time, was 2-for-6 from deep and hadn’t attempted a 3-pointer three minutes into the second half.
But he made every right play.”Kopp’s night came just days after, perhaps, his worst shooting performance of the year.
