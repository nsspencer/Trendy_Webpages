     Olivia Newton-John Has A Posthumous "Jolene" Duet With Dolly Parton: Watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Olivia Newton-John and Dolly Parton had a great friendship while the Grease actor and singer was still alive — ever since Newton-John won the Country Music Association Female Vocalist Of The Year award in 1974 for “If You Love Me (Let Me Know),” making her the first non-American-born artist to win that award.
Before Newton-John passed away in August 2022, she actually recorded a duets album, Just the Two of Us: The Duets Collection, which will be out in May.
One of the duets features Parton; it’s the two singers performing Parton’s 1974 classic “Jolene.” The reimagined “Jolene” also features a new video of the two singers; Newton-John also says how she “always wanted to sing with Dolly.”“I’m so excited to be working with Olivia Newton-John, one of my favorites of all time,” Parton says in another clip.
Watch Parton and Newton-John sing “Jolene” below.
Just the Two of Us: The Duets Collection will be out 5/5 via Primary Wave Music.

     Olivia Newton-John Sings With Dolly Parton in Her Final Video
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The album includes a duet version of "Jolene" with Dolly Parton, and the two artists also starred in a music video, which would turn out to be Newton-John's last.
Newton-John hailed Parton as a supportive person in her early career in Nashville, and she even recorded version of "Jolene" in 1976 to show her respect.
Newton-John also shares a message at the top of the video, saying she has "always wanted" to sing with Parton.
Parton takes on the second verse solo and the two then sing the chorus together, with Parton repeating each "Jolene" as Newton-John sings them.
Newton-John continuously sings "Jolene" while hitting high notes in her voice and Parton sings words from the verses.
