     Trump: I won’t call DeSantis ‘Meatball Ron’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Donald Trump on Saturday said he wouldn’t use the nickname “Meatball Ron” to describe Ron DeSantis, a likely rival for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.
In a Truth Social post, the former president said it would be “inappropriate” to use the word “‘meatball’ as a moniker, which has been described as referring to DeSantis’ appearance and carries connotations to his Italian lineage.
Trump has used the term in casual conversations while also labeling the Florida governor “Shutdown Ron,” a reference to restrictions the governor put in place at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the New York Times reported.

     Summary: Donald Trump is denying coining a particularly offensive nickname for Florida’s Governor.
Overnight on Truth Social, the former President forcefully repudiated the “Meatball Ron” nickname for Ron DeSantis as “totally inappropriate,” in a post that nonetheless found other ways to insult his one-time political ally and endorsed candidate.
“I will never call Ron DeSanctimonious “Meatball” Ron, as the Fake News is insisting I will.
In a post on his Truth Social account Monday, the former President tried to knock down a New York Times story that accused him of calling the Florida Governor “Meatball Ron” and “Shutdown Ron” in private.
I don’t spend my time trying to smear other Republicans,” the Governor told a crowd in Ocala earlier this month.

     Summary: Ron DeSantis (R) “Meatball Ron” following reports that he used the insulting nickname privately.
“Meatball Ron,” as The New York Times reported Trump has described the governor in casual conversations, is apparently a dig at DeSantis’ appearance and Italian heritage.
Trump has also used “Shutdown Ron” to describe DeSantis, referring to his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Times.
“His beaches and State were closed for long periods of time, his testing, testing, testing for the China Virus didn’t work out too well, and his loyalty skills are really weak,” Trump said in his Saturday post.
Trump announced his campaign for a second term in November, and has usually referred to DeSantis as “Ron DeSanctimonious.” Trump famously uses derogatory nicknames for his political opponents.

     Summary: “I will never call Ron DeSanctimonious ‘Meatball’ Ron, as the Fake News is insisting I will,” Trump said at 1 a.m. on his social media platform Truth Social.
Ron DeSantis has so far refused to take the bait APIt was the second time this week Trump knocked back the Times report, but his previous post did not repeat the moniker some observers say is a slur against Italians.
The post suggests Trump is ramping up his shadow campaign with DeSantis for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.
DeSantis is widely expected to jump into the race and has become a favorite of those looking for an alternative to Trump.
Though Trump has now taken repeated shots at the Florida governor — a former protégé — DeSantis has assiduously refused to take the bait.

During a Saturday interview on the Fox News Channel‘s Cavuto Live, Karl Rove castigated Donald Trump for “childish attacks” against the Florida Governor, a likely opponent in the 2024 Republican Presidential Primaries.
Trump knocked down reports that he maligned DeSantis as “Meatball Ron” overnight on his Truth Social account.
That was his second disavowal of so-called “fake news” suggesting that he was looking to improve on the “Ron DeSanctimonious” moniker he coined for DeSantis at a rally last year.
The real Ron is a RINO GLOBALIST, who closed quickly down Florida and even its beaches.

She uses the word “autocrat” five times and “authoritarian” four times in this particular damning of DeSantis.

     Summary: Former President Donald Trump said he will not call Ron DeSantis by the nickname 'Meatball Ron,' but then repeated a different slur for his potential GOP challenger.
'I will never call Ron DeSanctimonious 'Meatball' Ron, as the Fake News is insisting I will,' he wrote on conservative social media site.
Former President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post Saturday that will not call Florida Gov.
He's knocked him as 'Ron DeSanctimonious' on multiple occasions in recent weeks, a nickname Trump debuted just before the midterm election races which earned him criticism from fellow Republicans for shooting inside the tent.
'Ron DeSantis was having a 'drink' party with his students when he was a high school teacher.
