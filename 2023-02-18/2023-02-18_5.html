     Newcastle vs Liverpool LIVE: Premier League latest score and goal updates as hosts down to 10-men following Nick Pope red card
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ✕ Close Jurgen Klopp Liverpool Pre-Match Newcastle EPLNewcastle host Liverpool in a crucial Premier League meeting that could determine which of the two teams finishes the season inside the top four.
Eddie Howe’s side have been in the Champions League spots for most of the season and the 2-1 defeat they suffered at Anfield in August remains their only loss of the Premier League campaign so far but they have taken a stumble following three consecutive draws, which has given some hope to the chasing pack.
In contrast, Liverpool will look to back up their 2-0 win over Everton in the Merseyside derby on Monday.
Jurgen Klopp’s side, who have a game in hand over Newcastle, would close the gap on the Magpies to three points should they win that spare match and earn a victory today but a defeat would surely rule out any chance of a top four finish.
Follow the action as Newcastle take on Liverpool at St. James’ Park:

     Newcastle United vs. Liverpool live score updates: Visitors in charge after Nunez and Gakpo goals, Pope red card
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: February 18, 2023 at 12:49 PM EST16' Newcastle 0-1 LiverpoolWhat a gorgeous and perfectly timed pass that was from Trent Alexander-Arnold for Darwin Nunez.
It is of course something we have come to expect from the right-back who picks up his first assist in the Premier League this season after his assist for Cody Gakpo against Everton on Monday was judged to have taken a deflection on its way through.
And a word for Nunez who did so well to control the ball first-time and pull his right arm back to ensure he didn't touch it.
That was a confident and accurate finish, the kind he hasn't always been able to pull off so far this season.
