     The Tiger Woods Tampon ‘Prank’ Isn't Just Offensive—It's Stupid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It may be 2023, but Tiger Woods' sense of humor is stuck in 2005.
Look, I don't know much about golf, but I know what misogyny looks like, and Woods hit a hole-in-one there during the Genesis Invitational at California's Riviera Country Club.
On February 16, Golfweek reported that Woods slipped a tampon into fellow player Justin Thomas' hand after outdriving him on the ninth hole.
“Did Tiger Woods go to the store…and buy a box of Tampons?” reporter Alison Hall asked on Twitter.
So little laughter.”Personally, I wonder if Tiger Woods knows we're dealing with a national tampon shortage.

     Tiger Woods responds to backlash of handing Justin Thomas a tampon: 'Friends having fun'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After Justin Thomas failed to outdrive the 47-year-old Woods, the 15-time major champion handed him a tampon.
Tiger Woods of the United States (L) and Justin Thomas of the United States walk off the ninth tee during the first round of the The Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club on February 16, 2023 in Pacific Palisades, California.
Thomas laughed at what Woods called a "prank," but Woods noted that many haven't taken it lightly.
"It was supposed to be a funny game, but obviously it hasn't turned out that way," Woods said.
The Genesis Invitational is Woods' first tournament since The Open Championship last July.
