    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Initially founded in 2001, the XFL was a joint collaboration between NBC and WWF (WWE), spearheaded by Vince McMahon.
After a hot start, poor ratings ultimately led to the league lasting just one season.
For cost-saving measures, each XFL team will train in Arlington, Texas, and will only travel for game days.
The league is scheduled for 10 weeks before a two-round playoff starting later this spring on Saturday, May 13.
Eagles fans tuning into the XFL season will see 17 players with ties to the midnight green.
