     The Tiger Woods Tampon ‘Prank’ Isn't Just Offensive—It's Stupid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It may be 2023, but Tiger Woods' sense of humor is stuck in 2005.
Look, I don't know much about golf, but I know what misogyny looks like, and Woods hit a hole-in-one there during the Genesis Invitational at California's Riviera Country Club.
On February 16, Golfweek reported that Woods slipped a tampon into fellow player Justin Thomas' hand after outdriving him on the ninth hole.
“Did Tiger Woods go to the store…and buy a box of Tampons?” reporter Alison Hall asked on Twitter.
So little laughter.”Personally, I wonder if Tiger Woods knows we're dealing with a national tampon shortage.

     Tiger Woods Ripped By Women's Empowerment Group As Misogynistic For Tampon Prank
    </h2>

     Summary: Tiger Woods is being called out by a women's empowerment group for his tampon prank at a PGA Tour event ... saying how dare he, especially with a daughter at home.
Kara Sugar, CEO of the Women's Global Empowerment Fund, tells TMZ ... Tiger's tampon moment was not only misogynistic but also tone-deaf and straight-up disrespectful to women and girls all over the world.
Sugar ripped the golfing legend, wondering if he's intimating "periods are embarrassing or shameful or a sign of weakness?"
The women's group says it's sad to see Tiger do this because he's a grown man with a daughter ... and they feel the joke distracts from the serious issues involving mental health and periods, which women and girls around the globe face.
