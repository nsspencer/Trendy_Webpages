     How Liverpool beat 10-man Newcastle thanks to Nunez, Gakpo goals, Pope red card
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We played really well, but then against 10 we lost for a moment the grip and couldn't get it back.
But we still had our moments where we should have scored more in the second half.
The pass from Trent (Alexander-Arnold) for Darwin (Nunez) and from Mo (Salah) to Cody (Gakpo) top class.
A bit more of that would have been really great, but for today it's absolutely fine.
We got our second win in a row.

     Summary: WATCH NEWCASTLE vs LIVERPOOL FULL MATCH REPLAY STREAM – LINKBut Newcastle kept scrapping and its 10 men had more shots and a better xG than the visitors, who will simply point to the scoreboard.
Liverpool climbs into eighth with 35 points, while Newcastle’s 41 points are still good for fourth place and their two losses are a Premier League low.
Liverpool already led 2-0 at that point but somehow still opened the door to Newcastle on numerous occasions.
