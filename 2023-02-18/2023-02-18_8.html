     Summary: 0 of 1Credit: WWE.comAfter years spent carving out his spot in WWE, Sami Zayn competed in the most significant match of his pro wrestling career Saturday night in his hometown of Montreal against undisputed WWE universal champion Roman Reigns.
The emotionally fueled contest headlined an Elimination Chamber pay-per-view that served as a key stop on The Road to WrestleMania 39.
Did Zayn do the unthinkable and knock off Reigns to cash his ticket to The Showcase of the Immortals, or did The Tribal Chief ruin the challenger's dream and ensure his historic run lived to see another day?
Find out with this recap of a show that also featured two Elimination Chamber matches and the return to the squared circle of Edge and Beth Phoenix.

     WWE Elimination Chamber 2023: Roman Reigns Winning And 5 Smart Booking Decisions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Roman Reigns and Sami Zayn have created the best storyline in WWE.
A rare Canadian PPV that will emanate from Montreal, Elimination Chamber is also going to have a raucous near-sellout crowd with big bouts involving hometown heroes like Zayn and Edge.
So, when Theory defends his US title against five other stars inside the Elimination Chamber, WWE has the perfect out.
So, here’s a novel idea: Why not use this Elimination Chamber match to help create a new star?
That’s both the easiest and best story to tell, and it’s also a great way to conclude one of the best storylines in WWE history.

With no clear favorite coming into the match, why not give the strap to a fan favorite and go from there?

     Summary: WWE's final pay-per-view stop on the Road to WrestleMania goes down on Saturday when the Elimination Chamber comes to Montreal.
Instead, Zayn struck Reigns and led to an incredible moment that seems to have the faction splitting at the seams.
Reigns vs. Zayn should have a great atmosphere and tell a good story, but it would be a legitimate shocker if Zayn left Montreal with the titles.
Asuka is certainly the most credible competitor in this Chamber match and her new gimmick needs to be protected.
If we're getting Theory vs. Cena, then the champion will certainly leave Elimination Chamber with his title in hand.
