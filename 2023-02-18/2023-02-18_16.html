     Summary: It may be 2023, but Tiger Woods' sense of humor is stuck in 2005.
Look, I don't know much about golf, but I know what misogyny looks like, and Woods hit a hole-in-one there during the Genesis Invitational at California's Riviera Country Club.
On February 16, Golfweek reported that Woods slipped a tampon into fellow player Justin Thomas' hand after outdriving him on the ninth hole.
“Did Tiger Woods go to the store…and buy a box of Tampons?” reporter Alison Hall asked on Twitter.
So little laughter.”Personally, I wonder if Tiger Woods knows we're dealing with a national tampon shortage.

     Summary: Tiger Woods is being called out by a women's empowerment group for his tampon prank at a PGA Tour event ... saying how dare he, especially with a daughter at home.
Kara Sugar, CEO of the Women's Global Empowerment Fund, tells TMZ ... Tiger's tampon moment was not only misogynistic but also tone-deaf and straight-up disrespectful to women and girls all over the world.
Sugar ripped the golfing legend, wondering if he's intimating "periods are embarrassing or shameful or a sign of weakness?"
The women's group says it's sad to see Tiger do this because he's a grown man with a daughter ... and they feel the joke distracts from the serious issues involving mental health and periods, which women and girls around the globe face.

     Tiger Woods Apologizes After Backlash for Handing Justin Thomas a Tampon During Genesis Invitational
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tiger Woods has issued an apology after he received backlash online for handing friend and fellow competitor Justin Thomas a tampon during the first round at the Genesis Open this week.
Woods, 47, outdrove Thomas, 29, in the ninth hole of the Genesis Open at Riviera Country Club, hitting 323 yards compared to Thomas' 313 yards.
As the two walked up the fairway, Woods walked by him and slid a tampon in his hand, which Thomas hastily threw down before the duo started laughing.
"Yeah, it was supposed to be all fun and games, and obviously it hasn't turned out that way," Woods said, per ESPN.
However, the second round did not go as smoothly for the golf champion, as he just made the cut into the third round with one-over-par 143.
