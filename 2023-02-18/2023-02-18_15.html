     Greg Hardy knocked out in bare knuckle fight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesGreg Hardy, the former Pro Bowl defensive end whose NFL career ended because of a domestic violence accusation, has taken up a second career as a pro fighter.
Hardy has signed with an organization called Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, which promotes boxing without gloves.
In his first fight on Friday night, he was knocked cold by Josh Watson, a mediocre fighter he was handed as his first bare knuckle opponent in an attempt to give him an easy win.
Hardy signed with the UFC in 2018 and won some fights, but he was cut by that organization a year ago after suffering three consecutive knockout losses.
The Cowboys signed him in 2015, but after that no NFL team wanted him, and so he found fighting as his second career.

I mean the sheer crack of opponent Josh Watson’s bare knuckles is akin to nails on a chalkboard.
I guess he was bored fighting with gloves, so he decided to head over to bare knuckle fighting… and well, you saw what happened.
Hardy’s opponent Josh Watson absolutely decimated Hardy.

     Summary: Former NFL player and UFC fighter Greg Hardy knocked out in Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship debut after calling out Tyson Fury and Anthony JoshuaFormer NFL star Greg Hardy has suffered another huge setback in his combat sports career.
AdvertisementIn round two, Watson landed a big right that put Hardy down for good.
In 2010, his career in elite sports started when he was a sixth-round draft pick in the NFL for the Carolina Panthers.
This did not stop punishment from the NFL, though, and he was suspended for ten games for violating the NFL personal conduct policy.
A move to boxing followed his UFC exit and Hardy managed to pick up wins over Mike Cook and Hasim Rahman Jr after calling out Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua.
