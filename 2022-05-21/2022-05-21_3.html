     Kylian Mbappé Will Stay at P.S.G., Rejecting Real Madrid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Mbappé had made no secret of his desire to move to Real Madrid from P.S.G., and the Spanish powerhouse went all out to recruit him.
His expiring contract in Paris also meant he was a free agent, available without a multimillion-dollar transfer fee.
In addition to the nine-figure signing bonus and the stunning annual salary — a huge offer even by Real Madrid’s standards — the club also was said to have offered Mbappé complete control over his image rights, a lucrative revenue stream that Real Madrid typically shares with its roster of stars.
and its Qatari owners managed to offer an even better deal in a transfer soap opera that has dragged on for more than a year, ever since Real Madrid first tried to extract Mbappé from Paris with the offer of a record transfer fee.
For P.S.G., retaining Mbappé provides a welcome highlight in a season that has been played against a backdrop of uncertainty after yet another failure in the Champions League.

     Kylian Mbappe decision: PSG superstar to stay in Paris, turns down lucrative offer from Real Madrid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arguably the top young talent in all of world soccer will stay with Paris Saint-Germain instead of joining UEFA Champions League finalists Real Madrid.
PSG announced that he was staying before the team's final Ligue 1 match of the campaign on Saturday against Metz.
In a short video, Mbappe says "This is Paris," as he stands high up at the Parc des Princes.
"I am very happy to be staying in Paris -- my city," Mbappe said to the fans.
Keeping Mbappe allows the club to continue fielding him alongside Messi and Neymar in the attack -- assuming that neither move on this summer.

Mbappé, meanwhile, stays at PSG and continues to team with Lionel Messi and Neymar in the most star-studded attacking trident on the planet.
He has also won a UEFA Nations League title with his country.
The word on Friday was that PSG and Real Madrid had made seismic offers of equal financial might, leaving it down to a personal choice.
