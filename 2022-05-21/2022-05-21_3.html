     Summary: Today GLAAD responded on Twitter to last night’s episode of ‘Real Time with Bill Maher’, during which Maher parroted inaccurate and anti-transgender talking points often used by anti-LGBTQ activists trying to roll back equality for transgender people:This is not the first time Bill Maher has spouted inaccurate, anti-trans rhetoric.
But this time he's targeting youth.
Pundits who fearmonger about trans youth and surgeries need to learn the facts.
Youth are not rushed into medical transition.

     Bill Maher Says Gender Reassignment with Kids Has Gone Too Far
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bill Maher ventures into dicey areas all the time, and he did not disappoint Friday night when he argued ... gender reassignment with kids has gone too far.
The "Real Time" host began his weekly editorial with some interesting stats ... before 1946, only .08% of the population identified as LGBTQ.
That number shot up to 2.6% among Baby Boomers.
Bill's argument is laced with humor, but at its core, he's saying especially when it comes to kids, their feelings are not always innate ... he says they often react to trends, to friends, to social media and parents should not reflexively take their children down a path of gender reassignment until the child's self-identity is certain.
He zeroes in on hormone blockers on young kids, the consequences of which he thinks have been glossed over.

     Maher says increase in those identifying as LGBT partly attributed to being ‘trendy’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HBO show host and comedian Bill Maher claimed that there was an increase in the number of individuals identifying as LGBT partly because “it’s trendy.”On his show, “Real Time with Bill Maher,” Maher discussed a Gallup poll that noted an increase in the number of Americans per generation self-identifying as LGBT.
“Yes, part of the rise in LGBT numbers is from people feeling free enough to tell it to a pollster and that’s all to the good, but some of it is — it’s trendy,” Maher said.
A Gallup poll published in February indicated a steady increase between generations of Americans who self-identify as LGBT.
About 2.6 percent of Baby Boomers — those born between 1946 and 1964 — identified as LGBT compared to 10.5 percent of millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996.)
Compare that to Generation Z — those born between 1997 and 2003 — and the percentage increases to 20.8 percent.

Maher asked Esper about Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, and whether Esper felt that there were any connections between that and the current war taking place between Russia and Ukraine.
Maher returned to one of his running themes this year — which is to say that defense budgets are too high.
Brazile felt that he would; Carolla was holding out hope for a Michelle Obama run.
Maher opened New Rules with riffs on the mile high club and iPhone covers that look like VHS tapes.

     Summary: Last night on Real Time with Bill Maher, the HBO host tackled a somewhat sensitive topic during his “New Rule” segment of the show, suggesting the rise of the LGBTQ community is due in part to the fact that it’s trendy.
“They meant what profession.”He then mentioned a recent ACLU finding that claimed the controversy about abortion rights affects LGBTQ people more than heterosexual couples.
Maher then talked about the Grand Marshalls for the upcoming Pride parade in New York, none of whom are gay men.
Thank God no one scheduled me for eye removal and peg leg surgery.”You can check out the clip from Maher’s full “New Rule” segment above.
