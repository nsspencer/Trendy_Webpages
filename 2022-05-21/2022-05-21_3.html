     Latest On Sasha Banks and Naomi's Statuses With WWE After Walk Out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WWE will reportedly not fire Women's Tag Team Champions Sasha Banks and Naomi amid their recent walkout in fear of them both signing with its top competitor, All Elite Wrestling, according to Wrestling Observer Newsletter's Dave Meltzer.
Meltzer cited a recent incident in which involving Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair during a live broadcast of SmackDown in which the two women's apparent real-life issues with each other led to an awkward, off-script exchange.
"If it was another time and place, it's very possible that they would have been fired, but it's this time and this place," Meltzer said during the latest episode of Wrestling Observer Radio.
Earlier this week, Banks' husband, Sarath 'Mikaze' Ton, fired back at reports claiming his wife and her tag-team partner, were pulled from WWE live events following their walkout during RAW on Monday (May 16).
"The b******* being spewed is next level," Ton quote-tweeted in response to a post shared by Ringside News.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I’m confused by the circumstances around the initial walkout.
I’m confused by how WWE has chosen to handle this, and I’m confused by where the women’s tag team division goes from here.
Why exactly did Sasha Banks and Naomi walk out again?
The most basic story coming from all sides is that Sasha Banks and Naomi walked out of Raw because WWE wanted Naomi to face Bianca Belair and Sasha Banks to face Ronda Rousey at Hell In A Cell.
It’s not as if Sasha Banks doesn’t have options, whether it be Hollywood or working for other companies down the line.

     WWE’s Sasha Banks and Naomi suspended indefinitely after ‘Monday Night Raw’ incident
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (NEXSTAR) – WWE superstars Sasha Banks and Naomi have been “suspended indefinitely” after they reportedly walked out ahead of a scheduled appearance on “Monday Night Raw” earlier this week.
Some took issue with the WWE’s statement, as well WWE announcer Corey Graves, who called the two unprofessional during the “Monday Night Raw” broadcast.
“Becky &amp; Charlotte can embarrass the company on national TV but Naomi &amp; Sasha gotta get a statement put out saying how they’re unprofessional and dragged on tv by Corey graves…?” one fan wrote.
Sapp also said Sasha Banks walked out — along with Naomi — before the start of Monday’s broadcast, and not during it as WWE suggested, citing information from inside sources.
In addition to WWE confirming its suspension of Sasha Banks and Naomi on Friday, fans also noticed the official WWE shop appeared to have removed merchandise associated with either wrestler.
