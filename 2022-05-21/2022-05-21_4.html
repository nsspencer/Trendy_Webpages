     What to expect from Adley Rutschman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Orioles were coming off of a 115-loss season in 2018 when they hired Mike Elias from the Houston Astros to be their general manager.
The following June, Elias was able to make his first truly big stamp on the team’s future and its rebuilding plan by having the No.
1 overall pick.
And as good as Witt was, and will be, it was a year where it was pretty clear-cut who the top pick should be.
In his three years at Oregon State, not only did Rutschman hit .353/.473/.559, win a national title as a sophomore and the Golden Spikes Award as a junior, he carried himself like a generational prospect who could help a team turn things around while effortlessly shouldering the burden of being “the man.”

    </h2>

     Summary: Rutschman also displays a plus arm and exchange behind the dish that should neutralize the running game even at the highest level.
OutlookRutschman’s combination of potentially elite hitting, elite fielding as well as elite makeup are rarely seen across the sport, and perhaps have never been seen before at the catching position.
Adley has the kind of special skill set where essentially any comp isn’t crazy.
Catchers who impact the game on both sides of the ball are just too rare nowadays.
Expect to see him with a chance to crack the Opening Day roster for the Orioles in 2022.

The beginning of every big league story also marks the end of somebody else’s, or at least an interruption of theirs.
The corresponding roster move for Rutschman’s contract being selected was that Anthony Bemboom has been designated for assignment.
Rodríguez is the best at .698, which in his park in this year is above MLB average, but still.
For today, there’s no reason not to dream that this is the start of better things for the Orioles.

The Orioles finished last in the AL East in both 2017 and 2018, and were in the process of repeating that feat when Rutschman was drafted in 2019.
It started out normal enough, with Rutschman getting into 37 games in the lower levels of the Orioles’ system in the months after the draft.
With Rutschman injured to start the year, the club selected Bemboom’s contract, pairing him with Chirinos as the club’s catching duo.

Rutschman then dominated as a junior, hitting .411/.575/.751 with 17 homers and twice as many walks as strikeouts.
That production, combined with his profile made Rutschman a generational prospect: a switch-hitting catcher with elite on-base ability and defensive skills so polished, some evaluators believed he could catch in the Majors three years ago.
Said one rival scout in 2021: “It’s as complete a package of physical tools, accompanying skill to enact those tools and makeup traits that you’re going to find, particularly at that position.” The Orioles are hoping it translates into their new face of the franchise for years to come.
