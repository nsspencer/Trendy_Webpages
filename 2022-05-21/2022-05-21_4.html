     Natasha Lyonne demonstrates a true cosmic connection to SNL in its season finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Clad in a black catsuit, Saturday Night Live host Natasha Lyonne strode onto the stage of Studio 8H like she owned the place.
Still, Lyonne made a strong impression—in at least one case, a season-best—and SNL would be well served to have her back ASAP.
It cast Lyonne as a boorish boss who is shot dead by secretary Heidi Gardner and must be propped up by her and her compatriots (Cecily Strong, Ego Nwodim) for a stockholder meeting.
It’s unusual for so many departures to be announced at once, ahead of the season finale.
In recent weeks, SNL has been giving more time to Chloe Fineman and Melissa Villaseñor, in particular, and they’ve excelled.
