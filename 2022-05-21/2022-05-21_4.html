The corresponding roster move for Rutschman’s contract being selected was that Anthony Bemboom has been designated for assignment.
Rodríguez is the best at .698, which in his park in this year is above MLB average, but still.
For today, there’s no reason not to dream that this is the start of better things for the Orioles.

     Summary: The Orioles announced that they have selected the contract of top prospect Adley Rutschman.
Due to the struggles of the big league club, Rutschman instantly became the light at the end of the tunnel for Baltimore fans.
The Orioles finished last in the AL East in both 2017 and 2018, and were in the process of repeating that feat when Rutschman was drafted in 2019.
It started out normal enough, with Rutschman getting into 37 games in the lower levels of the Orioles’ system in the months after the draft.
With Rutschman injured to start the year, the club selected Bemboom’s contract, pairing him with Chirinos as the club’s catching duo.

Rutschman then dominated as a junior, hitting .411/.575/.751 with 17 homers and twice as many walks as strikeouts.
That production, combined with his profile made Rutschman a generational prospect: a switch-hitting catcher with elite on-base ability and defensive skills so polished, some evaluators believed he could catch in the Majors three years ago.
Said one rival scout in 2021: “It’s as complete a package of physical tools, accompanying skill to enact those tools and makeup traits that you’re going to find, particularly at that position.” The Orioles are hoping it translates into their new face of the franchise for years to come.
