     Dodgers Vs. Phillies Game Preview: Bryce Harper Returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers are on a six-game winning streak and have taken the last two meetings against the Philadelphia Phillies, but face the challenge of Bryce Harper returning to the lineup.
During his last 10 games, Harper has a .450 batting average with seven doubles, five home runs, four walks and 12 RBI.
Mitch White leads the Dodgers’ effort in slowing down Harper in what’s his first start of the season.
The Phillies counter with Aaron Nola, who went seven innings and allowed just two runs in the finale of the four-game series at Dodger Stadium.
He exited with a lead but didn’t factor into the decision as the Dodgers avoided being swept behind a walk-off win.

     Dodgers vs. Phillies updates: Dodgers trail despite Mookie Betts’ ninth home run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mookie Betts hits ninth home run to tie the game, but then Phillies retake leadMookie Betts had no home runs in his first 11 games this season, and only two through 18.
But the Dodgers outfielder is now just one homer off the National League lead, after tying tonight’s game in the third inning with a solo shot to left.
Betts has been on a tear his last nine games, batting .333 with four home runs, nine extra-base hits and eight RBIs.
In the next half-inning, Alec Bohm launched a two-run shot off Mitch White, bringing the Dodger right-hander’s evening to an end.

     Dodgers vs. Phillies Odds, Picks, Predictions: Target Philly Early With Bryce Harper in the Lineup (Saturday, May 21)

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dodgers vs. Phillies OddsDodgers Odds +112 Phillies Odds -132 Over/Under 9 Time 6:05 p.m.
It’s expected the right-hander will throw around three innings before the Dodgers opt for a bullpen game.
The Dodgers bullpen ranks sixth in bullpen ERA this season and ranks inside the top 10 in home runs allowed.
Phillies’ Nola Should Find Better LuckThere should be no concern when it comes to Nola and how he’ll fare in the coming weeks.
I don’t trust the Phillies bullpen to back the under for the full game, so look toward the first half instead.

     Summary: The Los Angeles Dodgers will attempt to replicate last night’s success as they face off with the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park.
Additionally, the Dodgers have struggled against the Phillies’ hitters this season, including last weekend, when they allowed 33 runs over four games.
Los Angeles will need support from its bats.
It will be interesting to see how Los Angeles manages the game and if they can repeat what they did yesterday.
Philadelphia also will cover if they can get to the Los Angeles pitching early and establish a pattern.
