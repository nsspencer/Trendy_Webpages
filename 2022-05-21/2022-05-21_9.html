     David Benavidez overwhelms David Lemieux to snatch interim WBC super middleweight title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Benavidez drowned David Lemieux out with a diverse offering of punches en route to a third-round corner stoppage at the Gila River Arena in Glendale, Ariz. on Saturday night.
"I'm waiting for them to send me the contract," Benavidez told Showtime's Jim Gray.
Dock later told Showtime's Jim Gray that he would've stopped the fight if there were a few more seconds on the clock in that first frame.
The second round had Benavidez catching Lemieux with a right-left combination that put the veteran on his backside through the ropes and nearly out of the ring.
"Mike Tyson gave me that name — 'The Mexican Monster,'" Benavidez told Gray.

     David Benavidez Beats Down David Lemieux, Stops Him in Three
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GLENDALE, Arizona – David Benavidez vowed to leave the ring with a knockout and the title at stake.
It was mission accomplished for Phoenix’s favorite son, who tore through Montreal’s David Lemieux en route to a third-round knockout win.
David Benavidez is a hell of a fighter.”The lopsided defeat was likely his last day in the sun at this level.
Much of his career has been plagued by injury, while his super middleweight run has shown that he is truly a middleweight.
Benavidez is now the interim WBC super middleweight titlist and—more importantly—the mandatory WBC challenger to undisputed super middleweight champion Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez (57-2-2, 39KOs).
