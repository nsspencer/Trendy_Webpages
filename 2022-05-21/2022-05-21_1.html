     Pete Davidson to Exit 'Saturday Night Live' After Eight Years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pete Davidson is set to exit Saturday Night Live after the show’s 47th season later this weekend.
Davidson will be joined by Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon and Kyle Mooney.

     Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson Could Be The Latest Celebs Moving To Australia, But It’s Not What You Think
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Speculation has it that Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, could very well be the next to take the 100-degree (Fahrenheit) plunge, but hold on, it’s not what you think.
In other words, no, Kim Kardashian isn’t angling to take over another corner of the market by establishing a SKIMS Down Under line.
However, Kim Kardashian will likely make "the land of the long weekend" live up to its name, if she goes with him at all.
Pete Davidson and Franz Rogowitz will star opposite each other as the two pothead leads who accidentally stumble into thievery.
Maybe a future season of the reality series sees Kim Kardashian jet down to the land of koalas and vegemite for Pete Davidson – if they’re still together by then.
