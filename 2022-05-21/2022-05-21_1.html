     Pete Davidson to Exit 'Saturday Night Live' After Eight Years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pete Davidson is set to exit Saturday Night Live after the show’s 47th season later this weekend.
Davidson will be joined by Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon and Kyle Mooney.
Davidson joined the cast relatively unknown but has become an underrated presence throughout the years.
All four cast members have become mainstays for the program over the years and leave big shoes to fill following their exit.
Davidson’s tenure included his popular “Weekend Update,” impression of the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and actor Rami Malek.

     Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson Could Be The Latest Celebs Moving To Australia, But It’s Not What You Think
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Speculation has it that Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, could very well be the next to take the 100-degree (Fahrenheit) plunge, but hold on, it’s not what you think.
In other words, no, Kim Kardashian isn’t angling to take over another corner of the market by establishing a SKIMS Down Under line.
However, Kim Kardashian will likely make "the land of the long weekend" live up to its name, if she goes with him at all.
Pete Davidson and Franz Rogowitz will star opposite each other as the two pothead leads who accidentally stumble into thievery.
Maybe a future season of the reality series sees Kim Kardashian jet down to the land of koalas and vegemite for Pete Davidson – if they’re still together by then.

“How come that dude gets all of these, like, hot women?” the senator asked.
“Pete Davidson was dating Kate Beckinsale — I mean, you’re talking Underworld.

     How will ‘Saturday Night Live’ say farewell to Pete Davidson and Kate McKinnon?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s time to bid farewell to some of your favorite “Saturday Night Live” cast members.
Reports are circulating, including from industry insider Variety, that Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant and Kyle Mooney will be saying their goodbyes with the May 21 season finale, which features “Russian Doll’s” Natasha Lyonne as host.
The burning question, however, is whether there will be any special tributes or sketches to honor the departing cast members.
When Will Ferrell left in 2002, his castmates appeared in a sketch that began by them singing his praises.
(At the end of the sketch, Ferrell made an appearance…and he confessed to stealing the Walkman.)
