     Insider Claims Pete Davidson Is Quitting SNL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having been on the show since 2014, according to Rolling Stone, Pete Davidson quickly became one of the most popular "Saturday Night Live" cast members.
Davidson's life regularly bled into the show's Weekend Update segments, especially after he started dating Kim Kardashian (via Cosmopolitan).
I'm like, 'Weekend Update' jokes.
When I'm not there, they'll be like, 'Ha ha ha, Pete's a f***ing jerk face.'
If I'm the joke or I'm in on the joke."

     Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, others set to leave 'SNL'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cast members Aidy Bryant, Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, and Kyle Mooney are set to leave the show after tonight's 47th season finale, Variety reported yesterday based on an insider source.
McKinnon and Bryant have the longest tenure of the four, having joined in 2012.
Mooney joined in 2013, and Davidson in 2014.
Davidson has been in the news more for his personal life than for SNL as of late, having started a relationship with Kim Kardashian.
If the rumors are true, though, we may be seeing lots of new faces when SNL returns in the fall.

     Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson Could Be The Latest Celebs Moving To Australia, But It’s Not What You Think
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Speculation has it that Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, could very well be the next to take the 100-degree (Fahrenheit) plunge, but hold on, it’s not what you think.
In other words, no, Kim Kardashian isn’t angling to take over another corner of the market by establishing a SKIMS Down Under line.
However, Kim Kardashian will likely make "the land of the long weekend" live up to its name, if she goes with him at all.
Pete Davidson and Franz Rogowitz will star opposite each other as the two pothead leads who accidentally stumble into thievery.
Maybe a future season of the reality series sees Kim Kardashian jet down to the land of koalas and vegemite for Pete Davidson – if they’re still together by then.

     How will ‘Saturday Night Live’ say farewell to Pete Davidson and Kate McKinnon?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s time to bid farewell to some of your favorite “Saturday Night Live” cast members.
Reports are circulating, including from industry insider Variety, that Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant and Kyle Mooney will be saying their goodbyes with the May 21 season finale, which features “Russian Doll’s” Natasha Lyonne as host.
The burning question, however, is whether there will be any special tributes or sketches to honor the departing cast members.
When Will Ferrell left in 2002, his castmates appeared in a sketch that began by them singing his praises.
(At the end of the sketch, Ferrell made an appearance…and he confessed to stealing the Walkman.)

Davidson will be joined by Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon and Kyle Mooney.
Davidson joined the cast relatively unknown but has become an underrated presence throughout the years.
