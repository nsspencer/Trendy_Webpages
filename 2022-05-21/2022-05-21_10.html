     Ketlen Vieira upsets Holly Holm by split decision in UFC main event, inches closer to title shot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ketlen Vieira (13-2), of Manaus, Brazil, improved to 3-1 in her past four fought contests on Saturday, as she outpointed former champion Holly Holm (14-6) in a five-round main event.
That bout is a rematch of their shocking title fight in December, which Peña won via submission in the second round.
She found her distance with the straight right hand as the fight progressed, scoring on Holm at range -- where Holm is usually strongest.
She also nearly submitted Holm in the second round with a standing rear-naked choke, after Holm got careless in a takedown attempt.
The Albuquerque native had been knocking on the door of her first title fight since 2019, when she suffered a first-round knockout to Nunes.
