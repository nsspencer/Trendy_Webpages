     Day 2: Three things to look out for
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fellow champion Krejcikova may have a tough task ahead against France’s Diane Parry, who will enjoy the emphatic support of her home crowd.
Parry will leverage every 'allez' in her quest to upset the 2021 winner, who is competing in her first match since February after being sidelined with an arm injury.
The winner will face Colombian Camila Osorio in the second round.
After that, all eyes will be on Nadal — or rather, Nadal’s left foot — as the 13-time champion steps out on his happiest hunting ground to face Australia’s Jordan Thompson.
But if we’ve learned one thing over the years, it’s this: you can never count out Nadal in Paris.

     Alcaraz off and Running at Roland-Garros
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Chris Oddo | @TheFanChild | Sunday May 22, 2022Carlos Alcaraz blasted past Juan Ignacio Londero to open accounts at RG22 with intent.
The 19-year-old, tennis’ equivalent to the hottest thing since sliced break, started his second appearance at Roland-Garros with a jaw-dropping victory over Argentinian veteran Juan Ignacio Londero, 6-4, 6-2, 6-0.
6-4, 6-2, 6-0 on Juan Ignacio Londero.
52 years later it is virtually impossible to imagine Alcaraz losing a match so easily.
On Sunday Alcaraz – who says he prefers to be called Charlie or Carlitos – produced some electric tennis to take out Londero with ease.
