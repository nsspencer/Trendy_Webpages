     Summary: NEW YORK — White Sox catcher Yasmani Grandal didn’t even wait for Yankees designated hitter Josh Donaldson to get into the batter’s box.
Grandal was irate because he heard Donaldson had called White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson “Jackie Robinson” while he was running the bases in the second and third innings.
“Basically he’s trying to call me Jackie Robinson by, ‘What’s up Jackie?’ I don’t play like that.
It just joking around the fact that he called himself Jackie Robinson.
In the Sports Illustrated article that he was referring to, Anderson was quoted, “I kind of feel like today’s Jackie Robinson.
