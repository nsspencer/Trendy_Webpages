     'Emotional overload': Rutschman thrills in debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BALTIMORE -- ﻿Adley Rutschman﻿, the Orioles’ next big hope, has arrived -- and in style.
Called up before Saturday’s 6-1 loss to the Rays at Camden Yards almost three years after he was drafted, Rutschman -- baseball's No.
1 prospect per MLB Pipeline -- invited standing applause for nearly every facet: His announcement in the starting lineup, his first time announced as a batter (and each of the ensuing three times on the night), his first putout behind the plate and even, yes, his first strikeout.

     Orioles' Adley Rutschman Records First MLB Hit, Triples Against Tampa Bay Rays
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There was a palpable buzz at Camden Yards on Saturday night as MLB's top prospect and the Baltimore Orioles' top prospect, Adley Rutschman, made his MLB debut.
However, it's a hit he and Orioles fans alike are going to remember for a long time.
Something unique about the milestone is that Rutschman isn't the first big Orioles prospect to triple for his first MLB hit.
Orioles fans are hoping that Rutschman is going to be the face of the franchise for the foreseeable future.
Despite his first MLB hit, the Orioles fell victim to Randy Arozarena, who hit two home runs for the Rays on Saturday.

     Baltimore Orioles Promote MLB’s Top Catching Prospect, Adley Rutschman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rutschman also displays a plus arm and exchange behind the dish that should neutralize the running game even at the highest level.
OutlookRutschman’s combination of potentially elite hitting, elite fielding as well as elite makeup are rarely seen across the sport, and perhaps have never been seen before at the catching position.
Adley has the kind of special skill set where essentially any comp isn’t crazy.
Catchers who impact the game on both sides of the ball are just too rare nowadays.
Expect to see him with a chance to crack the Opening Day roster for the Orioles in 2022.

     Orioles' Adley Rutschman triples for first MLB hit vs. Rays
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baltimore Orioles catcher Adley Rutschman recorded his first big-league hit on Saturday night, just hours after being promoted from Triple-A, by tripling against the Tampa Bay Rays.
Even they won't be able to hold down Rutschman for long; he's the future of the catcher position.
Rutschman, 24 years old, had hit .309/.427/.515 with three home runs and more walks than strikeouts in 82 plate appearances in the minors.
He'd recorded just three triples in his professional career prior to Saturday night, with two of them coming in Triple-A last season.
Although the triple was Rutschman's first hit, it was not his first time on base.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Baltimore Orioles on Saturday announced that catcher Adley Rutschman, the consensus top prospect in all of baseball, is being called up to the majors.
Here's the official word:In order to create a roster spot for Rutschman, catcher Anthony Benboom has been designated for assignment.
In 179 games spread across three minor-league seasons, Rutschman has batted .282/.391/.488 with 30 home runs and 38 doubles.
This season, Rutschman was limited by a spring triceps injury, which eliminated any chance of his cracking Baltimore's Opening Day roster.
Overall, the Orioles have endured five straight losing seasons, and the deep rebuild has progressed dubiously under GM Mike Elias.

Not until the crowd at Camden Yards stood and cheered him, until he paused and turned to watch them do it, did glimpses of a better future start to pixelate the present.
He finished 1 for 3 with a walk in a game the Orioles lost, 6-1, one of the happiest nights at Camden Yards in years.
Rutschman, for example, watched Randy Arozarena dampen any hopes of an undefeated Orioles tenure with a two-run homer in his very first inning of major league work.
Hope settled in behind home plate in Baltimore on Saturday night.

And now that he's here, you should absolutely regard him as a top-12 catcher.
I'm slotting him seventh at the position right away, because why the heck not?
But the thing about the catcher position is that anyone with an inkling of potential becomes a priority play.

When he took the field for the first time, spinning around to take in his surroundings, the clamor grew again.
https://t.co/63sAHy9vuq — The Baltimore Sun (@baltimoresun) May 22, 2022Until recently, however, Rutschman had performed in a comparatively lesser spotlight.
Rutschman hit a ball down the right field line and kept chugging as Rays outfielder Brett Phillips stumbled over himself.
Heralded as one of the best catching prospects the game has seen, Adley Rutschman has faced almost insurmountable hype throughout his tenure with the organization.
