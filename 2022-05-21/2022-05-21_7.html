     Summary: On Thursday, ESPN’s Sage Steele was hit in the face by a Jon Rahm tee shot at the PGA Championship at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, OK. Steele received medical attention locally, then travelled home to Connecticut for further treatment.
So that certainly has significant injury potential, and Steele’s description of the medical care she needed afterwards in both Tulsa and Connecticut makes it clear this was serious.
Steele has been with ESPN since 2007, and has hosted the noon SportsCenter with Matt Barrie since February 2021.
She was covering this tournament for SportsCenter.
