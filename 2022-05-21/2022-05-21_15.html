     Indy 500 Qualifying Results 2022: Final Times from Saturday's Races
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeffrey Brown/Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesWith nearly half of the spots in the running order still to be decided, Rinus VeeKay has set the pace in qualifying for the Indianapolis 500.
He and the 11 other fastest drivers advance to the Fast 12 qualifying portion on Sunday.
Takuma Sato is a two-time winner of the Indianapolis 500, and a third checkered flag could be in the offing last month.
Sato's luck took a turn for the worse, however, on Saturday, and he was somewhat fortunate to narrowly making the Fast 12 cut.
Alexander Rossi won the Indianapolis 500 as a rookie in 2016 and notched three more top-10 finishes over the next three years.

Ultimately, the series, opted to toss out Sato's attempt, though Andretti was given no priority to turn a new qualifying run.
Sato managed to slide into 12th and hold on to make Sunday's Fast 12 field.
Missing out the first time aroundAfter the initial round of qualifying runs, only 29 cars had managed to record four-lap runs to slot them into the field.
Out of precaution, his team began changing out his engine following practice, and in doing so, missed his initial qualifying run of 17th in the order.

     Johnson on Indy 500 qualifying: “The speed scared my kids!”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Asked if there was a sentimental moment today, perhaps the posing with his family on the Speedway’s yard of bricks for the official qualifying photo, Johnson – who commentated on last year’s Indy 500 for NBC – cited two instances of reflection.
To just know what's happened in the course of 12 months and actually be in the racecar, that was a really neat moment.
I think the speed scared my kids!
“Granted, the conditions were pretty tricky, but I have never done a qualifying sim lap around here and never felt the boost.
“I just feel like I'm getting more reps [repetitions], more quality reps, understanding how to use my tools.
