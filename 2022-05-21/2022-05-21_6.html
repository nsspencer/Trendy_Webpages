     Baltimore Orioles Promote MLB’s Top Catching Prospect, Adley Rutschman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rutschman also displays a plus arm and exchange behind the dish that should neutralize the running game even at the highest level.
OutlookRutschman’s combination of potentially elite hitting, elite fielding as well as elite makeup are rarely seen across the sport, and perhaps have never been seen before at the catching position.
Adley has the kind of special skill set where essentially any comp isn’t crazy.
Catchers who impact the game on both sides of the ball are just too rare nowadays.
Expect to see him with a chance to crack the Opening Day roster for the Orioles in 2022.

     Orioles' Adley Rutschman triples for first MLB hit vs. Rays
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baltimore Orioles catcher Adley Rutschman recorded his first big-league hit on Saturday night, just hours after being promoted from Triple-A, by tripling against the Tampa Bay Rays.
Even they won't be able to hold down Rutschman for long; he's the future of the catcher position.
Rutschman, 24 years old, had hit .309/.427/.515 with three home runs and more walks than strikeouts in 82 plate appearances in the minors.
He'd recorded just three triples in his professional career prior to Saturday night, with two of them coming in Triple-A last season.
Although the triple was Rutschman's first hit, it was not his first time on base.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Baltimore Orioles on Saturday announced that catcher Adley Rutschman, the consensus top prospect in all of baseball, is being called up to the majors.
Here's the official word:In order to create a roster spot for Rutschman, catcher Anthony Benboom has been designated for assignment.
In 179 games spread across three minor-league seasons, Rutschman has batted .282/.391/.488 with 30 home runs and 38 doubles.
This season, Rutschman was limited by a spring triceps injury, which eliminated any chance of his cracking Baltimore's Opening Day roster.
Overall, the Orioles have endured five straight losing seasons, and the deep rebuild has progressed dubiously under GM Mike Elias.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadBALTIMORE — For the first time in far too long, hope stood behind home plate at Camden Yards on Saturday night.
Not until the crowd at Camden Yards stood and cheered him, until he paused and turned to watch them do it, did glimpses of a better future start to pixelate the present.
He finished 1 for 3 with a walk in a game the Orioles lost, 6-1, one of the happiest nights at Camden Yards in years.
Rutschman, for example, watched Randy Arozarena dampen any hopes of an undefeated Orioles tenure with a two-run homer in his very first inning of major league work.
Hope settled in behind home plate in Baltimore on Saturday night.

And now that he's here, you should absolutely regard him as a top-12 catcher.
I'm slotting him seventh at the position right away, because why the heck not?
But the thing about the catcher position is that anyone with an inkling of potential becomes a priority play.

     Summary: The Orioles announced that they have selected the contract of top prospect Adley Rutschman.
Due to the struggles of the big league club, Rutschman instantly became the light at the end of the tunnel for Baltimore fans.
The Orioles finished last in the AL East in both 2017 and 2018, and were in the process of repeating that feat when Rutschman was drafted in 2019.
It started out normal enough, with Rutschman getting into 37 games in the lower levels of the Orioles’ system in the months after the draft.
With Rutschman injured to start the year, the club selected Bemboom’s contract, pairing him with Chirinos as the club’s catching duo.

     Summary: Rutschman then dominated as a junior, hitting .411/.575/.751 with 17 homers and twice as many walks as strikeouts.
That production, combined with his profile made Rutschman a generational prospect: a switch-hitting catcher with elite on-base ability and defensive skills so polished, some evaluators believed he could catch in the Majors three years ago.
\"From the moment you're drafted or from when you're in high school, I think you are always are looking forward to this opportunity, hoping it happens,\" Rutschman said.
I'm just trying to take it in.\"Said O's manager Brandon Hyde: \"It's Mike \\[Elias\\]'s first pick and it's been a process from the day we got here.
