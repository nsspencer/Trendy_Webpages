     Bubba Watson follows historic Friday 63 with five bogeys, Saturday 73 at PGA ChampionshipBUBBA
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TULSA, Okla. – Bubba Watson is no stranger to dramatic swings, but even by his high-flying standards, this was a bit much.
The southpaw followed a round-of-the-week 63 on Friday with a 73 in Round 3 of the PGA Championship on Saturday.
He finished his round with three bogeys over his final four holes.
Maybe that's the problem, maybe I was wishing them instead of stroking them,” Watson said.
He’ll start the final round seven shots off the lead held by Mito Pereira.

     PGA Championship 2022: Bubba Watson flirts with another major as only Bubba can do
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ahead of him, Will Zalatoris was clearly feeling the pressure of leading a major, and Watson’s playing partner Justin Thomas was massively out of sorts from the start on his way to a disappointing 74.
Nobody was making a massive charge from below, and only Mito Pereira, with birdies on Nos.
2 and 5, was holding up his end of the bargain at the top.
A bogey at the third momentarily set Bubba back, but on the short par-4 fourth, he unleashed a 318-yard bomb, pitched 60 yards onto the green and buried the five-footer for birdie.
For a very brief moment, if you blurred your eyes just a little and forgot the vast expanse of time and fate between now and Sunday night, you could see your way into believing the 2022 PGA Championship had become a two-horse race.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watson made three birdies on the front nine and only dropped a shot at the par-4 third.
At 18, the 471-yard par-4 behemoth, the two-time Masters champion had a putt for the course record but the 22-footer just went past the edge of the cup.
Watson revealed that as he's "older" now he's switched up the shafts in his driver.
Now he is using a 60g driver shaft in his PING driver whereas before he was using a 90g one.
"I was like, we need to go ahead and hit it in the rough.

     Summary: It’s been a long time since Bubba Watson contended for the PGA Championship.
Still, a 3-over 73 was good enough to keep the 43-year-old within sight of the youth movement leading the championship heading into Sunday’s final round.
He’ll start the final round tied for seventh, seven strokes behind 27-year-old rookie leader Mito Pereira.
“I have confidence that I’ve done it before, but these guys are so good,” Watson said.
Watson jumped up into the mix with that stunning 63 on Friday that tied the lowest score in PGA Championship history.

“I was like, ‘we need to go ahead and hit it in the rough,'” Watson said.
