     What to expect from Adley Rutschman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Orioles were coming off of a 115-loss season in 2018 when they hired Mike Elias from the Houston Astros to be their general manager.
The following June, Elias was able to make his first truly big stamp on the team’s future and its rebuilding plan by having the No.
1 overall pick.
And as good as Witt was, and will be, it was a year where it was pretty clear-cut who the top pick should be.
In his three years at Oregon State, not only did Rutschman hit .353/.473/.559, win a national title as a sophomore and the Golden Spikes Award as a junior, he carried himself like a generational prospect who could help a team turn things around while effortlessly shouldering the burden of being “the man.”

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rutschman also displays a plus arm and exchange behind the dish that should neutralize the running game even at the highest level.
OutlookRutschman’s combination of potentially elite hitting, elite fielding as well as elite makeup are rarely seen across the sport, and perhaps have never been seen before at the catching position.
Adley has the kind of special skill set where essentially any comp isn’t crazy.
Catchers who impact the game on both sides of the ball are just too rare nowadays.
Expect to see him with a chance to crack the Opening Day roster for the Orioles in 2022.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Baltimore Orioles on Saturday announced that catcher Adley Rutschman, the consensus top prospect in all of baseball, is being called up to the majors.
Here's the official word:In order to create a roster spot for Rutschman, catcher Anthony Benboom has been designated for assignment.
In 179 games spread across three minor-league seasons, Rutschman has batted .282/.391/.488 with 30 home runs and 38 doubles.
This season, Rutschman was limited by a spring triceps injury, which eliminated any chance of his cracking Baltimore's Opening Day roster.
Overall, the Orioles have endured five straight losing seasons, and the deep rebuild has progressed dubiously under GM Mike Elias.

Rodríguez is the best at .698, which in his park in this year is above MLB average, but still.
For today, there’s no reason not to dream that this is the start of better things for the Orioles.

     Summary: The Orioles announced that they have selected the contract of top prospect Adley Rutschman.
Due to the struggles of the big league club, Rutschman instantly became the light at the end of the tunnel for Baltimore fans.
The Orioles finished last in the AL East in both 2017 and 2018, and were in the process of repeating that feat when Rutschman was drafted in 2019.
It started out normal enough, with Rutschman getting into 37 games in the lower levels of the Orioles’ system in the months after the draft.
With Rutschman injured to start the year, the club selected Bemboom’s contract, pairing him with Chirinos as the club’s catching duo.

     Summary: Rutschman then dominated as a junior, hitting .411/.575/.751 with 17 homers and twice as many walks as strikeouts.
That production, combined with his profile made Rutschman a generational prospect: a switch-hitting catcher with elite on-base ability and defensive skills so polished, some evaluators believed he could catch in the Majors three years ago.
\"From the moment you're drafted or from when you're in high school, I think you are always are looking forward to this opportunity, hoping it happens,\" Rutschman said.
I'm just trying to take it in.\"Said O's manager Brandon Hyde: \"It's Mike \\[Elias\\]'s first pick and it's been a process from the day we got here.
