     PGA Championship: Thunderstorms drop rain on Southern Hills, softening course
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TULSA, Okla. — Strong thunderstorms rolled through central and eastern Oklahoma overnight, lighting up the sky and dropping 0.4 inches of rain on Southern Hills Country Club, the site of the 2022 PGA Championship.
Friday’s forecast had originally called for storms to start arriving in the area as the last players were completing their second round, but the rain held off and play was completed.
The official PGA Championship weather report states there is a small chance of more rain this morning, with temperatures topping out in the mid-50s, which is 30 degrees colder than Thursday or Friday.
The wind is expected to hold between 10 and 15 mph for most of the day, but gusts of up to 30 mph are possible.
As the name suggests, Southern Hills is covered by slopes and there is a creek that works through several holes, so the course drains well.

     Summary: Southern Hills Country Club was greeted to rave reviews earlier this week, with Wells Fargo Championship winner Max Homa tweeting on Monday, "I’ve only seen 9 holes and Southern Hills is already up there with the best courses I’ve played in my life."
On Friday, Englishman Tyrrell Hatton took the PGA Championship course setup to task.
On Saturday, it was Patton Kizzire.
"I mean, we're playing a major championship, not a monthly medal," Hatton said after his Friday 68.
So you can hit a great putt and they just don't look like going in, which is hard to accept when we're playing in a major championship."
