     Baltimore Orioles Promote MLB’s Top Catching Prospect, Adley Rutschman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rutschman also displays a plus arm and exchange behind the dish that should neutralize the running game even at the highest level.
OutlookRutschman’s combination of potentially elite hitting, elite fielding as well as elite makeup are rarely seen across the sport, and perhaps have never been seen before at the catching position.
Adley has the kind of special skill set where essentially any comp isn’t crazy.
Catchers who impact the game on both sides of the ball are just too rare nowadays.
Expect to see him with a chance to crack the Opening Day roster for the Orioles in 2022.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Catcher Adley Rutschman, the top pick in the 2019 MLB Draft and widely considered the best prospect in the game, will make his big-league debut for the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards on Saturday night, according to a source.
The Orioles announced Saturday morning they had called up Rutschman.
The catcher, who was in Charlotte, N.C., with the Triple-A Norfolk Tides through Thursday night, is joining the team for a home series against the Tampa Bay Rays.
Rutschman, the 2018 NCAA College World Series MVP with national champion Oregon State, has slashed .282/.391/.488 in 179 career minor-league games.
Rutschman will be the eighth first-round pick from the 2019 draft to make his major-league debut.

     Summary: With a surprise 8 o’clock on a Saturday morning email, the Orioles have made the announcement that fans have been looking forward to since Adley Rutschman was drafted at #1 overall three years ago.
The beginning of every big league story also marks the end of somebody else’s, or at least an interruption of theirs.
The corresponding roster move for Rutschman’s contract being selected was that Anthony Bemboom has been designated for assignment.
Rodríguez is the best at .698, which in his park in this year is above MLB average, but still.
For today, there’s no reason not to dream that this is the start of better things for the Orioles.

     Orioles To Promote Adley Rutschman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Orioles announced that they have selected the contract of top prospect Adley Rutschman.
Due to the struggles of the big league club, Rutschman instantly became the light at the end of the tunnel for Baltimore fans.
The Orioles finished last in the AL East in both 2017 and 2018, and were in the process of repeating that feat when Rutschman was drafted in 2019.
It started out normal enough, with Rutschman getting into 37 games in the lower levels of the Orioles’ system in the months after the draft.
With Rutschman injured to start the year, the club selected Bemboom’s contract, pairing him with Chirinos as the club’s catching duo.

Rutschman then dominated as a junior, hitting .411/.575/.751 with 17 homers and twice as many walks as strikeouts.
That production, combined with his profile made Rutschman a generational prospect: a switch-hitting catcher with elite on-base ability and defensive skills so polished, some evaluators believed he could catch in the Majors three years ago.
Said one rival scout in 2021: “It’s as complete a package of physical tools, accompanying skill to enact those tools and makeup traits that you’re going to find, particularly at that position.” The Orioles are hoping it translates into their new face of the franchise for years to come.
