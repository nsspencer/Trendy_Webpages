     Baltimore Orioles Promote MLB’s Top Catching Prospect, Adley Rutschman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rutschman also displays a plus arm and exchange behind the dish that should neutralize the running game even at the highest level.
OutlookRutschman’s combination of potentially elite hitting, elite fielding as well as elite makeup are rarely seen across the sport, and perhaps have never been seen before at the catching position.
Adley has the kind of special skill set where essentially any comp isn’t crazy.
Catchers who impact the game on both sides of the ball are just too rare nowadays.
Expect to see him with a chance to crack the Opening Day roster for the Orioles in 2022.

     Summary: BALTIMORE -- ﻿Adley Rutschman﻿, the Orioles’ next big hope, has arrived -- and in style.
Called up before Saturday’s 6-1 loss to the Rays at Camden Yards almost three years after he was drafted, Rutschman -- baseball's No.
1 prospect per MLB Pipeline -- invited standing applause for nearly every facet: His announcement in the starting lineup, his first time announced as a batter (and each of the ensuing three times on the night), his first putout behind the plate and even, yes, his first strikeout.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baltimore Orioles catcher Adley Rutschman recorded his first big-league hit on Saturday night, just hours after being promoted from Triple-A, by tripling against the Tampa Bay Rays.
Even they won't be able to hold down Rutschman for long; he's the future of the catcher position.
Rutschman, 24 years old, had hit .309/.427/.515 with three home runs and more walks than strikeouts in 82 plate appearances in the minors.
He'd recorded just three triples in his professional career prior to Saturday night, with two of them coming in Triple-A last season.
Although the triple was Rutschman's first hit, it was not his first time on base.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadBALTIMORE — For the first time in far too long, hope stood behind home plate at Camden Yards on Saturday night.
Not until the crowd at Camden Yards stood and cheered him, until he paused and turned to watch them do it, did glimpses of a better future start to pixelate the present.
He finished 1 for 3 with a walk in a game the Orioles lost, 6-1, one of the happiest nights at Camden Yards in years.
Rutschman, for example, watched Randy Arozarena dampen any hopes of an undefeated Orioles tenure with a two-run homer in his very first inning of major league work.
Hope settled in behind home plate in Baltimore on Saturday night.

However, it's a hit he and Orioles fans alike are going to remember for a long time.
Something unique about the milestone is that Rutschman isn't the first big Orioles prospect to triple for his first MLB hit.
Orioles fans are hoping that Rutschman is going to be the face of the franchise for the foreseeable future.
Despite his first MLB hit, the Orioles fell victim to Randy Arozarena, who hit two home runs for the Rays on Saturday.
