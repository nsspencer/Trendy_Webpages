     Kylian Mbapp√© Will Stay at P.S.G., Rejecting Real Madrid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Mbapp√© had made no secret of his desire to move to Real Madrid from P.S.G., and the Spanish powerhouse went all out to recruit him.
His expiring contract in Paris also meant he was a free agent, available without a multimillion-dollar transfer fee.
In addition to the nine-figure signing bonus and the stunning annual salary ‚Äî a huge offer even by Real Madrid‚Äôs standards ‚Äî the club also was said to have offered Mbapp√© complete control over his image rights, a lucrative revenue stream that Real Madrid typically shares with its roster of stars.
and its Qatari owners managed to offer an even better deal in a transfer soap opera that has dragged on for more than a year, ever since Real Madrid first tried to extract Mbapp√© from Paris with the offer of a record transfer fee.
For P.S.G., retaining Mbapp√© provides a welcome highlight in a season that has been played against a backdrop of uncertainty after yet another failure in the Champions League.
