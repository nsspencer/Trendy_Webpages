     Japanese Breakfast Makes Her ‘SNL’ Debut With Beaming Performances Of ‘Be Sweet’ And ‘Paprika’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After almost four years without an album, Michelle Zauner returned with Jubilee, her third album as Japanese Breakfast, last summer.
Jubilee brought Japanese Breakfast plenty of accolades and first-time moments, like two Grammy nominations, to magnify the success of the album.
It also earned her the opportunity to make her debut on Saturday Night Live which she did last night.
Japanese Breakfast’s performance on Saturday Night Live occurred on the show’s season 47 finale.
You can watch both of Japanese Breakfast’s SNL performances in the videos above.

     Watch Japanese Breakfast Explain “Jimmy Fallon Big!” And Eat Hot Dogs With Jimmy Fallon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One year after performing “Jimmy Fallon Big!” on The Tonight Show, Japanese Breakfast’s Michelle Zauner actually got to sit down with Fallon to explain the meaning behind the song named for him (appearing on the band’s 2017 album Soft Sounds From Another Planet).
“Before Japanese Breakfast, I used to be in a very unpopular punk band called Little Big League,” Zauner explained to Fallon.
I wish we could continue on together, but this other band has invited me to play, and we’re gonna be Jimmy Fallon big.
Zauner, who is performing with Japanese Breakfast tonight on the season finale of Saturday Night Live, also talked about going to get some Nathan’s hot dogs after the Grammys this year.
'”Fallon was so charmed by the Nathan’s story that he brought out a platter of hot dogs to enjoy with Zauner.

     Saturday Night Live: Japanese Breakfast performs ‘Be Sweet,’ ‘Paprika’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tonight marked the Saturday Night Live finale, and that allowed Japanese Breakfast to have some time in the spotlight as the musical guest.
The opening song tonight was “Be Sweet,” which is a new track released earlier this year.
The music is by and large upbeat, and we think the show was going for a fun, celebratory atmosphere tonight.
This opening performance was fun and infectious, and we can’t ask for anything more as someone who wasn’t super-familiar with the band’s work entering the show tonight.
