When I'm not there, they'll be like, 'Ha ha ha, Pete's a f***ing jerk face.'
If I'm the joke or I'm in on the joke."

     Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, others set to leave 'SNL'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cast members Aidy Bryant, Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, and Kyle Mooney are set to leave the show after tonight's 47th season finale, Variety reported yesterday based on an insider source.
McKinnon and Bryant have the longest tenure of the four, having joined in 2012.
Mooney joined in 2013, and Davidson in 2014.
Davidson has been in the news more for his personal life than for SNL as of late, having started a relationship with Kim Kardashian.
If the rumors are true, though, we may be seeing lots of new faces when SNL returns in the fall.

     ‘SNL’: Pete Davidson Confirms Exit From Sketch Series — Read Statement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just hours before its Season 47 finale, Pete Davidson took to Instagram to confirm his upcoming exit from Saturday Night Live.
In the video, I had just gotten back from doing my very first update and sketch.
I figured since I’m a stand up, I’ll just try my stand up and personal bits on Weekend Update as myself and I’m so glad I did.
—Davidson joined SNL in 2014 as a featured player before eventually becoming a full-time repertory player.
One of the youngest cast members in the show’s history (he was just 20 when he debuted), he became known for his “Weekend Update” appearances and digital shorts.

     Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson Could Be The Latest Celebs Moving To Australia, But It’s Not What You Think
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Speculation has it that Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, could very well be the next to take the 100-degree (Fahrenheit) plunge, but hold on, it’s not what you think.
In other words, no, Kim Kardashian isn’t angling to take over another corner of the market by establishing a SKIMS Down Under line.
However, Kim Kardashian will likely make "the land of the long weekend" live up to its name, if she goes with him at all.
Pete Davidson and Franz Rogowitz will star opposite each other as the two pothead leads who accidentally stumble into thievery.
Maybe a future season of the reality series sees Kim Kardashian jet down to the land of koalas and vegemite for Pete Davidson – if they’re still together by then.
