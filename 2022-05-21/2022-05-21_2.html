     Summary: Watch : Pete Davidson Cracks JOKES About Kanye WestLive From New York, it's Pete Davidson's official Saturday Night Live departure.
Pete, who doesn't use social media, had pal Dave Sirus post a heartfelt message and throwback video to his Instagram account featuring Pete sharing an animated hug with Jerrod Carmichael.
"Jerrod sent it to me last night and it made me super emotional in the best way," Pete wrote of the clip.
"In the video I had just gotten back from doing my very first update and sketch.
Pete admitted when he first joined SNL at age 20, he "had no idea" what he was doing because he "wasn't really a sketch performer."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cast members Aidy Bryant, Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, and Kyle Mooney are set to leave the show after tonight's 47th season finale, Variety reported yesterday based on an insider source.
McKinnon and Bryant have the longest tenure of the four, having joined in 2012.
Mooney joined in 2013, and Davidson in 2014.
Davidson has been in the news more for his personal life than for SNL as of late, having started a relationship with Kim Kardashian.
If the rumors are true, though, we may be seeing lots of new faces when SNL returns in the fall.

     Pete Davidson to Exit 'Saturday Night Live' After Eight Years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pete Davidson is set to exit Saturday Night Live after the show’s 47th season later this weekend.
Davidson will be joined by Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon and Kyle Mooney.
Davidson joined the cast relatively unknown but has become an underrated presence throughout the years.
All four cast members have become mainstays for the program over the years and leave big shoes to fill following their exit.
Davidson’s tenure included his popular “Weekend Update,” impression of the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and actor Rami Malek.

     ‘SNL’: Pete Davidson Confirms Exit From Sketch Series — Read Statement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just hours before its Season 47 finale, Pete Davidson took to Instagram to confirm his upcoming exit from Saturday Night Live.
In the video, I had just gotten back from doing my very first update and sketch.
I figured since I’m a stand up, I’ll just try my stand up and personal bits on Weekend Update as myself and I’m so glad I did.
— Resident young person Pete Davidson—Davidson joined SNL in 2014 as a featured player before eventually becoming a full-time repertory player.
One of the youngest cast members in the show’s history (he was just 20 when he debuted), he became known for his “Weekend Update” appearances and digital shorts.

     Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson Could Be The Latest Celebs Moving To Australia, But It’s Not What You Think
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Speculation has it that Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, could very well be the next to take the 100-degree (Fahrenheit) plunge, but hold on, it’s not what you think.
In other words, no, Kim Kardashian isn’t angling to take over another corner of the market by establishing a SKIMS Down Under line.
However, Kim Kardashian will likely make "the land of the long weekend" live up to its name, if she goes with him at all.
Pete Davidson and Franz Rogowitz will star opposite each other as the two pothead leads who accidentally stumble into thievery.
Maybe a future season of the reality series sees Kim Kardashian jet down to the land of koalas and vegemite for Pete Davidson – if they’re still together by then.

     How will ‘Saturday Night Live’ say farewell to Pete Davidson and Kate McKinnon?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s time to bid farewell to some of your favorite “Saturday Night Live” cast members.
Reports are circulating, including from industry insider Variety, that Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant and Kyle Mooney will be saying their goodbyes with the May 21 season finale, which features “Russian Doll’s” Natasha Lyonne as host.
The burning question, however, is whether there will be any special tributes or sketches to honor the departing cast members.
When Will Ferrell left in 2002, his castmates appeared in a sketch that began by them singing his praises.
(At the end of the sketch, Ferrell made an appearance…and he confessed to stealing the Walkman.)
