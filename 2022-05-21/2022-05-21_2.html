    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RALEIGH, N.C. -- Brendan Smith scored a shorthanded goal late in the second period while Antti Raanta finished with 21 saves to help the Carolina Hurricanes beat the New York Rangers 2-0 on Friday night, taking a 2-0 lead in their second-round playoff series.
Aho added a clinching empty-net score to finish this off with 1.8 seconds left as Raanta held up.
Carolina improved to 6-0 at home in the playoffs and has a 2-0 lead for the second consecutive round.
And the Rangers will try to mount another series comeback after rallying from a 3-1 deficit to beat Pittsburgh in a seven-game first-round series.
Shesterkin finished with 20 saves to lead the Rangers on a night with few offensive highlights.

     Summary: And Antti Raanta, well, he never had a postseason game like this.
“I think if we just stick to our style, it’s eventually going to wear on teams and we’re going to find a way to win,” Smith said.
And the Rangers must mount another series comeback after rallying from a 3-1 deficit to beat Pittsburgh in a seven-game first-round series.
We probably could’ve, but that’s the way it goes.”Igor Shesterkin finished with 20 saves to lead the Rangers on a night with few offensive highlights.
Most notably, Teravainen moved up to the top line to play alongside Aho and rookie Seth Jarvis, while Andrei Svechnikov moved to the second line.

     Hurricanes’ Antti Raanta using Henrik Lundqvist lessons to stifle Rangers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sitting at the podium and facing a question about Carolina backup goaltender Antti Raanta following the Hurricanes’ victory over the Rangers in Game 2 of their second-round playoff series, Brendan Smith’s mind drifted to Henrik Lundqvist.
Smith, who joined the Rangers during the 2016-17 season, was not in New York at Lundqvist’s peak.
But the Carolina defenseman, who scored the first goal in the Hurricanes’ 2-0 win on Friday night, recalls the competitive instinct that made Lundqvist great.
Antti Raanta makes a save during the Hurricanes’ Game 2 win over the Rangers.
It’s not quite in the mold of what Lundqvist did when Raanta was backing him up.

     About Last Night: An unlikely hero, again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In another tightly contested game with another unlikely goal-scoring hero, the Carolina Hurricanes took hold of a 2-0 series lead Friday night with a 2-0 win over the Rangers in PNC Arena.
Antti Raanta picked up the first postseason shutout of his NHL career, stopping all 21 shots he faced Friday night.
It was the most unlikely of players in the most unlikely of scenarios, as Aho got out on a shorthanded rush as the Canes killed off a four-minute penalty on Brady Skjei.
While they didn’t generate too much in the terms of offense, the Canes were brilliant defensively as they completely stifled the Rangers throughout the night.
The Rangers didn’t do a great job of getting into dangerous areas, and when they did Raanta was as phenomenal as he’s been all series long.

     NHL playoffs results daily: Brendan Smith brings the pain to his old team as Hurricanes go up 2-0
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some combination of the Hurricanes’ penalty kill — four spotless outings, plus Smith’s goal — and another great game by Antti Raanta.
The away team fell below 35 percent of the expected goals share in the first at five-on-five, then made incremental improvements the next period at 42 percent.
They gained the edge in expected goals over the Flames midway through the third, according to MoneyPuck.
The final count was 9.13 expected goals for Edmonton to 3.51 for Calgary.
The moment of the game: McDavid set up Draisaitl for a goal that would have pulled the Oilers within one.
