     Kylian Mbappé Will Stay at P.S.G., Rejecting Real Madrid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Mbappé had made no secret of his desire to move to Real Madrid from P.S.G., and the Spanish powerhouse went all out to recruit him.
His expiring contract in Paris also meant he was a free agent, available without a multimillion-dollar transfer fee.
In addition to the nine-figure signing bonus and the stunning annual salary — a huge offer even by Real Madrid’s standards — the club also was said to have offered Mbappé complete control over his image rights, a lucrative revenue stream that Real Madrid typically shares with its roster of stars.
and its Qatari owners managed to offer an even better deal in a transfer soap opera that has dragged on for more than a year, ever since Real Madrid first tried to extract Mbappé from Paris with the offer of a record transfer fee.
For P.S.G., retaining Mbappé provides a welcome highlight in a season that has been played against a backdrop of uncertainty after yet another failure in the Champions League.

     PSG and Mbappe live updates: Striker rejects Real Madrid and signs new contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Good morning, and welcome to The Athletic's coverage of today's live football news as Kylian Mbappe has agreed to remain at Paris Saint-Germain despite prolonged negotiations with Real Madrid.
The 23-year-old prodigy has been at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war between PSG and Real since last summer.
The biggest talent in world football has, however, agreed to extend his stay with the French champions having joined them in 2017 from Monaco.
In other news, ahead of the final day of the Premier League season on Sunday there is plenty to stay abreast with.
Saturday will also see Sunderland take on Wycombe Wanderers for the chance to return to the Championship.

     Kylian Mbappe decision: PSG superstar to stay in Paris, turns down lucrative offer from Real Madrid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arguably the top young talent in all of world soccer will stay with Paris Saint-Germain instead of joining UEFA Champions League finalists Real Madrid.
PSG announced that he was staying before the team's final Ligue 1 match of the campaign on Saturday against Metz.
In a short video, Mbappe says "This is Paris," as he stands high up at the Parc des Princes.
"I am very happy to be staying in Paris -- my city," Mbappe said to the fans.
Keeping Mbappe allows the club to continue fielding him alongside Messi and Neymar in the attack -- assuming that neither move on this summer.

     Kylian Mbappe Stays at PSG, Snubs Real Madrid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mbappé reportedly spoke with Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez to inform him of his decision and also communicated his intentions to PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino and his teammates, per ESPN.
A now-famous photo of Mbappé circulated a few years ago of the player sitting in his boyhood bedroom, which was covered with posters of Cristiano Ronaldo playing for Real Madrid.
Mbappé, meanwhile, stays at PSG and continues to team with Lionel Messi and Neymar in the most star-studded attacking trident on the planet.
He has also won a UEFA Nations League title with his country.
The word on Friday was that PSG and Real Madrid had made seismic offers of equal financial might, leaving it down to a personal choice.
