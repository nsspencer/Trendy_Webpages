     Who won The Match 2022? Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth rout Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy in 10 holes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What was supposed to be a welcome return to competition for Tiger Woods quickly turned into a beatdown.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas took it to Woods and Rory McIlroy early and often Saturday evening at Pelican Golf Club before ultimately winning the seventh edition of The Match by a score of 3&amp;2.
Competing in a 12-hole charity exhibition for the benefit of Hurricane Ian relief efforts, Tiger showed signs of life when he matched J.T.
"I think Rory described it right when he said that it was the ham and the egg white, not quite the egg," said Spieth.

     Five takeaways from The Match
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Match wasn’t close but the trash talk and antics kept things entertaining.
The best explanation came from Spieth on his match-winning approach shot from the pine straw, which he hit 5 feet from a pin tucked close to water.
“I was just trying to get on top of it and play a cut.
If you end up hitting pine straw first, it could go anywhere,” Spieth said.
Thomas joked that announcer Charles Barkley was eyeing the full moon “like it’s an Oreo.”The Thomas-Barkley banter continued as they discussed their rival alma maters.

     Summary: Tiger Woods schedule: Where might we see Tiger Woods play next?
But where might we see Woods play in 2023?
Where we might see Tiger Woods play nextWoods has said for some time now his playing schedule won’t be near what it was several years ago when he was healthier, and things changed even more following his February 2021 car accident.
The Farmers isn’t one of the Tour’s elevated events for 2023, meaning Woods might not bother.
It’s a lot of work to be an event’s host, let alone player-host.
