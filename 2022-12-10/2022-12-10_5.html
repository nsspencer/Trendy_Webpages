     UFC 282 video: 18-year-old Raul Rosas Jr. makes quick work of Jay Perrin with rear-naked choke in first round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Raul Rosas Jr. was already the youngest fighter to ever compete in the UFC and now he’s the youngest fighter to get a win inside the octagon.
The 18-year-old Contender Series veteran made quick work of Jay Perrin in the featured prelim at UFC 282 as he secured an early takedown and wrapped up a rear-naked choke to earn the submission victory.
Following the win, Rosas made a call to receive a post-fight bonus and his justification might actually deserve some consideration.
Rosas was methodical as he looked for the rear-naked with Perrin doing his best to fight the hands in an effort to break free.
It’s hard to imagine going to class in high school just recently and then getting a win in the UFC but that’s exactly what Rosas has managed.
