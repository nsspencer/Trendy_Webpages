     Saturday Night Live: Brandi Carlile performs ‘The Story’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We knew entering this weekend’s Saturday Night Live that Brandi Carlile was going to be the musical guest.
The first surprise here is that Brandi opted to perform an older hit in “The Story” rather than something new and honestly, we’re not all that made about it.
It was great to get Steve Martin and Martin Short as hosts, and this took it to another level.
As for the second performance, Brandi did a more recent song in “You and Me On The Rock,” but one that was equally fantastic in its own way.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s been just over a year since singer-songwriter fave Brandi Carlile made her SNL debut on the heels of releasing her seventh album In These Silent Days.
Now, with Carlile receiving seven Grammy nominations — not to mention the 2023 edition of her Girls Just Wanna weekend happening in January, as well as a West Coast revival of her Joni Jam with the iconic Joni Mitchell set for next summer — she returned to Studio 8H for an encore performance last night.
Surrounded by holiday lights, Carlile and her band performed her first big hit, “The Story,” and did a version of her latest hit, “You And Me On The Rock,” for a poignant how-it-started-how-it’s-going moment; Lucius joined her to sing backup vocals on the Silent Days track.

     Brandi Carlile on Her Incredible Year—and Paying It Forward
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While the music industry struggled, coming back in fits and starts as the pandemic receded, the genre-straddling musical artist Brandi Carlile ‘s year was epic beyond all measure.
Her memoir, “Broken Horses,” released last year, became a worldwide bestseller.
And her album “In These Silent Days” racked up seven Grammy nominations in November, and led to a massive tour that stretched throughout this year.
That tour, most notably, included a stop at the Newport Folk Festival, where Ms. Carlile, 42, brought her hero, Joni Mitchell , on stage for Ms. Mitchell’s first live appearance in 20 years.
And, capping off her exceptional year, in November Ms. Carlile joined another of her longtime heroes, Elton John , at Dodger Stadium, for what was billed as his final U.S. concert performance.
