     UFC 282 results: Ilia Topuria dispatches Bryce Mitchell with nasty arm-triangle choke in second round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The undefeated featherweight proved that yet again with a dominant performance over Bryce Mitchell before wrapping up a nasty arm-triangle choke to get the submission win over a noted ground specialist in the opening bout on the main card at UFC 282.
The stoppage came at 3:10 in the second round after Mitchell was forced to tap with Topuria locking on the fight-ending choke.
“I want a title fight next if not … let’s do UFC Spain,” Topuria said afterwards.
As the second round got underway, Topuria was throwing heat behind every punch and that led to a huge shot landing that sat Mitchell down on the canvas.
It’s likely he’ll be staring down an even bigger fight in his next appearance in the UFC.
