     2022 Heisman Trophy winner: USC QB Caleb Williams claims award giving Trojans most Heismans in history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: USC quarterback Caleb Williams has won the 2022 Heisman Trophy after a standout sophomore season under first-year coach Lincoln Riley, who has now coached three Heisman winners over his six seasons as a head coach, all of whom were transfers.
Williams passed for 4,075 yards, 37 touchdowns and just four interceptions while completing 66.1% of his passes this season.
Williams beating all three for college football's most prestigious individual award demonstrates his importance to USC's success this season.
Like 2021 Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young of Alabama, Williams is expected to play another season of college football as he will not be eligible for the NFL Draft until after his junior season.
