     Why Celtics’ Jayson Tatum downplayed Warriors loss in NBA Finals rematch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — The lights and stakes don’t get much higher for a regular season game in December than it did Saturday.
The Celtics and Warriors met for the first time since last season’s NBA Finals, putting a spotlight on the marquee matchup.
The Celtics looked uncomfortable as their leader, Jayson Tatum, had one of the worst games of his young season.
Yet, even after such a tough loss, Tatum was far from overreacting to a long season.
It’s frustrating to lose, Tatum said, but there are still plenty of games left in the season to flip the page.
