At UFC Fight Island 1 in 2020, Gordon defeated Chris Fishgold, who trains alongside Pimblett at Liverpool‚Äôs Next Generation MMA gym.
After establishing that the initial callout came out of the Brit‚Äôs mouth rather than his, ‚ÄúFlash‚Äù Gordon sent Pimblett a warning.

     Paddy Pimblett‚Äôs mental health gimmick becoming more and more hollow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paddy Pimblett became the de facto face of men‚Äôs mental health after his second-round win over American fighter Jordan Leavitt, largely thanks to his post-fight speech about the passing of his friend.
But it rings more and more hollow with every offensive thing that comes out of the Liverpool man‚Äôs mouth.
This came as Pimblett kept insisting that Topuria ‚Äúspeak English‚Äù, and not ‚ÄúGerman or Spanish, like you‚Äôre from‚Äù.
Pimblett can continue to speak well about mental health, and ending the stigma, as much as he wants.
But if he doesn‚Äôt stop his deeply offensive comments about other countries and immigrants, it will always ring hollow.

     Summary: Free live streams of Paddy ‚ÄòThe Baddy‚Äô Pimblett in his latest UFC contest have been spreading online (UFC)Paddy Pimblett steps into the Octogan at UFC 282 on Saturday to face Jared Gordon, in what is arguably his toughest MMA contest to date.
As with other major fights in 2022, the high price to watch UFC 282 means many fans will likely seek illegal free live streams online.
Dozens of illegal live streaming sites have popped up in recent years, with some attracting millions of viewers for box office fights.
The prevalence of free live streams comes despite a renewed crackdown on online piracy from law enforcement in the UK, as well as warnings from cyber security experts that they pose a risk to online viewers.
Recent research from security firm Zscaler also found that a surge of live streaming sites were targeting football fans looking for ways to watch World Cup matches online for free.
