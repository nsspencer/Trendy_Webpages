     UFC 282 live blog: Paddy Pimblett vs. Jared Gordon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is the UFC 282 live blog for Paddy Pimblett vs. Jared Gordon, the lightweight co-main event on Saturday in Las Vegas.
Despite this being only his fourth fight in the UFC, Pimblett has already established himself as one of the biggest stars in all of MMA.
The former Cage Warriors featherweight champion has made a name for himself on the back of his exciting fighting style and unique personality, and though he’s 3-0 inside the UFC, Jared Gordon represents a notable step up in competition for “The Baddy.”A UFC fighter since 2017, Gordon has spent most of his time in the promotion at lightweight, where he’s proven to be an incredibly difficult out for anyone.
With a 7-4 record in the UFC, Gordon’s losses have come against some of the very best lightweights in the world, and on Saturday, “Flash” hopes to prove that Pimblett is not in that class of fighter.

     Paddy Pimblett’s mental health gimmick becoming more and more hollow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paddy Pimblett became the de facto face of men’s mental health after his second-round win over American fighter Jordan Leavitt, largely thanks to his post-fight speech about the passing of his friend.
But it rings more and more hollow with every offensive thing that comes out of the Liverpool man’s mouth.
This came as Pimblett kept insisting that Topuria “speak English”, and not “German or Spanish, like you’re from”.
Pimblett can continue to speak well about mental health, and ending the stigma, as much as he wants.
But if he doesn’t stop his deeply offensive comments about other countries and immigrants, it will always ring hollow.

     Summary: Free live streams of Paddy ‘The Baddy’ Pimblett in his latest UFC contest have been spreading online (UFC)Paddy Pimblett steps into the Octogan at UFC 282 on Saturday to face Jared Gordon, in what is arguably his toughest MMA contest to date.
As with other major fights in 2022, the high price to watch UFC 282 means many fans will likely seek illegal free live streams online.
Dozens of illegal live streaming sites have popped up in recent years, with some attracting millions of viewers for box office fights.
The prevalence of free live streams comes despite a renewed crackdown on online piracy from law enforcement in the UK, as well as warnings from cyber security experts that they pose a risk to online viewers.
Recent research from security firm Zscaler also found that a surge of live streaming sites were targeting football fans looking for ways to watch World Cup matches online for free.

There’s no way he’s in there training his balls off everyday.
I think Jared knows that, and I think he’s going to come in ready and be able to nullify that.
That’s the point that he’s at in his career, and I think he’s going to give him a good test.

     Summary: UFC superstar Paddy Pimblett has consistently maintained that he shares a love-hate relationship with social media.
On one hand, the 27-year-old's detractors have time and again criticized him for the purportedly incendiary comments he makes on social media platforms.
On that note, 'The Baddy' has now put forth an idea that he believes could help reduce hate and trolling on social media.
Speaking to TSN Sports' Aaron Bronsteter, Paddy Pimblett proposed that to use social media platforms, people should have to provide official identification (ID) or similar legal documentation.
But I'm a big advocate that [for] social media, you should have to register a card or an ID.
