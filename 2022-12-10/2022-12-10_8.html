     Summary: The 6-foot, 178-pound Senga, who features a 101 mph fastball and a biting splitter, filed for international free agency on Oct. 31, and he was recently declared an international free agent.
According to FanGraphs, Senga’s fastball has “exploding” action, but his two breaking pitches -- a cutter and a slider -- are not as effective as the fastball and splitter, particularly when it comes to missing bats.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For a few reasons, the Mets always made sense as a landing spot for Senga, 29.
Source confirms: Japanese free-agent right-hander Kodai Senga in agreement with Mets on five-year, $75M contract, pending physical.
According to The Japan Times, Senga was the first former developmental pitcher to win a Golden Glove.
On the first pitch of the encounter, Senga got Jones to ground out, but he wasn’t happy with the result.
Some scouts have skepticism because of command — Senga walked more batters than the league average for all pitchers, at 8.6 percent.

     Summary: The Mets have agreed to a five-year, $75MM deal with right-hander Kodai Senga, SNY’s Andy Martino reports (Twitter links).
The contract figure exactly matches the projection from MLBTR, as Senga ranked 11th on the list of the offseason’s Top 50 Free Agents.
There is no further posting fee involved in the Mets’ costs, since Senga became a full free agent after exercising an opt-out clause in his contract with Nippon Professional Baseball’s Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks.
The rotation now looks completely set with Max Scherzer, Verlander, Senga, Quintana, and Carlos Carrasco making up the starting five.
Speculatively, the Mets might even feel comfortable enough in their depth to shop one of their backup starters (i.e.
