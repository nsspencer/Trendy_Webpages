     Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth take down Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy in The Match
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Match was back Saturday night as Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy squared off with Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, and the viewing experience didn’t disappoint.
That’s about the only thing that went right for Woods and McIlroy early on.
Thomas tapped in for birdie at the first before rolling in a long one for birdie at the following hole.
Woods and McIlroy would win the par-5 seventh with a birdie from the No.
McIlroy did all he could by birdieing the 10th but was matched by Spieth (and Thomas was inside both) to seal the 3-and-2 victory for JT and Spieth.

     Five takeaways from The Match
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Match wasn’t close but the trash talk and antics kept things entertaining.
The best explanation came from Spieth on his match-winning approach shot from the pine straw, which he hit 5 feet from a pin tucked close to water.
“I was just trying to get on top of it and play a cut.
If you end up hitting pine straw first, it could go anywhere,” Spieth said.
Thomas joked that announcer Charles Barkley was eyeing the full moon “like it’s an Oreo.”The Thomas-Barkley banter continued as they discussed their rival alma maters.
