     Paddy Pimblett Beats Jared Gordon via Unanimous Decision in UFC 282 Co-Main Event
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLCPaddy "The Baddy" Pimblett took another step toward stardom with a unanimous decision win over Jared Gordon in the co-main event of UFC 282 from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.
Pimblett was definitely the bigger star going into the fight but Jared Gordon wasn't there to roll over.
Pimblett settled in and landed some good hooks and a few leg kicks, but Gordon continued to find his opponent's chin with regularity.
He wasn't able to mount much offense out of it but he mostly neutralized Pimblett with his clinchwork and takedowns.
With his star on the rise, he'll have to do it against bigger names than Gordon to continue his ascent.

(Photo by Carmen Mandato/Zuffa LLC)LAS VEGAS — The first 10 fights at UFC 282 all were finishes, either knockouts or submission.
The first one that wasn’t was the co-main event between Jared Gordon and Paddy Pimblett and wouldn’t you know it, the judges got it wrong.
Gordon appeared to control the fight, landing the harder shots, cracking Pimblett with several left hooks, and never really getting into trouble himself.
Pimblett was nearly a 3-1 favorite, but Gordon seemed to control the action most of the way.
