     Five takeaways from The Match
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Match wasn’t close but the trash talk and antics kept things entertaining.
The best explanation came from Spieth on his match-winning approach shot from the pine straw, which he hit 5 feet from a pin tucked close to water.
“I was just trying to get on top of it and play a cut.
If you end up hitting pine straw first, it could go anywhere,” Spieth said.
Thomas joked that announcer Charles Barkley was eyeing the full moon “like it’s an Oreo.”The Thomas-Barkley banter continued as they discussed their rival alma maters.
