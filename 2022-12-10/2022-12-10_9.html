     UFC 282: 18-year-old Raul Rosas Jr. quickly submits Jay Perrin in record-breaking debut

     Summary: Raul Rosas Jr. reacts after defeating Jay Perrin in a featherweight fight during the UFC 282 event at T-Mobile Arena on Dec. 10, 2022 in Las Vegas.
(Photo by Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC)LAS VEGAS — Raul Rosas Jr. is just 18 years old, the youngest winner in UFC history.
If he lost, he was beaten by the youngest fighter in UFC history in his promotional debut.
Jones won the light heavyweight title at 23 years in 2011.
It’s crazy to think of an 18-year-old in those terms, but there are few 18-year-olds like Raul Rosas.
