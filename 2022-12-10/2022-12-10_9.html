     Celtics' Jayson Tatum: Loss to Warriors 'not going to dictate our season'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum's struggles against the Golden State Warriors continued in Saturday night's NBA Finals rematch.
The Boston Celtics star was given a harsh reminder of last summer as the Warriors earned a 123-107 victory at Chase Center.
Tatum was limited to 18 points -- his second-lowest total of the season -- while shooting a lackluster 6-for-21 from the floor.
As great as Tatum has been all season long, the Celtics need more from the NBA MVP frontrunner in these marquee matchups.
Tatum and the Celtics will look to respond Monday when their road trip continues in Los Angeles.

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have to do anything better,‚Äù Mazzulla said of Tatum‚Äôs play.
Despite those misfires, Mazzulla was complimentary of his play.
‚ÄúI thought he was patient, I thought he tried to make the right play,‚Äù Mazzulla said.

Tatum was largely predicted to have a big game, especially with Andrew Wiggins missing from the Warriors.

The good thing, though, is he has one more chance to redeem himself when they play Golden State again in January.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Celtics 6 takeaways as Jayson Tatum, Celtics struggle in Finals rematch vs. Warriors "We never want to lose, and we‚Äôve been playing well, and to lose this one ‚Äî especially the way we played ‚Äî was tough," Tatum said.
A big Jayson Tatum game seemed likely when the Warriors announced Andrew Wiggins would be out Saturday.
In other words, the Celtics lost Saturday‚Äôs game on the offensive end and on the margins (offensive rebounding and transition).
Grant Williams was ejected from Saturday‚Äôs game for punching a basketball into the stands in the final two minutes of the game.
Of course, players would be excused if Saturday‚Äôs game meant a little more than, say, next week Friday‚Äôs showdown against the Magic.

     Warriors Trouble Jayson Tatum, Celtics Once Again in Finals Rematch

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three thoughts on the 2022 NBA Finals rematch between the Warriors and the Celtics, which saw Golden State come away with a 123‚Äì107 win over the best team in the NBA.
Tatum once again wasn‚Äôt sharp against Golden State, harkening back to his struggles in the Finals.
Cary Edmondson/USA TODAY SportsJayson Tatum struggles againIn his last seven games against the Warriors, including the 2022 Finals, Jayson Tatum is shooting 50-of-141 from the field, a ghastly 35.5%.
Tatum has been such an offensive force this season, it was rather surprising to see him continue to play so inefficiently against Golden State.
He hounds Tatum better than anyone.)
