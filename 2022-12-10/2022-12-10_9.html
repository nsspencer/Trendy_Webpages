     Boxing results, highlights: Terence Crawford scores brutal knockout; Teofimo Lopez gets questionable win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Both Terence Crawford and Teofimo Lopez picked up wins, but wins of a very different nature.
Prior to the knockout, Avanesyan gave Crawford some trouble, constantly applying pressure and forcing Crawford to stay busy off the jab to try and maintain some sort of distance.
At the same time Crawford was putting Avanesyan to sleep, Lopez was sweating out a split decision win over Sandor Martin in New York City.
Lopez was dropped in the second round when Martin countered a lunging punch with a grazing step-back right hand.
Martin continued to fight a disciplined fight throughout, routinely landing right hands as Lopez threw wild shots.

     Summary: Every time David Avanesyan found success pressuring, Terence Crawford responded accordingly.

     Terence Crawford Beats David Avanesyan via 6th-Round Knockout to Retain Title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He tried to take the fight to Crawford in the early going, staying in his face and throwing power punches that were mostly avoided by Crawford.
With the win, Crawford retains his WBO welterweight title that he's held since a ninth-round TKO stoppage against Jeff Horn in 2018.
The good news for fight fans is that Crawford doesn't seem to have lost hope in putting together a fight with Spence.
"We both need this fight," Crawford said, per Morgan Campbell of the New York Times.
"The top two fighters in our division that's undefeated, that's in our prime.

     Summary: In front of a raucous hometown crowd, Crawford floored David Avanesyan with a sixth-round TKO on Saturday at the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska.
A left uppercut followed by a textbook right put Avanesyan on his back, quickly prompting the end of a tricky fight for Crawford.
Crawford (39-0, 30 KOs) started slowly against Avanesyan (29-4-1, 17 KOs).
Once Crawford started leading with his right hand, he settled into the fight.
In the fifth round, Crawford increased his punching output and leaned on a series of uppercuts with Avanesyan on the inside.

     Terence Crawford Knocks David Avanesyan Out Cold in Sixth Round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A spin move by Crawford left Avanesyan out of position to counter, instead throwing up a high guard to defend against an incoming right hook to the body.
Avanesyan snuck in a left hand and chopping right right at the bell in response to a right uppercut from Crawford moments before that sequence.
Crawford was dialed in with his right uppercut as well as his right hook both to the body and head.
He previously held the WBA ‘Regular’ welterweight title but never previously received a shot at a primary titleholder.
Crawford improved to 39-0 (30KOs) as he made the sixth defense of his WBO welterweight title.
