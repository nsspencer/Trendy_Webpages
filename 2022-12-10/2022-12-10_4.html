     Raul Rosas Jr. wins by submission as UFC's youngest fighter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Raul Rosas Jr., who turned 18 years old just two months ago, became the youngest fighter ever to compete in the UFC on Saturday night, and his performance was dominant in a first-round submission of veteran bantamweight Jay Perrin during the prelims of UFC 282 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.
Rosas, who was born in Mexico and raised in New Mexico and California, was signed off of Dana White's Contender Series when he was still 17.
He now is 18 years and 63 days old, younger than the only other 18-year-olds to compete in the Octagon, Sean Daugherty and Dan Lauzon.
But Rosas is the first 18-year-old to win in the UFC.
And right now, tonight, I just came to introduce myself, because I'm coming for that belt."
