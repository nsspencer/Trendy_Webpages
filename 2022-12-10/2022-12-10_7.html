     Three Takeaways From Bruins’ Last-Second Loss To Coyotes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Bruins lost in heartbreaking fashion Friday night when a non-icing call led Lawson Crouse to bury the game-winner with 14 seconds left and give the Arizona Coyotes the 4-3 win over Boston.
His second goal of the game wins it for the @ArizonaCoyotes with 13.5 seconds remaining!!
It wasn’t just the non-call that led to the Bruins’ loss, though.
Jeremy Swayman put his hand up as if the icing call was going to come, but it never did.
No one on the Bruins played the puck and the Coyotes jumped all over the opportunity.

     Summary: The Bruins fumbled the puck when an icing call was waived off at the last instant.
Forbort then over-skated the puck, Matias Maccelli pounced on it and fed Crouse out front for the winning goal.
“I was shocked,” said Nick Foligno, who had scored a late tying goal.

     Talking Points: Strange Ending Sinks Boston Bruins In Arizona
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here are the Talking Points for the Boston Bruins 4-3 loss to the Arizona Coyotes at the very “intimate” Mullett Arena on Friday night before an announced crowd of 4.600 fans.
GOLD STAR: Arizona Coyotes netminder Karel Vejmelka was the difference-maker in a game where the Boston Bruins outshot the Coyotes by 46-16 margin over the course of the game.
It was a weird ending, but also appropriate for a Boston Bruins team that didn’t really play well enough to win.
It was a strange end to an odd game for the Boston Bruins, but what do you expect with two NHL teams playing at a college arena that seats 5,000 people?
The only thing that should wave it off is if the D-man can touch the puck before it crosses over [the goal line].” –Boston Bruins head coach Jim Montgomery.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the puck trickled toward the Bruins' net, it clanked off the side of the cage, leading to the linesman waving off an icing call.
Foligno, whose power-play tally with 5:29 remaining tied the score at 3, said that he "was shocked" that no icing was called on the play.
Not to knock those [officials], it's a just a surprising call when 100 times out of 100 that's an icing.
I think we've got to own it and be better next game."
"I think we always feel like we're confident when we're playing that well, good things are gonna happen for our club.

But Arizona Coyotes Karel Vejlmeka prevented any plans of the Bruins briefly celebrating another two points amid their historic start.
Between Veijlmeka’s outstanding 43-save performance and the game-ending non-icing sequence, the Bruins couldn’t overcome the lowly Coyotes.

     RECAP: Bruins lose their first game to the Coyotes since 2010
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In spite of all the work put into it, the Bruins couldn’t take the lead, and onto the 2nd we go.
But, like all things in this game, we couldn’t have entirely nice things, as Lawson Crouse got his first goal of the game off a tip from Chychrun’s blast from the point.
And then...Coyotes Win 4-3 over the Bruins for the first time since 2010, and first time in the continental US since 2009.
Let’s unpack the very loaded and quite unhappy topic of Jeremy Swayman’s recent play.
The Bruins are travelling today, and will get their rematch against the Vegas Golden Knights on Sunday evening.
