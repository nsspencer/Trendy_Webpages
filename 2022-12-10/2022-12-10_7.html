     Devin Booker questionable for Suns vs. Pelicans with hamstring tightness
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phoenix Suns All-Star Devin Booker has been listed as questionable on the team’s injury report for Sunday’s game against the Pelicans in New Orleans.
Head coach Monty Williams said on Saturday that the is dealing with hamstring tightness and is considered day-to-day, according to azcentral’s Duane Rankin.
Booker scored 14 points in 36 minutes during Phoenix’s 128-117 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night.
Williams removed Booker from the game with 1:50 to go and the Suns trailing by eight points, something the head coach never does unless something is wrong.
Booker is slumping lately, shooting just 15-of-47 (31.9%) in his last three games after winning Western Conference Player of the Month for November.

     Summary: Devin Booker is on the injury report for Sunday's game between the Phoenix Suns and New Orleans Pelicans.
On Sunday afternoon, the Phoenix Suns will be in Louisiana to take on the New Orleans Pelicans for the second straight game.

2021 All-Star Zion Williamson led the way for the Pelicans with 35 points, seven rebounds, four assists and one steal.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Suns hate the fact that Zion Williamson threw down an acrobatic dunk in the dying seconds on Friday when the game was already over.
“Get back on defense.”One major subplot to watch here is Jose Alvarado versus Chris Paul.

And remember, Friday’s matchup didn’t even feature Herb Jones, who also can’t stand Paul and the Suns.
The Suns and Pelicans may very well meet again in the playoffs, and not just in the first round either.

     Zion Williamson’s showboat dunk at end of Pelicans’ win angers Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zion Williamson apologized for his 360-degree, one-handed slam dunk that angered the Phoenix Suns at the end of a game the New Orleans Pelicans had all but won.
The dunk contest-style jam capped a season-high 35-point performance for Williamson, and the Pelicans beat the Suns 128-117 on Friday night in a matchup of the top two teams in the Western Conference.
“But I was in that locker room when my brothers were down because the Suns sent us home [from the playoffs] last year.
CJ McCollum had 18 points for the Pelicans, who have won six straight and 11 of 13, and afterward questioned the Suns’ reaction to Williamson’s dunk.
“They got to get back on defense if they don’t want us to dunk the ball,” McCollum said.

     In Friday win over Suns, Pelicans provided plenty more reasons for excitement to build about team's present, future
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Perhaps a similar message should apply to the New Orleans fan base, and even local media members as well: Walk away.
Don’t waste energy and focus on the final 2 seconds of Friday’s matchup between elite Western Conference teams and whatever that was.
Instead, run headfirst to the previous 47:58 of action, when the Pelicans provided a laundry list of reasons for 16,000-plus attendees to be thoroughly entertained, capped by Williamson’s 360 slam.
Reasons why New Orleans (17-8, tops in the West after a 128-117 victory) once again demonstrated that the future of the franchise – and increasingly, the present as well – is so bright.
The Pelicans are 11-3 overall at home this season (only Boston, Cleveland, Golden State and Memphis have fewer home defeats).

     Monty Williams reveals Devin Booker injury after heated Pelicans loss

     Summary: By Jack Winter · 2 min readOne of basketball’s newest and most heated rivalries is due another installment after Zion Williamson helped heighten existing tension between the New Orleans Pelicans and Phoenix Suns on Friday.
Too bad Devin Booker could be primed to miss Sunday’s matchup between these contentious Western Conference powers.
“We’re just going to see how he progresses,” Phoenix’s head coach said of Booker’s hamstring, per Duane Rankin of Arizona Republic.

If Booker can’t go, though, drama and intrigue surrounding another battle between the Suns and Pelicans will be relatively muted, and rightfully so.

    </h2>

     Summary: The Pelicans got some revenge, winning 128-117 in an atmosphere that felt more like a playoff game than just a regular-season game in December.
Some of the Suns’ players weren’t pleased with the dunk because the game had already been decided.
Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado and Chris Paul appeared to exchange words after the buzzer sounded, sparking the fuse to the tension.
Coaching staffs from both teams, including Pelicans head coach Willie Green and Suns associate head coach Kevin Young, had to be separated.
“We hate that they beat us on our home floor to lose a playoff game.

He could dribble the ball out, but instead chucks it ahead to Larry Nance Jr. for an uncontested layup.

Yet there was one massive difference that separated these teams on Friday night: Zion Williamson.
