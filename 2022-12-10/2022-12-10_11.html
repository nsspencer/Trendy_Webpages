    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jayson Tatum struggled against the Golden State Warriors in the 2022 NBA Finals, and it was one of the reasons why the Boston Celtics lost that series.
Jayson Tatum looked spooked (Saturday night), and he talked about losing sleep after the Finals, he's definitely about to lose sleep until he plays Golden State again.
No matter what he does from here, until they play Golden State again in Boston, they're going to keep saying, 'Oh, he isn't ready for Golden State'.
He scored 13 points on 6-of-18 shooting in Game 6 of the series when Golden State clinched the championship in Boston.
But there's no question Tatum needs to find ways to be more impactful at both ends of the floor against the Warriors.

     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa · 2 min readBoston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is on the receiving end of several criticisms after his rather uncharacteristic performance on Saturday in the rematch of the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors.
Tatum was largely predicted to have a big game, especially with Andrew Wiggins missing from the Warriors.

The good thing, though, is he has one more chance to redeem himself when they play Golden State again in January.

Part of that mission is a little revenge on Saturday night, taking on the team that beat them in the Finals last season, the Warriors.
While we’re having fun and happy the way we plan, nobody in that locker room is celebrating, satisfied where we’re at.
None of this means anything if we don’t hang a banner.
Tatum and company know that’s nice, but it’s not the end goal.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — The lights and stakes don’t get much higher for a regular season game in December than it did Saturday.
The Celtics and Warriors met for the first time since last season’s NBA Finals, putting a spotlight on the marquee matchup.
The Celtics looked uncomfortable as their leader, Jayson Tatum, had one of the worst games of his young season.
Yet, even after such a tough loss, Tatum was far from overreacting to a long season.
It’s frustrating to lose, Tatum said, but there are still plenty of games left in the season to flip the page.

Tatum had another rough go of it against the Warriors in Saturday’s 123-107 loss at Chase Center, shooting just 6-for-21 from the field and finishing with 18 points.
I have to be better,” Mazzulla told reporters, as seen on NBC Sports Boston postgame coverage.
“I just got to be better,” Tatum told reporters, as seen on NBC Sports Boston postgame coverage.
His mindset of looking to what next helps him do just that as Tatum will look to bounce back Monday against the Los Angeles Clippers.

     Summary: Three thoughts on the 2022 NBA Finals rematch between the Warriors and the Celtics, which saw Golden State come away with a 123–107 win over the best team in the NBA.
Tatum once again wasn’t sharp against Golden State, harkening back to his struggles in the Finals.
Cary Edmondson/USA TODAY SportsJayson Tatum struggles againIn his last seven games against the Warriors, including the 2022 Finals, Jayson Tatum is shooting 50-of-141 from the field, a ghastly 35.5%.
Tatum has been such an offensive force this season, it was rather surprising to see him continue to play so inefficiently against Golden State.
He hounds Tatum better than anyone.)
