     Terence Crawford Beats David Avanesyan via 6th-Round Knockout to Retain Title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He tried to take the fight to Crawford in the early going, staying in his face and throwing power punches that were mostly avoided by Crawford.
With the win, Crawford retains his WBO welterweight title that he's held since a ninth-round TKO stoppage against Jeff Horn in 2018.
The good news for fight fans is that Crawford doesn't seem to have lost hope in putting together a fight with Spence.
"We both need this fight," Crawford said, per Morgan Campbell of the New York Times.
"The top two fighters in our division that's undefeated, that's in our prime.
