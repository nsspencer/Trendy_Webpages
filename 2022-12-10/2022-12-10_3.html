     Summary: USC quarterback Caleb Williams won the 2022 Heisman Trophy on Saturday night, earning college football's most treasured individual honor in his first year with the Trojans.
Stroud, TCU's Max Duggan and Georgia's Stetson Bennett -- in what was the first all-quarterback group of Heisman finalists since 2018.
Duggan finished second in the voting, receiving 1,420 points to Williams' 2,031.
The Trojans attacked the transfer portal hard last offseason, landing Williams, former Pitt wide receiver Jordan Addison, former Oregon running back Travis Dye, former Colorado wide receiver Brenden Rice (Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice's son) and former Oklahoma wide receiver Mario Williams, among others.
He could enter next season as the Heisman favorite again and have the Trojans in a position to build on a successful 2022 campaign.

     2022 Heisman Trophy winner: USC QB Caleb Williams claims award giving Trojans most Heismans in history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: USC quarterback Caleb Williams has won the 2022 Heisman Trophy after a standout sophomore season under first-year coach Lincoln Riley, who has now coached three Heisman winners over his six seasons as a head coach, all of whom were transfers.
Williams passed for 4,075 yards, 37 touchdowns and just four interceptions while completing 66.1% of his passes this season.
Williams beating all three for college football's most prestigious individual award demonstrates his importance to USC's success this season.
Like 2021 Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young of Alabama, Williams is expected to play another season of college football as he will not be eligible for the NFL Draft until after his junior season.
