     Summary: By Angelo Guinhawa · 2 min readBoston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is on the receiving end of several criticisms after his rather uncharacteristic performance on Saturday in the rematch of the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors.
Tatum was largely predicted to have a big game, especially with Andrew Wiggins missing from the Warriors.

The good thing, though, is he has one more chance to redeem himself when they play Golden State again in January.

     Why Celtics’ Jayson Tatum downplayed Warriors loss in NBA Finals rematch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — The lights and stakes don’t get much higher for a regular season game in December than it did Saturday.
The Celtics and Warriors met for the first time since last season’s NBA Finals, putting a spotlight on the marquee matchup.
The Celtics looked uncomfortable as their leader, Jayson Tatum, had one of the worst games of his young season.
Yet, even after such a tough loss, Tatum was far from overreacting to a long season.
It’s frustrating to lose, Tatum said, but there are still plenty of games left in the season to flip the page.

Tatum had another rough go of it against the Warriors in Saturday’s 123-107 loss at Chase Center, shooting just 6-for-21 from the field and finishing with 18 points.
I have to be better,” Mazzulla told reporters, as seen on NBC Sports Boston postgame coverage.

His mindset of looking to what next helps him do just that as Tatum will look to bounce back Monday against the Los Angeles Clippers.

     Summary: Three thoughts on the 2022 NBA Finals rematch between the Warriors and the Celtics, which saw Golden State come away with a 123–107 win over the best team in the NBA.
Tatum once again wasn’t sharp against Golden State, harkening back to his struggles in the Finals.
Cary Edmondson/USA TODAY SportsJayson Tatum struggles againIn his last seven games against the Warriors, including the 2022 Finals, Jayson Tatum is shooting 50-of-141 from the field, a ghastly 35.5%.
Tatum has been such an offensive force this season, it was rather surprising to see him continue to play so inefficiently against Golden State.
He hounds Tatum better than anyone.)

     Celtics' Jayson Tatum: Loss to Warriors 'not going to dictate our season'
    </h2>

     Summary: Jayson Tatum: Loss to Warriors 'not going to dictate our season' originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonJayson Tatum's struggles against the Golden State Warriors continued in Saturday night's NBA Finals rematch.
The Boston Celtics star was given a harsh reminder of last summer as the Warriors earned a 123-107 victory at Chase Center.
Tatum was limited to 18 points -- his second-lowest total of the season -- while shooting a lackluster 6-for-21 from the floor.
As great as Tatum has been all season long, the Celtics need more from the NBA MVP frontrunner in these marquee matchups.
Tatum and the Celtics will look to respond Monday when their road trip continues in Los Angeles.
