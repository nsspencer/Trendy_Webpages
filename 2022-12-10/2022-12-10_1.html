     Paddy Pimblett Beats Jared Gordon via Unanimous Decision in UFC 282 Co-Main Event
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLCPaddy "The Baddy" Pimblett took another step toward stardom with a unanimous decision win over Jared Gordon in the co-main event of UFC 282 from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.
Pimblett was definitely the bigger star going into the fight but Jared Gordon wasn't there to roll over.
Pimblett settled in and landed some good hooks and a few leg kicks, but Gordon continued to find his opponent's chin with regularity.
He wasn't able to mount much offense out of it but he mostly neutralized Pimblett with his clinchwork and takedowns.
With his star on the rise, he'll have to do it against bigger names than Gordon to continue his ascent.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pimblett edged out a tough decision win against experienced Octagon veteran Jared Gordon in the co-main event of UFC 282 on Saturday in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Pimblett has a tendency to keep his chin high and Gordon made him pay for it early and often.
Pimblett landed slightly more significant and total strikes in what was a toss-up.
Gordon held Pimblett against the cage for the majority of the round, but he landed barely any strikes of substance.
The strike count was low on both ends, but Pimblett landed a handful of solid elbows and knees with his back to the fence.

     UFC 282 results: Paddy Pimblett wins controversial decision over Jared Gordon to remain undefeated in UFC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paddy Pimblett is still undefeated in the UFC but his victory at UFC 282 came with a controversial decision over Jared Gordon.
The calf kicks from Pimblett were paying dividends but Gordon was quick to fire back with well-timed punches that were consistently doing damage.
Gordon started to get more aggressive, closing the distance and then unloading punches in succession once he had Pimblett in range.
With a back-and-forth battle through 10 minutes, Gordon opened the final frame with a takedown attempt while pressuring Pimblett against the cage.
Both fighters raised their hands in victory afterwards but only Pimblett will leave with a win on his resume.

Just as Pimblett started to connect with his hands, he accidentally poked Gordon and caused a pause to the action.
Gordon went right back to the clinch, though, pressing Paddy against the cage.

     Paddy Pimblett’s mental health gimmick becoming more and more hollow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paddy Pimblett became the de facto face of men’s mental health after his second-round win over American fighter Jordan Leavitt, largely thanks to his post-fight speech about the passing of his friend.
But it rings more and more hollow with every offensive thing that comes out of the Liverpool man’s mouth.
This came as Pimblett kept insisting that Topuria “speak English”, and not “German or Spanish, like you’re from”.
Pimblett can continue to speak well about mental health, and ending the stigma, as much as he wants.
But if he doesn’t stop his deeply offensive comments about other countries and immigrants, it will always ring hollow.

(Photo by Carmen Mandato/Zuffa LLC)LAS VEGAS — The first 10 fights at UFC 282 all were finishes, either knockouts or submission.
The first one that wasn’t was the co-main event between Jared Gordon and Paddy Pimblett and wouldn’t you know it, the judges got it wrong.
Gordon appeared to control the fight, landing the harder shots, cracking Pimblett with several left hooks, and never really getting into trouble himself.
Pimblett was nearly a 3-1 favorite, but Gordon seemed to control the action most of the way.
