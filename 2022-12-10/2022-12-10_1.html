     UFC 282 live blog: Paddy Pimblett vs. Jared Gordon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is the UFC 282 live blog for Paddy Pimblett vs. Jared Gordon, the lightweight co-main event on Saturday in Las Vegas.
Despite this being only his fourth fight in the UFC, Pimblett has already established himself as one of the biggest stars in all of MMA.
The former Cage Warriors featherweight champion has made a name for himself on the back of his exciting fighting style and unique personality, and though he’s 3-0 inside the UFC, Jared Gordon represents a notable step up in competition for “The Baddy.”A UFC fighter since 2017, Gordon has spent most of his time in the promotion at lightweight, where he’s proven to be an incredibly difficult out for anyone.
With a 7-4 record in the UFC, Gordon’s losses have come against some of the very best lightweights in the world, and on Saturday, “Flash” hopes to prove that Pimblett is not in that class of fighter.

     Paddy Pimblett Beats Jared Gordon via Unanimous Decision in UFC 282 Co-Main Event
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLCPaddy "The Baddy" Pimblett took another step toward stardom with a unanimous decision win over Jared Gordon in the co-main event of UFC 282 from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.
Pimblett was definitely the bigger star going into the fight but Jared Gordon wasn't there to roll over.
Pimblett settled in and landed some good hooks and a few leg kicks, but Gordon continued to find his opponent's chin with regularity.
He wasn't able to mount much offense out of it but he mostly neutralized Pimblett with his clinchwork and takedowns.
With his star on the rise, he'll have to do it against bigger names than Gordon to continue his ascent.

     Summary: Paddy Pimblett of England reacts between rounds against Jared Gordon in a lightweight fight during the UFC 282 event at T-Mobile Arena on Dec. 10, 2022 in Las Vegas.
(Photo by Carmen Mandato/Zuffa LLC)LAS VEGAS — The first 10 fights at UFC 282 all were finishes, either knockouts or submission.
The first one that wasn’t was the co-main event between Jared Gordon and Paddy Pimblett and wouldn’t you know it, the judges got it wrong.
Gordon appeared to control the fight, landing the harder shots, cracking Pimblett with several left hooks, and never really getting into trouble himself.
Pimblett was nearly a 3-1 favorite, but Gordon seemed to control the action most of the way.
