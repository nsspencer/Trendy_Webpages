    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: USC quarterback Caleb Williams won the 2022 Heisman Trophy on Saturday night, earning college football's most treasured individual honor in his first year with the Trojans.
Stroud, TCU's Max Duggan and Georgia's Stetson Bennett -- in what was the first all-quarterback group of Heisman finalists since 2018.
Duggan finished second in the voting, receiving 1,420 points to Williams' 2,031.
The Trojans attacked the transfer portal hard last offseason, landing Williams, former Pitt wide receiver Jordan Addison, former Oregon running back Travis Dye, former Colorado wide receiver Brenden Rice (Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice's son) and former Oklahoma wide receiver Mario Williams, among others.
He could enter next season as the Heisman favorite again and have the Trojans in a position to build on a successful 2022 campaign.
