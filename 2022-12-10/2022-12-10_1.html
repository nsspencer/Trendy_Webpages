    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: France will take on Morocco in the semi final of the World Cup after the European side beat England 1-2 at the Al Bayt stadium.
Morocco, given the side of the bracket they have come from in the tournament draw, will be the ‘away’ side, with France the ‘home’ team.
The semi final will be played on 14 December at the Al Bayt stadium at 11 a.m. PT / 2 p.m.
How to watch the semi final between France and Morocco?
However, France have so much firepower together with a strong defence and should be too much for the African side to make their way to the final.
