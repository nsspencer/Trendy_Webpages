     Paddy Pimblett Wins at UFC 282, but His Hype Train Just Took a Huge Hit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLCThe Paddy Pimblett hype train is still on the rails, but its pace has slowed to a crawl.
It was viewed as the toughest test of the Brit's career after stoppage wins in his first three UFC bouts.
And while he ultimately passed it with a unanimous-decision victory, the context of that result is impossible to ignore.
From an early vantage point, this fight looked like a layup for Pimblett.
An impressive stoppage win over a veteran like Gordon would have done a lot to dispel those doubts.

     Summary: Paddy Pimblett of England reacts between rounds against Jared Gordon in a lightweight fight during the UFC 282 event at T-Mobile Arena on Dec. 10, 2022 in Las Vegas.
(Photo by Carmen Mandato/Zuffa LLC)LAS VEGAS — The first 10 fights at UFC 282 all were finishes, either knockouts or submission.
The first one that wasn’t was the co-main event between Jared Gordon and Paddy Pimblett and wouldn’t you know it, the judges got it wrong.
Gordon appeared to control the fight, landing the harder shots, cracking Pimblett with several left hooks, and never really getting into trouble himself.
Pimblett was nearly a 3-1 favorite, but Gordon seemed to control the action most of the way.
