He’d be like, ‘You’ve got to get a hit here to win the World Series.’ I’d stay up late watching those postseason games.

     Yankees trade for new catcher from Texas Rangers, supplementing injury to position
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Yankees desperately needed catching support with newly acquired backstop Ben Rortvedt from the Minnesota Twins dealing with an oblique injury that will keep him out beyond opening day.
Higashioka is hitting .478 with seven homers and 11 RBIs over 23 at-bats.
To make matters even better for the Yankees, Higashioka is a phenomenal defensive catcher who is preferred by the majority of Yankee pitchers.
Cashman recognized that the team needed experience at the catcher position, trading for Texas Rangers catcher Jose Trevino.
At 29 years old, Trevino played in 89 games last year, posting a .239 batting average with five homers and 30 RBIs.

     Yankees trade for Rangers’ catcher Jose Trevino
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sign up for our amNY Sports email newsletter to get insights and game coverage for your favorite teamsThe Yankees have added depth at the catcher position with the acquisition of Jose Trevino from the Texas Rangers — adding yet another strong defender to the roster in the Bronx.
That gave the team incentive to trade for Trevino, who posted a .991 fielding percentage in 88 appearances last season.
The Bronx Bombers gave up two pitching prospects for Trevino — Albert Abreu and Robert Ahlstrom.
The lefty Ahlstrom, meanwhile, was selected in the 2021 MLB Draft, and has yet to take the mound in the big leagues.
Now, the team will hope Higashioka can make a bigger impact behind the plate, and have secured Trevino as a solid defensive backup should their opening day-starter miss any time.

     Yankees trade for Jose Trevino, and MLB scout loves this catching upgrade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: What this trade for Jose Trevino does is add a quality backup who will be an upgrade over the healthy No.
2 options that the Yankees had been considering, an MLB scout told NJ Advance Media an hour after the deal with the Texas Rangers went down.
The scout considers Trevino an above-average defensive catcher who can handle the bat a little minus the kind of power we’ve seen from Higashioka, who leads the majors with seven spring homers.
“I’ll tell you what, Trevino is a good backup because he can call a good game,” the scout said.
No … come on!”This trade assures Higashioka will be the Yankees’ regular, and he’s earned in it a big way.

     Yankees excited to have ‘premium defensive catcher’ in Jose Trevino
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DUNEDIN, Fla. — The Yankees finally have their catching situation set for the beginning of the regular season.
“Especially with Ben being down for a little bit, to be able to get a premium defensive catcher, we’re really excited about that.
“Higgy, Ben and Trevino, I feel like we got three premium defensive catchers on our 40-man roster,” Boone said.
Before the trade, the Yankees were facing the prospect of choosing from Rob Brantly, David Freitas and Max McDowell to be their backup catcher, though none were on the 40-man roster.
With the trade, the Yankees’ ex-Ranger contingent grew again, with Trevino joining Joey Gallo and Isiah Kiner-Falefa in The Bronx.
