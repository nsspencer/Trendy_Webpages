     Tottenham thrashes Newcastle 5-1 to rise to 4th in EPL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APLONDON (AP) — Tottenham powered above north London rival Arsenal into the English Premier League top four — for at least one day — by thrashing Newcastle 5-1 on Sunday.
Newcastle took the lead through Fabian Schar's free kick in the 39th minute but couldn't handle the relentless attacks of Tottenham.
Tottenham moved into fourth place on goal difference ahead of Arsenal, which has two games in hand — the first coming at Crystal Palace on Monday.
Tottenham and Arsenal are five points behind third-placed Chelsea.
Royal scored his first goal for Tottenham by poking in Doherty's cross in the 63rd, and Bergwijn raced through the middle of Newcastle's defense to score the fifth in the 83rd.
