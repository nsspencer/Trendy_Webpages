     EXCLUSIVE U.S. Vice President Harris' deputy chief of staff to depart
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's deputy chief of staff Michael Fuchs is leaving the administration, the latest top aide from her office to announce a departure, according to an internal staff memo seen by Reuters.
Fuchs' announcement follows a series of exits from Harris's team.
The White House said she will be succeeded by her deputy, Philip Gordon.
Staff shake-ups after the first year of any presidential administration are not unusual, and other areas of the White House are experiencing turnover.
"This period before the midterms is a common time for officials to depart," said a White House official, who did not wish to be named.

     Kamala Harris’ deputy chief of staff will leave White House in latest shakeup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michael Fuchs, the former Clinton and Obama administration foreign policy adviser who has served as Vice President Kamala Harris’ deputy chief of staff since she took office, will depart the White House next month.
In an internal memorandum obtained by Reuters, Mr Fuchs wrote that he will remain on the job until May to “ensure a smooth transition” to his successor.
It’s not unusual for White House senior staff to decamp for other roles at this point in any administration, though President Joe Biden has seen very few departures at either the senior staff or cabinet level so far.
But Ms Harris’ tenure as vice president has been marked by a number of high-profile staff exits, some far earlier than would otherwise be expected.
Last year, her chief spokesperson and senior adviser Symone Sanders left the administration for a job with MSNBC, and communications director Ashley Etienne left soon after.

     Summary: U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said: "Gas prices are high due to gas prices not being low as before.
