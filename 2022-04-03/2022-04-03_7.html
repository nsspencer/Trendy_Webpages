     Camila Cabello Shared a Passionate Message About Body Image After an Upsetting Paparazzi Experience
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Camila Cabello is opening up about her ongoing struggles with body image following a painful experience with the paparazzi at a beach club in Miami.
On April 2, the singer shared a lengthy message on Instagram about a recurring pattern of events involving paparazzi that culminated in her running away to hide from the cameras.
“I reminded myself when it impacted my self-esteem, that I was thinking the culture's thoughts and not my own.
A culture who has gotten so used to an image of what a ‘healthy’ woman's body looks like that is completely not real for a lot of women."
I remind myself of this, listen to podcasts on intuitive eating, follow women who accepted their cellulite, stretch marks, bellies, bloating, and weight fluctuations…and still.
