     Former Ohio State Head Coach Thad Matta Hired To Replace LaVall Jordan At Butler
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Five years after his final season at Ohio State, Thad Matta will become a head coach once again.
Butler announced Sunday that it has hired Matta, who took the Bulldogs to the NCAA Tournament in a one-year stint as the program's head coach in 2000-01, to rejoin his alma mater in replacing LaVall Jordan as its new head coach this offseason.
Matta captured five regular season conference crowns and four conference tournament titles with the Buckeyes, made two Final Fours and competed in one national championship game.
Matta has the most all-time wins in program history, and his nine NCAA Tournament berths are also the most ever among Ohio State head coaches.
After missing the NCAA Tournament for two consecutive seasons, though, Ohio State parted ways with Matta in June 2017, with then-Butler head coach Chris Holtmann taking the open head coaching vacancy in Columbus.

     Thad Matta takes the head coach position at Butler
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After spending the 2021-22 season as the Associate Athletic Director for Basketball Administration at Indiana working under AD Scott Dolson, Matta was named Sunday as the new head coach at Butler.
The new position will mark a return trip to Butler for Matta.
In his 17 years as a college head coach, which includes stints at Butler, Ohio State and Xavier, Matta possesses a record of 439-154 (.740).
Matta was speculated to be a candidate for the IU head coaching position last year, and other positions in college basketball since he left Ohio State.
Now Woodson will compete with Matta on the recruiting trail for top talent in the Midwest, something that was a strength of the new Butler head coach prior to his health issues.
