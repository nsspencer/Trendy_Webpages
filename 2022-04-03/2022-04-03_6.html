    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thad Matta is back in coaching -- and back at Butler.
The Bulldogs announced Sunday they were hiring Matta as their next head coach.
I have seen that personally in Thad as a player, assistant coach and head coach.
Matta, 54, hasn't coached in college since 2017, when he stepped down as Ohio State's head coach.
Matta's career record is 439-154 overall, with a 337-123 record at Ohio State.

     Thad Matta takes the head coach position at Butler
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After spending the 2021-22 season as the Associate Athletic Director for Basketball Administration at Indiana working under AD Scott Dolson, Matta was named Sunday as the new head coach at Butler.
The new position will mark a return trip to Butler for Matta.
In his 17 years as a college head coach, which includes stints at Butler, Ohio State and Xavier, Matta possesses a record of 439-154 (.740).
Matta was speculated to be a candidate for the IU head coaching position last year, and other positions in college basketball since he left Ohio State.
Now Woodson will compete with Matta on the recruiting trail for top talent in the Midwest, something that was a strength of the new Butler head coach prior to his health issues.

     Thad Matta returning to Butler for 2nd stint as head coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Thad Matta is returning to Butler, hired on Sunday to coach the Bulldogs almost five years after he cited his health while stepping down at Ohio State.
The 54-year-old Matta led Butler to a 24-8 record and an appearance in the 2001 NCAA Tournament during his only season as the head coach at his alma mater.
“I’m grateful for the opportunity to return to Butler and lead our men’s basketball program,” Matta said in a release.
Butler played in the 2018 NCAA Tournament and was expected to make it back in 2020 before the tournament was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
After coaching Butler for the 2000-2001 season, Matta went 78-23 with three NCAA Tournament appearances in three seasons at Xavier.
