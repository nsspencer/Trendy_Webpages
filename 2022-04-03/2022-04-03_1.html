     At Least 6 Dead and 12 Wounded in Shooting in Sacramento, Police Say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SACRAMENTO — At least six people were killed and 12 wounded in downtown Sacramento early Sunday, the authorities said, after gunfire erupted outside a strip of crowded bars where nightlife had recently rebounded as the coronavirus pandemic ebbed.
The shooting, a block from the Capitol building, happened shortly after 2 a.m., as clubs closed in an area that had been packed in the aftermath of a nearly sold-out rap show.
Earlier that night Tyler, the Creator had performed at the nearby Golden 1 Center.
Chief Lester asked the public to contact the department with any information about the shooting.
She said that it was unclear how many people had opened fire, and that no one was in custody.

     Sacramento shooting leaves six people dead and nine injured, police say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Police in Sacramento, California, are hunting for one or more suspects after six people were killed and ten others injured after a shooting in the city’s downtown.
The national gun violence epidemic has hit our community – again,” said local council member Katie Valenzuela.
The shootings in Sacramento happened as another incident occurred in Dallas, Texas, where one person was killed and 10 others injured during a shooting at an outdoor concert on Saturday night.
Last month a man in Sacramento shot dead his three daughters and another person at a church in the city.
The latest shootings also come after last month two people were killed and two injured in a shooting on a public bus in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
