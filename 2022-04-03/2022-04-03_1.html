     Osaka Loses a Final in Miami, but Sees New Hope After Reaching It
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — A little more than two years ago, over dinner during the Australian Open, Iga Swiatek told Naomi Osaka that she wasn’t sure a career in tennis was going to go her way, so she was thinking of going to college.
Osaka, who was 22 then and had already won two Grand Slam titles, told Swiatek that was a terrible idea.
You’re really good, Osaka told Swiatek, who at the time was still cramming in high school homework.
Don’t divert your energy to college just yet, Osaka advised.
Nine months later she came out of nowhere to win the French Open while she was ranked 54th in the world.

     New No. 1 Iga Swiatek defeats Naomi Osaka for Miami Open title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 ranking in fitting fashion, defeating Naomi Osaka 6-4, 6-0 to win the women’s title at the Miami Open tennis tournament to extend her winning streak to 17 matches.
1 in the women’s rankings when the points are updated Monday, also completed the so-called Sunshine Double — winning both Indian Wells and Miami.
Break, hold, break, hold, break, hold as Swiatek finished off her ninth consecutive straight-sets victory.
Osaka has openly talked about struggling with depression and working on her mental health since winning the 2018 U.S. Open over Serena Williams.
The gap between 1 and 2 in that scenario would have been much closer — Barty led Swiatek by 2,204 points when the Miami Open began and would have seen that margin sliced down to 269 points on Monday.
