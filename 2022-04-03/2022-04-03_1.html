     'They killed my sister': Chaos in the streets as at least 6 die, 10 are hurt in Sacramento shooting rampage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A shooting rampage in downtown Sacramento early Sunday left six people dead, at least 10 wounded and fueled an intensive manhunt for the killer or killers.
Police initially reported "multiple victims" after the attack as they waded through the carnage counting casualties near the State Capitol.
Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, in a series of tweets, called gun violence "the scourge of our city, state and nation."
He said Lester, who began the job two weeks ago, has made gun violence a top priority.
The shooting comes a month after five people were killed when a man opened fire at a Sacramento church and killed his three children, then fatally shot himself, authorities said.

     Sacramento shooting leaves six people dead and nine injured, police say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Police in Sacramento, California, are hunting for one or more suspects after six people were killed and at least nine others injured after a shooting in the city’s downtown.
Sacramento police chief Kathy Lester said at a news conference that police were patrolling the area at about 2am after hearing gunfire.
The national gun violence epidemic has hit our community – again,” said local council member Katie Valenzuela.
The shootings in Sacramento happened as another incident occurred in Dallas, Texas, where one person was killed and 10 others injured during a shooting at an outdoor concert on Saturday night.
It also comes after last month two people were killed and two injured in a shooting on a public bus in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
