     At Least 6 Dead and 12 Wounded in Shooting in Sacramento, Police Say
    </h2>

     Summary: SACRAMENTO — At least six people were killed and 12 wounded in downtown Sacramento early Sunday, the authorities said, after gunfire erupted outside a strip of crowded bars where nightlife had recently rebounded as the coronavirus pandemic ebbed.
The shooting, a block from the Capitol building, happened shortly after 2 a.m., as clubs closed in an area that had been packed in the aftermath of a nearly sold-out rap show.
Earlier that night Tyler, the Creator had performed at the nearby Golden 1 Center.
Chief Lester asked the public to contact the department with any information about the shooting.
She said that it was unclear how many people had opened fire, and that no one was in custody.
