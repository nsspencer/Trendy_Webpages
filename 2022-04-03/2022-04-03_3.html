     LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga – Best Order to Play the Games In
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After all, while we did get a LEGO Star Wars game based on The Force Awakens, The Skywalker Saga is our first chance to experience The Last Jedi and Revenge of the Sith in all their LEGO gaming glory.
That being the case, I can easily see some longtime LEGO Star Wars fans justifying this strange order simply to get to those entirely new experiences as quickly as possible.
Furthermore, those who have played the previous LEGO Star Wars games may find that enough new content has been added to the original trilogy and prequel trilogy entries to more than justify playing through those stories again before getting to the entirely new stuff.
The biggest advantage to playing through The Skywalker Saga in this order is that it allows you to really put the prequel trilogy in a different context.
Of course, those who simply hate the prequels may still feel odd ending their Skywalker Saga session on them.

Multiplatform Multiplatform Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE "You are never too old to enjoy some Legos or pretend to be a Jedi."
But as I mentioned, the real star of Lego Star Wars is how deftly the game weaves in humor.
Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga knows this and embraces both aspects, while being a lot of fun and very funny.
It’s one of my favorite games of 2022, and while some hardcore Star Wars fans may be loathe to admit it, yes, this is probably the best Star Wars game yet made.

     Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga Review (Switch)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, after just a handful of minutes — yes, minutes — with LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, well… we were completely hooked in and ready to savour every moment of this epic space adventure once more.
Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)Of course, the big question with regards to this Switch version in particular is does it run ok?
If you’ve been following along with development of LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, you’ll likely already know about all the biggest gameplay changes and improvements that have been made to what’s come before in LEGO Star Wars games.
This is LEGO Star Wars like you've never experienced it before.
Overall then, besides the odd lame prequel mission, and a few rough edges and frame rate bumps here and there, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is an absolute triumph on Nintendo Switch.
