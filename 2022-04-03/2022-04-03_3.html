     Watch Poole, Thompson combine for 67, rally Warriors from 16 down to beat Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Klay Thompson scored 36 points and Golden State erased a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Utah Jazz 111-107 and clinch a playoff spot.
Jordan Poole added 31 and Andrew Wiggins had 17 as the Warriors also snapped a four-game losing streak.
“I don’t think we’re in a good place for the last six minutes (of a game),” Utah coach Quin Snyder said.
Poole scored 19 in the first half for the Warriors, including 14 in the second quarter.
Then Thompson heated up in the fourth quarter, whipping the Chase Center crowd into a frenzy with each 3-pointer he made.

     Summary: Such failures are almost par for the course when it comes to the Utah Jazz this season.
WATCH: https://t.co/oz9UCQxdQa pic.twitter.com/OwovAPhLN7 — NBA (@NBA) April 3, 2022We knew it, the Warriors knew it and the Jazz certainly knew it.
For the second time this week, the Utah Jazz found a way to throw a totally winnable game away in just a short manner.
On the bright side, the Jazz should feel good about being able to constantly outplay teams and produce big leads.
But with the postseason nearing, they’ll need to figure out how to keep it together for a full 48 minutes.

     Summary: With 7:17 left in the fourth quarter of their contest against the Golden State Warriors, the Utah Jazz had piled on a 99.5% chance of winning according to ESPN’s win probability metric.

We’ll figure it out.”The Jazz went scoreless for over five minutes and didn’t make another field goal until the 1:22 mark when Mike Conley made a driving layup.
The Jazz star went 0-for-4 from the field while committing a turnover and a foul in the game’s final 7:38.
The Jazz veteran tied Donovan Mitchell for a team-high 26 points.

     Klay Thompson helps Warriors clinch NBA playoff berth with stunning 21-point comeback win over Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors officially clinched a playoff berth on Saturday night with an impressive and much-needed win over the Utah Jazz, 111-107.
For most of the game, it seemed like the Warriors would be heading towards yet another defeat.
The Jazz built a 21-point lead in the second quarter, and were still cruising along with a 16-point advantage with seven minutes to play.
Klay Thompson, who has struggled at times since returning from his two-year absence, looked like his pre-injury self as he led the comeback.
During a stunning 80-second stretch, Thompson hit three 3-pointers and Andrew Wiggins added another to nearly erase the deficit all at once.

     Klay’s explosion and Gobert’s meltdown help Warriors beat Jazz 111-107
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With seven minutes left to play and the Warriors trailing the Utah Jazz 103-87, Thompson hit four three-pointers in a span of 2:41, part of an 18-0 run.
It was a combination of stifling Warriors defense and some stunning Jazz miscues that led to the defeat.
Tuesday, Mitchell was inbounding the ball with ten seconds left and called a timeout the Jazz didn’t have, Chris Webber-style.
The Jazz had two timeouts at the time, so initially, this looked like a heads-up play from Utah’s All-Star guard.
Klay Thompson finished with 36 points and eight three-pointers, five in the final 13 minutes of the game, all of which he played.
