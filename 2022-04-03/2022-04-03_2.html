     Klay Thompson helps Warriors clinch NBA playoff berth with stunning 21-point comeback win over Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors officially clinched a playoff berth on Saturday night with an impressive and much-needed win over the Utah Jazz, 111-107.
For most of the game, it seemed like the Warriors would be heading towards yet another defeat.
The Jazz built a 21-point lead in the second quarter, and were still cruising along with a 16-point advantage with seven minutes to play.
Klay Thompson, who has struggled at times since returning from his two-year absence, looked like his pre-injury self as he led the comeback.
During a stunning 80-second stretch, Thompson hit three 3-pointers and Andrew Wiggins added another to nearly erase the deficit all at once.

     Why Warriors’ win over Jazz was ‘biggest game of the year’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I know they were talking amongst themselves.”Kerr told his coaching staff that the game against the Jazz was the “biggest game of the year.” And the injured Stephen Curry echoed that sentiment to some of his teammates.
The Warriors (49-29) have now secured a playoff spot for the first time since 2019 and own the tiebreaker against the Jazz.
After the game, Poole said the team didn’t directly discuss the game’s implications, though it had to have been in the back of their minds.
“We just know we need to go out there and win games,” Poole said.
The high-intensity ending to Saturday’s game should set the tone for the Warriors entering the final week of the season.

     Klay’s explosion and Gobert’s meltdown help Warriors beat Jazz 111-107
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With seven minutes left to play and the Warriors trailing the Utah Jazz 103-87, Thompson hit four three-pointers in a span of 2:41, part of an 18-0 run.
It was a combination of stifling Warriors defense and some stunning Jazz miscues that led to the defeat.
Tuesday, Mitchell was inbounding the ball with ten seconds left and called a timeout the Jazz didn’t have, Chris Webber-style.
The Jazz had two timeouts at the time, so initially, this looked like a heads-up play from Utah’s All-Star guard.
Klay Thompson finished with 36 points and eight three-pointers, five in the final 13 minutes of the game, all of which he played.
