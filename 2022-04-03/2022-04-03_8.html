     Frank Gore to sign one-day contract with 49ers and retire after 16 NFL seasons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Frank Gore, who played 16 seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, Indianapolis Colts, Miami Dolphins, New York Jets, and Buffalo Bills, told TheSFNiners podcast that he plans to sign a one-day contract with the 49ers at some point in the next few months so that he can retire as a member of the team that drafted him.
He finished his playing career with 3,735 carries for exactly 16,000 yards, third-most in NFL history behind only Emmitt Smith and Walter Payton.
Gore ran for at least 1,000 yards nine times, and totaled at least 1,000 rushing and receiving yards 12 times, third-most in NFL history behind only Smith and Jerry Rice, who each did it 14 times.
Gore's record of durability throughout his career was rather remarkable, as he missed only 15 games in 16 seasons while playing a position that sees more injury and turnover than any other in the NFL.
He ended up making the Pro Bowl five times in 16 seasons, and was named an All-Pro once.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Indianapolis Colts running back Frank Gore is signing a one-day contract to retire with the San Francisco 49ers.
Gore’s best season with the Colts came during the 2016 season when he took 263 carries for 1,025 rushing yards and four touchdowns.
After the 2017 season, Gore signed with the Miami Dolphins (2018), Buffalo Bills (2019) and New York Jets (2020).
Gore’s 16,000 career rushing yards are third-most all-time so there is a more than solid chance he gets into Canton.

     Frank Gore intends to retire with 49ers, join San Francisco front office
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Frank Gore told TheSFNiners.com this week that he is planning on signing a one-day deal with the San Francisco 49ers, the team that drafted him, and retiring from the NFL.
"We still trying to figure out when I'm going through my one-day contract, to sign, do my retirement," Gore said.
Gore has not played in the NFL since the 2020 season, when he tallied 742 total yards and two scores on 203 touches for the New York Jets, his fifth NFL team.
Leading up to the bout, Gore told NFL Network's Cameron Wolfe he would welcome another run at a Super Bowl, potentially with the Niners, but also indicated "I'm happy where I am in life."
If he does indeed retire this offseason without returning to the field again, Gore would finish with 16,000 rushing yards even, the third-most in NFL history behind Emmitt Smith (18.355) and Walter Payton (16,726).

     Summary: Ageless running back Frank Gore has decided to call it a career.
Gore, who will turn 39 in May, was also an effective receiver out of the backfield, particularly in the early days of his career.
Despite all of his individual successes, Gore was not fortunate enough to play for many championship contenders.
In all, Gore rushed for exactly 16,000 yards in the regular season, positioning him behind only Emmitt Smith and Walter Payton on the all-time list.
Per Spotrac, Gore earned over $63MM in his playing career, and he indicated on the podcast that he hopes to move into a front office role.
