     Tottenham thrashes Newcastle 5-1 to rise to 4th in EPL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APLONDON (AP) — Tottenham powered above north London rival Arsenal into the English Premier League top four — for at least one day — by thrashing Newcastle 5-1 on Sunday.
Newcastle took the lead through Fabian Schar's free kick in the 39th minute but couldn't handle the relentless attacks of Tottenham.
Tottenham moved into fourth place on goal difference ahead of Arsenal, which has two games in hand — the first coming at Crystal Palace on Monday.
Tottenham and Arsenal are five points behind third-placed Chelsea.
Royal scored his first goal for Tottenham by poking in Doherty's cross in the 63rd, and Bergwijn raced through the middle of Newcastle's defense to score the fifth in the 83rd.

     Summary: LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte hailed his side's recent progress and said that months of hard work was paying off after they moved into the Premier League top four with a 5-1 thrashing of Newcastle United at home on Sunday.
Conte replaced Nuno Espirito Santo in November, with Tottenham ninth in the standings and five points off the Champions League places.
"Now I have had the work of five or six months, to work and bring my idea of football and mentality...
"This league is very difficult to try to be in the race for the Champions League.

     Christian Eriksen could be missing link in Tottenham’s revived attack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It would have been somewhat of a surprise if the Tottenham manager felt the same after 40 minutes of this encounter.
Down on the touchline a furious Conte could barely contain his frustration as he stamped his feet.
Spurs’ attack thrived against Newcastle, but Eriksen could add another dimension to their play.
One big question would be how Eriksen would fit into this system, which is designed to get the best out of Kulusevski and Son.
One searing half-volley from Kane was destined for the top corner until it struck the unfortunate Emerson clean in the face.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham vs. Newcastle looked to be a fairly even game judging from the first half despite possessional control from Spurs .
The wingbacks combined again as Doherty got forward on the left to find Emerson Royal attacking the near post for the fourth.
83rd min: GOAL!
It's more or less as expected, but Emerson Royal and Doherty both start, with no Reguilon.
There's no Reguilon and Sessegnon is also unavailable, so Spurs line up with Doherty and Emerson Royal as the wing backs.
