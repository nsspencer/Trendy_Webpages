     Summary: The countdown to The Masters is on, and that includes a Tiger Woods countdown as well.
Increasingly, it looks like the answer is yes for Woods, a five-time Masters champ.
The optimism spiked on Monday afternoon after Fred Couples, who had just finished a practice round with Woods, said he was "sure" Woods will be in the field.
Woods was back today, and knocked out a round with Thomas and Couples.
What's below and how to watch: We'll have news updates, buzz from the course, and follow Tiger shot for shot if he plays.

     Afterthought: DeChambeau looks to regain swagger at Masters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeChambeau has been limited by hip and hand ailments in recent months, which leaves him at less than full strength and a bit of an afterthought heading into the Masters.
DeChambeau didn't come close to backing up those bold words.
A year ago, when the Masters returned to its usual spot in the spring, DeChambeau turned in another lackluster showing.
The injuries have humbled DeChambeau, who tossed out an 80% figure when asked how close he was to being 100%.
“We’re finally moving in a direction that I feel is positive for me being able to win again,” DeChambeau said.

While it is not for sure just yet, all signs are pointing towards five-time Masters Champion Tiger Woods teeing it up in the year’s first Major.
— Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) April 3, 2022Wow, This Might HappenSince the tweet was posted, Tiger has made it to Augusta National and began on-course preparation.
If Tiger Woods does in fact compete in this year’s Masters, it is hard to imagine a scenario where he doesn’t succeed.
And hopefully, we are graced with the sound of ” Fore please, Tiger Woods now driving” Thursday.

     Bryson DeChambeau Says His Health is at 80% Heading Into Masters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DeChambeau has struggled in his two events leading into the Masters, while his body continues to recover from a series of early-season injuries.
AUGUSTA, Ga. -- It wasn’t long ago that Bryson DeChambeau was the number one needle-mover on the PGA Tour, with his prodigious length that was awe-inspiring.
Yet, many believed his body -- in fact, no body -- could consistently sustain ball speed of over 200 mph.
DeChambeau reached 219 mph at the 2021 World Long Drive Championship and consistently exceeded 200 mph on Tour.
That drive was the single most popular shot of 2021, but that was then and just over a year since then DeChambeau has struggled with his health and his game.

     Injured Bryson DeChambeau enjoying lower profile before 2022 Masters
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bryson DeChambeau has always done things his own way but even he is taking it a little far at this year’s Masters.
Tiger Woods said the way DeChambeau was playing back then was “unprecedented” and “historic”.
But this year, “coming off an injury, not being really fully ready it’s kind of been nice going into this year’s Masters just peacefully”.
Woods’s gallery is so big that DeChambeau says the atmosphere surrounding everyone else almost feels relaxing in comparison.
His results here have been underwhelming since he finished 21st on his debut in 2016, when he was the low amateur.

     Summary: He decided to give it a go because he wanted to give this tournament a run.
Which, as many golf fans pointed out, are scores markedly higher than the par 67 DeChambeau claimed he viewed Augusta National as in 2020.
But on Monday DeChambeau asserted his inconsistency here lies not with the short game but his swing.
I've had maybe a good wedge day; I've had a good putting day; I've had maybe good iron play day, a good driving day one day,” DeChambeau said.
He’s had to recalibrate his methods and noted he’s no longer “21,” which is true but somewhat concerning given he’s only 28.

In fact, no player without a major championship already on the resume is a more obvious Masters pick than Smith, ranked sixth in the world.
