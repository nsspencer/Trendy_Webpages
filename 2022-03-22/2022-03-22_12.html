     Vikings Twitter explodes after Za'Darius Smith signing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Minnesota Vikings fans have been on the edge of their seats ever since it was announced that two-time Pro Bowl outside linebacker Za’Darius Smith was in town for a visit.
The thought of Smith joining Danielle Hunter and creating one of the best one-two punch combos in the NFL had SKOL nation begging the football gods to move mountains, manifest miracles and basically, do whatever it took to ensure a deal went through.
Now, the former Green Bay Packer will be wearing purple in 2022 after agreeing to a three-year, $42 million deal with the Vikings.
The pipe dream of a Smith and Hunter defensive combo has become a reality.
After a relatively quiet free agency, Vikings fans were ready to unleash after hearing news of the deal on Tuesday.

     Vikings signing former Packers OLB Za'Darius Smith to three-year, $42M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a tumultuous free agency period, Za'Darius Smith is back in the NFC North.
After being released by the Green Bay Packers, Smith initially agreed to a four-year, $35 million deal (worth a max of $50 million) to return to Baltimore.
The okey-doke netted Smith a bigger payday.
It's a boom-or-bust signing for the Vikings, who desperately needed a talent infusion on defense this offseason.
Pairing Smith with Danielle Hunter gives Minnesota two dynamic edge rushers who can win one-on-ones.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ever since rumors first began to circulate about the impending release of veteran pass rusher Za’Darius Smith from the Green Bay Packers, a potential reunion between the two-time Pro Bowler and the Baltimore Ravens shortly followed thereafter.
Former Packers’ pass rusher Za'Darius Smith is signing a four-year, $35 million deal that has a max value of $50 million with the Baltimore Ravens, per source.
Plot twist: Former #Packers pass-rusher Za'Darius Smith is not signing his deal with the #Ravens after all, sources say.
Less than a week later, the saga came to a disappointing conclusion, as Smith will be back in purple and playing in a northern division for the foreseeable future.
Za’Darius Smith agreed to terms with the #Vikings, source said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having backed out of a contract with the Ravens, Za'Darius Smith will be getting a lot of money from the Vikings to sack Aaron Rodgers.
GREEN BAY, Wis. – If Za’Darius Smith was a source of frustration for the Green Bay Packers in 2021, just wait until 2022.
Because the Packers released Za’Darius Smith, they will not gain a compensatory draft pick next offseason.
After opening his career in Baltimore, Za’Darius Smith joined the Packers in 2019 on a monster four-year, $66 million contract.
Za’Darius Smith sought motivation anywhere and everywhere.

     Summary: "They were like these four guys right here [were] in the Pro Bowl at the time.
I don't know too many people [who] come back from back surgery," Smith added.
Smith will hope to recapture the form he had in 2019 and 2020 when he earned back-to-back Pro Bowl honors and terrorized the rest of the league.
He recorded careers highs in sacks (13.5) and tackles for loss (17) in 2019 to make his first Pro Bowl.
Smith followed that up with another Pro Bowl season with 12.5 sacks, also earning Second-Team All-Pro honors from The Associated Press.
