So, to help prevent potential uncertainty or indecisiveness over what they want to order, the team sent the house again on Tuesday.
24 hours after filing into Pittsburgh for Pickett’s pro day, the Panthers had all of their top decision-makers present to see Willis’ showcase at the Liberty University practice facility.
