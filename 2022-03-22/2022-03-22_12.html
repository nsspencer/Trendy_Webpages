     Megan Thee Stallion's Latest Legal Battle With Carl Crawford Is Yet Another Cautionary Tale For Artists
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Megan Thee Stallion and Carl Crawford are serving us a learning lesson right before our eyes.
Crawford, who recently filed a countersuit against the “Tina Snow” rapper, has taken umbrage with his artist’s filing of a lawsuit against his label, 1501 Certified Entertainment, and has slapped her with a countersuit.
If you believe Carl Crawford, she did not.
“This is yet another absurd attempt by 1501 to disregard Megan’s album and squeeze more money and more free work out of her for as long as possible,” said Brad Hancock, the lawyer for Megan Thee Stallion.
Aside from this all being a cautionary tale for artists who sign predatory record deals, we decided to take a look at the facts of the case to see whether Megan Thee Stallion or Carl Crawford could, ultimately, prevail.

     Megan Thee Stallion Confronts People Who Doubt Her Shooting Story: 'Y'all Choosing to Be Dumb'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the days since, several other musicians followed Rih’s lead: Drake, Nicki Minaj, Ciara, and Kylie Jenner all unfollowed the “Lick” rapper.
Meg’s Savage X Fenty partnership was announced in May 2020 and, since then, the “Savage” rapper has appeared in multiple campaigns.
Most notably, she was featured in the lingerie brand’s summer 2020 social media campaign #SavagexTheeStallion and their exclusive holiday campaign.
Megan accused the rapper of shooting her in “both feet” after attending a party held at Kylie Jenner’s house in LA back on July 2020—which could explain why Kylie unfollowed Meg.
Interesting timing for such a video to drop, as Lanez’s pre-trial hearing for the alleged shooting falls on April 5th.

Megan Thee Stallion says that 1501 isn’t letting her drop new music due to her requesting to renegotiate her contract.

     Five Burning Questions: Dua Lipa and Megan Thee Stallion’s ‘Sweetest Pie’ Debuts at No. 15
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s what we got earlier this March with the release of “Sweetest Pie,” the first ever teamup between Megan Thee Stallion and Dua Lipa.
“Sweetest Pie” debuts at No.
So even if “Sweetest Pie” fails to take a bite of the top 10 in the near future, landing this close at all is quite impressive.
But if either artist returns with a new project in the coming months, then “Sweetest Pie” would be a timely top 20 hit previewing that project.
Musically, the single doesn’t sound like a stark departure or declarative statement by either artist, so I wouldn’t expect “Sweetest Pie” to function as a lead single.
