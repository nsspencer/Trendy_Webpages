     Factbox-What is Okta, hacked authentication services provider
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Reuters) – San Francisco-based Okta Inc, a widely used access management company that competes with the likes of PingID and Duo to provide online authentication services, said it was investigating a digital breach on Tuesday.
Okta said the breach could be connected to an earlier incident in January.
Okta sells identity services, such as Single Sign-On and Multi-factor Authentication used to log in to online applications and websites.
Hundreds of large companies, such as FedEx Corp, T-Mobile US Inc, Moody’s Corp and Coinbase Global Inc, use Okta’s services.
Global cloud services provider Cloudflare Inc also uses Okta.

     Here’s what to know about the reported hack on Okta
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A hacking group called LAPSUS$ claimed late Monday to have breached systems belonging to Okta , a company that builds services to securely log people in to apps and networks.
Based on our investigation to date, there is no evidence of ongoing malicious activity beyond the activity detected in January.
(2 of 2)The shadowy organization released screenshots that appeared to show access to Okta internal systems, including an internal ticketing system and a Slack chat, Reuters reports .
Still, the incident likely has some Okta customers on edge, since the service is used to control access to its customers’ sensitive systems.
Matthew Prince, the CEO of hosting provider Cloudflare, tweeted that the company is resetting Okta credentials for employees who recently changed their passwords, “out of an abundance of caution,” and it seems likely that other Okta customers will be carefully looking for evidence they were further affected by any hack.

     Lapsu$ group claims Okta supply chain attacks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lapsu$ extortion group posted screenshots to its Telegram channel Monday night they say prove they breached identity management vendor Okta.
The group said the Okta breach was not intended to get data from Okta, but instead leverage the access to Okta to attack Okta clients.
Lapsu$ Telegram post.
After posting screenshots, Lapsu$ claimed in an all-capital-letters update, that Okta was breached not for its own data, but as a supply chain attack.
According to Brett Callow, a ransom group expert with Emsisoft, any Lapsu$ claims should be taken with a professional criminal-sized grain of salt.

     LAPSUS$ ransomware group claims Okta breach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ransomware group LAPSUS$ has claimed to have breached the internal systems of cloud-based authentication software provider Okta.
The breach was first flagged on Twitter by Bill Demirkapi, a senior security engineer at video conferencing company Zoom, at 8:15pm Pacific Time on Monday night.
According to the LAPSUS$ screenshots, taken from the secure messaging service Telegram and posted online by Demirkapi and others, the ransomware group said it did not target Okta's databases, instead focusing on Okta customers.
Okta then issued another statement later that day asserting that "the Okta service has not been breached and remains fully operational.
LAPSUS$ is the same ransomware group that recently successfully breached both Samsung and Nvidia.

     Okta investigating reports of possible digital breach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Okta, an identity authentication service with more than 15,000 customers, said Tuesday that an attacker had access to a support engineer's laptop for five days in January.
The Okta service that customers use to authenticate logins "has not been breached and remains fully operational," Okta Chief Security Officer David Bradbury said in a blog post Tuesday.
The new details came hours after Okta said it was investigating reports of a possible digital breach.
Reuters first reported that Okta was looking into reports of a possible digital breach after a hacking group known as Lapsus$ claimed responsibility for the incident and published screenshots claiming access to an Okta internal administrative account and the firm's Slack channel.
Lapsus$, a mysterious hacking group that emerged in December, claimed on the messaging app Telegram that it did not steal any databases from Okta itself, but that "our focus was ONLY on Okta customers."

     'This Is Really, Really Bad': Lapsus$ Gang Claims Okta Hack
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Monday evening, the Lapsus$ digital extortion gang published a series of increasingly shocking posts in its Telegram channel.
First, the group dumped what it claims is extensive source code from Microsoft's Bing search engine, Bing Maps, and Cortana virtual assistant software.
When they're attacking Twitter accounts, hackers can lock legitimate users out and tweet from their profiles.
When you have this type of access for an identity platform like Okta, though, the potential impacts are exponentially more extreme.
“In late January 2022, Okta detected an attempt to compromise the account of a third-party customer support engineer working for one of our subprocessors.

     Okta hack puts thousands of businesses on high alert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Any hack of Okta could have major ramifications for the companies, universities, and government agencies that depend upon Okta to authenticate user access to internal systems.
Support engineers do have access to limited data - for example, Jira tickets and lists of users - that were seen in the screenshots.
Support engineers are also able to facilitate the resetting of passwords and MFA factors for users, but are unable to obtain those passwords.
The group also suggested it was using its access to zero in on Okta’s customers.
Okta says it terminated its support engineer’s Okta sessions and suspended the account back in January, but claims it only received the final report from its forensics firm this week.
