     Summary: GREEN BAY, Wis. (WBAY) - Za’Darius Smith is staying in the NFC North.
Za’Darius Smith agreed to terms with the Minnesota Vikings, per source.
But he will receive more money up front with the Vikings, and he will be reunited with his former coaches in Green Bay.
Mike Pettine and Mike Smith, Za’Darius’ defensive coordinator and position coach in Green Bay, are both on the Vikings’ staff.
Smith played 3 seasons in Green Bay after signing as a free agent in 2019.

     Former Green Bay Packers linebacker Za'Darius Smith signs with rival Minnesota Vikings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREEN BAY - The Green Bay Packers will be playing against Za'Darius Smith twice a year now that the free-agent outside linebacker has signed with NFC North rival Minnesota.
NFL Network reported that Smith agreed to a three-year, $42 million deal with the Vikings.
During his three seasons (37 games) with the Packers, Smith accumulated 121 tackles, 30 sacks and five forced fumbles.
“We want to thank Za’Darius for his contributions to the Packers over the past three seasons,” Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said in a statement after Smith's release.
“He came in and made an immediate impact on this football team, helping the team win three straight division titles.

     Vikings signing two-time Pro Bowl OLB Za'Darius Smith
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Corrections/clarifications: In a previous version of this post, Vikings Wire cited a now-deleted Twitter post on Za’Darius Smith’s signing.
The Minnesota Vikings are bringing in a formal rival to add even more firepower to a defensive unit that finished with the second-most sacks in 2021.
Two-time Pro Bowl linebacker and former Green Bay Packer, Za’Darius Smith, is reportedly signing with the Vikings on a three-year, $42 million deal and staying in the NFC North.
The thought of Smith lining up opposite of two-time Pro Bowl defensive end Danielle Hunter is every quarterback’s worst nightmare.
Smith has shown the ability to generate turnovers consistently in ways that tilt the game in his team’s favor.

According to Tom Pelissero of NFL Network, Smith – who was released by the Packers earlier this month – is signing a three-year deal with the Minnesota Vikings.

Mike Smith is the team’s new pass-rushing coach.

     Vikings signing former Packers OLB Za'Darius Smith to three-year, $42M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a tumultuous free agency period, Za'Darius Smith is back in the NFC North.
After being released by the Green Bay Packers, Smith initially agreed to a four-year, $35 million deal (worth a max of $50 million) to return to Baltimore.
The okey-doke netted Smith a bigger payday.
It's a boom-or-bust signing for the Vikings, who desperately needed a talent infusion on defense this offseason.
Pairing Smith with Danielle Hunter gives Minnesota two dynamic edge rushers who can win one-on-ones.

     Vikings Agree to Terms with Linebacker Za'Darius Smith
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EAGAN, Minn. — One of the Vikings biggest rivals in recent seasons has agreed to join the squad.
Minnesota announced Tuesday it has agreed to terms on a three-year contract with Za'Darius Smith, a veteran outside linebacker who spent the past three seasons with Green Bay.
Smith, who made the Pro Bowl in each of his first two seasons with the Packers, played just 18 snaps in 2021 due to a back injury.
Smith dealt with the injury in training camp and played in Green Bay's season opener, but didn't see the field for the rest of the season.
The 29-year-old, who has 44.5 career sacks, has plenty of experience in a 3-4 defensive scheme.
