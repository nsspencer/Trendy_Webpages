     Vikings signing former Packers OLB Za'Darius Smith to three-year, $42M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a tumultuous free agency period, Za'Darius Smith is back in the NFC North.
After being released by the Green Bay Packers, Smith initially agreed to a four-year, $35 million deal (worth a max of $50 million) to return to Baltimore.
The okey-doke netted Smith a bigger payday.
It's a boom-or-bust signing for the Vikings, who desperately needed a talent infusion on defense this offseason.
Pairing Smith with Danielle Hunter gives Minnesota two dynamic edge rushers who can win one-on-ones.
