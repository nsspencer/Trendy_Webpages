     Bob Saget's Hotel Room Photos of Headboard That Could Have Caused Death
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bob Saget may have died after hitting his head on the headboard in his Orlando hotel room -- at least that's what authorities believe -- and they have just released photos of the object.
The headboard -- in the Ritz-Carlton hotel room -- is padded, although cops say there's a hard surface underneath ... they believe Bob hit his head on that surface, which caused a fatal brain bleed.
The reason for the theory -- Bob's head was not bleeding externally when they discovered his body.
The reason they're sticking to the headboard theory -- the Medical Examiner concluded Bob hit his head on "something hard, covered by something soft."
There's also the interview cops did with the hotel valet, who says Bob was in good spirits when he arrived just after 2 AM.

The images, which were part of Saget's full death report obtained by PEOPLE on Tuesday, show the Ritz-Carlton hotel room in Orlando, Florida, where the 65-year-old actor's body was found on Jan. 9.
Last week, The Orlando Sentinel reported that Judge Chiu blocked the release of some photos taken at the scene of Saget's death, reportedly including 90 of the 147 photos taken during the OCSO's investigation.
The 57 photos of Saget's hotel room will "not be protected by any statutory exemption," Judge Chiu said, according to the Sentinel.
