     Malik Willis makes incredible throw during Pro Day (video)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Liberty quarterback Malik Willis has quickly made a name for himself as one of the top prospects at his position ahead of the 2022 NFL draft.
His performance at his Pro Day on Tuesday will only further solidify his stature around the league.
The 22-year-old quarterback ran down the field celebrating before receiving messages of congratulations from the rest of the players participating in Liberty’s Pro Day.
Willis’s throw, as well as his general performance on Tuesday, will give him another significant boost ahead of next month’s draft where he’s considered to be among the top quarterback prospects.
Willis will make way for the NFL after an impressive collegiate career at Liberty.

     Takeaways and reactions from Malik Willis' pro day at Liberty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Eagles have pledge their allegiance to Jalen Hurts, but that didn’t stop Philadelphia or 31 other NFL teams from descending onto Lynchburg, Virginia for Liberty’s Pro Day.
The star of the show was quarterback Malik Willis, who put on a dazzling performance, displaying his skill, athleticism, big arm and some new found touch.
Willis had dinner with Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin and his outstanding performance could make some non-quarterback needy teams take a pause on the matter.
Here are takeaways and reactions from Tuesday.

     2022 NFL Draft: Five takeaways from Liberty QB Malik Willis, Texas A&amp;M pro days
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1) Tuesday was a good day for Malik Willis.
The QB acknowledged that he missed a couple of throws during his post-workout interview with NFL Network's Steve Wyche.
It's true that his ball placement wasn't perfect every time, but all in all, Willis was very impressive during his throwing session.
That said, he displayed the ability to slow the tempo down on underneath throws when necessary.
"More or less, I was just trying to show them anything they wanted to see," Willis told Wyche of his pro-day strategy.

     Panthers checking out Malik Willis Tuesday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Other than subjects of trade speculation such as Jimmy Garappolo and Baker Mayfield (both of whom come with expensive contracts), there's not a lot out there in the veteran market, which makes prospects like Willis more interesting.
Of course, Willis is appealing in his own right, as the high-ceiling pick in this year's draft.
As he showed at the Senior Bowl, Willis has an incredible arm and can run, but sometimes struggles with accuracy.
In two years at Liberty, he threw for 5,107 yards and 47 touchdowns, and ran for another 1,822 yards and 27 touchdowns.

     Mike Tomlin, Steelers brass attend top quarterback prospect Malik Willis' pro day at Liberty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite acquiring former Pro Bowler Mitchell Trubisky last week, the Steelers are clearly still open to using their first-round pick on another quarterback.
On Monday, Pittsburgh's brass stayed in town to check out Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett's pro day.
On Tuesday, Colbert, head coach Mike Tomlin and offensive coordinator Matt Canada were among Pittsburgh's contingent who traveled to Liberty to take in Malik Willis' pro day.
By all accounts, Willis enjoyed a successful Pro Day while showcasing his ability to connect on deep passes.
Half of our experts have the Steelers using the pick on former Cincinnati quarterback Desmond Ritter, who this past fall led the Bearcats to an undefeated regular season.

     Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin among attendees for Liberty QB Malik Willis' pro day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Todd McShay discusses his initial reactions to Malik Willis' performance at Liberty's pro day and why the QB's not far off from Lamar Jackson in some ways.
Willis and Pittsburgh's Kenny Pickett, who held his pro day Monday, could be that.
There was nothing weak about Willis' pro day, which drew fewer than the 120 observers originally expected after free agency reset the quarterback market.
The pro day also showcased what Freeze sees every day in practice, that Willis knows how to enjoy himself while being productive.
Willis didn't participate in any drills other than throwing.
