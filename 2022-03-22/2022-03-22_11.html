     Summary: GREEN BAY, WISCONSIN - DECEMBER 27: Za'Darius Smith #55 of the Green Bay Packers anticipates a play during a game against the Tennessee Titans at Lambeau Field on December 27, 2020 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
(Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)It’s been quite a rollercoaster affair for pass rusher Za’Darius Smith in free agency this offseason, but the veteran defensive end has finally found an actual home with the Minnesota Vikings, per NFL reporter Ian Rapoport.
Earlier this offseason, the Baltimore Ravens were believed to have won the sweepstakes to sign Smith after the Green Bay Packers decided they were going to let him hit the open market.
Despite the verbal agreement, Smith decided to head back to free agency after the Ravens reportedly refused to acquiesce to new proposals by Smith’s agent after seeing what other pass rushers were getting in free agency.
Pass rusher Za’Darius Smith has signed with the Minnesota Vikings.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a tumultuous free agency period, Za'Darius Smith is back in the NFC North.
After being released by the Green Bay Packers, Smith initially agreed to a four-year, $35 million deal (worth a max of $50 million) to return to Baltimore.
The okey-doke netted Smith a bigger payday.
It's a boom-or-bust signing for the Vikings, who desperately needed a talent infusion on defense this offseason.
Pairing Smith with Danielle Hunter gives Minnesota two dynamic edge rushers who can win one-on-ones.
