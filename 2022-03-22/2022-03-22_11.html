     No. 1 Ashleigh Barty, Just 25, Retiring From Tennis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: She is the first women’s player to retire while on top of the singles rankings since the Belgian star Justine Henin unexpectedly announced her retirement in May 2008.
Henin, like Barty, was just 25 years old and the reigning champion at two Grand Slam tournaments: the French Open and the U.S. Open in Henin’s case.
Henin later returned to the tour in 2010, although she never won another major title.
For now, and perhaps for eternity, Barty has finished her career with $23.8 million in prize money and 15 career singles titles, including three at Grand Slam tournaments.
She won the French Open in 2019, Wimbledon in 2021 and the Australian Open this year, meaning that she won major singles titles on all three of tennis’ primary surfaces: clay, grass and hardcourt.
