     How FBI: Most Wanted Will 'Reinvigorate' The Task Force With Dylan McDermott's New Character After Losing Jess, According To Showrunner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Most Wanted showrunner David Hudgins spoke with CinemaBlend about the arrival of McDermott’s character and what it means for the Task Force as a whole on the hit CBS series.
Who's it going to be?’ And the Fugitive Task Force is a very elite squad within the FBI, so it's a search that they take very seriously.
Dylan McDermott’s character will evidently be vetted as the “right person,” but how will the other characters receive this newcomer in their midst?
In contrast, the Most Wanted character will be an agent introduced into an elite FBI squad.
Even though Richard Wheatley was about as far from a character worthy of joining a Fugitive Task Force for the FBI as could be, Dylan McDermott has plenty of experience playing a variety of roles.
