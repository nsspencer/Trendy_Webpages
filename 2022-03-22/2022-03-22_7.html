     The Knicks Have Signed A New Player
    </h2>

     Summary: On Thursday, the New York Knicks announced that they have signed Feron Hunt.
The announcement from the team can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Knicks PR.
Hunt is 22-year-old, and went undrafted out of SMU in this past summer's NBA Draft.
He played in the NBA Summer League and the preseason with the Dallas Mavericks, but did not make the regular season roster.

     Summary: NEW YORK -- Knicks forward Julius Randle was penalized $40,000 by the NBA on Tuesday for directing hostile language at a referee, bringing his total to $130,000 in fines this season.
Randle engaged in lengthy conversations with the officials as well as shoving Jazz center Rudy Gobert.
Last season's winner of the Most Improved Player award has lost his emotions at times in this disappointing season for the Knicks.
The Knicks also were penalized $25,000 in January for violating league access rules when Randle refused to speak to the media.
"You're human, there's going to be emotions involved in it," Thibodeau said, "but we have to make sure we're controlling our emotions."

The only winning record was when they went 41-31 last season to earn the No.
The Hawks then beat them in five games in the first round of the playoffs.
Young was the star in his first postseason series, ignoring the profane taunts from fans and bowing to the crowd from near midcourt late in Game 5.
Young missed the return trip when he was sidelined for the Christmas game because of the NBA’s health and safety protocols.

     Summary: Julius Randle is making $21.8 million this season, and next season a four-year $117 million extension activates.
I say this to put into perspective the $130,000 that Randle has been fined this season; the man isn't exactly going broke.
Randle is having a tough season, as are the Knicks, and I'm sure that's adding to his frustrations in these moments.
Randle is putting up 20 points and 10 rebounds a night, so let's also have some perspective on the "tough season" tag.
Entering play on Tuesday night, the Knicks were 30-41 and five games back of the East's final play-in spot.
