     The Knicks Have Signed A New Player
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Thursday, the New York Knicks announced that they have signed Feron Hunt.
The announcement from the team can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Knicks PR.
Hunt is 22-year-old, and went undrafted out of SMU in this past summer's NBA Draft.
He played in the NBA Summer League and the preseason with the Dallas Mavericks, but did not make the regular season roster.
The Knicks are currently the 12th seed in the Eastern Conference with a 30-41 record in the 71 games that they have played in so far this season.

     Knicks' Julius Randle Fined $40K for Using 'Hostile Language' Toward Official
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesSunday's loss to the Utah Jazz was a costly one for New York Knicks forward Julius Randle.
The NBA announced Tuesday it fined him $40,000 "for directing hostile language toward a game official" during the contest.
This is nothing new for Randle, who has been fined five times this season.
After the duo exchanged words and bumped chests late in the third quarter, Randle went through an official to shove Johnson.
The Knicks announced Randle will not be on the court for Tuesday's game against the Atlanta Hawks because of a sore right quadriceps tendon.

     Miles McBride knocks on Knicks door after another G League milestone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Knicks recalled rookie Miles McBride after another career game in the G League.
Through nine games in the developmental league, McBride averages 29.1 points, 5.8 rebounds, a league-leading 11.1 assists, and 2.7 steals.
McBride could earn minutes with the second unit and help shadow Trae Young, the prolific Hawks’ point guard.
In January, McBride hinted why the Knicks are sending him back and forth to their G League club.
He should get his chances in the Knicks’ remaining games, especially when they officially kiss their postseason hopes goodbye.

     What a difference a year makes for Knicks-Hawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A mere 303 days earlier, this had been the hottest ticket in town and these were the two teams on everyone’s tongues.
The Hawks’ Danilo Gallinari defends Julius Randle during Game 1 of the Knicks-Hawks 2021 playoff series.
And it is remarkable through that lens to see what has happened in only 303 days.
But the Hawks aren’t the real issue here, 303 days later.
That would’ve been hard to believe 303 days earlier.
