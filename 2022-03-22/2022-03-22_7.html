     Summary: The Baltimore Ravens’ loss could be the Houston Texans’ treasure.
Za’Darius Smith has been one of the better pass rushers in NFL for the last few seasons.
As a result, Smith is once again a free agent, and the Houston Texans and Lovie Smith should be calling Smith’s agent right now.
Houston Texans need pass rush help with Matt Ryan in the AFC SouthWhen the Colts struck a deal for Matt Ryan, it was an incredible value.
Regardless, Smith would be the perfect counter-attack to help the Texans in their climb out of the basement.

     Summary: After a tumultuous free agency period, Za'Darius Smith is back in the NFC North.
After being released by the Green Bay Packers, Smith initially agreed to a four-year, $35 million deal (worth a max of $50 million) to return to Baltimore.
The okey-doke netted Smith a bigger payday.
It's a boom-or-bust signing for the Vikings, who desperately needed a talent infusion on defense this offseason.
Pairing Smith with Danielle Hunter gives Minnesota two dynamic edge rushers who can win one-on-ones.
