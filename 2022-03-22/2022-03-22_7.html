     Summary: The Baltimore Ravens’ loss could be the Houston Texans’ treasure.
Za’Darius Smith has been one of the better pass rushers in NFL for the last few seasons.
As a result, Smith is once again a free agent, and the Houston Texans and Lovie Smith should be calling Smith’s agent right now.

     Summary: After a tumultuous free agency period, Za'Darius Smith is back in the NFC North.
After being released by the Green Bay Packers, Smith initially agreed to a four-year, $35 million deal (worth a max of $50 million) to return to Baltimore.
