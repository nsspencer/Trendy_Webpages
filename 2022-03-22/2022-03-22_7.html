     UFC welterweights Colby Covington, Jorge Masvidal in alleged dust-up outside Miami Beach restaurant; police called to scene
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colby Covington scored a lopsided unanimous decision over Jorge Masvidal when they met earlier this month at UFC 272, but apparently they have unfinished business.
The UFC stars were allegedly involved in an incident outside the Miami Beach hot spot Papi Steak on Monday around 11:30 p.m., according to TMZ, which obtained video of police at the scene.
A Miami Beach Police Information Officer didn't respond to messages seeking comment.
Masvidal, 37, is a native of Miami, while Covington now resides in the city.
The defeat was Masvidal's third consecutive, including two losses to Kamaru Usman, in his attempts to win the UFC welterweight championship.

     Summary: Colby Covington and Jorge Masvidal appear to truly have beef.
The two UFC fighters were allegedly involved in a street brawl outside of a restaurant in Miami, Florida.
The two fought a few weeks ago back at UFC 272 where Colby Covington won by unanimous decision.
A video was shared of the UFC fighter’s location and Jorge Masvidal went to the restaurant to confront him.
Currently, it appears Masvidal would be the one in trouble with Colby Covington allegedly not throwing any strikes of his own.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Twenty-five minutes together inside the octagon apparently wasn’t enough for Jorge Masvidal and Colby Covington to settle their grudge.
Within an hour of Slater’s report, Masvidal posted a video on Twitter in which he seemingly relished what allegedly transpired between him and Covington.
After the initial report and tweets from Masvidal and managers, a video obtained by TMZ early Tuesday morning showed Covington surrounded by Miami police officers outside of the restaurant at about 11:30 p.m.
According to TMZ, Masvidal allegedly attacked Covington outside of the restaurant.
Afterward, Covington, who now trains at MMA Masters, declared himself the “king of Miami,” which Masvidal took exception to.
