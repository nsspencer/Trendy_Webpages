     Summary: Pfizer launches a recall of blood pressure drugs due to a potential carcinogenEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Lennihan/AP Mark Lennihan/APPfizer Inc. is recalling a blood pressure drug due to elevated levels of a potential cancer-causing impurity.
The recall is voluntary, according to the company, and the company says that as of Monday, it has not received any reports of adverse events related to the drugs.
"Although long- term ingestion of N-nitroso-quinapril may be associated with a potential increased cancer risk in humans, there is no immediate risk to patients taking this medication," it adds.
Pfizer suggests patients taking the tablets should consult with their healthcare provider or pharmacy to determine if they've been given an affected batch.

     Pfizer recalls blood pressure medicines over carcinogen
    </h2>

     Summary: (CNN) - Pfizer is voluntarily recalling its blood pressure drug Accuretic because there’s too much of a particular impurity called nitrosamines.
The impurity is common in water and food like cured and grilled meats, dairy and vegetables, but it could increase the risk of cancer if you’re exposed to too much for too long.
Though there haven’t been reports of anything happening to people who’ve taken this medication, Pfizer is recalling it just in case.
The recall includes the brand name and two generics.

     Pfizer Recalls Some Blood Pressure Drugs Nationwide Over Potential Cancer Risk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pfizer is recalling certain lots of a popular blood pressure drug nationwide as well as two authorized generics distributed directly to patients by a subsidiary because of higher-than-acceptable levels of a nitrosamine linked to potential cancer risk.
The "impurities" could increase cancer risk if people are exposed to them above acceptable levels over long periods of time, research says.
Pfizer says it believes the benefit of its recalled blood pressure-lowering medications outweighs the risk associated with the nitrosamine found in them (in this case, N-nitroso-quinapril), based on currently available data.
"Although long-term ingestion of N-nitroso-quinapril may be associated with a potential increased cancer risk in humans, there is no immediate risk to patients taking this medication.
Wholesalers and distributors with an existing inventory of lots listed in the recall should stop use and distribution and quarantine the products immediately, Pfizer said.
