     90 Day Fiancé: Everything Mahogany Told Ben That Turned Out To Be Lies

     Summary: Mahogany Roca from 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days thinks that Ben Rathbun is “different” than the man she was talking to online, but she also refuses to address the lies she told him before and after they finally met.
Fans predicted that 90 Day Fiancé franchise star Mahogany from B90 would be a scammer ever since they saw her heavily edited selfies with filters in the B90 trailer.
Also, 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days has yet to confirm why Mahogany took a $1000 loan from Ben when her family appears to be well-off and she has a job with a decent salary.
Mahogany’s lies have been swept under the rug by Ben, who eventually did end up becoming her boyfriend.
