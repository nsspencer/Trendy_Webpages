     Ted Cruz's run in with the law: Cops called for conflict with airline employee at Montana airport
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) appeared to be leaving Montana on Sunday when he had a conflict with an airline employee, a video posted to Reddit said.
Cruz was flying out of Bozeman International Airport when he was angered by something not identified in the video and police were called to intervene.
Raw Story reporter Bob Brigham confirmed that this is Bozeman airport.
He appeared to be wearing his signature grey mask with the condom-shaped cannon on it reading, "Come and take it."
Raw Story has reached out to Cruz to confirm if it was him in the video and what the problem was at the airport.

     Ted Cruz airport incident in Montana
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: articlePolice were called after Sen. Ted Cruz reportedly got in an argument with airline workers at a Montana airport.
A person who posted a video of the aftermath of the incident on Reddit claimed that Ted Cruz, wearing a mask, was "accosting" airline employees at the airport after allegedly missing his flight.
A law enforcement officer was there to help defuse the situation, Scott Humphrey, a deputy director of Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport, told the Daily Mail.
After the law enforcement officer stepped in to assist, Cruz was subsequently booked onto another flight and left Bozeman later that evening, Humphrey said.
Our PSO didn’t realize he was dealing with Senator Cruz until after the fact," he said.

     Ted Cruz Rails at Montana Airport Employees: 'Do You Know Who I Am?'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) continues to disgrace the surname of Cruz with his assholery.
This time, the Cancun-loving senator, to whom I am not related, was so unruly and rude to airport staff at Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport on Sunday that police had to be summoned.
AdvertisementIn a video posted to the Bozeman subreddit, Cruz is seen arguing with employees after he missed his flight check-in.
It’s unclear why he was in Montana in the first place, though we know he loves an ill-timed vacation.
Second, Cruz needed to get out of Montana because he had a confirmation hearing to attend on Monday morning.

     ‘Frustrated’ Ted Cruz’s exchange with Montana airport staff caught on camera
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An airport public safety officer was “asked to assist with a frustrated passenger” when Texas Senator Ted Cruz missed his flight out of Montana on Sunday, a Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport official told the Daily Mail.
Cruz’s exchange with airport staff, which garnered national attention and became a punchline for late-night talk show hosts, was recorded by a bystander and posted on Reddit.
“One of our Public Safety Officers (PSO) was in the ticket lobby and was asked to assist with a frustrated passenger at the United ticket counter (which is not unusual),” Humphrey told the media outlet.
The video does not capture what Cruz was telling airport staff.
He returned to Washington D.C. in time for the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of federal judge Kentanji Brown Jackson.

     Summary: Play video contentSenator Ted Cruz apparently got a little spicy with some airport employees this weekend -- so much so, in fact, that a police officer had to step in and calm him down.
The eyewitness claims they overheard Sen. Cruz getting all 'Karen' on the airline employees ... allegedly asking for names and to speak with their manager.
Push didn't come to shove, though, and all's well that ends well ... with TC reportedly getting rebooked without further incident.
Sen. Ted Cruz to Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson: "No one is going to inquire into your teenage dating habits.
Seems like his mood might've been influenced by his FUBAR trip 24 hours earlier.

Journalist and author Grant Stern wrote: "Ted Cruz is flipping out in a Montana airport, probably because he's not in Cancun's more spacious, warm airport."
Rick Wilson, co-founder of the Lincoln Project, added: "Ted Cruz getting aggro with airline counter folks is so very on-brand."
