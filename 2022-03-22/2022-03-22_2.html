     Amanda Bynes, Former Child Star, Is Released From Conservatorship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A judge ruled on Tuesday to end the conservatorship that for the better part of a decade has governed the life of Amanda Bynes, who shot to fame as a child star on Nickelodeon and went on to have highly publicized struggles with substance abuse.
A court in California first ordered that Ms. Bynes be put in a conservatorship — a legal arrangement typically reserved for people who are older, ailing or have disabilities — in 2013, after erratic public behavior and a series of arrests.
Over the years, Ms. Bynes’s parents have overseen her life, taking control of medical and mental health decisions and, for a time, her finances.
A judge agreed to terminate Spears’s conservatorship in November.
But Ms. Bynes’s conservatorship appeared to reach a smoother ending.

     Former child star Amanda Bynes is freed from conservatorship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amanda Bynes became famous for starring in her own Nickelodeon sketch comedy All That and The Amanda Show, the WB sitcom What I Like About You and films such as the 2010 comedy Easy A.
Esquibias says Bynes has been working on herself for years, and reporting to the court regularly and now "all of her hard work has come to fruition."
He says her mother agreed to the termination, and he filed the paperwork to end the conservatorship in February.
"But Amanda's conservatorship is nothing like Britney's conservatorship," Esquibias told NPR.
Esquibias says Bynes is excited to continue her studies at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising.

     Amanda Bynes' conservatorship terminated by judge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —A conservatorship for actress Amanda Bynes, which has been overseeing her personal and professional affairs for the past nine years, was officially ended by a judge on Tuesday.
Bynes’ mother, Lynne Bynes, had been acting as her conservator and did not object to the request filed last month.
“The parents are happy, thrilled to get this good news,” Tamar Arminak, an attorney for Bynes’ parents, told NBC last month.
Her effort to end her conservatorship comes after a judge ended Britney Spears’ 13-year conservatorship in November.
“Congratulations to Miss Bynes, and good luck,” Judge Lund said at the end of the hearing.

     Amanda Bynes conservatorship terminated after nearly 9 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A judge terminated the conservatorship of former child actor Amanda Bynes Tuesday after her petition to dissolve the arrangement was met with her parents’ full support.
Bynes, 35, has been in a personal conservatorship since 2013 following what she previously described as a dark period in her life.
A conservatorship of the estate was terminated in 2017 after her assets were moved into a trust.
The termination was filed by Bynes’ attorney at the end of February and was met with the full support of her parents, Lynn and Rick Bynes.
Bynes’ mother and personal conservator, Lynn, is particularly excited about the “next chapter” in her daughter’s life.
