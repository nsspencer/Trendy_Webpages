     Summary: For the first time in 28 years, Phil Mickelson will not participate in the Masters.
According to the Masters' website, the three-time champion of the green jacket at Augusta National Golf Club is listed under Past Champions Not Playing.
An Augusta National official confirmed to Golf Digest and ESPN that Mickelson won't be playing.
Alan Shipnuck, a journalist writing his biography, released the comments Mickelson made during a phone interview with him, which included calling the PGA Tour a dictatorship that manipulates and divides.
He also called the Saudis "scary," but would look past their history of human rights abuses, to gain leverage with the PGA Tour, ESPN reported.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Phil Mickelson is set to miss the Masters for the first time in 28 years after being removed from the tournament's list of active golfers.
The six-time major winner, who won the last of his three Masters green jackets in 2010, said last month he would take "some time away" from golf after being criticized for comments he made about Saudi Arabia's regime and the country's proposed new tourMickelson has been officially listed as a "past champion not playing" on the Masters website.
At the end of February, the 51-year-old apologized for his comments on the reported Saudi-backed breakaway golf tour, saying they were off the record -- a claim the reporter who interviewed him has denied -- and shared out of context and without his consent.
The Saudi-backed golf league is a proposed venture that is attempting to attract golfers away from the sport's main tours -- the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour -- with offers of big money.

     Summary: During the Saudi International in February, he accused the PGA Tour in a Golf Digest interview of “obnoxious greed.”But he told Shipnuck in November that “they’re scary [expletives] to get involved with.

As nice a guy as [PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan] comes across as, unless you have leverage, he won’t do what’s right.
In addition, American Express said it would no longer use Mickelson as host of its PGA Tour event and said that his foundation would no longer be its charitable arm.
“There is the problem of off-the-record comments being shared out of context and without my consent, but the bigger issue is that I used words that do not reflect my true feelings or intentions.

     Summary: Still, the entire sports world generally casts a stare at Augusta, which means it was another chance for Phil Mickelson to be a weenie and hide.
Mickelson said something truly dumb, perhaps even a shade evil, certainly tone-deaf, and egregiously selfish.
At the bottom of all this, Mickelson might have some decent points about what’s wrong with the PGA Tour for players.
It’s the one jewel Mickelson doesn’t have, having come in second six times, and wants desperately.
He’s not going to toss away maybe his last chance at a career grand slam because he’s embarrassed, right?

Mickelson did not as much withdraw from the Masters - Augusta National officials either told him or strongly encouraged him not to come, according to multiple sources.
When asked at the Players if Mickelson had been suspended, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monaghan danced around the question.
The Masters, because it is run by the powers-to-be at Augusta National and not the PGA Tour, has the ability to invite – or disinvite – whoever it wants.

“I think Phil has been a wonderful ambassador for the game of golf, still is a wonderful ambassador for the game of golf.
