The star quarterback took part in Liberty's pro day as he looks to continue improving his stock for the 2022 NFL draft.
The workout seemed designed to showcase Willis' arm talent, especially accuracy on deep balls.

     Summary: Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin took a break from his tour of Power 5 campuses on Tuesday in his NFL draft prep to stop by Liberty University on Tuesday to get another look at quarterback Malik Willis.
The Steelers signed quarterback Mitch Trubisky this offseason as a bridge starter but it’s good to see Tomlin is still keeping his eyes on the big picture with a player like Willis.
In a league where blending athleticism and arm talent, Willis is the best of the bunch in this draft.

     Summary: If the Carolina Panthers are ultimately choosing between Kenny Pickett and Malik Willis in this year’s draft, they’ll be choosing between two pretty different flavors.
So, to help prevent potential uncertainty or indecisiveness over what they want to order, the team sent the house again on Tuesday.
24 hours after filing into Pittsburgh for Pickett’s pro day, the Panthers had all of their top decision-makers present to see Willis’ showcase at the Liberty University practice facility.

But if that gets any clearer, with the big-armed passer having absolutely ripped during his throwing drills, that sixth spot might be too late for them to even grab him.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite acquiring former Pro Bowler Mitchell Trubisky last week, the Steelers are clearly still open to using their first-round pick on another quarterback.
On Monday, Pittsburgh's brass stayed in town to check out Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett's pro day.
On Tuesday, Colbert, head coach Mike Tomlin and offensive coordinator Matt Canada were among Pittsburgh's contingent who traveled to Liberty to take in Malik Willis' pro day.
By all accounts, Willis enjoyed a successful Pro Day while showcasing his ability to connect on deep passes.
Half of our experts have the Steelers using the pick on former Cincinnati quarterback Desmond Ritter, who this past fall led the Bearcats to an undefeated regular season.
