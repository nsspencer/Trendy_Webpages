     Woman Is Charged in Shoving Death of Broadway Singing Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After she pushed an elderly woman down and left her bleeding on the pavement, Lauren Pazienza took the train home to her apartment in Queens, the authorities said.
She left her cellphone with an aunt and went to stay at her parents’ house in Long Island, the authorities said.
But street cameras had captured her face, and, after the police circulated the images, an employee at her building in Astoria identified her, they said.
Officers showed up at her parents’ home, and, with the police closing in, she surrendered on Tuesday, almost two weeks after the assault.
Ms. Pazienza, 26, was charged with manslaughter and ordered held on $500,000 cash bail or a $1 million bond as her family looked on in the courtroom.

     26-year-old woman charged with manslaughter in fatal shoving of 87-year-old Broadway vocal coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A 26-year-old woman was charged Tuesday with one count of first-degree manslaughter and two counts of second-degree assault in connection with the death of an 87-year-old woman who was fatally shoved in New York City earlier this month, according to a criminal complaint.
The charges stem from the death of Barbara Maier Gustern, a Broadway vocal coach, who police said was pushed from behind by a woman on the night of March 10 as she stood outside her apartment in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood.
Lauren Pazienza, the accused woman, was arraigned Tuesday afternoon.
She did not enter a plea, according to Naomi Puzzello and Caitlyn Fowles, spokespeople for the Manhattan DA's Office.
There was "no apparent reason" for the alleged attack, the criminal complaint said.

"Instead of a priest, Pazienza cried in front of a judge as bail was set at half a million dollars cash for alleged manslaughter.
"She crossed the street, shouted something derogatory at my grandmother, and pushed her down," he said.
Gustern says he tried to imagine who the suspect would turn-out to be.
Like what really got to me was finding pictures of her smiling in art galleries, dressed nicely with other people.
