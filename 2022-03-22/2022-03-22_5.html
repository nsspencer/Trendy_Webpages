     Ex-wife of Missouri GOP Senate candidate Eric Greitens accuses him of domestic violence

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eric Greitens, Missouri’s former governor and current Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, has been accused by his ex-wife Sheena Greitens of allegedly being physically abusive and “unstable,” according to court records filed on Monday.
Sheena Greitens and Eric Greitens have been part of an ongoing child custody battle.
Eric Greitens is looking to succeed retiring Republican Senator Roy Blunt in his bid for U.S. Senate.
Also in the field are Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, Representatives Billy Long and Vicky Hartzler.
Hartzler, Schmitt, Long and Lucas Kunce, a Marine and Democratic candidate in the race, have called for Greitens to drop out of the U.S. Senate race.

     Eric Greitens Allegations Could Wreck GOP Chances of Taking Back Senate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New allegations against U.S. Senate candidate and former Missouri Governor Eric Greitens could wreck the Republican Party's chances of retaking the Senate in November.
Several Republicans have urged Greitens to drop out of the race to replace Republican Senator Roy Blunt, who is retiring.
Both Hawley and Ernst previously endorsed one of Greiten's Republican primary opponents, Representative Vicky Hartzler of Missouri's 4th congressional district.
In a statement on Monday, Greitens called his ex-wife's accusations "completely fabricated, baseless allegations" and said he would seek full custody of his sons.
Newsweek has asked the Eric Greitens campaign for comment.

     New Eric Greitens abuse allegations reignite GOP fears of losing Missouri Senate seat • Missouri Independent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The prospect of Eric Greitens capturing the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in Missouri was already terrifying to his party’s leaders.
Those fears seemed to be confirmed on Monday, when the former governor’s ex-wife accused him of physically abusing her and his children.
The news rocked the already chaotic GOP Senate primary, where multiple candidates have been jockeying for position in the hopes of being the party’s Greitens alternative.
So did U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, who has long feuded with his fellow Missouri Republican and was among the first prominent elected officials to call for him to step down in 2018.
Meanwhile in Missouri, the 41-page affidavit from Greitens’ ex-wife now hangs like a shadow over the Senate primary.

     Summary: The accusations are included in a sworn affidavit filed by former Missouri First Lady Sheena Greitens as part of an ongoing child custody dispute.
“I started sleeping in my children’s room simply to try to keep them safe,” Sheena Greitens said in the affidavit.
Eric Greitens’ attorney, Gary Stamper, filed a motion Monday requesting the case’s records be immediately sealed.
Moving the case to Texas would mitigate the reach of Eric Greitens’ power and influence and the impact of personal attacks, Sheen Greitens attests.
