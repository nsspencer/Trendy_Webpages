     U.S., NATO believe Belarus could "soon" join Russia's war against Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. and NATO officials say there are indications that Belarus is taking steps to join the war Russia is waging against Ukraine.
It is increasingly "likely" that Belarus will enter the conflict, a NATO military official said on Monday.
A senior NATO intelligence official said separately that the alliance assesses that the Belarusian government "is preparing the environment to justify a Belarusian offensive against Ukraine."
The NATO military official said that a final decision for Belarus' involvement in the war still has to be made in Moscow, as of yet there has been no indication that Belarusian forces are participating in the fighting in Ukraine.
The official wouldn't elaborate on how Belarus could intervene in the war, but said it made sense for Russia to try and cut off NATO military aid coming into Ukraine from its Western border.

     Capitol riot suspect is granted refugee status in Belarus after fleeing US
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A US Capitol riot suspect who fled the United States has been granted refugee status in Belarus, according to Belarusian state-owned television BelTA.
The California man, Evan Neumann, went to Europe after being charged in connection with the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
BelTA wrote on social media that Neumann had been forced to leave the US because of "politically motivated charges."
BelTA also posted images of Neumann with a government official, shaking hands and holding his new travel documents.
A federal grand jury in Washington indicted Neumann in December on 14 charges, including assaulting a police officer and engaging in physical violence on Capitol grounds.

     Summary: Evan Neumann, who was indicted on 14 counts in relation to the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, has received refugee status in Belarus.
Video footage from the riot showed what appeared to be Neumann wearing a gas mask, according to a December release from the Department of Justice.
After taking off the mask, the man began "verbally abusing" law enforcement officers protecting the Capitol building.
Neumann told a Belarusian TV station he fled the U.S. in March 2021 under advice from his lawyer, traveling through Europe to get to Ukraine, where he lived for several months, CBS News reported.
He told Gazeta that while he feels "calm" and likes it in Belarus, he has "mixed feelings" about being there.

     Summary: Wojtek Jargiło/PAPBelarus is closing the Brzugi migrant camp near the Kuznica crossing point and the remaining migrants are being pushed towards the Polish border, the Polish Border Guard has reported.
The Brzugi camp lies close to the site that was the epicentre of clashes last year between Polish Border Guards and police and migrants desperate to get into Poland.
Belarusians are taking people from there and pushing them towards the Polish side," Lieutenant Anna Michalska, a Border Guard spokeswoman, told PAP.
On Tuesday, the press service of the Belarusian State Border Committee announced that there were no more immigrants at the centre, and that it was no longer necessary.
On Tuesday, the Border Guard tweeted that over the past 24 hours as many as 134 people attempted to get to Poland illegally from Belarus, the highest figure since the start of the year.

     Will Belarus, Russia’s key ally, join Putin’s war in Ukraine?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Analysts say President Lukashenko’s forces may spearhead the Russian advance on western Ukrainian regions.
Vinnytsia, Ukraine – When Belarus, Russia’s oldest and staunchest post-Soviet ally, evacuated its embassy from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Saturday, the ambassador received a humiliating “gift”.
He said this would follow weeks of purges within the Belarusian military after many servicemen and officers refused to fight Ukrainians.
Belarus has beefed up its forces along the Ukrainian border, although its top commander claimed it had nothing to do with the possibility of their participation in the war.
But militarily, it will be a problem – whether Belarusians only concentrate on helping Russians take over Kyiv, or help them subjugate western Ukraine.
