“But at this point, the company needs to do better.
They have a long ways to go towards gaining our trust back.”

     Summary: Disney workers walk out over the company's response to so-called 'Don't Say Gay' billEnlarge this image toggle caption John Raoux/AP John Raoux/APSome employees of The Walt Disney Company walked off the job Tuesday to protest what they said was the company's tepid response to a Florida bill that would restrict discussion of gender and sexuality in schools.
Hundreds of employees were seen marching out of the company's headquarters in Burbank, Calif., Tuesday morning, according to CNBC field producer Steve Desaulniers.
"The recent statements by The Walt Disney Company (TWDC) leadership regarding the Florida legislature's recent 'Don't Say Gay' bill have utterly failed to match the magnitude of the threat to LGBTQIA+ safety represented by this legislation," an open letter by Disney employees reads.
What the employees wantEmployees are calling for Disney to stop making political donations to certain Florida politicians – including Gov.
DeSantis has also called Disney a "woke" corporation for opposing the bill.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LGBTQ workers and employee allies at The Walt Disney Company staged a walkout in protest of Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed the "Don't Say Gay" bill by opponents.
Opponents of the bill say it would shame and silence LGBTQ youth and could have major negative consequences on their mental health.
"We are hard at work creating a new framework for our political giving that will ensure our advocacy better reflects our values," Chapek said in an email to Disney employees.
Several Disney companies have released statements of support on social media amid the March 22 walkout, including ABC News, Disney Plus, Walt Disney World, Pixar and more.
The Walt Disney Company is the parent company of ABC News.

     How LGBTQ Disney walkout could impact Disneyland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disney employees taking part in the walkout on Tuesday, March 22 are encouraged not to work while on the job or call in sick and stay home for the day, according to the Disney Do Better Walkout website.
The walkouts are an opportunity for Disney’s LGBTQ employees to take a stand against the company’s “apathy” in response to the Florida legislation, according to the Disney Do Better Walkout website.
The LGBTQ Disney Walkout is unlikely to result in employee protests in the “on stage” areas of the parks, but the associated work stoppages and sick-outs could result in longer than usual lines for attractions and food stands at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure.
The group organizing the walkouts appears to be unaffiliated with any external unions representing Disney employees or internal employee groups representing LGBTQ cast members, Disney parlance for employees.
A Florida union representing thousands of Disney World workers warned against taking part in the company boycott, saying there were more effective ways to push for change and help LGBTQ Disney employees, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

     Disney employees across the U.S. are walking out today. Here's why.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "It was amazing to see everyone out here in support of all of our queer employees and their families," said Nora Rogers, a production supervisor at Walt Disney Animation Studios.
Throughout the day, several Disney employees also expressed solidarity with the protesters on social media.
The corporation's position on the bill appeared to be especially galling to some of the tens of thousands of Disney employees in Florida, home to the sprawling Walt Disney World theme park and resort in Orlando.
LGBTQ employees started making plans for a series of protests during breaks, culminating in the general walkout Tuesday.
Advocates march at a rally at the Walt Disney Company in Orlando, Fla., spearheaded by advocates from AIDS Healthcare Foundation on March 3, 2022.

     Disney in Balancing Act as Some Workers Walk Out in Protest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Throughout the day, pockets of employees staged demonstrations at various sites across the country, including near Orlando’s Walt Disney World and Walt Disney Animation Studios in California.
Disney employed 190,000 workers last October, with roughly three-quarters working in its theme parks division.
The debate forced the company into a balancing act between the expectations of a diverse workforce and demands from an increasingly polarized, politicized marketplace.
Republican lawmakers pushing the Florida legislation argued that parents, not teachers, should be the ones talking to their children about gender issues during their early formative years.
About 20 Disney workers gathered at New York City’s Stonewall Inn, birthplace of the gay rights movement, to write letters in support of families affected by the Florida legislation.
