     Disney workers walk out over the company's response to so-called 'Don't Say Gay' bill

     Summary: Disney workers walk out over the company's response to so-called 'Don't Say Gay' billEnlarge this image toggle caption John Raoux/AP John Raoux/APSome employees of The Walt Disney Company walked off the job Tuesday to protest what they said was the company's tepid response to a Florida bill that would restrict discussion of gender and sexuality in schools.
Hundreds of employees were seen marching out of the company's headquarters in Burbank, Calif., Tuesday morning, according to CNBC field producer Steve Desaulniers.
"The recent statements by The Walt Disney Company (TWDC) leadership regarding the Florida legislature's recent 'Don't Say Gay' bill have utterly failed to match the magnitude of the threat to LGBTQIA+ safety represented by this legislation," an open letter by Disney employees reads.
What the employees wantEmployees are calling for Disney to stop making political donations to certain Florida politicians – including Gov.
DeSantis has also called Disney a "woke" corporation for opposing the bill.

     Disney responds to planned 'Don't Say Gay' bill walkout at Walt Disney World
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Walt Disney Company responded to a planned walkout of LGBTQ workers on Tuesday.
The walkout comes after Disney remained publicly silent on the controversial bill barring discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in Florida schools.
CEO Bob Chapek revealed that he had worked behind-the-scenes to influence legislators against the bill, though he admitted his strategy was flawed after the bill passed.
Walkout organizers took credit for the turn in Disney's messaging, saying it was the result of their own work with corporate higher-ups.
They were tirelessly advocated for by our own LGBTQIA+ co-workers to show support today," they wrote on Twitter.

     How LGBTQ Disney walkout could impact Disneyland
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Disney employees taking part in the walkout on Tuesday, March 22 are encouraged not to work while on the job or call in sick and stay home for the day, according to the Disney Do Better Walkout website.
The walkouts are an opportunity for Disney’s LGBTQ employees to take a stand against the company’s “apathy” in response to the Florida legislation, according to the Disney Do Better Walkout website.
The LGBTQ Disney Walkout is unlikely to result in employee protests in the “on stage” areas of the parks, but the associated work stoppages and sick-outs could result in longer than usual lines for attractions and food stands at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure.
The group organizing the walkouts appears to be unaffiliated with any external unions representing Disney employees or internal employee groups representing LGBTQ cast members, Disney parlance for employees.
A Florida union representing thousands of Disney World workers warned against taking part in the company boycott, saying there were more effective ways to push for change and help LGBTQ Disney employees, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

     Disney Finds Itself in Balancing Act With Walkout Actions

A half-dozen Disney workers gathered Tuesday morning at an LGBTQ center near downtown Orlando to write letters in support of queer students.
Republican lawmakers pushing the Florida legislation had argued that parents, not teachers, should be the ones talking to their children about gender issues during their early formative years.
Power, the Tallahassee GOP official, said he's confident that Disney and Florida Republicans will get past this flashpoint and restore their relationship.
