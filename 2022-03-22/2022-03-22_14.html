     Megan Thee Stallion's Latest Legal Battle With Carl Crawford Is Yet Another Cautionary Tale For Artists
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Megan Thee Stallion and Carl Crawford are serving us a learning lesson right before our eyes.
Crawford, who recently filed a countersuit against the “Tina Snow” rapper, has taken umbrage with his artist’s filing of a lawsuit against his label, 1501 Certified Entertainment, and has slapped her with a countersuit.
If you believe Carl Crawford, she did not.
“This is yet another absurd attempt by 1501 to disregard Megan’s album and squeeze more money and more free work out of her for as long as possible,” said Brad Hancock, the lawyer for Megan Thee Stallion.
Aside from this all being a cautionary tale for artists who sign predatory record deals, we decided to take a look at the facts of the case to see whether Megan Thee Stallion or Carl Crawford could, ultimately, prevail.
