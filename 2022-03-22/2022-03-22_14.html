    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Reuters) – San Francisco-based Okta Inc, a widely used access management company that competes with the likes of PingID and Duo to provide online authentication services, said it was investigating a digital breach on Tuesday.
Okta said the breach could be connected to an earlier incident in January.
Okta sells identity services, such as Single Sign-On and Multi-factor Authentication used to log in to online applications and websites.
Hundreds of large companies, such as FedEx Corp, T-Mobile US Inc, Moody’s Corp and Coinbase Global Inc, use Okta’s services.
Global cloud services provider Cloudflare Inc also uses Okta.

     Okta confirms January breach after hackers publish screenshots of its internal network – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Identity giant Okta has confirmed a January security incident after hackers posted screenshots overnight apparently showing access to the company’s internal systems.
The Lapsus$ hacking group published several screenshots to its Telegram channel purporting to show internal Okta applications, Jira bug ticketing system, and the company’s Slack on January 21.
Lapsus$ claimed it did not steal data from Okta, and that its focus was on targeting Okta customers.
Just this week Microsoft said it was investigating a possible security breach.
If you know more about the Okta breach or work at the company, get in touch with the security desk on Signal at +1 646-755-8849 or zack.whittaker@techcrunch.com by email.

     Lapsus$ group claims Okta supply chain attacks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lapsus$ extortion group posted screenshots to its Telegram channel Monday night they say prove they breached identity management vendor Okta.
The group said the Okta breach was not intended to get data from Okta, but instead leverage the access to Okta to attack Okta clients.
After posting screenshots, Lapsus$ claimed in an all-capital-letters update, that Okta was breached not for its own data, but as a supply chain attack.
According to Brett Callow, a ransom group expert with Emsisoft, any Lapsus$ claims should be taken with a professional criminal-sized grain of salt.
"None of Lapsus$' claims should be taken at face value," he said via electronic chat.

     Okta investigating reports of possible digital breach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Okta, an identity authentication service with more than 15,000 customers, said Tuesday that an attacker had access to a support engineer's laptop for five days in January.
The Okta service that customers use to authenticate logins "has not been breached and remains fully operational," Okta Chief Security Officer David Bradbury said in a blog post Tuesday.
The new details came hours after Okta said it was investigating reports of a possible digital breach.
Reuters first reported that Okta was looking into reports of a possible digital breach after a hacking group known as Lapsus$ claimed responsibility for the incident and published screenshots claiming access to an Okta internal administrative account and the firm's Slack channel.
Lapsus$, a mysterious hacking group that emerged in December, claimed on the messaging app Telegram that it did not steal any databases from Okta itself, but that "our focus was ONLY on Okta customers."

     Okta Hack? Customers Scramble as Okta Tries to Clarify Breach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The digital extortion group Lapsus$ threw the security world into disarray on Monday with claims that it had gained access to a “super user” administrative account for the identity management platform Okta.
Since so many organizations use Okta as the gatekeeper to their suite of cloud services, such an attack could have major ramifications for any number of Okta customers.
“There are two big unknowns when it comes to the Okta incident: the specific nature of the incident and how it might impact Okta customers,” says Keith McCammon, chief security officer at the network security and incident-response firm Red Canary.
The timing coincides with Lapsus$'s decision to release screenshots, via Telegram, that claim to detail its Okta administrative account access from late January.
The latter is the main mechanism Lapsus$ hackers would likely have abused to take over Okta logins at target organizations and infiltrate.

That’s among the best debuts we’ve seen in some time — and could help other private companies look toward an exit of their own.

     Okta hack puts thousands of businesses on high alert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Any hack of Okta could have major ramifications for the companies, universities, and government agencies that depend upon Okta to authenticate user access to internal systems.
Support engineers do have access to limited data - for example, Jira tickets and lists of users - that were seen in the screenshots.
Support engineers are also able to facilitate the resetting of passwords and MFA factors for users, but are unable to obtain those passwords.
Okta says it terminated its support engineer’s Okta sessions and suspended the account back in January, but claims it only received the final report from its forensics firm this week.
Update, 2:38PM ET: Added Okta’s statement and claims that the hack was very limited, with no corrective actions that need to be taken.
