     Houston Texans must go after Za’Darius Smith to balance AFC South Powers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Baltimore Ravens’ loss could be the Houston Texans’ treasure.
Za’Darius Smith has been one of the better pass rushers in NFL for the last few seasons.
As a result, Smith is once again a free agent, and the Houston Texans and Lovie Smith should be calling Smith’s agent right now.
Houston Texans need pass rush help with Matt Ryan in the AFC SouthWhen the Colts struck a deal for Matt Ryan, it was an incredible value.
Regardless, Smith would be the perfect counter-attack to help the Texans in their climb out of the basement.

     Vikings Twitter explodes after Za'Darius Smith signing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Minnesota Vikings fans have been on the edge of their seats ever since it was announced that two-time Pro Bowl outside linebacker Za’Darius Smith was in town for a visit.
The thought of Smith joining Danielle Hunter and creating one of the best one-two punch combos in the NFL had SKOL nation begging the football gods to move mountains, manifest miracles and basically, do whatever it took to ensure a deal went through.
Now, the former Green Bay Packer will be wearing purple in 2022 after agreeing to a three-year, $42 million deal with the Vikings.
The pipe dream of a Smith and Hunter defensive combo has become a reality.
After a relatively quiet free agency, Vikings fans were ready to unleash after hearing news of the deal on Tuesday.

     Za’Darius Smith signs with Vikings for 3 years, $42 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Once more, the Minnesota Vikings have elected to sign a player who was cast off by the Green Bay Packers.
After decades of seeing players jump from Green Bay to Minneapolis, the trend continued anew on Tuesday with former Packers edge rusher Za’Darius Smith.
After initially appearing to agree to a 4-year, $35 million contract to return to the Baltimore Ravens, where he played prior to signing in Green Bay, Smith elected to back out, apparently with good reason.
Today, he has reportedly signed a three-year contract with the Vikings worth $42 million with another $5 million in possible incentives.
Smith will have a chance to rejoin former Packers defensive coaches Mike Pettine and Mike Smith.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having backed out of a contract with the Ravens, Za'Darius Smith will be getting a lot of money from the Vikings to sack Aaron Rodgers.
GREEN BAY, Wis. – If Za’Darius Smith was a source of frustration for the Green Bay Packers in 2021, just wait until 2022.
Because the Packers released Za’Darius Smith, they will not gain a compensatory draft pick next offseason.
After opening his career in Baltimore, Za’Darius Smith joined the Packers in 2019 on a monster four-year, $66 million contract.
Za’Darius Smith sought motivation anywhere and everywhere.

     Vikings signing former Packers OLB Za'Darius Smith to three-year, $42M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a tumultuous free agency period, Za'Darius Smith is back in the NFC North.
After being released by the Green Bay Packers, Smith initially agreed to a four-year, $35 million deal (worth a max of $50 million) to return to Baltimore.
The okey-doke netted Smith a bigger payday.
It's a boom-or-bust signing for the Vikings, who desperately needed a talent infusion on defense this offseason.
Pairing Smith with Danielle Hunter gives Minnesota two dynamic edge rushers who can win one-on-ones.

     Summary: "They were like these four guys right here [were] in the Pro Bowl at the time.
I don't know too many people [who] come back from back surgery," Smith added.
Smith will hope to recapture the form he had in 2019 and 2020 when he earned back-to-back Pro Bowl honors and terrorized the rest of the league.
He recorded careers highs in sacks (13.5) and tackles for loss (17) in 2019 to make his first Pro Bowl.
Smith followed that up with another Pro Bowl season with 12.5 sacks, also earning Second-Team All-Pro honors from The Associated Press.
