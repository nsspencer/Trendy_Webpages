     As Belarus' Ambassador Left Ukraine, a Biting Gift
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Newser) – The indications that Belarus will join Russia in its war against Ukraine may be building.
Belarus, which al-Jazeera calls "Russia’s oldest and staunchest post-Soviet ally," has removed all its diplomats from Ukraine in the past few days.
To that end, a NATO official on Monday told CNN that it's getting more "likely" that Belarus will join Russia's side in Ukraine.
He tells al-Jazeera the likely goal would be to help Putin seize Kyiv; Russia convoys and troops are already closing in on Kyiv from Belarusian soil.
The NATO official tells CNN the final say on the move rests with Putin: "It is not about what [Belarusian President Alexander] Lukashenko wants.

     Belarus Economy: What to Know
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Belarus, which lies just to the north of Ukraine, has been targeted by sanctions for its participation in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
As the world watches "White Russia" for its next moves, here are some things to know about Belarus and its economy.
Belarus’ main industrial sectors include energy, agriculture and forestry, construction, and the services sector, which accounted for nearly half of the country’s GDP in 2019.
Belarus’ population has been declining since the fall of the Soviet Union.
It began to decline after the fall of the Soviet Union, dropping from 71 in 1989 to 68 in 2002.

     Will Belarus, Russia’s key ally, join Putin’s war in Ukraine?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Analysts say President Lukashenko’s forces may spearhead the Russian advance on western Ukrainian regions.
Vinnytsia, Ukraine – When Belarus, Russia’s oldest and staunchest post-Soviet ally, evacuated its embassy from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Saturday, the ambassador received a humiliating “gift”.
He said this would follow weeks of purges within the Belarusian military after many servicemen and officers refused to fight Ukrainians.
Belarus has beefed up its forces along the Ukrainian border, although its top commander claimed it had nothing to do with the possibility of their participation in the war.
But militarily, it will be a problem – whether Belarusians only concentrate on helping Russians take over Kyiv, or help them subjugate western Ukraine.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington CNN —The US and NATO believe that Belarus could “soon” join Russia in its war against Ukraine, US and NATO officials tell CNN, and that the country is already taking steps to do so.
It is increasingly “likely” that Belarus will enter the conflict, a NATO military official said on Monday.
A Belarusian opposition source said that Belarusian combat units are ready to go into Ukraine as soon as in the next few days, with thousands of forces prepared to deploy.
US and European sanctions in response to the war have targeted both Russian and Belarusian officials, including Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
“The question is: does Putin want another unstable country in the region?”“Involvement would destabilize Belarus,” the official said.

     Ukraine Fears ‘Europe’s Last Dictator’ 'Will Join the Russian Invasion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KYIV, Ukraine – The Ukrainian army is preparing for an imminent invasion by Belarus into its territory.
Russian fighter jets have been taking off from Belarusian airfields to bomb targets in Ukraine, and Belarus is serving as a launching ground for rocket attacks.
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the Belarus opposition leader in exile, also said Tuesday that the Belarusian army was preparing to invade.
This was just one of a number of similar firings of senior officers in the Russian military and intelligence apparatus since the invasion began.
Mizenetsev was also a commander of the Russian forces that were deployed to Syria in 2015 and helped the Assad regime bombard Aleppo before retaking it.
