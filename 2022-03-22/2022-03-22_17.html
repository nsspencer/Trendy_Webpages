     Eric Greitens Allegations Could Wreck GOP Chances of Taking Back Senate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New allegations against U.S. Senate candidate and former Missouri Governor Eric Greitens could wreck the Republican Party's chances of retaking the Senate in November.
Several Republicans have urged Greitens to drop out of the race to replace Republican Senator Roy Blunt, who is retiring.
Both Hawley and Ernst previously endorsed one of Greiten's Republican primary opponents, Representative Vicky Hartzler of Missouri's 4th congressional district.
In a statement on Monday, Greitens called his ex-wife's accusations "completely fabricated, baseless allegations" and said he would seek full custody of his sons.
Newsweek has asked the Eric Greitens campaign for comment.

     New Eric Greitens abuse allegations reignite GOP fears of losing Missouri Senate seat • Missouri Independent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The prospect of Eric Greitens capturing the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in Missouri was already terrifying to his party’s leaders.
Those fears seemed to be confirmed on Monday, when the former governor’s ex-wife accused him of physically abusing her and his children.
The news rocked the already chaotic GOP Senate primary, where multiple candidates have been jockeying for position in the hopes of being the party’s Greitens alternative.
So did U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, who has long feuded with his fellow Missouri Republican and was among the first prominent elected officials to call for him to step down in 2018.
Meanwhile in Missouri, the affidavit from Greitens’ ex-wife now hangs like a shadow over the Senate primary.
