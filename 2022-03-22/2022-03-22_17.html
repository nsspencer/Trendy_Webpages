     Ex-wife of Missouri GOP Senate candidate Eric Greitens accuses him of domestic violence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Eric Greitens, Missouri’s former governor and current Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, has been accused by his ex-wife Sheena Greitens of allegedly being physically abusive and “unstable,” according to court records filed on Monday.
Sheena Greitens and Eric Greitens have been part of an ongoing child custody battle.
Eric Greitens is looking to succeed retiring Republican Senator Roy Blunt in his bid for U.S. Senate.
Also in the field are Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, Representatives Billy Long and Vicky Hartzler.
Hartzler, Schmitt, Long and Lucas Kunce, a Marine and Democratic candidate in the race, have called for Greitens to drop out of the U.S. Senate race.

     New Eric Greitens abuse allegations reignite GOP fears of losing Missouri Senate seat • Missouri Independent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The prospect of Eric Greitens capturing the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in Missouri was already terrifying to his party’s leaders.
Those fears seemed to be confirmed on Monday, when the former governor’s ex-wife accused him of physically abusing her and his children.
The news rocked the already chaotic GOP Senate primary, where multiple candidates have been jockeying for position in the hopes of being the party’s Greitens alternative.
So did U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, who has long feuded with his fellow Missouri Republican and was among the first prominent elected officials to call for him to step down in 2018.
Meanwhile in Missouri, the affidavit from Greitens’ ex-wife now hangs like a shadow over the Senate primary.
