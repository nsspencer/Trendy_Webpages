     Look: Zion Williamson Appears To Be Getting Healthy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zion Williamson’s injury situation seems to be greatly improving.
On Tuesday evening, the injured star posted a video showing off some of the unreal athleticism that endeared him to NBA fans as the No.
Zion just posted this on his Instagram story pic.twitter.com/bvZ4hJk3uJ — Jack Settleman (@jacksettleman) March 23, 2022This video comes just one day after NBA insider Shams Charania reported that Zion will not return this season.
Zion suffered a broken foot injury during an offseason workout before the 2021-22 season.
Hopefully this clip means Zion will be back at full health for the 2022-23 season.

     New Orleans Pelicans' Zion Williamson posts dunk video amid ongoing rehab for foot
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zion Williamson throws it to himself off the backboard for an impressive dunk as he continues to rehab from a foot injury.
(0:16)New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson has tried to keep a low profile on social media while rehabbing a fractured right foot that has kept him out the entire 2021-22 season.
Williamson returned to the New Orleans area on March 5 after spending two months in Portland continuing his rehab.
During the portions of practice that have been open to the media, Williamson has done just some light shooting -- without jumping -- with his player development coaches.
It was announced Williamson suffered the fracture at media day in September, when there was optimism from both the front office and Williamson himself that he could be ready for the start of the regular season.

     With the Zion Williamson question answered, Pelicans can move on
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Pelicans have had the Zion Williamson question lingering over them all season, but it appears it may have finally been answered.
“Will Zion Williamson play this year?” has unfortunately been the key narrative of the 2021-22 season for the Pelicans, a question that is close to being answered.
According to Shams Charania of the Athletic, Zion is unlikely to play at all this season.
The Pelicans can move on this season without Zion WilliamsonI thought the Pelicans would make the play-in with or without Zion Williamson and that was before they added CJ McCollum to the team.
It’s not the news we wanted, as I truly think this is a championship-caliber team at full strength, but the Pelicans can now move on with their season without the question of Zion’s return lingering over everything.

     Zion Williamson posts shirtless video doing between-the-legs alley-oop dunk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zion Williamson has not played a game this season as he’s recovered from a fractured foot.
It’s an obvious decision for a Pelicans team that has crawled out of a 1-12 start to put themselves in position to make the play-in game.
A day later, he posted a video of himself doing an under-the-legs dunk from a lob off the backboard — while shirtless.
Charania reported that Williamson is doing stationary shooting drills and can put weight on his leg.
The Pelicans are already a really fun team — we can’t wait to see what they look like with Zion next season.

     Duke in the NBA: Kyrie Irving drops 60, Zion Williamson out for the season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets faced the Orlando Magic on the road Wednesday with Irving able to join them.
With such an on-off season, one might expect Irving to need time to adjust between rest and playing.
That is the most points scored in a half in NBA league history since Kobe Bryant scored 42 for the Lakers in 2003.
Carter was traded from the Chicago Bulls to the Orlando Magic midway through last season, making this season his first full-length one with the Magic.
At one point in the quarter, Carter scored seven straight to help the Magic take the lead back from the Thunder.

     Zion Williamson injury update: Not expected to return at all this season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Sean Gardner/Getty Images)New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson will likely miss the entirety of his third season in the NBA.
Fast forward nearly six months to today and Zion has yet to play in an NBA game this season, and The Athletic’s Shams Charania has reported that Williamson is not expected to return at all.
But it’s a huge bummer nevertheless to see the 2021-22 NBA season completely robbed of one of its premiere signature young talents.
Even before last season, Zion was a revelation.
That is the most by any player through their first 60 career games since Michael Jordan (52 of first 60).

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Will we see Zion Williamson take the floor this season?
That’s the question, not only of every single fan of the New Orleans Pelicans but of the entire NBA as well.
Still, it looks like Zion is well on his way to full recovery from his foot injury.
While Zion still looks a little chunky than usual, it’s great to see his athleticism hasn’t waned.
While the Pelicans’ season hasn’t gone exactly as planned with all the roster setbacks, their high-scoring trio of Zion, Brandon Ingram, and CJ McCollum will be a scary one.
