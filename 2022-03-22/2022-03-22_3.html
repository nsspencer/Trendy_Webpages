     Authentication firm Okta probes report of digital breach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Authentication services provider Okta Inc. is investigating a report of a digital breach, the company said on Tuesday, after hackers posted screenshots showing what they claimed was its internal company environment.
In a statement, Okta official Chris Hollis said the breach could be related to an earlier incident in January, which was contained.
Okta had detected an attempt to compromise the account of a third party customer support engineer at the time, said Hollis.
The screenshots were posted by a group of ransom-seeking hackers known as LAPSUS$ on their Telegram channel late on Monday.
Dan Tentler, the founder of cybersecurity consultancy Phobos Group, said he too believed the breach was real and urged Okta customers to be “very vigilant right now.”

     Okta confirms January breach after hackers publish screenshots of its internal network – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Identity giant Okta has confirmed a January network breach after hackers posted screenshots overnight apparently showing access to the company’s internal systems.
The Lapsus$ hacking group published several screenshots to its Telegram channel purporting to show internal Okta applications on January 21.
TechCrunch could not immediately verify the authenticity of the screenshots posted by Lapsus$.
Just this week Microsoft said it was investigating a possible security breach.

     Here’s what to know about the reported hack on Okta
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A hacking group called LAPSUS$ claimed late Monday to have breached systems belonging to Okta , a company that builds services to securely log people in to apps and networks.
Based on our investigation to date, there is no evidence of ongoing malicious activity beyond the activity detected in January.
(2 of 2)The shadowy organization released screenshots that appeared to show access to Okta internal systems, including an internal ticketing system and a Slack chat, Reuters reports .
Still, the incident likely has some Okta customers on edge, since the service is used to control access to its customers’ sensitive systems.
Matthew Prince, the CEO of hosting provider Cloudflare, tweeted that the company is resetting Okta credentials for employees who recently changed their passwords, “out of an abundance of caution,” and it seems likely that other Okta customers will be carefully looking for evidence they were further affected by any hack.

     Lapsu$ group claims Okta supply chain attacks

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lapsu$ extortion group posted screenshots to its Telegram channel Monday night they say prove they breached identity management vendor Okta.
The group said the Okta breach was not intended to get data from Okta, but instead leverage the access to Okta to attack Okta clients.
Lapsu$ Telegram post.
After posting screenshots, Lapsu$ claimed in an all-capital-letters update, that Okta was breached not for its own data, but as a supply chain attack.
According to Brett Callow, a ransom group expert with Emsisoft, any Lapsu$ claims should be taken with a professional criminal-sized grain of salt.

     Okta hack puts thousands of businesses on high alert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Any hack of Okta could have major ramifications for the companies, universities, and government agencies that depend upon Okta to authenticate user access to internal systems.
Support engineers do have access to limited data - for example, Jira tickets and lists of users - that were seen in the screenshots.
Support engineers are also able to facilitate the resetting of passwords and MFA factors for users, but are unable to obtain those passwords.
The Wall Street Journal notes that in a recent filing Okta said it had over 15,000 customers around the world.
Okta says it terminated its support engineer’s Okta sessions and suspended the account back in January, but claims it only received the final report from its forensics firm this week.
