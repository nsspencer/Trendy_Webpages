     Okta confirms January breach after hackers publish screenshots of its internal network – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Identity giant Okta has confirmed a January network breach after hackers posted screenshots overnight apparently showing access to the company’s internal systems.
The Lapsus$ hacking group published several screenshots to its Telegram channel purporting to show internal Okta applications on January 21.
TechCrunch could not immediately verify the authenticity of the screenshots posted by Lapsus$.
Just this week Microsoft said it was investigating a possible security breach.
If you know more about the Okta breach or work at the company, get in touch with the security desk on Signal at +1 646-755-8849 or zack.whittaker@techcrunch.com by email.

     Okta investigating reports of possible digital breach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Okta is investigating reports of a possible digital breach, the software company said early Tuesday.
"Okta is aware of the reports and is currently investigating," Okta spokesperson Chris Hollis told CNN in a statement.
Okta has more than 15,000 customers, according to its website.
Shares of Okta were down nearly 8% in premarket trading Tuesday.
Reuters first reported that Okta was looking into reports of a possible digital breach after a hacking group known as Lapsus$ claimed responsibility for the incident and published screenshots claiming access to an Okta internal administrative account and the firm's Slack channel.

     Authentication firm Okta says it has found no evidence of new attack after hackers claim breach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Identity management firm Okta has said it found no evidence of ongoing malicious activity after a group called Lapsus$ posted pictures claiming to have hacked the company.
Lapsus$ posted screenshots on its Telegram channel late Monday claiming it had access to a number of Okta's systems.
The hacking group said it did not access or steal any databases from Okta, but instead was focused on accessing its customers.
Based on our investigation to date, there is no evidence of ongoing malicious activity beyond the activity detected in January," the company added.
Any data breach of Okta has raised concerns that hackers could get access to other organizations using Okta's products.

     Summary: Okta, an authentication company used by thousands of organizations around the world, says it’s investigating news of a potential breach, Reuters reports.

     Okta Breached By Lapsus$, Exposing Customer Data, Group Claims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ransomware gang Lapsus$ strikes again, posting screenshots to its Telegram channel Tuesday of what it alleges is data from customers of identity security giant Okta.
Lapsus$ claims it acquired “superuser/admin” access to Okta.com and used that to access Okta’s customer data, according to screenshots posted by BleepingComputer.
Images posted to the Lapsus$ Telegram account appear to show Okta’s internal tickets and its in-house chat on the Slack messaging app, Reuters reported.
Two days before boasting about hitting Okta, Lapsus$ posted on Telegram saying it had breached internal source code repositories for Microsoft Azure DevOps.
In late February, Nvidia allegedly launched a retaliatory strike against Lapsus$ to prevent the release of the chipmaker’s stolen data, the ransomware group claimed.
