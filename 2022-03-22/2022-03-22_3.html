     Summary: Colby Covington and Jorge Masvidal appear to truly have beef.
The two UFC fighters were allegedly involved in a street brawl outside of a restaurant in Miami, Florida.
The two fought a few weeks ago back at UFC 272 where Colby Covington won by unanimous decision.
A video was shared of the UFC fighter’s location and Jorge Masvidal went to the restaurant to confront him.
Currently, it appears Masvidal would be the one in trouble with Colby Covington allegedly not throwing any strikes of his own.
