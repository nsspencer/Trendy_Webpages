     The Knicks Have Signed A New Player
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Thursday, the New York Knicks announced that they have signed Feron Hunt.
The announcement from the team can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Knicks PR.
Hunt is 22-year-old, and went undrafted out of SMU in this past summer's NBA Draft.
He played in the NBA Summer League and the preseason with the Dallas Mavericks, but did not make the regular season roster.
The Knicks are currently the 12th seed in the Eastern Conference with a 30-41 record in the 71 games that they have played in so far this season.

     New York Knicks' Julius Randle fined $40K for language toward ref, bringing season total to $130K
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK -- Knicks forward Julius Randle was penalized $40,000 by the NBA on Tuesday for directing hostile language at a referee, bringing his total to $130,000 in fines this season.
Randle engaged in lengthy conversations with the officials as well as shoving Jazz center Rudy Gobert.
Last season's winner of the Most Improved Player award has lost his emotions at times in this disappointing season for the Knicks.
The Knicks also were penalized $25,000 in January for violating league access rules when Randle refused to speak to the media.
"You're human, there's going to be emotions involved in it," Thibodeau said, "but we have to make sure we're controlling our emotions."
