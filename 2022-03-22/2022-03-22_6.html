     Woman Is Charged in Shoving Death of Broadway Singing Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After she pushed an elderly woman down and left her bleeding on the pavement, Lauren Pazienza took the train home to her apartment in Queens, the authorities said.
She left her cellphone with an aunt and went to stay at her parents’ house in Long Island, the authorities said.
But street cameras had captured her face, and, after the police circulated the images, an employee at her building in Astoria identified her, they said.
Officers showed up at her parents’ home, and, with the police closing in, she surrendered on Tuesday, almost two weeks after the assault.
Ms. Pazienza, 26, was charged with manslaughter and ordered held on $500,000 cash bail or a $1 million bond as her family looked on in the courtroom.
