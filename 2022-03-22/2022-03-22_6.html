     GameStop stock surges 25% as retail enthusiasm ramps up (NYSE:GME)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) +27% are rallying sharply Tuesday without a clear catalyst, reminiscent of the moves at the height of meme stock trading a year ago.
Shares are looking at a sixth-straight session of gains and have erased all the losses seen this month.
Short interest is about 18%, well below levels when GME saw short squeezes.
But market watchers have noted a pickup in out-of-the-money call buying, which could be producing a gamma squeeze effect.
In a gamma squeeze, call writers buy the underlying shares, increasing demand and boosting the price.

     GameStop (GME) Stock: Why The Price Surged Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The stock price of GameStop (NYSE: GME) increased by 30.86% today.
The stock price of GameStop (NYSE: GME) increased by 30.86% today.
There are no company-specific news reports or regulatory filings that appear to be driving up the price so it seems like external factors are at play.
Specifically, the stock price increases appear to be driven by a broader rally in the so-called “meme stocks.” And data from Quiver Quantitative suggests that there has been a surge in discussions about meme stocks on various social media platforms.
Plus, there has been an uptick in out-of-the-money call buying for the meme stocks, causing a gamma squeeze and driving up the price.

Since the March 14 year-to-date bottom of $78 per share, GME stock climbed an astounding 55%-plus in only six trading sessions.
The melt up may even accelerate, if FOMO (fear of missing out) leads other traders to pile in and bid up the price of GameStop stock.
This could be the result of increased demand for out-of-the-money calls on GameStop stock.
