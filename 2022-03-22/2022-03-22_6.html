     The Knicks Have Signed A New Player
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Thursday, the New York Knicks announced that they have signed Feron Hunt.
The announcement from the team can be seen in the tweet that is embedded below from the Twitter account of Knicks PR.
Hunt is 22-year-old, and went undrafted out of SMU in this past summer's NBA Draft.
He played in the NBA Summer League and the preseason with the Dallas Mavericks, but did not make the regular season roster.
The Knicks are currently the 12th seed in the Eastern Conference with a 30-41 record in the 71 games that they have played in so far this season.

     Summary: Strutting on his way out, Randle, who missed 15 of his 22 shots, gestured angrily at a referee as a security guard tried to usher him away.
Randle’s miserable season has been defined not only by his faltering jumper (30.7% on 3-pointers), but also by his open hostility towards the opponent, the fans and the referees.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been an up-and-down year and one filled with multiple fines for Julius Randle.
The NBA most recently fined the Knicks forward $40,000 for directing hostile language toward a referee in the franchise’s 108-93 loss to the Jazz on Sunday at Madison Square Garden.
In total, according to The Athletic's Fred Katz, Randle has received $155,000 worth of fines from the league this season.
Randle has an additional $29,000 in technical foul fines, resulting in the 11 technical fouls that he has received this season.

     Julius Randle's tough season with Knicks includes $130K in fines, but let's keep this all in perspective
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Julius Randle is making $21.8 million this season, and next season a four-year $117 million extension activates.
I say this to put into perspective the $130,000 that Randle has been fined this season; the man isn't exactly going broke.
Randle is having a tough season, as are the Knicks, and I'm sure that's adding to his frustrations in these moments.
Randle is putting up 20 points and 10 rebounds a night, so let's also have some perspective on the "tough season" tag.
Entering play on Tuesday night, the Knicks were 30-41 and five games back of the East's final play-in spot.

     Summary: Trae Young masterfully stuck it to the Knicks and their fans once again.
RJ Barrett couldn’t fully match Young in leading-scorer Julius Randle’s injury absence, finishing with 30 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks, who now trail No.
10 Atlanta by six games for the final play-in berth in the Eastern Conference with just 10 to play.
But you’re not eliminated until you’re eliminated so keep fighting,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said after the game.
Without Randle, the offense mostly ran through Barrett, and the Knicks held a 12-point lead midway through the second quarter.

The New York Knicks were all but eliminated from playoff contention several weeks ago.
Who cares if Tom Thibodeau plays RJ Barrett 42 minutes on the first night of a back-to-back?
Trae Young (45 points) destroyed New York, just as the prophesy foretold.
Tom Thibodeau was in his element even with Julius Randle sidelined...perhaps even more so.

Before the game, Young had a cool moment with film director Spike Lee, who’s widely known as the biggest Knicks fan.
But when asked about other Knicks fans sitting at courtside, Young blurted a sarcastic reply.
“Oh yeah, they always do (show respect), don’t they?”The All-Star guard also took to Twitter to throw more shade against the Knicks.

     Summary: Young had 45 points and eight assists in his first game at MSG since becoming a villain to New York Knicks fans, leading a late surge that gave the Atlanta Hawks a 117-111 victory Tuesday night.
Bogdanovic had 15 points and Young 13 in the second quarter, combining for four more points than the Knicks scored.
“We didn’t close the second quarter well and obviously we didn’t close the fourth well,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said.
Though they won the four that mattered most last spring, the Hawks had lost six straight regular-season matchups with the Knicks.
Knicks: Thibodeau said Randle has been dealing with soreness that hasn't gone away and that rest was probably the only thing that would help.
