     CJ McCollum proving to be invaluable to Pelicans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CJ McCollum has given the Pelicans a consistent scoring presence since being acquired at last month’s trade deadline, but his value to the team goes far beyond that, writes Christian Clark of NOLA.com.
With Zion Williamson unavailable all season and Brandon Ingram battling a strained hamstring, McCollum has taken over the offense since arriving in New Orleans, averaging 26.1 points and 6.7 assists in 16 games.
And I love the fact that he’s conscious about making sure he’s getting his teammates involved.”McCollum has also brought a much-needed dose of veteran leadership to the Pelicans.
They connected a few days later, and Williamson recently rejoined the team after spending two months working out on his own.
“You earn your vocal leadership,” McCollum said.

     With the Zion Williamson question answered, Pelicans can move on
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Pelicans have had the Zion Williamson question lingering over them all season, but it appears it may have finally been answered.
“Will Zion Williamson play this year?” has unfortunately been the key narrative of the 2021-22 season for the Pelicans, a question that is close to being answered.
According to Shams Charania of the Athletic, Zion is unlikely to play at all this season.
The Pelicans can move on this season without Zion WilliamsonI thought the Pelicans would make the play-in with or without Zion Williamson and that was before they added CJ McCollum to the team.
It’s not the news we wanted, as I truly think this is a championship-caliber team at full strength, but the Pelicans can now move on with their season without the question of Zion’s return lingering over everything.

     Zion Williamson injury update: Not expected to return at all this season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Sean Gardner/Getty Images)New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson will likely miss the entirety of his third season in the NBA.
Fast forward nearly six months to today and Zion has yet to play in an NBA game this season, and The Athletic’s Shams Charania has reported that Williamson is not expected to return at all.
But it’s a huge bummer nevertheless to see the 2021-22 NBA season completely robbed of one of its premiere signature young talents.
Even before last season, Zion was a revelation.
That is the most by any player through their first 60 career games since Michael Jordan (52 of first 60).

     Duke in the NBA: Kyrie Irving drops 60, Zion Williamson out for the season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Brooklyn Nets faced the Orlando Magic on the road Wednesday with Irving able to join them.
With such an on-off season, one might expect Irving to need time to adjust between rest and playing.
That is the most points scored in a half in NBA league history since Kobe Bryant scored 42 for the Lakers in 2003.
Carter was traded from the Chicago Bulls to the Orlando Magic midway through last season, making this season his first full-length one with the Magic.
At one point in the quarter, Carter scored seven straight to help the Magic take the lead back from the Thunder.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shams Charania of The Athletic confirmed on Monday what had seemed increasingly likely in recent weeks: Williamson will not return to the court for New Orleans this season.
Williamson initially had surgery to repair a fractured right foot in the offseason, but his recovery process has not gone as planned.
He has been seen doing shooting drills, and at this stage, he is able to put weight on the injured foot.
Williamson is eligible for a contract extension this offseason, and there could be hesitance on both sides to pursue one.
News Summary:Despite progressing on his damaged foot, the Pelicans’ Zion Williamson is unlikely to play this season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zion Williamson has not played a game this season as he’s recovered from a fractured foot.
It’s an obvious decision for a Pelicans team that has crawled out of a 1-12 start to put themselves in position to make the play-in game.
A day later, he posted a video of himself doing an under-the-legs dunk from a lob off the backboard — while shirtless.
Charania reported that Williamson is doing stationary shooting drills and can put weight on his leg.
The Pelicans are already a really fun team — we can’t wait to see what they look like with Zion next season.

     A Bright Spot Emerges in Zion Williamson’s Shadow
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pelicans’ future looked bright last summer, perhaps the brightest since the dawn of the Anthony Davis era.
That includes rookie Herb Jones, who would quickly become one of the few bright spots on the team—and a glimmer of hope for both the short and long-term future.
Down Williamson already and now Hart, Green took a leap of faith after Game 1, inserting Jones into the Pelicans’ starting lineup.
Herb Jones is waiting for the screen, fights over the screen and gets the steal on the pass to the slip.
One of his main pitfalls as a rookie: Jones often falls into foul trouble, ranking sixth in the league with 214 personal fouls.
