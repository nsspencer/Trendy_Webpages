     Summary: Actor Amanda Bynes has been released from a court conservatorship that put her life and financial decisions in the control of her parents.
Bynes was in the conservatorship for nearly 9 years at aged 27, after her behaviour caused concern for her parents.
The now 35 year old’s behaviour prompted her parents to establish court control through a conservatorship in 2013.
Bynes’ parents agreed that the conservatorship should end and no one else objected to the court’s decision.
When the conservatorship began, her parents told the court they were deeply concerned that Bynes may hurt herself or others.

     Judge ends lengthy conservatorship for actor Amanda Bynes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES (AP) — Actor Amanda Bynes was released Tuesday from a court conservatorship that put her life and financial decisions in her parents’ control for nearly nine years.
Bynes’ conservatorship played out, and came to an end, far more quietly and less contentiously than that of Britney Spears, who had a long, often bitter and public fight to free herself from a similar arrangement.
Bynes’ parents agreed that the conservatorship should end and no one else objected to the court’s decision.
Her parents said she also set a fire on the driveway of a home in the Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks, where she grew up.
Bynes has said in interviews that she has been sober for several years and she is studying at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles.
