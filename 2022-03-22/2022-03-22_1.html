     Ted Cruz's run in with the law: Cops called for conflict with airline employee at Montana airport
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) appeared to be leaving Montana on Sunday when he had a conflict with an airline employee, a video posted to Reddit said.
Cruz was flying out of Bozeman International Airport when he was angered by something not identified in the video and police were called to intervene.
Raw Story reporter Bob Brigham confirmed that this is Bozeman airport.
He appeared to be wearing his signature grey mask with the condom-shaped cannon on it reading, "Come and take it."
Raw Story has reached out to Cruz to confirm if it was him in the video and what the problem was at the airport.

So @TedCruz was apparently so out-of-control abusive to airline staff at the airport in Bozeman, Montana, that law enforcement had to get involved.

Journalist and author Grant Stern wrote: "Ted Cruz is flipping out in a Montana airport, probably because he's not in Cancun's more spacious, warm airport."
Rick Wilson, co-founder of the Lincoln Project, added: "Ted Cruz getting aggro with airline counter folks is so very on-brand."

     Summary: TED Cruz was forced to speak with security at a Montana airport over the weekend after becoming "frustrated" at missing his flight.

     Video: 'Frustrated' Ted Cruz Argues with Montana Airport Staff over Missed Flight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a 23-second video posted to Reddit on Sunday, Cruz was captured exchanging words with some employees at the Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport Sunday.
Bozeman deputy airport director Scott Humphrey told Daily Mail that Cruz was upset after he missed the check-in window for his flight.
It's unclear what exactly Cruz or airline staff said in the video, but the Reddit user who posted the video claims Cruz questioned if the employees knew who he was.
"One of our Public Safety Officers was in the ticket lobby and was asked to assist with a frustrated passenger at the United ticket counter (which is not unusual)," Humphrey told Daily Mail.
Comments on the Reddit post mocked Cruz, some referencing his flight to Cancun during the February 2021 Texas freeze.
