     Phil Mickelson to miss Masters for first time in 28 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Phil Mickelson is set to miss the Masters for the first time in 28 years after being removed from the tournament's list of active golfers.
The six-time major winner, who won the last of his three Masters green jackets in 2010, said last month he would take "some time away" from golf after being criticized for comments he made about Saudi Arabia's regime and the country's proposed new tourMickelson has been officially listed as a "past champion not playing" on the Masters website.
At the end of February, the 51-year-old apologized for his comments on the reported Saudi-backed breakaway golf tour, saying they were off the record -- a claim the reporter who interviewed him has denied -- and shared out of context and without his consent.
The Saudi-backed golf league is a proposed venture that is attempting to attract golfers away from the sport's main tours -- the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour -- with offers of big money.

     Summary: Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.
As nice a guy as [PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan] comes across as, unless you have leverage, he won’t do what’s right.
In addition, American Express said it would no longer use Mickelson as host of its PGA Tour event and said that his foundation would no longer be its charitable arm.
“There is the problem of off-the-record comments being shared out of context and without my consent, but the bigger issue is that I used words that do not reflect my true feelings or intentions.
“Mickelson simply called me up and opened a vein.

     Summary: Still, the entire sports world generally casts a stare at Augusta, which means it was another chance for Phil Mickelson to be a weenie and hide.
Mickelson said something truly dumb, perhaps even a shade evil, certainly tone-deaf, and egregiously selfish.
At the bottom of all this, Mickelson might have some decent points about what’s wrong with the PGA Tour for players.
It’s the one jewel Mickelson doesn’t have, having come in second six times, and wants desperately.
He’s not going to toss away maybe his last chance at a career grand slam because he’s embarrassed, right?

     Summary: This will be the first Masters Mickelson has missed since 1994.
A post shared by Phil Mickelson (@philmickelson)Mickelson has not competed on the PGA Tour since the comments were published, leading to speculation that the Tour had suspended him.
The PGA Tour does not reveal player discipline, something some want to change, including Rory McIlroy.
Mickelson's absence from the Masters, however, would not be the result of a supposed PGA Tour suspension, as it is not a Tour event.
Phil Mickelson has said he needed time away from golf.

“I think Phil has been a wonderful ambassador for the game of golf, still is a wonderful ambassador for the game of golf.

When news broke that Phil Mickelson would miss this year’s Masters for the first time in 28 years, it came as a surprise to many despite his controversial 2022 so far.
Mickelson has not competed in a tournament since releasing a statement last month apologising for comments he’d made in relation to the PGA Tour and Saudi-backed golf league.
Mickelson’s statement caused an immediate backlash from prominent golf figures, and led to the 51-year-old losing many of his sponsors.
PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan recently declared of Mickelson that “the ball is in his court".

Mickelson did not as much withdraw from the Masters - Augusta National officials either told him or strongly encouraged him not to come, according to multiple sources.
When asked at the Players if Mickelson had been suspended, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monaghan danced around the question.
The Masters, because it is run by the powers-to-be at Augusta National and not the PGA Tour, has the ability to invite – or disinvite – whoever it wants.
