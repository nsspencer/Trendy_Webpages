     Amanda Bynes, Former Child Star, Is Released From Conservatorship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A judge ruled on Tuesday to end the conservatorship that for the better part of a decade has governed the life of Amanda Bynes, who shot to fame as a child star on Nickelodeon and went on to have highly publicized struggles with substance abuse.
A court in California first ordered that Ms. Bynes be put in a conservatorship — a legal arrangement typically reserved for people who are older, ailing or have disabilities — in 2013, after erratic public behavior and a series of arrests.
Over the years, Ms. Bynes’s parents have overseen her life, taking control of medical and mental health decisions and, for a time, her finances.
A judge agreed to terminate Spears’s conservatorship in November.
But Ms. Bynes’s conservatorship appeared to reach a smoother ending.

     Judge terminates conservatorship for Amanda Bynes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A conservatorship for actress Amanda Bynes, which has been overseeing her personal and professional affairs for the past nine years, was officially ended by a judge on Tuesday.
"The conservatorship is no longer needed or required, and therefore the petition for termination is granted," said Ventura County Judge Roger Lund during a short hearing lasting just over five minutes.
Bynes' mother, Lynne Bynes, had been acting as her conservator and did not object to the request filed last month.
"The parents are happy, thrilled to get this good news," Tamar Arminak, an attorney for Bynes' parents, told NBC last month.
"The professionals say she is ready to make her own life choices and decisions and are so proud of her."

     A Judge Has Ended Amanda Bynes' Conservatorship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A judge terminated Amanda Bynes' conservatorship on Tuesday just weeks after the former Nickelodeon star filed paperwork to end the more-than-eight-year legal arrangement that put her mother in control of her life.
Bynes, now 35, petitioned the Ventura County Superior Court in California to end her conservatorship last month.
In court documents, her parents said Bynes appeared to have a substance abuse problem and had grown "extremely paranoid."
During Britney Spears' fight to be freed from her conservatorship last year, Bynes' case received renewed attention.
In a 12-second Instagram video earlier this month, Bynes publicly addressed her legal situation for the first time in years as she thanked everyone for their "love and support."

     Amanda Bynes conservatorship terminated after nearly 9 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A judge terminated the conservatorship of former child actor Amanda Bynes Tuesday after her petition to dissolve the arrangement was met with her parents’ full support.
Bynes, 35, has been in a personal conservatorship since 2013 following what she previously described as a dark period in her life.
A conservatorship of the estate was terminated in 2017 after her assets were moved into a trust.
The termination was filed by Bynes’ attorney at the end of February and was met with the full support of her parents, Lynn and Rick Bynes.
Bynes’ mother and personal conservator, Lynn, is particularly excited about the “next chapter” in her daughter’s life.

     Amanda Bynes’ 9-Year Conservatorship Ends: ‘She’s Done Everything the Court Has Asked’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UPDATE (3/22/2022): Amanda Bynes is a free woman.
The conservatorship of the person and estate of Amanda Bynes is hereby terminated,” Ventura County Judge Roger Lund said at the morning hearing that Bynes did not attend.
“She’s done everything the court has asked over a long period of time,” the judge said.
The court previously approved the transfer of Bynes’ assets to a lifetime trust formed outside the conservatorship with Bynes’ father as the trustee.
In her petition last month, Amanda Bynes informed the court she’s been living in a “structured community for women” since 2020.
