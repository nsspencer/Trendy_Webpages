     GameStop stock surges 25% as retail enthusiasm ramps up (NYSE:GME)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) +27% are rallying sharply Tuesday without a clear catalyst, reminiscent of the moves at the height of meme stock trading a year ago.
Shares are looking at a sixth-straight session of gains and have erased all the losses seen this month.
Short interest is about 18%, well below levels when GME saw short squeezes.
But market watchers have noted a pickup in out-of-the-money call buying, which could be producing a gamma squeeze effect.
In a gamma squeeze, call writers buy the underlying shares, increasing demand and boosting the price.

     Ryan Cohen picks up 100,000 GameStop shares, stock jumps

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A GameStop is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., January 27, 2021.
REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File PhotoMarch 22 (Reuters) - Billionaire Ryan Cohen's investment company bought 100,000 shares of GameStop Corp (GME.N), according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday, sending the videogame retailer's shares 16% higher in extended trading.
The purchase takes Cohen's stake in the company marginally higher to 11.9%, with the total number of share owned at 9.1 million.
Shares of GameStop closed up 30.7% at $123.14, registering their biggest one-day percentage gain since March 25 last year, with trading volumes soaring and likely squeezing bearish investors who sold the stock short.
There was no clear reason for the rally during normal trading hours, according to analysts.

Figure 1: GameStop Stock Up Strongly: It Could Be Heading To The Moon Getty Images(Read more from Wall Street Memes: NILE Stock: A High-Potential Penny Stock Worth Your Attention)GME: smells like meme maniaWhether or not GameStop investors even appreciate the term “meme mania”, today’s price action suggests that this is exactly what has been happening in the past few days.
Since the March 14 year-to-date bottom of $78 per share, GME stock climbed an astounding 55%-plus in only six trading sessions.
The melt up may even accelerate, if FOMO (fear of missing out) leads other traders to pile in and bid up the price of GameStop stock.
This could be the result of increased demand for out-of-the-money calls on GameStop stock.
