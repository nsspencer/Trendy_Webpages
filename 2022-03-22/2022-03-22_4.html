     There’s a New Taylor Swift Song (Yay!) in This Trailer (Boo!)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the poet Eve Plumb once said … marsh girl, marsh girl, marsh girl!
Everyone in the trailer for Where the Crawdads Sing is always talking about this “marsh girl,” a 5 percent feral young woman played by Daisy Edgar-Jones.
The movie is based on the best-selling book by Delia Owens, who might have been inspired by her own family’s implication in a Zambian murder.
Statistically, if you’re in a book club or you’re producer Reese Witherspoon, you’ve read this book already, but it’s still worth watching the trailer for snippets of the new track “Carolina,” written and recorded by Taylor Swift for the movie, which is out in July.
The closest thing you’ll get to a singin’ crawdad until then is Sebastian the crab.
