     Phil Mickelson to miss Masters for first time in 28 years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Phil Mickelson is set to miss the Masters for the first time in 28 years after being removed from the tournament's list of active golfers.
The six-time major winner, who won the last of his three Masters green jackets in 2010, said last month he would take "some time away" from golf after being criticized for comments he made about Saudi Arabia's regime and the country's proposed new tourMickelson has been officially listed as a "past champion not playing" on the Masters website.
At the end of February, the 51-year-old apologized for his comments on the reported Saudi-backed breakaway golf tour, saying they were off the record -- a claim the reporter who interviewed him has denied -- and shared out of context and without his consent.
The Saudi-backed golf league is a proposed venture that is attempting to attract golfers away from the sport's main tours -- the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour -- with offers of big money.

     Summary: Phil Mickelson has won an unlikely backer in the form of controversial TV personality Piers Morgan.
On the social media site, Morgan described the controversy surrounding Mickelson’s latest behaviour as an “unedifying sporting crucifixion” - and offered to play with the 51-year-old.
• Tough Match Play draw for Robert MacIntyre“Golf’s ongoing cancellation of Phil Mickelson has now forced him out of the Masters,” he wrote.
You don’t have to agree with the things he said recently, for which he apologised, to think this is now turning into an unedifying sporting crucifixion.
Monahan has repeatedly stated that any player who signs up to the new league will face a ban from the PGA Tour.

In addition, American Express said it would no longer use Mickelson as host of its PGA Tour event and said that his foundation would no longer be its charitable arm.
“There is the problem of off-the-record comments being shared out of context and without my consent, but the bigger issue is that I used words that do not reflect my true feelings or intentions.
“Mickelson simply called me up and opened a vein.
