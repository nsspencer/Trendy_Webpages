     Summary: The beginning of a new year often has us all feeling like starting off fresh by taking on better habits, getting rid of old ones, and—most commonly—changing up our look.
While others are hitting the squats and going into the salon for a pixie cut, why not start slow and steady with a cozy winter manicure in a color that feels new to you?
It takes only a little courage to step outside your usual OPI Lincoln Park After Dark or Essie Bordeaux, which is all you need to kick 2022 off on a fanciful foot.
From new wintry takes on classic dark nail colors to unique pops of color that'll have you feeling the opposite of boring, these are the best nail colors to try this January and tick off all the way into spring.

     Where is ‘Where The Crawdads Sing’ filmed?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The key location, though, was Kya’s home in the marshes, which was filmed in the Northshore area, on the banks of Lake Pontchartrain.
This area encompasses 80,000 acres of wetland, much of it a wildlife refuge.
Edgar-Jones certainly enjoyed the location: ‘It was such an incredible experience,’ she told Wonderland magazine.
A lot of the work was done for us by the nature; it’s such a character in the film.'
‘Where The Crawdads Sing’ is released in cinemas on Friday 22 July 2022

     There’s a New Taylor Swift Song (Yay!) in This Trailer (Boo!)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the poet Eve Plumb once said … marsh girl, marsh girl, marsh girl!
Everyone in the trailer for Where the Crawdads Sing is always talking about this “marsh girl,” a 5 percent feral young woman played by Daisy Edgar-Jones.
The movie is based on the best-selling book by Delia Owens, who might have been inspired by her own family’s implication in a Zambian murder.
Statistically, if you’re in a book club or you’re producer Reese Witherspoon, you’ve read this book already, but it’s still worth watching the trailer for snippets of the new track “Carolina,” written and recorded by Taylor Swift for the movie, which is out in July.
The closest thing you’ll get to a singin’ crawdad until then is Sebastian the crab.
