     Big 12 Basketball: Social media reacts to refs favoring Baylor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the afternoon of March 19, the first Big 12 basketball team competed in the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament to start off a key weekend slate for the conference.
An absolute social media firestorm took hold down the stretch in this game as Davis and the Tar Heels tried to fend off a second-half comeback from Baylor.
That included a vital technical foul call on big man Armando Bacot that helped Baylor rally in the second half.
But they brought up a valid point that the Tar Heels just didn’t do a good job of hitting the free throws when they were given the opportunity.
There is also still the possibility of the Tar Heels facing the Texas Longhorns or Purdue Boilermakers to decide the East Region in the NCAA Tournament.

     Men’s N.C.A.A. Tournament: North Carolina Ousts Top-Seeded Baylor in Overtime
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Baylor could not manage a basket for a stretch of close to four minutes in the second half.
Much of that came from Manek, whose 9 points in the first half came to feel small by the end of the second, when he had 17.
One shot after another, one opportunity after another exploited, the Bears looked like the team most expected to swagger through Dickies Arena and advance.
“They did not want to go home,” he said of Baylor.
Eventually, with less than 16 seconds left, the Bears tied the game at 80, where the score would stay until overtime.

UNC was up by 25 points then, bolstered by hot shooting from RJ Davis (who finished with 30 points) and playing better team basketball in all facets.
In wake of the upset, the East has become a wide-open region, now missing its top seeds in Baylor and Kentucky.
