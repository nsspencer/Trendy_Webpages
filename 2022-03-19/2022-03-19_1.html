     Carlos Correa agrees to deal with Minnesota Twins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Karen Warren/Staff photographerWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A fate that always felt inevitable came to fruition early Saturday morning in stunning fashion.
Carlos Correa is leaving the Astros, but not for the sort of "big, long deal" he envisioned.
Correa and the Minnesota Twins are in agreement on a three-year, $105.3 million contract with opt outs after 2022 and 2023, allowing him a possible quick re-entry into the free-agent market and insurance in case injuries arise.
Correa could be a free agent again as early as next season at age 28, perhaps still searching for the long-term deal he did not find this winter.
His departure ends a spectacular seven-season tenure in Houston, one that took him from prized wunderkind to playoff hero to team leader.

     Carlos Correa’s departure from Houston is now official, signs three-year deal with Twins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If it wasn’t already, Carlos Correa’s Astros tenure is now officially a thing of the past.
Despite recent reports indicating that a reunion was possible — if not likely — Correa will instead take his considerable talent up north and significantly boost an improving Twins squad.
To no one’s surprise, Fox 26’s Mark Berman broke the news:MLB source: Free agent shortstop Carlos Correa has reached an agreement with the Minnesota Twins (@Twins) on a three-year deal worth $105.3 million with opt outs after the first two years.
— Mark Berman (@MarkBermanFox26) March 19, 2022The terms of the deal are rather shocking, given that Correa’s prior asking price was reportedly upward of $300 million.
It’s not yet definitively known that Jim Crane did not match the Twins’ offer, but it’d be fairly safe to assume that he opted not to.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Detroit Red Wings: 6 players that could be on the move by Monday by Bob HeyrmanMany Detroit Tigers fans, including myself, woke up irate this morning finding out that 27-year old star shortstop Carlos Correa signed a three-year deal with the Minnesota Twins.
This was after Detroit Tigers manager A.J.
Detroit Tigers general manager Al Avila made a similar deal with Opening Day starter Eduardo Rodriquez.
The three-year $105.3 million deal Correa signed can be a one-year deal worth $35.1 million.
Detroit Tigers fans should be furious with Al Avila for not offering something similar to Carlos Correa.

Carlos Correa contract detailsCorrea reportedly agreed to a three-year contract worth $105.3 million.
MLB source: Free agent shortstop Carlos Correa has reached an agreement with the Minnesota Twins (@Twins) on a three-year deal worth $105.3 million with opt outs after the first two years.
The Correa contract capped a huge post-lockout period for Minnesota.
The Yankees took on all of Donaldson's contract (approximately $25 million AAV), which gave Minnesota more payroll space to go after Correa.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: — Erik Boland (@eboland11) March 19, 2022If you read what Hal Steinbrenner said Wednesday, #Yankees weren’t adding $35M for Correa to this season’s payroll.
The Yankees appeared to live up to their word and settled on Isiah Kiner-Falefa to be their stopgap at shortstop.
Now, to see that Correa could have been that stopgap shortstop all along?
Let’s grant that the Yankees have a budget under Steinbrenner that they refuse to go to Dodgers or Mets levels to match.
It’s a slap to the face for Yankees fans everywhere, regardless of how you feel about Correa personally after the sign-stealing scandal.

     Twins To Sign Carlos Correa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If the Twins fall out of contention this season, they’ll have a sizable trade chip on their hands in Correa.
March 18: In a stunning move, the Twins have agreed to sign the market’s top free agent, shortstop Carlos Correa, reports Mark Berman of Houston’s FOX 26 (Twitter link).
2 picks from the 2012 draft, Correa and Byron Buxton, will now be teammates for at least the 2022 season.
Correa rejected a qualifying offer from the Astros at season’s end, meaning the Twins, a revenue-sharing recipient, will forfeit their third-highest selection in this year’s draft in order to sign him.
However, he played in 148 games this past season and in 58 of 60 games during the shortened 2020 season.
