     Twins, Carlos Correa agree to 3-year, $105.3 million deal: Source
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Minnesota Twins have agreed to a three-year, $105.3 million deal with shortstop Carlos Correa, a source confirmed to The Athletic.
Correa was widely seen as the preeminent available free agent coming out of MLB’s lockout.
But it seemed inevitable that he would leave Houston via free agency when he turned down a six-year, $120 million extension before the 2021 season.
The favorite to take Correa’s place at shortstop for the Astros is Jeremy Peña, who Keith Law listed as the organization’s No.
Houston will receive a compensatory pick in the 2022 draft, as they tendered the qualifying offer to Correa after the 2021 season.

MLB source: Free agent shortstop Carlos Correa has reached an agreement with the Minnesota Twins (@Twins) on a three-year deal worth $105.3 million with opt outs after the first two years.
The Correa contract capped a huge post-lockout period for Minnesota.
The Yankees took on all of Donaldson's contract (approximately $25 million AAV), which gave Minnesota more payroll space to go after Correa.

     Carlos Correa agrees to three-year, $105M deal with Twins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Star shortstop Carlos Correa agreed early Saturday to a $105.3 million, three-year contract with the Minnesota Twins, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press.
Correa picking the Twins was a surprise, given they have lost 18 consecutive postseason games and finished last in the AL Central a year ago at 73-89.
Correa had a career-best 26 home runs last year to go along with a .279 batting average and 92 RBIs.
Carlos Correa Getty ImagesMoving to the Twins will be a change for Correa and his family.
Combined with Nick Castellanos’ $100 million, five-year agreement with Philadelphia late Friday night, Correa’s deal was the 14th since the World Series of nine figures.

     Summary: If it wasn’t already, Carlos Correa’s Astros tenure is now officially a thing of the past.
Despite recent reports indicating that a reunion was possible — if not likely — Correa will instead take his considerable talent up north and significantly boost an improving Twins squad.
To no one’s surprise, Fox 26’s Mark Berman broke the news:MLB source: Free agent shortstop Carlos Correa has reached an agreement with the Minnesota Twins (@Twins) on a three-year deal worth $105.3 million with opt outs after the first two years.
— Mark Berman (@MarkBermanFox26) March 19, 2022The terms of the deal are rather shocking, given that Correa’s prior asking price was reportedly upward of $300 million.
It’s not yet definitively known that Jim Crane did not match the Twins’ offer, but it’d be fairly safe to assume that he opted not to.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: — Erik Boland (@eboland11) March 19, 2022If you read what Hal Steinbrenner said Wednesday, #Yankees weren’t adding $35M for Correa to this season’s payroll.
The Yankees appeared to live up to their word and settled on Isiah Kiner-Falefa to be their stopgap at shortstop.
Now, to see that Correa could have been that stopgap shortstop all along?
Let’s grant that the Yankees have a budget under Steinbrenner that they refuse to go to Dodgers or Mets levels to match.
It’s a slap to the face for Yankees fans everywhere, regardless of how you feel about Correa personally after the sign-stealing scandal.

     Twins To Sign Carlos Correa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If the Twins fall out of contention this season, they’ll have a sizable trade chip on their hands in Correa.
March 18: In a stunning move, the Twins have agreed to sign the market’s top free agent, shortstop Carlos Correa, reports Mark Berman of Houston’s FOX 26 (Twitter link).
2 picks from the 2012 draft, Correa and Byron Buxton, will now be teammates for at least the 2022 season.
Correa rejected a qualifying offer from the Astros at season’s end, meaning the Twins, a revenue-sharing recipient, will forfeit their third-highest selection in this year’s draft in order to sign him.
However, he played in 148 games this past season and in 58 of 60 games during the shortened 2020 season.
