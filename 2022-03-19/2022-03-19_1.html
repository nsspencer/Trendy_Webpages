     Big 12 Basketball: Social media reacts to refs favoring Baylor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the afternoon of March 19, the first Big 12 basketball team competed in the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament to start off a key weekend slate for the conference.
An absolute social media firestorm took hold down the stretch in this game as Davis and the Tar Heels tried to fend off a second-half comeback from Baylor.
That included a vital technical foul call on big man Armando Bacot that helped Baylor rally in the second half.
But they brought up a valid point that the Tar Heels just didn’t do a good job of hitting the free throws when they were given the opportunity.
There is also still the possibility of the Tar Heels facing the Texas Longhorns or Purdue Boilermakers to decide the East Region in the NCAA Tournament.

     Six defining moments from North Carolina and Baylor instant March Madness classic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Whether it was a controversial ejection, gutsy plays down the stretch or head-scratching officiating, we're here to examine the defining moments of the game.
North Carolina had 21 turnovers in the game, and it's hard to imagine several of them occurring if Love hadn't fouled out.
That second 3-point play is even more clutch considering the Bears were down three and so many players would have jacked up a contested 3-pointer.
R.J. Davis' 3-point play as UNC goes cold in OTDavis was set to be coronated as the hero of this game, no matter how North Carolina won.
Baylor finished 1-for-11 in the extra frame, but it was that momentous play that silenced the Bears' efforts for good.

At one point, nine straight fouls were called on the Tar Heels as the Bears swiped, grabbed and reached for the ball at every possible moment.
The game, with the constant whistles and reviews, was a clinic on how not to officiate an NCAA Tournament game as the stripes cherished their one shining moment.
Among the former Tar Heels in attendance:, whose Mississippi State season ended this week.
Playing an hour from Waco, the Tar Heels built on their 8-3 regular season road record to get the win.12.

     Summary: When Brady Manek buried a 3-pointer to put North Carolina ahead by 25 points with 10:49 remaining in regulation Saturday, Baylor's quest to become a repeat national champion seemed more than over.
How's your blood pressure doing," sideline reporter Allie LaForce asked North Carolina coach Hubert Davis in his postgame interview broadcast live on CBS.
"I'm so proud of these guys because we've been in this situation before all season, and they've come through.
Since then, North Carolina is 8-1 with wins over Baylor, Duke, Marquette and Virginia Tech.
But it was exciting and thrilling and a reminder that March is filled with madness that comes in all forms.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 seed and defending national champion Baylor 93-86 in perhaps the wildest game of the NCAA Tournament so far.
UNC forward Armando Bacot was trying to think if he’s ever played in a game with a bigger momentum swing.
Carolina entered the game 44-0 in the NCAA Tournament when leading by double digits at halftime.
Manek’s elbow went high while trying to block out Baylor forward Jeremy Sochan on a rebound and sent him to the ground.
Bacot had a 3-point play when Baylor clearly fouled him — and it wasn’t called — before he ever got the shot off.
