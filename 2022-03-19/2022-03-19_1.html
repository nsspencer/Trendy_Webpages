     Big 12 Basketball: Social media reacts to refs favoring Baylor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the afternoon of March 19, the first Big 12 basketball team competed in the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament to start off a key weekend slate for the conference.
An absolute social media firestorm took hold down the stretch in this game as Davis and the Tar Heels tried to fend off a second-half comeback from Baylor.
That included a vital technical foul call on big man Armando Bacot that helped Baylor rally in the second half.
But they brought up a valid point that the Tar Heels just didn’t do a good job of hitting the free throws when they were given the opportunity.
There is also still the possibility of the Tar Heels facing the Texas Longhorns or Purdue Boilermakers to decide the East Region in the NCAA Tournament.

     Summary: Safe to say there's never been a game like that in Carolina basketball history, or maybe in college basketball history.2.
At one point, nine straight fouls were called on the Tar Heels as the Bears swiped, grabbed and reached for the ball at every possible moment.
The game, with the constant whistles and reviews, was a clinic on how not to officiate an NCAA Tournament game as the stripes cherished their one shining moment.

Playing an hour from Waco, the Tar Heels built on their 8-3 regular season road record to get the win.12.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 seed and defending national champion Baylor 93-86 in perhaps the wildest game of the NCAA Tournament so far.
UNC forward Armando Bacot was trying to think if he’s ever played in a game with a bigger momentum swing.
Carolina entered the game 44-0 in the NCAA Tournament when leading by double digits at halftime.
Manek’s elbow went high while trying to block out Baylor forward Jeremy Sochan on a rebound and sent him to the ground.
Bacot had a 3-point play when Baylor clearly fouled him — and it wasn’t called — before he ever got the shot off.
