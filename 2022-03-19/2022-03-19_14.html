     Summary: “I would say [the commitment to defense] is typical of the best teams we’ve had,” coach Geno Auriemma said “You can’t win with just playing really good defense.
But the best teams that we’ve had over the years have been really hard to score against, really hard to run their offense against.
But not every team wants to play at this level defensively.
Not every team wants to play this hard.
For a young team, I think it’s pretty unusual, for as many young players as we have, that they want to be that good defensively.”

     UConn Huskies win record 28th consecutive opener in NCAA women's basketball tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: STORRS, Conn. -- UConn Huskies coach Geno Auriemma wasn't too pleased with how his team played in the first 20 minutes of Saturday's NCAA tournament first-round game versus Mercer.
And they did it behind the phase of the game that's been an underappreciated hallmark of the very best UConn teams: stifling defense.
UConn pitched a third-quarter shutout of the Mercer Bears (20-0) on its way to winning the program's 28th consecutive NCAA tournament opener, a new Division I women's basketball record, surpassing Tennessee's stretch of 27 straight from 1982-2008.
But the real test will be when the Huskies face some of the more high-powered offenses these next few weeks.
"Every good team that's going to be left standing in the NCAA tournament a couple weeks from now is probably going to be a really, really good defensive team," Auriemma said.

     Summary: STORRS — All season long, the UConn women’s basketball team preached defense.
2 UConn advanced to Monday’s second round of the NCAA Tournament.
The Huskies’ defense was the best it’s been all season long, as UConn (26-5) kept the Bears scoreless in the third quarter to win its record 28th straight NCAA Tournament first-round game.
The Huskies finished the game outrebounding Mercer 53-30 and with 28 points in the paint compared to the Bears’ four.
“When she’s not in the game, our defense is not the same, and you saw it today,” Auriemma said.
