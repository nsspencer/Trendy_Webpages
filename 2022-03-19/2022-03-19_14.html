     Summary: It looks like we have confirmation of an official release date for the new season of Fortnite, chapter 3 season 2.
We haven’t had it this time, and we haven’t had the usual blog post confirming the release date for Chapter 3 Season 2.
Data-miners were able to catch one of Epic’s employees slipping up by all but confirming that the new season of Fortnite, Chapter 3 Season 2, will be released this weekend.
Hopefully, that is the official release date, and Epic is not in a position to postpone the season.

     Summary: According to the in-game Battle Pass, Fortnite’s current season is set to expire today with a new season kicking off Sunday, March 20th.
But there’s a problem: Epic Games hasn’t so much as dropped a teaser for Chapter 3, Season 2.
Maybe there’s some technical hang-up.
The only thing Epic has told me is a non-answer.
Just this tweet on the Fortnite Status twitter page (retweeted by the main Fortnite Twitter account) and an in-game notice about downtime.
