     What Juwan Howard said after Michigan basketball's win over Tennessee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a back-and-forth game in Indianapolis, as Michigan basketball took an early lead against the 3-seed and favorite Tennessee Volunteers before the Vols seemed to be in control midway through the second half.
However, as head coach Juwan Howard often says, basketball is a game of runs, and the maize and blue went on a run of their own while clamping down on the defensive side of the court.
Thanks to big games from Hunter Dickinson, Eli Brooks, and others, the Wolverines beat UT, 76-68, in a stunning upset against the SEC Tournament champion and one of the hottest teams in the nation.
Addressing the game, his postgame celebration with Chris Webber and Ray Jackson, as well as consoling Kennedy Chandler after the game, Juwan Howard shared his thoughts with the media in the aftermath.
Here’s everything he had to say.
