     Former Arizona men’s basketball coach Sean Miller hired by Xavier
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TUCSON, Ariz. (KOLD News 13) - Former Arizona coach Sean Miller is headed back as Xavier’s head coach, the university announced Saturday.
Miller was head coach of the Musketeers from 2004 - 2009.
In his 12 years with Arizona, Miller won 302 games and coached the men’s program to three Pac-12 tournament championships in 2015, 2017 and 2018.
Miller’s career as the Wildcat’s basketball head coach ended in 2021 under a cloud of controversy.
He was at the center of an NCAA basketball corruption scandal that involved coaches at seven different universities illegally offering money to student athletes to attend their programs.

     Arizona Basketball overcomes sloppy play, still beats Wright State
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY SportsSan Diego, CA – Despite turning the ball over 19 times, Arizona Basketball (32-3, 18-2) was still able to overpower Wright State, advancing to the Second Round.
Arizona Basketball offered more turnovers than a bakery on Friday evening, but luckily, it didn’t matter as the Wildcats were ultimately able to dominate, beating 16-seeded Wright State 87-70.
Weathering sloppy play, Arizona Basketball is one game closer to the NCAA Finals, winning its first tournament game since 2017.
So where does Arizona Basketball go from here?
With the win, Arizona improves to 32-3 (18-2) and now waits to play TCU in the Round of 32, who is fresh off a thrashing of 8-seeded Seton Hall.

     Summary: CINCINNATI (AP) — Former Arizona basketball coach Sean Miller returned to Xavier on Saturday, less than a year after the Wildcats fired him amid an ongoing NCAA investigation that’s stretched nearly five years.
“Xavier is thrilled to welcome Sean Miller and his family back to Victory Parkway,” Xavier athletic director Greg Christopher said.
“Amy and I are humbled to be returning to Xavier,” Miller said in a statement.
Miller became the third Wildcats coach to reach 300 wins with the program and went 302-109 in 12 seasons.
Arizona reached the Elite Eight three times, won five Pac-12 regular-season titles and three Pac-12 Tournament titles under Miller.

     Former Arizona men’s basketball coach Sean Miller rehired by Xavier
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Numerous outlets, including CBS Sports, ESPN and Stadium, are reporting that former Arizona coach Sean Miller will be hired at Xavier, the school the Wildcats poached him from 13 years ago.
With Arizona he went 302-109 from 2009-21, with five Pac-12 titles, four Sweet 16s and two Elite Eights, before the school fired him last April.
Xavier parted ways with coach Travis Steele earlier this week, a day after his team beat Cleveland State in the first round of the NIT.
Miller, who like Arizona is awaiting his punishment for the program’s alleged NCAA violations under his watch, would likely retain at least one coach from the Xavier staff: Danny Peters, who was on his final staff with the Wildcats.
Sean Miller picked the UA to win the national title, though he had the Wildcats beating Kentucky in the final.

     Summary: TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Shaina Pellington scored 30 points, Cate Reese added 16 and Arizona outlasted UNLV 72-67 on Saturday night in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament.
The Wildcats (21-7) were jittery early in their first home NCAA Tournament game since 1998, when coach Adia Barnes was still playing.
The 13th-seeded Lady Rebels (26-7) didn't flinch in their first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2002, drowning out the crowd noise to go right at last year's national runner-up.
