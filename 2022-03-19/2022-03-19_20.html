     Summary: It looks like we have confirmation of an official release date for the new season of Fortnite, chapter 3 season 2.
We haven’t had it this time, and we haven’t had the usual blog post confirming the release date for Chapter 3 Season 2.
Data-miners were able to catch one of Epic’s employees slipping up by all but confirming that the new season of Fortnite, Chapter 3 Season 2, will be released this weekend.
Hopefully, that is the official release date, and Epic is not in a position to postpone the season.
UPDATE: The release date has been confirmed for tomorrow March 20th with downtime starting at 7 AM UTC.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's almost that time, with the release of Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 2 being mere hours away.
Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 2: Patch NotesLittle is known about the Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 2 update with the developers remaining extremely tight-lipped about upcoming features and what theme the season will have.
Star Wars has had a large presence in the game before and a whole season, perhaps tied into the highly anticipated Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi TV series, would be fitting.
To get a taste - and a reminder of what has come before - here is the Chapter 3 Season 1 trailer.

     Summary: According to the in-game Battle Pass, Fortnite’s current season is set to expire today with a new season kicking off Sunday, March 20th.
But there’s a problem: Epic Games hasn’t so much as dropped a teaser for Chapter 3, Season 2.
Maybe there’s some technical hang-up.
The only thing Epic has told me is a non-answer.
Just this tweet on the Fortnite Status twitter page (retweeted by the main Fortnite Twitter account) and an in-game notice about downtime.
