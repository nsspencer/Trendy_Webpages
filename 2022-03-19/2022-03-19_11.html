     ‘Back To The Future' Legend Christopher Lloyd Is Joining the ‘Star Wars' Universe
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Other guest stars who have popped up include Bill Burr, Amy Sedaris, Horatio Sanz, Carl Weathers, Ming-Na Wen and Jake Cannavale.
The Mandalorian, currently filming its third season in California, was the first live-action series set in the "Star Wars" universe.
While most closely associated with his iconic sci-fi role on the big screen, Lloyd is no stranger to television.
Lloyd played Klingon Commander Kruge in the 1984's "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock."
With Christopher Lloyd on board, we're ready to fire up the Flux Capacitor so we can get here as quickly as possible.

     Summary: It would seem that everybody’s favorite Delorean-driving scientist is set to join the cast of The Mandalorian‘s upcoming third season.
Of course, fans may remember that Aliens and The Terminator star Michael Biehn made a really cool special guest appearance in Season 2 as the hired mercenary, Lang.
Whether Lloyd will play a similar role in season 3 remains to be seen.
Are you excited to hear that Christopher Lloyd will be making his debut in the iconic sci-fi galaxy far, far away?
Or will you be giving the next season of The Mandalorian a wide berth?

     Christopher Lloyd Is Joining A Major Star Wars Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Nathan Kamal | 13 seconds agoChristopher Lloyd has joined the cast of the upcoming season three of The Mandalorian.
The Mandalorian has been one of the most successful Star Wars projects in years, beginning with its premiere in 2019, and anticipation for the next season is hitting a fervently high point.
As more rumors and details about the upcoming installment of the adventures of the masked bounty hunter and his adorably tiny ward leak, the upcoming season just sounds all the more interesting.
The Mandalorian casting Christopher Lloyd is in keeping with the Jon Favreau-led series tendency to cast comedic actors.
Of course, we do not know for certain that Christopher Lloyd will be playing a comedic role in the third season of The Mandalorian.

     ‘The Mandalorian’ Season 3 Enlists ‘Back To The Future’ Star Christopher Lloyd
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 18 SHARES Facebook TwitterRarely do we see actors that have appeared in both “Star Trek” and “Star Wars” franchises, but given that Lucasfilm is developing multiple live-action shows and films at the same time, there is going to be franchise crossover at some point.
The third season of the Disney+ series “The Mandalorian” is currently shooting in southern California at the central production hub, and a new casting addition sees an old ‘Trek’ actor from the original wave of films join the “Star Wars” universe.
The Hollywood Reporter reveals that veteran character actor Christopher Lloyd, who played the villainous Klingon Commander Kruge in “Star Trek III: The Search For Spock,” and of course, Dr. Emmett Brown in the beloved “Back To The Future” trilogy, is joining “The Mandalorian” in a mystery role.

Lucasfilm also recently announced that highly anticipated, the Ewan McGregor-starring “Obi-Wan Kenobi” will debut May 25 as the next big live-action “Star Wars” event for fans to get hyped about.

     Back To The Future Star Christopher Lloyd Joins The Mandalorian Season 3
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mandalorian season 3 just got a little more eccentric, with Back to the Future's Christopher Lloyd joining up as a guest star.
But Star Wars has taken pride recently in welcoming real people from all walks of geek culture into its ranks, and the addition of Christopher Lloyd is no exception.
Lloyd, famous for his roles in classics like Back to the Future as well as for being Christopher Lloyd, has just officially joined the Star Wars universe.
But he will supposedly appear as a guest star, likely similar to one-off characters like Julia Jones' Omera in the season 1 episode "Sanctuary."
The Mandalorian season 3 is expected to release in 2022.
