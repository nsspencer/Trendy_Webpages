     Phillies Sign Nick Castellanos to Form Dangerous Lineup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With an expanded playoff in 2022, the chances of the offense being enough to get them in are very high.
The addition of Castellanos presents some enticing options for a lineup that should be must watch when firing on all cylinders.
The Gang Ignores DefenseCitizens Bank Park is one of the best hitters park in the league and a perfect environment for this lineup.
Segura is likely to lead off and Realmuto’s speed for a catcher makes him a good option in the two-hole.
While it may be difficult, figuring out where Schwarber, Castellanos and Harper go is a good problem to have.

     Phillies reach deal with Castellanos (sources)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Castellanos hasn’t posted an OPS+ below 112 (12 percent better than average) in any full season since 2017, and his 1,075 games played since 2014 rank 15th in the Majors.
The Florida native emerged as a doubles machine toward the end of his tenure in Detroit.
He led the Majors with 58 doubles for the Tigers and Cubs in 2019 -- the most by any hitter in a season since Todd Helton hit 59 in 2000.
Castellanos developed more fence-clearing power after signing a four-year, $64 million free-agent deal with Cincinnati before the 2020 season, averaging a homer for every 16 at-bats across the last two seasons.
He posted virtually no difference in platoon splits, finishing with a .936 OPS against righties and a .945 OPS against southpaws.

     AP source: Castellanos, Phillies agree to $100M, 5-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Free-agent slugger Nick Castellanos and the Philadelphia Phillies have agreed to a $100 million, five-year contract, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.
Kyle Schwarber agreed Wednesday to a four-year contract worth about $80 million, a deal that also was pending a successful physical.
Back in November, Castellanos opted out of the last two years of his contract with Cincinnati, which would have paid him $34 million.
Since the Major League Baseball lockout ended, the Phillies have signed free-agent relievers Brad Hand and Jeurys Familia, each to a one-year deal for $6 million.
In another move Friday involving the Phillies, the team lost right-hander Yoan López when he was claimed off waivers by the Miami Marlins.

     Implications of the Nick Castellanos MLB Free Agent Signing for the Philadelphia Phillies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you stayed up late enough on Friday night then you saw the news break just before midnight that the Philadelphia Phillies agreed to terms with MLB All-Star Nick Castellanos, per MLB insider Jon Heyman.
At the time of the Schwarber signing, most believed the Phillies would curtail their spending and avoid crossing the luxury tax threshold.
Castellanos' signing has only added to the task.
A potential Phillies lineup for a 2022 game could look something like this:1.
Perhaps the largest on-field implication of Castellanos' signing is the toll it will take on the defensive product that Philadelphia will run out onto the field.

     Summary: Up and down the lineup, Phillies players should feel less pressure.
Very fair price for the PhilsThe Phillies brought in Schwarber and Castellanos on deals worth a combined $179 million over nine years.
Defensive limitationsThere’s no denying this Phillies team skews offensive.
They’re positioned well to do so with Harper, Castellanos, Schwarber, Hoskins, Realmuto and Segura in the same lineup.
Draft picksThe Phillies forfeit their second-round pick for signing Castellanos because he was extended a qualifying offer by his former team, the Reds.

     Summary: Bryce Harper and Rhys Hoskins will be crucial pieces for the Phillies in 2022.
(Rich von Biberstein/Icon Sportswire)When Bryce Harper went to bed last night, he knew that the Philadelphia Phillies had improved their lineup this week with the addition of Kyle Schwarber.
The signing not only adds two guys who can mash into a lineup that already included Harper, Rhys Hoskins, J.T.
It’s a special thing being able to have guys at the top of our lineup and the middle of our lineup … it’s pretty well-rounded, just the length of our lineup is very impressive.
It just goes to show that this organization wants to win, they are committed to winning and I’m pretty excited right now.”MORE FROM PHILLIES NATION
