Photograph: Paul Greenwood/Colorsport/ShutterstockThe vast majority of the Chelsea fans at the Riverside, it should be said, stood and joined the pre-match applause for Ukraine.
On the pitch, it was all rather anti-climactic, but with Chelsea the story these days is only partially about that.
Their present reality was written, the red plastic seats in the south-east corner of the ground.

     Summary: Every year the question is asked: what is the point of the FA Cup, why should we care?
It was 44 years ago on Tuesday that Nottingham Forest claimed their first major trophy of the Brian Clough era, winning a League Cup final replay against Liverpool, the team they face in an FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday night.
Steve Cooper has created memories in Forest’s FA Cup run that will be treasured by their supporters.
It was, Thompson admitted, “a professional foul”, and today it would be a clear red card, but Liverpool were furious.

     Lukaku strikes as Chelsea reach FA Cup semi-finals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Middlesbrough (United Kingdom) (AFP) – Chelsea reached the FA Cup semi-finals for the third successive season as a rare goal from Romelu Lukaku inspired a 2-0 win against Championship side Middlesbrough on Saturday.
Unsettled Belgian striker Lukaku opened the scoring with just his second goal in seven games.
A host of bidders submitted their offers to buy Chelsea from Abramovich before Friday's deadline, offering hope that their current predicament will soon be over.
But they were eventually allowed to fly to Teesside, where they comfortably avoided any FA Cup turbulence.
It was Lukaku's 12th club goal this season and his 16th in the FA Cup since his tournament debut in 2012.

When Chelsea throw their cards in the air, they tend to come back down as ticker tape.
An FA Cup semi-final at Wembley is the reward for this comfortable win, secured thanks to goals from Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech.
Scorers: Lukaku 15, Ziyech 31 Subs (not used): Alonso, Bettinelli, Chalobah, Barkley, Havertz.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MIDDLESBROUGH, England (Reuters) – Chelsea continued to make light of their off-pitch turmoil with another impressive display on it as they reached the FA Cup semi-finals with a 2-0 victory at Middlesbrough on Saturday.
First-half goals by Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech knocked the stuffing out of second-tier Middlesbrough who had eliminated Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in previous rounds.
Middlesbrough were given raucous support inside the Riverside Stadium but never really looked capable of troubling the visitors who were always in control.
Despite the distractions, manager Thomas Tuchel has remained focused on winning games, and the performance of his players on Saturday was clinical.
When Ziyech’s shot then flew past Middlesbrough keeper Joe Lumley the hosts had a mountain to climb.
