     Summary: Michigan, the 11-seed, shocked Tennessee, 76-68, to upset the three seed and make it to Howard's second Sweet 16 in as many seasons — and fifth in a row overall.
The Tennessee coach has had some talented teams but has seen the second weekend of the NCAA tournament just once in the past decade-plus.
Many (probably Wisconsin fans) on Twitter argued that Howard should no longer be coaching after he was suspended for face-grabbing a Badgers coach.

They’ve already competed, however, in a surprising recruiting battle -- for Howard’s youngest son.
Juwan found himself in “a little recruiting war with one of the top programs in the SEC.”“I couldn’t come there as arrogant and saying, ‘Hey, this is family, family gotta stick with family,’” Juwan said.
Juwan acknowledged he was concerned his son would choose Tennessee over Michigan.
