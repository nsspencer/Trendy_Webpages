     Summary: This is the UFC London live blog for the feature lightweight bout between Paddy Pimblett and Kazula Vargas at the O2 Arena on Saturday night in London.
Unlike Pimblett, Vargas does not enter into this fight with a ton of hype behind him.
The 36-year old Mexican fighter has been with the UFC since 2019, when he started his run with the promotion with back-to-back losses.
Vargas was able to right the ship in his most recent fight however, winning a unanimous decision over Rong Zhu at UFC 261.

     Summary: (Photo by Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images)Paddy Pimblett denies ‘sheep’ Ilia Topuria’s callout after a stunning first-round comeback at UFC London.
UFC lightweight Paddy Pimblett promised to blow the roof off at O2 Arena, and he backed it up with a first-round finish of Kazula Vargas at UFC London.
Pimblett used his post-fight interview to address Ilia Topuria’s callout earlier in the card, following his win over Jai Herbert.
Before joining the UFC, Pimblett earned the Cage Warriors featherweight title over Johnny Frachey at CW 78.
UFC London took place on Saturday, March 19, 2022, live from the O2 Arena in London, England.

     Summary: Paddy Pimblett was ‘flattered’ by comparison to UFC superstar Conor McGregor, but knows he ‘is going to be bigger than him’.
The sport’s latest rising star, Pimblett, will be in action at UFC London against Kazula Vargas and has already had the highest of praise from UFC president Dana White.
“He is the biggest star the sport’s ever seen, but I know I am going to be bigger than him because I’m going to bring so many more eyes to this sport.
“Where he brought 20-odd-year-olds to the sport, I’m going to bring four, five, six, seven, eight-year-olds into this sport who are going to be MMA fans for the rest of their lives.
I was put on this Earth to fight and entertain people and I’m going to continue to do it on Saturday night.

     Summary: And the undefeated Georgian served up a performance on the microphone to match his Octagon showing, calling out fan-favourite Paddy Pimblett.
'Your guy here, Paddy Pimblett is a b****,' he said to strong boos from the audience.
Backstage, Topuria claimed Pimblett would not take a fight with him unless put under pressure by the UFC.
Maybe if Dana goes with a gun [puts a gun to his head], otherwise I don’t think so.
I don’t think he has the balls to fight him.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A head kick from Jai Herbert nearly ended Topuria’s night early, but he somehow recovered before making it to the final horn in the opening round.
Prior to the finish, Herbert was the one headhunting and looking to give the veteran featherweight a rude welcome to the 155-pound division.
Following the win, Topuria seized the moment by calling his shot after getting into a pre-fight altercation with England’s own Paddy Pimblett, who is also competing at UFC London.
Paddy Pimblett, win or lose, I want to fight you next and kick your ass like I did the last time,” Topuria shouted.
That Paddy b****.”

     Paddy Pimblett delivers on home soil as rising star secures first round submission win at UFC London
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Aspinall may be headlining UFC London but all eyes have been on Paddy Pimblett this week, and the UFC's hottest rising star did not disappoint on home soil.
Pimblett says he is never in a boring fight and although his clash with Kazula Vargas ended inside the first round, it certainly delivered.
From that position, Pimblett worked his way to his rival's back and that was all she wrote from there, sinking in a deep rear naked choke and forcing the tap.
Party time ensued in the O2 Arena, while Next Gen team-mate Molly McCann tore into the Octagon to congratulate her friend - having defeated Luana Carolina earlier on the card.
McCann - a huge Everton fan - was seen celebrating with former Toffees and Manchester United star Wayne Rooney immediately after Pimblett's win.
