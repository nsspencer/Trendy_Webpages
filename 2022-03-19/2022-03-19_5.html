     March Madness 2022: No. 1 seed Kansas survives shorthanded Creighton, advances to Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 9 seed Creighton nearly pulled off a shocker vs. No.
1 seed Kansas in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Saturday.
In the end, the Bluejays came up just short in their upset bid, falling 79-72 to the Jayhawks.
But that's when Kansas star Ochai Agbaji came up with a crucial steal and dunk to put Kansas back ahead 75-72.
12 seed Richmond in the Sweet 16 next week.

     CBS showed a graphic of someone who is definitely not Remy Martin during the Kansas-Creighton game and we’re all confused
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 seed, you would think that a television network would do its due diligence and put the bare minimum effort into presentation.
During one of the first commercial breaks, the network showed a graphic with Ochai Agbaji on the left, Christian Braun on the right, and someone who definitely isn’t Remy Martin in the middle.
The official Kansas Men’s Basketball account then weighed in on the snafu once Lucas blew the graphic up.
pic.twitter.com/lRLuUOxiYM — Blake Schuster (@Schustee) March 19, 2022At this time, there is no word on whether CBS is aware of who Remy Martin is.
My advice for next time would be to do a more extensive Google search when typing in “Remy Martin.” I’m still confused, but I won’t pry any further.

     Why Kansas basketball is fortunate to be advancing to the Sweet 16 with a win against Creighton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But O’Connell never got the opportunity to watch that shot fall, and Kansas (30-6) is advancing to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament instead.
Kansas controlled the boards by a wide margin and doubled up Creighton in second-chance points.
“It was a great game,” Jayhawks coach Bill Self said.
As he said, he’s been a part of NCAA Tournament games like this before.
Kansas has avoided going home with a loss in the round of 32, after both trips in 2019 and 2021 saw its NCAA Tournament runs end there.

     How UK basketball lost its all-time wins lead over Kansas | Lexington Herald Leader
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KU’s catching UK capped a relentless march toward the all-time wins lead by Bill Self’s program.
Last season, when John Calipari and UK went 9-16 and Self and KU were 21-9, also significantly eroded Kentucky’s all-time wins lead.
The UK program had been the all-time wins leader ever since.
Obviously, Kansas vacating prior wins or receiving sanctions of such severity that its future competitiveness is compromised could have implications in the all-time wins battle.
Kansas can supplant Kentucky as the all-time wins leader when the Jayhawks face Midwest Region No.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And that was because of one person in particular: KU guard Remy Martin.
Creighton’s Ryan Hawkins (44) plays off KU guard Dajuan Harris.
“Obviously, it was his night,” Creighton guard Trey Alexander said of Martin.
He faced Martin two years ago at Arizona State, with Creighton coming away with a 67-60 road victory over the Sun Devils.
The player McDermott saw on film this week was different from the one he’d scouted before.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fort Worth, Texas — Creighton coach Greg McDermott called it a chess match because of the way his team defended.
Kansas coach Bill Self said winning NCAA Tournament games is never something for which one should apologize.
For one, that was the time when Kansas made the biggest plays of the game while watching the Bluejays (23-12) come up short.
The Agbaji play came at the end of a long day of shooting the ball.
Kansas trailed when he checked in with 14:13 to play in the first half but went ahead just 29 seconds later.
