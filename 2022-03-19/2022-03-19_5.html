     MLB rumors: Trevor Story to Yankees or Red Sox on short-term deal is ‘possibility’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Carlos Correa off the market as of around close to 2 a.m., Saturday, EST, Trevor Story probably will be making his final decision, too.
While the Boston Red Sox and San Francisco Giants are considered favorites, the Yankees “have emerged a possibility” who is “under consideration at least,” MLB Network insider Jon Heyman tweeted on Saturday morning.
“Story is believed very open to considering a short-term deal with opt outs, a la Correa,” Heyman added.
“Yankees and Astros likely have an edge in Trevor Story pursuit as he’d play shortstop in either place,” Heyman added in another tweet.
Yankees are definitely in, whereas they really weren’t in on Correa.

     Colorado Rockies: The Trevor Story rumors have come full circle
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sep 15, 2021; Atlanta, Georgia, USA; Colorado Rockies shortstop Trevor Story (27) looks on in the second inning against the Atlanta Braves at Truist Park.
But he still could join the team that everyone thought he would join at the beginning of the offseason: The Texas Rangers.
Trevor Story won’t return to the Colorado Rockies … but he still could join the Texas Rangers.
Trevor Story won’t be returning to the Colorado Rockies but, according to Evan Grant of The Dallas Morning News, Story could still find a landing spot with the Texas Rangers … as a third baseman or an outfielder.

     Rangers pursuing Story, per reports
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MLB Rumors: The Texas Rangers are “in the mix” for Trevor Story, along with the Houston Astros, Boston Red Sox and San Francisco Giants, per Jon Heyman on Twitter.
Heyman also mentions the New York Yankees as being in on Story.
Story isn’t getting the dollars Correa received, and its going to be harder for him to get the opt outs, but something short term would seem to be likely what he is looking at at his point.
For the Rangers, the pursuit of Story would likely be in order to have him play third base for 2022, now that Josh Jung is out for the year.
Only the Astros and Yankees, of the five teams Heyman mentioned, have an opening at shortstop.

     Yankees Still Considering Trevor Story in Free Agency; Short-Term Deal Is 'Possibility'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Story is reportedly willing to explore short-term deals at this point in free agency, similar to what Carlos Correa agreed to with the Twins.
The shortstop is still "a possibility" for New York, per Jon Heyman of MLB Network.
Heyman added Saturday morning that Story is open to a short-term deal with opt-outs in his contract, something similar to what Carlos Correa signed when he put pen to paper on a three-year pact with the Twins late Friday night.
Story's willingness to sign a short-term contract is the wrinkle that makes this at the very least more feasible.
Over 142 games in 2021, Story hit .251/.329/.471 with 24 home runs, 88 runs scored, 75 RBI and 20 stolen bases.

Could Trevor Story be joining the Red Sox?
David Zalubowski/AP PhotoTrevor Story and the Red Sox have been linked for months, but there still appears to be a major roadblock: He prefers to play shortstop, and the Red Sox currently have an All-Star shortstop in Xander Bogaerts.
The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal reported the Red Sox are still “firmly in mix” despite Story’s preference to stay at his natural position.
Red Sox firmly in mix for free agent Trevor Story, sources tell @TheAthletic.

     MLB rumors: Yankees, Red Sox, Astros among teams interested in free agent Trevor Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After Carlos Correa's surprising signing with the Twins, veteran shortstop Trevor Story is the biggest free agent still available this offseason.
Given that the already abbreviated spring training is underway, the expectation is that Story will find a match soon.
Perhaps the offseason will allow Story to rest his weary elbow, yet some teams may already view him as a second baseman.
Such an approach could be appealing to win-now teams like the Astros and Yankees.
Whatever the specifics wind up being, resolution for Story and teams interested in him could be coming soon.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rangers are one of the latest clubs to be linked with free agent shortstop Trevor Story, per Evan Grant of the Dallas Morning News.
The Rangers, after all, have already signed two of the top free agent shortstops on the market in Corey Seager and Marcus Semien.
Beyond Story, there aren’t a lot of options left in free agency for the Rangers to add a third baseman.
But when the Rangers traded Kiner-Falefa to the Twins for catcher Mitch Garver, the machinations of the offseason really kicked into high gear.
From the same division, the Giants are the other team that have been mentioned as a potential suitor for Story.

     Summary: The Texas Rangers have already signed two big-name shortstops this offseason.
SURPRISE, Ariz. — Since the lockout ended and free agency resumed, the Texas Rangers have been busy in the free agent market.
After multiple reports circulated Friday night, a source confirmed with InsideTheRangers.com that the Rangers have been in talks with free agent shortstop Trevor Story.
Two of those big names—Corey Seager and Marcus Semien—both signed with the Rangers, which was the biggest splash of MLB free agency.
Prior to signing Seager and Semien, the Rangers hosted Story for an in-person meeting.

     Trevor Story Reportedly Choosing Among Four Teams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Along with the Giants and Red Sox, Heyman names the Rangers, Astros, and Yankees as teams who have potentially opened up conversations with Story.
5:37pm: Ken Rosenthal of the Athletic tweets that the Red Sox are indeed “firmly” involved in the running for Story.
The Mariners, meanwhile, hoped to sign Story to play second base earlier in the winter.
For instance, the general expectation is that Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts will opt out of the final three years of his contract following the 2022 season.
Were Story willing to change positions, he could slide in at second base in San Francisco and push Tommy La Stella into a versatile utility role.
