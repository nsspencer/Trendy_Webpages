    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool’s quest for the quadruple takes them into the path of another team pursuing something special.
Nottingham Forest’s win over QPR in midweek kept them in the hunt for a Championship play-off place and a potential place in the top flight for the first time this millennium.
Steve Cooper has transformed Forest and they have already shown their ability to torment top sides in the Cup by thrashing Leicester and beating Arsenal.
Liverpool have more squad depth than ever before under Jürgen Klopp but will have to prove that if they are to get past Forest.

     Summary: We have reached the quarterfinal stage of this year’s FA Cup and two Championship teams are still in the running.
How focused Thomas Tuchel’s men will be ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup meeting is still yet to be determined.
Chelsea have asked to play their FA Cup quarterfinal at Middlesbrough behind closed doors ‘for matters of sporting integrity’ because they are not allowed to sell tickets to their fans.
Palace are the other side left to have never tasted FA Cup success.
With seven games left until a champion is determined, the FA Cup still has a chance to see yet more magic and drama this weekend.
