     Summary: Gonzaga and Memphis are top 20 teams in the country when it comes to offensive tempo.
Players on the Gonzaga men’s basketball team ran down the hallways Thursday after the team’s first round win holding up five fingers.
Five fingers, representing the five wins that the Zags now need to secure a coveted NCAA national championship.
To knock down another finger, GU will have to take out Penny Hardaway’s Memphis Tigers at 6:40 p.m. PST Saturday.
Especially as winners of seven of their last eight games, the Tigers have become a threat for the Sweet 16 versus the national champion hopefuls Zags.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gonzaga faced a halftime deficit in each of its three losses this season.
The opening half of this basketball game was frenetic, and not in a good way for the Bulldogs.
But, that would have made things easier for Gonzaga which was not in the cards for this game.
Whatever was (actually, not the post-game cliffsnotes censored version) said during halftime is between Timme, the team, and God, but it did the trick.
Timme did the heavy lifting on offense while Holmgren held things down the fort on the defensive end.

     Drew Timme inspires Gonzaga, leads second-half comeback to take down Memphis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gonzaga advances to the Sweet 16 thanks to a scoring rampage from Drew Timme in the second half.
9 seed Memphis Tigers 41-31 Saturday in an NCAA tournament second-round matchup, leading scorer Drew Timme took it upon himself to set the tone for a second-half comeback.
After Memphis opened the second half with a bucket to extend the lead to 12, Timme scored the game's next seven points.
On Saturday, Timme was even quieter in the first half, scoring just four points on 1-of-3 shooting and 2-of-4 on free throws.
A 3-pointer by Lester Quinones pulled Memphis within two at 78-76, and two free throws from Landers Nolley II again produced a two-point game with a little over six seconds remaining.
