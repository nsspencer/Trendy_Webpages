    </h2>

     Summary: Gonzaga faced a halftime deficit in each of its three losses this season.
The opening half of this basketball game was frenetic, and not in a good way for the Bulldogs.
But, that would have made things easier for Gonzaga which was not in the cards for this game.
Whatever was (actually, not the post-game cliffsnotes censored version) said during halftime is between Timme, the team, and God, but it did the trick.
Timme did the heavy lifting on offense while Holmgren held things down the fort on the defensive end.
