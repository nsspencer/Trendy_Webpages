     Nottingham Forest v Liverpool: FA Cup quarter-final preview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool’s quest for the quadruple takes them into the path of another team pursuing something special.
Nottingham Forest’s win over QPR in midweek kept them in the hunt for a Championship play-off place and a potential place in the top flight for the first time this millennium.
Steve Cooper has transformed Forest and they have already shown their ability to torment top sides in the Cup by thrashing Leicester and beating Arsenal.
Liverpool have more squad depth than ever before under Jürgen Klopp but will have to prove that if they are to get past Forest.

     Soccer-Chelsea stroll past Middlesbrough into FA Cup semis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MIDDLESBROUGH, England (Reuters) – Chelsea continued to make light of their off-pitch turmoil with impressive displays on it as they reached the FA Cup semi-finals with a 2-0 victory at Middlesbrough on Saturday.
First-half goals by Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech knocked the stuffing out of second-tier Middlesbrough who had eliminated Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in previous rounds.
Lukaku tapped in Mason Mount’s low cross after 15 minutes before Ziyech fired home 16 minutes later.
Middlesbrough were given raucous support inside the Riverside Stadium but never really looked capable of troubling the visitors who were always in control.
Only a few hundred Chelsea fans were inside the stadium — a consequence of restrictions on them selling tickets — but they could at least celebrate their team reaching the semis for the fifth time in six seasons.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Champions of Europe, we know who we are,” chanted the 700-odd Chelsea fans gathered in the south-east corner of the ground.
Within minutes, Lumley was rescued by Anfernee Dijksteel, the defender’s impeccably timed goalline clearance denying Lukaku a second goal after the Belgian had wrongfooted the goalkeeper.
Despite the best efforts of Isaiah Jones, Middlesbrough’s talented right wing-back, the Chelsea defence persistently second-guessed even his most inventive manoeuvres.
Not that Bamba remotely showed his years, though, as his exquisite tackle came between Lukaku and another Chelsea goal.
Hakim Ziyech fires in to double Chelsea’s lead against Middlesbrough.

Rom's third goal in the competition this season!
𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙬𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙠𝙚𝙨 𝙖𝙜𝙖𝙞𝙣 🪄 Hakim Ziyech grabs himself a birthday goal!
Chris Wilder’s side – who had knocked out Manchester United and Tottenham in the two previous rounds – battled manfully as time ran down with Jones and substitute Duncan Watmore adding new zest.
Middlesbrough battled hard but could not make the breakthrough (Owen Humphreys/PA)However, they lacked the cutting edge to trouble a defence marshalled expertly by 37-year-old Silva enough to drag themselves back into the game.
