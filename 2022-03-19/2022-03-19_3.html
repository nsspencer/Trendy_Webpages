    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal tightened their stranglehold on fourth spot in the Premier League with a 1-0 victory over Aston Villa at Villa Park.
Bukayo Saka netted the only goal of the game, with his drilled effort from outside the box making its way through a crowd of players and beating former Arsenal shot-stopper Emiliano Martinez in the Villa goal.
Steven Gerrard’s side pushed for an equaliser in the second half and went close went Ollie Watkins’ deflected effort struck the post.
And with the last kick of the game, Philippe Coutinho’s free kick was brilliantly kept out by stand-in goalkeeper Bernd Leno.
Villa meanwhile, remain in the top half of the table despite picking up back-to-back defeats.

     Saka strike enough to earn Arsenal win at Villa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BIRMINGHAM, England, March 19 (Reuters) - Fourth-placed Arsenal opened up a four-point gap over Manchester United, one place below, in the Premier League standings after Bukayo Saka's first-half strike earned them a 1-0 victory at Aston Villa on Saturday.
Their fine, flowing first-half football deserved more than the one goal given to them by Saka on the half-hour mark -- Arsenal's 2,000th Premier League strike.
"It was a big win," Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta said.
We did not get that second goal today.
Smith Rowe fired over early on from a great position, before he set up Thomas Partey, whose strike was too close to Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.

     Summary: Mikel Arteta revealed that Aaron Ramsdale will be ruled out for “a few weeks” with a hip injury, in a blow for both Arsenal and England.
Ramsdale has been a revelation between the sticks for the Gunners after keeping 12 clean sheets in 24 Premier League matches, second only to Ederson and Alisson who have kept 16 shut-outs.
“It’s normal because he’s such a competitive boy, but he needs to realise that this is going to happen in your career.
“If you want to be at the top for 10, 15 or 20 years you have to be prepared for that.

     Aaron Ramsdale injury: How long is Arsenal star out for? What we know so far and FPL replacements
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mikel Arteta is facing up to the prospect of being without Arsenal‘s first-choice goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale for “a few weeks” due to a hip injury.
“He has an injury in his oblique muscle and he will be out for a few weeks,” confirmed Arteta before Arsenal’s game against Aston Villa on Saturday.
Speaking on BT Sport, former Arsenal defender Martin Keown backed Bernd Leno to cover effectively for Arsenal’s No 1.
News of Ramsdale’s injury came as a blow to millions of Fantasy Premier League managers, particularly as Arsenal’s game was one of only four taking place in the league this weekend.
Kasper Schmeichel (£4.8m) is another good option with Leicester scheduled to play twice in Gameweek 33 against Newcastle and Everton.
