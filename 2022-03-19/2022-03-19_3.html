     Chelsea stroll past Middlesbrough into FA Cup semis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MIDDLESBROUGH, England, March 19 (Reuters) - Chelsea continued to make light of their off-pitch turmoil with another impressive display on it as they reached the FA Cup semi-finals with a 2-0 victory at Middlesbrough on Saturday.
First-half goals by Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech knocked the stuffing out of second-tier Middlesbrough who had eliminated Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in previous rounds.
Despite the distractions, manager Thomas Tuchel has remained focused on winning games, and the performance of his players on Saturday was clinical.
When Ziyech's shot then flew past Middlesbrough keeper Joe Lumley the hosts had a mountain to climb.
"It's been a tough couple of weeks but for us, as a team, we're just focused and ready to play."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool’s quest for the quadruple takes them into the path of another team pursuing something special.
Nottingham Forest’s win over QPR in midweek kept them in the hunt for a Championship play-off place and a potential place in the top flight for the first time this millennium.
Steve Cooper has transformed Forest and they have already shown their ability to torment top sides in the Cup by thrashing Leicester and beating Arsenal.
Liverpool have more squad depth than ever before under Jürgen Klopp but will have to prove that if they are to get past Forest.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Tuchel’s players controlling the tempo, Wilder’s normally cohesive pressing game rarely hit its customary heights and an upset never really seemed feasible.
“It was tough to make it look comfortable though,” said Tuchel, who switched his formation to 4-1-4-1 to counter Boro’s press.
Mount, who had a very good game, created Chelsea’s second goal too.
Hakim Ziyech fires in to double Chelsea’s lead against Middlesbrough.
We nearly got the press right but if you don’t get it quite right against Chelsea they’ll cut through you.

     Summary: AdvertisementThose associated with Chelsea have long since known that their club exists on the footballing equivalent of a fault line.
When Chelsea throw their cards in the air, they tend to come back down as ticker tape.
An FA Cup semi-final at Wembley is the reward for this comfortable win, secured thanks to goals from Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech.
Scorers: Lukaku 15, Ziyech 31 Subs (not used): Alonso, Bettinelli, Chalobah, Barkley, Havertz.
He used that freedom to sweep a ball across goal and Lukaku, unmarked despite the nearby attendance of two red jerseys, turned in.
