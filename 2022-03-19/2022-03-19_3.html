     Arsenal tops Villa 1-0, strengthens hold on 4th place in EPL
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Story continues below advertisementSaka was a constant danger and his well-taken goal took him to nine in the league this season, during which he has established himself as regular on the right wing.
This season is the first in a quarter of a century that Arsenal has not been involved in European competition.
Arsenal also has a game in hand over United, which isn’t in action this weekend.
Ninth-place Villa was strangled by Arsenal’s intensity in midfield and had only a few sights on goal, mostly in the second half.
From one, Ollie Watkins struck the base of the post in the 68th minute with what proved to be the hosts’ best chance.

Speaking at Saturday's news conference ahead of a clash with Salernitana, Allegri said: "Salernitana are different to the first meeting, they've done well and are playing better.
"We must immediately erase the Champions League exit and finish this period in the best possible way to try to stay three points behind Inter."
"On Tuesday we weren't the team that could win the Champions League, on Thursday it's all over again, it's failure.
Above all, to have the ambition of being three points behind Inter when we play them [at home on April 3]."
