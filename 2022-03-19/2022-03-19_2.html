     Friday MLB Free Agents/Trades/Rumors Wrap-up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Friday was a slow news day for baseball media, but after the sun went down, the free agent market heated up.
At 1:41 a.m., Mark Berman of Houston's Fox 26 reported that Carlos Correa was in agreement with the Minnesota Twins on a three-year/$105.3 million deal.
LHP Tyler Anderson agreed to terms with the Dodgers on a one-year/$8 million deal, according to Passan.
Heyman believes that Story is now choosing between four teams, the San Francisco Giants, Boston Red Sox, and two mystery teams.
Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic says the Red Sox are "firmly in the mix" for the star shortstop, but the "situation is still fluid."

     Phillies Sign Slugger Nick Castellanos, Bolster Lineup, Blow Past Luxury Tax
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phillies sign slugger Nick Castellanos, bolster lineup, blow past luxury tax originally appeared on NBC Sports WashingtonCLEARWATER, Fla. -- The Phillies continued their mid-March spending spree when they agreed on a five-year, $100 million contract with free-agent slugger Nick Castellanos late Friday night, multiple sources confirmed.
Like Hoskins, Harper and third baseman Alec Bohm, Castellanos is a client of agent Scott Boras.
Add them to a lineup that includes Harper, Hoskins, Realmuto and Jean Segura and the Phillies will try to outscore their defensive shortcomings.
Castellanos, a right-handed bat, could hit in the fourth spot, behind Harper, with Hoskins and Realmuto in the middle, as well.
For now, what matters is the Phillies’ lineup is a lot more formidable today than it was a week ago.

     10 thoughts on Phillies signing Nick Castellanos
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Up and down the lineup, Phillies players should feel less pressure.
Very fair price for the PhilsThe Phillies brought in Schwarber and Castellanos on deals worth a combined $179 million over nine years.
Defensive limitationsThere’s no denying this Phillies team skews offensive.
They’re positioned well to do so with Harper, Castellanos, Schwarber, Hoskins, Realmuto and Segura in the same lineup.
Draft picksThe Phillies forfeit their second-round pick for signing Castellanos because he was extended a qualifying offer by his former team, the Reds.

     Phillies land Nick Castellanos on 5-year, $100M deal: 8 thoughts on what it means for 2022 — and beyond
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They have crossed the Rubicon, and somehow a $240 million payroll does not come with guarantees.
But it is exciting.With Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber secured for a combined $179 million, the Phillies will still be projected to finish third in the National League East.
But team officials think the gap between the Mets and Phillies isn’t as wide as public projections.
The defending-champion Braves might be in a different class after their own frenetic offseason.
They outscored the Phillies by 19 runs in 19 games last season, but the margin between the teams was evident in the final week of the season.All three teams reloaded and prioritized certain traits.
