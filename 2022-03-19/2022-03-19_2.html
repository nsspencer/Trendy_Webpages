     Summary: We were well aware of it for a while now, and it's definitely been wearing on us,” Dickinson said.
The Wolverines beat a Tennessee team that hadn’t lost in a month and had dropped just one game since Feb. 1, and earned a spot in the Sweet 16 in the process.
Dickinson and Brooks combined for 50 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists, and each played more than 37 minutes.
But the story today is Michigan, a team that has had many opportunities to fracture this season.
