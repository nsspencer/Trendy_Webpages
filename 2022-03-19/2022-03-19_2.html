     Big 12 Basketball: Social media reacts to refs favoring Baylor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On the afternoon of March 19, the first Big 12 basketball team competed in the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament to start off a key weekend slate for the conference.
An absolute social media firestorm took hold down the stretch in this game as Davis and the Tar Heels tried to fend off a second-half comeback from Baylor.
That included a vital technical foul call on big man Armando Bacot that helped Baylor rally in the second half.
But they brought up a valid point that the Tar Heels just didn’t do a good job of hitting the free throws when they were given the opportunity.
There is also still the possibility of the Tar Heels facing the Texas Longhorns or Purdue Boilermakers to decide the East Region in the NCAA Tournament.

     Summary: Safe to say there's never been a game like that in Carolina basketball history, or maybe in college basketball history.2.
At one point, nine straight fouls were called on the Tar Heels as the Bears swiped, grabbed and reached for the ball at every possible moment.
The game, with the constant whistles and reviews, was a clinic on how not to officiate an NCAA Tournament game as the stripes cherished their one shining moment.

Playing an hour from Waco, the Tar Heels built on their 8-3 regular season road record to get the win.12.

1 seed in the East region and the reigning national champion, to advance to the round of 16 in the N.C.A.A.
As Roy Williams, who retired as North Carolina’s coach last year but was in the stands on Saturday, might say: “Daggum.”The description could also aptly describe much of the rest of the action Saturday in the tournament.
St. Peter’s — yes, the 15th-seeded Peacocks — advanced to the round of 16 with a victory over No.
7 seed Murray State, and the field’s top overall seed, Gonzaga, fought harder than expected to get past No.
