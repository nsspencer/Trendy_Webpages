     Russia claims to use a hypersonic missile in attack on arms depot in Ukraine.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Russia has fired scores of guided missiles into Ukraine, but on Saturday it claimed for the first time that it had launched one capable of hypersonic speed in an attack on an ammunition depot in western Ukraine.
The report could not be independently verified, but if true could be the first use of a hypersonic weapon in combat.
Hypersonics, generally defined as weapons capable of flying at speeds over Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound, are at the center of an arms race among the United States, Russia and China.
The United States has pursued development of this type of weapon since the early 2000s, focusing on two different variants, according to a report released Thursday by the Congressional Research Service.
The Pentagon requested $3.8 billion for hypersonic research in fiscal year 2022.

     Russia says it used a hypersonic missile in Ukraine for first time: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian defense ministry officials said the country used a new hypersonic missile in an attack on Ukraine on Friday, marking its first use in combat.
The hypersonic missile, called Kinzhal ("Dagger" in Russian), was used in an attack on a large underground warehouse in southwestern Ukraine, according to Bloomberg News, which cited that Russia's claim had yet to be independently verified.
The United States, Russia, China and North Korea have been developing hypersonic weapons, some of which are launched into space, in pursuit of long-range flight and maneuverability.
North Korea claims to have tested its hypersonic missile this year.
Last August, China reportedly launched a hypersonic missile test on a Long March rocket, with the U.S. military testing hypersonic technology in a series of small rocket launches in October.

     Why is Putin firing a hypersonic missile in Ukraine?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Putin, like many other belligerent autocrats, does like his Wunderwaffen, or ‘wonder weapons.’ Now it appears he’s even used one in an act of wasteful overkill in Ukraine: using the hypersonic Kh-47M2 Kinzhal (Dagger) missile to apparently destroy an arms depot in western Ukraine.
Only a single Kinzhal had been fired in anger to date, in Syria, and more than anything else as a test of concept.
Even if it is not armed with a nuclear warhead, a Kinzhal carries 500 kg of high explosive, which is certainly enough to deliver a serious punch to an underground bunker.
Yet the use of the Kinzhal may also reflect the way that Moscow’s stocks of other precision-guided systems appear to be running low.
Therefore an ostensible demonstration of power and capability might also, perversely, prove to be a demonstration of exhaustion of options and resources.

     Summary: An MiG-31K fighter of the Russian air force carrying a Kinzhal hypersonic cruise missile is seen during the Grom-2022 Strategic Deterrence Force exercise at an undefined location in Russia in February.
Nearly 14,400 Russian personnel have been killed in Ukraine as of Saturday, according to The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
But Mykhailo Podolyak, Ukraine’s chief negotiator in talks with Russia, said the talks could take weeks or longer.
The fall of Mariupol would be a major advance for Russia, giving it a land link to the Crimean peninsula, which Russia took in 2014.
“No way back”U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there should be no way back from international isolation for Putin’s Russia.
