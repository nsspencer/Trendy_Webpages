    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Joshua Bessex/Getty ImagesThe SEC has had a tough few days at the 2021-22 men's basketball NCAA tournament.
The fourth-seeded Razorbacks knocked off 12th-seeded New Mexico State, 53-48, in West Regional second-round action.
Arkansas rode its suffocating defense to the win, holding the Aggies to 34 shooting from the field while forcing 19 turnovers.
And they stymied New Mexico State's leading scorer, Teddy Allen, forcing him to either give up the ball or settle for tough looks.
But he was also the one Arkansas player who didn't seem shy when it came to attacking New Mexico State's defense.

So when did New Mexico State last win an NCAA Tournament game that still counts?
So maybe it is only fitting that New Mexico State came to Western New York, where the Bonnies play, to win another NCAA Tournament game.

Allen got stupid hot last game, scoring 37 points to the entire rest of his team's 33 in a 70-63 upset of UConn.
Gregory Fisher / USA TODAY SportsHowever, Allen's size and ability to shoot the ball from a high launch point with absurd arc mans Davis is too small for the job.
While the rest of team doesn't explode off the screen on offense, they are a collective potential nightmare for the Hogs on defense.
Gregory Fisher / USA TODAY Sports Mark Konezy / USA TODAY SportsThe Hogs will need a lot of motion, creating moments where players get lost and sneak on from behind through a crease unseen.

     Summary: As one fan pointed out, when Arkansas was at its best, the Razorbacks' mantra was, "We'll take an ugly win anytime over a pretty loss."
In this case, the Hogs' hideous 53-48 win over the Aggies was enough to move on to a Sweet 16 showdown with No.
1 seed Gonzaga in Eric Musselman's old stomping grounds of San Francisco where he coached the Golden State Warriors.
For much of the game, Arkansas looked exhausted.
The Razorbacks were up 26-13 with a chance to send New Mexico State into the break with as many turnovers as points.
