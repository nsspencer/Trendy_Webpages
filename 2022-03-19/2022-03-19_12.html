     Rams trade Robert Woods to Titans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Rams are trading wide receiver Robert Woods to the Titans.
Woods is due a $10 million base salary this season; there’s no immediate word on whether he has agreed to a new contract with the Titans.
Woods had spent the last five years with the Rams after playing four years before that for the Bills.
Titans offensive coordinator Todd Downing was on the Bills’ staff in 2014 when Woods was in Buffalo, so there’s some familiarity there.
The Titans were in the market for a wide receiver after cutting Julio Jones, and Woods is their man.

     NFL Rumors: Robert Woods Traded from Rams to Titans for 2023 6th-Round Draft Pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AP Photo/Kyusung GongThe Tennessee Titans have acquired Robert Woods in a trade with the Los Angeles Rams, according to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network.
The Rams will receive a 2023 sixth-round pick in exchange for the receiver, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Michael Fabiano of Sports Illustrated first reported the Titans had "real interest" in Woods.
The Rams had a surplus at receiver after signing veteran Allen Robinson to a three-year deal, per Schefter.
The knee injury ended Woods' 2021 season after just nine games, finishing with 45 catches for 556 yards and four touchdowns.

     Fans are not happy the Rams traded Robert Woods for almost nothing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Rams have once again parted ways with a fan favorite.
On Saturday night, they agreed to trade wide receiver Robert Woods to the Tennessee Titans, getting just a 2023 sixth-round pick in return.
Woods has been with the Rams for the last five years and was one of their most productive and reliable players.
For that reason, fans are not happy with the Rams for trading Woods away – especially given the minimal return.
A 2023 sixth-round pick is not very much to get in exchange for a starting receiver, even if it does give the Rams cap flexibility.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tennessee is acquiring Robert Woods from the Rams for a 2023 sixth-rounder, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported.
Los Angeles had been shopping the veteran wide receiver in the wake of signing Allen Robinson, and the Titans were in the market for a No.
Woods shared go-to duties with Cooper Kupp for four years before the latter's breakout season in 2021.
Rapoport cited Woods' contract -- he's owed $13.5 million this year -- and the offense's evolution in his absence as two factors.
The Rams are also still interested in bringing back Odell Beckham﻿, who is a free agent and also rehabilitating a torn ACL.

     Rams To Trade WR Robert Woods To Titans
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2020, he fell 64 yards short of three-straight 1,000-yard receiving seasons, totaling 3,289 yards over that span.
Unfortunately, Woods’ 2021 season was cut short when he suffered a torn ACL in a November practice.
Luckily for the Rams, the day before Woods’ injury, they had signed Beckham, who was able to make up for the production lost due to Woods’ absence.
That responsibility will now be passed on to the Titans to make Woods’ cap hit more manageable.
They addressed the lackluster passing attack by signing former Falcons’ and Browns’ tight end Austin Hooper and the addition of Woods will give the Titans three strong weapons in the passing game.
