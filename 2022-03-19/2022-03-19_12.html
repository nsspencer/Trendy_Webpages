     At Harvard, Ketanji Brown Jackson Fought Injustices but Kept a Steely Academic Focus

     Summary: One involved a professor who sued the Environmental Protection Agency over a Freedom of Information Act request.
Another challenged the Department of Education’s campus sexual assault rules, to which Harvard was reviewing its own response.
But Mr. Turley said in an interview that his belief that Judge Jackson should recuse herself has nothing to do with her race.
“Most citizens would be taken aback by a judge, let alone a justice, voting on a case on a university on which she sat on a governing board,” he said.
“It would be akin to a justice ruling on an Exxon lease dispute after being on an Exxon board.”

     Ketanji Brown Jackson hearings begin – could Republicans sink her chances?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Monday’s hearing will be devoted to opening statements from Jackson and from the committee’s 22 senators, who are evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.
In nominating Jackson, Biden honoured the pledge he made during the 2020 presidential election campaign to pick a Black woman for the court.
Leading Republicans have attempted to use Biden’s selection of a Black woman as a stick with which to beat him.
She is unusual among candidates for the supreme court to have had experience as a public defender representing criminal defendants.
That court has been labelled the “second highest court in the land” because so many supreme court justices have been plucked from there.

     U.S. Senate hearings for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson to start Monday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After more than two weeks of private meetings with nearly half the U.S. Senate, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden’s pick for the U.S. Supreme Court, will field questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee in highly anticipated public hearings that begin Monday.
Jackson would make history as the first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court.
Originally from Miami, she graduated from Harvard Law School, worked as a public defender — another potential first for the Supreme Court — was a federal district court and vice chair of the U.S.
None has publicly committed to voting for her for the Supreme Court.
The Senate Judiciary chairman is Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ketanji Brown Jackson's long judicial record is likely to be scrutinized at hearingstoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe Thesaurus has no synonyms for the phrase, "confirmation hearing."
And beast because when it comes to a Supreme Court nomination, it is treacherous for the nominee, while offering enormous opportunities for her questioners.
Keep that in mind as the Senate Judiciary Committee opens hearings Monday on the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Still, the Senate does have the constitutional authority, and duty, to advise and consent to Supreme Court nominations.
An Unrevealing Judicial RecordBut conservative libertarian Erik Jaffe, policy director of a First Amendment advocacy group, counters that Judge Jackson's record isn't much help because the job of a district court judge is to follow precedent.

     Senate to begin historic Supreme Court hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Senate hearings are set to take place this week in a historic confirmation battle over the first Black woman ever nominated to serve on the Supreme Court.
President Joe Biden's pick, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, goes before the Democratic-led Judiciary Committee on Monday for a high-stakes showdown to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer and win a lifetime appointment to the country's highest court.
Monday will provide a glimpse into how contentious the confirmation battle may get before Jackson faces two days of senatorial questioning.
He has said he wants the full Senate to confirm Jackson by April 9.
The White House's strategyThe committee is split evenly between members of the two parties in the 50-50 Senate.

     What Ketanji Brown Jackson might be grilled about in her Supreme Court confirmation hearings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has already appeared before the Senate three times in confirmation proceedings for prior roles.
But several days of hearings for her Supreme Court nomination this week will be the highest-profile -- and likely most contentious -- grilling that Jackson has faced from lawmakers.
Expect Democrats to note that Trump nominee and now Justice Amy Coney Barrett also dodged the court expansion question when she was testifying in her Supreme Court confirmation hearing.
The advocacy came in the form of amici briefs , penned while an attorney at the firm Morrison &amp; Foerster, supporting detainees in cases before the Supreme Court.
But as a district court judge, she halted the Trump administration's attempts to block federal funding to Planned Parenthood.
