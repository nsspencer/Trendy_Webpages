     Rafael Nadal survives Carlos Alcaraz and swirling wind over three-plus hours in moving to 20-0 on the year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At Indian Wells on Saturday, three-time BNP Paribas Open champion Rafael Nadal needed every bit of his experience to keep his perfect 2022 season intact during a semifinal battle lasting 3 hours and 12 minutes.
Taking on a worthy competitor 17 years his junior, Nadal fought off the challenge of Carlos Alcaraz and a lengthy dose of swirling wind to prevail, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, in improving to 20-0 on the season.
"In the second, the conditions became crazy, honestly," summed up Nadal to Paul Annacone.
Nadal initially trailed by an early break before working his way into the match and breaking at the end to grab a one-set advantage.
Early in the second set, gusts picked up in pace, favoring the returner.

     Rafael Nadal vs. Carlos Alcaraz - What happened in their first meeting?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz are battling in the Indian Wells semi-finals.
Last year, Alcaraz passed the first obstacle at Caja Magica to become the youngest winner of a match at Madrid Masters ahead of Nadal.
Rafael Nadal lost three games against Carlos Alcaraz in Madrid 2021.
Nadal forced the opponent's error in the second game to secure the first break before Carlos suffered that injury in the next game that took the rhythm away from him.
He received the medical timeout and lost the third game when Rafa placed a volley winner.
