    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">

Davidson led by as many as five points with under six minutes left to go before Michigan State ripped off a 16-3 run to take a 67-59 edge with under a minute remaining.
Michigan State forward Joey Hauser had his best game of the season, scoring 27 points on 9-of-12 shooting and adding eight rebounds.

     March Madness 2022: Michigan State survives, edges Davidson 74-73 in NCAAs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michigan State was tough enough to take back the lead in a critical moment, then fortunate enough to withstand Davidson's desperate final charge.
Seeded seventh in the West Region, Michigan State (23-12) had to wrestle away control of a tight game against the Wildcats in the second half.
The Wildcats lost to Richmond in the A-10 tournament final but did enough to earn the second at-large tournament bid in program history.
Michigan State: The Spartans opened the year unranked, then spent 12 weeks in the Top 25 and peaked at No.
Michigan State lost seven of 10 to close the regular season, then lost to Purdue in the Big Ten Tournament semifinals.

     Late run by MSU basketball delivers knockout punch to Davidson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Davidson answered the layup with two gimmes of its own to go up 56-51 with 6:51 left, its largest lead of the game.
The pro-Wildcat crowd reached a fevered pitch as the Spartans grasped for the ropes, but Michigan State did not fall.
After the second layup, Hoggard took the inbounds pass coast-to-coast in seven seconds and finished another contested layup to make it a one-possession game.
The change in intensity from MSU started with Hoggard’s change in mindset down the stretch.
As the season was slipping through the Spartans’ fingertips, Hoggard took it upon himself to be the aggressor.

But Michigan State, favored by a point going into the game, ended up being exactly one point better.
The pregame storyline focused mostly on Foster Loyer, a former Michigan Mr. Basketball who started his collegiate career at Michigan State.
Loyer’s first shot of the game was an airball, and Michigan State took advantage of him a few times underneath.
The Michigan State alum was at the game, played just two hours from Charlotte, and visited the Michigan State players afterward.
