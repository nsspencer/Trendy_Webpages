     Summary: Martin Keown and Joe Cole have disagreed on what they believe the outcome will be in the Premier League top four race after Arsenal's latest victory against Aston Villa.
Arsenal are in the box seat I know, but when you look at the fixtures, games away at Chelsea, Spurs.
Palace next, there’s a lot of tough games coming up.
They’ve won five games on the bounce away from home, they’re showing they are resilient and that they’re a different Arsenal.
Meanwhile, alongside former Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor, Joe Cole has picked Arteta's side to make the final cut.

     Saka strike enough to earn Arsenal win at Villa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BIRMINGHAM, England, March 19 (Reuters) - Fourth-placed Arsenal opened up a four-point gap over Manchester United, one place below, in the Premier League standings after Bukayo Saka's first-half strike earned them a 1-0 victory at Aston Villa on Saturday.
Their fine, flowing first-half football deserved more than the one goal given to them by Saka on the half-hour mark -- Arsenal's 2,000th Premier League strike.
"It was a big win," Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta said.
We did not get that second goal today.
Smith Rowe fired over early on from a great position, before he set up Thomas Partey, whose strike was too close to Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.

     Summary: Not for nothing were the Arsenal faithful crying out loud that they are "on their way to the Champions League."
When Arsenal clicked into gear they were simply too much for this exceedingly ordinary Villa side to deal with.
With and without the ball Villa were off the pace.
It took Steven Gerrard's side an hour to take a shot on goal, John McGinn bending wide from outside the box.
"Arsenal played really well, controlled a lot of the first half and we had too much respect for them.
