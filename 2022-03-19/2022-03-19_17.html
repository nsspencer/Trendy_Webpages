     Phillies’ Aaron Nola gives up two solo homers, strikes out five in first spring start
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He ripped a two-out RBI double in the first inning against Blue Jays starter Nick Allgeyer, then drew an eight-pitch walk in the third.
It was a part of an inning in which Bryce Harper and Didi Gregorius also worked over Allgeyer by drawing walks.
Neither would’ve been notable if Nola hadn’t led the league with 82 two-strike hits last season.
Nola is in line for his fifth consecutive opening-day start If Zack Wheeler isn’t ready to go.

     Phillies blockbuster signings show trust in Bryson Stott

     Summary: The Phillies seem to think Bryson Stott is their long-term shortstop.
In a matter of days, the Philadelphia Phillies made two blockbuster outfield free agent signings — Nick Castellanos (five years, $100 million) and Kyle Schwarber (four years, $79 million).
Bryce Harper woke up to the news of the Nick Castellanos signing this morning.
He said he told Bryson Stott that it’s a “good day to be a Phillie.” pic.twitter.com/QmIxtVQ04P — Alex Coffey (@byalexcoffey) March 19, 2022The Phillies chose to “roll the dice” with the struggling Didi Gregorius and high-ranked prospect Bryson Stott, which shows trust in the latter going into the 2022 season and beyond, when Gregorius’ contract is up at the end of this year.
While signings like Schwarber and Castellanos are franchise-altering, it is likewise important that the Phillies continue to prioritize building from within.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Up and down the lineup, Phillies players should feel less pressure.
Very fair price for the PhilsThe Phillies brought in Schwarber and Castellanos on deals worth a combined $179 million over nine years.
Defensive limitationsThere’s no denying this Phillies team skews offensive.
They’re positioned well to do so with Harper, Castellanos, Schwarber, Hoskins, Realmuto and Segura in the same lineup.
Draft picksThe Phillies forfeit their second-round pick for signing Castellanos because he was extended a qualifying offer by his former team, the Reds.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first thing I saw was about Nick Castellanos signing with the Phillies, and I wrote it off as a joke.
The Phillies saw an All-Star free agent who could make the lineup better, and they paid him like the All-Star he is.
The luxury tax threshold is not a salary cap, but until now, the Phillies have always treated it as such.
The Nick Castellanos signing feels really, really good, and I can’t wait for this good feeling to carry into the regular season.
Nick Castellanos will mash, the Phillies will score, and we’re done complaining about the stupid luxury tax threshold (at least for now).

(Rich von Biberstein/Icon Sportswire)When Bryce Harper went to bed last night, he knew that the Philadelphia Phillies had improved their lineup this week with the addition of Kyle Schwarber.
The signing not only adds two guys who can mash into a lineup that already included Harper, Rhys Hoskins, J.T.
It’s a special thing being able to have guys at the top of our lineup and the middle of our lineup … it’s pretty well-rounded, just the length of our lineup is very impressive.
It just goes to show that this organization wants to win, they are committed to winning and I’m pretty excited right now.”MORE FROM PHILLIES NATION

And Chavez Smith lost track of a ball in center field, which lead to the Phillies getting their 3rd run.

     AP source: Castellanos, Phillies agree to $100M, 5-year deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Free-agent slugger Nick Castellanos and the Philadelphia Phillies have agreed to a $100 million, five-year contract, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.
Kyle Schwarber agreed Wednesday to a four-year contract worth about $80 million, a deal that also was pending a successful physical.
Back in November, Castellanos opted out of the last two years of his contract with Cincinnati, which would have paid him $34 million.
Since the Major League Baseball lockout ended, the Phillies have signed free-agent relievers Brad Hand and Jeurys Familia, each to a one-year deal for $6 million.
In another move Friday involving the Phillies, the team lost right-hander Yoan López when he was claimed off waivers by the Miami Marlins.
