     Epic is donating two weeks of Fortnite proceeds to Ukraine relief
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A new season of Fortnite is launching today, and developer Epic will be donating all of its proceeds from the first two weeks to Ukraine-related humanitarian efforts.
(Epic notes that “using V-Bucks in Fortnite will not be included as those are not real-money purchases.)
It will also include retail gift card purchases so long as they’re redeemed during the two-week window.
As transactions are reported, we’ll log them and send the funds to the humanitarian relief organizations within days.”The news comes as other gaming-related efforts have managed to raise millions of dollars for humanitarian relief following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The new season of Fortnite starts later today, and follows a dramatic event that kicked off a whole new chapter last December.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 2 patch notes have arrived and what a season we have in store.
Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 2: ResistanceRumours abound that a season that depicted an all-out war between Fortnite's cast of characters may be delayed or scrapped entirely has been misguided as that is exactly what is in store for players in Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 2.
Of course, there is also the brand new Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 2 Battle Pass which is chock full of cosmetic rewards to unlock.
Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 2: MapSo far, we only have an unmarked map and - at first glance - it doesn't look like there are major changes compared to the one we left in Chapter 3 Season 2.
We will continue to update this page as more information becomes available for Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 2.
