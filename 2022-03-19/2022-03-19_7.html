     In a Twist, Carlos Correa Heads North to the Minnesota Twins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Carlos Correa, the star shortstop who helped lead the Houston Astros to a now tainted 2017 World Series title, has found an unexpected home: the Minnesota Twins.
Instead of landing the massive long-term deal that was once predicted for him, Correa agreed to join the rapidly rebuilding Twins on a three-year $105.3 million contract.
The details of the contract were confirmed by a personal familiar with the negotiations who was not authorized to discuss it publicly because it was pending a physical examination.
While the deal is far smaller in length and total value than some handed out before the lockout, the benefits to Correa are clear: It has opt-outs after each of the first two years, allowing Correa to re-enter the market as soon as next season, and it has an average annual value of $35.1 million, which supplants the deal Anthony Rendon of the Los Angeles Angels signed two years ago, which was previously the highest mark for an infielder.

     Detroit Tigers miss out on Carlos Correa; fans should be irate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Detroit Red Wings: 6 players that could be on the move by Monday by Bob HeyrmanMany Detroit Tigers fans, including myself, woke up irate this morning finding out that 27-year old star shortstop Carlos Correa signed a three-year deal with the Minnesota Twins.
This was after Detroit Tigers manager A.J.
Detroit Tigers general manager Al Avila made a similar deal with Opening Day starter Eduardo Rodriquez.
The three-year $105.3 million deal Correa signed can be a one-year deal worth $35.1 million.
Detroit Tigers fans should be furious with Al Avila for not offering something similar to Carlos Correa.

     Carlos Correa, Minnesota Twins agree to 3-year, $105.3 million deal with opt-outs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jeff Passan shares his surprise about Carlos Correa agreeing to a contract with the Twins.
(0:55)Passan: Carlos Correa to the Twins one of the biggest surprises of MLB free agency (0:55)Shortstop Carlos Correa and the Minnesota Twins are in agreement on a three-year, $105.3 million contract that includes opt-outs after the first two seasons, sources confirmed to ESPN's Jeff Passan.
Correa picking the Twins was a surprise, given they have lost 18 consecutive postseason games and finished last in the AL Central a year ago at 73-89.
His average salary becomes baseball's fourth highest behind Mets pitcher Max Scherzer ($43.3 million), Yankees pitcher Gerrit Cole ($36 million) and Angels outfielder Mike Trout ($35.5 million).
Minnesota has not been to the World Series since winning the 1991 title and has lost its past eight postseason series since beating Oakland in a 2002 AL Division Series.

     Summary: It’s rare to see a baseball transaction with such a perfect match between timing and substance.
The substance was an opt-out-laden, three-year, $105.3-million deal between the Twins and Carlos Correa.
Credit to Minnesota and Correa for making sure that it was so literally as well as spiritually.
And within a few days, by adding Correa, the team showed that it was ready to use that newfound financial flexibility to actually stretch.

     How Carlos Correa became latest Astros free agent to leave
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The three-year, $105.3 million deal contains two opt-out clauses, allowing Correa to explore free-agency again as early as November.
We understand this is a business and we also know he’s a guy that got paid.
According to Correa, Astros officials told him last spring the team does not believe in them.
Houston offered him a five-year, $160 million deal during their exclusive, five-day negotiating window following the World Series.
Corey Seager’s 10-year, $325 million deal with the Texas Rangers established the benchmark to which Correa should have strived.
