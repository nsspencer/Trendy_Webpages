     Arizona Basketball: 3 keys to Wildcats beating TCU in Round of 32
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After an 87-70 win over Wright State, Arizona Basketball is poised for a second-round game against TCU on Sunday.
TCU got here by way of a 69-42 win over Seton Hall in the final game on Friday night.
In their win over Wright State, Arizona had a balanced attack with five players in double figures, led by Christian Koloko who had 20 points and 11 rebounds.
Early in the second half, Wright State cut the lead to as low as six before Arizona started running things through their big men and pulling away.
That scare may help them as they prepare for the game against TCU, coach Tommy Lloyd will have some teaching moments to get them refocused.

     Summary: The Arizona Wildcats were happy to get past Wright State but they know they need to play better to keep advancing in the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.
Yet when the Arizona Wildcats took the court at Viejas Arena against Wright State, it was graduate transfer Justin Kier starting in his place.
16 seed Wright State, the Wildcats held the 12th-best assist-to-turnover ratio in Division I: 1.5.
And he made some really good decisions.”Without Kriisa, the point guard position is very fluid for Arizona.
