     Texas basketball falls to Purdue thanks to 46 free-throw attempts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Texas took on a tough opponent in the three-seed Purdue Boilermakers, who were the No.
Thus, Purdue got to the free-throw line at a near record-breaking volume in this game.
Purdue got 46 free-throw attempts to Texas’ 12, which is the biggest discrepancy in the NCAA Tournament in the last decade.
Purdue was also just the third team to get to the line at least 46 times in one NCAA Tournament game since 2010.
This was also the biggest FT discrepancy of any tournament game in the last decade.
