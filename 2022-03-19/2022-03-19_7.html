     Summary: Paddy Pimblett has silenced any doubts Dana White may have had about him.
He needs to win, you know?” White said at the UFC London post-fight press conference.
This kid’s got a ton of hype behind him and tonight he showed everybody that he’s the real deal.”Pimblett certainly believes himself to be just that.
After his win, Pimblett said that he deserves to be in main events and that he could sell out a stadium show with ease.
On the latter point, White was less interested, but he does believe that Pimblett is now a main event fighter.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paddy Pimblett is carving out a reputation for taking his licks and doubling up on the return.
Pimblett scored a first-round submission win over Rodrigo Vargas on the main card of UFC London at the O2 Arena.
Pimblett (18-3) had a rough start on Saturday night, absorbing an early knockdown from the major underdog Vargas (12-5).
Luigi Vendramini put Pimblett in serious danger early in the round before Pimblett turned the tide later into the stanza.
It's too small," Pimblett told UFC commentator Michael Bisping in the post-fight interview.

     Paddy Pimblett delivers on home soil as rising star secures first round submission win at UFC London
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tom Aspinall may be headlining UFC London but all eyes have been on Paddy Pimblett this week, and the UFC's hottest rising star did not disappoint on home soil.
Pimblett says he is never in a boring fight and although his clash with Kazula Vargas ended inside the first round, it certainly delivered.
From that position, Pimblett worked his way to his rival's back and that was all she wrote from there, sinking in a deep rear naked choke and forcing the tap.
Party time ensued in the O2 Arena, while Next Gen team-mate Molly McCann tore into the Octagon to congratulate her friend - having defeated Luana Carolina earlier on the card.
McCann - a huge Everton fan - was seen celebrating with former Toffees and Manchester United star Wayne Rooney immediately after Pimblett's win.

     Summary: LONDON — Tom Aspinall looked the real deal at the O2 Arena on Saturday night, as British fight fans finally got their regular fix of UFC live action back following the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Aspinall needed less than one round to tap out heavyweight contender Alexander Volkov in the Fight Night main event, in what was his first contest under Dana White's banner to have a live crowd present.
Arnold Allen also took out experienced big-stage opposition in round number one in the co-main, inflicting a breathless flurry upon Dan Hooker until the referee stepped in.
Meanwhile, Liverpool duo Paddy 'The Baddy' Pimblett and Molly 'Meatball' McCann continued their rises with emphatic victories.
