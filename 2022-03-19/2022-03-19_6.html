     Bahrain Grand Prix: Ferrari dominates as Charles Leclerc wins dramatic season opener
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Charles Leclerc won the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday as Ferrari claimed a one-two after a dramatic ending to the first race of the new season.
Leclerc had started in pole position after an impressive qualifying and, after a battle with reigning world champion Max Verstappen, looked to be cruising to victory.
That was until a safety car was deployed in the closing stages which saw the pack bunch up for the restart.
As per the new regulations, all cars were able to unlap themselves before racing started again -- a rule clarified after the dramatic ending in last year's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix which saw Lewis Hamilton lose the title on the final lapIn Bahrain, Leclerc held on to the lead after the restart with Verstappen hot on his tail but the Red Bull driver -- who was already complaining about a steering issue with his car -- dropped out of the race entirely after appearing to lose power.

     Charles Leclerc Leads Ferrari 1-2 at Bahrain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2022 preseason testing, their cars looked fast enough to raise some questions that Ferrari could get back to its winning ways at some point this season.
Charles Leclerc dominated today's Formula 1 race at Bahrain from pole, leaping out to an early lead and looking back only to win a brief, dramatic on-track battle with reigning world champion Max Verstappen after his first pit stop.
Carlos Sainz Jr. ran third the entire race, but Max Verstappen reported issues in his car after his final pit stop.
Verstappen held second after a safety car restart, but he eventually lost the spot to Sainz.
In their brief battle for the lead, Leclerc and Verstappen showed the exciting potential of the new car.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The pair battled brilliantly for several laps, something which we will certainly be seeing a lot more of this season.
This gap disintegrated however when a late Safety Car was brought out due to a fiery Scuderia AlphaTauri.
To be back on top with a car that is capable of winning feels incredible.
Once the Safety Car came out, we lost the gap we had created and had to start again from zero.
Car development will be more significant than in previous years and we have to stay on top of our game.
