     Wolff says Red Bull 'in a league of their own' – as Horner admits he expected to be on the back foot in 2022
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Qualifying for the Bahrain Grand Prix is still to come but Mercedes have almost counted themselves out of pole position and victory in the opening race.
Wolff’s examination of his team’s prospects – after two free practice sessions that saw Ferrari and Red Bull get on the pace – was stark.
Red Bull are in a league of their own, then there is bunch of teams in the corridor of fuel weight and engine modes.
“But even there, it’s great to see teams like [Alfa Romeo] and [Alpine] are right there in the free practice sessions.
I personally believe there are simple solutions to get the performance back, that will start to crystallise, and it’s 23 races.

     Summary: Charles Leclerc starts the season-opening 2022 Bahrain Grand Prix on the front row ahead of defending world champion Max Verstappen.
Hamilton expressed relief at fifth, admitting his focus now is not catching those ahead but keeping those behind in check.
“The guys ahead of us are in another league.”Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff explained before qualifying the extent of the problems.
Since the new cars were conceived with close racing in mind, the Bahrain Grand Prix is flush with exquisite possibilities.
“The results of the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and the FIA Formula One World Championship are valid, final and cannot now be changed.

FP3 starts at 12pm GMT (3pm local time) and will run for one hour, with qualifying taking place at 3pm GMT (6pm local time) and will also run for one hour.
