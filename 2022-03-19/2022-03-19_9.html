     Russia claims to use a hypersonic missile in attack on arms depot in Ukraine.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Russia has fired scores of guided missiles into Ukraine, but on Saturday it claimed for the first time that it had launched one capable of hypersonic speed in an attack on an ammunition depot in western Ukraine.
The report could not be independently verified, but if true could be the first use of a hypersonic weapon in combat.
Hypersonics, generally defined as weapons capable of flying at speeds over Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound, are at the center of an arms race among the United States, Russia and China.
The United States has pursued development of this type of weapon since the early 2000s, focusing on two different variants, according to a report released Thursday by the Congressional Research Service.
The Pentagon requested $3.8 billion for hypersonic research in fiscal year 2022.

     Russia says it used a hypersonic missile in Ukraine for first time: report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russian defense ministry officials said the country used a new hypersonic missile in an attack on Ukraine on Friday, marking its first use in combat.
The hypersonic missile, called Kinzhal ("Dagger" in Russian), was used in an attack on a large underground warehouse in southwestern Ukraine, according to Bloomberg News, which cited that Russia's claim had yet to be independently verified.
The United States, Russia, China and North Korea have been developing hypersonic weapons, some of which are launched into space, in pursuit of long-range flight and maneuverability.
North Korea claims to have tested its hypersonic missile this year.
Last August, China reportedly launched a hypersonic missile test on a Long March rocket, with the U.S. military testing hypersonic technology in a series of small rocket launches in October.

Russia’s Interfax news agency said it was the first time Russia had deployed the hypersonic Kinzhal system since it sent its troops into Ukraine on February 24.
‘Kamikaze drones’Russia prides itself on its advanced weaponry, and President Vladimir Putin said in December that Russia was the global leader in hypersonic missiles, whose speed, manoeuvrability and altitude make them difficult to track and intercept.
Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said because of the nature of war, new weapons systems are often used.
This is the first time we are hearing confirmation about the use of hypersonic missiles.”Russia first used the hypersonic missile during its military campaign in Syria in 2016.

"The Kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse of missiles and aviation ammunition of Ukrainian troops in the village of Delyatyn, Ivano-Frankivsk region," he said, according to news agency RIA.
Konashenkov also said Russian forces had used the Bastion anti-ship missile system to strike Ukrainian military facilities near the Black Sea port of Odesa.
It was unclear if the missiles allegedly used on Friday were the same model.

     Summary: There are two main categories of hypersonic weapons: hypersonic glide vehicles and hypersonic cruise missiles.
The ability to launch highly maneuverable weapons at hypersonic speeds gives any country a considerable advantage, because such weapons can evade just about any defense system currently in use.
Additional countries are conducting research on weapons, while others have made claims about testing hypersonic weapons that cannot yet be verified.
In 2018, President Vladimir Putin boasted about the Kinzhal hypersonic missile and the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle.
ChinaU.S. military and intelligence officials say China is pursuing hypersonic cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles, and that at least one missile capable of carrying hypersonic glide vehicles may now be in use.
