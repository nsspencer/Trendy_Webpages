     Notre Dame basketball: This Irish MBB team is built for the NCAA Tournament
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Matt Cashore-USA TODAY SportsThe Notre Dame basketball team has had an exciting season, but in the first two games of their NCAA Tournament slate, they have proven they belong.
After a stellar 2021-22 regular season that saw the Notre Dame basketball team finish with the No.
2 seed in the ACC Tournament, many felt they were a given to make the Field of 64 of the 2022 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.
Notre Dame basketball could go on a serious runThe next matchup will come Sunday, as they draw the No.
Hopefully, there is a ton of basketball left, and what the 2021-22 team did was bring the Irish Men’s Basketball program back to national relevancy.

     Alabama basketball: After limping to finish line, where do Nate Oats, Tide go from here?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s certainly reason to be disappointed that Bama’s NCAA Tournament run is done right about the time it was getting started.
An early exit in the NCAA Tournament seemed like the most likely end to Bama’s season leading up to March.
Oats’ team did nothing but frustrate his fans because he showed them just what his crew could be.
Oats is quick to note that Alabama made consecutive runs to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2005-2006.
Sure, Kentucky is massively and probably even more disappointed by its early, historic exit in the NCAA Tournament, but upsets happen.
