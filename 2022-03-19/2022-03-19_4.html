     Kansas basketball ties Kentucky’s all-time win record with NCAA Tournament win vs. Creighton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FORT WORTH, TX — As Kansas men’s basketball coach Bill Self previewed his team’s NCAA Tournament game against Creighton, he downplayed the significance of potentially tying Kentucky for the lead in all-time wins.
But for Self, that came from a desire to see Kansas continue to advance in the NCAA Tournament, nothing else.
The Jayhawks have certainly been able to benefit, in this respect, from the Wildcats’ being eliminated from the NCAA Tournament in the first round.
Coming into the game, Creighton had been averaging 6.6 makes on 21.6 attempts from behind the arc each game, and Kansas had been allowing 6.1 makes on 20.3 attempts from behind the arc per game.
That means, combined across the opening games of the tournament, Agbaji is shooting 35.7% from the field and 25% from behind the arc.

     Kansas Jayhawks coach Bill Self relieved after 2nd round win | The Kansas City Star
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With one minute to play in its second-round NCAA Tournament game against Creighton on Saturday, Kansas looked as if it might emerge as the second No.
8 seed North Carolina at Dickies Arena, the Jayhawks, the top seed in the Midwest, outscored No.
9 seed Creighton 6-0 in the last 55 seconds to escape with a 79-72 victory.
“I’m a little relieved, but I’m also very happy,” KU coach Bill Self said after the Jayhawks (30-6) advanced to their first Sweet 16 since the 2017-18 season.
“I heard ‘Mac’ (Creighton coach Greg McDermott) say before the game they’re going to let it fly, and they did,” Self said.

     How UK basketball lost its all-time wins lead over Kansas | Lexington Herald Leader
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KU’s catching UK capped a relentless march toward the all-time wins lead by Bill Self’s program.
Last season, when John Calipari and UK went 9-16 and Self and KU were 21-9, also significantly eroded Kentucky’s all-time wins lead.
The UK program had been the all-time wins leader ever since.
Obviously, Kansas vacating prior wins or receiving sanctions of such severity that its future competitiveness is compromised could have implications in the all-time wins battle.
Kansas can supplant Kentucky as the all-time wins leader when the Jayhawks face Midwest Region No.
