     Summary: We were well aware of it for a while now, and it's definitely been wearing on us,” Dickinson said.
The Wolverines beat a Tennessee team that hadn’t lost in a month and had dropped just one game since Feb. 1, and earned a spot in the Sweet 16 in the process.
Dickinson and Brooks combined for 50 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists, and each played more than 37 minutes.
But the story today is Michigan, a team that has had many opportunities to fracture this season.

     An unlikely Cinderella story in the 2022 NCAA tournament: Michigan basketball
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The double-digit seed Michigan Wolverines are that strange, blue-blooded Cinderella team this March.
With early season losses to Minnesota, UCF, Seton Hall and Rutgers, it began to settle in that maybe, just maybe this Michigan team could miss the NCAA Tournament.
That win against the Buckeyes was likely what got Michigan in the NCAA tournament in the first place.
This team has been through hell and back all season long, but they are somehow 2-0 in the NCAA Tournament.
They may be one of the normal premier programs in college basketball, but there is nothing normal about Michigan basketball this season.
