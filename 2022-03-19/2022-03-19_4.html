     Kansas basketball ties Kentucky’s all-time win record with NCAA Tournament win vs. Creighton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FORT WORTH, TX — As Kansas men’s basketball coach Bill Self previewed his team’s NCAA Tournament game against Creighton, he downplayed the significance of potentially tying Kentucky for the lead in all-time wins.
But for Self, that came from a desire to see Kansas continue to advance in the NCAA Tournament, nothing else.
The Jayhawks have certainly been able to benefit, in this respect, from the Wildcats’ being eliminated from the NCAA Tournament in the first round.
Coming into the game, Creighton had been averaging 6.6 makes on 21.6 attempts from behind the arc each game, and Kansas had been allowing 6.1 makes on 20.3 attempts from behind the arc per game.
That means, combined across the opening games of the tournament, Agbaji is shooting 35.7% from the field and 25% from behind the arc.

     Summary: Fort Worth, Texas — Creighton coach Greg McDermott called it a chess match because of the way his team defended.
Kansas coach Bill Self said winning NCAA Tournament games is never something for which one should apologize.
For one, that was the time when Kansas made the biggest plays of the game while watching the Bluejays (23-12) come up short.
The Agbaji play came at the end of a long day of shooting the ball.
Kansas trailed when he checked in with 14:13 to play in the first half but went ahead just 29 seconds later.

     How UK basketball lost its all-time wins lead over Kansas | Lexington Herald Leader
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: KU’s catching UK capped a relentless march toward the all-time wins lead by Bill Self’s program.
Last season, when John Calipari and UK went 9-16 and Self and KU were 21-9, also significantly eroded Kentucky’s all-time wins lead.
The UK program had been the all-time wins leader ever since.
Obviously, Kansas vacating prior wins or receiving sanctions of such severity that its future competitiveness is compromised could have implications in the all-time wins battle.
Kansas can supplant Kentucky as the all-time wins leader when the Jayhawks face Midwest Region No.
