     Stand With Ukraine Humble Bundle has already raised over £3 million for charity
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's only been a day, but already Humble Bundle's Stand with Ukraine bundle, has already generated over £3 million to aid humanitarian efforts following Russia's violent and illegal invasion of Ukraine.
100 per cent of the proceeds will go to Razom for Ukraine, International Rescue Committee, International Medical Corps, and Direct Relief to "support vital humanitarian crisis relief efforts for the people of Ukraine today".
"The violent and unlawful invasion in Ukraine is taking a tragic toll-displacing people, devastating families, and creating an urgent need for food, water, supplies, shelter, and safety," Humble explained at the time the bundle was announced.
There's still time to grab the Stand With Ukraine bundle.
As Matt told us earlier this week, Humble Games' announcement follows significant donations and fundraising efforts across the industry in support of Ukraine.

     Humble Bundle For Ukraine Has Raised $5.3 Million In Less Than A Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Humble Bundle's Stand with Ukraine bundle has proven to be a huge success - less than 24 hours since it went live.
The bundle has already raised over $5 million, and it still has six days to go for those who are yet to bag this great deal, which will also help those affected by the invasion of Ukraine.
Purchasers can choose to donate more than the base $40, ensuring that the four charities being aided by the bundle receive as much fundraising as possible.
As the bundle closes off its first day on the site, the donations show no sign of slowing down.
In the time it has taken me to write this article, another $100,000 was raised and I had to update the headline.

     Two Massive Charity Game Bundles Have Now Raised Over $12 Million For Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Indie digital storefront Itch.io has raised over $6 million via its recently ended Bundle for Ukraine charity package.
Meanwhile, Humble Bundle’s similarly large collection of games and comics has already raised over $6 million as well, with six days left before it ends.
That’s a massive amount of money, all of it going to support folks suffering during the horrific Russian invasion of Ukraine.
This package was available on Itch.io starting on March 7 and collected nearly 1,000 games into a single, massive package.
That goal was smashed quickly and after only 24 hours the indie bundle had already raised just over $1.5 million.
