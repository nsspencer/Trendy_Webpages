     Rafael Nadal survives Carlos Alcaraz and swirling wind over three-plus hours in moving to 20-0 on the year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At Indian Wells on Saturday, three-time BNP Paribas Open champion Rafael Nadal needed every bit of his experience to keep his perfect 2022 season intact during a semifinal battle lasting 3 hours and 12 minutes.
Taking on a worthy competitor 17 years his junior, Nadal fought off the challenge of Carlos Alcaraz and a lengthy dose of swirling wind to prevail, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, in improving to 20-0 on the season.
"In the second, the conditions became crazy, honestly," summed up Nadal to Paul Annacone.
Nadal initially trailed by an early break before working his way into the match and breaking at the end to grab a one-set advantage.
Early in the second set, gusts picked up in pace, favoring the returner.

     'Rafael Nadal tries to figure everything out', says top coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rafael Nadal survived a nearly three-hour battle against Nick Kyrgios in Indian Wells, prevailing at a distance thanks to a score of 7-6 (0) 5-7 6-4.
This led Annacone to believe that Nadal was adjusting his playing style, being more aggressive as he went along.
During the post-match press conference after his quarterfinal win, an interviewer asked the Spaniard what it’ll take to beat Rafael Nadal in the semifinal.
Alcaraz said, “I don’t know, honestly I think so, my level, I think I’m playing a great level in this tournament.
Yeah I know it’s going to be a really tough, tough match but everybody knows how’s Rafa’s game and he has a thousand lives in the match when he’s down, so he can turn (*struggling with the English word) … around the game”.
