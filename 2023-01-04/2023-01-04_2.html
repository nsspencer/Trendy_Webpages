     Salesforce to cut workforce by 10% after hiring ‘too many people’ during the pandemic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Similar to other companies hit by significant layoffs over the past year, Benioff added that Salesforce had hired too many people through the pandemic during the boom times.
For context, the company claimed 79,000 employees last February, a 30% increase on 2020.
Certainly, Salesforce revealed an initial round of layoffs in early November affecting “hundreds” of workers, with co-CEO and co-chair Bret Taylor announcing shortly after that he would be stepping down.
The company also refused to provide a revenue forecast for 2023 at it most recent earnings report last year.
Salesforce said that the restructuring effort will cost it between $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion, which it expects to incur in Q4 of fiscal 2023.

     Salesforce is cutting 10% of its personnel, more than 7,000 employees
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Salesforce is cutting 10% of its personnel and reducing some office space as part of a restructuring plan, the company announced Wednesday.
The cuts mark the latest round of departures at the cloud-based software company, the largest private employer in San Francisco.
Days later, the company announced the departure of Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield, who joined Salesforce as part of its biggest acquisition ever.
Now, like many other major tech companies, Salesforce is looking to cut costs as it contends with slowing revenue growth and a weakening economy.
Salesforce said it expects its employee restructuring to be complete by the end of the 2024 fiscal year and real estate restructuring to finish in the 2026 fiscal year.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Salesforce is laying off about 10% of its workforce in the latest round of job cuts in the tech industry as corporations cut back on software and other spending.
The San Francisco cloud computing software company will also be closing some offices, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday.
The company anticipates $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion in charges related to its plan.
That includes $1 billion to $1.4 billion in charges tied to employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation.
Tech companies hired aggressively during the pandemic to keep up with soaring demand, but Salesforce had been growing rapidly since at least 2018.

     Summary: CNN —Salesforce said Wednesday that it will cut approximately 10% of its workforce and reduce its real estate footprint, making it the latest tech company to slash expenses as broader economic uncertainty continues to hit Silicon Valley particularly hard.
“I’ve been thinking a lot about how we came to this moment,” Benioff wrote.
Also on Wednesday, video-sharing platform Vimeo said in a regulatory filing that it would cut approximately 11% of its workforce.
Like Benioff, a number of other tech founders and CEOs have since admitted they failed to accurately gauge pandemic demand.
And most of all, please lean on your leadership, including me, as we work through this difficult time together.”
