     Bryan Kohberger is on his way to Idaho to face murder charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: STROUDSBURG, Pa. – Idaho suspect Bryan Christopher Kohberger is on his way to Moscow to face charges for the murders of four University of Idaho students, a source told Fox News.
A law enforcement source told Fox News' Alexis McAdams that Idaho and Pennsylvania authorities are working together on returning him to Moscow.
IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT: WHO IS BRYAN CHRISTOPHER KOHBERGERThe teaching assistant, who studies in the university's department of criminal justice and criminology, had been living in Pullman, Washington, in an on-campus apartment – a 10-minute drive from the rental home where four University of Idaho students were stabbed to death.
IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT KOHBERGER'S PENNSYLVANIA CLASSMATES SAY HE WAS ‘BRIGHT,’ AWKWARD, BULLIED IN SCHOOLAs police desperately searched for a suspect, Kohberger wrapped up the semester, then drove cross-country with his father in his white Hyundai Elantra to Pennsylvania for winter break.
Kohberger could face the death penalty if convicted of four counts of first-degree murder and one count of felony burglary.

     Bryan Kohberger On His Way Back to Idaho to Face Murder Charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bryan Kohberger is on his way back to Idaho to face murder charges, a day after he told a Pennsylvania judge he would not fight extradition.
Kohberger was moved from the Monroe County Correctional Facility at around 6 AM ET.
Pennsylvania State Police said he will fly back to Idaho, although no one has said if he'd fly commercial.
He should face a judge in a day or 2 to answer to the 4 charges of first-degree murder.
As you see, their car had Washington plates, and Washington is contiguous with Idaho.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marshals Service, spent a quarter of a century with the agency that tracks down fugitives.
In an extended interview with Law&amp;Crime’s Sidebar podcast, Roderick explained that officials do not plan a criminal defendant’s movements carelessly.
A request “might” have been made to the Marshals Service in advance of his extradition hearing, which was due Tuesday, Roderick explained.
Marshals Service helms the transportation of prisoners within the United States, handling “about 260,000 by aircraft,” Roderick explained.
“Marshals Service or any other entity does not talk about transportation issues or security issues or when an individual’s being moved,” Roderick explained.

     Bryan Kohberger update: Idaho murder suspect no longer held in PA after court appearance
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A jail official told ABC News about 9 a.m. EST Wednesday that Kohberger was no longer lodged at the Monroe County, Pennsylvania jail.
More details about the case are expected to be released after Kohberger arrives in Idaho and an affidavit is unsealed.
Latah County prosecutors in Idaho have said they believe Kohberger broke into the victims' home near the university campus intending to commit murder.
Pennsylvania State Police Maj. Christopher Paris said Tuesday that Kohberger's warrant merited an after-dark arrest, which requires a higher standard of probable cause.
The investigators are also interviewing people who knew Kohberger, including those at Washington State University, the official said.
