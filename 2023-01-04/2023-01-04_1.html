     Bryan Kohberger Is Keen to Know What's in Sealed Affidavits—Prosecutor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bryan Kohberger, 28, agreed on Tuesday to be extradited from Pennsylvania, where he was arrested at his parents' home on Friday, to face charges in Idaho.
The probable cause affidavit outlining the evidence for first-degree murder and felony burglary charges against Kohberger won't be released until after he arrives in Idaho, authorities said.
Jason LaBar, the chief public defender in Monroe County representing Kohberger for his extradition hearing, said his client was eager to be exonerated.
Jennifer Coffindaffer, a former FBI agent, told Newsweek that she believes Kohberger wants to fight the charges against him "all the way."
During Tuesday's press conference, Pennsylvania State Police Major Christopher Paris said authorities want to transport Kohberger to Idaho "as soon as possible."

     Summary: Bryan Kohberger, a 28-year-old doctoral student at Washington State University - a short drive from the murder scene across the state border - will be transported to Idaho within 10 days.
More details about the case are expected to be released after Kohberger arrives in Idaho and an affidavit is unsealed.
Kohberger, who was arrested by state police at his parents' home in eastern Pennsylvania last Friday, will be held at a jail in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, until his extradition.
Pennsylvania State Police Maj. Christopher Paris said Tuesday that Kohberger's warrant merited an after-dark arrest, which requires a higher standard of probable cause.
The investigators are also interviewing people who knew Kohberger, including those at Washington State University, the official said.
