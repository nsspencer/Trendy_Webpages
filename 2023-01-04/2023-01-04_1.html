    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Authorities in Idaho have said they believe Kohberger broke into the victims' rental home in Moscow intending to commit murder.
Police honed in on Kohberger as the suspect in the slayings through DNA by using public genealogy databases, ABC News reported, citing law enforcement sources.

"Safest for anybody else in the house, safest for Mr. Kohberger and safest for our people."

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bryan Kohberger had an emotional moment at his extradition hearing Tuesday in Pennsylvania ... telling his family he loved them right before he was hauled back to jail.
The suspected killer of four college students had just agreed to waive extradition in Monroe County, PA, and be sent back to Idaho to face murder and burglary charges stemming from the brutal November knife attack.
There was also a moment where Kohberger locked eyes with his father, nodding at him in acknowledgment.
CNN said Kohberger looked back at his dad again and peered over at his family another time, cracking a faint smile.
Paris could not pinpoint an exact date for the extradition ... but, in the meantime, Kohberger will be cooling his heels inside the Monroe County Correctional Facility.
