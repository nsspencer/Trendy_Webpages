     Idaho murders suspect Bryan Kohberger's new defense attorney identified
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Murder suspect Bryan Kohberger, who is accused of ambushing four sleeping University of Idaho students with a "fixed-blade" knife in November, has been assigned a provisional defense attorney ahead of his return to Latah County to face a judge.
Kohberger’s Keystone State attorney, Jason LaBar, has said his client cannot afford a private lawyer and will receive a public defender when he returns to Idaho.

Several attempts to make contact were unsuccessful early Tuesday, and both the attorney and assistant did not immediately return calls.

     Bryan Kohberger: Judge issues gag order in Idaho murders case stopping police releasing information about suspect
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Under Idaho state law, officials are limited about what they can release before a suspect makes their initial court appearance.
On Tuesday, Mr Kohberger waived his extradition rights, paving the way for him to be transported from Pennsylvania to Idaho to face charges.
The footage shows Mr Kohberger’s startled face when an officer pulls the car over and approaches the door.
On Friday, police swooped in on the Kohberger family home in Chestnuthill Township, Monroe County, and arrested him for the murders.
An FBI team kept Mr Kohberger under surveillance in the area for several days before his arrest on Friday (30 December).
