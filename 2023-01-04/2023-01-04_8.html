     Summary: Logan Paul Finally Responds To Serious CyptoZoo Scam ClaimsLast month, YouTuber Coffeezilla took it upon himself to dig into the controversies surrounding Logan Paul's NFT-based game, "CryptoZoo."
Since the blockchain game's soft launch in 2021, players have reportedly been frustrated by its limited functionality.
For his own part, Logan Paul has maintained that many of Coffeezilla's findings are incorrect.
In the evening of January 3, Logan Paul posted a video to his personal YouTube channel digging into the allegations against him and "CryptoZoo."
And if this clip is anything to go by, then the feud between Logan Paul and Coffeezilla is far from over.
