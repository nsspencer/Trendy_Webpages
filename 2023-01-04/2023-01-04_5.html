     Summary: At NJPW Wrestle Kingdom 17 in Tokyo earlier today, Omega leaned into that finisher's name with a spectacular Sephiroth-themed entrance.
One Winged Angel - Rebirth from Final Fantasy VII Remake began to play, and Omega slowly made his way to the ring.

Omega defeated Ospreay with the One Winged Angel finisher to become IWGP US Champion for the second time.
Meanwhile, Sephiroth's next venture will be Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which launches this winter exclusively on PlayStation 5.

     Wrestle Kingdom 17 had the debut of Mercedes Moné, spectacle, and title changes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While I’m sure many of us who stayed up are on our second (or third) cup of coffee – New Japan’s Wrestle Kingdom 17 officially kicked off 2023 in pretty good fashion.
This was a solid show with a much-anticipated debut, a way-too-early match-of-the-year candidate, and a heavyweight championship title change that seems right given the occasion.
Mercedes Moné Has ArrivedIt was the worst-kept secret for weeks leading up to Wrestle Kingdom, but Sas...excuse me – Mercedes Moné made her debut after KAIRI beat Tam Nakano for the IWGP Women’s title.
Kenny Omega vs. Will Ospreay DeliversGoing into Wrestle Kingdom 17, this was one of the matches I was least worried about in terms of quality.
He and Jay White had another good match between them.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NJPWFor fans in the United States, Wrestle Kingdom 17 took place in the wee hours of the morning on Wednesday from the legendary Tokyo Dome.
This makes WK17 one of the biggest crossover events ever, but the focus was still on the NJPW stars and championships.
Not only did her arrival create a massive reaction on social media, but she immediately set herself up to be the next challenger for KAIRI's IWGP Women's World Championship.
Japanese wrestling fans are not as raucous as American fans, so a lot of new viewers might have thought she didn't get much of a reaction.
For a lot of fans, this might be their first NJPW show.
