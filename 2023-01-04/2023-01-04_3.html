    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Republicans fighting the selection of former Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy have offered U.S. Rep.-elect Byron Donalds as an alternative choice.
U.S. Rep.-elect Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, nominated Donalds for Speaker ahead of the fourth vote in two days for the post.
The Naples Republican received 20 votes in the fourth ballot for Speaker, and the same amount on a fifth vote.
On a fifth vote, Donalds was nominated once again, but by Rep.-elect Lauren Boebert.
He served at the time as a member of the Florida House, where he was elected to two terms.

     Kean Listens Intently as Roy Changes Course with Donalds and McCarthy Fails Again
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, Republican of Texas this afternoon put the name of fellow Republican, U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, into nomination for the speakership of the U.S. House of Representatives.
“They want a new face, vision and leadership and I believe that new face, vision and leadership is Byron Donalds,” said Roy, who had previously backed U.S. Rep. Jim Jordans for speaker.
Jordan backed embattled U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Ca.)
So now the rightward segment of the House Republican caucus appeared on course to back another Donald J. Trump-backed candidate Donalds – not Jordan – as an alternative to McCarthy.
U.S. Rep.-elect Tom Kean, Jr. and U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, both Republican backers of McCarthy, sat behind Roy and listened as the Texan continued to put another name in contention.

     Summary: For the first time, two Black people were nominated to be speaker of the House of Representatives.
Conservatives opposed to Kevin McCarthy nominated Rep. Byron Donalds on the 4th ballot on Wednesday.
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stepped down from leadership at the end of the last Congress, though she will remain in the House as a rank-and-file lawmaker.
"Now, here we are, and for the first time in history, there have been two Black Americans placed into the nomination for speaker of the House."
Donalds' nomination came on the fourth ballot for House speaker.
