     Salesforce to cut workforce by 10% after hiring ‘too many people’ during the pandemic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Similar to other companies hit by significant layoffs over the past year, Benioff added that Salesforce had hired too many people through the pandemic during the boom times.
For context, the company claimed 79,000 employees last February, a 30% increase on 2020.
Certainly, Salesforce revealed an initial round of layoffs in early November affecting “hundreds” of workers, with co-CEO and co-chair Bret Taylor announcing shortly after that he would be stepping down.
The company also refused to provide a revenue forecast for 2023 at it most recent earnings report last year.
Salesforce said that the restructuring effort will cost it between $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion, which it expects to incur in Q4 of fiscal 2023.

     Salesforce to cut staff by 10% in latest tech layoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Salesforce said on Wednesday it would lay off about 10% of its employees and close some offices, becoming the latest tech firm to undertake cost cuts amid an economic slowdown.
"As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we're now facing, and I take responsibility for that," Benioff said.
Salesforce growth has slowed during the past four quarters, with the company posting its weakest revenue increase for the three months ended Oct. 31, as a strong dollar also eats into its sales.
Salesforce had 73,541 employees at the end of January last year.
Shares of Salesforce rose 3% before the bell, after losing nearly half of their value in 2022.

     Salesforce laying off 10 percent of workforce in restructuring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The business software giant Salesforce is set to lay off 10 percent of its workforce, nearly 8,000 employees, and cut back its office spaces, according to a letter to employees on Wednesday citing concerns about the direction of the economy.
The decision by Salesforce is the latest in a string of moves by tech companies to turn to layoffs amid fears of inflation and a looming recession.
In November, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced it would lay off 11,000 employees.
Like other tech companies, Salesforce’s revenue surged throughout the pandemic as people turned to work-from-home policies and relied heavily on technology to stay connected.
Benioff said the company hired “too many people” as its revenue grew, leading to the need for workforce cuts.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Salesforce said Wednesday that it will cut approximately 10% of its workforce and reduce its real estate footprint, making it the latest tech company to slash expenses as broader economic uncertainty continues to hit Silicon Valley particularly hard.
“I’ve been thinking a lot about how we came to this moment,” Benioff wrote.
Also on Wednesday, video-sharing platform Vimeo said in a regulatory filing that it would cut approximately 11% of its workforce.
Like Benioff, a number of other tech founders and CEOs have since admitted they failed to accurately gauge pandemic demand.
And most of all, please lean on your leadership, including me, as we work through this difficult time together.”
