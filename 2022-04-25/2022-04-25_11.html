     We Own This City review: A shocking police corruption tale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Their latest miniseries, We Own This City, based on the book of the same name by Baltimore Sun reporter Justin Fenton, chronicles the real-life story of the Baltimore Police Department's Gun Trace Task Force (GTTF), an elite unit that ruled the city like a roving gang of thieves.
They wrongfully searched civilians and stole money from them, planted drugs and guns, and generally acted with brutal impunity, all with the protection of a badge.
In 2017, all eight members of the GTTF were arrested on charges of federal racketeering and all were eventually sentenced to multiple years in prison.
His devolution into an aggressive thug serves as the series' backbone, but per their wont, Simon and Pelecanos branch out laterally across multiple different fields.
An escalating problemWe Own This City sports an intriguing non-linear structure that initially seems haphazard but quickly reveals itself to be thematically compelling.

     Summary: The limited series, 'We Own This City,' is about to debut on HBOIt begins Monday and dramatizes the book of the same name which chronicles abuses by Baltimore's police department.
LEILA FADEL, HOST:HBO's limited series "We Own This City" debuts tonight.
NPR TV critic Eric Deggans talked about the project with two executive producers who first teamed up on another landmark HBO series about policing in Baltimore.
And if you're getting good cases, if you're getting drugs and guns, you're bringing in shooters, then you can't lose.
DEGGANS: Much of this was foreshadowed in the series Simon and Pelecanos worked on in the mid-2000s, "The Wire."

     Summary: The Wire presents a far more comprehensive and all-encompassing look at hope and corruption in the Charm City.
We Own This City, on the other hand, outlines a kind of corruption so ingrained The Wire would’ve struggled to capture it accurately.
City doesn’t hesitate to show this side of Baltimore’s police, especially the Gun Tracing Task Force, in unblinking commitment.
We Own This City doesn’t present his rise to power and simultaneous total corruption as tragic, per se.
However, the series doesn’t try to make you sympathetic to him.

     HBO’s We Own This City can’t solve the problem of policing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wayne Jenkins (Jon Bernthal) smirks to a room of cadets in creators David Simon and George Pelecanos’ HBO crime series We Own This City.
We Own This City is a ruminative show with a multitude of moving parts — too many, in fact.
In a narrative concerned with men and the rampant machismo of BPD, Steele is one of the few female characters.
At every level, We Own This City has zero interest in building out women, or quite frankly, anything that’s not a case.
The narrative displays the vices — greed, sex, and drugs — that marked all levels of BPD, especially the Gun Force Task Squad.

     Summary: Jamie Hector (right) as detective Sean M. Suiter in 'We Own This City.'
“I fought this war,” Treat Williams, playing a retired detective, tells Steele regarding the drug war.
And I did nothing but lose in my time.”“We Own This City” doesn’t reach the level that “The Wire” did.
Yet in terms of bringing a sharp dramatic eye to big-city policing, Simon and company pretty much own this genre.

     The True Story Behind 'We Own This City'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We Own This City, an HBO Max miniseries out April 25, about a Baltimore Police Department (BPD) task force unit that went rogue, highlights some of the biggest concerns with modern policing in America.
Adapted from former Baltimore Sun reporter Justin Fenton’s 2021 book We Own This City: A True Story of Crime, Cops, and Corruption, the show chronicles the rise and fall of one of the most shocking instances of police corruption in Baltimore’s history.
How the GTTF terrorized the city of BaltimoreThe wide array of crimes the GTTF’s officers engaged in is staggering.
When they found out that the couple had $40,000 in a house outside the city, they went to the house and took $20,000.
Some GTTF officers admitted in court that they would drive fast toward groups of people in the street and slam on the breaks.

     HBO's We Own This City Is the Next Generation of The Wire Fans Have Been Waiting For
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of course, when you hear the words “law enforcement” and “Baltimore” together, the TV show The Wire quickly springs to mind—and for good reason.
The settings, cinematography, music, and rapid-fire dialogue in We Own This City are all reminiscent of The Wire.
He used to work with Jenkins, but has found a new purpose in his work as a homicide detective.
But although We Own This City is addictive and sure to be devoured by fans of The Wire, it does suffer from two nagging issues.
Provocative, powerful, and with first-rate performances, We Own This City is the next generation of The Wire fans have long craved.
