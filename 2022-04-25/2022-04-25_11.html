     Summary: In 2018 DaBaby shot and killed Jaylin Craig in the parking lot of a Walmart in Charlotte, NC.
ADVERTISEMENTIn the video DaBaby, real name Jonathan Kirk, is seen running at Craig and and his friend Henry Douglas, tackling Craig before striking him.
DaBaby shot and killed 19-year-old Jaylin Craig in 2018, a shooting the rapper claims was in self-defense.

     Previously Unreleased Video Casts Doubt On DaBaby's Self-Defense Claim In 2018 Walmart Murder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charlotte, NC – DaBaby was on the verge of superstardom when he was cleared in the November 2018 murder of Jaylin Craig.
The KIRK rapper claimed he shot the 19-year-old North Carolina native in self-defense after a chance encounter at a Charlotte-area Walmart.
But in newly obtained video by Rolling Stone, DaBaby’s self-defense claim appears to be called into question.
Craig thought he saw DaBaby in the store but was thrown off by his subdued clothing and the fact he was shopping for baby clothes in a Walmart.
While Douglas says he never saw Craig draw a weapon, DaBaby told police they saw Craig pull a gun out he was fighting with Douglas.
