     Cincinnati Bengals 7-round 2022 NFL mock draft: Final edition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We’ve made it to draft week after what feels like forever since this whole process started.
Let’s run through one more seven-round mock Cincinnati Bengals before we finally get to the actual draft, using The Draft Network’s simulator.
Those Bengals enter the draft with notable needs at one offensive line position, as well as defensive spots like cornerback, defensive tackle and in terms of pressure-creators.
A final seven-round mock will try to marry those needs with value and with prospects that fit the profile the Bengals like to take.
The goal is to provide a good idea of what might unfold this week during the three-day affair.

     Summary: As we enter the week of the NFL Draft, we bring you our final Mock Draft ahead of the 2022 NFL Draft, this time a full seven-round mock draft, Dawg version.
For the third consecutive year, the University of Georgia will be shattering its own NFL Draft record.
After having sent 7 players to the NFL in 2020 and 8 players to the draft in 2021, Georgia could have as many as 14 players drafted in this week's 2022 NFL Draft.
1 Jacksonville Jaguars - DE, Travon WalkerThere's a theory running around the league that if Aidan Hutchinson were truly the No.
Rodgers is locked up for several more years in Green Bay, and he likely will need wide receiver help quickly.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is the first draft in recent memory where there isn’t a consensus number one overall prospect.
There are still guys rising and falling as each day passes.
In my first and only mock, I’ve looked at the value that each player adds to the team making the pick.
There are only a few teams that are in a rebuild, this means that teams may not go with best available, but rather guys that help them win now.
That being said, there won’t be any trades in this mock draft.

     Rhett Lewis 2022 NFL mock draft 1.0: Pass rushers fly off the board; Jets grab a wide receiver at No. 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The presence of a capable starter in Jared Goff makes a QB selection here even more likely, at least in my eyes.
Goff can be the bridge that allows a developmental process for a young QB.
Plus, you get the extra season of cost control with the fifth-year option.
Howell feels like Dan Campbell's kind of quarterback.
It was easy to see his toughness when you watched him pinball off would-be tacklers in the run game this past season, especially against Miami.

     2022 NFL mock draft roundup 13.0: Jordan Davis is popular pick for Eagles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trade down: Devin Lloyd, LB, UtahWhat they said: “Projected Trade: Eagles trade the 18th pick to the Packers for the 22nd pick and a late third-round pick, 92nd overall.
There seems to be a good shot he won’t be available when the Eagles are on the clock, but if he is, the Eagles really should be interested.
The Johnson pick wouldn’t be a very popular pick.
When mock draft season really got underway, some of the offensive linemen were being mocked to the Eagles because of Brandon Brooks’ retirement.
Yeah, this is probably pretty early for the Eagles to draft a tight end but it’s an underrated position of need.
