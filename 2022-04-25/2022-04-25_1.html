     Here’s What’s Next for Elon Musk and Twitter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk struck an agreement on Monday to buy Twitter for roughly $44 billion, setting up the biggest deal to take a company private in at least two decades.
Political leaders have made it a megaphone, while companies, celebrities and others have used it to hone images and make money.
Mr. Musk’s takeover attracted concern about the world’s richest person having control of an influential communication platform.
A director at a women’s rights organization called it “a massively slippery slope.”Twitter’s board has already unanimously approved the deal.
Here’s what’s next for Twitter:

     Twitter workers face a reality they’ve long feared: Elon Musk as owner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Choose your plan ArrowRight On Twitter, in private messages and in interviews with The Washington Post, employees expressed fear about Musk’s $44 billion takeover.
“Elon did not tie up 20 percent of his net worth to destroy Twitter,” a Twitter employee told The Post, noting that the company was behind its peers on many fronts.
To many observers and employees, Musk’s acquisition bid looked unlikely at first.
In the town hall, Twitter executives and board chair Taylor acknowledged emotions were running high for people.
The concern has precedent: Years ago, a Twitter employee temporarily took down Trump’s account.

     Elon Musk buys Twitter for $44B and will privatize company
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The outspoken Tesla CEO has said he wanted to own and privatize Twitter because he thinks it’s not living up to its potential as a platform for free speech.
Musk has described himself as a “free-speech absolutist” but also is known for blocking or disparaging other Twitter users who question or disagree with him.
Musk believes he can increase revenue through subscriptions that give paying customers a better experience, perhaps even an ad-free version of Twitter.
Asked during a recent TED talk if there are any limits to his notion of “free speech,” Musk said Twitter or any forum is “obviously bound by the laws of the country that it operates in.
Forrester Research director Mike Proulx said that if Musk decides to loosen content moderation policies, he puts Twitter ad dollars at risk.
