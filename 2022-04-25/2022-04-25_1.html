    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Twitter’s 11 board members have accepted Elon Musk’s roughly $44 billion takeover bid, the company announced on Monday afternoon.
“The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon’s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing,” said Twitter’s independent board chairman Bret Taylor in a Monday announcement.

Musk also privately met with a number of Twitter shareholders on Friday to make the case for his offer and ownership plan.
“I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” Musk wrote in his Twitter offer letter.
