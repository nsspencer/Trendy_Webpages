     Why did Elon Musk buy Twitter?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter, once thought of as a long shot, has now been accepted .
The billionaire will pay about $44 billion for the company in a deal expected to close this year, Twitter said in a news release Monday.
Musk was so motivated to buy Twitter that he put in a “best and final offer” for the company, announced he had a Plan B if that failed and met privately with several large Twitter shareholders to convince them about his bid.

     Twitter Employees Search for Answers as Musk Takeover Becomes Reality
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In January 2020, thousands of Twitter employees gathered in Houston for a corporate summit called #OneTeam.
Inside Twitter today, surprise announcements about Mr. Musk land differently.
As the takeover fight played out over the last two weeks, Twitter employees said they were frustrated that they had heard little from management about what it meant for them, even as Twitter closed in on a deal with Mr. Musk on Monday morning.
They asked Mr. Musk himself in questions sent on Twitter.
On Monday afternoon, Mr. Agrawal told employees he would finally speak with them at a meeting later that day.

     Summary: Elon Musk has reached a $44bn deal to buy Twitter in a takeover that will give the world’s richest man control of a social network with more than 200 million users.
“Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,” Twitter’s chief executive, Parag Agrawal, said in a tweet confirming the sale.
The Musk takeover has been unexpected and controversial amongst Twitter employees.
“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he tweeted on Monday.
American free speech law is essentially just the first amendment, which only constrains government actors, not a company like Twitter or a person like Elon Musk,” she said.

     Elon Musk buys Twitter for $44B and will privatize company
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The outspoken Tesla CEO has said he wanted to own and privatize Twitter because he thinks it’s not living up to its potential as a platform for free speech.
On April 14, Musk announced an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share.
Musk has described himself as a “free-speech absolutist” but is also known for blocking or disparaging other Twitter users who question or disagree with him.
Asked during a recent TED talk if there are any limits to his notion of “free speech,” Musk said Twitter or any forum is “obviously bound by the laws of the country that it operates in.
Forrester Research director Mike Proulx said that if Musk decides to loosen content moderation policies, he puts Twitter ad dollars at risk.
