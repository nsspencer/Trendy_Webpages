     NBA World Reacts To Grayson Allen’s Performance Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Milwaukee Bucks have been dominating the Chicago Bulls in the first half of Game 4 today.
But the surprise hero of the game thus far has been Grayson Allen.
— Eric Nehm (@eric_nehm) April 24, 2022It’s been a long and winding road for Grayson Allen in his NBA career to say the least.
He’s gotten more minutes and starts than ever before and rewarded the reigning NBA champions with career-highs in nearly all categories.
Will the 2022 NBA playoffs be the coming out party for Grayson Allen as a bonafide star shooting guard?

     Grayson Allen’s honest take might make Bulls fans hate him even more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Many are still absolutely angry at him after he injured Chicago Bulls guard Alex Caruso last January.
But it has become clear that the Milwaukee Bucks guard isn’t fazed at all.
He was heavily booed by the fans of the Bulls throughout the game, but he has learned to tune them out.
The Bucks jeer Allen as well during practices and film sessions or when they’re on the bus or in a hotel.
Allen knows he’s considered a villain in the NBA, and he fires back by helping the Bucks win.

by Candice EvansThe Chicago Bulls arch nemesis Grayson Allen shot the team down in Game 3 of their first round series against the Milwaukee Bucks.
That streak has continued into Game 4, as Allen leads the Bucks in scoring at halftime— despite heavy antagonizing from the Chicago crowd.
Grayson Allen is getting heavy boos, but he continues to deliver in Chicago in this series.
After the play, Allen was seen laughing on the sideline prior to being ejected.

Which probably drowned out a real “(Bleep) you, Grayson Allen” from a fan behind the Bucks basket at the end of the game.
“I think that’s his comfort zone, I think that’s what he’s used to, right?” said Bucks center Brook Lopez of the Bucks boos.
The ultimate joy out there for me is just playing, have fun, play free.
I’m not going out searching for it, like, oh I love this…”And yet where would the Bucks be right now without Allen?

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grayson Allen stays hot with 27 points and six 3-pointers in the Bucks' Game 4 victory over the Bulls.
(1:10)CHICAGO -- In the days leading up to the team's first road playoff games in Chicago, the Milwaukee Bucks used every opportunity they could to shower Grayson Allen with boos.
So when Allen set back-to-back playoff career highs in Games 3 and 4 this weekend to help Milwaukee take a commanding 3-1 series lead over Chicago, the Bucks bench enjoyed booing him all the way.
Even if he has gained a reputation as a villain in Chicago, Allen insisted after the game Sunday that he does not feed off such a negative reaction.
After leading all scorers in Game 3 on Friday with 22 points, Allen was even better on Sunday afternoon.

     Bulls vs. Bucks score, takeaways: Grayson Allen embraces the boos as Milwaukee opens up 3-1 series lead

     Summary: The win puts the Bucks up 3-1 in the series, with the opportunity to close things out on Wednesday at home.
Here's three takeaways from Game 4 between the Bucks and the Bulls.
Grayson Allen's encoreAfter dropping 22 points in Game 3, Allen once again torched the Bulls to the tune of a 27-point performance.
Though Allen says he doesn't feed off the boos, it's been working for him and the Bucks, so Milwaukee might as well keep it up.
Even in Chicago's Game 2 win in Milwaukee, it took DeRozan going off for 41 points to carry the Bulls to a win.
