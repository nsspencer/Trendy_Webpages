     Supreme Court Leans Toward Coach in Case on School Prayer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court’s conservative majority seemed to be searching on Monday for a narrow way to rule in favor of a former high school football coach who lost his job for praying at the 50-yard line after his team’s games.
The task was complicated by factual disputes over the conduct of the coach, Joseph A. Kennedy, and the varying rationales offered by the school district in Bremerton, Wash., for disciplining him.
The case pits the rights of government workers to free speech and the free exercise of their faith against the Constitution’s prohibition of government endorsement of religion and Supreme Court precedents that forbid pressuring students to participate in religious activities.
In his eight years as an assistant coach at Bremerton High School, Mr. Kennedy routinely offered prayers after games, with students often joining him.
He also led and participated in prayers in the locker room, a practice neither he nor his lawyers now defends.

     U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments in former high school football coach's school prayer case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When public school officials in Bremerton, Washington, asked Kennedy to stop praying publicly, he refused.
Kennedy sued, and with the support of conservative activists, his case wound its way to the Supreme Court.
The court's three more liberal members compared Kennedy's prayers to the hypothetical prayers of other school officials, which would not be permitted.
Members of the court's six-member conservative majority, meanwhile, asked questions comparing Kennedy's prayers to other, non-religious actions.
In recent decisions, the Supreme Court has tended to support religious liberty, and a victory for Kennedy could loosen restrictions on religious expression in public schools.

     U.S. Supreme Court conservatives lean toward football coach in prayer case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At issue is whether, as a public employee, Kennedy's actions amounted to governmental speech, which can be regulated under Supreme Court precedents, or a private act separate from his official duties, which the First Amendment would protect.
The school district notified Kennedy to stop the prayers while on duty, offering other private locations in the school as alternatives.
Even if it is clear a teacher is not speaking on behalf of the school district, coercion could be present, Kagan added.
Kennedy served as a coach at his alma mater, Bremerton High School, from 2008 to 2015.
Kennedy sought a court order to be reinstated as a coach, accusing officials of religious discrimination and violating his free speech rights.

     Summary: Supreme Court seems sympathetic to coach who claims right to pray on the 50-yard-lineThe U.S. Supreme Court is hearing the case of Joe Kennedy, a former assistant high school football coach who was suspended after praying on the field.
The case centered on a football coach who claims he has the right to pray on the 50-yard line after each game, joined by those of his players who want to participate.
TOTENBERG: Justice Kagan said that whatever label you put on coach Kennedy's prayers is irrelevant.
But even in this case, conservative Justice Kavanaugh, an avid sports fan and parent coach, understood how coach Kennedy's behavior might be perceived by some parents.
Coach Kennedy's lawyer replied to that suggestion with alarm.

     Supreme Court likely to rule for high school coach forced out for praying on the field
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Supreme Court on Monday seemed inclined to rule for a Washington state high school football coach who lost his job after he refused to stop praying on the field immediately after games.
During nearly two hours of courtroom argument, the conservative majority seemed prepared to rule that the coach was expressing his own private religious views and was not speaking for the school district.
“The government doesn’t endorse all private speech just because it takes place on school grounds,” Kennedy's lawyer, Paul Clement, told the court.
“No one in America should have to hide who they are or that they have faith.”The school district said his prayer was anything but private.
The case attracted an unusual amount of attention, with 60 friend-of-court briefs, including from former professional football players — some supporting the coach, others supporting the school district.

     Supreme Court appears sympathetic to high school football coach ousted after midfield prayers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Supreme Court's conservative majority appeared to agree that the prayers were private.
Members of the court's conservative wing pressed the lawyer for the school district with hypotheticals indicating skepticism of the government-speech argument.
Interview:Praying coach who lost job said he made 'commitment to God'Earlier:Supreme Court to hear case of high school football coach ousted for prayer"It's not audible to all players," said Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Kavanaugh and other conservative justices shot down the idea Monday that the so-called endorsement test should apply in Kennedy's case.
Kennedy's case made it to the Supreme Court once before, in 2019, as he sought to reclaim his job while the case continued.

     Summary: AdvertisementSuppose “when Coach Kennedy went out to the center of the field … all he did was to wave a Ukrainian flag.
Katskee said the school district could discipline a coach for such actions because it “doesn’t want its event taken over for political speech.”“Where is the school district rule that says that?” Alito demanded.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit sided with the school district.

“He’s the one who’s going to give me an A or not.”Katskee said that was what the school district was trying to avoid.
