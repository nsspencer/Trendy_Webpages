     Summary: Police release a trove of videos in the probe of the Alec Baldwin film-set shootingEnlarge this image toggle caption Jae C. Hong/AP Jae C. Hong/APSANTA FE, N.M. — Law enforcement officials released a trove of video evidence Monday in the ongoing investigation of a fatal October shooting of a cinematographer by actor and producer Alec Baldwin on the set of a Western movie.
A search for the gun leads to the movie production's armorer, who breaks down in tears.
Baldwin said the gun should have been empty for a rehearsal with no filming.
In the Oct. 21 video, Baldwin repeatedly says there were no prior problems of any kind with firearms on the set of Rust.
The bureau also documented gun safety complaints from crew members that went unheeded and said weapons specialists were not allowed to make decisions about additional safety training.

     Alec Baldwin's revelations to police hurt his case: experts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Police have released footage of an interview conducted with actor Alec Baldwin from October 2021.
“It’s not a good look for him.”During the approximately hour-long interview, Baldwin, 63, insisted that he was told that the Colt .45 he was handed was safe to use.
Things got strange when Baldwin told detectives about his wife’s response when he suggested having a gun in the house.
The OHSB report found that Rust Movie Productions had “willfully violated” a number of safety procedures and showed “plain indifference” to the well-being of employees and crew.
Whether or not Baldwin’s statements to police hurt him criminally, Ritter said they won’t help him with pending civil litigation.
