     What really happened? | Recent Rolling Stone report casts doubt in DaBaby's 2018 self-defense killing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But now, Rolling Stone obtained newly released security footage that seems to show a different story from what was originally reported in 2018.
In the new video posted by Rolling Stone on April 24, DaBaby is seen throwing the first physical punch at Craig's friend, Henry Douglas.
The family told Rolling Stone DaBaby failed to mention how the physical fight started and never told authorities he was the one who threw the first punch.
Craig's mother LaWanda Horsely told Rolling Stone, “[Kirk] knows what he did.
“I don’t look at him as no DaBaby,” Horsley said to Rolling Stone.
