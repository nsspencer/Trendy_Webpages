     Summary: Jurors listen to tense audio recordings at Johnny Depp's libel trialEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Lo Scalzo/AP Jim Lo Scalzo/APEditor's note: This story contains profanity.
FAIRFAX, Va. — Jurors in Johnny Depp's libel lawsuit against his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, on Monday heard audio recordings in which he referred to the violence that could ensue if their arguments were allowed to escalate.
In other audio clips, Depp loudly shouts vulgarities at his wife, calling her a degrading name and yelling, "You stupid f—-" at her.
Depp is suing Heard for libel over a 2018 op-ed piece she wrote in The Washington Post.
Most of the questioning consisted of Ben Rottenborn, Heard's lawyer, playing audio clips or reading vulgar text messages sent by Depp and asking Depp if he'd read them correctly.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadBy the time the alpacas arrive outside the Fairfax County Courthouse, it’s not really that surprising.
“I thought the alpacas might brighten his day,” Diaz says last Monday, not long before Depp first takes the stand.
Attorneys for Amber Heard questioned Johnny Depp on April 21 in the defamation trial between the formerly married actors, presenting vulgar texts sent by Depp.
Depp and Heard appear in the courtroom every day, not making eye contact and occasionally leaning over to speak to their attorneys.
He tells them it’s for the Johnny Depp trial, and they think he’s kidding.
