     Summary: Jurors listen to tense audio recordings at Johnny Depp's libel trialEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Lo Scalzo/AP Jim Lo Scalzo/APEditor's note: This story contains profanity.
FAIRFAX, Va. — Jurors in Johnny Depp's libel lawsuit against his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, on Monday heard audio recordings in which he referred to the violence that could ensue if their arguments were allowed to escalate.
In other audio clips, Depp loudly shouts vulgarities at his wife, calling her a degrading name and yelling, "You stupid f—-" at her.
Depp is suing Heard for libel over a 2018 op-ed piece she wrote in The Washington Post.
Most of the questioning consisted of Ben Rottenborn, Heard's lawyer, playing audio clips or reading vulgar text messages sent by Depp and asking Depp if he'd read them correctly.

     Summary: In a text message to a Dr. Kipper, Depp wrote "I cut the top of my middle finger off."
In the text exchange, Depp said he wrote that he cut his left finger off to remind him not to cut his right finger off.
He said learning to play guitar at the age of 12 was a way to "escape into music."
He also said he was thankful the injury was not on his left hand.
If he had lost a finger from his left hand, Depp said he would have had to relearn how to play the guitar all over again.

(Photo by Tristan Fewings/Getty Images) Getty ImagesJohnny Depp’s defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard has taken a surreal turn, as makeup brand Milani took to TikTok to turn footage of the trial into content, an advertisement masquerading as an “epic clapback” that has been viewed at least 4.6 million times.
In the TikTok clip, Milani pushes back against a claim made by one of Amber Heard's lawyers, that Heard used one of the company's concealers to cover up bruises during her abusive marriage to Johnny Depp.
Footage of the trial has been live-streaming on various platforms since April 11, like a star-studded episode of Judge Judy, with multiple celebrities dragged into the mess.
Nothing, it seems, is off-limits; everything is content, and content can be used to push merchandise, even if said merchandise is associated with a domestic abuse case.
