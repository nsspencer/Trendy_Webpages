    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is the first draft in recent memory where there isn’t a consensus number one overall prospect.
There are still guys rising and falling as each day passes.
In my first and only mock, I’ve looked at the value that each player adds to the team making the pick.
There are only a few teams that are in a rebuild, this means that teams may not go with best available, but rather guys that help them win now.
That being said, there won’t be any trades in this mock draft.

     Eagles, NFL mock draft roundup: What the experts are saying
    </h2>

     Summary: Here are a few theories as we near the NFL Draft and final decisions on what the Eagles decide to do.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The presence of a capable starter in Jared Goff makes a QB selection here even more likely, at least in my eyes.
Goff can be the bridge that allows a developmental process for a young QB.
Plus, you get the extra season of cost control with the fifth-year option.
Howell feels like Dan Campbell's kind of quarterback.
It was easy to see his toughness when you watched him pinball off would-be tacklers in the run game this past season, especially against Miami.

     2022 NFL Mock Draft: How it SHOULD Go
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One thing that's a constant every year, and should hold true again in 2022, is NFL teams will reach for quarterbacks.
With the 1st pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, the Jacksonville Jaguars select:Jacksonville - Evan Neal, OL, AlabamaTrevor Lawrence had a nightmare rookie season.
Another 1% is a lack of weapons and the last 1% is a terrible offensive line.
New York Giants - Ahmad Gardner, CB, CincinnatiYes, they need offensive line help.
Christian McCaffrey is expected to be healthy again in 2022 and keeping him that way should be priority #1 until they sort out the QB position.
