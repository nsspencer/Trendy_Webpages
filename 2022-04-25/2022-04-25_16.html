    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is the first draft in recent memory where there isn’t a consensus number one overall prospect.
There are still guys rising and falling as each day passes.
In my first and only mock, I’ve looked at the value that each player adds to the team making the pick.
There are only a few teams that are in a rebuild, this means that teams may not go with best available, but rather guys that help them win now.
That being said, there won’t be any trades in this mock draft.

     Summary: As we enter the week of the NFL Draft, we bring you our final Mock Draft ahead of the 2022 NFL Draft, this time a full seven-round mock draft, Dawg version.
For the third consecutive year, the University of Georgia will be shattering its own NFL Draft record.
After having sent 7 players to the NFL in 2020 and 8 players to the draft in 2021, Georgia could have as many as 14 players drafted in this week's 2022 NFL Draft.
1 Jacksonville Jaguars - DE, Travon WalkerThere's a theory running around the league that if Aidan Hutchinson were truly the No.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The presence of a capable starter in Jared Goff makes a QB selection here even more likely, at least in my eyes.
Goff can be the bridge that allows a developmental process for a young QB.
Plus, you get the extra season of cost control with the fifth-year option.
Howell feels like Dan Campbell's kind of quarterback.
It was easy to see his toughness when you watched him pinball off would-be tacklers in the run game this past season, especially against Miami.
