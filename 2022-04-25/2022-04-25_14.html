     We Own This City review: A shocking police corruption tale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Their latest miniseries, We Own This City, based on the book of the same name by Baltimore Sun reporter Justin Fenton, chronicles the real-life story of the Baltimore Police Department's Gun Trace Task Force (GTTF), an elite unit that ruled the city like a roving gang of thieves.
They wrongfully searched civilians and stole money from them, planted drugs and guns, and generally acted with brutal impunity, all with the protection of a badge.
In 2017, all eight members of the GTTF were arrested on charges of federal racketeering and all were eventually sentenced to multiple years in prison.
His devolution into an aggressive thug serves as the series' backbone, but per their wont, Simon and Pelecanos branch out laterally across multiple different fields.
An escalating problemWe Own This City sports an intriguing non-linear structure that initially seems haphazard but quickly reveals itself to be thematically compelling.

     'The Wire' merges with Baltimore policing's reality in 'We Own This City'

's Civil Rights division investigating police corruption, working against a deadline knowing the Trump administration might not follow through on her efforts.
Other key figures include Jon Bernthal ("The Punisher") as Sgt.
Wayne Jenkins, a rogue officer whose exploits are documented through those aforementioned flashbacks; and Jamie Hector ("The Wire") as Sean M. Suiter, a detective who begins to face uncomfortable questions regarding his past.
As with "The Wire," "We Own This City" provides a granular look at the bureaucratic dysfunction that allowed certain cops to operate so brazenly, including the leverage wielded by officers over department and city officials concerned about their own careers and election prospects.

     Summary: The limited series, 'We Own This City,' is about to debut on HBOIt begins Monday and dramatizes the book of the same name which chronicles abuses by Baltimore's police department.
LEILA FADEL, HOST:HBO's limited series "We Own This City" debuts tonight.
NPR TV critic Eric Deggans talked about the project with two executive producers who first teamed up on another landmark HBO series about policing in Baltimore.
And if you're getting good cases, if you're getting drugs and guns, you're bringing in shooters, then you can't lose.
DEGGANS: Much of this was foreshadowed in the series Simon and Pelecanos worked on in the mid-2000s, "The Wire."

     Summary: The Wire presents a far more comprehensive and all-encompassing look at hope and corruption in the Charm City.
We Own This City, on the other hand, outlines a kind of corruption so ingrained The Wire would’ve struggled to capture it accurately.
City doesn’t hesitate to show this side of Baltimore’s police, especially the Gun Tracing Task Force, in unblinking commitment.
We Own This City doesn’t present his rise to power and simultaneous total corruption as tragic, per se.
However, the series doesn’t try to make you sympathetic to him.

     Summary: Of course, when you hear the words “law enforcement” and “Baltimore” together, the TV show The Wire quickly springs to mind—and for good reason.
The settings, cinematography, music, and rapid-fire dialogue in We Own This City are all reminiscent of The Wire.
He used to work with Jenkins, but has found a new purpose in his work as a homicide detective.
But although We Own This City is addictive and sure to be devoured by fans of The Wire, it does suffer from two nagging issues.
Provocative, powerful, and with first-rate performances, We Own This City is the next generation of The Wire fans have long craved.

     HBO’s We Own This City can’t solve the problem of policing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wayne Jenkins (Jon Bernthal) smirks to a room of cadets in creators David Simon and George Pelecanos’ HBO crime series We Own This City.
We Own This City is a ruminative show with a multitude of moving parts — too many, in fact.
In a narrative concerned with men and the rampant machismo of BPD, Steele is one of the few female characters.
At every level, We Own This City has zero interest in building out women, or quite frankly, anything that’s not a case.
The narrative displays the vices — greed, sex, and drugs — that marked all levels of BPD, especially the Gun Force Task Squad.
