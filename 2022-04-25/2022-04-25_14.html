     Supreme Court Leans Toward Coach in Case on School Prayer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court’s conservative majority seemed to be searching on Monday for a narrow way to rule in favor of a former high school football coach who lost his job for praying at the 50-yard line after his team’s games.
The task was complicated by factual disputes over the conduct of the coach, Joseph A. Kennedy, and the varying rationales offered by the school district in Bremerton, Wash., for disciplining him.
The case pits the rights of government workers to free speech and the free exercise of their faith against the Constitution’s prohibition of government endorsement of religion and Supreme Court precedents that forbid pressuring students to participate in religious activities.
In his eight years as an assistant coach at Bremerton High School, Mr. Kennedy routinely offered prayers after games, with students often joining him.
He also led and participated in prayers in the locker room, a practice neither he nor his lawyers now defends.

     U.S. Supreme Court conservatives lean toward football coach in prayer case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At issue is whether, as a public employee, Kennedy's actions amounted to governmental speech, which can be regulated under Supreme Court precedents, or a private act separate from his official duties, which the First Amendment would protect.
The school district notified Kennedy to stop the prayers while on duty, offering other private locations in the school as alternatives.
Even if it is clear a teacher is not speaking on behalf of the school district, coercion could be present, Kagan added.
Kennedy served as a coach at his alma mater, Bremerton High School, from 2008 to 2015.
Kennedy sought a court order to be reinstated as a coach, accusing officials of religious discrimination and violating his free speech rights.

     Supreme Court likely to rule for high school coach forced out for praying on the field
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Supreme Court on Monday seemed inclined to rule for a Washington state high school football coach who lost his job after he refused to stop praying on the field immediately after games.
During nearly two hours of courtroom argument, the conservative majority seemed prepared to rule that the coach was expressing his own private religious views and was not speaking for the school district.
“The government doesn’t endorse all private speech just because it takes place on school grounds,” Kennedy's lawyer, Paul Clement, told the court.
“No one in America should have to hide who they are or that they have faith.”The school district said his prayer was anything but private.
The case attracted an unusual amount of attention, with 60 friend-of-court briefs, including from former professional football players — some supporting the coach, others supporting the school district.

     Supreme Court Tackles Case About Praying Football Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Supreme Court justices discussed all those hypothetical scenarios Monday while hearing arguments about a former public high school football coach from Washington state who wanted to kneel and pray on the field after games.
Yes, a lawyer for the school district said, because the district “doesn't want its event taken over for political speech.”The Supreme Court previously declined to get involved in the case at an earlier stage in 2019.
The case before the justices on Monday involves Joseph Kennedy, a Christian and former football coach at Bremerton High School in Bremerton, Washington.
The school district learned what he was doing in 2015 and asked him to stop.
The case is Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, 21-418.

Katskee said the school district could discipline a coach for such actions because it “doesn’t want its event taken over for political speech.”“Where is the school district rule that says that?” Alito demanded.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit sided with the school district.
Advertisement“That seems to me to be coercive of 16-year-olds regardless if they know that it’s him and not the school district,” she said.
“He’s the one who’s going to give me an A or not.”Katskee said that was what the school district was trying to avoid.

     How an unknown high school football coach landed in the center of a Supreme Court religious liberty case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Many legal observers say it is likely that the Supreme Court will rule in Kennedy's favor, given its recent deference to religious liberty.
But the case's larger impact will turn on whether the justices view Kennedy's prayers as private expressions of thanks or public spectacles.
It compared Kennedy's prayers to on-field political protests inspired by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.
"Coach Kennedy used his power as a school official to coerce students in public at a public high school to pray.
Through the years, the high court has ruled against teacher-led prayer and Bible readings in public school classrooms, religious invocations at graduations, and student-led prayers at public school football games.
