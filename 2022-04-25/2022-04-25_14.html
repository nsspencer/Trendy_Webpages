     New York judge holds Donald Trump in contempt for failing to comply with subpoena for business documents
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A New York judge held former President Donald Trump in contempt of court Monday for failing to comply with a subpoena for business documents related to a civil investigation by the state attorney general's office of his company.
Trump will have to pay $10,000 per day for as long as he fails to comply with the subpoena.
The contempt finding by Judge Arthur Engoron in Manhattan Supreme Court came after a more than two-hour hearing in which lawyers for New York Attorney General Letitia James blasted Trump for dragging his feet in turning over the demanded documents.
"Mr. Trump … I know you take your business seriously, and I take mine seriously.
I hereby hold you in civil contempt," Engoron said, although Trump was not in the courtroom, Reuters reported.

     Summary: A judge holds Donald Trump in contempt of court and fines him $10,000 per dayEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesA judge in New York found former President Donald Trump in contempt of court for failing to produce documents pursuant to a subpoena from state Attorney General Letitia James.
Over the past few months, the probe moved into a new phase when James subpoenaed Trump and his two eldest children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump.
James was seeking testimony directly from the Trumps and documents directly in Donald Trump's custody, as opposed to papers held by the Trump businesses.
"The AG's motion is completely baseless," a spokesperson for the Trump Organization said in recent email.
"President Trump left The Trump Organization in 2017 and any responsive documents were previously provided to the AG by The Trump Organization."

     Summary: April 25 (Reuters) - A New York judge on Monday held former President Donald Trump in contempt of court for not producing documents subpoenaed in the state attorney general's civil probe of his business practices, and ordered Trump to be fined $10,000 per day until he complies.
I hereby hold you in civil contempt," the judge said, although Trump himself was not in the courtroom.
Trump intends to appeal the contempt ruling, said his attorney Alina Habba.
Habba told the judge that Trump did indeed comply with the subpoena, but that he did not have any documents responsive to James' request.
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said this month that probe is ongoing despite the departure of its two top lawyers.

     It’s a Very Bad Day to Be Donald Trump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That undoubtedly came as happy news to Trump, who has spent his entire life escaping consequences for basically everything.
On Monday, a New York judge held the ex-president in contempt for refusing to comply with a subpoena from New York attorney general Letitia James, whose office has also been investigating Trump and the Trump Organization for fraud in a civil case.
That judge, Arthur Engoron, also hit Trump with a fine of $10,000 a day until he coughs up the documents James has requested.
“This file was never searched because the Trump Organization determined, improbably, that Mr. Trump was not involved in the preparation of his own financial statements,” James’s office wrote.

     Summary: A New York judge has held Donald Trump in contempt and fined him $10,000 a day, following the former president’s failure to hand over documents to prosecutors investigating his business practices.
Letitia James, the New York state attorney general, had asked for the contempt finding this month stating that Trump had not complied with a subpoena requiring him to produce documents and information.
James’ ​​civil investigation has focused on whether the Trump Organization misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions.
On Monday, Judge Arthur Engoron, a New York state supreme court judge, agreed with James that Trump was in contempt of court.
For years, Donald Trump has tried to evade the law and stop our lawful investigation into him and his company’s financial dealings.

     Summary: I hereby hold you in civil contempt and fine you $10,000 per day until you purge that contempt," Judge Arthur Engoron said at the hearing, CNN reported.
"Mr. Trump further asserted, subject to his objections, that he would not produce any documents responsive to [our] subpoena."
James' investigation is a civil matter examining whether Trump's business inflated the value of its assets over the years for financial gain.
Lawyers for Trump have denied that he failed to comply with James' subpoena.
James said that the daily $10,000 fine until Trump produces the subpoenaed documents would be "a sum sufficient to coerce his compliance with the court's February 2022 order."
