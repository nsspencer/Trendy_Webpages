     Bhad Bhabie Shares Alleged Receipts on Making $50 Million on OnlyFans After Being Doubted: ‘Go Cry About It B*tch’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bhad Bhabie has responded to those who’ve doubted her recent claim that she made $50 million on OnlyFans by posting an alleged screenshot and video of her earnings.
Since then, Bhad Bhabie has used some of those earnings to snag herself a $6.1 million Florida mansion, with the 9,200-square-foot property located in Boca Raton.
She launched her own label, Bhad Music, back in September of 2021, and said she was inspired by Kanye West to own her own masters.
“Signing a deal when you aren’t established, artists don’t really understand that labels get to approve you doing features and have basically total control on when and if your music comes out,” she said last year.
… I’m finally ready to put out music I want on my own terms.”
