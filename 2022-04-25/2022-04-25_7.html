     Showtime’s ‘The Man Who Fell To Earth’ Represents For Black Women In STEM Both On And Off-Screen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When looking at the lack of Black characters in science fiction, the saying, art imitates life, brings forth a new meaning.
Whether turning on the TV or tapping into the real world, a shared truth that connects the two is that there is a lack of Black representation both onscreen and off-screen in STEM.
However, Showtime’s “The Man Who Fell to Earth,” demonstrates the importance of showcasing how the Black community excels in science on all fronts.
The new sci-fi show follows Faraday (Chiwetel Ejiofor), an alien on a mission to save the planet, who is in need of the help of Justin (Naomie Harris), a single mother that had to hold off on her career as a scientist to take care of her family.
Based on Walter Tevis’ eponymous novel and following after the beloved 1976 film that starred David Bowie, “The Man Who Fell to Earth” was created by Jenny Lumet and Alex Kurtzman.

     The Man Who Fell To Earth: Too Strange of a Stranger in a Strange Land
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Man Who Fell to Earth was a 1976 film based off a 1963 book by Walter Tevis and was the first movie to star the late David Bowie.
The film has developed a cult following for the use of its surreal imagery and is considered an important work of science fiction cinema.
In this golden age of genre media, there are so many wonderful series out there, that no one person can watch them all.
I am sure that The Man Who Fell to Earth will gather a fan base and I am happy for the show.
I am choosing not to continue to watch this series.

     The Man Who Fell to Earth Ruins David Bowie's Iconic Original Role
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warning: SPOILERS for The Man Who Fell To Earth Episode 1 - "Hallo Spaceboy"By reinterpreting it through a modern lens, Showtime's The Man Who Fell To Earth inadvertently ruins David Bowie's iconic role.
Showtime's The Man Who Fell To Earth stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Naomie Harris and picks up the story in the present day.
Indeed, the film's events are also canon in Showtime's The Man Who Fell To Earth, which is otherwise stylistically very different.
Unfortunately, the evolved version of The Man Who Fell To Earth comes off as an Elon Musk/Steve Jobs/Mark Zuckerberg-like caricature.
Next: The Classic Disney Villain David Bowie Almost PlayedThe Man Who Fell To Earth airs Sundays @ 10pm on Showtime.

     Chiwetel Ejiofor talks The Man Who Fell To Earth and these stranger-than-science-fiction times
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, Chiwetel Ejiofor (Doctor Strange, 12 Years A Slave) visits our little blue ball in The Man Who Fell To Earth, a fast-paced sequel to the 1976 sci-fi classic starring David Bowie as spaceman Thomas Newton.
With The Man Who Fell To Earth, Alex Kurtzman and Jenny Lumet are asking really big questions from the viewpoint of somebody who’s experiencing the planet in a completely novel way.
You can only ever find those parts of yourself that remind you of when you’ve been on the outside, isolated.
AdvertisementCE: Obviously, Faraday and Newton are both Anthians; they have a humanoid form in common.
Faraday comes from a place where he does not have that, to Earth, where we have an abundance of resources.

     Chiwetel Ejiofor on playing his own alien in ‘The Man Who Fell to Earth’: ‘You have to find it internally because there’s no other exterior source’ [Exclusive Video Interview]
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An unlikely duo, together they discover that in order to save his world, they must first save ours.
You can’t really look at another person playing an alien and think, ‘Well, I’ll do it like that.’ It’s just not going to work.
You have to find it internally because there’s no other exterior source that we know of, necessarily, where you can go to an alien.
“For an alien, he’s there for assimilating a lot of the different nuances of the human experience,” says Ejiofor.
