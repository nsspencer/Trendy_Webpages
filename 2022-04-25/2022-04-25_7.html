     Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s Fight Left Home Damaged, Witness Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The property manager at an Australian home where Johnny Depp and Amber Heard stayed in 2015 during their tempestuous marriage testified on Monday about the damage he surveyed after one of their most fractious clashes.
The manager, Ben King, described touring the place after the fight and finding a scene of broken glass, blood drippings, a damaged bar top and a collapsed Ping-Pong table.
It was the aftermath of an episode that is emblematic of the dueling accusations that have filled the defamation case filed by Mr. Depp against Ms. Heard.
Mr. Depp has said that during that fight Ms. Heard hurled a vodka bottle at him that shattered and severed his fingertip.
Mr. King testified that he found Mr. Depp’s fingertip in a “scrunched up” piece of paper amid the wreckage.

     Summary: Jurors listen to tense audio recordings at Johnny Depp's libel trialEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Lo Scalzo/AP Jim Lo Scalzo/APEditor's note: This story contains profanity.
FAIRFAX, Va. — Jurors in Johnny Depp's libel lawsuit against his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, on Monday heard audio recordings in which he referred to the violence that could ensue if their arguments were allowed to escalate.
In other audio clips, Depp loudly shouts vulgarities at his wife, calling her a degrading name and yelling, "You stupid f—-" at her.
Depp is suing Heard for libel over a 2018 op-ed piece she wrote in The Washington Post.
Most of the questioning consisted of Ben Rottenborn, Heard's lawyer, playing audio clips or reading vulgar text messages sent by Depp and asking Depp if he'd read them correctly.

     Johnny Depp And Amber Heard’s Trial Takes A Turn For The Surreal

     Summary: Johnny Depp and Amber Heard attend a premiere for 'Black Mass' during the 72nd Venice Film Festival ... [+] at on September 4, 2015 in Venice, Italy.
(Photo by Tristan Fewings/Getty Images) Getty ImagesJohnny Depp’s defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard has taken a surreal turn, as makeup brand Milani took to TikTok to turn footage of the trial into content, an advertisement masquerading as an “epic clapback” that has been viewed at least 4.6 million times.
In the TikTok clip, Milani pushes back against a claim made by one of Amber Heard's lawyers, that Heard used one of the company's concealers to cover up bruises during her abusive marriage to Johnny Depp.
Footage of the trial has been live-streaming on various platforms since April 11, like a star-studded episode of Judge Judy, with multiple celebrities dragged into the mess.
Nothing, it seems, is off-limits; everything is content, and content can be used to push merchandise, even if said merchandise is associated with a domestic abuse case.
