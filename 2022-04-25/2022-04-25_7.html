     Summary: TOKYO, April 25 (Reuters) - A Japanese woman believed to have been the world's oldest person has died aged 119, public broadcaster NHK said on Monday, reporting the death of Kane Tanaka.
Born on Jan. 2, 1903 - the year of the Wright Brothers' first controlled flight of their motor-driven airplane - Tanaka was confirmed by Guinness World Records in 2019 as the oldest living person.

     Summary: The world's oldest person, Japan's Kane Tanaka, dies at age 119Enlarge this image toggle caption Kyodo/Reuters Kyodo/ReutersAlthough she didn't quite make it to her goal of 120 years old, Kane Tanaka still lived long enough to become the world's oldest person — a title she held for the past three years, and attributed to family, sleep, hope and faith.
Tanaka died last week at 119, Japanese authorities announced.
During a 2019 presentation ceremony to celebrate her being the oldest person alive, she was given a box of chocolates — which she immediately opened and began devouring.
Earlier this month, Tanaka surpassed Sarah Knauss of the U.S. to become the second-longest lived person in recorded history.
The oldest currently living person is now said to be Lucile Randon, a 118-year-old French nun.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kane Tanaka was recognised as the world's oldest person in 2019Tokyo (AFP) – A Japanese woman certified the world's oldest person has died at the age of 119, local officials said Monday.
Tanaka was in relatively good health until recently and lived at a nursing home, where she enjoyed board games, solving maths problems, soda and chocolate.
When the Guinness World Records recognised her as the oldest person alive in 2019, she was asked what moment she was the most happy in life.
Japan has the world's most elderly population, according to World Bank data, with around 28 percent aged 65 or over.
The oldest-ever living person verified by Guinness was Frenchwoman Jeanne Louise Calment, who died aged 122 years and 164 days in 1997.
