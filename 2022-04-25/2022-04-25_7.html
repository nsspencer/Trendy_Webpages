     Security Footage of DaBaby’s Fatal 2018 Walmart Shooting Raises Questions About Self-Defense Claim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DaBaby’s fatal 2018 shooting of 19-year-old Jaylin Craig is the subject of a new investigative report featuring previously unreleased footage.
On Sunday, Rolling Stone shared an extensive piece on the shooting, which DaBaby has claimed was carried out in self-defense.
As previously reported, the shooting took place at a Walmart in North Carolina on Nov. 5, 2018.
Security footage, per the report, sees DaBaby punching “a blindsided Douglas” and later pulling out a Glock and shooting Craig.
The Walmart footage at the center of the new Rolling Stone piece was included in a police file on Craig’s case retrieved by Horsley last April.

The security footage – obtained by Rolling Stone and published for the first time on Sunday –appears to show DaBaby, whose real name is Jonathan Kirk, as the initial aggressor.
The men continue to scuffle as Jaylin Craig, Douglas’ friend, is seen discretely pulling out a handgun and walking over toward them.

DaBaby was filmed getting into a physical altercation with an artist from his label weeks before the home intruder incident.

     Previously Unreleased Video Casts Doubt On DaBaby's Self-Defense Claim In 2018 Walmart Murder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charlotte, NC – DaBaby was on the verge of superstardom when he was cleared in the November 2018 murder of Jaylin Craig.
The KIRK rapper claimed he shot the 19-year-old North Carolina native in self-defense after a chance encounter at a Charlotte-area Walmart.
But in newly obtained video by Rolling Stone, DaBaby’s self-defense claim appears to be called into question.
Craig thought he saw DaBaby in the store but was thrown off by his subdued clothing and the fact he was shopping for baby clothes in a Walmart.
While Douglas says he never saw Craig draw a weapon, DaBaby told police they saw Craig pull a gun out he was fighting with Douglas.
