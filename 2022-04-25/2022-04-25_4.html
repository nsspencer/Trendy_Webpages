     Texas Court Halts Execution of Mother Convicted of Killing Child
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HOUSTON — The highest criminal court in Texas on Monday ordered a halt to the execution of a Hispanic mother of 14 convicted of killing her 2-year-old child more than a decade ago in a case that has drawn bipartisan outrage.
The mother, Melissa Lucio, has long maintained her innocence, and calls for leniency have become widespread in Texas, including among dozens of Democratic and Republican state legislators, as new evidence and expert testimony emerged that cast strong doubt on her guilt.
In a three-page decision ordering a stay to the execution that had been set for Wednesday, the Court of Criminal Appeals found that several of the claims raised by her lawyers needed to be considered by a trial court, including that prosecutors may have used false testimony, that previously unavailable scientific evidence could preclude her conviction and that prosecutors suppressed other evidence that would have been favorable to her.
The case now returns to a lower court to resolve those issues, postponing the execution indefinitely.
Ms. Lucio would have been the first Hispanic woman executed in Texas.

     Summary: Texas court orders a stay of execution for Melissa Lucio to review the caseEnlarge this image toggle caption AP APAn appeals court in Texas has halted the execution of Melissa Lucio, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, over questions about her innocence and concerns over the trial that led to her conviction.
The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas issued a stay of execution Monday and sent that case back to a lower court for review, a decision that was met with praise by her attorneys, criminal justice advocates and Lucio herself.
"I am grateful the Court has given me the chance to live and prove my innocence," she said in a statement provided by her legal team.
Lucio was convicted 14 years ago of murdering her 2-year-old daughter, Mariah, and later sentenced to death.
Greg Abbott and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles asking them to grant her clemency, Houston Public Media reported.

     Melissa Lucio: Court stays execution of Texas death row prisoner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A court in Texas has granted a stay of execution for Melissa Lucio, who was convicted of murdering her two-year-old daughter, after new evidence emerged.
Lucio was set to be executed by lethal injection on Wednesday, and would have become the first Hispanic woman to be put to death in Texas.
However, the appeals court on Monday granted a request by Lucio’s lawyers to delay the execution so a lower court can review her claims that new evidence would exonerate her.
The paroles board did not review her clemency petition because of the execution stay.
If the case were to come back before the board in the future, Lucio’s lawyers would have to file a new petition.

     Summary: The Texas court of criminal appeals has issued a stay of execution for Melissa Lucio, the Mexican-American woman who was set to be judicially killed within 48 hours, ordering a lower court to consider new evidence of her innocence in the death of her two-year-old daughter Mariah.
The court issued its order on Monday as the final clock was ticking on Lucio’s transfer to the death chamber.

In a statement, Lucio thanked the court of criminal appeals for giving her the chance “to live and prove my innocence.
Leach has been at the forefront of efforts by Texas lawmakers to persuade the authorities to postpone the execution.

     Texas court grants stay of execution for death row inmate Melissa Lucio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Monday granted a stay of execution for Melissa Lucio , halting her execution scheduled for Wednesday and sending her case back to the trial court to review new evidence.
Lucio, her family, advocates and attorneys say she was wrongfully convicted of capital murder in the 2007 death of her toddler Mariah.
The court's ruling delays Lucio's execution while the trial court considers the merits of her claims.
According to Lucio's attorneys, the trial court in Brownsville will hold proceedings to hear the evidence of Lucio's innocence.
Separately, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday declined to make a clemency recommendation in Lucio's case, citing the stay of execution.
