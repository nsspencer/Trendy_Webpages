by Candice EvansThe Chicago Bulls arch nemesis Grayson Allen shot the team down in Game 3 of their first round series against the Milwaukee Bucks.
That streak has continued into Game 4, as Allen leads the Bucks in scoring at halftime— despite heavy antagonizing from the Chicago crowd.
Grayson Allen is getting heavy boos, but he continues to deliver in Chicago in this series.
After the play, Allen was seen laughing on the sideline prior to being ejected.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Many are still absolutely angry at him after he injured Chicago Bulls guard Alex Caruso last January.
But it has become clear that the Milwaukee Bucks guard isn’t fazed at all.
He was heavily booed by the fans of the Bulls throughout the game, but he has learned to tune them out.
The Bucks jeer Allen as well during practices and film sessions or when they’re on the bus or in a hotel.
Allen knows he’s considered a villain in the NBA, and he fires back by helping the Bucks win.

     Summary: How Grayson Allen’s offensive explosion has swung the series for the Milwaukee BucksAllen’s first two games weren’t necessarily bad, he just wasn’t noticeable or making nearly enough of an impact.
In the last two games, Allen had 49 points on… wait for it… 98.47 percent true shooting!
He also doesn’t let the Bucks be as versatile defensively, but he’s still a solid enough defender.
They say role players play better at home, but that hasn’t been the case for Allen in the first round.
The Milwaukee Bucks will get the chance to close out their division rival at home on Wednesday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grayson Allen stays hot with 27 points and six 3-pointers in the Bucks' Game 4 victory over the Bulls.
(1:10)CHICAGO -- In the days leading up to the team's first road playoff games in Chicago, the Milwaukee Bucks used every opportunity they could to shower Grayson Allen with boos.
So when Allen set back-to-back playoff career highs in Games 3 and 4 this weekend to help Milwaukee take a commanding 3-1 series lead over Chicago, the Bucks bench enjoyed booing him all the way.
Even if he has gained a reputation as a villain in Chicago, Allen insisted after the game Sunday that he does not feed off such a negative reaction.
After leading all scorers in Game 3 on Friday with 22 points, Allen was even better on Sunday afternoon.

The ultimate joy out there for me is just playing, have fun, play free.
I’m not going out searching for it, like, oh I love this…”And yet where would the Bucks be right now without Allen?

Here's three takeaways from Game 4 between the Bucks and the Bulls.
Grayson Allen's encoreAfter dropping 22 points in Game 3, Allen once again torched the Bulls to the tune of a 27-point performance.
Though Allen says he doesn't feed off the boos, it's been working for him and the Bucks, so Milwaukee might as well keep it up.
Even in Chicago's Game 2 win in Milwaukee, it took DeRozan going off for 41 points to carry the Bulls to a win.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some Bucks fans still held out from praising the newcomer Allen, but as we moved into 2022, those opinions grew fainter.
Game 1 was an uninspiring victory that didn’t leave a great taste in the mouths of Bucks fans.
Among Bucks fans and national media voices alike, the conversation after the result of the first two games was grim.
Gianns and company built serious character during those series and if there’s anyone who shouldn’t discount this, it’s Bucks fans.
Of course, they had generational star, but so does this Bucks team.
