    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It took Hernandez just five short days to remind us that ... yup, he still stinks at his job.
Per the Umpire Auditor, a Twitter account with over 60,000 followers that keeps track of every bad call on a given day in baseball, Hernandez, who was behind the plate for the Philadelphia Philles vs. Milwaukee Brewers game on Sunday Night Baseball, was the lowest-rated umpire of the day.
Keep in mind, it's a bit of an arbitrary "rating" since there is no set strike zone every single game and there is still a human element to umping.
Still, no one is going to disagree when it calls out Hernandez's performance.

     Umpire Angel Hernández Facing Criticism After Phillies-Brewers Game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everybody’s favorite umpire had himself a game for the ages on Sunday Night Baseball.
Stationed behind home plate for a nationally-televised game between the Brewers and Phillies on Sunday, Hernández was in rare form.
The Twitter account @UmpScorecards uses pitch-by-pitch data from MLB to evaluate how accurately and consistently umpires call balls and strikes.
Unsurprisingly, players from both teams were visibly agitated at Hernández’s performance, leading to some animated exchanges all night.
Players and coaches for the Brewers and Phillies, unsurprisingly, weren’t the only ones who took Sunday night as an opportunity to lob criticism at Hernández’s performance.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MLB umpire Angel Hernandez had a night to forget behind the plate during Sunday’s nationally televised matchup between the Phillies and Brewers.
All night, his strike zone was all over the place.
And as that brutal night boiled over in Kyle Schwarber’s outburst and ejection, Angels pitcher Noah Syndergaard was watching the game from afar like the rest of us.
Spoken like a true pitcher, Syndergaard hilariously came in with the best back-handed endorsement of Hernandez’s strike zone.
I'm here for Angel Hernandez strike zone FOREVER.#AngelsUnite — Noah Syndergaard (@Noahsyndergaard) April 25, 2022Of course, Hernandez has also been known to call would-be strikes as balls (which would hurt the pitcher).

     WATCH: Phillies' Kyle Schwarber loses his mind, is ejected after bad third-strike call by Angel Hernandez
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Our champion here would be Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber.
Background: Both sides were unhappy with Hernandez due to his, um, we'll say inconsistent strike zone throughout the game that aired nationally as ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball.
Schwarber himself was rung up on a pitch outside the zone in his previous at-bat, so there was plenty of baggage here.
Schwarber correctly goes to take his base, but he's rung up by Hernandez.
The only let down was Phillies manager Joe Girardi being so subdued, though he did say he was open to an automated strike zone after the game.

     Angel Hernandez had a bad night in the Brewers-Phillies game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadBaseball’s strike zone remains subject to interpretation, which means spit-flying arguments at home plate are still part of the game.
Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber lost his temper on home plate umpire Angel Hernandez after a questionable strike three call in the ninth inning of Philadelphia’s 1-0 loss to Milwaukee.
According to baseball’s data, pitches in that location are called balls 59 percent of the time.
“Everyone kind of saw what was going on,” Schwarber told reporters after the game.
It was the eighth-worst called game since the start of 2021, according to pitch location data, and the missed calls amounted to a one-run advantage for the pitchers after factoring in the count for each pitch — a huge number in a 1-0 game.

     Summary: Throughout the night, Hernandez drew the ire of both teams for his faulty strike zone.
Schwarber had been victimized by Hernandez' interpretation of the strike zone three innings earlier.
According to the data, Hernandez called a total of nine strikes on Phillies hitters that were out of the zone.
That's why I'm kind of for the automated strike zone.
Schwarber does not favor an automated strike zone.
