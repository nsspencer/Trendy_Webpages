     Phillies' Kyle Schwarber loses it, ejected for calling out Angel Hernandez's shifting strike zone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the bottom of the ninth inning, Hernández rung up outfielder Kyle Schwarber on a strike three call that appeared to be off the plate in a full count.
Kyle Schwarber — not a fan of this called third strike by Angel Hernandez.
ESPN's announcers had no grievance with Schwarber's tantrum, saying Schwarber was "speaking for both sides" on the broadcast.
Rather, as Schwarber indicates with his hands, Hernández had been woefully inconsistent no matter who was at the plate.
Schwarber had every intention of getting run out after that called strike three, and he made sure he got his money's worth.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hernandez was behind the plate Sunday night for a Phillies-Brewers matchup and blew repeated calls – much to the chagrin of players and fans alike.
The 60-year-old missed 19 calls, including calling a strike for a pitch that missed the the box by a season-high 6.47 inches.
One Phillies fan wanted to speak his mind to Hernandez after the game and waited for him in the parking lot.
Angel Hernandez missed 19 calls during Sunday’s game.
Schwarber returned once more to remind Hernandez of what a terrible job he was doing before leaving the game.

     Kyle Schwarber loses it on Angel Hernandez after questionable strikeout call
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyle Schwarber did what plenty of other MLB players have likely thought of doing over the years on Sunday night.
The Phillies star went ballistic on home plate umpire Angel Hernandez after a questionable strikeout call in the ninth inning of a game that had a number of them — from an ump with a history of getting calls wrong.
Schwarber took a 3-2 sinker from Brewers closer Josh Hader that he thought was off the outside corner.
But it was called a strike by Hernandez for the second out of the inning in a game the host Phillies would lose 1-0.
We saw them as players went back to the bench.”Kyle Schwarber argues with Angel Hernandez after striking out in the 9th inning.

     Kyle Schwarber, Joe Girardi react to Angel Hernandez' strike zone in Phillies loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Throughout the night, Hernandez drew the ire of both teams for his faulty strike zone.
Schwarber had been victimized by Hernandez' interpretation of the strike zone three innings earlier.
According to the data, Hernandez called a total of nine strikes on Phillies hitters that were out of the zone.
That's why I'm kind of for the automated strike zone.
Schwarber does not favor an automated strike zone.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With one out, Phillies left fielder Kyle Schwarber was called out on strikes on a 3-2 pitch.
The pitch was actually outside, but umpire Ángel Hernández rung up Schwarber, who spiked his bat and helmet, and went on a brief but epic tirade.
After the game, Schwarber spoke with the media about Hernández and the call.
“I’m not here to bury anyone, but it wasn’t very good,” Schwarber told the Philadelphia Inquirer.
I’m pro-umpire,” Schwarber told MLB.com.

     Summary: There’s very little you can do to earn an immediate – and I mean *IMMEDIATE* – ejection from a game, but Kyle Schwarber managed the feat tonight.
Schwarber was right to be pissed.
Oh, maybe, maybe not.
But apparently it was a cumulative thing throughout the game, as it, eh hem, sometimes is with Angel Hernandez.
The episode was reminiscent of an end-of-game Schwarber ejection back with the Cubs, where he was also understandably angry.
