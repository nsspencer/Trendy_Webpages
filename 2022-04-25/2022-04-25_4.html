     Sports Illustrated Atlanta Hawks News, Analysis and More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If there was one area where the Hawks had the advantage in this series, it would be the paint.
Given Bam Adebayo's struggles this series and the availability of both John Collins and Clint Capela, the Hawks should have cleaned up around the rim last night.
Instead, they got outrebounded 48-41 and outscored in the paint 48-26.
Even more confounding is that the Heat played their small-ball rotation in Game Four.
There is no excuse for the Hawks' frontcourt to have played so poorly last night.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Atlanta Hawks were looking great early in the second period.
The Heat put on a 26-4 run and the Hawks were on the back foot going into halftime.
The Atlanta Hawks are in desperate need to a second star.
In this game Young had nine points and five assists which goes to show how well the Heat can defend.
In all honesty, the Atlanta Hawks need to go all-in to get this second star becuase without this star power, they are not going to make it as deep into the playoffs as they would want.

     Summary: The Miami Heat hit Tuesday with one goal: Find a way to win another game against the Atlanta Hawks.
"We have some gnarly competitors in our locker room that love big challenges," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.
The Heat went without point guard Kyle Lowry in Game 4, but that didn't seem to limit Miami.
"A lot of it was our defensive toughness and versatility and making it tough, which is not easy against this team," Spoelstra said.
As much as guard play has been emphasized in the series, the Hawks haven't received much in the post.

     Summary: The Miami Heat just put on a clinic in how to control and win an NBA playoff game: Limit your own mistakes, and take away what the other team does best.
Jimmy Butler, who's far away been the best player in this series, finished with 33 points on 11-of-20 shooting.
Also, are you ready for this: The Hawks didn't score a single fast-break point.
The Hawks made one desperate run to pull out Game 3, but Miami has been throughout this series, and is, the far superior team.
It was never going to lose without beating itself or getting upended by a Trae Young hurricane.

     Hawks, Trae Young haven’t found answers against Heat defense
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite his heroics in Game 3, Young is shooting 35% in four games, stifled by Miami’s wing defenders.
Young shot 2-for-17 on 3-pointers across the first two games, an unsustainably bad showing, and improved to just 5-for-16 (31%) in the two home contests.
Young, limited to playing in four of those six games, shot 43% and just 27% on 3-pointers.
Young has been held to single-digit points in two of the series’ games, including nine Sunday.
Young is turning the ball over six times a game against Miami; he averaged four turnovers per game in the regular season.

     Shorthanded Heat Respond with 24-point Win Over Hawks in Game 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Things looked like they were swinging in Atlanta’s favor on Sunday evening leading up to their Game Four clash with the Miami Heat.
But in Game Four, the Heat defensive unit moved like a finely tuned machine.
Miami forced Atlanta into 15 turnovers and held the Hawks to their lowest point total of the series so far.
Despite missing floor general Kyle Lowry, the Heat operated smoothly in Game Four as they coasted to a 3-1 series lead.
What heat fans should be most excited about is how naturally Oladipo fit into the Miami line up.
