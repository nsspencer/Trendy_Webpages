     Stats show that Angel Hernandez truly had a horrific night even before Kyle Schwarber's outburst
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MLB fans saw the real Angel Hernandez on ESPN’s Sunday Night Baseball, and oh man, it wasn’t pretty.
Schwarber could be seen telling Hernandez that he was making awful calls all over the place for both teams.
According to Umpire Auditor, Hernandez was the worst-performing umpire of the night, missing calls on 19 (!!!)
Umpire Angel Hernandez was the lowest rated umpire on the day, missing 19 calls for a correct percentage of 85.3%.
They had him at an overall accuracy of 88 percent with 16 missed calls on taken pitches.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That honor belonged to home-plate umpire Angel Hernandez.
Now that Joe West is no longer presiding over MLB games like an ill-tempered grandpa, Hernandez stands alone as the ump most likely to hijack a game.
Hernandez was in rare form last night—according to @UmpireAuditor, he missed 19 calls and rang up six batters on third strikes that were outside the zone.
Kyle Schwarber, like all of us, has had enough of Angel Hernandez's bull shit.
Let us try to agree that a game umpired by Angel Hernandez is not one undone by an incompetent fool, but one afflicted by a natural disaster beyond anyone’s control.

     WATCH: Phillies' Kyle Schwarber loses his mind, is ejected after bad third-strike call by Angel Hernandez
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Our champion here would be Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber.
Background: Both sides were unhappy with Hernandez due to his, um, we'll say inconsistent strike zone throughout the game that aired nationally as ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball.
Schwarber himself was rung up on a pitch outside the zone in his previous at-bat, so there was plenty of baggage here.
Schwarber correctly goes to take his base, but he's rung up by Hernandez.
The only let down was Phillies manager Joe Girardi being so subdued, though he did say he was open to an automated strike zone after the game.

     Phillies fan confronts Angel Hernandez in parking lot after another awful night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hernandez was behind the plate Sunday night for a Phillies-Brewers matchup and blew repeated calls – much to the chagrin of players and fans alike.
The 60-year-old missed 19 calls, including calling a strike for a pitch that missed the the box by a season-high 6.47 inches.
One Phillies fan wanted to speak his mind to Hernandez after the game and waited for him in the parking lot.
Angel Hernandez missed 19 calls during Sunday’s game.
Schwarber returned once more to remind Hernandez of what a terrible job he was doing before leaving the game.

     Summary: Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber lost his temper on home plate umpire Angel Hernandez after a questionable strike three call in the ninth inning of Philadelphia’s 1-0 loss to Milwaukee.
According to baseball’s own pitch data, pitches in that location are called balls 59 percent of the time.
“Everyone kind of saw what was going on,” Schwarber told reporters after the game.
He called two other pitches strikes that are called balls 90 percent of the timeBy the end of the night, Hernandez called just 209 out of 245 pitches correctly, per baseball’s data, the fifth-worst correct-call rate of the season.
Umpires tend to get far more ball-strike calls right than wrong, but this was a particularly poor showing from Hernandez.

     Summary: Throughout the night, Hernandez drew the ire of both teams for his faulty strike zone.
Schwarber had been victimized by Hernandez' interpretation of the strike zone three innings earlier.
According to the data, Hernandez called a total of nine strikes on Phillies hitters that were out of the zone.
That's why I'm kind of for the automated strike zone.
Schwarber does not favor an automated strike zone.

I'm here for Angel Hernandez strike zone FOREVER.#AngelsUnite — Noah Syndergaard (@Noahsyndergaard) April 25, 2022Of course, Hernandez has also been known to call would-be strikes as balls (which would hurt the pitcher).
