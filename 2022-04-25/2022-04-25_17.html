     The Man Who Fell To Earth: Too Strange of a Stranger in a Strange Land
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Man Who Fell to Earth was a 1976 film based off a 1963 book by Walter Tevis and was the first movie to star the late David Bowie.
The film has developed a cult following for the use of its surreal imagery and is considered an important work of science fiction cinema.
In this golden age of genre media, there are so many wonderful series out there, that no one person can watch them all.
I am sure that The Man Who Fell to Earth will gather a fan base and I am happy for the show.
I am choosing not to continue to watch this series.

     Summary: This review of The Man Who Fell to Earth is spoiler-free.
He’s well dressed and well-spoken, a billionaire playboy type, giving something halfway between a TED Talk and a product demonstration.
He begins to convince her of the truth in what he’s saying; of, in a roundabout way, her own importance.
The original novel is quite a serious work and builds to an extraordinarily bleak and cynical ending.
You can stream The Man Who Fell to Earth exclusively on Showtime.

     The Man Who Fell to Earth Ruins David Bowie's Iconic Original Role
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warning: SPOILERS for The Man Who Fell To Earth Episode 1 - "Hallo Spaceboy"By reinterpreting it through a modern lens, Showtime's The Man Who Fell To Earth inadvertently ruins David Bowie's iconic role.
Showtime's The Man Who Fell To Earth stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Naomie Harris and picks up the story in the present day.
Indeed, the film's events are also canon in Showtime's The Man Who Fell To Earth, which is otherwise stylistically very different.
Unfortunately, the evolved version of The Man Who Fell To Earth comes off as an Elon Musk/Steve Jobs/Mark Zuckerberg-like caricature.
Next: The Classic Disney Villain David Bowie Almost PlayedThe Man Who Fell To Earth airs Sundays @ 10pm on Showtime.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Originally a Hulu production back in 2019, The Man Who Fell to Earth didn't make the cut after Disney took over 20th Century Fox's assets.
The Man Who Fell to Earth is not your average alien invasion story.
At its core, The Man Who Fell to Earth series is a story about grief, the turmoil of change, and navigating the flood of emotions that come with reliving a past that you cannot return to.
The Man Who Fell to Earth series is not simply a story about an alien becoming human.
The Man Who Fell to Earth airs Sundays on Showtime at 10 p.m. Eastern.

“I was familiar with his music but hadn’t ever seen him in concert and I’m glad I never did because I would have been too awestruck during our scenes,” Clark said of Bowie.
And he was very focused.”Naomie Harris and Chiwetel Ejiofor star in the Showtime version of “The Man Who Fell to Earth,” which premiered April 24.
“I don’t know how he found my address but it was David Bowie, and there, behind him, was the [blue] limousine from the movie [in which Thomas Newtown was driven around].
