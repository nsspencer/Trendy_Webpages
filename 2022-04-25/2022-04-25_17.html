     Federal judge will temporarily block Biden administration from lifting Title 42
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON – A federal judge said he will temporarily block the Biden administration from ending the Trump-era Title 42 policy that expels migrants from the United States’ borders to avoid the spread of COVID-19.
"The parties will confer regarding the specific terms to be contained in the Temporary Restraining Order and attempt to reach agreement."
Since coming into office, the Biden administration has embraced it under the same justification, denying critics' assertions they are using it to curb immigration.
The ruling comes as Republicans and some moderate Democrats have called on the Biden administration to delay ending the policy.
Title 42 is still currently being used on the ground until May 23.

     Title 42: Federal judge temporarily blocks Biden administration from ending pandemic immigration rule
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A federal judge in Louisiana temporarily blocked the Biden administration from ending a Trump-era pandemic restriction on the US-Mexico border.
The Biden administration had been on track to end the public health authority, known as Title 42, on May 23, a decision that has been criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike.
The measure allows border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries because of the public health crisis.
"The Court discussed the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order [ECF No.
The parties will confer regarding the specific terms to be contained in the Temporary Restraining Order and attempt to reach agreement," Summerhays wrote Monday.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal judge in Louisiana said Monday he will block the Biden administration from lifting a public health order that keeps immigrants seeking asylum out of the United States.
It would stop President Joe Biden from ending the policy known as Title 42, first put in place during the Trump administration.
The administration had said it would end next month the emergency order that allowed immigration authorities to expel those seeking asylum.
Former President Donald Trump appointed Summerhays to the federal judgeship in Louisiana, where he has served since 2018.
The Trump administration first put Title 42 in effect during the first wave of pandemic restrictions in March 2020.

     Judge to block U.S. border officials from winding down Title 42 expulsion policy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's not yet clear if the order will block the administration from ending Title 42 on May 23, or if it will only prohibit them from starting to wind down the policy before then.
"The parties will confer regarding the specific terms to be contained in the Temporary Restraining Order and attempt to reach agreement."
The CDC said it would stop authorizing Title 42 on May 23 to give border officials time to make preparations.
"We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42."
Editors note: This story was updated to clarify the issue the judge's temporary restraining order is expected to address.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I am so proud of the lawyers from our office who just got a Temporary Restraining Order to keep Title 42 in place,” tweeted Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich on Monday.
Title 42 was set to expire May 23.
“If President Biden lifts Title 42, what we see today will be much worse,” McCarthy said.
McCarthy said repealing Title 42 will further destabilize the border at a time when migrant encounters are surging.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed last week that the Biden administration was preparing for the end of Title 42 on May 23.

     Judge Will Temporarily Block Biden From Ending Title 42 Border Restrictions
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineA federal judge said Monday he will temporarily block the Biden Administration’s decision to end Title 42 border restrictions, which allow U.S. border agents to rapidly expel or turn away migrants due to Covid-19 health risks, four days after 21 states voiced their opposition to repealing the Trump-era rule next month.
The 21 mostly Republican-led states asking Summerhays to stop the administration from ending Title 42 include Alabama, Arizona, Florida and Texas.
That’s how many expulsions have been carried out under Title 42 since the policy was first imposed in March 2020, according to Customs and Border Protection.
The actual number of people impacted by Title 42 is likely smaller because many migrants attempt to cross the border multiple times, CBP says.
