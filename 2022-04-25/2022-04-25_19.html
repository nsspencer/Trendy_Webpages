    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Instead, Georgia's Travon Walker has entered the conversation following an impressive combine and pro-day.
A surprising ascension for Walker for those who didn't pay close attention to Georgia over the 12 months.
Then as the attention turned to the pre-draft festivities, Davis's teammates DeVonte Wyatt and Travon Walker started to dominate the conversations.
Even those in Vegas who set the betting odds for the number one overall pick did not see this as a possibility for Walker.
Now on Monday, the DraftKings sportsbook lists Walker as the favorite at -150 to become the number pick, overtaking former favorite Michigan edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson.

     Getting Drafty: Travon Walker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Travon Walker is the kind of versatile big athlete that the folks who stock NFL rosters have been conditioned to go ga-ga over.
They smile at the notion of him setting the edge in run defense in their 3-4.
Because Travon Walker can do all of those things.
But Travon Walker really is a player whose impact is belied by a cursory glance at the stats page.
And if Walker irons out some of the inconsistencies in his game there’s no question he could be a stalwart on an NFL defense.

     Summary: If you’re looking for a solid, Pro Bowl player who will start for a decade, 2022 is your year.
“Again, you’re looking at them, you’re looking at how they made their plays, how they were used, and then you have a vision for how you can use them.
In Walker, you’re hoping he’s J.J. Watt — but taken even further.
The shared DNA between these players: Upside over production.
Whatever potential and perceived upside Travon Walker has is vastly outweighed by the risk.

     NFL draft: Who is Travon Walker and why is he now favored to go No. 1 overall?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 1 overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft was born with the Christian name of Yuri.
Based on recent comments from Jaguars GM Trent Baalke, it appears Jacksonville has a final four of Walker, Hutchinson, Neal and Ekwonu.
So is Travon Walker worth taking first overall — or even top five, for that matter?
It’s clear he’s not your garden-variety top pick, and that appears to say as much about the top of the 2022 NFL draft as it does Walker himself.
That’s how they should all look, but few do.”Nowhere are looks more deceiving than in the NFL draft.
