     Supernatural Star Misha Collins Walks Back Allusion to Being Bisexual
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Update: 4/25/22 3:30 p.m.:Supernatural star Misha Collins apologized on Twitter for “misspeaking” at a convention panel that left many fans believing the actor had come out as bisexual.
“My clumsy intention was to wave off actually discussing my sexuality, but I badly fumbled that and understand that was seen as me coming out as bisexual,” Collins wrote, adding definitively, “I am not bisexual.
Collins concluded the Twitter thread with another apology for “the clumsiness of [his] language,” pledging to “do better” and “keep listening.”Original 4/25/22 11:00 a.m.:Supernatural star Misha Collins has apparently come out as bisexual — a sentence that doubles as a sleeper agent activation phrase for anyone who was entirely too online in the 2010s.
The actor alluded to his sexuality during a panel at the Supernatural Official Convention this past weekend in East Brunswick, New Jersey.
In a video posted to Twitter, Collins is seen asking the crowd how many of them are introverts, how many of them are extroverts, and, for some reason, how many of them are bisexual, the last of which garnered a collective “woo!” from the crowd.

     'Supernatural' Star Misha Collins Casually Comes Out as Bisexual
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Supernatural Star Misha Collins Casually Comes Out as BisexualIt's been almost two years since the beloved CW series Supernatural concluded after fifteen seasons, but fans are still as rabid as ever.
Conventions still go on regularly around the world and at a recent one in New Jersey over the weekend, star Misha Collings (who played the fallen angel Castiel) casually opened up about his sexuality.
It seems to be a casual coming-out moment for Collins but he has not responded to online fan inquiries about it since Saturday.
His character, Castiel, caused quite the controversy in the penultimate episode of the long-running TV series.
At the time, both Collins and producers said that they "all knew Castiel was in love with Dean."
