     Heat's Victor Oladipo: Confirmed starter for Game 5
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Oladipo will start Tuesday's Game 5 against Atlanta.
As expected, Oladipo will, indeed, get the nod at small forward as the Heat look to close out the Hawks without the services of Jimmy Butler (knee).
Kyle Lowry (hamstring) will also sit out, so Miami will lean more heavily than usual on Oladipo and Gabe Vincent, as well as Tyler Herro off the bench.
Oladipo finished Sunday's Game 4 -- his Heat playoff debut -- with six points (3-10 FG, 0-5 3Pt), eight rebounds and four assists in 23 minutes off the bench.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Heat became the second team to make it to the second round of the playoffs by winning Game 5 against the Hawks and closing the series 4-1.
Victor Oladipo, who spent the first three game of the series on the bench, was given a starting spot in absence of Jimmy Butler.
The 29-year-old shooting guard stepped up to the occasion by scoring team-high 23 points.
After the game he talked about the difficulties that he has faced in his life and how he continues to run through obstacles.
If you have it, you will at some point in your life,” Oladipo said.

     Miami Heat Playoffs: Victor Oladipo Has To Remain In Rotation, Right?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat got a crucial Game 5 victory on Tuesday night and they did it the hard way.
The Miami Heat would also be without two of their top-four guys in Kyle Lowry and Jimmy Butler.
The Miami Heat got a great Victor Oladipo showing in Tuesday night’s closeout Game 5.
Should Victor Oladipo remain in the Miami Heat playoff rotation beyond this point?
The Miami Heat have thrived with their depth all season long and where it’s usually a strength to cut your rotation down in the postseason, the Miami Heat could use their depth as a strength this postseason.

     Summary: It was Oladipo who stepped up for his team, exploding for a team-high 23 points in 36 minutes of action.
After the game, Oladipo had an inspirational message as he discussed his journey to where he’s sitting today.
I could’ve stopped, or I could have run right through it.
And I'm still running through it" @VicOladipo pic.twitter.com/0GFZTWx5jO — NBA (@NBA) April 27, 2022Even this season, many had already counted out Oladipo after he failed to make a significant impact for the Heat.
He was in and out of the lineup as the former second overall pick fought to get back to game shape following a lengthy injury spell.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: -- But when the Heat are whole, and when Tyler Herro is closer to the top of his game, Oladipo mostly is needed to complement.
-- With Butler and Lowry out, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra moved Oladipo into his starting lineup.
-- Herro’s second free throw moved him past Brown for 16th on the Heat all-time playoff list.
-- Adebayo’s third free-throw attempt moved him past Tim Hardaway for ninth on the Heat all-time playoff list.
We’re averaging 98 points a game.”-- The Hawks then had two first-half fast-break points.
