     We Own This City review: A shocking police corruption tale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Their latest miniseries, We Own This City, based on the book of the same name by Baltimore Sun reporter Justin Fenton, chronicles the real-life story of the Baltimore Police Department's Gun Trace Task Force (GTTF), an elite unit that ruled the city like a roving gang of thieves.
They wrongfully searched civilians and stole money from them, planted drugs and guns, and generally acted with brutal impunity, all with the protection of a badge.
In 2017, all eight members of the GTTF were arrested on charges of federal racketeering and all were eventually sentenced to multiple years in prison.
His devolution into an aggressive thug serves as the series' backbone, but per their wont, Simon and Pelecanos branch out laterally across multiple different fields.
An escalating problemWe Own This City sports an intriguing non-linear structure that initially seems haphazard but quickly reveals itself to be thematically compelling.

     We Own This City Premiere Recap: Bad Cops, Fat Pockets — Grade It!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There are two important things to know while watching HBO’s new limited series We Own This City.
This is to be expected in the inaugural installment, which premiered Monday on HBO, because the table has to be set.
In a post-Freddie Gray Baltimore, Bernthal’s Jenkins was shown giving a rousing speech on why brutality is the antithesis of solid police work.
The Gun Trace Task Force boss passionately argued that in order to get information out of suspects, they had to talk to them, not beat them in the head.
A younger Jenkins was shown breaking a liquor bottle in one man’s hand because public drinking is illegal.

     Summary: The Gray case brought federal scrutiny to the department's actions, with Wunmi Mosaku ("Loki") playing Nicole Steele, an attorney with the Justice Dept.
's Civil Rights division investigating police corruption, working against a deadline knowing the Trump administration might not follow through on her efforts.
Other key figures include Jon Bernthal ("The Punisher") as Sgt.
Wayne Jenkins, a rogue officer whose exploits are documented through those aforementioned flashbacks; and Jamie Hector ("The Wire") as Sean M. Suiter, a detective who begins to face uncomfortable questions regarding his past.
As with "The Wire," "We Own This City" provides a granular look at the bureaucratic dysfunction that allowed certain cops to operate so brazenly, including the leverage wielded by officers over department and city officials concerned about their own careers and election prospects.

     What’s the Story Behind HBO’s ‘We Own This City’?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And thus we have We Own This City, a six-episode series premiering on HBO on Monday, April 25.
According to CBS Baltimore, eight officers of the Baltimore Police Department’s now-disbanded Gun Trace Task Force have been convicted of racketeering, armed robbery, selling drugs, making false overtime claims, and planting evidence on suspects.
In January, former Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Bromwich and other independent investigators released a 515-page report covering 20 years of history around the Gun Trace Task Force scandal.
“On the surface, this is about the [rise and fall] of the Baltimore Gun Trace Task Force,” Pelecanos previously told TV Insider.
The story and the players are real.”We Own This City, Series Premiere, Monday, April 25, 9/8c, HBO

LEILA FADEL, HOST:HBO's limited series "We Own This City" debuts tonight.
NPR TV critic Eric Deggans talked about the project with two executive producers who first teamed up on another landmark HBO series about policing in Baltimore.
And if you're getting good cases, if you're getting drugs and guns, you're bringing in shooters, then you can't lose.
DEGGANS: Much of this was foreshadowed in the series Simon and Pelecanos worked on in the mid-2000s, "The Wire."

     The True Story Behind 'We Own This City'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We Own This City, an HBO Max miniseries out April 25, about a Baltimore Police Department (BPD) task force unit that went rogue, highlights some of the biggest concerns with modern policing in America.
Adapted from former Baltimore Sun reporter Justin Fenton’s 2021 book We Own This City: A True Story of Crime, Cops, and Corruption, the show chronicles the rise and fall of one of the most shocking instances of police corruption in Baltimore’s history.
How the GTTF terrorized the city of BaltimoreThe wide array of crimes the GTTF’s officers engaged in is staggering.
When they found out that the couple had $40,000 in a house outside the city, they went to the house and took $20,000.
Some GTTF officers admitted in court that they would drive fast toward groups of people in the street and slam on the breaks.

     We Own This City Series-Premiere Recap: Uprising
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Real accountability is vanishingly rare — so rare, in fact, that when Jenkins is arrested by the FBI at the end of this first episode of We Own This City, he’s utterly flummoxed by it.
And he’s a cock-of-the-walk on the job, too, glad-handing his way through the office and riling up his guys on the street.
The worst of the worst is Daniel Hersl, who Josh Charles plays as the very definition of a racist thug hiding behind a badge.
The connecting thread is that Hersl doesn’t like “back talk” from the Black men he lives to brutalize and humiliate.
Burners• Fascinating political context regarding the Office of Civil Rights, which tends to go dormant when a Republican wins the White House.
