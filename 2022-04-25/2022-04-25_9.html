     Cincinnati Bengals 7-round 2022 NFL mock draft: Final edition
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We’ve made it to draft week after what feels like forever since this whole process started.
Let’s run through one more seven-round mock Cincinnati Bengals before we finally get to the actual draft, using The Draft Network’s simulator.
Those Bengals enter the draft with notable needs at one offensive line position, as well as defensive spots like cornerback, defensive tackle and in terms of pressure-creators.
A final seven-round mock will try to marry those needs with value and with prospects that fit the profile the Bengals like to take.
The goal is to provide a good idea of what might unfold this week during the three-day affair.

     Summary: It’s officially NFL draft week, which means it’s time for an updated look at how this year’s first round could shake out.
In reality, no first round is complete without a few surprises and a handful of trades, so that’s what you’ll find in our latest projection.
Who will be the first quarterback off the board, and how long will he have to wait?
Which top prospects will unexpectedly slide down the board?

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: My first NFL Draft mock draft of the season, and the board is full of surprises.
The amount of EDGE, OT, WR, and IDL who have top-15 talent pushes the board in odd ways.
This year, the NFL Draft will be full of excitement, intrigue, delight, and utter disappointment for many fans.
With just a few more days before the NFL Draft, this is my final NFL mock draft, unless trades come up.
Jets- Garrett Wilson, WR, Ohio StateZach Wilson can’t get any better if they cant fill out the team with talent.

     Summary: As we enter the week of the NFL Draft, we bring you our final Mock Draft ahead of the 2022 NFL Draft, this time a full seven-round mock draft, Dawg version.
For the third consecutive year, the University of Georgia will be shattering its own NFL Draft record.
After having sent 7 players to the NFL in 2020 and 8 players to the draft in 2021, Georgia could have as many as 14 players drafted in this week's 2022 NFL Draft.

Rodgers is locked up for several more years in Green Bay, and he likely will need wide receiver help quickly.

     Summary: The presence of a capable starter in Jared Goff makes a QB selection here even more likely, at least in my eyes.
Goff can be the bridge that allows a developmental process for a young QB.
Plus, you get the extra season of cost control with the fifth-year option.
Howell feels like Dan Campbell's kind of quarterback.
It was easy to see his toughness when you watched him pinball off would-be tacklers in the run game this past season, especially against Miami.

     Summary: A popular pick and Eagles trade-down in latest mock draft roundup originally appeared on NBC Sports PhiladelphiaWe finally made it.
There seems to be a good shot he won’t be available when the Eagles are on the clock, but if he is, the Eagles really should be interested.
The Johnson pick wouldn’t be a very popular pick.
When mock draft season really got underway, some of the offensive linemen were being mocked to the Eagles because of Brandon Brooks’ retirement.
Yeah, this is probably pretty early for the Eagles to draft a tight end but it’s an underrated position of need.

     Summary: One thing that's a constant every year, and should hold true again in 2022, is NFL teams will reach for quarterbacks.
With the 1st pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, the Jacksonville Jaguars select:Jacksonville - Evan Neal, OL, AlabamaTrevor Lawrence had a nightmare rookie season.
Another 1% is a lack of weapons and the last 1% is a terrible offensive line.
New York Giants - Ahmad Gardner, CB, CincinnatiYes, they need offensive line help.
Christian McCaffrey is expected to be healthy again in 2022 and keeping him that way should be priority #1 until they sort out the QB position.
