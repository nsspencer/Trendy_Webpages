     Erik Spoelstra explains in what way Jimmy Butler is ‘extremely underrated’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra believes that Jimmy Butler is “extremely underrated” in road playoff games due to his ability to stay calm under pressure.
“In these settings on the road, I think he’s extremely underrated because he’s very steady under the pressure and that just gives your team a lot of confidence,” Spoelstra said.
The Heat’s victory on Sunday came in a 110-86 blowout, with Butler leading the way.
Butler’s leadership has sometimes rubbed his teammates the wrong way, with the Heat being his fourth different team since entering the NBA.
Yet, there’s no sign that his Heat teammates have a problem with his approach.

     Miami Heat: Victor Oladipo And Jimmy Butler Laugh At Skip Bayless ‘Report’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If there’s one thing that is true about that Miami Heat locker room, it’s that everyone is willing to say what’s on their minds and get past it.
Not only did we see Victor Oladipo touch the floor, but we saw him connect with Jimmy Butler on the defensive end, sparking a second-quarter run that the Hawks just couldn’t answer.
The Miami Heat are thriving after another blowout in Game 4 of their series against Atlanta to go up 3-1.
As Jimmy Butler walked into the postgame press room, Victor Oladipo joked about @RealSkipBayless's comment last week that Butler doesn't want to play with Oladipo.
The Miami Heat head into Tuesday’s Game 5 up 3-1, with a chance to close it out on their home floor.

     Summary: He’s a former basketball player himself, who still studies the game like he was playing.
He has a deep connection to his oldest son.
And he’d never experienced Tyler quite like he was in 2020-21, when rumors swirled of a potential trade that would’ve sent Herro to the Houston Rockets as part of a package for James Harden.
“That’s where he started losing some of his confidence and wondering, ‘What am I doing wrong?
I think he felt some people went bad on him, so he kind of stayed away.” -via ESPN / April 22, 2022

     Summary: NBA Jimmy Butler Is More Versatile Than Ever FacebookTwitterEmailLinkJimmy Butler is dunking regularly against the Atlanta Hawks.
Michael Reaves / Getty ImagesAs NBA players age and their bodies and athletic capabilities change, the best players adapt their approaches to remain the best.
Such is the case with Jimmy Butler, whose Miami Heat are leading the Atlanta Hawks 3-1 in the first round of the playoffs.
Despite finding so much success as a big this season, Butler remains an effective ball-dominant initiator.
If Butler plays offense like a combination of a guard and a big, he’s no less versatile on defense.
