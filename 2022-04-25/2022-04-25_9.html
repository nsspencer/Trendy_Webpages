     U.S. Holds Sanctions on Rumored Putin ‘Mistress’ Kabaeva – WSJ
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The United States halted planned sanctions against President Vladimir Putin’s rumored “mistress,” former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, at the last minute, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.
Unnamed U.S. officials told the newspaper that a classified intelligence report made while investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections singled out Kabaeva as a beneficiary of Putin’s personal wealth.
They believed that imposing sanctions on Kabaeva would be deemed a personal blow to Putin, hampering efforts to negotiate peace, the officials told WSJ.
The Kremlin has long denied any relationship between Putin and Kabaeva, while news articles on their rumored engagement have been quickly punished by Russian censors.
Swiss, U.S. and European officials told the Wall Street Journal that Kabaeva traveled to Switzerland to give birth to Putin’s child in 2015.

     Did fear of Putin reprisals force US to cancel sanctions on Alina Kabaeva? The TRUTH behind rumors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A new report claims that the US purposefully avoided sanctioning Vladimir Putin's alleged mistress Alina Kabaeva at the eleventh hour, fearing that doing so would negatively impact relations with Russia.
Alina Kabaeva, 39, is a former Olympic rhythmic gymnastics champion, Russian Vogue cover model, and believed to be 70-year-old Putin's mistress.
It was pulled down a few days later when Putin denied the report.
This made her a perfect target for US sanctions after Putin invaded Ukraine in February.
Gold medal winner Alina Kabaeva of Russia acknowledges her support during the medal ceremony for rhythmic gymnastics on August 29, 2004, during the Athens 2004 Summer Olympic Games at the Galatsi Olympic Hall in Athens, Greece.
