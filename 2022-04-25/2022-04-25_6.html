     Grayson Allen‚Äôs honest take might make Bulls fans hate him even more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Many are still absolutely angry at him after he injured Chicago Bulls guard Alex Caruso last January.
But it has become clear that the Milwaukee Bucks guard isn‚Äôt fazed at all.
He was heavily booed by the fans of the Bulls throughout the game, but he has learned to tune them out.
The Bucks jeer Allen as well during practices and film sessions or when they‚Äôre on the bus or in a hotel.
Allen knows he‚Äôs considered a villain in the NBA, and he fires back by helping the Bucks win.

     Summary: It should warm the hearts of the Bulls and their fan base to hear about Grayson Allen‚Äôs tough week.
The Bucks‚Äô reserve guard was booed unmercifully in Games 3 and 4 at the United Center.
His one-game suspension for the flagrant-2 foul that fractured the right wrist of Bulls guard Alex Caruso was the low, but what he‚Äôs experiencing right now has definitely been the high.
It‚Äôs been the role players that have led to back-to-back Bucks blowouts, with Allen the face of that bench group.
NOTE: According to Bulls coach Billy Donovan, Caruso remained in the concussion protocol going through further testing on Monday, and was day-to-day for Wednesday‚Äôs Game 5.

     Summary: Grayson Allen beginning to win over Wisconsin basketball fansMILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- Grayson Allen and Wisconsin basketball fans have a unique relationship.
Allen's teammate and the two-time NBA MVP joked after Sunday's win that maybe the boos from the team and fans are helping Allen.
Several Bucks fans say they haven't forgotten what Allen did to the Badgers back in 2015.
"I hated Grayson Allen back then," said Bucks fan Deontre Jones, referring to Allen's time at Duke.
"Once he put on the Bucks jersey I was like, 'Well, I guess I'm a Grayson Allen guy now.'"

     Summary: Some Bucks fans still held out from praising the newcomer Allen, but as we moved into 2022, those opinions grew fainter.
Game 1 was an uninspiring victory that didn‚Äôt leave a great taste in the mouths of Bucks fans.
Among Bucks fans and national media voices alike, the conversation after the result of the first two games was grim.
Gianns and company built serious character during those series and if there‚Äôs anyone who shouldn‚Äôt discount this, it‚Äôs Bucks fans.
Of course, they had generational star, but so does this Bucks team.
