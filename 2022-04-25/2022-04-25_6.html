     Summary: TOKYO, April 25 (Reuters) - A Japanese woman believed to have been the world's oldest person has died aged 119, public broadcaster NHK said on Monday, reporting the death of Kane Tanaka.
Born on Jan. 2, 1903 - the year of the Wright Brothers' first controlled flight of their motor-driven airplane - Tanaka was confirmed by Guinness World Records in 2019 as the oldest living person.

     Summary: (Gray News) - Kane Tanaka, the world’s oldest person, has died in Japan at age 119, officials said.

At age 19, Tanaka married a rice shop owner and worked in the store until she was 103, CNN said.

     Summary: The world's oldest person, Japan's Kane Tanaka, dies at age 119Enlarge this image toggle caption Kyodo/Reuters Kyodo/ReutersAlthough she didn't quite make it to her goal of 120 years old, Kane Tanaka still lived long enough to become the world's oldest person — a title she held for the past three years, and attributed to family, sleep, hope and faith.
Tanaka died last week at 119, Japanese authorities announced.
During a 2019 presentation ceremony to celebrate her being the oldest person alive, she was given a box of chocolates — which she immediately opened and began devouring.
Earlier this month, Tanaka surpassed Sarah Knauss of the U.S. to become the second-longest lived person in recorded history.
The oldest currently living person is now said to be Lucile Randon, a 118-year-old French nun.

     Summary: Editor's Note, April 25, 2022: Kane Tanaka, the world's oldest person, died on April 18 at age 119.
According to a statement from Guinness World Records, Tanaka—both the oldest living person and the world's oldest living woman—had been "hospitalized and discharged repeatedly" in recent weeks but remained in good spirits.
Since turning 100, holding the record for the world’s oldest person has been Tanaka’s dream, according to Lateshia Beachum of the Washington Post.
Japan, for instance, boasts the world’s oldest population, with more than 71,000 centenarians.
Last year, when Tanaka received her record for the world’s oldest person, she was asked about the happiest moment in her long life.
