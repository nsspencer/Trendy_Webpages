     Bucks' Grayson Allen continues to torment Bulls in NBA Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grayson Allen changed the course of the Chicago Bulls' season on Jan. 21, when, with a flagrant foul, he fractured Alex Caruso's right wrist.
And Allen is doing so in the face of vociferous boos from the United Center crowd, which will forever harbor ill will in his direction.
The Milwaukee Bucks can't beat us.
But Allen is doing particularly explosive damage, and worse, has become a rallying cry of the opponent.
About to watch film, boo," Allen said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grayson Allen stays hot with 27 points and six 3-pointers in the Bucks' Game 4 victory over the Bulls.
(1:10)CHICAGO -- In the days leading up to the team's first road playoff games in Chicago, the Milwaukee Bucks used every opportunity they could to shower Grayson Allen with boos.
So when Allen set back-to-back playoff career highs in Games 3 and 4 this weekend to help Milwaukee take a commanding 3-1 series lead over Chicago, the Bucks bench enjoyed booing him all the way.
Even if he has gained a reputation as a villain in Chicago, Allen insisted after the game Sunday that he does not feed off such a negative reaction.
After leading all scorers in Game 3 on Friday with 22 points, Allen was even better on Sunday afternoon.

     Summary: CHICAGO – Grayson Allen will have to accept the boos in Chicago forever.
Which probably drowned out a real “(Bleep) you, Grayson Allen” from a fan behind the Bucks basket at the end of the game.
“I think that’s his comfort zone, I think that’s what he’s used to, right?” said Bucks center Brook Lopez of the Bucks boos.
The ultimate joy out there for me is just playing, have fun, play free.
I’m not going out searching for it, like, oh I love this…”And yet where would the Bucks be right now without Allen?

     Grayson Allen Kicked Over The Lantern: The Bucks Are Back (But Never Left)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Some Bucks fans still held out from praising the newcomer Allen, but as we moved into 2022, those opinions grew fainter.
Game 1 was an uninspiring victory that didn’t leave a great taste in the mouths of Bucks fans.
Among Bucks fans and national media voices alike, the conversation after the result of the first two games was grim.
Gianns and company built serious character during those series and if there’s anyone who shouldn’t discount this, it’s Bucks fans.
Of course, they had generational star, but so does this Bucks team.
