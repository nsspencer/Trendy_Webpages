     Melissa Lucio - latest: Attorneys make last-ditch bid with DA to stop execution as parole board mulls clemency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lucio’s attorneys filed a supplement to a previous motion on Monday asking the DA to withdraw the order setting her execution date for Wednesday at 6pm CT.
Mr Saenz said that if Lucio “does not get a stay by a certain day, then I will do what I have to do and stop it”.
The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles is also meeting to decide whether to recommend Lucio’s death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment or that she be granted a 120-day execution reprieve.
Lucio was sentenced to death for the 2007 murder of her two-year-old daughter Mariah.
Her lawyers say she was coerced into a false confession during an aggressive police interrogation and that scientific evidence shows she died from a fall.

     Melissa Lucio faces execution this week in Texas. Here’s what to know about her case
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In this undated photograph, Texas death row inmate Melissa Lucio is holding her daughter Mariah, while one of her other daughters, Adriana, stands next to them.
Prosecutors say Lucio fatally beat her 2-year-old daughter but Lucio has long denied that, saying Mariah died from injuries sustained during a fall down a flight of stairs.
Her lawyers say Lucio's history of sexual and physical abuse led to her giving an unreliable confession.
They say Lucio wasn’t allowed to present evidence questioning the validity of her confession.
Prosecutors say Lucio had a history of drug abuse and at times had lost custody of some of her 14 children.
