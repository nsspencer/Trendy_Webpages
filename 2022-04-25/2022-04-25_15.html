     Sanctioning Putin's rumored girlfriend Alina Kabaeva would deal a heavy blow to the Russian leader: Expert
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sanctioning Russian President Vladimir Putin's rumored girlfriend, Alina Kabaeva, would deal a heavy blow to the Russian leader and should be considered as the U.S. continues to weigh responses to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, Russian-born former U.S. intelligence officer Rebekah Koffler said on "Jesse Watters Primetime."
U.S. officials reportedly decided against sanctioning the 38-year-old Russian gymnast and Olympic gold medalist Kabaeva citing concerns that it was too drastic, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.
"Unfortunately, she is not capable of stopping Putin from waging war on Ukraine.
Koffler said the reasoning for U.S. officials not to sanction Kabaeva – who is believed to be the mother of at least three of Putin's children – makes "no sense."
Putin is portraying himself as the victim, so not sanctioning [Kabaeva] makes no sense."

     Summary: U.S. officials held off on imposing sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's rumored girlfriend, 38-year-old gymnast and Olympic gold medalist Alina Kabaeva, as the measure was seen as too drastic, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
The newspaper cited unnamed officials as saying the 2016 investigation into Russia's interference in U.S. presidential elections revealed that Kabaeva had benefited from Putin's influence and personal wealth.
In this November 4, 2004 file photo, Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks with gymnast Alina Kabaeva at a Kremlin banquet in Moscow, Russia.
