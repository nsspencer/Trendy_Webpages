    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is the first draft in recent memory where there isn’t a consensus number one overall prospect.
There are still guys rising and falling as each day passes.
In my first and only mock, I’ve looked at the value that each player adds to the team making the pick.
There are only a few teams that are in a rebuild, this means that teams may not go with best available, but rather guys that help them win now.
That being said, there won’t be any trades in this mock draft.

     Eagles, NFL mock draft roundup: What the experts are saying
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here are a few theories as we near the NFL Draft and final decisions on what the Eagles decide to do.
Here’s what the experts believe the Eagles will do with those first-round selections once the NFL Draft gets underway.
As you know, they haven’t taken a linebacker in the first round of any NFL Draft since 1979 when Jerry Robinson was the selection out of UCLA.
Sports Illustrated’s Conor Orr sends cornerback Derek Stingley and wide receiver Jameson Williams to Philadelphia at 15 and 18.

     Summary: As we enter the week of the NFL Draft, we bring you our final Mock Draft ahead of the 2022 NFL Draft, this time a full seven-round mock draft, Dawg version.
For the third consecutive year, the University of Georgia will be shattering its own NFL Draft record.
After having sent 7 players to the NFL in 2020 and 8 players to the draft in 2021, Georgia could have as many as 14 players drafted in this week's 2022 NFL Draft.
1 Jacksonville Jaguars - DE, Travon WalkerThere's a theory running around the league that if Aidan Hutchinson were truly the No.
Rodgers is locked up for several more years in Green Bay, and he likely will need wide receiver help quickly.

     Rhett Lewis 2022 NFL mock draft 1.0: Pass rushers fly off the board; Jets grab a wide receiver at No. 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The presence of a capable starter in Jared Goff makes a QB selection here even more likely, at least in my eyes.
Goff can be the bridge that allows a developmental process for a young QB.
Plus, you get the extra season of cost control with the fifth-year option.
Howell feels like Dan Campbell's kind of quarterback.
It was easy to see his toughness when you watched him pinball off would-be tacklers in the run game this past season, especially against Miami.
