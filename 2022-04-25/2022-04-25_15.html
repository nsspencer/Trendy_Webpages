     Flash flooding possible in Houston Monday as severe storms threaten 2 inches of rain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A sunny start to the week in Houston will be dashed by showers Monday afternoon, some of which could bring heavy rainfall and potentially severe storms through the evening.
Here's where NWS meteorologists think the most rain will fall:Much of the area will see rainfall totals between 0.5 to 2 inches, but meteorologists also say some areas could see 3 to 4 inches.
The storms have already brought record-breaking rainfall to College Station, where rain gauges recorded 2.04 inches so far today—surpassing the daily record 2.03 inches the city received on April 25, 1948.
After the front moves through, Houston has mostly sunny skies and warm temperatures in the forecast for the rest of the week.
Houston will be in the mid-80s during the day and mid- to upper-60s during the night until at least Sunday.
