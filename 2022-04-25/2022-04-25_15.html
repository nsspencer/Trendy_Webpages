Mr. King testified that he found Mr. Depp’s fingertip in a “scrunched up” piece of paper amid the wreckage.

     Johnny Depp And Amber Heard’s Trial Takes A Turn For The Surreal
    </h2>

     Summary: Johnny Depp and Amber Heard attend a premiere for 'Black Mass' during the 72nd Venice Film Festival ... [+] at on September 4, 2015 in Venice, Italy.
(Photo by Tristan Fewings/Getty Images) Getty ImagesJohnny Depp’s defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard has taken a surreal turn, as makeup brand Milani took to TikTok to turn footage of the trial into content, an advertisement masquerading as an “epic clapback” that has been viewed at least 4.6 million times.
In the TikTok clip, Milani pushes back against a claim made by one of Amber Heard's lawyers, that Heard used one of the company's concealers to cover up bruises during her abusive marriage to Johnny Depp.
Footage of the trial has been live-streaming on various platforms since April 11, like a star-studded episode of Judge Judy, with multiple celebrities dragged into the mess.
Nothing, it seems, is off-limits; everything is content, and content can be used to push merchandise, even if said merchandise is associated with a domestic abuse case.
