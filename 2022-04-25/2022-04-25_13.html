    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Watch Hayley Williams Sing Paramore’s “Misery Business” with Billie Eilish at Weekend 2 of CoachellaFor each of the past two weekends, Billie Eilish delivered powerhouse headlining performances at the Coachella Valley Music &amp; Arts Festival, taking the main stage each Saturday night with her brother/collaborator FINNEAS for lengthy sets of her hits and fan favorites.

As for Eilish and her Coachella surprises: Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz was Eilish’s guest in the first weekend’s performance.
For this Coachella one-off, Williams shared a behind-the-scenes video of how she obtained her look for the performance using her own brand, Good Dye Young.
