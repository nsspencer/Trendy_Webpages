     Melissa Lucio: Texas death row mother to learn of fate today as parole board considers clemency
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If the board does not recommend the execution be stopped, the Republican governor only has the power to issue a 30-day stay of execution.
Mr Abbott has only ever granted clemency to one person on death row since taking office back in 2015.
I still have not received a report from the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles,” he said.
There are a handful of other options to save Lucio’s life if the parole board and the governor do not grant her clemency.
Lucio’s legal team has filed an appeal with the Texas Texas Court of Criminal Appeals asking it to grant her a stay of execution.
