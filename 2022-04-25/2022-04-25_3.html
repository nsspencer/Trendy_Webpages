     Celtics Eliminate Nets’ Latest Superteam With First-Round Sweep
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The basketball zings from player to player when the Celtics run their offense, and it found Grant Williams as the first half was winding down in Game 4 of Boston’s first-round playoff series against the Nets on Monday night at Barclays Center.
Williams had oodles of space to line up his 3-pointer, which he swished.
The Nets still had time for one last heave before halftime, and the inbounds pass went to Kyrie Irving with 2.1 seconds remaining.
But rather than launch a shot from beyond half-court, he simply dropped the ball for a referee to retrieve as time elapsed.
Sure enough, as the second half played out, the Nets ran out of chances.

     Summary: The Boston Celtics drew the short straw and had to face the team nobody wanted in the East’s first round: The Brooklyn Nets.
The Celtics swept the Nets out of the playoffs.
Ime Udoka on the Celtics not avoiding the Nets before the start of the playoffs: "We said we're not scared of anybody and we're not running for anybody."
It was all too much for a Nets team that proved to be too top-heavy, not big or athletic enough, and lacked chemistry.
How do the Nets get younger, more athletic, and more defensive with the players around Durant and Irving?

     Summary: Jayson Tatum puts up 29 points in the Celtics' Game 4 win vs. the Nets for a first-round sweep.
He disagreed with his sixth foul but had no doubt the Boston Celtics, with their rock-solid defense, would hold on without their scoring star.
Tatum scored 29 points, Jaylen Brown had 22 and the Celtics completed a four-game sweep of the Brooklyn Nets, becoming the first team to reach the second round of the playoffs with a 116-112 victory Monday night.
Tatum had 12 points in the third quarter and the Celtics opened a 90-75 lead in the closing seconds of the period.

     Summary: With the 2021-22 NBA regular season now in the books, the basketball betting market is hotter than ever.
Sam Quinn will make at least one pick for every game between now and the NBA Finals.
If a team tells you that it's given up on a series… it's probably given up on a series.
The Nets think they're going to lose, and as such, they're holding Simmons back to give him a debut with less pressure next season.
The series is more conducive to offense in Philadelphia than Toronto if you believe in the concept of the home whistle.

Give Brooklyn credit: Down 3–0, the Nets played like a team that wanted another trip to Boston.
Boston played 15 games in December.
Udoka likened the Smart experience to Popovich’s with Manu Ginobili, a free-wheeling guard who played a key role in four Spurs championships.
I do feel like I'm one of the best players.”Jaylen Brown, who battled injuries and COVID issues early in the season, played like an All-Star in the second half.

     Summary: The Nets have a point differential of minus-4.7 points per game, better than that of the 2-2 Minnesota Timberwolves and four teams currently down 3-1.
But every other team has won at least one game, while the Nets are in serious danger of being swept, facing elimination in Game 4 on Monday (7 ET, TNT).
Despite that and the inevitability of a 3-0 series, there are a few intriguing things to keep an eye on in Game 4.
He made it clear after Game 3 that he’s been “thinking too much” about how to attack the Celtics’ defense.
Drummond has started all 28 games he’s played for the Nets, but his minutes have not been good in this series.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Celtics have clinched their spot in the Eastern Conference semifinals after their 116-112 win over the Brooklyn Nets in Game 4 of their best-of-seven series.
Jayson Tatum was fantastic for Boston finishing the win with 29 points, five assists and three rebounds to lead the way for the Celtics.
If anything, sweeping this specific Nets team in four close games is perhaps even more impressive than doing it in four blowouts.
But what they did to a Nets team that was far better than it had any right to be considering its injuries was one of the more impressive feats we'll see this postseason.
He played 18 minutes in Game 4 and the Nets won those minutes by 10 points.
