According to Rolling Stone, DaBaby described that attack as trying to “get the jump on” the pair when quizzed by police.

“Daughter could have got hit, son could have got hit [and] me,” the rapper said in an Instagram video soon after the shooting.
According to Rolling Stone, the rapper has also been linked to a non-fatal shooting in his home, which reportedly took place on April 13.
11 weeks after the incident, DaBaby signed with Interscope Records.

     Previously Unreleased Video Casts Doubt On DaBaby's Self-Defense Claim In 2018 Walmart Murder
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Charlotte, NC – DaBaby was on the verge of superstardom when he was cleared in the November 2018 murder of Jaylin Craig.
The KIRK rapper claimed he shot the 19-year-old North Carolina native in self-defense after a chance encounter at a Charlotte-area Walmart.
But in newly obtained video by Rolling Stone, DaBaby’s self-defense claim appears to be called into question.
Craig thought he saw DaBaby in the store but was thrown off by his subdued clothing and the fact he was shopping for baby clothes in a Walmart.
While Douglas says he never saw Craig draw a weapon, DaBaby told police they saw Craig pull a gun out he was fighting with Douglas.
