     Large fire at oil depot in Russia's Bryansk, near Ukraine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: -A large fire broke out early on Monday at an oil storage facility in the Russian city of Bryansk, the emergencies ministry said, adding that no one was injured.
There was no immediate indication the fire was related to the war in Ukraine, although Russian officials said last week that Ukrainian helicopters hit residential buildings and injured seven people in the area.
In a statement, the ministry said the fire took place at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 2 a.m. Moscow time (2300 GMT), and there had been no need to evacuate any parts of the city of 400,000 people.
Bryansk is an administrative centre 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the Ukrainian border, near the Sumy and Chernihiv regions, and is about 380 km (236 miles) distant from Moscow, the Russian capital.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine, now entering their third month, a special military operation.

     Large fires break out at Russian oil depots
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Large fires broke out early on Monday at two oil depots in the Russian city of Bryansk, less than 100 miles from the border with Ukraine, in a potential act of sabotage by Kyiv.
Bryansk, which is less than 100 miles north-east of the Ukrainian border, serves as a logistics base for Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine.
Images posted on Russian social media showed columns of smoke rising from the facilities in the Russian city on Monday morning.
Military analyst Rob Lee said that the footage suggested the fire was “probably” caused by Ukrainian sabotage.
According to Baza, a Telegram news channel with links to Russian security services, the fires were caused by Ukrainian drones.

     Bryansk fire: Oil depot blaze breaks out in Russian city where Kremlin accused Ukraine of helicopter strikes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A huge fire erupted at an oil depot in Russia after explosions rocked the city of Bryansk.
Although the cause of the fires has not been confirmed, Bryansk is a key transit point for Russian military troops heading to Ukraine.
No link to the war in Ukraine has yet been established but Russia has accused Ukraine of targeting the city with helicopter strikes just last week.
It comes after Russian officials accused Ukraine of using helicopters to hit residential buildings and injured seven people in the area last week.
It was the first time that Russia had accused Ukraine of launching an air strike on its territory since Moscow invaded its neighbour on 24 February.
