     Kyle Schwarber, like all of us, finally had enough of Angel Hernandez's s---
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It took Hernandez just five short days to remind us that ... yup, he still stinks at his job.
Per the Umpire Auditor, a Twitter account with over 60,000 followers that keeps track of every bad call on a given day in baseball, Hernandez, who was behind the plate for the Philadelphia Philles vs. Milwaukee Brewers game on Sunday Night Baseball, was the lowest-rated umpire of the day.
Keep in mind, it's a bit of an arbitrary "rating" since there is no set strike zone every single game and there is still a human element to umping.
Still, no one is going to disagree when it calls out Hernandez's performance.

     MLB makes right call in Kyle Schwarber-Angel Hernandez incident
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Apr 24, 2022; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies designated hitter Kyle Schwarber (12) argues with umpire Angel Hernandez after being called out on strikes during the ninth inning against the Milwaukee Brewers at Citizens Bank Park.
Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY SportsKyle Schwarber erupted on umpire Angel Hernandez on Sunday night in a Phillies loss to the Brewers but MLB made the right call about a punishment.
Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Kyle Schwarber lived out the likely dream of every MLB player in the modern era on Sunday night.
Umpire Angel Hernandez, perhaps the most infamous ump in baseball, was behind the plate for the Sunday Night Baseball matchup against the Milwaukee Brewers.
Schwarber exploded on Hernandez in a hilarious yet appropriate display that saw him ejected.

     Former Cubs star Kyle Schwarber goes off on an umpire
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Everyone knows that Angel Hernandez is an extremely bad umpire.
He has ejected many people for arguing with his ignorant calls but Kyle Schwarber finally lost it.
In the bottom of the ninth inning down 1-0, the Philadelphia Phillies were looking to tie the Milwaukee Brewers.
Somehow, Angel Hernandez called it a strike, and Schwarber was out.
He is right and Angel Hernandez has probably since seen that the call was brutal.

     Summary: While Schwarber slammed down his bat and batting helmet and hurled expletives at Hernandez, the oft-criticized umpire had it coming after a long night of bad calls.
No word on Hernandez, though past precedent suggests he won’t face any consequences for being bad at his job.
In the most heightened cases, umpires can make or break a game, as evidenced on Sunday night.
No one wants you behind the plate anymore.”In response, the Major League Baseball Umpires Association didn’t even try to hide its fragility on Twitter.
— Major League Baseball Umpires Association (@MLBUA) August 17, 2017The umpire’s job is to keep the game in line, but there’s basically no overhead to keep them in line.

     WATCH: Phillies' Kyle Schwarber loses his mind, is ejected after bad third-strike call by Angel Hernandez
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Our champion here would be Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber.
Background: Both sides were unhappy with Hernandez due to his, um, we'll say inconsistent strike zone throughout the game that aired nationally as ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball.
Schwarber himself was rung up on a pitch outside the zone in his previous at-bat, so there was plenty of baggage here.
Schwarber correctly goes to take his base, but he's rung up by Hernandez.
The only let down was Phillies manager Joe Girardi being so subdued, though he did say he was open to an automated strike zone after the game.

     Summary: Throughout the night, Hernandez drew the ire of both teams for his faulty strike zone.
Schwarber had been victimized by Hernandez' interpretation of the strike zone three innings earlier.
According to the data, Hernandez called a total of 10 strikes on Phillies hitters that were out of the zone.
That's why I'm kind of for the automated strike zone.
Schwarber does not favor an automated strike zone.
