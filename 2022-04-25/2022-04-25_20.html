     Erik Spoelstra explains in what way Jimmy Butler is ‘extremely underrated’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra believes that Jimmy Butler is “extremely underrated” in road playoff games due to his ability to stay calm under pressure.
“In these settings on the road, I think he’s extremely underrated because he’s very steady under the pressure and that just gives your team a lot of confidence,” Spoelstra said.
The Heat’s victory on Sunday came in a 110-86 blowout, with Butler leading the way.
Butler’s leadership has sometimes rubbed his teammates the wrong way, with the Heat being his fourth different team since entering the NBA.
Yet, there’s no sign that his Heat teammates have a problem with his approach.

     Summary: ATLANTA (AP) — Miami used team defense to smother Atlanta’s Trae Young and then leaned on Jimmy Butler to take the scoring lead.
Butler scored 13 of his 36 points in a dominant second quarter and the Heat beat the Hawks 110-86 while again shutting down Young on Sunday night to take a 3-1 series lead.
Young scored only nine points with five assists and five turnovers as he was shut down by Miami’s defense for the second time in four games.
The Hawks led 37-29 before Miami took control with a 15-0 run in the second period.
A key in the Heat’s surge came on a Butler steal from Collins, who fouled as Butler scored and then made the free throw.

Butler delivered 36 points along with ten rebounds and four assists while Bam Adebayo had 14 points and eight rebounds.
Coach Erik Spoelstra was far from surprised and it seems everything in the game went according to the locker room plan.
“We have some gnarly competitors in our locker room that love big challenges,” Spoelstra said.
“Everybody to a man in that locker room knew that we couldn’t have a 15-20 turnover game.

Michael Reaves / Getty ImagesAs NBA players age and their bodies and athletic capabilities change, the best players adapt their approaches to remain the best.
Such is the case with Jimmy Butler, whose Miami Heat are leading the Atlanta Hawks 3-1 in the first round of the playoffs.
Despite finding so much success as a big this season, Butler remains an effective ball-dominant initiator.
If Butler plays offense like a combination of a guard and a big, he’s no less versatile on defense.

Making up for a rather forgettable choke job to conclude Game 3, a Kyle Lowry-less Miami squad played classic Heat playoff basketball for another chance to add to the #Heatin5 collection.
It felt like the Hawks were floating along before Miami’s inevitable progression to the mean.
