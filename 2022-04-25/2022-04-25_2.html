     Texas court grants stay of execution for death row inmate Melissa Lucio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Monday granted a stay of execution for Melissa Lucio, halting her execution scheduled for Wednesday and sending her case back to the trial court to review new evidence.
Lucio, her family, advocates and attorneys say she was wrongfully convicted of capital murder in the 2007 death of her toddler Mariah.
At trial, prosecutors argued Lucio was an abusive mother who likely caused the injuries that brought about her daughter's death.
Of the nine claims Lucio raised in her habeas application, the appellate court ordered the trial court to consider four of them, including her assertions she is innocent and new scientific evidence precludes her conviction.
Lucio also argued the state relied on false testimony and suppressed evidence favorable to her defense.
