     Twitter Nears a Deal to Sell Itself to Elon Musk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Twitter is nearing a deal to sell itself to Elon Musk, two people with knowledge of the situation said, a move that would unite the world’s richest man with the influential social networking service.
An agreement could be announced as soon as Monday, the people said.
The discussions followed a Twitter board meeting on Sunday morning to discuss Mr. Musk’s offer, the people said.
An agreement is not yet final and may still fall apart, but what had initially seemed to be a highly improbable deal appeared to be nearing an endgame.
The situation involving Twitter and Mr. Musk remains fluid and fast-moving, the people with knowledge of the situation said.

The billionaire Elon Musk bought 9% of Twitter, an investment of USD 3 billion.
Twitter shares jumped more than 3% on reports the company is nearing a deal with Elon Musk that could be announced as soon as Monday.
