     Summary: Texas court orders a stay of execution for Melissa Lucio to review the caseEnlarge this image toggle caption AP APAn appeals court in Texas has halted the execution of Melissa Lucio, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, over questions about her innocence and concerns over the trial that led to her conviction.
The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas issued a stay of execution Monday and sent that case back to a lower court for review, a decision that was met with praise by her attorneys, criminal justice advocates and Lucio herself.
"I am grateful the Court has given me the chance to live and prove my innocence," she said in a statement provided by her legal team.
Lucio was convicted 14 years ago of murdering her 2-year-old daughter, Mariah, and later sentenced to death.
Greg Abbott and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles asking them to grant her clemency, Houston Public Media reported.

     Summary: The Texas court of criminal appeals has issued a stay of execution for Melissa Lucio, the Mexican-American woman who was set to be judicially killed within 48 hours, ordering a lower court to consider new evidence of her innocence in the death of her two-year-old daughter Mariah.
