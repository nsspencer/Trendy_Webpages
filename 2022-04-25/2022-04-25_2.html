    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There’s very little you can do to earn an immediate – and I mean *IMMEDIATE* – ejection from a game, but Kyle Schwarber managed the feat tonight.
Schwarber was right to be pissed.
Oh, maybe, maybe not.
But apparently it was a cumulative thing throughout the game, as it, eh hem, sometimes is with Angel Hernandez.
The episode was reminiscent of an end-of-game Schwarber ejection back with the Cubs, where he was also understandably angry.

     Summary: In the bottom of the ninth inning, Hernández rung up outfielder Kyle Schwarber on a strike three call that appeared to be off the plate in a full count.
Kyle Schwarber — not a fan of this called third strike by Angel Hernandez.
ESPN's announcers had no grievance with Schwarber's tantrum, saying Schwarber was "speaking for both sides" on the broadcast.
Rather, as Schwarber indicates with his hands, Hernández had been woefully inconsistent no matter who was at the plate.
Schwarber had every intention of getting run out after that called strike three, and he made sure he got his money's worth.

     Summary: Kyle Schwarber did what plenty of other MLB players have likely thought of doing over the years on Sunday night.
The Phillies star went ballistic on home plate umpire Angel Hernandez after a questionable strikeout call in the ninth inning of a game that had a number of them — from an ump with a history of getting calls wrong.
Schwarber took a 3-2 sinker from Brewers closer Josh Hader that he thought was off the outside corner.
But it was called a strike by Hernandez for the second out of the inning in a game the host Phillies would lose 1-0.

     Summary: Angel Hernandez is one of the most infamous referees in the MLB… for all the wrong reasons.
Fans, players, and managers all take issue with his rather liberal strike zone judgment.
Kyle Schwarber and the Philadelphia Phillies got another taste of the Hernandez experience in their match against the Milwaukee Brewers.
The strike zone display showed it was out of the zone.
However, as Kyle Schwarber was walking to first base, Angel Hernandez called it a strike, angering the batter and getting ejected in the process.

     Summary: AP Photo/Matt SlocumKyle Schwarber might be counting down the days to the strike zone being enforced electronically if Sunday was any indication.
The only issue was the fact the 3-2 pitch was clearly out of the strike zone and should have resulted in a walk.
Instead, umpire Angel Hernandez called Schwarber out, which led to quite a response from the 29-year-old:"I'm not here to bury anyone, but it wasn't very good," Schwarber told reporters.
"ESPN's announcers had no grievance with Schwarber's tantrum, saying Schwarber was 'speaking for both sides' on the broadcast.
Schwarber's demonstration is yet another reason baseball fans will know Hernandez by name as his umpiring career continues.
