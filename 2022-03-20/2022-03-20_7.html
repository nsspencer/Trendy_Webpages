     Summary: Indeed, Riley was facing a situation he hadn’t been in in his 24 previous tour starts.
The former Alabama All-American whose career-best 62 on Saturday at the Copperhead Course vaulted him into a two-stroke lead over Matthew NeSmith, had never been better than T-15 entering the final round of a tournament so far in his young tour career.
That was at The American Express in January, and he wound up finishing T-59.
His best spot entering any round was a T-5 back in January.

     Brooks Koepka on final-round 65 at Valspar: 'Probably the worst score I could have shot'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Though it wasn't enough to leave Innisbrook with a win, Brooks Koepka shot a final-round 65 — his lowest Tour round since August — which vaulted him 33 spots up the leaderboard.
But Sunday's round at the Valspar Championship wasn't up to the four-time major champion's standards.
"To be honest with you, I thought it was probably the worst score I could have shot," Koepka, who finished T-12, said after his 6-under final round.
"It's been a trend, not getting the best out of my rounds, just kind of getting the worst out of 'em."
