Mark Konezny / USA TODAY SportsMusselman can give you a lot of information in one sentence at times, but the coaching staff had a game plan that shut down the Aggies' Teddy Allen.
Mark Konezny / USA TODAY SportsHe also got to put the cherry on top at the end of a win that needed something sweet on it late.
Mark Konezny / USA TODAY SportsThat usually makes games ugly.
Maybe a couple in the Lunatic Fringe will complain but it was Noland Richardson that pointed out a few decades ago that an ugly win beats a pretty loss every time.

     Summary: AUSTIN, Texas -- Mike Neighbors hinted at his excitement about the future of the University of Arkansas women's basketball program a couple of times recently, but he wasn't ready to turn the page on Friday evening.
Neighbors will take some time first to reflect on the season that included the program's first back-to-back NCAA Tournament berths since 2002-03.
This is still too much on these kids that are on this team," Neighbors said following the season-ending loss.
We all feel probably a little differently in different manners, but that's what makes a team sport a team sport.
I know they're going to be talking about things that have happened the last two, three days in time."

Razorbacks Play Role of SEC Basketball’s CusterWe know:The SEC has been a dud in this NCAA Tournament.
There’s nothing really for Arkansas to avoid here, but it’s fun to point out that Arkansas’ SEC rivals were all disappointments.
If the Hogs are hitting from deep and can spread out the Gonzaga defense, they’ll have a great shot.
