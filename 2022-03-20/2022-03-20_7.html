     Summary: Imagine if Memphis didn’t foul quite as much and had a bit higher talent level with the ability to last a full 40 minutes.
That’s Arkansas … to a point.
That’s not to say Memphis gave Arkansas the blueprint after getting out to a big lead on the Bulldogs, but the pressure and the style were a bother until the No.
To take this another way, Memphis looked and played like a fighter who punched himself out.

     Summary: "The way (Toney) played individually tonight was as good as any defender that I've ever coached," he said later in Buffalo, N.Y., after the Razorbacks' ugly 53-48 win over New Mexico State.
Mark Konezny / USA TODAY SportsMusselman can give you a lot of information in one sentence at times, but the coaching staff had a game plan that shut down the Aggies' Teddy Allen.
Mark Konezny / USA TODAY SportsHe also got to put the cherry on top at the end of a win that needed something sweet on it late.
Mark Konezny / USA TODAY SportsThat usually makes games ugly.
Maybe a couple in the Lunatic Fringe will complain but it was Noland Richardson that pointed out a few decades ago that an ugly win beats a pretty loss every time.

“We had a good time when we got back to the hotel with some of our fans and obviously the players,” Musselman said.
“We ate and started in on some Gonzaga film and carried that over into today’s breakfast, as well.
“Gonzaga is a great team,” Musselman said.
In addition to an early scout on Gonzaga, Musselman talked to the Razorbacks about cross-country travel, including how fairly rapid change in time zones can impact the body and mind.

     Summary: AUSTIN, Texas -- Mike Neighbors hinted at his excitement about the future of the University of Arkansas women's basketball program a couple of times recently, but he wasn't ready to turn the page on Friday evening.
Neighbors will take some time first to reflect on the season that included the program's first back-to-back NCAA Tournament berths since 2002-03.
This is still too much on these kids that are on this team," Neighbors said following the season-ending loss.
We all feel probably a little differently in different manners, but that's what makes a team sport a team sport.
I know they're going to be talking about things that have happened the last two, three days in time."

Razorbacks Play Role of SEC Basketball’s CusterWe know:The SEC has been a dud in this NCAA Tournament.
There’s nothing really for Arkansas to avoid here, but it’s fun to point out that Arkansas’ SEC rivals were all disappointments.
If the Hogs are hitting from deep and can spread out the Gonzaga defense, they’ll have a great shot.
