     Summary: Updated March 20, 2022 at 8:28 PM ETSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, 73, has been hospitalized with an infection since Friday and is expected to be released within the next couple of days, according to the court.
Thomas was admitted to Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., on Friday evening after experiencing "flu-like symptoms," the Supreme Court said in a statement on Sunday evening.
During his absence from Supreme Court proceedings, Justice Thomas will remain involved in the "consideration and discussion" of cases based on written materials and recordings of the oral arguments, the court said.
