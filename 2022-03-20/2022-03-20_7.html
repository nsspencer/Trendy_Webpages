     Philadelphia Flyers Recall Owen Tippett
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia Flyers announced that they have recalled forward Owen Tippett ahead of their game against the New York Islanders this afternoon.
Tippett will wear #74 and be available to play for the Flyers in today’s game.
As expected, the trade from Florida to Philadelphia should open some new horizons for Tippett, who has struggled to establish himself in the NHL.
Tippett does still have plenty of promise, headlined by an impressive 18 points in just 12 AHL games this season.
Now with the Flyers, Tippett could expect not only more ice-time, but more opportunities to play with the Flyers’ best players, and potentially even appear regularly on the team’s powerplay.

     Flyers scratch Justin Braun vs. Islanders, Owen Tippett to make debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia Flyers will hold Justin Braun out of the lineup for Sunday's game against the New York Islanders ahead of Monday's NHL trade deadline.
Newly acquired Owen Tippett is also set to make his debut for the Flyers playing on a line with Morgan Frost and Oskar Lindblom.
In 61 games this season, Braun has five goals and 16 points while averaging 20:02 of ice time this season.
Tippett was acquired on Saturday in a deal that sent the Flyers longtime captain Claude Giroux to the Florida Panthers.
I’m sure Philadelphia would like to see his game move to the middle of the ice, between the dots.

     Preview: Flyers welcome the Islanders as Owen Tippett makes Flyers debut
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Regardless, it will all begin Sunday afternoon when the New York Islanders visit the Wells Fargo Center for a matinee game.
The Islanders are 26-24-9 this season and have been well out of the playoffs for a majority of the season, much like the Flyers.
With that being said Owen Tippett is expected to be in the lineup, wearing #74, for the Flyers this afternoon, barring any issues.
Tippett has six goals and eight assist for 14 points in 42 NHL games this season.
As always with a Barry Trotz coached team the Islanders will be physical and tough to play against on the back end.

     Summary: Meet right winger Owen Tippett, the newest Flyer.
The Flyers sent Giroux, underachieving prospects German Rubtsov and Connor Bunnaman, along with a fifth-round pick in 2024, to Florida for Tippett, a No.
“I’m really excited for this new opportunity to join a team, build with them and get a fresh start,” Tippett said.
Last season, Tippett spent a lot of time on the second line.
Mike Yeo, the Flyers’ interim coach, liked what he saw from Tippett when he was with the Panthers.
