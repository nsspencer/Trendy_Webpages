     Twitter reacts to Notre Dame's NCAA Tournament loss to Texas Tech
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Notre Dame had the lead and the ball with just over 1:30 left in Sunday night’s NCAA Tournament Second Round game with Texas Tech, ultimately falling 59-53 and seeing their season come to an end.
It’s frustrating in that the game was winnable and a sour way to close what was an impressive turnaround for a Fighting Irish squad that was just 4-5 after falling to Indiana on December 18.
Texas Tech now advances to take on Duke in the Sweet 16 after the Blue Devils got by Michigan State in the Second Round.

     Texas Tech basketball: Gritty win leads Red Raiders to Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a team, Tech would go 13-14 at the line in the second 20 minutes after missing all three of their attempts in the first half.
And given how poorly the Red Raiders shot the ball on the night, they needed every point they could get at the line.
Leading Tech by doing the dirty work all night, Obanor paced Tech in scoring with 15 points and rebounding with 15 boards.
Meanwhile, both Bryson Williams and Kevin McCullar Jr. added 14 points as the only other Red Raiders in double-digits.
At the same time, the Red Raiders would toe the line and convert on their opportunities.

     March Madness: Notre Dame Collapses Down Stretch to Texas Tech 59-53
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Overall, Notre Dame as a team shot 33% from the field and 32% (9-of-28) from long range while losing the rebounding battle 42-36 and the turnover battle 11-8.
Texas Tech shot 36% from the floor overall and 27% from long range.
From there, the Irish held a slim lead but could not extend it past 3 at any point, as Texas Tech clawed their way back each time ND threatened to do so.
With 1:21 to go, Tech stole the ball from Blake Wesley, down 1, earning a chance to take the lead on the other end.
Not too shabby considering the numerous low points this season that made us question if they could even make the NIT.
