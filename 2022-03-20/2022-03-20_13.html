     U.S. Capitol riot probe to reveal new details on attack, Cheney says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Richard CowanWASHINGTON (Reuters) – The U.S. Congress’ probe of the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol will reveal new details of that day’s events and may recommend new criminal penalties for officials who fail to uphold their duties, Representative Liz Cheney said on Sunday.
Trump has been openly flirting with the possibility of running again in 2024 at a series of rallies.
Cheney and Representative Adam Kinzinger, who also serves on the special committee, were among the only 10 Republicans who voted early last year to impeach Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 attack.
One police officer who battled rioters on Jan. 6 died the day after the attack and four who guarded the Capitol later died by suicide.
Four rioters also died, including a woman who was shot by a police officer while trying to climb through a shattered window.

     Liz Cheney does not regret vote against Trump Ukraine impeachment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liz Cheney, one of two Republicans on the January 6 committee, does not regret her vote against Donald Trump’s first impeachment, for withholding military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to extract dirt on rivals including Joe Biden.
But Cheney also said on Sunday she was focused on lessons learned from that impeachment as she pursues the investigation of the deadly Capitol attack, the event which led to Trump’s second Senate trial.
Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, the other Republican on the January 6 panel, were among 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump second time round, for inciting an insurrection.
Kinzinger has said that in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he regrets backing Trump in his first impeachment.
In an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press, Cheney was asked about her vote against impeachment on Ukraine.
