     After Three Rounds, Judge Jackson Knows the Confirmation Playbook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden’s Supreme Court pick, knows her way around Senate confirmation hearings.
She has successfully navigated three of them, the most recent one less than a year ago.
When members of the Senate Judiciary Committee question her this week, they will be facing a seasoned pro.
Based on her smooth performance in April in connection with her nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Judge Jackson has mastered the playbook.
She knows how to be cordial and noncommittal, to demonstrate mastery of legal materials while avoiding expressing even a hint of an opinion about them.

     How to watch the confirmation hearings for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington (CNN) Confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will begin Monday, with Democratic leaders setting a goal of reaching a final Senate vote by early April.
If the historic nomination process is successful, Jackson will be the first Black woman to serve on the nation's highest court.
She will be formally introduced Monday after opening statements during televised hearings, followed by two days of questioning and one day of testimony from additional witnesses.
Jackson, 51, currently sits on DC's federal appellate court and had been considered the front-runner for the vacancy since Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement in January.
President Joe Biden , who vowed during the 2020 campaign to select a Black woman to the Supreme Court should a vacancy arise, has already elevated Jackson once, appointing her last year to the appeals court in DC, which is considered the second most powerful federal court in the country.

     Ketanji Brown Jackson hearings begin – could Republicans sink her chances?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Monday’s hearing will be devoted to opening statements from Jackson and from the committee’s 22 senators, who are evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.
In nominating Jackson, Biden honoured the pledge he made during the 2020 presidential election campaign to pick a Black woman for the court.
Leading Republicans have attempted to use Biden’s selection of a Black woman as a stick with which to beat him.
She is unusual among candidates for the supreme court to have had experience as a public defender representing criminal defendants.
That court has been labelled the “second highest court in the land” because so many supreme court justices have been plucked from there.

     Fact check: Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson child porn sentences ‘pretty mainstream’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "In every single child porn case for which we can find records, Judge Jackson deviated from the federal sentencing guidelines in favor of child porn offenders," Hawley tweeted Thursday, highlighting nine cases from her time as a district court judge.
Berman also points out that government prosecutors often request below-range sentences, including in most of the Jackson cases that Hawley cited.
District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump-appointee who served alongside Judge Jackson on the U.S.
Sentencing Commission for a time, also issued below-guidelines sentences in at least four child porn cases, records show.
Judge Jackson has been scrutinized more than any person I can think of.

     Summary: Ketanji Brown Jackson's long judicial record is likely to be scrutinized at hearingstoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe Thesaurus has no synonyms for the phrase, "confirmation hearing."
And beast because when it comes to a Supreme Court nomination, it is treacherous for the nominee, while offering enormous opportunities for her questioners.
Keep that in mind as the Senate Judiciary Committee opens hearings Monday on the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Still, the Senate does have the constitutional authority, and duty, to advise and consent to Supreme Court nominations.
An Unrevealing Judicial RecordBut conservative libertarian Erik Jaffe, policy director of a First Amendment advocacy group, counters that Judge Jackson's record isn't much help because the job of a district court judge is to follow precedent.
