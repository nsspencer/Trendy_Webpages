    </h2>

The Bruins have already reached out to Hampus Lindholm's camp with the intention of trying to work on a contract extension right away.

     Reports: Bruins, Lindholm nearing eight-year contract extension in the neighborhood of $50 million
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If reports are to be believed, the Bruins and Hampus Lindholm appear to be set to cross a big item off the “to-do” list.
The Bruins and Hampus Lindholm’s camp are progressing in talks towards an 8-year extension.
@TSNHockey @TheAthletic — Pierre LeBrun (@PierreVLeBrun) March 20, 2022Expect Hampus Lindholm's eight-year extension with the #bruins to come in with an AAV around $6.5M.
An eight-year deal would take Lindholm to 36 years old, which is quite a commitment for a team to make to a defenseman.
Anyways, it looks like the Bruins are set to sign Lindholm to an eight-year, $52ish million contract.

     Bold Boston Bruins gear up for postseason run, add Anaheim Ducks veteran Hampus Lindholm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Verbeek had spoken with Lindholm on the possibility of an extension, but as Anaheim continues to rebuild, the sides couldn't reach agreeable terms.
"Hampus has been a fixture with the Ducks for years, which we value and respect," Verbeek said in a statement.
The 23-year-old has appeared in 31 NHL games to date, with four assists.
Moore, 31, has one year remaining on his five-year, $13.75 million contract and has appeared in only seven NHL games this season.
The moves made by Bruins general manager Don Sweeney suggests he wants his club to make another push into this postseason.
