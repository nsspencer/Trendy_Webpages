     Report: Bruins, Hampus Lindholm close to finalizing massive extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Feb 7, 2020; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Anaheim Ducks defenseman Hampus Lindholm (47) waits for the face-off during the third period against the Toronto Maple Leafs at Scotiabank Arena.
Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsIt doesn’t sound like the Boston Bruins are going to wait and see with newly-acquired defenseman Hampus Lindholm.
In fact, the 28-year-old Lindholm could very well have a new eight-year extension with the Bruins before even playing a game, according to the latest reports regarding the team’s newest addition.
Expect Hampus Lindholm's eight-year extension with the #bruins to come in with an AAV around $6.5M.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Verbeek had spoken with Lindholm on the possibility of an extension, but as Anaheim continues to rebuild, the sides couldn't reach agreeable terms.
"Hampus has been a fixture with the Ducks for years, which we value and respect," Verbeek said in a statement.
The 23-year-old has appeared in 31 NHL games to date, with four assists.
Moore, 31, has one year remaining on his five-year, $13.75 million contract and has appeared in only seven NHL games this season.
The moves made by Bruins general manager Don Sweeney suggests he wants his club to make another push into this postseason.

     Summary: The Boston Bruins needed to make a major move for a No.
This is a very good trade for the Bruins and bolsters their odds of making a deep playoff run.
Lindholm is a first-pairing caliber defenseman who could play alongside Charlie McAvoy and create one of the best duos on any blue line.
That's a blue line of a legit Stanley Cup contender.
The Bruins weren't going to win the Stanley Cup with their pre-Lindholm blue line.

     The good and the bad of the Hampus Lindholm trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins made their first move of the trade deadline yesterday, acquiring defenseman Hampus Lindholm and defenseman Kodie Curran from the Anaheim Ducks.
So let’s take a look at the good and the bad of Saturday's trade.
So far this season, Lindholm has five goals and 17 assists.
While the AAV of Lindholm’s reported extension is good, the length is cause for concern.
By the end of the reported deal, Lindholm will be 34 years old — while Lindholm could have some great years, by the end of the deal, his performance might drop off, making that AAV seem far less palatable.

All in all Hampus Lindholm is a big bodied, smooth skating defenseman who is able to use his size and his skill to have an impact at both ends of the ice.

Jae C. Hong/AP PhotoDon Sweeney didn’t have the best assets to put on his trade block heading into the trade deadline.
On Saturday, the Bruins landed one of the top left-shot defensemen on the open market in Anaheim’s Hampus Lindholm.
And his potential long-term contract extension could present them with potential long-term ramifications.
The Bruins will have themselves one of the better top-four blue-line units in the league with Lindholm, Charlie McAvoy, Brandon Carlo and Matt Grzelcyk.
