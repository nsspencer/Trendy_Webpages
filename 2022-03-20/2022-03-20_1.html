     Bruins land defenseman Hampus Lindholm in massive trade with Ducks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins have awoken from their pre-NHL trade deadline slumber in a big way.
The Bruins acquired defenseman Hampus Lindholm from the Anaheim Ducks on Saturday in a blockbuster trade that was first reported by ESPN's Kevin Weekes.
That's a hefty price, but Lindholm is nonetheless an excellent addition who fills Boston's need for a left-shot blueliner.
The Bruins were among several teams rumored to be interested in Lindholm prior to Monday's NHL trade deadline.
The Bruins have already reached out to Hampus Lindholm's camp with the intention of trying to work on a contract extension right away.

     Bold Boston Bruins gear up for postseason run, add Anaheim Ducks veteran Hampus Lindholm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Verbeek had spoken with Lindholm on the possibility of an extension, but as Anaheim continues to rebuild, the sides couldn't reach agreeable terms.
"Hampus has been a fixture with the Ducks for years, which we value and respect," Verbeek said in a statement.
The 23-year-old has appeared in 31 NHL games to date, with four assists.
Moore, 31, has one year remaining on his five-year, $13.75 million contract and has appeared in only seven NHL games this season.
The moves made by Bruins general manager Don Sweeney suggests he wants his club to make another push into this postseason.
