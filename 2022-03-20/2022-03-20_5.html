Paolo Banchero (left) scored a game-high 19 in the win.
On Sunday, Hauser scored just five points and shot 1 of 5 from the field for the game.
Still, Krzyzewski was laser-focused on Duke’s resolve after falling behind by five points with just over four minutes left in regulation.

     FINAL: Duke 85, Michigan State 76, Spartans eliminated in second round rivalry classic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In one of the most exciting games of the season, Michigan State was eliminated in the second round of the NCAA tournament in 85-76 loss to Duke.
And then, as it happened all year, Michigan State found themselves in another one of the long scoring droughts that buried them in losses and hamstrung them in wins.
So what did Michigan State do?
As Duke pressed on and Michigan State just kept coming up with something, they got one coveted stop and a clean defensive rebound from Hauser.
Michigan State found better success by taking turns checking Banchero and keeping the Blue Devils from getting clean looks around the perimeter.
