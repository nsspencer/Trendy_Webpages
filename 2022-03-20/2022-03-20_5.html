     Taliban cancel public holiday for Nowruz but say celebrations allowed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Charlotte GreenfieldKABUL (Reuters) – Afghanistan’s Taliban administration said there would be no public holiday for the Persian New Year this week, but said they would not stop people from celebrating the festival.
Persian New Year, known as Nowruz and celebrated throughout Iran and Central Asia, is a popular festival in Afghanistan and usually marked by a public holiday, when families gather to prepare festive dishes and welcome the beginning of spring.
Mohammad Yunus Sidiqi, spokesman for the labour ministry, told Reuters that there would be no official public holiday on Monday, when Nowruz was set to take place.
An information ministry spokesman said the holiday was not in accordance with Islamic law, but that private celebrations by civilians would be allowed.
Though workers will have to return to the office and public university students said exams had been scheduled for Monday, there were signs that Afghans would still celebrate.

     Iranians celebrate Nowruz, mark Perisan New Year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Jaime LeonTehran, Mar 20 (EFE).- Every year with the arrival of spring, Iranians joyfully celebrate Nowruz, known as the Persian New Year, despite the 1979 Iranian Revolution’s attempts to abolish the thousands-year-old pagan festival.
Nowruz, which has its roots in Zoroastrianism and dates back over 3,000 years, is usually celebrated on the first day of the Spring Equinox.
“But Nowruz is an important holiday for us, a very old tradition.
British-Iranian writer Ramita Navai says that Nowruz and everything related to it is as culturally important to Iranians as Muslim holidays.
In addition, a mirror is placed on the table to symbolize reflection, with colored eggs and goldfish, which represent life.
