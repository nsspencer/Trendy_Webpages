     Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum reveal they met after their daughters got into a fight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum have reflected on the unfortunate circumstances of when they met.
The two actors star together in the recently released action-comedy film The Lost City.
In a new interview with The New York Times, the co-stars revealed that one of their first meetings took place in the principal’s office of their children’s preschool after Laila Bullock and Everly Tatum got into a fight.
“We met through drama, in the principal’s office at preschool.
“That’s the reason we did this film, so they could have one long, COVID-safe play date,” said Bullock.

     The Lost City Review: Romancing the Cliché
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet, it’s hard not to notice just how liberally The Lost City lifts elements of both plot and character from Robert Zemeckis’s Romancing the Stone.
During this stretch of the film, Tatum and Pitt lean into the excesses of their characters, mining surprising humor from familiar tropes.
After Loretta is freed and she and Alan run around the island trying to find a way off of it, The Lost City sheds these more eccentric flourishes in favor of blander rom-com trappings.
Despite donning a purple sequin dress for nearly the entirety of The Lost City, Loretta is less a diva than one of Bullock’s familiar “girl next door” types, though one who’s struggling with the death of her husband five years after the fact.
It’s clear that The Lost City is Bullock and Tatum’s show, but its tokenistic moves are further proof that star power and chemistry can only take a film with a mediocre script so far.

     Sandra Bullock on having a newborn during Jesse James split: 'How do you process grief and not hurt your child?'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I was handed a plastic bag and a child," she told Smith.
Shortly after her Oscar win, multiple women went public with claims that they'd had an affair with James, who had been married to Bullock since 2005.
Dealing with the shock of James's betrayal came second to raising her infant son, Bullock told Smith.
Sandra Bullock opens up about raising two Black children and the fallout from her split from Jesse James.
"You worry about other things, but if you really, really, really take a minute and think about [it]," she added, pointing to "hundreds of years of mothers not being able to enjoy, freely, the birth of child; their son becoming a young man.
