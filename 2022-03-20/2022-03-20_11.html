     Does Derek Hough Ever See Himself ‘Dancing With the Stars’ as a Pro Again?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This Sunday, March 20, Derek Hough returns to partnering with celebrities and teaching them routines for ABC’s Step Into… The Movies with Derek and Julianne Hough.
The Oscars special was a throwback to his years as a pro on Dancing With the Stars, which he did for 17 seasons, starting in 2007, winning six Mirror Ball trophies.
And while he now contributes to the show as a judge, Hough does pine a bit for those days of being partnered with a dance novice celeb.
“[Doing Step Into…] gave me that feeling again where I was showing somebody something and they felt, ‘We did it.’”Naturally, that begs the question — does Hough ever see himself taking a break from the judges’ table and returning to the reality show as a pro?
“I did it last year for six weeks and it wasn’t enough!”
