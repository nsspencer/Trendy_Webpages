    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The national championship game rematch is officially set, as 11-seed Michigan upended 3-seed Tennessee, while 2-seed Villanova took down 6-seed Ohio State in the Round of 32.
Both teams will move south to San Antonio, where the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight will take place for the NCAA Tournament’s south region.
CBS announced the next round of matchups while some games are still in progress, but noted the tip time and channel for the highly anticipated matchup.
The two teams met up in the 2018 national championship game — also in San Antonio — where Villanova won thanks to Donte DiVincenzo’s heroics in a 79-62 loss for the Wolverines.
The two teams met again on Villanova’s campus in Nov. 2018, where Michigan got revenge, winning 73-46.

“I think we just continued to do what we did the entire game,” Villanova graduate guard Collin Gillespie said of the defensive mindset.
“They had a stretch where they were hitting shot after shot, and we just said ‘attitude’, stuck together and came together on the defensive end.
They were not concerned about Ohio State finally finding its footing or any calls that didn’t go their way.
As a veteran leader, Gillespie made the read and ultimately recognized that Dixon had the best option.
