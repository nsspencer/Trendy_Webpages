     FINAL: Duke 85, Michigan State 76, Spartans eliminated in second round rivalry classic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In one of the most exciting games of the season, Michigan State was eliminated in the second round of the NCAA tournament in 85-76 loss to Duke.
And then, as it happened all year, Michigan State found themselves in another one of the long scoring droughts that buried them in losses and hamstrung them in wins.
So what did Michigan State do?
As Duke pressed on and Michigan State just kept coming up with something, they got one coveted stop and a clean defensive rebound from Hauser.
Michigan State found better success by taking turns checking Banchero and keeping the Blue Devils from getting clean looks around the perimeter.

     Duke survives scorching Spartans shooting to secure Mike Krzyzewski's 26th Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Duke fought off a barrage of Michigan State 3-pointers and a late Spartans rally to secure Krzyzewski's 1,200th career victory, 26th Sweet 16 and one last win over his friend and rival Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo.
Duke held Michigan State at bay for much of the game.
A second-half Spartans surge gave Michigan State a 70-65 edge with 5:10 remaining, raising the specter among Duke faithful that this might be it for Krzyzewski.
They responded to a 10-0 first-half Duke run and their own 6:03 scoring drought run with seven straight made buckets, four of which were 3-pointers.
“I didn’t see anything but me and the bucket," Moore said of this free throws.
