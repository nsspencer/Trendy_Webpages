     Summary: 11 seed Michigan Wolverines have punched their ticket to San Antonio and the Sweet 16.
Michigan and Ohio State each won a game against each other this year, with each win coming on the road.
So will Ohio State, like the Wolverines last night, win as an underdog to advance to the Sweet 16?
As much as it pains me to say this, I think an Ohio State win today would be awesome.
However, watching Ohio State lose is never a bad thing, so this is truly a win-win scenario for Michigan fans everywhere.
