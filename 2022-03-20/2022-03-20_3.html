     Bruins, Hampus Lindholm agree to huge contract extension after trade with Ducks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins made a major deal Saturday to acquire top-four defenseman Hampus Lindholm from the Anaheim Ducks a little less than 48 hours before the NHL trade deadline.
Not only did the Bruins pull off a blockbuster move, they've also signed Lindholm to a long-term contract extension worth 52 million over eight years, with a $6.5 million salary cap hit.
Hampus Lindholm trade clauses:#NHLBruins22-23 to 26-27: Full NMC27-28 to 29-30: M-NTC (15 team no trade list)https://t.co/4WM3eArrN5 https://t.co/UTVqFjkMDI — CapFriendly (@CapFriendly) March 20, 2022Lindholm is in the final year of his current contract and would have been an unrestricted free agent if unsigned in July.
The Bruins reaching an extension soon after completing the trade for Lindholm is not a surprise -- just look at what they gave up to get him.
You don't part with quality assets like a first-round pick, two second-rounders and a young NHL caliber player in Urho Vaakanainen for a rental.

     Report: Bruins, Hampus Lindholm close to finalizing massive extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Feb 7, 2020; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Anaheim Ducks defenseman Hampus Lindholm (47) waits for the face-off during the third period against the Toronto Maple Leafs at Scotiabank Arena.
Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsUPDATE (Sunday, March 20): The Bruins officially announced a long-term extension for Lindholm.
It doesn’t sound like the Boston Bruins are going to wait and see with newly-acquired defenseman Hampus Lindholm.
In fact, the 28-year-old Lindholm could very well have a new eight-year extension with the Bruins before even playing a game, according to the latest reports regarding the team’s newest addition.
Expect Hampus Lindholm's eight-year extension with the #bruins to come in with an AAV around $6.5M.

     Bold Boston Bruins gear up for postseason run, add Anaheim Ducks veteran Hampus Lindholm
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Verbeek had spoken with Lindholm on the possibility of an extension, but as Anaheim continues to rebuild, the sides couldn't reach agreeable terms.
"Hampus has been a fixture with the Ducks for years, which we value and respect," Verbeek said in a statement.
The 23-year-old has appeared in 31 NHL games to date, with four assists.
Moore, 31, has one year remaining on his five-year, $13.75 million contract and has appeared in only seven NHL games this season.
The moves made by Bruins general manager Don Sweeney suggests he wants his club to make another push into this postseason.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins and newly acquired defenceman Hampus Lindholm agreed to an eight-year, $52 million contract extension on Sunday.
The deal comes a day after the Bruins acquired the Swedish rearguard from the Anaheim Ducks for a 2022 first-round pick, second-round picks in 2023 and 2024, Urho Vaakanainen and John Moore.
Boston also received Kodie Curran and Anaheim will retain 50 per cent of Lindholm's contract at a $5.2 million average annual value.
Lindholm, who was set to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season, receives a raise with his new deal carrying a $6.5 million AAV.
The Bruins (38-19-5) currently hold the first wild card spot in the Eastern Conference and visit the Montreal Canadiens on Monday.

     The good and the bad of the Hampus Lindholm trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins made their first move of the trade deadline yesterday, acquiring defenseman Hampus Lindholm and defenseman Kodie Curran from the Anaheim Ducks.
So let’s take a look at the good and the bad of Saturday's trade.
So far this season, Lindholm has five goals and 17 assists.
While the AAV of Lindholm’s reported extension is good, the length is cause for concern.
By the end of the reported deal, Lindholm will be 34 years old — while Lindholm could have some great years, by the end of the deal, his performance might drop off, making that AAV seem far less palatable.

     Summary: Bruins What the Hampus Lindholm trade means to the Bruins Boston paid a solid price to land the 28-year-old defenseman.
Jae C. Hong/AP PhotoDon Sweeney didn’t have the best assets to put on his trade block heading into the trade deadline.
On Saturday, the Bruins landed one of the top left-shot defensemen on the open market in Anaheim’s Hampus Lindholm.
And his potential long-term contract extension could present them with potential long-term ramifications.
The Bruins will have themselves one of the better top-four blue-line units in the league with Lindholm, Charlie McAvoy, Brandon Carlo and Matt Grzelcyk.
