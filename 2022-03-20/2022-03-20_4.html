     Summary: Justice Clarence Thomas has been hospitalized with an infection, Supreme Court saysEnlarge this image toggle caption Erin Schaff/The New York Times via AP Erin Schaff/The New York Times via APSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, 73, has been hospitalized with an infection since Friday and is expected to be released within the next couple of days, according to the court.
Thomas was admitted to Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., on Friday evening after experiencing "flu-like symptoms," the Supreme Court said in a statement on Sunday evening.
During his absence from Supreme Court proceedings, Justice Thomas will remain involved in the "consideration and discussion" of cases based on written materials and recordings of the oral arguments, the court said.
Thomas is one of the conservative stalwarts on the high court and has served for over 30 years, longer than any other current justice.
As NPR's Nina Totenberg has reported, the health of Supreme Court justices is often cloaked in mystery.

Thomas, 73, is the longest-serving justice on the current court, having joined in October 1991.
Thomas’ hospitalization comes as the U.S. Senate is set to begin confirmation hearings on Monday for Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden’s first nominee to the nation’s highest court.
If confirmed, Jackson would be the third African American to serve on the court, following Thurgood Marshall and Thomas.
The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Monday in an arbitration case, Morgan v. Sundance Inc., and in a case related to North Carolina’s voter ID law, Berger v. North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP.
