     Auburn vs. Miami score: No. 2 seed Tigers' season ends in disappointment with loss to No. 10 seed Hurricanes

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It all flamed out on Sunday evening in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, as the No.
It finished 6-5, doing so despite having Jabari Smith, who's in the conversation to be the No.
Jim Larranaga is going back to the Sweet 16 for the third time at Miami and the fourth time in his career.
The Hurricanes got 21 points from point guard Isaiah Wong and 20 more from All-ACC guard Kameron McGusty.
The Hurricanes held Auburn to just 30% shooting, basically cutting off the Tigers' water in the second half and reducing Smith to a non-factor for most of the game.
