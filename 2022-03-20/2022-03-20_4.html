     History-making Ketanji Brown Jackson set for Senate hearing for the Supreme Court
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Appeals Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson accepts President Joe Biden's nomination to be a U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice and the first Black woman to serve on the court, at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 25, 2022.
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman nominated to the Supreme Court, is going before the Senate Judiciary Committee with the path to her historic confirmation seemingly clear.
Janette McCarthy Wallace, general counsel of the NAACP, said she is excited to see a Black woman on the verge of a high court seat.
Biden chose Jackson in February, fulfilling a campaign pledge to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court for the first time in American history.
Jackson once worked as a high court law clerk to Breyer early in her legal career.

     Confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson begin Monday. Here's what to expect
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson begin Monday.
Democrats are hoping to finish Jackson's confirmation process before Congress leaves for Easter recess April 11.
The hearings, led by the Senate Judiciary Committee, is set to last four days, with Jackson appearing in front of lawmakers during the first three.
Though the confirmation process used to be seen as more of a cross-party effort, it's morphed into a contentious and fiercely partisan process.
Graham is choosing to stay fairly silent – a change from his vocal opposition on the day Jackson's nomination was announced.
