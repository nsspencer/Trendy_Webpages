     Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas hospitalized with flu-like symptoms
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been hospitalized with flu-like symptoms, the court said in a statement Sunday.
Thomas, 73, was admitted to Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, part of the Johns Hopkins Health System, on Friday night, court officials said.
Thomas' symptoms were abating, he was comfortable, and he could be released in the next few days, the court said.
The health and well-being of members of the Supreme Court are always closely watched, particularly for justices whose judicial philosophies differ from that of the party that controls the White House.
Thomas is one of the most conservative members of the Supreme Court.

     Justice Clarence Thomas has been hospitalized with an infection, Supreme Court says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Updated March 20, 2022 at 8:28 PM ETSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, 73, has been hospitalized with an infection since Friday and is expected to be released within the next couple of days, according to the court.
Thomas was admitted to Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., on Friday evening after experiencing "flu-like symptoms," the Supreme Court said in a statement on Sunday evening.
During his absence from Supreme Court proceedings, Justice Thomas will remain involved in the "consideration and discussion" of cases based on written materials and recordings of the oral arguments, the court said.
Thomas is one of the conservative stalwarts on the high court and has served for over 30 years, longer than any other current justice.
As NPR's Nina Totenberg has reported, the health of Supreme Court justices is often cloaked in mystery.
