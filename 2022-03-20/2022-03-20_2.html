Five more free throws for the Devils sent them to the Sweet Sixteen.
But Duke hit 27 two point baskets and 16 free throws along with those five threes.
And Mark Williams, Paolo Banchero and Theo John made like tough inside for Michigan State.

     Duke beats MSU behind Coach K’s championship approach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: GREENVILLE, S.C. — Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski isn’t waiting for New Orleans to win a championship.
Paolo Banchero (left) scored a game-high 19 in the win.
On Sunday, Hauser scored just five points and shot 1 of 5 from the field for the game.
Still, Krzyzewski was laser-focused on Duke’s resolve after falling behind by five points with just over four minutes left in regulation.
“They believe in one another.”That bond was birthed last summer on two road trips to the Nike Peach Jam tournament.

     FALL OF SPARTA: Duke men's basketball holds off Michigan State to advance to Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This was a hard-fought battle through and through, but in the end the Blue Devils came out on top 85-76.
With just over six minutes left in the game, Duke gave up the lead it had been holding for so long, and the pressure was on.
A Michigan State 3-pointer and pair of free throws began to bury the Blue Devils as they found themselves down 70-65 deep in the second half.
After the Spartans opened up an early 7-2 lead, Duke trailed until roughly the 10-minute mark when a Banchero signature midrange jumper gave the Blue Devils a one-point lead.
Next, the Blue Devils head west to San Francisco for the Sweet 16 to play the winner of the Notre Dame-Texas Tech game.
