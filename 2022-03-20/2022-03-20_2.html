     Charles Leclerc wins Bahrain Grand Prix as Max Verstappen retires near the end

     Summary: Hamilton had been lagging way behind in fifth when late drama on Lap 46 changed the race.
Leclerc was leading comfortably from Verstappen when the back of Pierre Gasly’s AlphaTauri car caught fire forcing him to park it on the side of the track.
It was quickly put out and the Frenchman walked away unharmed.
From the restart, Leclerc got away and Verstappen started complaining about steering problems.
A few minutes later both Red Bull drivers were out of the race and George Russell's Mercedes moved up into fourth to give Mercedes an unexpected bonus.

     Charles Leclerc Leads Ferrari 1-2 at Bahrain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2022 preseason testing, their cars looked fast enough to raise some questions that Ferrari could get back to its winning ways at some point this season.
Charles Leclerc dominated today's Formula 1 race at Bahrain from pole, leaping out to an early lead and looking back only to win a brief, dramatic on-track battle with reigning world champion Max Verstappen after his first pit stop.
Carlos Sainz Jr. ran third the entire race, but Max Verstappen reported issues in his car after his final pit stop.
Verstappen held second after a safety car restart, but he eventually lost the spot to Sainz.
In their brief battle for the lead, Leclerc and Verstappen showed the exciting potential of the new car.

     Charles Leclerc Finds Redemption in Bahrain, Reliability Undermines Red Bull
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two years after engine troubles cost him the Bahrain Grand Prix by only three laps, Charles Leclerc has found redemption in Sakhir.
He won the Formula 1 season opening grand prix and led every lap in the process.
I mean, I keep repeating myself, but the last two years have been incredibly difficult for the team,” Leclerc said.
The F1 circuit will next visit the Jeddah Corniche Circuit for the second running of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.
The finishing order for the 2022 Bahrain Grand Prix is:1.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc won Formula One’s season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix after world champion Max Verstappen retired with just three laps remaining and Lewis Hamilton landed a surprise podium.
Verstappen hit technical trouble in the closing moments to promote Carlos Sainz to second as Ferrari completed a one-two finish.
Hamilton fell off Sainz’s Ferrari gearbox and into the clutches off Perez, with the Red Bull driver assuming fourth on lap 10.
But Verstappen was handed another opportunity with just 11 laps remaining when Pierre Gasly’s AlphaTauri caught alight.
Leclerc took the flag 5.5 seconds clear of Sainz with Hamilton four seconds further back following Perez’s late failure.

     Summary: Passed twice in two laps, Leclerc fought back both times to regain the lead and then hold it for a deserved victory.
“The last two years have been incredibly difficult for the team,” said Leclerc.
In pace terms Ferrari and Red Bull were the class of the field under F1’s new regulations but, where Ferrari had the perfect start, Red Bull were left pointless and facing a difficult inquiry into what happened.

     Formula 1: Charles LeClerc leads Ferrari 1-2 at Bahrain as Red Bull doesn't score points
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Verstappen was then forced to retire his Red Bull car with three laps to go as it had a power unit problem.
Verstappen's troubles allowed Ferrari's Carlos Sainz to pass him for second and then Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez moved into third after Verstappen went into the pits to retire his car.
Mercedes was a distant third to the Ferraris and Red Bull cars throughout the entire race.
We all figured the constructor’s title would again be a fight between Mercedes and Red Bull, but if Ferrari’s performance at Bahrain is any indication, it could be in the mix too.
Ferrari has not won the team title in F1 since 2008 and no team other than Red Bull or Mercedes has won the team title since now-defunct Brawn Racing in 2009.
