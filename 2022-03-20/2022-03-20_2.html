     Paolo Banchero calls out apparent Duke disrespect
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Duke is often seen as a powerhouse in college basketball, but one of its players believed his team was underrated heading into the NCAA tournament and decided to air out some of his frustrations on Twitter.
“they said we weren’t making it out of the first weekend,” Duke forward Paolo Banchero said in the tweet.
“see ya’ll on the best coast.”Banchero didn’t mention anyone specifically, but it’s unclear who the big man is referring to.
Duke was down five with five minutes remaining, but closed out the game with a scoring surge to get coach Mike Krzyzewski his 1,200th career win and 99th NCAA tournament win.

     FALL OF SPARTA: Duke men's basketball holds off Michigan State to advance to Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This was a hard-fought battle through and through, but in the end the Blue Devils came out on top 85-76.
With just over six minutes left in the game, Duke gave up the lead it had been holding for so long, and the pressure was on.
A Michigan State 3-pointer and pair of free throws began to bury the Blue Devils as they found themselves down 70-65 deep in the second half.
After the Spartans opened up an early 7-2 lead, Duke trailed until roughly the 10-minute mark when a Banchero signature midrange jumper gave the Blue Devils a one-point lead.
Next, the Blue Devils head west to San Francisco for the Sweet 16 to play the winner of the Notre Dame-Texas Tech game.

     Duke Blows By Michigan State In Winning Time, 85-76
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Michigan State had its share of runs Sunday evening against Duke, the final one threatening to knock Duke out of the arena.
But Duke had the final run, a monster one, 20-6 to be exact, leaving Duke with a deceptively one-sided 85-76 win over the Spartans that sends Duke to its 26th Sweet Sixteen since 1986.
Duke extended its first-half lead to seven points on several occasions, the last at 31-24, ending a 16-8 Duke run.
But Williams scored the last four points of the half and Duke took a tenuous 39-35 lead into intermission.
Duke’s lead shrunk, then disappeared and then suddenly, ominously Duke was behind 70-65, with 5:10 left, Duke on the short end of a 16-4 Spartans surge, four Duke points in a span over five minutes, Michigan State guard Ty Walker in control of the game.

     Summary: All season, Duke struggled to protect leads.
On Sunday, the Blue Devils coughed up a nine-point cushion to Michigan State.
Krzyzewski vs. Tom Izzo was no doubt the NCAA's dream matchup when it placed Duke and Michigan State in the same region.
Duke basketball fell behind by 5 points in the late stages against Michigan State, before clawing the game back.
When Michigan State took the lead in the second half, Krzyzewski said his team looked young.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 7 Michigan State with five minutes remaining in this feverish, meeting-the-hype second round NCAA Tournament game.
There's a chance the final five minutes of Sunday's 85-76 win over Michigan State winds up being the best and/or most important stretch of Duke's campaign.
The Blue Devils responded to their largest deficit of the night by turning Michigan State upside down.
Over the course of five minutes, Duke defended Michigan State to the tune of 2-of-9 shooting and a turnover.
The potential was there for it all to end for Duke and K, for Michigan State to spoil.
