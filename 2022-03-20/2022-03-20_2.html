     Today is: The First Day of Spring
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: News Journal/News-MessengerUSA Today NetworkThe First Day of Spring, also known as the vernal equinox or spring equinox, takes place when the sun crosses the celestial equator — an imaginary line in the sky directly above the Earth's equator — from south to the north.
When the spring equinox occurs in the Northern Hemisphere, the autumnal equinox occurs in the Southern Hemisphere.
During this time, the sun shines directly on the equator, and the length of day and night is nearly equal.
Days continue to lengthen in the Northern Hemisphere as the Earth's axis begins to tilt toward the Sun, and days shorten in the Southern Hemisphere as the opposite occurs there.
With this, spring, which is the transition period from winter to summer, is started in the Northern Hemisphere.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Spring officially begins in the Northern Hemisphere on March 20 with the vernal equinox as the entire world experiences an equal day and night.
For ease of recordkeeping, meteorologists and climatologists consider March 1 the first day of spring, but astronomically speaking, the Earth’s equator is aligned directly with the sun on the vernal equinox.
On the winter solstice in December, the sun's most direct rays are positioned over the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5 degrees south latitude).
On the vernal equinox in March and the autumnal equinox in September, the equator (0 degrees latitude) is aligned directly with the sun.
The solar-noon sun angle is the lowest and farthest south in the sky on the winter solstice.
