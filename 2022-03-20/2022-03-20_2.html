     Ohio State basketball: Why Buckeyes have a great shot at making the Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Ohio State basketball team is preparing for their round of 32 matchup in the NCAA Tournament with the 2nd-seeded Villanova Wildcats.
Seeing their name next to Ohio State’s is awfully scary for how much of a powerhouse Villanova has been.
However, I think the Buckeyes have a really good shot at upsetting the Wildcats and making it to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2013.
This game will be much different than Ohio State’s first-round win.
First, this Ohio State basketball team matches up really well with this Villanova team.

Going against a Loyola team that was in the Final Four not that long ago, Coach Holtmann’s squad was the underdog.
The Ramblers flat-out stunk shooting and OSU looked mighty different with Kyle Young and Zed Key back after injury absences.

This Villanova team is so tough because they can get it from a lot of different guys.
I have Villanova winning this game in a close one and bringing Ohio State’s season to a close.
Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, this is a Villanova team that does not beat themselves and forces their opponents into mistakes.
