     Summary: Indeed, Riley was facing a situation he hadn’t been in in his 24 previous tour starts.
The former Alabama All-American whose career-best 62 on Saturday at the Copperhead Course vaulted him into a two-stroke lead over Matthew NeSmith, had never been better than T-15 entering the final round of a tournament so far in his young tour career.
That was at The American Express in January, and he wound up finishing T-59.
His best spot entering any round was a T-5 back in January.
