     Tottenham 3-1 West Ham: Spurs up to fifth place in Premier League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The race for fourth place in the Premier League got a little bit tighter as Tottenham Hotspur claimed a 2-1 victory over West Ham United on Sunday.
Both teams are in the hunt for England's last 2022-23 Champions League spot, currently held by Arsenal.
Visiting West Ham dug themselves into an early hole on Sunday when Kurt Zouma scored an own goal in the ninth minute to give Tottenham the lead.
Spurs did well to control the second half, not allowing any West Ham shots on target over the course of the closing 45 minutes.

     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur Security Staff Stop Two Protesters From Tying Themselves To GoalpostsThree days after a pitch invader tied himself to a goalpost at Goodison Park, two more protesters tried and failed to imitate him at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
Similar tee-shirts were worn by a man and a woman who invaded the pitch during Sunday's game between Tottenham and West Ham.
But neither of them was able to fix themself to the goal frame before being caught and ejected by stadium security.
The result saw Tottenham jump above Manchester United into fifth place in the Premier League table.
Spurs also moved three points clear of West Ham, who have played one game extra.

     Summary: Tottenham 3-1 West Ham (Zouma og 9′, Son 24′, 88′; Benrahma 35′)Tottenham head coach Antonio Conte says his side’s only target is to qualify for the Champions League after a vital win over West Ham.

“We know very well the difficulty to reach this target but it’s right to start because Tottenham needs to have the ambition to play in the best competition.
It's Tottenham 1-0 West Ham.
Defeat, which came despite Said Benrahma’s first-half goal, is a big blow to their own top four hopes, which Moyes concedes have probably ended.
