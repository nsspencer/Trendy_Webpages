     Taylor Fritz Upsets Rafael Nadal to Win 2022 Indian Wells Men's Final

Fritz not only won the first set, but he did so in rather dominant fashion with three breaks in five of Nadal's service games.
Nadal fought through it and earned a break early in the second set, but Fritz broke right back and seized the momentum.
He responded each time and forced a tiebreak, but Fritz emerged with a win over a legend.

     In Indian Wells stunner, Taylor Fritz hands Rafael Nadal first loss of 2022, and wins his first ATP Masters 1000 title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Many thought Rafael Nadal might pull even with Novak Djokovic in the ATP Masters 1000 title count‚Äîat an astonishing 37‚Äîwithout ever striking a tennis ball on Sunday.
It was the kind of first-strike tennis necessary to defeat Nadal, even if the California native was feeling 100 percent.
When Fritz took a 4-0 lead without losing a single point on serve, his ankle was an afterthought‚Äîand the conversation suddenly shifted to Nadal's physical condition.
But all it took was a game for Fritz to regain the break and put Nadal back in a negative and precarious position.
In a 10-minute game that followed, Nadal failed to convert a series of break points, putting Fritz closer to his very first Masters title.
