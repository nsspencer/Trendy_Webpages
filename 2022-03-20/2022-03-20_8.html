     Summary: Feb 17, 2020; Calgary, Alberta, CAN; Anaheim Ducks defenseman Hampus Lindholm (47) against the Calgary Flames during the third period at Scotiabank Saddledome.
Mandatory Credit: Sergei Belski-USA TODAY SportsThe trade deadline itch finally got to Bruins general manager Don Sweeney on Saturday, as the Bruins made their first move ahead of Monday’s deadline with the acquisition of left-shot defenseman Hampus Lindholm from the Anaheim Ducks.
It’s the kind of home run swing the Bruins positioned themselves to make with what’s been a white-hot 2022 calendar year to date, and was considered a borderline must entering a pivotal deadline for Sweeney and the Bruins.
And there’s a whole lot to unpack as Lindholm makes his way to Boston.

     Bruins, Hampus Lindholm agree to huge contract extension after trade with Ducks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins made a major deal Saturday to acquire top-four defenseman Hampus Lindholm from the Anaheim Ducks a little less than 48 hours before the NHL trade deadline.
Not only did the Bruins pull off a blockbuster move, they've also signed Lindholm to a long-term contract extension worth 52 million over eight years, with a $6.5 million salary cap hit.

The Bruins reaching an extension soon after completing the trade for Lindholm is not a surprise -- just look at what they gave up to get him.
You don't part with quality assets like a first-round pick, two second-rounders and a young NHL caliber player in Urho Vaakanainen for a rental.

    </h2>

     Summary: BOSTON -- Hampus Lindholm got to experience the playoffs in each of his first five NHL seasons.
So when the longtime Anaheim Ducks defenseman saw an opportunity to sign on with a Boston Bruins team that reached the postseason almost every year, he was willing to make a long-term commitment.
"They find ways to get in the mix and compete," said Lindholm, a 2012 first-round draft pick who had played his entire career in Anaheim.
6 overall pick in the 2012 draft, Lindholm has five goals and 17 assists in 61 games this season.
Boston also acquired minor league defenseman Kodie Curran in the trade; the Ducks will pay half of Lindholm's salary this season.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins have signed defenseman Hampus Lindholm to an eight-year contract extension that will give him a cap hit of $6.5 million annually, one day after acquiring him from the Anaheim Ducks.
On Saturday, the Ducks traded Lindholm to the Boston Bruins in exchange for a 2022 first-round pick, a 2023 second-round pick, a 2024 second-round pick plus defensemen Urho Vaakanainen and John Moore.
Lindholm was a pending unrestricted free agent and has 22 points in 61 games this season while averaging 22:32 of ice time per contest.
The Ducks parted with their top-four defenseman after nine seasons after being unable to reach a contract extension.
Verbeek added to his asset haul after getting defenseman prospect Drew Helleson and a 2023 second-round pick from Colorado for Manson.

Jae C. Hong/AP PhotoDon Sweeney didn’t have the best assets to put on his trade block heading into the trade deadline.
On Saturday, the Bruins landed one of the top left-shot defensemen on the open market in Anaheim’s Hampus Lindholm.
And his potential long-term contract extension could present them with potential long-term ramifications.
The Bruins will have themselves one of the better top-four blue-line units in the league with Lindholm, Charlie McAvoy, Brandon Carlo and Matt Grzelcyk.

     The good and the bad of the Hampus Lindholm trade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Bruins made their first move of the trade deadline yesterday, acquiring defenseman Hampus Lindholm and defenseman Kodie Curran from the Anaheim Ducks.
So let’s take a look at the good and the bad of Saturday's trade.
So far this season, Lindholm has five goals and 17 assists.
While the AAV of Lindholm’s reported extension is good, the length is cause for concern.
By the end of the reported deal, Lindholm will be 36 years old — while Lindholm could have some great years, by the end of the deal, his performance might drop off, making that AAV seem far less palatable.
