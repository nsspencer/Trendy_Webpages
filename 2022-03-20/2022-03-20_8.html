     Trump's 2024 politicking looks like it's breaking campaign finance law
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former President Donald Trump constantly talks about how he’s almost certainly going to run for president again, although he has refrained from making it official.
Now, a complaint filed to the Federal Election Commission is underscoring how his theatrical hinting act could be violating campaign finance law.
American Bridge, a Democratic super PAC, has filed a complaint with the FEC arguing that Trump is illegally spending political funds on a presidential campaign without officially declaring his candidacy.
Trump’s rhetorical sleights of hand raise the possibility that his de facto third presidential campaign is already marked by corruption.
Trump’s rhetorical strategy of running for the White House without officially running for the White House is, from a campaign finance perspective, having his cake and eating it too.

     Summary: Former President Donald Trump on Saturday promised to return to the White House in 2024.
"In 2024, we are going to take back our beautiful White House," Trump said at the American Freedom Tour.
At the rally, Trump again falsely claimed that he had won the 2020 presidential election.
Since losing the 2020 presidential election, Trump has continued to peddle the false claim that he actually won.
At the same time, he's been teasing a 2024 presidential bid and a return to the White House.

Barr acknowledges, and then shrugs off, Trump’s lies about election fraud and his incitement of an assault on the U.S. Capitol.
“In the final months of his administration,” Barr writes, “Trump cared only about one thing: himself.
Does Barr believe Trump did not prioritize himself over country and party during the first three and a half years of his presidency?
When the former attorney general recalls his oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States,” what — I wonder — does he think it entails?

     How the GOP's dirtiest slur got a new life
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In previous decades, a Republican risked getting tagged as a RINO for supporting tax increases, gun control or abortion rights.
Today, in a reflection of the GOP’s murkier ideological grounding in the Trump era, it’s a term reserved almost exclusively for lack of fealty to Trump.
During just the past six months, the list of Republicans Trump has branded with the term includes Arizona Gov.
Brian Kemp a “RINO governor.”The term is now so ubiquitous, said James Dickey, the former chair of the Texas Republican Party, that it’s suffering from overuse.
Republican primary voters are anesthetized to that,” he said.
