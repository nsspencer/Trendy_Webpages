Iowa State shot 34.5 percent from the floor, which was at least better than Wisconsin (29.5 percent) fared.
Kalscheur went to the bench shortly thereafter, at which point Iowa State couldn't buy a bucket.
Iowa State will likely need more from Hunter and Brockington in order to continue on to the Elite Eight, though.

     Summary: Box score:Iowa State 54, Wisconsin 49More:Wisconsin loses point guard Chucky Hepburn to ankle injury in first half against Iowa StateDavis looked crestfallen as he untucked his jersey top.
The Badgers, already without backup point guard Lorne Bowman (illness), lost Hepburn with 4 minutes 37 left in the first half when the freshman suffered an ugly left-ankle injury.
That forced Gard to have Davison move to point guard and Jahcobi Neath and Jordan Davis try to shadow Iowa State point guard Tyrese Hunter.
The senior guard hit 5 of 9 shots in the opening half and scored 10 points to help the Cyclones take a 27-26 lead.
Izaiah Brockington, the Cyclones' leading scorer at 17.1 points per game, hit only 4 of 15 shots and finished with 10 points.
