Iowa State shot 34.5 percent from the floor, which was at least better than Wisconsin (29.5 percent) fared.
Kalscheur went to the bench shortly thereafter, at which point Iowa State couldn't buy a bucket.
Iowa State will likely need more from Hunter and Brockington in order to continue on to the Elite Eight, though.

ISU advanced to its first Sweet 16 appearance since 2016, when Otzelberger served as an assistant, and it will play Friday in Chicago.
Iowa State on Friday became the team with the lowest winning percentage (.083) in the previous season to win an NCAA tournament game, as it outlasted LSU 59-54.
Iowa State allowed only 103 points total in its first two tournament games.

But Iowa State used a 9-0 run almost midway through the second half to build some distance from the Badgers.
Wisconsin had 13 trips to the free-throw line in the first half while Iowa State had just two.
Iowa State’s upset win came despite Wisconsin playing only about 80 miles away from its campus and having a significant home-court advantage.
Iowa State won’t have to go far for the next round.
