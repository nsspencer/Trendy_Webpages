     ‘Sanditon,’ Unfinished No More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Charlotte, are you not excited to be returning?”When that question is posed in the opening moments of the trailer for the second season of “Sanditon,” it sounds very much like a humorous nod to the show’s own history.
“Sanditon,” based on Jane Austen’s unfinished final novel, first aired in Britain in 2019, and wasn’t renewed by its principal broadcaster, ITV, after disappointing viewing numbers.
But the show, which had largely positive reviews, garnered a passionate following, and after a well-focused campaign by fans and a successful American run in early 2020, “Sanditon” is now returning for at least two more seasons.
This eventually led to the formation of a fan group called the Sanditon Sisterhood, which began a mass Twitter campaign organized around the hashtag #SaveSanditon.
“It was so well done, there was a group of incredible women, a great romance, and then, like the book, the story was unfinished at the end of the season.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sanditon is finally returning to PBS, two years after the original season became a surprise ratings hit.
Theo James played the dashing Sidney Parker in the first season, which ended with the two characters declaring their love to each other.
That love, however, will remain unconsummated, as James will not be returning for Season 2 of the Masterpiece show.
Why Is Theo James Not in Sanditon Season 2?
Sanditon Season 2 airs Sundays at 9 p.m.

     How ‘Sanditon’ Handled Sidney’s Season 2 Exit — And Why It Happened That Way
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [Warning: The below contains MAJOR spoilers for the Sanditon Season 2 premiere.]
Viewers have known for a year that Sidney’s portrayer, Theo James, wouldn’t be reprising his role for the Masterpiece series’ sophomore season.
New head writer Justin Young told a Television Critics Association panel in January that Sidney’s untimely demise would reverberate throughout the season.
“It gave us this enormous emotional event at the beginning of the [season] that sets up all the stories,” he explained.
“Really, the season becomes about that in a way — how everyone moves on from Sidney.”See Also Inside 'Sanditon' Season 2 With the Cast: 'This Is Charlotte's Story' Get scoop from the gorgeous new set of the Masterpiece series' long-awaited second season, from Sidney's farewell to new relationships on the horizon.

     Sanditon Season 2 Premiere Recap: Charlotte Meets Two New Suitors, Mourns Sidney — Plus, Grade It!
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s one thing to know that Charlotte lost Sidney to Eliza Campion on Sanditon, but it’s something altogether different to discover that death would soon steal him away forever.
By episode’s end, Tom, Mary and Arthur learned that Sidney was in Antigua to handle some business for Georgiana, but what the matter was is not yet known.
Tom and Mary chastised Georgiana for her lack of tact when turning down a now-offended Lord Kingsley.
In the hopes of making Georgiana more agreeable, Tom and Mary sent for her bestie Charlotte, who brought her sister Alison with her.
Georgiana, Alison and Charlotte went to meet some of the British soldiers and quickly made the acquaintance of a muscular, shirtless and agreeable Colonel Francis Lennox, who wasted no time setting his sights on Charlotte.

     Summary: T&amp;C spoke to the show’s head writer, Justin Young, about the challenges and joys of taking up where they all left off two years ago.
We all know the structure of a Jane Austen novel.
A company of handsome soldiers finds its way to Sanditon in season two.
Another inspiration was, of course, Jane Austen.
Charlotte Heywood (played by Rose Williams) and Georgiana Lambe (played by Crystal Clarke) are central characters in season two.

It’s a fresh start for Charlotte, Georgiana, and all of Sanditon.
He and his sister are bringing a strong Dickens vibe in episode one, though, and I appreciate them for it.
In another interesting change to this season, Georgiana is leading a boycott of sugar in the town, hoping that plantation owners who enslave people will be forced to change their ways.
The Hankinses hand out pamphlets about the boycott (they really do seem great this season), which Lady Denham immediately pooh-poohs.

     'Sanditon' Season 2 Episode 1 Recap: guess who’s back?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With another perfect quip, G escapes them to meet up with Charlotte, who’s getting a tour of the new and improved (and hopefully heavily insured) Sanditon.
Lady D thinks sedition is a legit concern, and like most rich people, knows she’d be in trouble if a rabble is indeed roused.
Tom intends to buy her out, but I still have concerns, and so does Lady D. Tom’s plan: get money off the regiment.
Lady D, unsurprisingly, has a bad take on this, and thinks the boycott isn’t worth it because it won’t amount to anything.
Lady D doesn’t think she needs help; after all, Horrible Ed does seem genuinely contrite!
