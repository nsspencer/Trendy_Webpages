     BA.2 variant surge ‘unlikely’ in United States, says Fauci, but uptick in coronavirus cases expected
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — The nation’s top infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said on Sunday that the United States should prepare to see an uptick in coronavirus cases due to the latest BA.2 variant, but that a surge is unlikely.
While the United States can expect an increase in coronavirus cases, Fauci predicts there won’t be a surge.
So, that’s really where we stand right now.”Fauci explained that the BA.2 variant has an increased transmission capability.
The news comes while several states are reducing coronavirus safety restrictions.
The country has to be prepared to put some of those restrictions back in place, Fauci said.

     U.S. COVID Infections Likely to Rise Again, Fauci Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Posted Sunday, March 20, 2022 11:49 amWASHINGTON — A likely rise in U.S. COVID-19 cases probably won’t amount to a full-scale surge or prompt a renewal of widespread restrictions, one of President Joe Biden’s top advisers said.
“The bottom line is we likely will see an uptick in cases, as we’ve seen in the European countries, particularly the U.K.,” Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday.
BA.2 is about 50% more transmissible than the original strain of omicron, but it doesn’t cause more severe illness or evade immunity from vaccinations or an earlier infection, Fauci said.
Fauci, 81, tamped down speculation that he might be ready to retire.
I think we are clearly going in the right direction.

     Summary: The US is likely to see an increase in Covid cases like that in Europe and the UK thanks to the BA.2 virus subvariant but not a dangerous surge, Anthony Fauci said on Sunday.
Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser also said the US was “clearly going in the right direction” on the coronavirus pandemic.
BA.2, Fauci told ABC’s This Week, “has a degree of transmission advantage over the original Omicron [variant], but not multifold advantage.
“So the bottom line is we likely will see an uptick in cases as we’ve seen in the European countries, particularly the UK, where … they have BA.2.
“We just can’t stand still,” he said, “particularly as we appear to be in somewhat of a lull … where cases continue to come down, deaths continue to come down and hospitalisations [too].
