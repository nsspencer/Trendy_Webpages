Similar tee-shirts were worn by a man and a woman who invaded the pitch during Sunday's game between Tottenham and West Ham.
But neither of them was able to fix themself to the goal frame before being caught and ejected by stadium security.
The result saw Tottenham jump above Manchester United into fifth place in the Premier League table.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Protesters took to the pitch at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday evening to tie themselves to the goal posts.
The two anti-oil protesters - wearing 'just stop oil' t-shirts - were removed by stewards during the second half of Tottenham's Premier League fixture with West Ham.
The stewards were quick to defuse the situation and remove the protesters from the pitch to allow play to continue.
The eyebrow-raising incident appeared to have been a protest, with the individual sporting an orange t-shirt emblazoned with the words 'just stop oil'.
A group called Just Stop Oil, who are against the expansion of oil fields in the North Sea, claimed responsibility for the incident.
