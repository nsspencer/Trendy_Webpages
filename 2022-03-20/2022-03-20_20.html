     Unlikely star Ethan Morton's defense? Sweet. Very, very sweet as Purdue storms on
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Coach Matt Painter made a significant adjustment early in the second half, putting Morton on Texas star guard Marcus Carr.
And with that, Purdue had all but sealed up its 6th trip to the Sweet 16 under Painter.
He did the same thing 2 years later at Texas Tech, when the Red Raiders nuked Purdue in the Sweet 16.
But Purdue punched its ticket to the Sweet 16 by punching back against the Longhorns.
Morton forced Carr into left turns, preventing him from going to his right where he’s a more prolific scorer.

     Purdue spent all night at the free-throw line and still struggled to put away Texas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Texas fans certainly have a legitimate gripe after witnessing the 81-71 season-ending loss Sunday at Fiserv Forum.
“I have to be careful of what I say,” Texas coach Chris Beard said diplomatically.
But Timmy Allen, Texas’ leading scorer, was held to just two points and fouled out with 6:25 left.
But Williams mostly forced the action and racked up Texas fouls with his nifty post moves and baby hook shot.
Everyone else, even seniors like Allen, Jones, Ramey and Carr, still have a COVID-19 year of eligibility at their disposal.
