     Summary: Indeed, Riley was facing a situation he hadn’t been in in his 24 previous tour starts.
The former Alabama All-American whose career-best 62 on Saturday at the Copperhead Course vaulted him into a two-stroke lead over Matthew NeSmith, had never been better than T-15 entering the final round of a tournament so far in his young tour career.
That was at The American Express in January, and he wound up finishing T-59.
His best spot entering any round was a T-5 back in January.

     Davis Riley on costly triple bogey in 2022 Valspar Championship final round: 'it was just kind of a cluster'

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Davis Riley stood on the par-5 5th tee during the final round of the 2022 Valspar Championship with a two-shot lead.
The 25-year-old PGA Tour rookie made the only triple bogey of the week on No.
After a wayward drive to the left, Riley struggled to get to the green, chunking an approach in-between a pair of drops before the struggles continued around the green.
Following a pair of poor pitches that failed to find the green, Riley two-putted from the rough to put the carrot on the snowman.
