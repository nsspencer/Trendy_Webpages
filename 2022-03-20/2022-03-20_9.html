     No. 3 Texas Tech Avoids No. 11 Notre Dame's Upset Bid, Will Face Duke in Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Red Raiders beat Notre Dame 59-53 on Sunday in what was a scrappy, tight matchup at the NCAA men's basketball tournament.
It wasn't an aesthetically pleasing win, but Texas Tech is heading to the Sweet 16 all the same.
Granted, he's come up big in March in the past:Add in his work on the boards, and he was huge for Texas Tech.
Notre Dame, playing its third game this week after being in the First Four, appeared to run out of gas down the stretch.
Texas Tech will face No.

     Twitter reacts to Notre Dame's NCAA Tournament loss to Texas Tech
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Notre Dame had the lead and the ball with just over 1:30 left in Sunday night’s NCAA Tournament Second Round game with Texas Tech, ultimately falling 59-53 and seeing their season come to an end.
It’s frustrating in that the game was winnable and a sour way to close what was an impressive turnaround for a Fighting Irish squad that was just 4-5 after falling to Indiana on December 18.
Texas Tech now advances to take on Duke in the Sweet 16 after the Blue Devils got by Michigan State in the Second Round.

     Texas Tech basketball: Gritty win leads Red Raiders to Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a team, Tech would go 13-14 at the line in the second 20 minutes after missing all three of their attempts in the first half.
And given how poorly the Red Raiders shot the ball on the night, they needed every point they could get at the line.
Leading Tech by doing the dirty work all night, Obanor paced Tech in scoring with 15 points and rebounding with 15 boards.
Meanwhile, both Bryson Williams and Kevin McCullar Jr. added 14 points as the only other Red Raiders in double-digits.
At the same time, the Red Raiders would toe the line and convert on their opportunities.
