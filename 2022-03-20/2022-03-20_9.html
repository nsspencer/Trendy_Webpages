     Rise in US COVID-19 infections is unlikely to cause surge, Fauci says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Hopefully we won’t see a surge.
I don’t think we will.”A likely rise in US COVID-19 cases probably won’t amount to a full-scale surge or prompt a renewal of widespread restrictions, one of President Joe Biden’s top advisers said.
BA.2 is about 50% more transmissible than the original strain of omicron, but it doesn’t cause more severe illness or evade immunity from vaccinations or an earlier infection, Fauci said.
Fauci and US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy urged Congress to pass a stalled package of new COVID-19 relief.
Fauci, 81, tamped down speculation that he might be ready to retire.

     New Omicron Variant Unlikely to Cause Surge in US, Uptick Possible: Fauci
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chief White House medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that he does not think the U.S. will see a major COVID-19 surge from a new version of the Omicron variant, but that an uptick in cases is more likely.
Speaking on ABC's This Week, Fauci noted that while the BA.2 Omicron variant has a high level of transmissibility, it does not appear to cause more severe illness or evade immune responses from vaccinated individuals or those with prior infections.
"It has a degree of transmission advantage over the original Omicron," Fauci said, noting that it may be up to 50 or 60 percent more transmissible.
I don't think we will.
That marked a nearly 14 percent increase from the previous week, showing that the variant is already on the rise.

     US likely to see Covid cases rise from Omicron subvariant, Fauci says

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US is likely to see an increase in Covid cases like that in Europe and the UK thanks to the BA.2 virus subvariant but not a dangerous surge, Anthony Fauci said on Sunday.
Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser also said the US was “clearly going in the right direction” on the coronavirus pandemic.
BA.2, Fauci told ABC’s This Week, “has a degree of transmission advantage over the original Omicron [variant], but not multifold advantage.
“So the bottom line is we likely will see an uptick in cases as we’ve seen in the European countries, particularly the UK, where … they have BA.2.
“We just can’t stand still,” he said, “particularly as we appear to be in somewhat of a lull … where cases continue to come down, deaths continue to come down and hospitalisations [too].
