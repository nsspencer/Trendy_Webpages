     Isiah Thomas Marvels At LeBron James Who Surpassed Karl Malone To Become Second-Highest All-Time Scorer: "Once In A Lifetime Player"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, the game saw LeBron set a massive individual record as he surpassed Karl Malone to become the second in the all-time NBA scoring charts.
At LeBron's current scoring pace, he would break the record in the 2022-23 NBA season, barring any serious injury.
As James is cementing himself in the all-time NBA leaderboards, former two-time NBA Champion Isiah Thomas took to Twitter for a ringing endorsement of James by calling him a 'once in a lifetime player'.
We are in the final few years of watching LeBron James play basketball and it is quite incredible to see James keep up his offensive productivity even at the age of 37.
LeBron James will go down in history as one of the greatest regardless of how this season ends for LA.
