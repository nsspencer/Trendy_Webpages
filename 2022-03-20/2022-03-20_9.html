     On Eve of Confirmation Hearings, G.O.P. Steps Up Attacks on Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Mr. Hawley’s accusation added a new element to the debate, focusing more on her time as a federal district court judge and a member of the sentencing commission.
Other Republican members have said they intend to pursue the issue with Judge Jackson.
Still, Judge Jackson, with her White House entourage in tow, has engaged in a charm offensive in the Senate, meeting with 44 senators of both parties and all 22 members of the evenly divided Judiciary Committee.
Democrats have been effusive in their praise and support of Judge Jackson, calling her an ideal candidate for the court with the capacity to work with other justices to try to develop more consensus rulings.
But they say they have also been frustrated by her unwillingness to lay out a specific judicial philosophy and her refusal to take a stance on whether the Supreme Court should be expanded, as progressive groups have proposed.

     Summary: (CNN) Like most every other nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has been participating behind closed doors in so-called "moot court" sessions to prepare for her upcoming hearings, according to a source familiar.
"Judge Jackson has been scrutinized more than any person I can think of.
Out of the gate, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas asked her if she had "ever represented a terrorist at Guantanamo Bay."
Another was Judge Dabney L. Friedrich whom Trump went on to nominate to United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas lamented "skyrocketing crime rates, skyrocketing burglary rates, and skyrocketing carjacking rates."
