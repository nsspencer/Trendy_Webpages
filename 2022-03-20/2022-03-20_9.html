     In El Clasico, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang proves he is the final piece of the puzzle Barcelona didn't know they needed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, though, Aubameyang and Barca looks like a match that was always meant to be.
Aubameyang has made an astonishing impact for his new club, scoring nine goals in his first 10 games.
Against Real Madrid in Sunday‚Äôs Clasico, the 32-year-old was rampant, scoring twice and assisting another in a statement 4-0 victory.
Aubameyang has been the final piece of the puzzle Xavi, who recently described the Gabon international as ‚Äúa gift from heaven,‚Äù didn‚Äôt even know his team needed.
What Xavi didn‚Äôt envisage was the space this approach would create for a natural finisher like Aubameyang.
