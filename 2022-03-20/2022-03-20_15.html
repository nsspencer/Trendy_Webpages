     LA Marathon 2022 Results: Men's and Women's Top Finishers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Xinhua/Qian Weizhong via Getty ImagesDelvine Meringor won the women's division and John Korir emerged victorious in the men's division at the 2022 Los Angeles Marathon on Sunday, which featured a course from Dodger Stadium to the Avenue of the Stars.
It's the second Los Angeles Marathon in four months because last year's edition of the event was delayed until November because of COVID-19 concerns.
The L.A. marathon was one of the final major sporting events in March 2020 before much of the sporting world was halted because of the coronavirus.
Competitors experience a unique trip around the Los Angeles area with the course winding through several iconic areas, highlighted by runs on Sunset Boulevard and Rodeo Drive during a journey that includes downtown L.A., Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica.
Next up for long-distance runners is the Boston Marathon on April 18, which is the first stop for this year's World Marathon Majors series.
