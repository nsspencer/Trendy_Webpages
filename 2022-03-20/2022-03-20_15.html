     ALBUM REVIEW: Maren Morris makes life a ‘Humble Quest’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Maren Morris made her name in country music the same way many do, singing about trucks, bad boys and getting drunk with friends.
On Humble Quest we find a humbled Maren Morris, more observant and personal than ever before.
“Hummingbird, hummingbird/ You’re the sound of these strings,” she sings in one of the album’s strongest choruses.
Another stark difference on Humble Quest and Morris’ previous releases was the loss of her producer Michael Busbee, who died of cancer in 2019.
Morris, Hurd and friend Jon Green wrote album closer “What Would This World Do?” before Busbee’s death, while they still had hope he’d pull through.
