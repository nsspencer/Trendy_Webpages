     Five Thoughts On The Claude Giroux Trade For The Panthers and Flyers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Florida Panthers and the Philadelphia Flyers made a big trade on Saturday when the Flyers sent Claude Giroux, German Rubtsov, and a fifth-round pick in 2024 to the Panthers in exchange for Owen Tippett, a first-round pick (either in 2024 or 2025), and a third-round pick in 2023.
Claude Giroux is leaving the Philadelphia Flyers and heading to the Florida Panthers for a playoff run.
The Florida Panthers haven’t been true contenders for a long long time.
Despite how bad the Flyers have been, now former-captain Claude Giroux has been having a great season.
A Fresh StartClaude Giroux just recently played in his 1000th game, and now he is on his way to Florida to play with the Panthers.

     Philadelphia Flyers: The Claude Giroux trade ends an era
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia Flyers were a big part of my 1990s sports fandom.
Throughout the decade, they were routinely competing for a Stanley Cup.
The club had an exciting run all the way to the Stanley Cup.
Only a few years later, he was named team captain and a new era at the Wells Fargo Center officially began.
Claude Giroux was not the problem with the Philadelphia Flyers during his time as team captain.

     Florida Panthers acquire Flyers captain Claude Giroux; trade for Sabres defenseman Robert Hagg
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The team watched Joel Quenneville step down as coach seven unbeaten games into the season as part of the fallout from the Chicago Blackhawks’ scandal involving an abused player — something that happened when Quenneville coached there more than a decade ago.
And on Friday, the team watched as top defenseman Aaron Ekblad crawled to the bench in agony after enduring a lower-leg injury in Anaheim.
But by night’s end the team already had enough information to believe Ekblad dodged the sort of significant injury that likely would have ended his season and put a huge dent in Florida’s title hopes.

It will be a 2024 first-round pick unless it turns out to be a top-10 pick, then it is transferred to a 2025 first-round pick.
Management did what they could and got a return for Giroux instead of letting him walk for nothing in free agency.
