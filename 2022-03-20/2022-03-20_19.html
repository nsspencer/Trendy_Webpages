The result means City remain active in two cup competitions -- the Champions League and FA Cup -- as well as leading the Premier League heading into the business end of the season.
Riyad Mahrez completed the rout in the 79th minute, turning in a Joao Cancelo cross to cap off a free-flowing attacking move from City.

That approach even got to De Bruyne whose misjudgment allowed James Ward-Prowse to force a good save from Steffen.
Che Adams, on for Armstrong should have equalised but thumped a shot straight at Steffen and that was as good as it got for Saints.
Foden put clear water between the two sides with a thunderous 20-yard strike on 75 minutes before fellow substitute Mahrez beat Forster with a clever low shot three minutes later.
