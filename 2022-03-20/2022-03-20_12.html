     Summary: But they did a great job, and Lauren Jensen was here last year, obviously that's an incredible storyline.
She is a really, really good kid.
Lastly, I'll say I do believe that that game was called differently than what we've seen all year, and I really think that's unfortunate.
I think that's really all you can use it as.
I think that's how I'm going to play really if we're winning, we're losing, I'm playing good, I'm playing bad.
