     How to watch the confirmation hearings for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Washington (CNN) Confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will begin Monday, with Democratic leaders setting a goal of reaching a final Senate vote by early April.
If the historic nomination process is successful, Jackson will be the first Black woman to serve on the nation's highest court.
She will be formally introduced Monday after opening statements during televised hearings, followed by two days of questioning and one day of testimony from additional witnesses.
Jackson, 51, currently sits on DC's federal appellate court and had been considered the front-runner for the vacancy since Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement in January.
President Joe Biden , who vowed during the 2020 campaign to select a Black woman to the Supreme Court should a vacancy arise, has already elevated Jackson once, appointing her last year to the appeals court in DC, which is considered the second most powerful federal court in the country.

     Ketanji Brown Jackson hearings begin – could Republicans sink her chances?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Monday’s hearing will be devoted to opening statements from Jackson and from the committee’s 22 senators, who are evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.
In nominating Jackson, Biden honoured the pledge he made during the 2020 presidential election campaign to pick a Black woman for the court.
Leading Republicans have attempted to use Biden’s selection of a Black woman as a stick with which to beat him.
She is unusual among candidates for the supreme court to have had experience as a public defender representing criminal defendants.
That court has been labelled the “second highest court in the land” because so many supreme court justices have been plucked from there.

     At Harvard, Ketanji Brown Jackson Fought Injustices but Kept a Steely Academic Focus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One involved a professor who sued the Environmental Protection Agency over a Freedom of Information Act request.
Another challenged the Department of Education’s campus sexual assault rules, to which Harvard was reviewing its own response.
But Mr. Turley said in an interview that his belief that Judge Jackson should recuse herself has nothing to do with her race.
“Most citizens would be taken aback by a judge, let alone a justice, voting on a case on a university on which she sat on a governing board,” he said.
“It would be akin to a justice ruling on an Exxon lease dispute after being on an Exxon board.”

     Summary: Ketanji Brown Jackson's long judicial record is likely to be scrutinized at hearingstoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe Thesaurus has no synonyms for the phrase, "confirmation hearing."
And beast because when it comes to a Supreme Court nomination, it is treacherous for the nominee, while offering enormous opportunities for her questioners.
Keep that in mind as the Senate Judiciary Committee opens hearings Monday on the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Still, the Senate does have the constitutional authority, and duty, to advise and consent to Supreme Court nominations.
An Unrevealing Judicial RecordBut conservative libertarian Erik Jaffe, policy director of a First Amendment advocacy group, counters that Judge Jackson's record isn't much help because the job of a district court judge is to follow precedent.
