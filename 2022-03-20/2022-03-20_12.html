“It’s a club I’m really comfortable with and it sets up well for me.
I’m not one to change much.
Having the comfort level and seeing good results with it would make it hard to switch.”

    </h2>

     Summary: PALM HARBOR, Fla. -- Sam Burns celebrated another victory Sunday at the Valspar Championship, and it was nothing like he experienced a year ago.
Burns capped off his back-to-back wins at Innisbrook with a birdie putt from just outside 30 feet to beat PGA Tour rookie and longtime friend Davis Riley on the second playoff hole.
One hole later, Burns made a 15-foot birdie putt and Thomas suddenly was four shots behind.
He made all pars until a 12-foot birdie putt on the 17th.
But he steadied himself with a 50-foot birdie putt from the fringe on No.

     Summary: PALM HARBOR, Fla. – Sam Burns has been a great putter for a long, long time.
Riley figures he and Burns, both 25, met one another playing AJGA events when they were 11 or 12.
Burns shot 2-under 69 on Sunday, his eighth consecutive round in the 60s on the daunting Copperhead.
Riley tumbled three shots down the board, to 15 under, and suddenly the lead was handed to three players at 16 under: Burns, Thomas and NeSmith.
“I wasn’t rooting against him,” Burns said, describing his emotions as he stood and watched Riley settle over a potential game-winning putt.
