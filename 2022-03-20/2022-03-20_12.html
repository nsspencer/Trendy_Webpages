     Maury Povich Retires, Ending a 31-Season Run of Revealing Who Is the Father
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Get those paternity tests in now, because “Maury” won’t help you find out whether you’re the father beyond this September.
Maury Povich is ending his run and retiring after 24 seasons of hosting “Maury” for NBCUniversal Syndication Studios (and its predecessors) — and seven seasons before that at Paramount Domestic Television, where it was titled “The Maury Povich Show.” Most recently, NBCU had renewed “Maury” in February 2020 for two more seasons in national syndication, bringing it through 2022.
Povich’s exit comes as NBCU also ends another first-run syndicated series, “Judge Jerry,” hosted by Jerry Springer, after three seasons.
And the daytime talk landscape is being remade as “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” “Nick Cannon” and “The Wendy Williams Show” all say farewell.
He left the show in 1990, launching “The Maury Povich Show” the following year.
