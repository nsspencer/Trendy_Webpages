     Ketanji Brown Jackson hearings begin – could Republicans sink her chances?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Monday’s hearing will be devoted to opening statements from Jackson and from the committee’s 22 senators, who are evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.
In nominating Jackson, Biden honoured the pledge he made during the 2020 presidential election campaign to pick a Black woman for the court.
Leading Republicans have attempted to use Biden’s selection of a Black woman as a stick with which to beat him.
She is unusual among candidates for the supreme court to have had experience as a public defender representing criminal defendants.
That court has been labelled the “second highest court in the land” because so many supreme court justices have been plucked from there.

     Fact check: Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson child porn sentences ‘pretty mainstream’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "In every single child porn case for which we can find records, Judge Jackson deviated from the federal sentencing guidelines in favor of child porn offenders," Hawley tweeted Thursday, highlighting nine cases from her time as a district court judge.
Berman also points out that government prosecutors often request below-range sentences, including in most of the Jackson cases that Hawley cited.
District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump-appointee who served alongside Judge Jackson on the U.S.
Sentencing Commission for a time, also issued below-guidelines sentences in at least four child porn cases, records show.
Judge Jackson has been scrutinized more than any person I can think of.

     Op-Ed: The sickening Republican smear campaign against Ketanji Brown Jackson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fight over the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for the Supreme Court is powerful evidence that our political system is broken like never before.
That Jackson will be the first public defender to be a Supreme Court justice should be celebrated, not attacked.
It was not that long ago that impeccably qualified Supreme Court nominees were easily confirmed with bipartisan support.
Republicans may see this as “payback” for the Democratic opposition to President Trump’s nominees for the Supreme Court.
He is the author most recently of “Presumed Guilty: How the Supreme Court Empowered the Police and Subverted Civil Rights.”

     Confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson begin Monday. Here's what to expect
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson begin Monday.
Democrats are hoping to finish Jackson's confirmation process before Congress leaves for Easter recess April 11.
The hearings, led by the Senate Judiciary Committee, is set to last four days, with Jackson appearing in front of lawmakers during the first three.
Though the confirmation process used to be seen as more of a cross-party effort, it's morphed into a contentious and fiercely partisan process.
Graham is choosing to stay fairly silent – a change from his vocal opposition on the day Jackson's nomination was announced.

     Summary: (CNN) Like most every other nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has been participating behind closed doors in so-called "moot court" sessions to prepare for her upcoming hearings, according to a source familiar.
"Judge Jackson has been scrutinized more than any person I can think of.
Out of the gate, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas asked her if she had "ever represented a terrorist at Guantanamo Bay."
Another was Judge Dabney L. Friedrich whom Trump went on to nominate to United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas lamented "skyrocketing crime rates, skyrocketing burglary rates, and skyrocketing carjacking rates."
