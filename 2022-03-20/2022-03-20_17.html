I’m not one to change much.
Having the comfort level and seeing good results with it would make it hard to switch.”

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PALM HARBOR, Fla. -- Sam Burns celebrated another victory Sunday at the Valspar Championship, and it was nothing like he experienced a year ago.
Burns capped off his back-to-back wins at Innisbrook with a birdie putt from just outside 30 feet to beat PGA Tour rookie and longtime friend Davis Riley on the second playoff hole.
Riley, who started the final round with a two-shot lead and closed with a 72, had a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th for a win.
One hole later, Burns made a 15-foot birdie putt and Thomas suddenly was four shots behind.
But he steadied himself with a 50-foot birdie putt from the fringe on No.
