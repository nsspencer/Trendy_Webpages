     U.S. Capitol riot probe to reveal new details on attack, Cheney says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Richard CowanWASHINGTON (Reuters) – The U.S. Congress’ probe of the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol will reveal new details of that day’s events and may recommend new criminal penalties for officials who fail to uphold their duties, Representative Liz Cheney said on Sunday.
Trump has been openly flirting with the possibility of running again in 2024 at a series of rallies.
Cheney and Representative Adam Kinzinger, who also serves on the special committee, were among the only 10 Republicans who voted early last year to impeach Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 attack.
One police officer who battled rioters on Jan. 6 died the day after the attack and four who guarded the Capitol later died by suicide.
Four rioters also died, including a woman who was shot by a police officer while trying to climb through a shattered window.

     Summary: Liz Cheney, one of two Republicans on the January 6 committee, does not regret her vote against Donald Trump’s first impeachment, for withholding military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to extract dirt on rivals including Joe Biden.
But Cheney also said on Sunday she was focused on lessons learned from that impeachment as she pursues the investigation of the deadly Capitol attack, the event which led to Trump’s second Senate trial.
Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, the other Republican on the January 6 panel, were among 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump second time round, for inciting an insurrection.
Kinzinger has said that in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he regrets backing Trump in his first impeachment.
In an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press, Cheney was asked about her vote against impeachment on Ukraine.

     Summary: In previous decades, a Republican risked getting tagged as a RINO for supporting tax increases, gun control or abortion rights.
Today, in a reflection of the GOP’s murkier ideological grounding in the Trump era, it’s a term reserved almost exclusively for lack of fealty to Trump.
During just the past six months, the list of Republicans Trump has branded with the term includes Arizona Gov.
Brian Kemp a “RINO governor.”The term is now so ubiquitous, said James Dickey, the former chair of the Texas Republican Party, that it’s suffering from overuse.
Republican primary voters are anesthetized to that,” he said.

“The America First foreign policy has made a lot of inroads,” she said in an interview.
Starting with his 2016 campaign, Trump embraced a more isolationist strain in American foreign policy thinking that went back to the nation’s founding.
The organizer, Nicholas Fuentes, is a white nationalist activist who, before introducing Greene, urged support for Putin in the war with Ukraine.
If Putin conquers Ukraine, an emboldened Russia might then carry the war to neighboring NATO countries, setting off a direct clash between nuclear-armed nations.
