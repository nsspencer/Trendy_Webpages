     THE MORNING AFTER: Avalanche Fans Still Pinching Themselves (+)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yes, what you thought you saw last night really did happen.
Darren Helm really did score with 5.6 seconds left in regulation to put the Colorado Avalanche into the Western Conference finals.
That not only broke an 0-3 streak the previous three years in the second round, it broke an overall streak of 0-6 in the second round, dating back to 2002 (Detroit 2008, Anaheim 2006, San Jose 2004).
Twenty years of frustration, gone with one swing of Helm’s stick.
Let’s talk a little more about last night, specifically that save by Josh Manson in the second period of a 2-1 Blues lead, on Jordan Kyrou.
