     Summary: Giants slugger Joc Pederson detailed what led to his altercation with Reds outfielder Tommy Pham on Friday, explaining that the spat was indeed the result of a fantasy football disagreement.
As the Giants warmed up in the outfield, Pham confronted Pederson and slapped him in the cheek before the pair was eventually separated.
He kind of came up and said, like, I don’t know if you remember from last year and I was like fantasy football.
He was like, yeah.”Pederson said that Pham accused him of cheating in a fantasy football league that both MLB players were participating in by placing a player on injured reserve and replacing him with a fantasy football free agent.
Pham did not agree, despite supposedly executing a similar swap within his own fantasy football team.

     Summary: Reds outfielder Tommy Pham told reporters (including The Cincinnati Enquirer’s Charlie Goldsmith) that he has been issued a three-game suspension for an altercation with the Giants’ Joc Pederson prior to last night’s game.
The suspension began with last night’s contest, so Pham will miss the entirety of the Reds’ series with San Francisco.
The league has officially announced the suspension, adding that Pham has also been issued a fine.
“I didn’t like that, and I didn’t like the sketchy shit going on in the fantasy league.
We’ve got too much money on the line, and I look at it like there’s a code,” Pham said.
