     A hurricane watch is in effect for Mexico as Tropical Storm Agatha forms in the eastern Pacific
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Tropical Storm Agatha has formed to become the first storm of the 2022 eastern Pacific hurricane season.
The storm is forecast to gradually strengthen, becoming a hurricane on Sunday before making landfall over the southern coast of Mexico on Monday.
Mexico has issued a hurricane watch for the southern coast from Salina Cruz to Punta Maldonado.
"Storm surge could produce coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore winds," the National Hurricane Center said.
In addition to storm surge, heavy rains from Agatha will hit portions of southern Mexico by Sunday into Tuesday night.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Agatha continued to strengthen and is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday and head towards land.
On Saturday evening, the center of the tropical storm was located about 175 miles (280 kilometers) southwest of Puerto Angel, with winds of 60 mph (95 kph).

     Tropical Storm Agatha expected to become "potentially life-threatening" hurricane off Mexico's Pacific coast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Agatha, the first tropical storm of the 2022 hurricane season in the Pacific, formed Saturday off Mexico's southern coast.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Agatha is expected to become a hurricane and head towards land, adding that the storm could produce "potentially life-threatening" floods and mudslides.
Tropical Storm Agatha is seen off Mexico's Pacific coast on May 28, 2022, in this NOAA satellite image.
Earlier this week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a below-normal 2022 season for hurricanes in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
This hurricane season — which starts June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 — could be the seventh consecutively above-average hurricane season, according to the NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.
