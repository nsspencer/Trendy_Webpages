     Woman Gets 15 Months in Prison for Punching Flight Attendant in the Face
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A California woman who repeatedly punched a Southwest Airlines flight attendant last year, bloodying her face and chipping three of her teeth, was sentenced on Friday to 15 months in federal prison, prosecutors said.
The woman, Vyvianna M. Quinonez, 29, of Sacramento, will also have to pay nearly $26,000 in restitution and a $7,500 fine, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California.
A video of the attack, which occurred in May 2021, was widely viewed on social media.
The assault came amid a surge of unruly and violent behavior by passengers who shoved, struck and yelled at flight attendants.
Within days of the attack, two major airlines, American and Southwest, postponed plans to begin serving alcohol again on flights, in an effort to stop the behavior.
