     Depth got Avalanche over second-round hump vs. Blues, and could play even bigger role vs. Edmonton: “If we’re going to win, we need everybody.”
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Having the depth Colorado has displayed thus far during the postseason is a recipe for success in a seven-game series.
“If we’re going to win, we need everybody,” MacKinnon said after getting Colorado past the second round for the first time in four tries.
Shutdown defenseman Josh Manson had never scored a postseason goal until he won Game 1 in overtime, and Helm, the fourth-line center, won Game 6 in the final seconds of regulation.
“We need depth and everyone’s chipping in right now.”MacKinnon was the star in a losing effort in Game 5, where he had three goals and an assist.
Helm won the Stanley Cup with Detroit as a rookie in 2008.

Darren Helm really did score with 5.6 seconds left in regulation to put the Colorado Avalanche into the Western Conference finals.
That not only broke an 0-3 streak the previous three years in the second round, it broke an overall streak of 0-6 in the second round, dating back to 2002 (Detroit 2008, Anaheim 2006, San Jose 2004).
Twenty years of frustration, gone with one swing of Helm’s stick.

     Nathan MacKinnon, evolved: Avalanche star showing his maturity, embracing playoff journey
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Avalanche star didn’t want any of that to happen again, especially knowing the talent on Colorado’s roster.
Late in one 2019 Avalanche defeat, MacKinnon lost his composure on the bench, spiking his green Gatorade water bottle and snapping at coach Jared Bednar.
The Blues captain and former Avalanche player is one of the top defensive forwards in the league, and he won the Conn Smythe and Selke trophies in 2019.
MacKinnon, the third-longest-tenured Avalanche player, lived up to his billing as the face of the franchise, showing he can dominate when the moment is most intense.
He spent a lot of time watching the Avalanche play in their own offensive zone and faced only 26.2 shots per game in Round 2.
