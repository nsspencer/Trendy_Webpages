     ‘Yeah, That Happened.’ A Giants Player Is Slapped Over Fantasy Football.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When fights occur in professional sports it can sometimes take years for the facts to come out.
Rumors will swirl, tidbits will be attributed to anonymous sources and years later the people involved will finally explain what happened.
In the case of Friday’s slap heard around baseball, though, fans just had to wait for Joc Pederson to get to the clubhouse after the San Francisco Giants’ 5-1 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Friday.
Pederson, an outfielder for the Giants, confirmed what The Athletic had reported and social media had been buzzing about: Tommy Pham, an outfielder for the Reds, had slapped him before the game over a fantasy football transaction that Pederson says he made more than a year ago.
No, really.

     Tommy Pham Says He’s Been Suspended After Slapping Joc Pederson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Friday night, Reds outfielder Tommy Pham slapped Giants outfielder Joc Pederson over a fantasy football argument, and that is going to cost him.
Pham told media before Saturday’s game that he and MLB agreed to a three-game suspension as a punishment.
Pederson explained the fantasy football dispute revolves around whether or not he properly put Jeff Wilson on Injured Reserve during one week.
“He was messing with my money,” Pham said, via Evan Webeck of the Mercury News.
The Reds outfielder revealed that Pederson said something “disrespectful” about the Padres in a text, something that didn’t sit well with him.

     Joc Pederson shares hilarious GIF that caused Tommy Pham fantasy football beef
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the Giants’ 3-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Saturday, Pederson confirmed he sent a GIF to the group chat poking fun at the Padres.
The GIF consisted of three weight lifters with Los Angeles Dodgers, Giants and Padres logos superimposed over their faces.
"... Because they were a really good team, so it was kind of making fun of how they were not playing well to make the playoffs with a very talented team."
Pham didn't approve of the joke Pederson, who was playing for the Atlanta Braves at the time, was making.
That means 228 days passed before Pham slapped Pederson across the face at Great American Ball Park.
