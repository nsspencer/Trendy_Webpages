     Details, Reaction To Lakers Choosing Darvin Ham As Head Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The news broke on Friday that the Lakers had chosen Bucks assistant Darvin Ham as their new head coach.
Ham was granted some power before he accepted the job on a four-year contract.
Ham sold the Lakers‚Äô brass with his ability to communicate and hold people accountable.
They were so impressed by Ham that they passed over a planned interview with Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson and offered the Bucks assistant the job.

     Lakers Not Giving Darvin Ham the Frank Vogel Treatment Says LA Insider
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Frank Vogel was fired almost immediately after the regular season ended for the Lakers.
Now, LA has a new head coach and they are not messing around this time.
According to Bill Oram from the Athletic, the Lakers are allowing new head coach Darvin Ham to have more freedom.
As a first-time head coach, Ham will have a lot on his plate over the offseason and then even more once the regular season starts.
This inevitably led to the Lakers interviewing Frank Vogel and hiring him as the head coach for LA.

     Summary: How can new coach Darvin Ham help the Los Angeles Lakers get back in NBA title contention?
Ham came with Mike Budenholzer to Milwaukee from the Atlanta Hawks and was part of the Bucks' overnight development into contenders, culminating in the 2021 title.
Undoubtedly, the Lakers' problems began with a deeply flawed roster following last summer's trade for guard Russell Westbrook.
And how can the Lakers' front office put their new coach in better position to succeed than Vogel?

But considering his tongue-in-cheek comments about Los Angeles ‚Äúnot being‚Äù for him and the loyalty he‚Äôs shown to Milwaukee, this will not be an article about Giannis‚Äô future.
