     Tommy Pham suspended 3 games, says slap was over fantasy football and 'disrespectful' text
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tommy Pham was suspended for three games, retroactive to Friday, after he slapped San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson during Friday’s batting practice.
"Because they were a really good team, so it was kind of making fun of how they were not playing well to make the playoffs with a very talented team," Pederson said.
In the fantasy football league, Pederson said he was accused of cheating in a group text when he put a player on his injured reserve after the player was listed as out.
During Friday’s batting practice, Pham walked up to Pederson, told him he didn’t forget about what happened in their fantasy league and slapped him across the face.
He should’ve known right then and there.”The fantasy football league featured MLB players from various teams, including Mike Moustakas, Pham said.

     Summary: Cincinnati Reds outfielder Tommy Pham received a three-game suspension after slapping San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson before Friday's game, Major League Baseball announced Saturday.
Pederson, after Friday's game, confirmed he sent a gif to Pham and others in the text chat that "was meant to be all fun and games."
I didn't like that and I didn't like the sketchy shit going on in the fantasy," Pham said on Saturday.
Pham and Pederson played in the same fantasy football league in 2021, Pham said.
There was "a lot of money" on the line in the league, Pham said.

     Summary: But, if there's one way not to settle your Fantasy league disputes, it's how Tommy Pham approached it this week.
If you haven't heard by now, Pham slapped Joc Pederson prior to Friday's game between the Reds and Giants, in a dispute stemming from their Fantasy football league.
You should not, in fact, slap people because they sent silly GIFs to your Fantasy league group text.
Apparently, there was some disagreement about the way IR spots were used, and it comes down to a limitation in how IR spots work in many leagues.
In this case, the IR in your Fantasy league should serve the same function it does in the real NFL.

     Summary: CINCINNATI (AP) — Cincinnati Reds outfielder Tommy Pham was suspended by Major League Baseball for three games Saturday after he slapped San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson because of a dispute about their fantasy football league.
While the Giants warmed up in the outfield before Friday's series opener, Pham confronted Pederson and smacked him in the face before the pair was separated.
Pham said Saturday there was some “sketchy” stuff going on with the fantasy league, and Pederson also made “disrespectful” comments about Pham's former team, the San Diego Padres.
Pederson was with the Atlanta Braves at the time, and Pham was playing for San Diego.
“Like I said, it is true I did send a GIF making fun of the Padres and if I hurt anyone’s feelings, I apologize for that.

Video of the incident showed Pham hitting Pederson with such force that he knocked the latter’s sunglasses off.
