     Joc Pederson Pulls Out Receipts of Group Text Exchange With Tommy Pham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Giants outfielder Joc Pederson offered his side of the story Saturday after his fantasy football dispute with Reds outfielder Tommy Pham came to light following a confrontation prior to Friday’s game against the Reds.
Pham was scratched from the contest after reportedly slapping the Giants outfielder over a disagreement the two had in a fantasy football league last year.
Pederson said the exchange began after he shared a GIF making fun of the Padres, which elicited a reply from Pham.
“Joc I don’t know you well enough to make any jokes like this,” Pham said, per Pederson.
Pederson told reporters the GIF was intended to be “light-hearted” and he did not mean to offend anyone.

     Tommy Pham suspended 3 games, says slap was over fantasy football and 'disrespectful' text
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tommy Pham was suspended for three games, retroactive to Friday, after he slapped San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson during Friday’s batting practice.
"Because they were a really good team, so it was kind of making fun of how they were not playing well to make the playoffs with a very talented team," Pederson said.
In the fantasy football league, Pederson said he was accused of cheating in a group text when he put a player on his injured reserve after the player was listed as out.
During Friday’s batting practice, Pham walked up to Pederson, told him he didn’t forget about what happened in their fantasy league and slapped him across the face.
He should’ve known right then and there.”The fantasy football league featured MLB players from various teams, including Mike Moustakas, Pham said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI (AP) — Cincinnati Reds outfielder Tommy Pham was suspended by Major League Baseball for three games Saturday after he slapped San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson because of a dispute about their fantasy football league.
While the Giants warmed up in the outfield before Friday's series opener, Pham confronted Pederson and smacked him in the face before the pair was separated.
Pham said Saturday there was some “sketchy” stuff going on with the fantasy league, and Pederson also made “disrespectful” comments about Pham's former team, the San Diego Padres.
Pederson was with the Atlanta Braves at the time, and Pham was playing for San Diego.
“Like I said, it is true I did send a GIF making fun of the Padres and if I hurt anyone’s feelings, I apologize for that.
