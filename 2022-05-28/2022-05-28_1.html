     Joc Pederson shares hilarious GIF that caused Tommy Pham fantasy football beef
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the Giants’ 3-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Saturday, Pederson confirmed he sent a GIF to the group chat poking fun at the Padres.
The GIF consisted of three weight lifters with Los Angeles Dodgers, Giants and Padres logos superimposed over their faces.
"... Because they were a really good team, so it was kind of making fun of how they were not playing well to make the playoffs with a very talented team."
Pham didn't approve of the joke Pederson, who was playing for the Atlanta Braves at the time, was making.
That means 228 days passed before Pham slapped Pederson across the face at Great American Ball Park.

     Reds' Tommy Pham accepts three-game ban for 'Will Smith-style' slap on Joc Pederson over Fantasy Football
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cincinnati Reds outfielder Tommy Pham has been suspended three games and fined an undisclosed amount by MLB for "inappropriate conduct" prior to Friday night's game against the San Francisco Giants.
Pham says he has accepted a three-game suspension that resulted from his dispute with Joc Pederson of the Giants.
The suspension began with Friday night's game and will span the final two games of the weekend series between the Giants and Reds at Cincinnati.
Pham allegedly slapped Pederson "Will Smith-style" because of a dispute within a Fantasy Football league in which the two players participated.
In 42 games for Cincinnati, he's batted .233/.335/.373 (92 OPS+) with five home runs and 24 walks.

     Summary: Tommy Pham was suspended for three games, retroactive to Friday, after he slapped San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson during Friday’s batting practice.
"Because they were a really good team, so it was kind of making fun of how they were not playing well to make the playoffs with a very talented team," Pederson said.
In the fantasy football league, Pederson said he was accused of cheating in a group text when he put a player on his injured reserve after the player was listed as out.
During Friday’s batting practice, Pham walked up to Pederson, told him he didn’t forget about what happened in their fantasy league and slapped him across the face.
He should’ve known right then and there.”The fantasy football league featured MLB players from various teams, including Mike Moustakas, Pham said.

     Summary: CINCINNATI (AP) — Cincinnati Reds outfielder Tommy Pham was suspended by Major League Baseball for three games Saturday after he slapped San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson because of a dispute about their fantasy football league.
While the Giants warmed up in the outfield before Friday's series opener, Pham confronted Pederson and smacked him in the face before the pair was separated.
Pham said Saturday there was some “sketchy” stuff going on with the fantasy league, and Pederson also made “disrespectful” comments about Pham's former team, the San Diego Padres.
Pederson was with the Atlanta Braves at the time, and Pham was playing for San Diego.
“Like I said, it is true I did send a GIF making fun of the Padres and if I hurt anyone’s feelings, I apologize for that.
