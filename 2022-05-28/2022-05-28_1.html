     Reds' Tommy Pham accepts three-game ban for 'Will Smith-style' slap on Joc Pederson over Fantasy Football
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cincinnati Reds outfielder Tommy Pham has been suspended three games and fined an undisclosed amount by MLB for "inappropriate conduct" prior to Friday night's game against the San Francisco Giants.
Pham says he has accepted a three-game suspension that resulted from his dispute with Joc Pederson of the Giants.
The suspension began with Friday night's game and will span the final two games of the weekend series between the Giants and Reds at Cincinnati.
Pham allegedly slapped Pederson "Will Smith-style" because of a dispute within a Fantasy Football league in which the two players participated.
In 42 games for Cincinnati, he's batted .233/.335/.373 (92 OPS+) with five home runs and 24 walks.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Friday night, Reds outfielder Tommy Pham slapped Giants outfielder Joc Pederson over a fantasy football argument, and that is going to cost him.
Pham told media before Saturday’s game that he and MLB agreed to a three-game suspension as a punishment.

“He was messing with my money,” Pham said, via Evan Webeck of the Mercury News.
The Reds outfielder revealed that Pederson said something “disrespectful” about the Padres in a text, something that didn’t sit well with him.
