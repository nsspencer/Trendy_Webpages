     Camila Cabello Opens Champions League Final as Fans are Pepper Sprayed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Camila Cabello put on a great performance before the UEFA Champions League Final this weekend -- pristine in presentation ... but exactly the opposite of what was unfolding outside.
Some of these videos are absolutely insane -- people are climbing over each other and risking it all just for a chance to get inside.
Unclear if these are people who purchased tickets and were turned away, or if they're simply hooligans trying to take it in for free.
Even the cops themselves were trying to wipe the residue from their eyes ... that's how much they fired off, it seems.
Also, Euro soccer fans are low-key bonkers for the beautiful game.
