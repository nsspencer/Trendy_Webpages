     Summary: San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson says he was slapped in the face by Cincinnati Reds outfielder Tommy Pham during batting practice before Friday night’s game over a fantasy football league disagreement.
"He kinda came up and said, 'You remember from last year?’ And I was like, ‘fantasy football?’ and he was like, ‘Yeah.’"Pederson explained the disagreement happened well over a year ago over a fantasy league the two were in.

Pham allegedly struck Pederson in the left cheek, but Pederson said he didn't react.
I don’t think violence is the answer, I guess you could say … It was an unfortunate situation over a fantasy football rule.

     Giants’ Joc Pederson Explains Fantasy Football Beef With Tommy Pham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Giants slugger Joc Pederson detailed what led to his altercation with Reds outfielder Tommy Pham on Friday, explaining that the spat was indeed the result of a fantasy football disagreement.
As the Giants warmed up in the outfield, Pham confronted Pederson and slapped him in the cheek before the pair was eventually separated.
He kind of came up and said, like, I don’t know if you remember from last year and I was like fantasy football.
He was like, yeah.”Pederson said that Pham accused him of cheating in a fantasy football league that both MLB players were participating in by placing a player on injured reserve and replacing him with a fantasy football free agent.
Pham did not agree, despite supposedly executing a similar swap within his own fantasy football team.

     Joc Pederson thinks Tommy Pham's slap of his face was their first in-person interaction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Pederson said he didn't ever remember chatting with Pham face-to-face before Friday - which is surprising.
In March 2020, both Pham and Pederson were among several MLB players on hand for a Pujols Family Foundation event at Topgolf in Scottsdale.
Photos from each player's Instagram:Pham only played in 31 games for the Padres in 2020, and Pederson only played in 43 games that season for Los Angeles.
In 2021, Pham and Pederson played in all six games in which the Padres faced the Cubs before Pederson was traded in July to the Atlanta Braves.
After Friday's incident, Pham agreed - per the Reds - not to play in the game, a 5-1 Reds win.

     Summary: Prior to Friday night's game in Cincinnati, reports surfaced that there was an on-field altercation between Giants outfielder Joc Pederson and Reds outfielder Tommy Pham.
Apparently, Pham slapped Pederson and the issue stems from a Fantasy Football league.
Yes, both the Reds and Giants beat writers from The Athletic report that the problem between Pham and Pederson arose in a Fantasy Football league that includes several players from many different MLB teams.
In less serious matters, we need to examine the Fantasy Football component here.
Still, no one should still be playing meaningful Fantasy Football in the last week of the NFL regular season.
