     Details, Reaction To Lakers Choosing Darvin Ham As Head Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The news broke on Friday that the Lakers had chosen Bucks assistant Darvin Ham as their new head coach.
Ham was granted some power before he accepted the job on a four-year contract.
Ham sold the Lakers‚Äô brass with his ability to communicate and hold people accountable.
They were so impressed by Ham that they passed over a planned interview with Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson and offered the Bucks assistant the job.

     What the head-coaching move means for LeBron James, Russell Westbrook and Los Angeles' NBA title hopes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: How can new coach Darvin Ham help the Los Angeles Lakers get back in NBA title contention?
Ham came with Mike Budenholzer to Milwaukee from the Atlanta Hawks and was part of the Bucks' overnight development into contenders, culminating in the 2021 title.
Undoubtedly, the Lakers' problems began with a deeply flawed roster following last summer's trade for guard Russell Westbrook.
And how can the Lakers' front office put their new coach in better position to succeed than Vogel?

     Summary: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so damn EXCITED,‚Äù LeBron James wrote.
He had no interest in the Lakers eight years ago, and his opinion on the Lakers coach mattered.
That‚Äôs a level of alignment the Lakers sorely need, especially after the malcontented Russell Westbrook revealed just how unhappy he was with Vogel throughout his maiden Lakers season.
Optimism always abounds in the afterglow of a coaching hire.
Won over LeBron James.

     Darvin Ham‚Äôs Biggest Challenge as New Lakers Coach
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In addition, it‚Äôs a reminder for me that coaching was not necessarily the biggest issue for the Lakers last season.
Jim Dedmon/USA TODAY SportsWhat‚Äôs the biggest challenge facing Ham as Lakers coach?
Ham‚Äôs ability to successfully integrate Westbrook into his rotation will likely make or break the Lakers‚Äô season.
If he doesn‚Äôt earn their trust, the team can‚Äôt be put in the best position to succeed.
Even if the trade makes no sense from a value standpoint, the Lakers need to better complement AD and LeBron.
