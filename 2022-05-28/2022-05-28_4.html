     Heat's Tyler Herro: Questionable for Game 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Herro (groin) is questionable for Sunday's Game 7 against the Celtics.
As expected, Herro will continue to be listed as questionable while dealing with a significant groin strain.
He's missed the past three games due to the injury, but the Heat were still able to force a Game 7.
His availability could come down to a game-time call.

     Miami Heat's Tyler Herro (groin strain) out for Game 6; Marcus Smart, Robert Williams available for Boston Celtics
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON -- Heat guard Tyler Herro will not play in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals Friday night because of a strained left groin as Miami tries to stave off elimination against the Boston Celtics.
On the Celtics' side, big man Robert Williams III (left knee soreness) and guard Marcus Smart (right ankle sprain) are available to play as Boston looks to close out the series and set up an NBA Finals matchup against the Golden State Warriors.
"He's definitely made progress, but he's not quite ready, you know, to step into this kind of intensity of a game."
Herro originally injured his groin last Saturday in the Game 3 win by Miami and then missed Games 4 and 5, both Heat losses.
As badly as he wants to get out there, this is the most responsible decision for us."
