     Chicago White Sox finally DFA Dallas Keuchel after horrendous run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier today the Chicago White Sox announced they have designated pitcher Dallas Keuchel for assignment.
White Sox fans should be fine with this move as Danny Mendick is more deserving of a roster spot than Dallas Keuchel at this point.
The Chicago White Sox finally cut ties with Dallas Keuchel as he has been DFA’d.
It is good to see Mendick get called up but the Chicago White Sox should look into calling up Yolbert Sanchez as well.
Dallas Keuchel had a great first season for the Chicago White Sox in 2020 when he posted a 1.99 ERA and finished fifth in Cy Young voting.

     Is This the End of the Road for Dallas Keuchel?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chicago White Sox starter Dallas Keuchel was coming off a four-inning outing against the New York Yankees on May 21 where he gave up six earned runs and got the loss.
Then, things got worse on Thursday against the Boston Red Sox as Keuchel was once again the losing pitcher, giving up six earned in just two innings of work.
That brought the left-hander's ERA on the year to 7.88, the final year of a 3-year, $55.5 million deal that Keuchel signed with the White Sox before the 2020 season.
We're talking about a former Cy Young Award winner in Dallas Keuchel, who won it with the Houston Astros in 2015.
However, it most certainly begs the question about the future of Keuchel in Major League Baseball.

     White Sox designate LHP Dallas Keuchel for assignment
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: APCHICAGO (AP) — Dallas Keuchel gave the Chicago White Sox a boost two years ago, helping a team with an exciting young core reach the playoffs.
He signed a $55.5 million, three-year contract with the White Sox in December 2019.
The White Sox also have Lucas Giolito, Michael Kopech, Dylan Cease and Johnny Cueto in their rotation, and Lance Lynn is coming back from right knee surgery.
The White Sox also recalled infielder Danny Mendick from Triple-A Charlotte before Saturday night's game against the crosstown Cubs.
If he is released, another team could sign him for a prorated share of the $700,000 minimum, with the White Sox responsible for the rest.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: White Sox DFA Dallas Keuchel in season’s first big shake-upAs Dallas Keuchel struggled to tread water, his postgame quotes often reflected reality that only Keuchel could see.
I was really, really feeling like myself in Boston, and then against New York at home, so to take a couple steps back is very frustrating.
And maybe it was, because the White Sox designated Keuchel for assignment this afternoon.
The White Sox avoided splurging on the open market and instead settled for guys who couldn’t demand nine figures for considerable reasons.
PERTINENT: Dallas Keuchel isn’t White Sox’s biggest problem, but he’s an emblematic oneThe White Sox have an off day on Monday to rearrange their rotation accordingly, so we’ll see how the White Sox deploy or delay the next man up.

     White Sox were ready to cut ties with Dallas Keuchel, but other moves won’t be as simple
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A month before the White Sox signed Dallas Keuchel to a three-year deal to shore up the front of the rotation, their five-year, nine-figure offer to Zack Wheeler was bypassed as he chose to join the Phillies.
He would have been a crucial cog in a White Sox rotation that has clearly been recently fortified with alternatives so it could absorb a move like cutting ties with Keuchel — as the team did Saturday.
“Unfortunately the latter half of his White Sox career didn’t pan out the way we had hoped.
— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) May 28, 2022The questions linger because the White Sox, at least so far, are not what they should be this season, and it’s hard to figure what brought them to this point of looking so unfamiliar.
And with the way Keuchel’s production had declined, he certainly did not have to justify the move.
