     Native son Leclerc grabs pole for Monaco Grand Prix
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sports Desk, May 28 (EFE).- Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) was the fastest Saturday around the urban circuit in his home town of Monte Carlo and will start the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix from the pole position.
The fourth row belongs to Spanish two-time champion Fernando Alonso (Alpine) and to Britain’s Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes), holder of a record-tying seven F1 championships.
Germany’s Sebastian Vettel (Aston Martin), a four-time champion, and Frenchman Esteban Ocon (Alpine) complete the top 10.
The extreme difficulty of overtaking on the Monte Carlo circuit increases the value of starting from the front row on the grid.
Verstappen, who currently leads Leclerc in the driver standings by just 6 points, has finished fourth in Monaco on each of the previous occasions when he started from P4.

The car was good all weekend and I think today we showed that we extracted a lot out of the car, and we put in some good laps.
I was just trying to get back into the flow of it in FP3, and then we made a few set-up changes for qualifying.
