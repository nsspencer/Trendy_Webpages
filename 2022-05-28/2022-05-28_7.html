     ‘Yeah, That Happened.’ A Giants Player Is Slapped Over Fantasy Football.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When fights occur in professional sports it can sometimes take years for the facts to come out.
Rumors will swirl, tidbits will be attributed to anonymous sources and years later the people involved will finally explain what happened.
In the case of Friday’s slap heard around baseball, though, fans just had to wait for Joc Pederson to get to the clubhouse after the San Francisco Giants’ 5-1 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Friday.
Pederson, an outfielder for the Giants, confirmed what The Athletic had reported and social media had been buzzing about: Tommy Pham, an outfielder for the Reds, had slapped him before the game over a fantasy football transaction that Pederson says he made more than a year ago.
No, really.

     Joc Pederson shares hilarious GIF that caused Tommy Pham fantasy football beef
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the Giants’ 3-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Saturday, Pederson confirmed he sent a GIF to the group chat poking fun at the Padres.
The GIF consisted of three weight lifters with Los Angeles Dodgers, Giants and Padres logos superimposed over their faces.
"... Because they were a really good team, so it was kind of making fun of how they were not playing well to make the playoffs with a very talented team."
Pham didn't approve of the joke Pederson, who was playing for the Atlanta Braves at the time, was making.
That means 228 days passed before Pham slapped Pederson across the face at Great American Ball Park.

     Joc Pederson Pulls Out Receipts of Group Text Exchange With Tommy Pham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Giants outfielder Joc Pederson offered his side of the story Saturday after his fantasy football dispute with Reds outfielder Tommy Pham came to light following a confrontation prior to Friday’s game against the Reds.
Pham was scratched from the contest after reportedly slapping the Giants outfielder over a disagreement the two had in a fantasy football league last year.
Pederson said the exchange began after he shared a GIF making fun of the Padres, which elicited a reply from Pham.
“Joc I don’t know you well enough to make any jokes like this,” Pham said, per Pederson.
Pederson told reporters the GIF was intended to be “light-hearted” and he did not mean to offend anyone.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While addressing his confrontation over a fantasy football dispute with Giants outfielder Joc Pederson for the first time, Pham broke the news of his three-game suspension, explained why he resorted to physical violence and expressed little remorse.
“Yesterday we were mostly concerned about Joc and making sure he was all right mentally through all this,” Kapler said.
Pham responded, “Joc I don’t know you well enough to make any jokes like this.”Pederson wrote back, “It was meant to be all fun and games.
Pham also said he was “face to face” with Giants pitching coach Andrew Bailey, who was one of the first members of the Giants organization to sprint toward the scene after Pham slapped Pederson.
Pham initially approached Pederson and Martin with Reds outfielder Albert Almora Jr., but the situation escalated to include upward of 30 players and coaches from both teams.

     Joc Pederson vs. Tommy Pham Fantasy football rules dispute: What happened, and how to avoid it in your leagues
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But, if there's one way not to settle your Fantasy league disputes, it's how Tommy Pham approached it this week.
If you haven't heard by now, Pham slapped Joc Pederson prior to Friday's game between the Reds and Giants, in a dispute stemming from their Fantasy football league.
You should not, in fact, slap people because they sent silly GIFs to your Fantasy league group text.
Apparently, there was some disagreement about the way IR spots were used, and it comes down to a limitation in how IR spots work in many leagues.
In this case, the IR in your Fantasy league should serve the same function it does in the real NFL.
