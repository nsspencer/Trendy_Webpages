     Colton Herta cleared to race in Indy 500 after flipping car on Friday
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS -- Colton Herta was cleared to drive in the Indianapolis 500 on Saturday, a day after flipping end over end in a harrowing crash.
The Andretti Autosport driver walked out of the infield care center uninjured but required further evaluation before getting the green light to race Sunday.
Andretti Autosport posted Saturday on Twitter that Herta "has been officially cleared by IndyCar medical" to participate in the 500.
His father is his race strategist and immediately went to the Andretti garage to oversee preparations on the backup car.
Last year, Herta qualified second for the Indy 500, started on the front row and led 13 laps before his strategy backfired and he faded to a disappointing 16th-place finish.

     Summary: A major effort by the #26 Gainbridge crew members and some of their colleagues in the AA team ensured he went back out.
The swift turn around was good enough to earn crew chief Nick Allen this year’s Clint Brawner Award.
But in hot and dense air conditions of the afternoon, Herta could manage a four-lap average speed good enough for only 25th on the grid.
The damage was bad enough that the team has had to build up the backup car for the race.
This has now been done, and Herta has been cleared to drive.

In terms of deciding how to tackle the race tactically, Carpenter again expressed confidence, stating: “It really just depends on how the race is flowing.
All three of our cars were good enough to win last year: we just weren’t at the right spot at the right time for whatever reason.
So I’m excited.”Recalling 2018, when he finished runner-up to Will Power in a Team Penske-Chevrolet, Carpenter said: “It’s hard finishing second.
“Especially now my kids are getting older, they really see and understand that process a little more than they did when they were little.
