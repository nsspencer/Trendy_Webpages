     Summary: For years, Jamal Crawford was the gold standard of NBA reserves.
"Goodbye to the game, all the spoils the adrenaline rush," Crawford said in a tweet posted late Sunday night.
Before he was done, he suited up for the Knicks, Warriors, Hawks, Blazers, Clippers, Timberwolves, Suns and Nets.
Crawford was a full-time NBA reserve at the age of 38 for the Suns.
That would have been an appropriate time to retire, but Crawford still felt he had basketball in him.
