    </h2>

     Summary: The team announced Monday – just hours before the game against UCF – that the game was sold out.
2 seed Huskies, who routed Mercer in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament on Saturday, are 13-0 against the No.
UCF, on the other hand, won its first-ever NCAA Tournament game on Saturday, when the Knights (26-3) beat Florida for the first time in the history of that in-state rivalry.
UCF, which has won 14 straight games, came into the tournament leading the nation in scoring defense, giving up just 47.5 points a game.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Given the kind of season we’ve had, I thought I’d pretty much seen it all,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said.
It was going to be really difficult.
It was going to be really ugly looking, and it was.
And we could have just as easily let that game get away from us and we didn’t.
There’s something to be said for that, that you can win a game that you probably would look back and say ‘I’m not sure how we won that game, but we did.’”
