     Kylie Jenner’s Son Is Already a Baby Sneakerhead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Kylie Jenner/YoutubeThe Kardashian-Jenners never do anything halfway, baby wardrobes included.
On Monday, Kylie Jenner gave fans a peek into her newborn son’s closet, and I did not know this many kinds of baby sneakers existed.
This baby isn’t even 2 months old, but he already has more pairs of shoes than I do.
There are literally five shelves full of baby sneakers and a grand total of 44 individual shoes.
I’m not a mother, but I have to wonder, how many pairs of shoes does a baby really need?
