     All Signs Point To Quiet NHL Trade Deadline For New Jersey Devils
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Jersey Devils have been tied to rumors from everyone to obvious trade candidates in P.K.
To be honest, it just seems like the Devils are going to stand pat at the deadline.
By the time you’re reading this, it’s probably getting intesely close to the trade deadline.
The Devils were already sitting back and letting people contact them at this deadline, but that strategy might not have been the best.
Now, it looks like the Devils will keep Subban until the season ends or they terminate his contract.

     2022 NHL trade deadline winners and losers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 NHL trade deadline has officially come and gone.
On a day that saw nearly 30 deals made — at the time of this writing, anyway — it was quite the chaotic afternoon, even though there were very few blockbusters made.
This year’s trade deadline certainly was much more active than the 2021 deadline, which saw fewer than 20 deals made on deadline day, so it’s fair to say the day went by quite fast.
Even with over half of the league capped out, nearly every single team made some sort of trade or deal by Monday’s 3 p.m. deadline.
Here are our winners and losers from a busy 2022 NHL trade deadline.

     NHL Trade Deadline 2022: Why Coyotes decided to not move Jakob Chychrun, Phil Kessel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NHL trade deadline has come and gone, with a multitude of players getting shipped around the league.
The Coyotes had been shopping both defenseman Jakob Chychrun and forward Phil Kessel, however, both players remain members of the Coyotes organization post-deadline.

The return on a Kessel deal would have been light, but a single draft pick is better than nothing.
