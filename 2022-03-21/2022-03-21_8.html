     Texas and the Southeast Brace for Tornadoes and Heavy Rain
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A strong storm system capable of producing large hail, isolated tornadoes, damaging winds and flooding was forecast to slam the South and Southeast through Tuesday, meteorologists said.
While thunderstorms are common in the region throughout the year, severe weather reaches its peak during March, April and May, according to the National Weather Service.
That system will pull moisture northward over the plains and Mississippi Valley from the Gulf of Mexico.
As of Monday morning, several areas in the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley were under an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms.
The rolling storms could produce frequent lightning, heavy wind gusts, hail, tornadoes and excessive rainfall that could lead to flash flooding, meteorologists said.

     San Antonio under tornado watch in latest NWS update
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Update, 3 p.m.: On Monday, March 21 just after 3 p.m., the National Weather Service office for San Antonio and Austin updated the evening forecast and included all of San Antonio in a tornado watch encompassing multiple Texas cities.
It shows the line of severe weather impacting areas north of San Antonio proper like San Marcos, past Austin, into Killeen, and beyond.
Though the storm looks to be out of San Antonio's way in the model, NWS says the city could still be affected.
Just because it shows storms north of San Antonio DOES NOT MEAN San Antonio is in the clear," the post says.
Most of San Antonio is considered to be at a "slight risk," but eastern parts of Bexar County are at the "enhanced" level.
