     Summary: March 21, 2022 at 10:02 PM EDTMost NHL organizations have at least 30 or so prospects at any given moment.
It amounts to a final haul of 12 picks in this summer’s draft, 13 picks in 2023 and another nine picks in 2024.
The Kraken have five picks in the first two rounds with four coming in the second in this year’s draft.
“The foundation of any successful organization is the draft picks and the prospects they have coming,” Francis said.
“You had teams going into this season with five years of draft picks or potentially 35 players in their system.

     NHL Trade Deadline: What the Fleury, Carpenter Deals Mean for the Blackhawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In all, the Blackhawks acquired four draft picks in three separate trades, including two first-round picks and a second-round pick that could become a first-round pick.
The Blackhawks got deadline day off to a rollicking start by finally agreeing on a trade that sent Marc-Andre Fleury to the Minnesota Wild.
In exchange, the Blackhawks received a conditional second round pick, which could be upgraded to a first-round pick depending on the Wild’s success level in the postseason.
The draft pick the Blackhawks received is for the 2022 NHL Draft, and could become a first-round pick if Fleury wins at least four games and if the Wild advance to at least the Western Conference Final.
In his third season with the Blackhawks, Carpenter has three goals and eight assists in 59 games, and has also tallied 36 penalty minutes.

     Summary: Marc-Andre Fleurymay have been the biggest winner at the NHL trade deadline, getting dealt by the rebuilding Chicago Blackhawks to the potentially contending Minnesota Wild.

The Rangers gave up a total of five picks, including two conditional second-round selections to Winnipeg, along with a pair of minor league prospects.
