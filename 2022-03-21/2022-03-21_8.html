     2022 NHL trade deadline winners and losers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 NHL trade deadline has officially come and gone.
On a day that saw nearly 30 deals made â€” at the time of this writing, anyway â€” it was quite the chaotic afternoon, even though there were very few blockbusters made.
This yearâ€™s trade deadline certainly was much more active than the 2021 deadline, which saw fewer than 20 deals made on deadline day, so itâ€™s fair to say the day went by quite fast.
Even with over half of the league capped out, nearly every single team made some sort of trade or deal by Mondayâ€™s 3 p.m. deadline.
Here are our winners and losers from a busy 2022 NHL trade deadline.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: March 21, 2022 at 4:02 PM EDTSome very quick winner/loser reactions based on what we know as of 4:00 ET:Winner: Wild.
Winner: Avalanche: He didnâ€™t land any of the very biggest names, but Joe Sakic made his team better without overpaying on any of the moves.
Itâ€™s tough to thread the needle with a young team between standing pat completely and giving up too much of the future for short-term gain, but the Rangers managed it well.
A bad team that didnâ€™t do a thing other than double down with some extensions.
Not that it was unexpected, but a team that absolutely has to make the playoffs didnâ€™t (or couldnâ€™t) do a thing.

     All Signs Point To Quiet NHL Trade Deadline For New Jersey Devils
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Jersey Devils have been tied to rumors from everyone to obvious trade candidates in P.K.
To be honest, it just seems like the Devils are going to stand pat at the deadline.
By the time youâ€™re reading this, itâ€™s probably getting intesely close to the trade deadline.
The Devils were already sitting back and letting people contact them at this deadline, but that strategy might not have been the best.
Now, it looks like the Devils will keep Subban until the season ends or they terminate his contract.

     Summary: The NHL trade deadline has come and gone, with a multitude of players getting shipped around the league.
The Coyotes had been shopping both defenseman Jakob Chychrun and forward Phil Kessel, however, both players remain members of the Coyotes organization post-deadline.

The return on a Kessel deal would have been light, but a single draft pick is better than nothing.

     NHL Trade Deadline Winners, Losers: Panthers Stand Out In Loaded East
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They followed that up with an intriguing depth move, swinging a deal for hard-nosed defenseman Jacob Middleton from the San Jose Sharks.
No current Western Conference team has allowed more goals than the Wild, so these two moves should certainly help in that regard.
However, Jeff Gorton and Kent Hughes did all they could in their first deadline calling the shots in Montreal.
The best move might have been maximizing the return for Artturi Lehkonen, getting defense prospect Justin Barron and a 2024 second-round pick back from Colorado.
Detroit didnâ€™t do a ton, but it did well to turn Nick Leddy and Luke Witkowski into two NHLers (Jake Walman, Oskar Sundqvist and a 2023 second-round pick).
