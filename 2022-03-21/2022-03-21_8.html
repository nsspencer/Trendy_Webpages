     Summary: DENVER, CO - JULY 02: Trevor Story #27 of the Colorado Rockies walks through the dugout during a game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Coors Field on July 2, 2021 in Denver, Colorado.
(Photo by Dustin Bradford/Getty Images)Trevor Story was linked to the St. Louis Cardinals, but the team was never seriously going to sign him.
St. Louis Cardinals fans that were bummed about the team not signing Story — don’t be.
As Robert Murray of Redbird Rants writes, the Cardinals were never signing him, despite rumors linking the team to him.
Don’t blame Cardinals for misleading hope on Trevor StoryWhen it comes to St. Louis’ shortstop situation, the team is still going with Paul DeJong at the position.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Story signing improves the Red Sox offensively entering 2022, but raises questions about the infield moving forward.
Beginning with the most pressing, the Red Sox now have multiple premium options at shortstop.
These are good problems for the Red Sox, with positional battles fueling competition between talented ballplayers that will only enhance a bright future in this area of the roster.
The Story signing gives the Red Sox an immediate boost with both his bat and glove in 2022, while offering flexibility in the near future.

On another note, I’d like to leave you with this:Davey replaced Dusty in this job.
These games could be fraught matchup for Dusty and even for the Nats.

(AP Photo/Darryl Webb)Recent Links 4 things to know about new Red Sox star Trevor StoryEven with the excitement around the Red Sox’ signing of former Colorado Rockies star shortstop Trevor Story, the questions remain unavoidable.
Should the Red Sox be forking over $140 million over six years to a guy who apparently can’t hit nearly as well outside of Coors Field?
Fenway Park might not be Coors Field in terms of being hitter-friendly, but it’s the next-best thing.

     Summary: FORT MYERS, Fla. -- The Red Sox’ pending signing of Trevor Story has obvious implications on the team’s infield.
Defensively, we’re better in that aspect.”Entering the winter, the Red Sox seemed pretty set with their outfield, but the Renfroe-for-Bradley swap changed things.
The Red Sox know Bradley’s offensive streakiness better than anyone and hope to get him back on track.
If the Red Sox keep their outfield as it’s currently constructed, they’ll be asking a lot from Bradley on the offensive side of things.
It’s about driving the ball to left center,” Cora said.

     Why Trevor Story’s Colorado Home-Split Concerns Might Be Overstated
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The thin air paired with hitter-friendly Coors has helped produced comical offensive numbers for Rockies and opponents alike in the nearly 30 years Colorado has had a franchise.
It probably should go without saying that 28 home runs, decent run production, solid base-running and good infield defense is still quite valuable, but people are sometimes dumb.
The important thing to remember with Story going to Boston, though, is he now gets to play at Fenway Park.
It’s not like Story is going from Colorado to a pitcher-friendly stadium like we see in San Francisco or Oakland or Detroit.
Just look at this image from Baseball Savant, layering all of Story’s 2021 non-home run batted balls over Fenway Park.

     Scattered thoughts on the Red Sox signing Trevor Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is an opt-out after the fourth season, which the Red Sox can negate if they so choose by adding a seventh year worth $20 million.
This is far and away the biggest move the Red Sox have made this winter, and the biggest they’ve made in a few years, so it’s time to dust off the scattered thoughts format.
I’ve also seen some speculation that the Red Sox could trade Bogaerts before the season.
At the deadline if it seems like he’s going to walk and the Red Sox are out of contention?
I’ve seen some talk about how this affects some of the top prospects in the Red Sox system like Marcelo Mayer and Nick Yorke.
