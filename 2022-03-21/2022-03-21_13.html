     Summary: “It was me in the timeout just talking to them, telling them to keep fighting,” UCF coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson said.
“The game’s not ever; it’s never over.
We’re that kind of team.
We’re a dangerous team when you press like the way we do and the way we play.”

     UConn women’s basketball slugs out tough win over UCF to advance to Sweet Sixteen
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UConn women’s basketball staved off an upset bid from the 7-seed UCF Knights to earn a 52-47 victory and advance to its 28th consecutive Sweet Sixteen.
On the defensive end, the Huskies gave up 18 first quarter points but managed just 12 themselves.
After not taking a single free throw in the opening 10 minutes, UConn started getting to the line in the second quarter with 11 foul shots in the first four minutes.
Out of the break, UConn missed its first three shots which allowed UCF to re-take the lead at 28-26.
With the win, UConn will advance to Bridgeport, where the Huskies will play 3-seed Indiana in the Sweet Sixteen on Saturday.

     UConn women win physical matchup with UCF to lock up spot in record 28th consecutive Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UCF (26-4), meanwhile, concluded a historic season in which it earned its first AAC regular-season and tournament titles and won its first NCAA tournament game, over Florida in the first round.
The Huskies left a slew of points on the board across the contest, making just two of 12 layup attempts.
UConn's 52 points were the fewest it has scored in a NCAA tournament win in program history.
The Knights punched first to go up 17-9, before UConn countered with some edge of its own.
For a team that tends to win with finesse, UConn had no option but to out-tough the Knights if it wanted to advance to Bridgeport.

     The UConn women’s basketball team fought through something ugly to reach Sweet 16
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I think we all have this vision of what toughness is,” Auriemma said.
Last season, Auriemma was home in Manchester with COVID-19 as UConn beat Syracuse by 36 in a second-round game in San Antonio.
The toughness, that’s what we are.
“It was very ugly, but we got the dub and that’s all that matters.”Baylor, the 2 seed in the Wichita Region, lost its second-round game to 10th-seeded South Dakota.
Iowa, the 2 seed in the Greensboro Region, lost its second-round game to 10th-seeded Creighton.
