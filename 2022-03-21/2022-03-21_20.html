     Summary: Following a disappointing 2020 campaign, senior guard Brad Davison decided to utilize his extra year of eligibility granted by the NCAA due to the COVID-19 shortened season.
The team he would be returning to was going to be vastly different from the senior laden roster he played with the previous season.
Nobody was happier to see Davison return than head coach Greg Gard, knowing full well there was nobody that led by example quite like the fifth year senior did.
The impact and influence Davison had on this program will be remembered well after he’s gone.
Thank you, Brad Davison, for five years of unforgettable memories.

     Summary: After an amazing season in which they seemed to defy all the odds, the Wisconsin Badgers fell to the Iowa State Cyclones in March Madness’ round of 32, 54-49.
The Badgers shot a measly 29.8% from the field, shooting 14-47 in the team’s lowest scoring performance of the season.
The lack of scoring costed the Badgers the game and ultimately their season.
He finished with a game-high 22 points, shooting 10-19 from the field, with 14 coming in the second half to put the UW season away.
It truly was a disappointing end to what was such an exciting season.
