     Zach Pascal signs with Eagles, reunites with Nick Sirianni after four seasons with Colts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Zach Pascal, who spent four seasons with the Colts, signed a one-year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday.
Last season, he appeared in 13 games for Indianapolis, with 38 grabs for 384 yards — second-most yards on the team.
He appeared in 64 games over four seasons, catching 150 passes for 1,888 yards and 15 touchdowns.
Pascal struggled against Tampa Bay this season, catching just two passes for 12 yards on seven targets, losing a fumble after a 9-yard reception.
Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni is plenty familiar with Pascal — he was the Colts' offensive coordinator from 2018-2020.

     Summary: Roster Move: Eagles and WR Zach Pascal have agreed to terms on a one-year contract.
@Toyota | #FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/xaHin5mmij — Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) March 21, 2022The Eagles have acquired a vteran wide receiver, as the team announced a one-year deal with former Colts veteran wideout, Zach Pascal.
The former undrafted free agent wide receiver can make plays out of the slot, and he has a history with Nick Sirianni.
In his four years with Indianapolis, Pascal has caught 150 passes for 1,888 yards, and 15 touchdowns, and we’ll give Jalen Hurts a veteran presence that has a history of making plays in the passing game.

     Summary: (AP Photo/AJ Mast) Read moreThe Eagles agreed to sign former Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Zach Pascal to a one-year deal Monday.
Pascal, 27, will be reunited with Eagles coach Nick Sirianni, who was Pascal’s offensive coordinator in Indy for three seasons.
He figures to take Jalen Reagor’s spot as the third wide receiver in a rotation with DeVonta Smith and Quez Watkins.
Pascal was one of the players Sirianni highlighted in his introductory news conference when talking about Colts players he’d formed a special bond with.
The Eagles missed out on market-setting players like wide receiver Christian Kirk and safety Marcus Williams.

     Eagles Sign WR Zach Pascal To One-Year Deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Adam Schefter, the Eagles have signed WR Zach Pascal to a one-year deal.
Pascal, 27, wound up signing a three-year, $1.66 million contract with Washington as an undrafted free agent out of Old Dominion back in 2017.
The Titans signed Pascal to their practice squad and he returned to Tennessee on a futures contract for 2018.
He signed a one-year extension with Indianapolis in 2019 and re-signed as a restricted free agent in 2021.
He was testing the market as an unrestricted free agent this offseason.

     Zach Pascal, Eagles unsurprisingly agree to one-year contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Philadelphia Eagles did exactly as we all expected them to and signed free agent wide receiver Zach Pascal to a one-year contract on Monday afternoon, according to an official team announcement.
So, I mentioned it to Zach first and Zach was incredible on that play.” Not convinced?
No one is denying the Eagles need to add more talent at receiver and adding Pascal would hardly be a sexy signing.
But with wide receivers hardly lining up to play with Jalen Hurts, the Birds had to resort to a fallback option.
The Eagles signing Pascal does not preclude them from adding more receiver talent, be it via trade or the 2022 NFL Draft.

     Summary: I can't wait to build those same relationships with the players here in Philadelphia."
Now, Sirianni is continuing his relationship with Pascal, with whom the Eagles agreed to terms on a one-year deal they announced on Monday afternoon.
Said Sirianni of Pascal in mid-September when asked about the roots of the "Dawg Mentality": "Zach Pascal, our receiver in Indianapolis, he had the shirts and passed them out.
They went out, and the gates opened for them to hunt, and they went out and hunt.
When Zach Pascal had that shirt, and we were all like, 'Man, that shirt's cool,' that kind of tied it in together there."
