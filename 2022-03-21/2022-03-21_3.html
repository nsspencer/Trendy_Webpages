A Boeing (ticker: BA) 738-800 jet operated by China Eastern Airlines crashed Monday in the mountains on a domestic flight.
The model was the prior version of the 737 dubbed Next Generation, or NG.
The MAX jets were grounded worldwide from March 2019 through...

     Boeing Faces New Upheaval After Crash of Chinese Airliner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boeing also said that its technical experts were “prepared to assist” China’s aviation authority, the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
Boeing delivered nearly 5,000 of the planes between 1998 and 2020, far more than any of the other commercial planes it sells, according to Boeing data.
China is home to nearly 1,200, followed by Europe, with nearly 1,000, and the United States, with nearly 800.
In the United States, American Airlines has 265 in service, while Southwest Airlines has 205, United Airlines has 136 and Delta Air Lines has 77, according to Cirium.
China is also the second-largest market for Boeing planes, after the United States.

     Summary: A China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board plunged midflight and crashed in a mountainous area of southern China on Monday, according to officials and flight-tracking data.
Debris was found but not passengers, state media reported early Tuesday, local time.
Chinese state media said the crash had caused a fire in the mountains.
The 737-800 that crashed Monday in China first flew in June 2015.
It was not a Boeing 737 Max, the plane that was grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.

     Summary: A Boeing 737-800 crashed in China with 132 people on board.
While Boeing has come under fire previously for crashes, it was the company's Boeing 737 Max that generated some of the harshest criticism over safety concerns.
In 2010, an Ethiopian Airlines flight, operated by a Boeing 737-800, crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in 98 deaths.
What's the difference between a Boeing 737-800 and a Boeing 737 Max?
