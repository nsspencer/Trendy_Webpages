     Babylon Bee names Dr. Rachel Levine ‘Man of the Year,’ gets Twitter suspension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Babylon Bee recently called former Pennsylvania Secretary of Health, Dr. Rachel Levine, their “Man of the Year.”As a response, Twitter has suspended the website’s account.
The Babylon Bee—a satirical site akin to the Onion but with a conservative perspective—posted an article titled “The Babylon Bee’s Man Of The Year Is Rachel Levine” to its website along with a corresponding tweet last Tuesday.
The article reads as if Levine—who is a trans woman—is the actual recipient of the Bee’s “first annual Man of the Year” title.
“We’re not deleting anything” says Babylon Bee CEO, Seth Dillon.
If the cost of telling the truth is the loss of our Twitter account, so be it.”One may still view the Babylon Bee’s Twitter page as of the publishing of this article, although it appears its employees cannot access the account.

The post that offended Twitter is still online at Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: FB) Facebook.

Ahead of the locking of The Babylon Bee account, Dillon took aim on his personal Twitter page at another high-profile transgender individual, NCAA swimmer Lia Thomas.
"If Lia Thomas were actually a woman, then I don't think anyone would be talking about his performance-enhancing testicles," Dillon tweeted.

     Babylon Bee refuses to delete tweet mocking Rachel Levine despite being blocked from Twitter
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Conservative Christian satire website The Babylon Bee has been suspended by Twitter over a tweet naming transgender US Assistant Secretary of Health Dr Rachel Levine its 'Man of the Year.'
On March 15, The Babylon Bee's Twitter account fired off a tweet featuring a link to an article bearing the headline: 'The Babylon Bee’s Man Of The Year Is Rachel Levine.'
Congratulations, Rachel Levine!'
So far, The Babylon Bee has not been kicked off Facebook, where on Sunday it posted a status update addressing its Twitter suspension.
In June 2021, The New York Times was forced to retract its comments about The Babylon Bee after labeling it 'misinformation' rather than satire.
