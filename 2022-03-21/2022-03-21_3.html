The final day of this severe weather outbreak will be Wednesday.
The states in the greatest risk area include much of the Carolinas, Georgia and northern Florida.

     Summary: Tornado warnings were issued Monday night for portions of Dallas, Tarrant, Collin and Denton counties.

On Tuesday, areas of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama could see "a regional severe weather outbreak," the Storm Prediction Center said.
Anyone living in state or FEMA temporary housing needs to keep cellphones on and fully charged, with the volume high and severe weather alerts enabled, the agencies said.
