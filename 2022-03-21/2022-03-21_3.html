     The Boeing 737 Crash Isn’t Worrying the Market. How We Know.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A plane crash in China has clearly shaken investor confidence in Boeing.
But the rest of the aerospace supply chain is holding up better, which could mean the crash won’t drag down the industry like two deadly crashes of Boeing’s MAX model a few years ago.
A Boeing (ticker: BA) 738-800 jet operated by China Eastern Airlines crashed Monday in the mountains on a domestic flight.
The model was the prior version of the 737 dubbed Next Generation, or NG.
The MAX jets were grounded worldwide from March 2019 through...

     Boeing 737 passenger jet crashes in China with 132 people on board
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board plunged midflight and crashed in a mountainous area of southern China on Monday, according to officials and flight-tracking data.
Debris was found but not passengers, state media reported early Tuesday, local time.
Chinese state media said the crash had caused a fire in the mountains.
The 737-800 that crashed Monday in China first flew in June 2015.
It was not a Boeing 737 Max, the plane that was grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.

     Boeing Faces New Upheaval After Crash of Chinese Airliner
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boeing also said that its technical experts were “prepared to assist” China’s aviation authority, the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
Boeing delivered nearly 5,000 of the planes between 1998 and 2020, far more than any of the other commercial planes it sells, according to Boeing data.
China is home to nearly 1,200, followed by Europe, with nearly 1,000, and the United States, with nearly 800.
In the United States, American Airlines has 265 in service, while Southwest Airlines has 205, United Airlines has 136 and Delta Air Lines has 77, according to Cirium.
China is also the second-largest market for Boeing planes, after the United States.

     Boeing 737 crash will test investor confidence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The crash of a Boeing jet in China sent the company’s shares down 5.6% at one point Monday, signaling a test of investor confidence just as the plane maker was starting to put a number of crises in its past.
Driving the news: A Boeing 737-800 plane carrying 132 people for China Eastern Airlines crashed in the mountains of southern China's Guangxi region on Monday.
“Operator or maintenance issues” are typically far more likely in situations like this, which “suggests there won’t be any long-term impact to Boeing from the crash,” Scarola continued.
Yes, but: “Until we find out exactly what happened we won’t be surprised to see sentiment materially worsen for Boeing shares,” Scarola said.
All of China Eastern’s 737-800 planes were ordered grounded following the Monday crash, Chinese state media reported, according to the AP.

The China Eastern Airlines Corp. jet that crashed was delivered to the carrier in June 2015.

     Chinese Boeing 737 With 132 Onboard Crashes After A Sudden Descent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Boeing 737-800 passenger airliner has crashed in southern China after descending from cruising altitude at a rate of 31,000 feet per minute.
Early reports suggest no sign of survivors among the 123 passengers and nine crew onboard as Chinese emergency services begin a search and rescue operation.
A graph of the 737's descent shows that the steep descent was briefly arrested below 10,000 feet before the crash.
Reuters, citing a People’s Daily state news report, says that a local fire department has found no signs of survivors among the 132 onboard.
China Eastern and Boeing have changed the colors of their sites in China to black and white in mourning of the crash.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Boeing 737-800 crashed in China with 132 people on board.
While Boeing has come under fire previously for crashes, it was the company's Boeing 737 Max that generated some of the harshest criticism over safety concerns.
In 2010, an Ethiopian Airlines flight, operated by a Boeing 737-800, crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in 98 deaths.
What's the difference between a Boeing 737-800 and a Boeing 737 Max?
He added the Boeing 737 Max was the first time he had seen the company cause a massive public scare.
