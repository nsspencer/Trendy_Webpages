    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Naturally, as all Urban anecdotes do, it has taken Twitter by storm.
The excerpt comes from an excellent longform piece published by The Athletic on Monday, titled "'The most toxic environment I've ever been a part of': Inside Urban Meyer's disastrous year with the Jaguars."
Written and reported on by Mike Sando and Jayson Jenks, the piece includes all kinds of Urban goodies, none more jarring then the one making the social media rounds about Meyer... not knowing who Aaron Donald is?

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A report by The Athletic’s Jayson Senks and Mike Sando detailed Urban Meyer’s tumultuous and short-lived tenure as the Jaguars coach where multiple people described the environment as “toxic.”“The most toxic environment I’ve ever been a part of,” a veteran member of the football operations staff told The Athletic.
Not even close.”In the report, there are several accounts of Meyer belittling staff and players while also threatening to fire them on a regular basis.
“Who’s this 99 guy on the Rams?” Meyer asked one staffer during the season, according to The Athletic.
The Jaguars finished the season 3–14 and hired former Eagles coach Doug Pederson to replace Meyer.

     Former Jaguars HC Urban Meyer’s tenure worse than originally thought
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saying that Urban Meyer’s tenure as the head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars was bad is an understatement but after a recent article by The Athletic, it might have been worse than it originally seemed and that’s saying something.
What was Jaguars owner Shad Khan thinking when he hired Urban Meyer?
When you are in a toxic relationship, red flags are just flags, and Jaguars owner Shad Khan was so fixated with Urban Meyer that he failed to see all his flaws.
Had there been a check-in-balance kind of system in place, things might have not been as bad but the former Jaguars head coach routinely abuse his power.
Meyer set the Jaguars back and it will be up to Doug Pederson, general manager Trent Baalke, and owner Shad Khan to clean the mess.

     Urban Meyer didn’t know who Aaron Donald was as Jaguars saga keeps getting worse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meyer is said to have been “unfamiliar with star players around the league,” as multiple sources told The Athletic – including future Hall of Fame defensive tackle Aaron Donald.
When it came to his own players and staffers, however, Meyer didn’t exactly instill confidence about their futures.
“Hey, Trevor, you’ve got to slow it down for him,” Meyer reportedly said to the two players.
The Jaguars have since hired former Eagles coach Doug Pederson as Meyer’s replacement.
Pederson has already received the stamp of approval from Lawrence, whom the Jaguars selected with the top pick in last year’s NFL Draft.

     Summary: (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong , File)JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – By now, most Jacksonville Jaguars fans know the Urban Meyer era was a complete disaster filled with embarrassing headlines and even more losses.
Reporters Jayson Jenks and Mike Sando spoke to multiple sources, including former Jaguars wide receiver D.J.
Chark, who said Meyer was belittling, demeaning, led by fear and created an extremely toxic work environment in the process.
Not even close.”Chark, who spent four seasons with the Jaguars before signing with the Lions last week, told The Athletic Meyer threatened to fire coaches in front of other players.
Former Jaguars player Josh Lambo said in a story to the Tampa Bay Times that Meyer kicked him during warmups and called special teams players derogatory names.

     Urban Meyer's season with Jaguars was reportedly more 'toxic' than anyone knew
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Meyer reportedly used that as an opportunity to insult Brown's intelligence based on where he's from.
According to The Athletic, Meyer also berated, belittled, and threatened coaches in front of players and behind closed doors.
In November, receiver Marvin Jones was enraged to the point of leaving the Jags facility when Meyer told reporters that the receivers had been running the wrong route.
I don’t micromanage that.”In a staff meeting the next morning, according to multiple sources, Meyer denied ever telling his coaches to bench Robinson.
Players were reportedly relieved when Meyer was fired on Dec. 15, and it's easy to see why.
