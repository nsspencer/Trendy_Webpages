     Reports: Marc-Andre Fleury traded to Minnesota Wild
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A big potential goaltending target is off the trade board for the Washington Capitals as goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury has been traded to the Minnesota Wild, per multiple reports.
The 37-year-old would've certainly represented an upgrade at the position for Washington, but he'll head to Minnesota instead.
In recent weeks Vitek Vanecek has played well in goal, but general manager Brian MacLellan added a few weeks ago that a more veteran goalie could offer stability.
With a $7 million cap hit, the return was unclear, but the Wild had added a Vezina-caliber goalie that has a Stanley Cup pedigree.
Penguins fans can also breathe a bit easier, as a longtime franchise favorite won’t head to a rival team.
