     Summary: The Arizona Cardinals have done very little this off-season, but one thing they were able to do was add a young cornerback.
That’s why when Danny Kelly of “The Ringer” came out with his newest 2022 NFL Mock Draft, I was surprised with his pick.
Arizona Cardinals - Andrew Booth Jr., CB - Clemson“The Cardinals need to upgrade their talent and depth at cornerback.
He has the size and physicality to compete with receivers like DK Metcalf, Cooper Kupp, and Deebo Samuel.”Booth is a good cornerback, but I worry about his health.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The TCU Horned Frogs had reason to gripe Sunday after an 85-80 overtime loss to the Arizona Wildcats in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
With the game tied up with the last possession of regulation, Arizona predicted TCU guard Mike Miles would be creating the final shot.
A bump from Miles’ defender, Dalen Terry, sent the Horned Frogs’ leading scorer flying across the halfcourt line — whether the contact was embellished or not.
TCU fans likely thought Miles fell because of a foul.

     Summary: North Carolina is thinking the same thing.
The Wildcats and Tar Heels meet in the second round of the Greensboro Region on Monday night, both hoping to erase some of the mistakes that left them vulnerable to upsets by higher-seeded opponents in their openers.
North Carolina has a short turnaround against another pressing team in what will be a tough road environment.
This is not one of those games,” North Carolina coach Courtney Banghart said.
“With a player like that, it is not always on one person,” North Carolina junior guard Eva Hodgson said.

     Summary: SAN DIEGO — Arizona got lucky this time.
TCU’s 6-foot-11 freshman center Eddie Lampkin Jr. grabbed 10 offensive rebounds against Arizona and rang up 20 points on 8-for-9 shooting.
"I thought we were just OK," Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said of his team’s physical play.
Arizona committed 19 turnovers in its first round win against Wright State on Friday, then 16 Sunday against TCU.
It won’t help Arizona that Houston will be playing in its home state, where its fans could outnumber and outshout those from Arizona.

     Summary: By JOE REEDY AP Sports WriterSAN DIEGO (AP) – Bennedict Mathurin has come through plenty in clutch situations for Arizona.
After getting the rebound and making the basket, Mathurin did a couple fist pumps near the baseline.
Chuck O’Bannon Jr. had a career-high 23 points for TCU (21-13) while Mike Miles Jr. and Eddie Lampkin Jr. had 20 apiece.
TCU still had a chance to win in regulation after Mathurin’s big shot, but Miles lost the ball near midcourt.
The Horned Frogs held Arizona scoreless for 5:09 before Terry’s 3 from the right corner tied it at 70.
