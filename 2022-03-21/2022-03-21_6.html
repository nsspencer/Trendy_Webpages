     Thank you, Brad Davison
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following a disappointing 2020 campaign, senior guard Brad Davison decided to utilize his extra year of eligibility granted by the NCAA due to the COVID-19 shortened season.
The team he would be returning to was going to be vastly different from the senior laden roster he played with the previous season.
Nobody was happier to see Davison return than head coach Greg Gard, knowing full well there was nobody that led by example quite like the fifth year senior did.
The impact and influence Davison had on this program will be remembered well after he’s gone.
Thank you, Brad Davison, for five years of unforgettable memories.

     Wisconsin Basketball: A thank you to Brad Davison
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Patrick McDermott/Getty Images)It’s a day that seemed like it would never arrive, but Brad Davison has played his final game for Wisconsin Basketball.
A thank you to Brad Davison from Wisconsin Basketball fansBrad Davison is a player that fans and coaches alike dream about.
It’s unfortunate that the other fan bases have such a negative perception of Davison because even more important than Brad Davison the player, is Brad Davison the man.
Few people brought more to the Wisconsin Men’s Basketball team than Brad Davison and that is what made him so special to us.
So, if you’re Brad Davison and you’re reading this, thank you for all that you gave us during the last five years.
