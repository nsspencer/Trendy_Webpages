     'Winning Time' Episode 3: Why did UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian not coach the Lakers?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's a known fact that UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian was one of the candidates that Dr Jerry Buss looked at to coach the Los Angeles Lakers after Jerry West handed his resignation.
'Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty' Episode 3 sheds light on the aftermath of West's resignation and ends with Tarkanian tipping to take the role.
Tarkanian and his close friend, Vic Weiss (who negotiated on his behalf) with Buss were one of the storylines of the episode.
According to Pearlman, Weiss has a certain "slipperiness'.

     Did a Mob Hit Really Prevent Jerry Tarkanian From Coaching the Lakers?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (The show doesn’t exactly delve into why the mafia would be so opposed to Tarkanian coaching the team, but it makes several vague references to Weiss’s gambling debt.
But Winning Time has been known to take some creative liberties, so it’s worth asking: is this really how it all went down?
I didn’t know, as a huge Lakers fan, that Jerry Tarkanian had been hired!
Tarkanian had, in fact, been hired by the Lakers shortly before Weiss’s murder.
The murder was never solved, but it seems more likely that Weiss was killed over the $60,000 in gambling debts he owed than over his involvement in a potential Lakers deal.

     Winning Time: The True Story Behind the Murder of Vic Weiss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s why the wildest anecdote yet to be showcased in HBO’s “Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty” – the murder of Vic Weiss – is likely to raise some questions.
So, what happened to Vic Weiss?
However, his business manager and lifelong friend Vic Weiss (Danny Burstein) wants him to lead the Lakers.
The saga of Vic Weiss’ murder is juicy enough to merit a series of its own.
He was present at the meeting with Tarkanian, Buss and Weiss, making him one of the last people who saw Weiss alive.

     Winning Time: How close was Jerry Tarkanian to signing with the Lakers?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The main storyline of episode three of “Winning Time” is new Lakers owner Jerry Buss’ pursuit of a new head coach, a search that quickly zooms in on UNLV head coach Jerry Tarkanian.
Tarkanian had led Long Beach State to four consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances and back-to-back Elite Eights in the early ‘70s before leaving for Las Vegas.
“I loved Las Vegas, my family loved Las Vegas,” Tarkanian said.
You are Las Vegas.
“He just didn’t get past it.” When Tarkanian called Buss to tell him he had decided to remain in Las Vegas, the new Lakers owner held no grudge.

     ‘Winning Time’ Recap: Three Coaches Walk Into a Bar, and a Fish Saves Pittsburgh
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (*) In real life, Riley and Hearn started working together several years before the events of this season, but dramatizations often expand and contract timelines like this.
But the good life is an unfulfilling one for a pathological competitor, leaving him an exposed nerve constantly getting into trouble.
As “The Good Life” lays out, Tark the Shark was constantly under investigation by the NCAA for various infractions.
But Jerry Buss’ charm seems incapable of penetrating Tarkanian’s no-frills persona.
* Finally, Jerry Buss taking us through the elaborate ritual he uses to create his combover is funny while also evoking the similar scene in American Hustle.
