     Summary: The TCU Horned Frogs had reason to gripe Sunday after an 85-80 overtime loss to the Arizona Wildcats in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
With the game tied up with the last possession of regulation, Arizona predicted TCU guard Mike Miles would be creating the final shot.
A bump from Miles’ defender, Dalen Terry, sent the Horned Frogs’ leading scorer flying across the halfcourt line — whether the contact was embellished or not.
TCU fans likely thought Miles fell because of a foul.
THIS ENDING IS INSANE pic.twitter.com/eAm0Lc95Xv — CBS Sports (@CBSSports) March 21, 2022“I think everyone’s seen it, is talking about it,” Horned Frogs head coach Jamie Dixon told reporters Sunday after the loss.

     Summary: Arizona is still paying the price for all of this with the NCAA not expected to rule on Arizona until the summer.
If you are a senior now, you’ve experienced the worst media coverage and fallout of Arizona basketball in its history, which makes the 2022 NCAA Tournament all the more rewarding.
This year's team has been amazing to watch and is a culmination of sorts for that senior class especially to prove that Arizona is back as a basketball power.
Arizona men’s basketball is finally back on the national stage and is joined by the women’s basketball team’s ascension, as well, to establish Arizona as a premier basketball school.
