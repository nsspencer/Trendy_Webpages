     All Signs Point To Quiet NHL Trade Deadline For New Jersey Devils
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Jersey Devils have been tied to rumors from everyone to obvious trade candidates in P.K.
To be honest, it just seems like the Devils are going to stand pat at the deadline.
By the time you’re reading this, it’s probably getting intesely close to the trade deadline.
The Devils were already sitting back and letting people contact them at this deadline, but that strategy might not have been the best.
Now, it looks like the Devils will keep Subban until the season ends or they terminate his contract.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's trade season in the NHL, and with the flurry of activity at the NHL Trade Deadline, ESPN has the instant fantasy hockey reaction to guide what to expect from these old faces in their new places.
Philadelphia Flyers acquire Owen Tippett: Tippett is the Flyers return for the rental of their longtime captain.
We can revisit Tippett for fantasy before next season when we see what the Flyers do in the offseason.
Giordano has averaged better than 2.0 fantasy points per game in each of the past six seasons before seeing his output fade to 1.8 with the expansion Kraken.
A defensive stalwart who can manage the power play when he has to, Lindholm should push McAvoy's fantasy value up to the next level.

     Summary: Welcome to Pro Hockey Talk’s 2022 NHL Trade Deadline live blog.
The defenseman has a $1.25 million cap hit and has been on long-term injured reserve since March 9.
While there’s plenty of interest in the 23-year-old blue liner, unless a GM knocks Bill Armstrong’s socks off, this might end up being a summer trade.
The 31-year-old Hamonic is signed through next season with a $3 million cap hit.
Little still has two years left on his contract that carries a $5.291 million cap hit.
