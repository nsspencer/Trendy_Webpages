The Kraken have five picks in the first two rounds with four coming in the second in this year’s draft.
“The foundation of any successful organization is the draft picks and the prospects they have coming,” Francis said.

     Marc-Andre Fleury Among the Winners at NHL Trade Deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By LARRY LAGE, AP Hockey WriterMarc-Andre Fleury may have been the biggest winner at the NHL trade deadline, getting dealt by the rebuilding Chicago Blackhawks to the potentially contending Minnesota Wild.
The Wild gave up a conditional first-round pick in this year’s draft, and Chicago agreed to pay half of what is left on the last year of Fleury’s three-year contract.
The Rangers gave up a total of five picks, including two conditional second-round selections to Winnipeg, along with a pair of minor league prospects.
COLORADO AVALANCEThe NHL-leading Avs, clearly, are not content with their place in the standings by acquiring forward Artturi Lehkonen from Montreal to make plays at both ends of the ice.
His 154 goals in 550 games rank fifth on the Ducks' all-time list and his secondary scoring is needed in Pittsburgh.

     NHL Trade Deadline: What the Fleury, Carpenter Deals Mean for the Blackhawks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In all, the Blackhawks acquired four draft picks in three separate trades, including two first-round picks and a second-round pick that could become a first-round pick.
The Blackhawks got deadline day off to a rollicking start by finally agreeing on a trade that sent Marc-Andre Fleury to the Minnesota Wild.
In exchange, the Blackhawks received a conditional second round pick, which could be upgraded to a first-round pick depending on the Wild’s success level in the postseason.
The draft pick the Blackhawks received is for the 2022 NHL Draft, and could become a first-round pick if Fleury wins at least four games and if the Wild advance to at least the Western Conference Final.
In his third season with the Blackhawks, Carpenter has three goals and eight assists in 59 games, and has also tallied 36 penalty minutes.
