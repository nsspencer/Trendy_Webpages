     All Signs Point To Quiet NHL Trade Deadline For New Jersey Devils
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Jersey Devils have been tied to rumors from everyone to obvious trade candidates in P.K.
To be honest, it just seems like the Devils are going to stand pat at the deadline.
By the time you’re reading this, it’s probably getting intesely close to the trade deadline.
The Devils were already sitting back and letting people contact them at this deadline, but that strategy might not have been the best.
Now, it looks like the Devils will keep Subban until the season ends or they terminate his contract.

     NHL trade deadline: Fantasy hockey instant reaction
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's trade season in the NHL, and with the flurry of activity at the NHL Trade Deadline, ESPN has the instant fantasy hockey reaction to guide what to expect from these old faces in their new places.
We can revisit Tippett for fantasy before next season when we see what the Flyers do in the offseason.
Giordano has averaged better than 2.0 fantasy points per game in each of the past six seasons before seeing his output fade to 1.8 with the expansion Kraken.
A defensive stalwart who can manage the power play when he has to, Lindholm should push McAvoy's fantasy value up to the next level.
Lindholm has never been a solid fantasy play on his own, topping out at 1.7 fantasy points per game in 2017-18, but he'll make McAvoy better and he'll make life even easier than it already is for Jeremy Swayman.

     NHL trade deadline tracker: All-Star Claude Giroux says Panthers were at ‘top of my list’

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia Flyers’ Claude Giroux (28) prepares for a face-off Carolina Hurricanes during the third period of an NHL hockey game in Raleigh, N.C., Saturday, March 12, 2022.
1:55 p.m.: Claude Giroux just spoke for close to 15 minutes about his trade to the Panthers and made it clear Florida was his top choice.
12:15 p.m.: Claude Giroux is set to arrive at FLA Live Arena in the next hour or so after the Panthers traded for the All-Star forward Saturday.
With nearly $5.5 million in cap space, Florida is a place where teams can offload contracts to make cap math work.
In the last year, Florida traded away its first-round picks in the 2022, 2023 and 2024 NHL Entry Drafts.
