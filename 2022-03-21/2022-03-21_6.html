     Summary: In the way of Jennie Baranczyk and her 4-seeded Sooners (25-8) stands the 5-seed, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish (23-8).
Back in 2008, Notre Dame dumped the Sooners out of the tournament in the second round with a 79-74 overtime victory.
5 Notre Dame, Monday, 5 p.m., ESPN2Notre Dame won the rubber match in 2011, dominating OU 78-56 in the Sweet 16.
Both coaches are the architects of huge turnarounds, with Baranczyk’s coming in her first year in charge in Norman, and Ivey finding success in Year 2 at Notre Dame.
Standing 5-11, Miles’ size also creates a mismatch Notre Dame will hope to exploit.

They'll go for an even bigger win tonight against five-seed Notre Dame (23-8)If the Sooners (25-8) win, they'll advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2013.
Dynamic duo needs to lead the wayThe team couldn't have asked for much more from seniors Taylor Robertson and Madi Williams Saturday.
Other Sooners need to step upOutside of Robertson and Williams, the other Sooners mostly struggled against IUPUI.
Big games from Robertson and Williams would help the Sooners a lot, but they'll need their teammates to step up to beat a good Notre Dame team.
