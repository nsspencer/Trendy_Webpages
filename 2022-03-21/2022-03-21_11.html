     Babylon Bee names Dr. Rachel Levine ‘Man of the Year,’ gets Twitter suspension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Babylon Bee recently called former Pennsylvania Secretary of Health, Dr. Rachel Levine, their “Man of the Year.”As a response, Twitter has suspended the website’s account.
The Babylon Bee—a satirical site akin to the Onion but with a conservative perspective—posted an article titled “The Babylon Bee’s Man Of The Year Is Rachel Levine” to its website along with a corresponding tweet last Tuesday.
The article reads as if Levine—who is a trans woman—is the actual recipient of the Bee’s “first annual Man of the Year” title.
“We’re not deleting anything” says Babylon Bee CEO, Seth Dillon.
If the cost of telling the truth is the loss of our Twitter account, so be it.”One may still view the Babylon Bee’s Twitter page as of the publishing of this article, although it appears its employees cannot access the account.

     Twitter suspends Babylon Bee for misgendering Rachel Levine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: To regain access to the account, The Babylon Bee has to delete the tweet that violates Twitter’s guidelines, a Twitter spokesperson said.
The tweet that triggered the temporary lock misgendered Levine by stating, “The Babylon Bee’s Man Of The Year is Rachel Levine,” according to a screenshot tweeted by Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon on his personal account.
The Babylon Bee tweet was posted after USA Today named Levine, who is transgender, as one of its Women of the Year.
Levine, 64, was honored for her work in the Biden administration leading 6,000 uniformed public health officers during a pandemic.
Twitter on Thursday flagged another tweet misgendering Levine from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) but left the tweet accessible to view under the warning label.

     Summary: Twitter says it will restore the account, which has more than 1.3 million followers, if the Bee deletes the tweet, but CEO Seth Dillon says he has no intention of doing so.
Men in India wear dress-type garments, don’t they?”Twitter has suspended the account of right-leaning satirical news site The Babylon Bee after it named Rachel Levine, a Biden administration official, as its “man of the year.” APTwitter suspended the account after it said the Bee violated its “hateful conduct” policy.
Twitter/@SethDillonDillon tweeted news of the suspension from his own account, attaching a screenshot of the notice from Twitter.
Twitter/@SethDillon“The account you referenced as been temporarily blocked for violating our hateful conduct policy,” a Twitter spokesperson said.
“The account owner is required to delete the violative Tweet before regaining access to their account.”

     Twitter Suspends Right-Wing Site for Misgendering Rachel Levine
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Babylon Bee, a satirical right-wing site, has been suspended from Twitter due to its tweet misgendering Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The site was suspended for violating Twitter’s hateful conduct rule with its tweet saying it had selected Levine, a transgender woman, as its Man of the Year.
Last Thursday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, well known for his anti-trans stances, tweeted “Rachel Levine is a man” in reaction to the USA Today article.
Social media companies have a responsibility to remove harmful anti-trans content that violates their own policies.
Last year, Twitter suspended the account of Jim Banks, a Republican congressman from Indiana, after he misgendered Levine in a tweet about her becoming a four-star admiral.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Conservative Christian satire website The Babylon Bee has been suspended by Twitter over a tweet naming transgender US Assistant Secretary of Health Dr Rachel Levine its 'Man of the Year.'
On March 15, The Babylon Bee's Twitter account fired off a tweet featuring a link to an article bearing the headline: 'The Babylon Bee’s Man Of The Year Is Rachel Levine.'
Congratulations, Rachel Levine!'
So far, The Babylon Bee has not been kicked off Facebook, where on Sunday it posted a status update addressing its Twitter suspension.
In June 2021, The New York Times was forced to retract its comments about The Babylon Bee after labeling it 'misinformation' rather than satire.
