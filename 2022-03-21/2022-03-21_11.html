     Wild acquire Marc-Andre Fleury; Johansson back to Caps - Austin Daily Herald
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Minnesota gave up a conditional first-round pick in this year’s draft to acquire the 37-year-old Fleury hours before the NHL trade deadline on Monday.
The Wild opened the day sitting fourth overall — and third in the Central Division — in a tightly contested playoff race.
In acquiring Fleury, who won a Vezina Trophy a year ago with Vegas, Minnesota traded backup goalie Kaapo Kahkonen and a fifth-round draft pick to San Jose for defenseman Jake Middleton.
The Washington Capitals acquired Johansson from the expansion Seattle Kraken, in exchange for forward Daniel Sprong and two later-round draft picks.
— The Coyotes acquired unsigned forward prospect Nathan Smith and Bryan Little’s contract from the Winnipeg Jets for a 2022 fourth-round pick.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Blackhawks traded goaltender Marc-André Fleury to the Minnesota Wild for a conditional second-round pick that can become a first, it was announced on Monday.
The draft pick could turn into a first if the Wild reach the Western Conference finals and Fleury wins at least four games in those rounds.
Wild goaltender Kaapo Kahkonen has also been traded to the San Jose Sharks along with a fifth-round pick in exchange for defenseman Jacob Middleton.
But if not for Fleury, the Blackhawks would be even worse off than they are.
The Bruins dominated every facet of the game, but Fleury made 46 saves — several of them spectacular — to get the game to overtime and steal a point.
