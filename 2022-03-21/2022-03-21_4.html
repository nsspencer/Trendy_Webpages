     Summary: The gist of Coors Hangover Effect is that pitches at other ballparks have more movement than pitches at Coors due to the elevation decreasing pitch movement.
This is a major reason for the drastic home-road splits Rockies hitters experience.
He posted an .807 OPS compared to the .924 OPS he compiled between 2014 and 2019.
Since 2019, Fenway ranks second to Coors Field in overall Park Factor, albeit with less aggressive splits between home and road.
While the Rockies had a .174 OPS difference between home and road in 2021, the Red Sox had a .104 OPS difference in and out of Fenway.

On another note, I’d like to leave you with this:Davey replaced Dusty in this job.
These games could be fraught matchup for Dusty and even for the Nats.

     Summary: Red Sox Will Trevor Story’s splits away from Coors Field hurt production with Red Sox?
New Red Sox shortstop Trevor Story has struggled away from Coors Fields in his career.
(AP Photo/Darryl Webb)Recent Links 4 things to know about new Red Sox star Trevor StoryEven with the excitement around the Red Sox’ signing of former Colorado Rockies star shortstop Trevor Story, the questions remain unavoidable.
Should the Red Sox be forking over $140 million over six years to a guy who apparently can’t hit nearly as well outside of Coors Field?
Fenway Park might not be Coors Field in terms of being hitter-friendly, but it’s the next-best thing.

The signing wasn’t a total surprise — reports had the Red Sox in the mix, along with the Astros, Yankees, and Rangers — but the very reasonable terms of the contract were.

Bloom also bludgeoned the narrative that the Red Sox would no longer spend big money on star players, which is a relief.

     Boston Red Sox: Pros and cons of the Trevor Story signing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Red Sox emerged from the shadows and finally got “real” in free agency with the signing of the former Colorado Rockies shortstop, Trevor Story.
The question that every Red Sox fan may be asking is, just how good is the signing?
Boston Red Sox pros in signing Trevor StoryStory has a pretty good reputation it seems around baseball.
Boston Red Sox cons of signing StoryThe first is fairly obvious; the Red Sox have a pretty good shortstop already on the team in Xander Bogaerts, at least for this season after which when he can opt-out of his current deal.
Presumably, the Red Sox did due diligence to be certain that he can throw the ball to first base from either position.

     Scattered thoughts on the Red Sox signing Trevor Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is an opt-out after the fourth season, which the Red Sox can negate if they so choose by adding a seventh year worth $20 million.
This is far and away the biggest move the Red Sox have made this winter, and the biggest they’ve made in a few years, so it’s time to dust off the scattered thoughts format.
I’ve also seen some speculation that the Red Sox could trade Bogaerts before the season.
At the deadline if it seems like he’s going to walk and the Red Sox are out of contention?
I’ve seen some talk about how this affects some of the top prospects in the Red Sox system like Marcelo Mayer and Nick Yorke.
