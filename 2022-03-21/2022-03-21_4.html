    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's trade season in the NHL, and with the flurry of activity at the NHL Trade Deadline, ESPN has the instant fantasy hockey reaction to guide what to expect from these old faces in their new places.
Philadelphia Flyers acquire Owen Tippett: Tippett is the Flyers return for the rental of their longtime captain.
We can revisit Tippett for fantasy before next season when we see what the Flyers do in the offseason.
Giordano has averaged better than 2.0 fantasy points per game in each of the past six seasons before seeing his output fade to 1.8 with the expansion Kraken.
A defensive stalwart who can manage the power play when he has to, Lindholm should push McAvoy's fantasy value up to the next level.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Welcome to Pro Hockey Talk’s 2022 NHL Trade Deadline live blog.
While there’s plenty of interest in the 23-year-old blue liner, unless a GM knocks Bill Armstrong’s socks off, this might end up being a summer trade.
After requesting a trade earlier this season, Jake DeBrusk and the Bruins have worked out a two-year, $8 million extension.
“This trade immediately puts us in a better position at the 2022 NHL Entry Draft, giving us a pick that will land early in the draft,” said Davidson following the Fleury trade.
ET – Interesting note via the NHL: There have been 1,177 players dealt on deadline day since 1980.
