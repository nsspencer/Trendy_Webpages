     Matt Ryan trade: 4 Teams that should be in the mix for the former MVP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Today is decision day for the Atlanta Falcons and Matt Ryan, will the quarterback stay in Atlanta or get a much-deserved trade?
Let’s be clear here Ryan deserves a trade only if the veteran wants one after his team decided to chase Deshaun Watson despite having the former MVP under contract.
The Falcons only have until four today to trade Ryan considering the quarterback is due a roster bonus.
Ryan is going to have to agree to any potential trade to waive his no-trade clause.
The #Falcons fielded trade calls the last few days centered around QB Matt Ryan, sources say.

     Falcons fielding trade calls for longtime QB Matt Ryan; Colts discussing possible deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday morning that the Falcons have fielded trade calls the past few days centered around the former MVP quarterback, per sources informed of the situation.
Today marks the deadline for a decision on Ryan, who will earn a $7.5 million roster bonus if he's still part of the team at 4 p.m.
Rapoport reported during NFL NOW that the Indianapolis Colts would be the most likely landing spot for Ryan, and the two teams have been in talks for a potential deal.
So Atlanta's choices are to trade Ryan and take on a big dead-money cap hit, or he'll be back with the only club he's known in 14 years in the NFL.
Rapoport added that the Falcons could add a sweetener to Ryan's contract after he accommodated their dalliance with Watson.
