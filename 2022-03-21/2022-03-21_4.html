     Yankees’ Aaron Judge doesn’t sound happy about Red Sox signing Trevor Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Yankees right fielder doesn’t sound happy about the Boston Red Sox signing former Colorado Rockies shortstop Trevor Story on Sunday.
Per MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand:Aaron Judge on Boston’s signing of Trevor Story: “I’m not too excited about it.
The 29-year-old Story, a two-time All-Star and two-time Silver Slugger Award winner, got a six-year, $140 million contract from the Red Sox, and will shift to second base since Boston already has an All-Star shortstop of its own in Xander Bogaerts.
Story’s signing closes the door on one of the best crop of free-agent shortstops in recent memory.
After the lockout, the Red Sox signed Story and the Minnesota Twins gave Carlos Correa a three-year, $105.3 million deal.

     Summary: The Giants were rumored to be one of the final teams in the mix for Story, who had a down year in 2021, which made him an obvious target for the fixer-upper Giants organization.
On another note, I’d like to leave you with this:Davey replaced Dusty in this job.
These games could be fraught matchup for Dusty and even for the Nats.

New Red Sox shortstop Trevor Story has struggled away from Coors Fields in his career.
(AP Photo/Darryl Webb)Recent Links 4 things to know about new Red Sox star Trevor StoryEven with the excitement around the Red Sox’ signing of former Colorado Rockies star shortstop Trevor Story, the questions remain unavoidable.
Should the Red Sox be forking over $140 million over six years to a guy who apparently can’t hit nearly as well outside of Coors Field?
Fenway Park might not be Coors Field in terms of being hitter-friendly, but it’s the next-best thing.

Bloom also bludgeoned the narrative that the Red Sox would no longer spend big money on star players, which is a relief.

     How Red Sox Most Affected By Trevor Story Deal Feel About Adding Star
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Red Sox chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom wanted to add another right-handed bat, and Story checks that box while providing an intriguing combination of power and speed.
All told, landing Story is a huge move for the Red Sox.
But three Red Sox players, in particular, inherently are impacted by Story’s arrival more than anyone else: Bogaerts, Kiké Hernández and Christian Arroyo.
Arroyo, meanwhile, was the frontrunner to assume Boston’s regular second-base duties this season until Story reportedly joined the Red Sox on a $140 million deal.
His possible playing time might’ve taken a hit Sunday, although Red Sox manager Alex Cora still will find ways to deploy the hard-nosed infielder.

     Scattered thoughts on the Red Sox signing Trevor Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is an opt-out after the fourth season, which the Red Sox can negate if they so choose by adding a seventh year worth $20 million.
This is far and away the biggest move the Red Sox have made this winter, and the biggest they’ve made in a few years, so it’s time to dust off the scattered thoughts format.
I’ve also seen some speculation that the Red Sox could trade Bogaerts before the season.
At the deadline if it seems like he’s going to walk and the Red Sox are out of contention?
I’ve seen some talk about how this affects some of the top prospects in the Red Sox system like Marcelo Mayer and Nick Yorke.
