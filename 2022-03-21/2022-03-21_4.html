     La’el Collins signs three-year deal with the Cincinnati Bengals after his release from the Dallas Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals have agreed to a three-year deal with offensive tackle La’el Collins, after his release from the Dallas Cowboys last week.
Collins spent his entire career thus far in Dallas, where he played right tackle and left guard over his six seasons with the Cowboys.
He has started in all but three games of the 74 he has played between 2015 to 2021.
The Cowboys released him on Thursday to save $10 million against the salary cap.

     Bengals locked down La'el Collins despite pushes by Patriots, Panthers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals got free agent La’el Collins in town and simply didn’t let go, doing whatever it took to get the star offensive tackle on the line in front of Joe Burrow.
Specifically, the New England Patriots made a “competitive offer” for Collins and the Carolina Panthers were in the race too, according to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler.
But as Collins told the media after signing his deal, no place had offensive line coach Frank Pollack, who he worked with for years in Dallas.
And no place has Joe Burrow — who played a key role in the recruiting effort over the weekend.
It has to be refreshing for Bengals fans to see the saga of a slipping-away free agent actually choose the team anyway.

     La'el Collins expected to sign with Bengals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals are finalizing a contract with free agent right tackle La’el Collins, according to NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo.
The Denver Broncos were thought to be a potential team to be in the mix for Collins, but it’s unclear if they tried to sign the veteran tackle.
Calvin Anderson and Tom Compton are Denver’s top right tackle options at the moment, and the Broncos will likely address the position in the NFL draft next month.
Collins was not a suspect in the investigation of the shooting, but police wanted to interview people who had known Mills.
Collins started nine more games after the suspension, ending the season with eight penalties and one sack allowed in 12 games (10 starts).

Obviously my history with (offensive line) coach Frank (Pollack).
He's the best offensive line coach I've been around since I've been in the NFL, hands down.
Offensive line coach Frank Pollack's presence helped the Bengals' cause.
While penalties have been an issue at times for Collins, he's allowed just four total sacks over the past two years combined.

     Summary: After what feels like an eternity, La’el Collins is a member of the Cincinnati Bengals.
He should be the best right tackle to play for the Bengals since Willie Anderson wore No.
He should provide upside and stability to the Bengals' offensive line and is immediately the best member unit.
This signing moves Cincinnati from just having a passable offensive line into having one of the better units in the league.
