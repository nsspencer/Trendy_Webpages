     La’el Collins signs three-year deal with the Cincinnati Bengals after his release from the Dallas Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals have agreed to a three-year deal with offensive tackle La’el Collins, after his release from the Dallas Cowboys last week.
Collins spent his entire career thus far in Dallas, where he played right tackle and left guard over his six seasons with the Cowboys.
He has started in all but three games of the 74 he has played between 2015 to 2021.
The Cowboys released him on Thursday to save $10 million against the salary cap.

     Bengals land La'el Collins: Cincinnati agrees to 3-year deal with former Cowboys offensive tackle, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals made it all the way to the Super Bowl in 2021 despite a lackluster offensive line, so the front office made the position group a priority this offseason.
Their most recent addition is former Dallas Cowboys right tackle La'el Collins, who agreed to sign with Cincinnati on Sunday.
Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, Collins receives a three-year, $30 million deal that looks like a two-year, $20 million deal worth up to $22 million.
The Bengals' offensive line allowed Joe Burrow to be sacked 19 times in the playoffs, which is the most a quarterback has been sacked in a single postseason.
With new starters at center, right guard and right tackle, Cincy is going to have a chance to run it back in 2022.

     La'el Collins expected to sign with Bengals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals are finalizing a contract with free agent right tackle La’el Collins, according to NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo.
The Denver Broncos were thought to be a potential team to be in the mix for Collins, but it’s unclear if they tried to sign the veteran tackle.
Calvin Anderson and Tom Compton are Denver’s top right tackle options at the moment, and the Broncos will likely address the position in the NFL draft next month.
Collins was not a suspect in the investigation of the shooting, but police wanted to interview people who had known Mills.
Collins started nine more games after the suspension, ending the season with eight penalties and one sack allowed in 12 games (10 starts).

He should be the best right tackle to play for the Bengals since Willie Anderson wore No.

     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals added the crown jewel to their offensive line remake, signing La'el Collins to a three-year contract on Sunday.
Obviously my history with (offensive line) coach Frank (Pollack).
He's the best offensive line coach I've been around since I've been in the NFL, hands down.
Offensive line coach Frank Pollack's presence helped the Bengals' cause.
While penalties have been an issue at times for Collins, he's allowed just four total sacks over the past two years combined.
