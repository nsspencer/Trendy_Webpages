     Blackhawks trade Marc-André Fleury to Wild: Sources
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Chicago Blackhawks are trading goaltender Marc-André Fleury to the Minnesota Wild for a conditional second-round pick that can become a first, The Athletic confirmed on Monday.
The draft pick could turn into a first if the Wild reach the Western Conference finals and Fleury wins at least four games in those rounds.
Fleury waived his no-trade clause to move to Minnesota, The Athletic confirmed.
But if not for Fleury, the Blackhawks would be even worse off than they are.
The Bruins dominated every facet of the game, but Fleury made 46 saves — several of them spectacular — to get the game to overtime and steal a point.

     Wild acquire Marc-Andre Fleury; Johansson back to Caps
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Minnesota gave up a conditional first-round pick in this year’s draft to acquire the 37-year-old Fleury hours before the NHL trade deadline on Monday.
The Wild opened the day sitting fourth overall — and third in the Central Division — in a tightly contested playoff race.
In acquiring Fleury, who won a Vezina Trophy a year ago with Vegas, Minnesota traded backup goalie Kaapo Kahkonen and a fifth-round draft pick to San Jose for defenseman Jake Middleton.
The Washington Capitals acquired Johansson from the expansion Seattle Kraken, in exchange for forward Daniel Sprong and two later-round draft picks.
— The Coyotes acquired unsigned forward prospect Nathan Smith and Bryan Little’s contract from the Winnipeg Jets for a 2022 fourth-round pick.

     Summary: The Wild then traded Kaapo Kahkonen to San Jose along with a fifth-round draft pick for Jacob Middleton.
If Middleton plays 21 of Minnesota's remaining 22 games he will be an RFA in the summer.
Cam Talbot and Kaapo Kahkonen had great starts to the season, but are showing signs of stumbling.
With Fleury in place, Talbot is looking at playing seven or eight of the remaining 22 games.
The Wild have Jonas Brodin, Alex Goligoski, Dmitry Kulikov, Jon Merrill, Jordie Benn and now Middleton who shoot left.
