     Urban Meyer made player cry, didn't know who Aaron Donald was: Details of disastrous Jaguars tenure emerge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A new report from The Athletic details the drama and downfall of Meyer's tenure, including his berating of staff and roster members — one time to the extent that it led to a player crying.
The Athletic reports that Meyer once "berated a player so harshly that the player cried" during a coaching and personnel meeting.
Meyer would leave the room, leaving the crying player to be consoled by members of the meeting.
The following day, The Athletic reports, Meyer and a staff member got into a "tense exchange" over the incident.
The report also says that Meyer was unfamiliar with some of the game's best players, including Rams defensive lineman Aaron Donald and 49ers wideout Deebo Samuel.

     More Trouble For Urban Meyer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Urban Meyer's attempt at coaching in the NFL went about as bad as it could possibly go, and reports like this continue to highlight why.
When it comes to college football, few can compare with Urban Meyer's success in terms of wins and losses.
In 2018, Meyer was placed on administrative leave after reports surfaced that he knew about spousal abuse allegations against assistant coach Zach Smith.
According to the report, Meyer was observing veteran wide out John Brown and rookie QB Trevor Lawrence going through a workout.
According to the report, Meyer would also routinely threaten to fire his players and coaches - leading to the following exchange: "And do you know what would happen if I cut you guys?

     Former Jaguars HC Urban Meyer’s tenure worse than originally thought
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saying that Urban Meyer’s tenure as the head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars was bad is an understatement but after a recent article by The Athletic, it might have been worse than it originally seemed and that’s saying something.
What was Jaguars owner Shad Khan thinking when he hired Urban Meyer?
When you are in a toxic relationship, red flags are just flags, and Jaguars owner Shad Khan was so fixated with Urban Meyer that he failed to see all his flaws.
Had there been a check-in-balance kind of system in place, things might have not been as bad but the former Jaguars head coach routinely abuse his power.
Meyer set the Jaguars back and it will be up to Doug Pederson, general manager Trent Baalke, and owner Shad Khan to clean the mess.

     Report: Urban Meyer was unfamiliar with Aaron Donald, other NFL stars while with Jaguars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to The Athletic, Meyer was unfamiliar with star players such as Aaron Donald and Deebo Samuel.
But multiple sources said Meyer was unfamiliar with star players around the league, including 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel, Seahawks safety Jamal Adams and Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald, a three-time NFL defensive player of the year.
“Who’s this 99 guy on the Rams?” Meyer asked one staffer during the season, according to a source.
“I’m hearing he might be a problem for us.”Anyone around the game of football knows who Aaron Donald is.
He’s arguably the best player in the world, and whether you’re coaching Pop Warner, high school, college or a team in the CFL, you know who the three-time Defensive Player of the Year is.

     Summary: (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong , File)JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – By now, most Jacksonville Jaguars fans know the Urban Meyer era was a complete disaster filled with embarrassing headlines and even more losses.
Reporters Jayson Jenks and Mike Sando spoke to multiple sources, including former Jaguars wide receiver D.J.
Chark, who said Meyer was belittling, demeaning, led by fear and created an extremely toxic work environment in the process.
Not even close.”Chark, who spent four seasons with the Jaguars before signing with the Lions last week, told The Athletic Meyer threatened to fire coaches in front of other players.
Former Jaguars player Josh Lambo said in a story to the Tampa Bay Times that Meyer kicked him during warmups and called special teams players derogatory names.

     Summary: Meyer is said to have been “unfamiliar with star players around the league,” as multiple sources told The Athletic – including future Hall of Fame defensive tackle Aaron Donald.
When it came to his own players and staffers, however, Meyer didn’t exactly instill confidence about their futures.
“Hey, Trevor, you’ve got to slow it down for him,” Meyer reportedly said to the two players.
The Jaguars have since hired former Eagles coach Doug Pederson as Meyer’s replacement.
Pederson has already received the stamp of approval from Lawrence, whom the Jaguars selected with the top pick in last year’s NFL Draft.

     Urban Meyer's NFL debacle: New details show that ex-Jaguars coach was a total disaster in Jacksonville
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The former Jaguars coach was canned in December after compiling just a 2-11 record in his first season.
The top overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft had an ugly rookie year, and according to Chark, that was mostly Meyer's fault.
According to the Athletic, Meyer once threatened to cut a guy for making a mistake in a preseason game.
One notable example of this came in December when Meyer through running backs coach Bernie Parmalee for a debacle involving James Robinson.
During his short time with the Jaguars, Meyer was also accused of kicking Josh Lambo in the leg and telling him to "make his f---ing kicks" just before a preseason game in August.
