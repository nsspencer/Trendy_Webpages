Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo of NFL Media reported Indy has acquired Ryan in exchange for a third-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft.

However, they aren’t the only club in the AFC South, let alone the conference that got better.
The Jaguars have their work cut out if they want to compete in the AFC South but they should be thrilled about Ryan’s addition to the AFC South which should push them to get better.
