     DJ LeMahieu on Trevor Story’s new deal: ‘It’s the one team I didn’t want him to go to’

     Summary: Two years later, he turned that ability to play third, first and second base — along with two superb offensive seasons — into a six-year, $90 million deal with the Bombers.
LeMahieu signed that deal with the Yankees expecting him to play second base, since Gleyber Torres was supposed to be the Bombers’ shortstop of the future.

     Yankees’ Aaron Judge doesn’t sound happy about Red Sox signing Trevor Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Yankees right fielder doesn’t sound happy about the Boston Red Sox signing former Colorado Rockies shortstop Trevor Story on Sunday.
Per MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand:Aaron Judge on Boston’s signing of Trevor Story: “I’m not too excited about it.
The 29-year-old Story, a two-time All-Star and two-time Silver Slugger Award winner, got a six-year, $140 million contract from the Red Sox, and will shift to second base since Boston already has an All-Star shortstop of its own in Xander Bogaerts.
Story’s signing closes the door on one of the best crop of free-agent shortstops in recent memory.
After the lockout, the Red Sox signed Story and the Minnesota Twins gave Carlos Correa a three-year, $105.3 million deal.

     Summary: The Giants were rumored to be one of the final teams in the mix for Story, who had a down year in 2021, which made him an obvious target for the fixer-upper Giants organization.
On another note, I’d like to leave you with this:Davey replaced Dusty in this job.
These games could be fraught matchup for Dusty and even for the Nats.

     Breaking Down Trevor Story Signing with the Boston Red Sox
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The gist of Coors Hangover Effect is that pitches at other ballparks have more movement than pitches at Coors due to the elevation decreasing pitch movement.
This is a major reason for the drastic home-road splits Rockies hitters experience.
He posted an .807 OPS compared to the .924 OPS he compiled between 2014 and 2019.
Since 2019, Fenway ranks second to Coors Field in overall Park Factor, albeit with less aggressive splits between home and road.
While the Rockies had a .174 OPS difference between home and road in 2021, the Red Sox had a .104 OPS difference in and out of Fenway.

     Trevor Story Signs 6-Year Deal with Boston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following an offseason marked more by departures than arrivals, the Boston Red Sox finally made their splash, landing superstar shortstop Trevor Story early Sunday morning.
Regardless of where he finds himself vis-à-vis second base, Story’s arrival to Boston brings with it a renewed opportunity for postseason baseball.
Story’s last playoff appearance was in 2018, the same year the Red Sox won the World Series.
In 2022, the Red Sox will be striving to compete in what projects to be a brutal race for the AL East.
Story’s talents with his bat, glove, and speed — especially should he return to MVP-candidate form — will be well-appreciated in Boston.

     Boston Red Sox: Pros and cons of the Trevor Story signing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Red Sox emerged from the shadows and finally got “real” in free agency with the signing of the former Colorado Rockies shortstop, Trevor Story.
The question that every Red Sox fan may be asking is, just how good is the signing?
Boston Red Sox pros in signing Trevor StoryStory has a pretty good reputation it seems around baseball.
Boston Red Sox cons of signing StoryThe first is fairly obvious; the Red Sox have a pretty good shortstop already on the team in Xander Bogaerts, at least for this season after which when he can opt-out of his current deal.
Presumably, the Red Sox did due diligence to be certain that he can throw the ball to first base from either position.

     Scattered thoughts on the Red Sox signing Trevor Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is an opt-out after the fourth season, which the Red Sox can negate if they so choose by adding a seventh year worth $20 million.
This is far and away the biggest move the Red Sox have made this winter, and the biggest they’ve made in a few years, so it’s time to dust off the scattered thoughts format.
I’ve also seen some speculation that the Red Sox could trade Bogaerts before the season.
At the deadline if it seems like he’s going to walk and the Red Sox are out of contention?
I’ve seen some talk about how this affects some of the top prospects in the Red Sox system like Marcelo Mayer and Nick Yorke.
