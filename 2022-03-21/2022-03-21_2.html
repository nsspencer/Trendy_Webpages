     The Boeing 737 Crash Isn’t Worrying the Market. How We Know.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A plane crash in China has clearly shaken investor confidence in Boeing.
But the rest of the aerospace supply chain is holding up better, which could mean the crash won’t drag down the industry like two deadly crashes of Boeing’s MAX model a few years ago.
A Boeing (ticker: BA) 738-800 jet operated by China Eastern Airlines crashed Monday in the mountains on a domestic flight.
The model was the prior version of the 737 dubbed Next Generation, or NG.
The MAX jets were grounded worldwide from March 2019 through...

     Boeing 737 passenger jet crashes in China with 132 people on board

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board plunged midflight and crashed in a mountainous area of southern China on Monday, according to officials and flight-tracking data.
China's Civil Aviation Administration said it was sending a team to the crash site in the Guangxi region.
Video circulating on social media showed fire and smoke in the mountains and a section of a plane near a dirt path.
The 737-800 that crashed Monday in China first flew in June 2015.
It was not a Boeing 737 Max, the plane that was grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.

     Chinese Boeing 737 With 132 Onboard Crashes After A Sudden Descent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Boeing 737-800 passenger airliner has crashed in southern China after descending from cruising altitude at a rate of 31,000 feet per minute.
Early reports suggest no sign of survivors among the 123 passengers and nine crew onboard as Chinese emergency services begin a search and rescue operation.
A graph of the 737's descent shows that the steep descent was briefly arrested below 10,000 feet before the crash.
Reuters, citing a People’s Daily state news report, says that a local fire department has found no signs of survivors among the 132 onboard.
China Eastern and Boeing have changed the colors of their sites in China to black and white in mourning of the crash.

     Summary: BEIJING (AP) — A China Eastern Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board crashed in southern China on Monday, officials said, in the country’s worst air disaster in nearly a decade.
The CAAC and China Eastern both said they had sent officials to the crash site in accordance with emergency measures.
Headquartered in Shanghai, China Eastern is one of China’s top three airlines, operating scores of domestic and international routes serving 248 destinations.
China Eastern Airlines uses the Boeing 737-800 as one of the main workhorses of its fleet — of its over 600 planes, 109 are Boeing 737-800s.
Boeing began delivering the 737-800 to customers in 1997 and delivered the last of the series to China Eastern in 2020.
