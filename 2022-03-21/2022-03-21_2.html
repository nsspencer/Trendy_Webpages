     The Boeing 737 Crash Isn’t Worrying the Market. How We Know.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A plane crash in China has clearly shaken investor confidence in Boeing.
But the rest of the aerospace supply chain is holding up better, which could mean the crash won’t drag down the industry like two deadly crashes of Boeing’s MAX model a few years ago.
A Boeing (ticker: BA) 738-800 jet operated by China Eastern Airlines crashed Monday in the mountains on a domestic flight.
The model was the prior version of the 737 dubbed Next Generation, or NG.
The MAX jets were grounded worldwide from March 2019 through...

     Boeing 737 passenger jet crashes in China with 132 people on board
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board plunged midflight and crashed in a mountainous area of southern China on Monday, according to officials and flight-tracking data.
China's Civil Aviation Administration said it was sending a team to the crash site in the Guangxi region.
Video circulating on social media showed fire and smoke in the mountains and a section of a plane near a dirt path.
The 737-800 that crashed Monday in China first flew in June 2015.
It was not a Boeing 737 Max, the plane that was grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.

     Chinese Boeing 737 With 132 Onboard Crashes After A Sudden Descent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Boeing 737-800 passenger airliner has crashed in southern China after descending from cruising altitude at a rate of 31,000 feet per minute.
Early reports suggest no sign of survivors among the 123 passengers and nine crew onboard as Chinese emergency services begin a search and rescue operation.
A graph of the 737's descent shows that the steep descent was briefly arrested below 10,000 feet before the crash.
Reuters, citing a People’s Daily state news report, says that a local fire department has found no signs of survivors among the 132 onboard.
China Eastern and Boeing have changed the colors of their sites in China to black and white in mourning of the crash.

     How Boeing is responding to the 737-800 crash in China
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: China Eastern Airlines has grounded all of its Boeing 737-800 planes after a flight carrying 132 people crashed in the city of Wuzhou en route from Kunming to Guangzhou today (March 21).
Today’s crash comes three years after another Boeing model, the 737 Max, was grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes within five months of each other.
Boeing expresses concern for China Eastern passengers and crew“Our thoughts are with the passengers and crew of China Eastern Airlines Flight MU 5735,” a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement to Quartz.
Neither China Eastern nor Boeing has identified the cause of the crash, and rescue efforts could be prolonged by inclement weather.
While the China Eastern crash involves a different aircraft, analysts told the New York Times Chinese government officials may hesitate to approve the 737 Max while investigating an incident that occurred on another Boeing plane.

     Summary: A Boeing 737-800 crashed in China with 132 people on board.
While Boeing has come under fire previously for crashes, it was the company's Boeing 737 Max that generated some of the harshest criticism over safety concerns.
In 2010, an Ethiopian Airlines flight, operated by a Boeing 737-800, crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in 98 deaths.
What's the difference between a Boeing 737-800 and a Boeing 737 Max?
He added the Boeing 737 Max was the first time he had seen the company cause a massive public scare.
