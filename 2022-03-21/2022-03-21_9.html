     Wild acquire Marc-Andre Fleury from Blackhawks – SKOR North
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mar 20, 2022; Chicago, Illinois, USA; Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury (29) makes a save during the third period against the Winnipeg Jets at the United Center.
Fleury and Wild general manager Bill Guerin were teammates in Pittsburgh, and Fleury was a member of three Stanley Cup championship teams with the Penguins.
The Athletic also reported the Wild was moving Kaapo Kahkonen and a fifth-round pick in a trade with San Jose.
The Wild will get back defenseman Jacob Middleton from the Sharks.
Second-rounder will be a first if the #mnwild win two rounds and Fleury wins at least 4 games in those rounds https://t.co/se6uNfjK0d — Michael Russo (@RussoHockey) March 21, 2022

The Washington Capitals acquired Johansson from the expansion Seattle Kraken, in exchange for forward Daniel Sprong and two later-round draft picks.
— The Coyotes acquired unsigned forward prospect Nathan Smith and Bryan Little’s contract from the Winnipeg Jets for a 2022 fourth-round pick.
