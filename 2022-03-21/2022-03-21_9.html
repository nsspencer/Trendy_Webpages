     La’el Collins signs three-year deal with the Cincinnati Bengals after his release from the Dallas Cowboys
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals have agreed to a three-year deal with offensive tackle La’el Collins, after his release from the Dallas Cowboys last week.
Collins spent his entire career thus far in Dallas, where he played right tackle and left guard over his six seasons with the Cowboys.
He has started in all but three games of the 74 he has played between 2015 to 2021.
The Cowboys released him on Thursday to save $10 million against the salary cap.

     Bengals land La'el Collins: Cincinnati agrees to 3-year deal with former Cowboys offensive tackle, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cincinnati Bengals made it all the way to the Super Bowl in 2021 despite a lackluster offensive line, so the front office made the position group a priority this offseason.
Their most recent addition is former Dallas Cowboys right tackle La'el Collins, who agreed to sign with Cincinnati on Sunday.
Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, Collins receives a three-year, $30 million deal that looks like a two-year, $20 million deal worth up to $22 million.
The Bengals' offensive line allowed Joe Burrow to be sacked 19 times in the playoffs, which is the most a quarterback has been sacked in a single postseason.
With new starters at center, right guard and right tackle, Cincy is going to have a chance to run it back in 2022.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI (AP) — The Cincinnati Bengals signed a third free-agent lineman to shore up an offensive line that has struggled to protect quarterback Joe Burrow.
The Bengals got their new right tackle on Sunday, signing former Dallas Cowboy La’el Collins to a three-year contract.
“We have three new guys that know how to set the tone,” said Frank Pollack, the Bengals’ offensive line coach.
Riley Reiff, who was signed by the Bengals to a one-year contract last year to play right tackle, likely won’t be re-signed.
The Bengals last week also signed free-agent tight end Hayden Hurst to a one-year contract following the departure of C.J.

     La'el Collins contract details with Bengals emerge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It turns out the Cincinnati Bengals called the bluff of the Dallas Cowboys by playing the waiting game on offensive tackle La’el Collins and then ended up signing him in free agency for essentially the same cash.
According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Collins’ deal is a three-year pact worth $30 million that, due to the structure, is really a two-year deal worth $22 million.
Cincinnati could have traded for Collins and put effectively the same contract on their books.
As Collins himself said after signing — and while also dropping an epic quote about Joe Burrow — the Bengals were always the smartest fit because of need, the overall team and his old coach Frank Pollack.
The Bengals accomplished this feat while other teams like the Patriots and Panthers tried to sign Collins, too.

While penalties have been an issue at times for Collins, he's allowed just four total sacks over the past two years combined.

He should be the best right tackle to play for the Bengals since Willie Anderson wore No.
He should provide upside and stability to the Bengals' offensive line and is immediately the best member unit.
