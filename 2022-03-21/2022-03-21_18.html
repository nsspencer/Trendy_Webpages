     Goodbye, Jamal Crawford
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Phoenix Suns guard and three-time Sixth Man of the Year award winner Jamal Crawford officially announced the end of his long career Monday, capping an NBA tenure in which he played for nine teams.
He became one of only six Suns to score 50 points in a game.
“‘Goodbye to the game, all the spoils the adrenaline rush.’ Thank you basketball, I owe you everything,” Crawford wrote in a Tweet.
Crawford joined the Suns in October 2018, signing a veteran minimum contract at the age of 38.
But on April 9, 2019, the final game of the Suns’ season, the 39 year-old scored 51 points in a loss to the Mavericks.

     Summary: Jamal Crawford’s NBA journey appears to have come to an end.
The 20-year NBA veteran, who played for 9 teams and 20 coaches during his career, thanked the game of basketball for “everything” in a Twitter post early Monday morning.
Crawford was a legendary ballhandler and playmaker, who brought energy and leadership to the many teams he played with throughout his career.
He last played with Brooklyn during the 2019-20 season, but he suffered an injury after only one game with the team.
In his last game with Phoenix Suns during the 2018-19 season, he scored 51 points to become the oldest player in NBA history to reach that mark in a single game.

     Jamal Crawford Retires After 20-Year NBA Career: What’s Next For Him?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Alex KennedyLast night, on his 42nd birthday, Jamal Crawford announced his retirement from the NBA.
Crawford is one of eight players in NBA history to play for 20 seasons; only Vince Carter (22), Robert Parish (21) and Kevin Willis (21) had a longer career.
Over the years, Crawford has done everything in his power to help up-and-coming Seattle-area players, even letting some live with him throughout his NBA career (including Isaiah Thomas, Nate Robinson and Abdul Gaddy among others).
Chicago Bulls star Zach LaVine raves about Crawford, and he now tries to help younger players just as Crawford helped him.
That would end up being Crawford’s final NBA game, as he remained unsigned throughout the 2021-22 season — even when COVID-19 ravaged rosters and created opportunities for other veterans.
