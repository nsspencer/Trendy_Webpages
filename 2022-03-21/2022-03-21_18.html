     NFL free agency 2022: Saints re-signing Jameis Winston following Deshaun Watson decision to join Browns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Within moments of Matt Ryan and the Atlanta Falcons shaking up the NFL, Jameis Winston has found an NFL home for 2022, and it's the same one he had the last two seasons.
They have now come to terms with the former first overall pick, agreeing to a two-year, $28 million deal, per CBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora.
Winston initially joined the Saints in 2020 as the backup to future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees, but was promoted to QB1 when Brees announced his retirement following that season.
He'll now get another shot to finish what he started last season, but he continues to rehab from his torn ACL with hopes of being ready for the start of the 2022 season.
The former Pro Bowler was always viewed as the Saints' backup plan in the event they lost out on Watson, and it appears Winston sat still to see how everything shook out before making the decision on where he might play in 2022.

     New Orleans Saints to re-sign QB Jameis Winston to two-year, $28 million deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Saints are bringing back quarterback Jameis Winston after missing out on their pursuit of Deshaun Watson.
Winston and the Saints agreed to two-year deal with a base value of $28 million, including $21 million guaranteed, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Monday.
The Saints were one of four teams vying to acquire Watson, who was ultimately traded to the Cleveland Browns.
Winston signed a one-year deal that was worth just $1.1 million plus incentives because he said he wanted to get a "Harvard education in quarterback school."
Winston signed another one-year deal with the Saints before the 2021 season that included $5.5 million in guarantees and up to $7 million in incentives after Brees retired.

     Instant analysis on Saints' 2-year contract with Jameis Winston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Saints have brought back Jameis Winston on a two-year deal worth up to $28 million.
That would actually rank as the 26th-most money tied up to the quarterback position, still slotting in between those two players.
The Saints should now give Winston at least one full season before looking to the draft again.
Winston views himself as a starter in this league still and wants to be paid like it; this deal works perfectly for both sides.
Should Winston prove his worth to the team he will then be locked up for the big money contract he has been searching for.

     Saints re-signing QB Jameis Winston to two-year, $28M deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New Orleans Saints are re-signing quarterback Jameis Winston to a two-year, $28 million contract with $21 million in guarantees, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero and Ian Rapoport reported Monday.
Winston's getting a $14 million signing bonus, per Rapoport.
The Texans agreed Friday to trade Watson to the Cleveland Browns, who, along with the Saints, Carolina Panthers and Atlanta Falcons had offered trade packages to Houston.
Possessing a live arm but a tendency with turnovers, Winston joined the Saints as Drew Brees' backup in 2020.
Through seven starts with Winston, the Saints were 5-2.
