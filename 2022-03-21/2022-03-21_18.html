    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After three years as quarterbacks coach before Rees’ elevation to offensive coordinator at the age of 28, head coach Brian Kelly handed the offense over to him.

It went something like this: Now that the Kelly shackles are off, we’ll see what Rees can do as the offensive coordinator.
“I have a tremendous amount of love and respect for Coach Kelly,” Rees said.
“Maybe day to day, I’m more sarcastic with people?” quipped Rees when probed about how things are different under Freeman.
