     Despite a Michael Bolton performance, 'American Song Contest' fails to fulfill its campy (Euro)vision
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Long before American Idol or The Voice — before Star Search, even — there was the Eurovision Song Contest.
So, now is the perfect time for a Stateside version of the competition, as singers representing 50 states and six U.S. territories compete for the title of Best Original Song on NBC’s American Song Contest.
But the burning, glittering question is, will American Song Contest (why it’s not called “Amerivision,” I do not friggin’ know) be as campy as its Euro predecessor?
Michael Bolton represents Connecticut on the premiere of 'American Song Contest.'
Her original song wasn’t at a Ronson level, but as a sexy and seasoned performer, she made it werk.
