     Summary: The Arizona Cardinals have done very little this off-season, but one thing they were able to do was add a young cornerback.
That’s why when Danny Kelly of “The Ringer” came out with his newest 2022 NFL Mock Draft, I was surprised with his pick.
Arizona Cardinals - Andrew Booth Jr., CB - Clemson“The Cardinals need to upgrade their talent and depth at cornerback.
He has the size and physicality to compete with receivers like DK Metcalf, Cooper Kupp, and Deebo Samuel.”Booth is a good cornerback, but I worry about his health.

     Twitter Erupts Over Noncall at End of Regulation As Arizona Beats TCU
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 9 TCU ended in an 85–80 overtime victory for the Wildcats, all eyes were directed at the NCAA’s officiating once again.
The Melendez technical was perhaps superseded by the noncall at half court at the end of regulation between the Wildcats and Horned Frogs on Sunday night.
TCU guard Mike Miles was being pressured heavily by Arizona guard Dalen Terry near half court as time waned.
With three seconds to play, Miles collided with Terry at half court, which caused an untimely turnover on what appeared to be a foul.
Ultimately, the noncall left another mark on a tough weekend for the officials at the NCAA tournament.

    </h2>

     Summary: The Arizona Cardinals did the right thing in cutting defensive tackle Jordan Phillips loose, but they still face a gaping hole at defensive tackle.
In 2020, the Arizona Cardinals seemingly had three fixtures at defensive tackle: Jordan Phillips and then-rookies Leki Fotu and Rashard Lawrence.
With what they have left on their roster after Phillips’ departure, the Cardinals need to upgrade their defensive tackle position in both free agency and the NFL Draft.
Arizona Cardinals need to sign at least two more defensive tackles this offseasonRight now, Fotu and Lawrence are the only two defensive tackles on the roster, and the Cardinals need at least two more bodies to fill the void.
They are not your typical interior defensive tackles, best suited at end or even on the edge in a 3-4.

     Summary: By JOE REEDY AP Sports WriterSAN DIEGO (AP) – Bennedict Mathurin has come through plenty in clutch situations for Arizona.
After getting the rebound and making the basket, Mathurin did a couple fist pumps near the baseline.
Chuck O’Bannon Jr. had a career-high 23 points for TCU (21-13) while Mike Miles Jr. and Eddie Lampkin Jr. had 20 apiece.
TCU still had a chance to win in regulation after Mathurin’s big shot, but Miles lost the ball near midcourt.
The Horned Frogs held Arizona scoreless for 5:09 before Terry’s 3 from the right corner tied it at 70.

     Summary: The TCU Horned Frogs had reason to gripe Sunday after an 85-80 overtime loss to the Arizona Wildcats in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
With the game tied up with the last possession of regulation, Arizona predicted TCU guard Mike Miles would be creating the final shot.
A bump from Miles’ defender, Dalen Terry, sent the Horned Frogs’ leading scorer flying across the halfcourt line — whether the contact was embellished or not.
TCU fans likely thought Miles fell because of a foul.
