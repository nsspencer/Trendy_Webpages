     New York Rangers sneak in just before deadline, complete deals for Andrew Copp, Tyler Motte
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Rangers completed two significant trades under the wire Monday, acquiring forward Andrew Copp and a 2023 sixth-round draft pick from the Winnipeg Jets and forward Tyler Motte from the Vancouver Canucks.
New York sent a 2023 fourth-round pick to the Canucks for Motte.
The Rangers traded to Winnipeg forward Morgan Barron, two conditional second-round picks and a 2023 fifth-round pick.
The other second-round choice will either be St. Louis' pick in 2022 or New York's pick in 2023.
New York didn't have much cap space ahead of the deadline, making short-term solutions such as Copp, Motte and Braun ideal additions.

     New York Rangers Acquire Andrew Copp from Winnipeg Jets for Morgan Barron and Draft Picks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Rangers have acquired forward Andrew Copp for the Winnipeg Jets for Morgan Barron and two second-round picks with conditions and options detailed below.
The Rangers are also sending a 2023 fifth-round pick to the Jets and getting Winnipeg’s 2023 sixth-rounder.
To NYR: Andrew Copp and a 6th in 2023.
He has plenty of experience killing penalties; he had the third-most shorthanded minutes for the Jets this season with 138:27, or 2:28 per game.
Based on the Jets’ power-play shot metrics with Copp on the ice, he could give the Rangers’ second power-play unit a boost.
