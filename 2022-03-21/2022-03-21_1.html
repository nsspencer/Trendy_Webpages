     Reports: Red Sox sign Rockies SS Trevor Story to play 2B
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) — The Red Sox have reportedly agreed to terms with Rockies All-Star shortstop Trevor Story on a six-year, $140 million contract that would bring him to Boston to play second base.
The deal gives the Red Sox a long-term answer at second.
The position has been in flux since former AL MVP Dustin Pedroia was first injured in 2017.
It also leaves Xander Bogaerts in place at shortstop and gives the team a backup plan on the left side of the infield if Bogaerts opts out of his contract at the end of this season.
The deal was first reported by USA Today and confirmed by multiple outlets.

     Yankees’ Aaron Judge doesn’t sound happy about Red Sox signing Trevor Story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New York Yankees right fielder doesn’t sound happy about the Boston Red Sox signing former Colorado Rockies shortstop Trevor Story on Sunday.
Per MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand:Aaron Judge on Boston’s signing of Trevor Story: “I’m not too excited about it.
The 29-year-old Story, a two-time All-Star and two-time Silver Slugger Award winner, got a six-year, $140 million contract from the Red Sox, and will shift to second base since Boston already has an All-Star shortstop of its own in Xander Bogaerts.
Story’s signing closes the door on one of the best crop of free-agent shortstops in recent memory.
After the lockout, the Red Sox signed Story and the Minnesota Twins gave Carlos Correa a three-year, $105.3 million deal.

     3 Questions Trevor Story Will Have To Answer With Red Sox
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Boston Red Sox made a big splash over the weekend, as they inked infielder Trevor Story to a major deal.
https://t.co/EyyGN9fpgM — Bob Nightengale (@BNightengale) March 20, 2022The Red Sox exceeded expectations in the 2021 season, and they’re clearly ready to take another step forward in 2022.
Those are things that Story will have to navigate during his time in a Red Sox uniform.
That’s about to change, as he’ll shift over to second base with the Red Sox.
If he can merely be serviceable at second base while producing well at the plate, that’s something the Red Sox will certainly be happy with.

On another note, I’d like to leave you with this:Davey replaced Dusty in this job.
These games could be fraught matchup for Dusty and even for the Nats.

     Trevor Story Signs 6-Year Deal with Boston
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following an offseason marked more by departures than arrivals, the Boston Red Sox finally made their splash, landing superstar shortstop Trevor Story early Sunday morning.
Regardless of where he finds himself vis-à-vis second base, Story’s arrival to Boston brings with it a renewed opportunity for postseason baseball.
Story’s last playoff appearance was in 2018, the same year the Red Sox won the World Series.
In 2022, the Red Sox will be striving to compete in what projects to be a brutal race for the AL East.
Story’s talents with his bat, glove, and speed — especially should he return to MVP-candidate form — will be well-appreciated in Boston.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is an opt-out after the fourth season, which the Red Sox can negate if they so choose by adding a seventh year worth $20 million.
This is far and away the biggest move the Red Sox have made this winter, and the biggest they’ve made in a few years, so it’s time to dust off the scattered thoughts format.
I’ve also seen some speculation that the Red Sox could trade Bogaerts before the season.
At the deadline if it seems like he’s going to walk and the Red Sox are out of contention?
I’ve seen some talk about how this affects some of the top prospects in the Red Sox system like Marcelo Mayer and Nick Yorke.
