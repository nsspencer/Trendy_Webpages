     Boeing 737 passenger jet crashes in China with 132 people on board
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board plunged midflight and crashed in a mountainous area of southern China on Monday, according to officials and flight-tracking data.
China's Civil Aviation Administration said it was sending a team to the crash site in the Guangxi region.
Video circulating on social media showed fire and smoke in the mountains and a section of a plane near a dirt path.
The one that crashed Monday in China first flew in June 2015.
It was not a Boeing 737 Max, the plane that was grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.

     Chinese Boeing 737 With 132 Onboard Crashes After A Sudden Descent
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Boeing 737-800 passenger airliner has crashed in southern China after descending from cruising altitude at a rate of 31,000 feet per minute.
Early reports suggest no sign of survivors among the 123 passengers and nine crew onboard as Chinese emergency services begin a search and rescue operation.
A graph of the 737's descent shows that the steep descent was briefly arrested below 10,000 feet before the crash.
Reuters, citing a People’s Daily state news report, says that a local fire department has found no signs of survivors among the 132 onboard.
China Eastern and Boeing have changed the colors of their sites in China to black and white in mourning of the crash.
