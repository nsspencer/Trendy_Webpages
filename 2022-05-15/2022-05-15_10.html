    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A few players who left the Jets in free agency this offseason will immediately get a chance to see their old squad in 2022.
Players switch teams all the time, but seeing your former teammates and coaches the same year you left them always adds a little bit of motivation and intrigue to a matchup.
Now that we know New York’s schedule, here’s a look at five recent Jets departures who could face Gang Green this upcoming season.

     Summary: Another day, another “The Jets should totally trade Corey Davis” article.
Sure, if the Jets are completely bowled over by an extremely generous offer nearly anyone could be traded.
Unless he suffers through another nightmare season like last year, Corey Davis isn’t getting cut next year either.

     Ex-Jets Scout Evaluates New York’s 2022 Schedule
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This former Jets scout makes some bold statements while evaluating New York's schedule for this upcoming season.
The New York Jets got hammered in their newly released schedule.
This is the National Football League and the top General Managers need to be able to play whatever hand they are dealt.
Back when I was with the Jets and Bill Parcells was there, the team was turned around in two seasons.
That’s the lineup the Jets face in their first 10 games.

     New York Jets' Zach Wilson uses offseason to build body and chemistry
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When he wasn't throwing to his receivers on his "Zach Across America Tour," the second-year quarterback was working on his body.
He was the Jets' special teams coach from 2001 to 2012, an X's-and-O's whiz who never shied away from speaking his mind.
He covers everyone from Tim Tebow ("not an NFL quarterback") to Mark Sanchez ("only a manageable quarterback at best"), also touching on the two general managers and three coaches he worked under.
While under contract to the Jets, Westhoff, who had "retired" for health reasons, visited a Miami Dolphins training-camp practice as a guest of Parcells.
A few days later, Westhoff rejoined the Jets, who were preparing to open against Miami.
