     Jason Momoa apologizes in viral video after taking photos in the Sistine Chapel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jason Momoa, star of “Aquaman,” released a video on Instagram to apologize for taking photos in the Sistine Chapel.
The 42-year-old Momoa said the photos weren’t a sign of disrespect, but that was the way the post was taken as visitors are not allowed to take pictures in the Vatican City chapel.
Momoa is currently in Rome shooting “Fast X”, the 10th in the “Fast &amp; Furious” film saga.
The actor posted pictures of himself below the Michelangelo paintings on May 9.
He wrote, “I LOVE YOU ITALY what a beautiful start to our day off enjoying ROMA.”On Saturday, Momoa posted another video - while shirtless and working out - in which he addressed the controversy.

     Summary: (CNN) "Aquaman" star Jason Momoa took to Instagram to apologize for taking photos in the Sistine Chapel -- by posting a sweaty, shirtless workout video.
Momoa, 42, is currently in Rome shooting "Fast X", the 10th installment in the "Fast &amp; Furious" film saga.
But disgruntled fans quickly pointed out in the comments that visitors are typically forbidden from taking photos or videos in the chapel, which is located in Vatican City.
On Saturday, Momoa posted another video in which he addressed the controversy -- after a brief moment of working out.
"It's my last day in Rome, and I just love you and Italy," he said after setting down the dumbbells.
