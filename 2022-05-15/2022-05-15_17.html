     Albert Pujols amazingly pitches, gives up two Giants homers in Cardinals' win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants' game against the Cardinals in St. Louis on Sunday got out of hand early and by the end, there was position player-turned-pitcher hitting a homer off a future Hall of Fame slugger-turned-pitcher.
With the Cardinals in firm control of their eventual 15-6 win over the Giants, both teams used positions players on the mound late in the blowout.
The all-time great has hit 681 career homers and now has allowed two long balls.
The Giants didn't have much fun during Sunday's blowout loss, but some of the players did seem to enjoy watching Pujols pitch.
Hopefully for the Giants, they can carry the home run swagger into their three-game series against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field beginning on Monday night.

Example video title will go here for this videoST. LOUIS — St. Louis Cardinals legend Albert Pujols has done pretty much everything in his major league career.
Pujols took the mound in the ninth inning with the Cardinals leading 15-2 against the San Francisco Giants.

Pujols got LaMonte Wade Jr. to ground out to Brendan Donovan to finish the inning, and the game.

     Summary: And by the end of the Cardinals’ 15-6 win, Albert Pujols, a projected first-ballot Hall of Famer, was pitching.
Rodón, San Francisco’s starter, hadn’t allowed a first-pitch hit all year.
That was the first homer Rodón has allowed this season, ending a streak of 171 batters faced without one.
Boom, St. Louis had four quick runs off Rodón, who hadn’t allowed more than two in his first six starts of the season.
“It wasn’t very good,” said Rodón, who will take a look at the whole outing, including if he might have tipped any pitches.
