     Summary: Suffice it to say, K.H.
Lee knows from going low at TPC Craig Ranch.
A year ago, the South Korean won the tournament in McKinney, Texas, with a 25-under total.
This time, he did one better, shooting a 26-under 262 after posting a nine-under 63 in the final round.
It was good enough to pass 54-hole leader Sebastian Munoz and hold off local favorite Jordan Spieth to become the tournament’s fourth repeat champion (joining Sam Snead, Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson) and the third golfer to successfully defend a tournament title during the 2021-22 PGA Tour season.

     Summary: McKINNEY, Texas – On the 17th green, staring over a 12-foot par putt to maintain a one-stroke lead at the AT&amp;T Byron Nelson, K.H.
He drained a 15-foot birdie putt at No.
He did well to chip it past the hole, praying before making his clutch left-to-right twisting par putt to protect a 1-shot edge.
No less than Jordan Spieth called Lee’s putting stroke “pure.”“That’s some high praise coming from Jordan,” observed CBS’s Colt Knost.
But this was Lee’s day for the second straight year, and he celebrated just off the 18th green with his parents, wife Joo Yeon and 10-month old Celene.

     2022 AT&amp;T Byron Nelson leaderboard, grades: K.H. Lee repeats after holding off challenge from Jordan Spieth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As of Sunday, they're the only golfers in history to win the AT&amp;T Byron Nelson multiple years in a row.
It took a 63 from Lee on Sunday – the lowest round of his career – to ward off Jordan Spieth (2nd), Hideki Matsuyama (T3), Justin Thomas (T5) and Xander Schauffele (T5).
Incredibly, it wasn't the best round of the day Sunday at the Nelson, nor was it the best round of those players listed.
Spieth and Lee both birdied that 72nd, and Lee disappointed a gallery hoping to Spieth win his hometown tournament for the first time and Spieth licking his wounds before he goes for the career grand slam next week at the PGA Championship.
Xander Schauffele (-23): When Schauffele ended his final round, he was the solo leader and 100-1 to win the tournament.
