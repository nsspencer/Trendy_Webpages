     Kurt Busch wins NASCAR Cup Series at Kansas for Michael Jordan's 23XI Racing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was the second win for the up-and-coming 23XI Racing team owned by Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin, who followed the two leaders and Kyle Busch across in fourth place.
Just as Byron limped down pit road, outside pole sitter Tyler Reddick had a rear go down and touched the wall.
Erik Jones had a different tire problem entirely: His team couldn't get a rear lug nut off.
His older brother, Kurt, beat him to the line to win the second stage with Elliott again coming across in third.
UP NEXTThe series takes a regular-season break before the Coca-Cola 600 and heads to Texas for next weekend's All-Star race.

     Fantasy Update: Strong Saturday at Kansas for Christopher Bell, Kurt Busch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even so, several of the projected frontrunners for the 400-miler came to play, with Christopher Bell earning his third pole of the season.
Earlier this week, I said to stay away from Kurt Busch this weekend, as the No.
Though he has three wins at Kansas, Logano will start from behind on Sunday.
FEATURED MATCHUPS:Joey Logano vs. William Byron: What a coincidence that these two drivers are matched up against each other this weekend.
As noted above, Harvick’s team is starting from behind with a disappointing 23rd-place starting position.

     Kurt Busch can finally click his heels: earns first Cup win at Kansas and now is on hunt for Toto
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And Kurt Busch is definitely a man of consistency.
The Las Vegas native became the 11th different winner in NASCAR Cup this season, earning the 34th win of his Cup career in Sunday’s Advent Health 400 at Kansas Speedway.
I had to beat both (his brother Kyle Busch and defending Cup Series champ Kyle Larson).”And beat both Kyles he did.
Heck, Kurt even brought team co-owner and Cup racing rival, Denny Hamlin, to tears as the 23XI team captured its second career Cup win Sunday (Wallace captured the team’s first triumph last year at Talladega).
I’ve never had certainly this kind of feeling, even for a win for me when I did win.

     Kurt Busch wins Kansas in 23XI banner day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As many drivers suffered tyre failures, Toyota thrived in Sunday’s NASCAR Cup Series race at Kansas Speedway.
All six Toyota cars finished in the top ten, with Kurt Busch leading the way as he held off Kyle Larson to win his first race as a member of 23XI Racing.
Entering Kansas, 23XI Racing had been slugging through a challenging season as Busch and team-mate Bubba Wallace were outside the top twenty in points.
At the front, Bell’s downed tyre led to Kyle Busch winning the first stage.
With nine laps remaining, Busch cleared Larson for the lead and would score his thirty-fourth Cup victory and first at Kansas.
