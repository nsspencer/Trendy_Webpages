     A Fringe Conspiracy Theory, Fostered Online, Is Refashioned by the G.O.P.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inside a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, a white man with a history of antisemitic internet posts gunned down 11 worshipers, blaming Jews for allowing immigrant “invaders” into the United States.
The next year, another white man, angry over what he called “the Hispanic invasion of Texas,” opened fire on shoppers at an El Paso Walmart, leaving 23 people dead, and later telling the police he had sought to kill Mexicans.
And in yet another deadly mass shooting, unfolding in Buffalo on Saturday, a heavily armed white man is accused of killing 10 people after targeting a supermarket on the city’s predominantly Black east side, writing in a lengthy screed posted online that the shoppers there came from a culture that sought to “ethnically replace my own people.”Three shootings, three different targets — but all linked by one sprawling, ever-mutating belief now commonly known as replacement theory.
At the extremes of American life, replacement theory — the notion that Western elites, sometimes manipulated by Jews, want to “replace” and disempower white Americans — has become an engine of racist terror, helping inspire a wave of mass shootings in recent years and fueling the 2017 right-wing rally in Charlottesville, Va., that erupted in violence.

     Summary: WALLACE: White supremacists, white supremacists, and right-wing militia.
Instead of rejecting, Trump actively urged the white supremacists The Proud Boys to “stand by” for future instructions.
New York Times reporter Nicholas Confessore wrote a very lengthy expose of Carlson and his racist fear-mongering recently.
When asked by NPR which racist theory did Carlson focus on most, Confessore said “replacement theory”, noting Carlson had referred to it in no less than 400 of his shows.
Trump and Carlson are enabling and encouraging hate speech in America.

     Tucker Carlson claims domestic terrorism ‘doesn’t exist’ in resurfaced video following Buffalo shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Controversial Fox News host Tucker Carlson has once again sparked a wave of public condemnation online – this time over previous comments on domestic terrorism which have resurfaced following a shooting in Buffalo, New York on Saturday.
However, it is comments from Mr Biden warning of domestic terrorism which Carlson has targeted in the past, with a video from an episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight in January being reshared to social media on Saturday night.
“Where exactly is all this ‘criminal white supremacy’, this right-wing domestic terrorism that poses ‘the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland’?
Well, ‘cause it doesn’t exist,” Carlson said, in a clip posted by Twitter user Acyn.

     Summary: However, some people still don’t know much about abortion laws in the USA.
Neither about how they vary from state to state and even sometimes from region to region within the same state!
Here are five surprising facts about abortion laws in the USA that you may not have known before now.
2) State Level Restrictions on Medicaid Funding for AbortionsMedicaid is not allowed to use federal funding for abortions except under very specific circumstances.
In fact, legislation has made it so that women of color are disproportionately affected by recent changes made to abortion laws.

     Buffalo Suspect Embraced Racist 'Replacement' Conspiracy Pushed By Tucker Carlson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bystanders gather under an umbrella as rain rolls in after a mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, Saturday.
Almost all of the victims in the mass shooting were Black.
In September, Media Matters reported that Carlson launched a “dedicated campaign to insert the ‘great replacement’ conspiracy theory … into mainstream Republican discourse.”The conspiracy motivated white nationalists who marched in 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia (who were described as “very fine people” by then-President Donald Trump).
Advertisement“It is the most mass-violence-inspiring idea in white supremacist circles right now,” Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, told the Times.
“A racially motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation,” Biden said in a statement Saturday after the shooting.

     Buffalo shooting: Anti-racism experts condemn ‘great replacement’ conspiracy pushed by Tucker Carlson and GOP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a manifesto verified by several news outlets as belonging to the shooting suspect, the 18-year-old clearly links his aims to reversing a trend that has been coined by white supremacist conspiracy theorists as the “white replacement theory”.
But experts on hate and disinformation agree that the rhetoric Carlson and other Republican-aligned figures have espoused is playing into such racist beliefs shifting closer to the mainstream.
Tucker is just capitalizing on it.”Many disagree on how to handle the rhetoric being increasingly spread by the far right.
Others, like the Anti-Defamation League, took the exact opposite response and are calling for Democrats to pass legislation aimed at battling white supremacist beliefs on the airwaves and online.
“This was yet another predictable attack by an avowed white supremacist who imbibed hateful conspiracy theories online and then turned to violent action, this time targeting mostly Black victims.

     Mass shooting in Buffalo: Tucker Carlson and other right-wing conspiracy theorists share the blame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The "great replacement" theory has been a favorite of Carlson's for some time now.
Carlson doesn't actually say "Jews," and generally blames the sinister plan on Democrats, socialists or unspecified "elites," but otherwise has kept the conspiracy theory intact.
This only encourage his viewers to embrace the conspiracy theory even more, telling themselves that they (and he) are bold truth-tellers fighting against the forces of liberal oppression.
After all, this is just the latest in a series of mass shootings inspired by the "great replacement" theory, including the Walmart shooting in El Paso that left 23 dead and the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh in which 11 people died.
Since those massacres, the "great replacement" theory has only become more popular with Republican voters, largely thanks to Carlson and similar figures on the right.
