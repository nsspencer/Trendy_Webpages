     Dejan Kulusevski One Of Four Tottenham Players Hit By Viral "Stomach Problem"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dejan Kulusevski One Of Four Tottenham Players Hit By Viral "Stomach Problem"Tottenham Hotspur's squad was infiltrated by a stomach bug ahead of Sunday's Premier League home game against Burnley.
Spurs manager Antonio Conte revealed in a pre-match interview that Dejan Kulusevski was one of four players who had reported symptoms including sickness on Saturday.
"Honestly, there was a problem because yesterday Kulusevski didn't do the training session.
"Yesterday four players but it is ok. Kulusevski didn't have the training session, but we have Lucas Moura."
Hours before that game, Tottenham requested a postponement after a significant number of players reported having food poisoning, apparently as a consequence of a dodgy lasagna.

     Summary: A contested Harry Kane penalty gave Tottenham Hotspur a 1-0 Premier League win over relegation-threatened Burnley on Sunday, moving Antonio Conte's team into a Champions League qualification place.
"Burnley were the perfect team to test our nerves," Conte said.
"I'm not sure that if we face this game three months ago we can celebrate three points at the end of the game.
But Spurs were forced to defend deep in the closing stages as Burnley pumped crosses into the area in the hope of a late equaliser.
Burnley travel to Aston Villa on Thursday before hosting Newcastle United at Turf Moor.

     Summary: “I don’t think it is a penalty,” their caretaker manager, Mike Jackson, said.
I don’t know if the referee has played football before.”Harry Kane scores Tottenham’s winner from the penalty spot.
Tottenham had begun as if turbo-charged by the destruction of Arsenal, zipping the ball around and attacking in waves.
“Don’t forget we played [three] days ago in a tough game against Arsenal, and before that in Anfield against Liverpool,” he said.
On top of that Conte had not bargained for a sickness bug that meant Dejan Kulusevski could not start the game.

     Tottenham vs Burnley: Player ratings and analysis as Spurs keep pressure on Arsenal after Kane penalty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley (Kane pen 45+5′)TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM — Whatever risk there was that Tottenham Hotspur would blow their newly acquired momentum in the race to qualify for the Champions League took until the very end of a nervous, tetchy win against Burnley to fully dissipate.
For the first 15 minutes, Burnley could not get out of their half.
It took Burnley 23 minutes to get a spell of possession in Tottenham’s half, and when they did they threatened.
A protracted VAR check yielded a penalty which Kane duly dispatched past Pope in the eighth minute of stoppage time.
That is good and he came off the bench and I hope he is ready to come in.”In positive news for Spurs, Kulusevski was healthy enough to be introduced as a 78th-minute substitute for the ineffectual Lucas Moura.
