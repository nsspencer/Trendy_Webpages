     Machine Gun Kelly sparks marriage, pregnancy rumors with Megan Fox at BBMAs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reps for the couple didn’t immediately return Page Six’s request for comment about whether they’re married and/or expecting their first child together.
Instead, Kelly, 32, said they’d be celebrating Fox’s 37th birthday at midnight.
The pair, who matched in spikes and sparkles at the awards show, got engaged in January at the Ritz-Carlton Dorado Beach in Puerto Rico.
“And just as in every lifetime before this one, and as in every lifetime that will follow it, I said yes … and then we drank each other’s blood,” Fox wrote on Instagram at the time.
“It’s just a few drops, but yes, we do consume each other’s blood on occasion for ritual purposes only.”

     Machine Gun Kelly Dedicates 2022 BBMAs Performance to ‘Wife’ and ‘Unborn Child’

     Summary: Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for MRCNot to be outdone by Kravis today, Machine Gun Kelly dedicated his Billboard Music Awards performance of “Twin Flame” to his wife, adding “and this is for our unborn child.” Last time we checked, Colson was still only engaged to Megan Fox (with an engagement ring that hurts to take off, because love is pain).
“Twin Flame” is an important song in MGK fandom.
Neither Kelly nor Fox have ever confirmed the theories.
The lovebirds have been engaged since January of this year, and celebrated that by drinking just a little bit of each other’s blood.
MGK noted on the red carpet that tonight is a total lunar eclipse in Scorpio, which is just so …them.
