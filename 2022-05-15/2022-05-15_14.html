     Veteran Chicago cop jumps into mayor’s race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Longtime Chicago police officer Frederick Collins announced his second run for mayor on Sunday, joining a growing cast of candidates looking to make the city’s crime problem a key campaign issue in their efforts to unseat Mayor Lori Lightfoot.
Collins previously ran for mayor in 2015, but withdrew from the ballot while facing a challenge to his nominating petitions.
Before that, he lost the Republican primary in his 2012 bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.).
Then, in 2016, he ran as a Democrat when he challenged Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.) but withdrew ahead of the primary.
Collins has faced 40 complaints as a cop, more than 94% of other officers, according to the Invisible Institute, a nonprofit that compiles data on police misconduct.

It is difficult at this point to know which signings, trades, draft picks, etc.
Before we discuss these underrated moves, let’s take a quick look back at some of the big moves that Ryan Poles has made this offseason.
It appears that many Chicago Bears fans now believe that Khalil Mack is not an elite player.
