     Veteran Chicago cop jumps into mayor’s race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Longtime Chicago police officer Frederick Collins announced his second run for mayor on Sunday, joining a growing cast of candidates looking to make the city’s crime problem a key campaign issue in their efforts to unseat Mayor Lori Lightfoot.
Collins previously ran for mayor in 2015, but withdrew from the ballot while facing a challenge to his nominating petitions.
Before that, he lost the Republican primary in his 2012 bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.).
Then, in 2016, he ran as a Democrat when he challenged Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.) but withdrew ahead of the primary.
Collins has faced 40 complaints as a cop, more than 94% of other officers, according to the Invisible Institute, a nonprofit that compiles data on police misconduct.

The Sox didn’t have another baserunner against Yankees starter Nestor Cortes until a two-out single by Tim Anderson in the sixth.
“At times we do a little more chasing, especially before two strikes when the count is in our favor,” La Russa said.
White Sox starter Dallas Keuchel pitches against the Yankees during the first inning Saturday, May 14, 2022, at Guaranteed Rate Field.
And I appreciate the competitor being disappointed.”The score is one factor La Russa looks at in those situations.

     Lightfoot bans unaccompanied minors from Millennium Park on weekend evenings after fatal shooting near ‘The Bean’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following another night of springtime chaos downtown, Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Sunday announced she’s banning minors from Millennium Park on weekend evenings unless they’re accompanied by an adult.
“Tragically, a young person — a teenager — lost his life last night in Millennium Park,” Lightfoot said in a statement Sunday announcing the 6 p.m. curfew.
We simply will not accept anything less.”Chicago police block traffic near State and Monroe streets late Saturday after crowds of young people flooded the Loop.
Crowds flock to “The Bean” on Sunday, a day after a 16-year-old boy was fatally shot near the iconic attraction.
Lightfoot called Saturday’s fatal shooting “utterly unacceptable.”“Tonight, a mother is grief-stricken, mourning the loss of her child and searching for answers,” Lightfoot said.
