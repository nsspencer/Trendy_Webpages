     Unaccompanied Minors Banned From Millennium Park on Weekend Evenings After Fatal Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Under new guidance issued by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, unaccompanied minors will be banned from Millennium Park on weekend evenings after a 16-year-old boy was shot and killed near “The Bean” on Saturday evening.
The new rule will go into effect immediately, and will ban unaccompanied minors under the age of 18 from visiting the park after 6 p.m. Thursday through Sunday.
“This new policy will be strictly enforced and violations will be dealt with swiftly,” Lightfoot said in a statement.
The move comes after a shooting left a 16-year-old dead during a massive gathering in Millennium Park on Saturday night.
Police worked to clear the park after the shooting, but skirmishes occurred in numerous other locations throughout the Loop.

     Teenager gunned down near Chicago tourist attraction

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago’s mayor promised new measures to combat violence after a 16-year-old boy was fatally shot near “The Bean” sculpture in downtown Millennium Park, which is among the city’s most popular tourist attractions.
Police said the teen was shot in the chest at about 7:30 p.m. Saturday near the giant, mirrored structure.
At least two suspects were taken in for questioning, and at least two weapons were recovered, authorities said.

     Veteran Chicago cop jumps into mayor’s race
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Longtime Chicago police officer Frederick Collins announced his second run for mayor on Sunday, joining a growing cast of candidates looking to make the city’s crime problem a key campaign issue in their efforts to unseat Mayor Lori Lightfoot.
Collins previously ran for mayor in 2015, but withdrew from the ballot while facing a challenge to his nominating petitions.
Before that, he lost the Republican primary in his 2012 bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.).
Then, in 2016, he ran as a Democrat when he challenged Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.) but withdrew ahead of the primary.
Collins has faced 40 complaints as a cop, more than 94% of other officers, according to the Invisible Institute, a nonprofit that compiles data on police misconduct.

     Lightfoot bans unaccompanied minors from Millennium Park on weekend evenings after fatal shooting near ‘The Bean’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following another night of springtime chaos downtown, Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Sunday announced she’s banning minors from Millennium Park on weekend evenings unless they’re accompanied by an adult.
“Tragically, a young person — a teenager — lost his life last night in Millennium Park,” Lightfoot said in a statement Sunday announcing the 6 p.m. curfew.
Police said charges are pending for a 17-year-old who was taken into custody and found with a gun after the shooting.
Crowds flock to “The Bean” on Sunday, a day after a 16-year-old boy was fatally shot near the iconic attraction.
Lightfoot called Saturday’s fatal shooting “utterly unacceptable.”“Tonight, a mother is grief-stricken, mourning the loss of her child and searching for answers,” Lightfoot said.
