     Summary: "It's so weird, yet so natural, to be in front of (the fans), our chosen family for 38 years," Wynonna Judd said near the end of the 75-minute, CMT-aired memorial event for her mother, Naomi Judd, on Sunday at Ryman Auditorium.
Naomi Judd never met a stranger, her husband, Larry Strickland, said while flanked by Ashley and Wynonna Judd, onstage.

The icon added, "Naomi Judd (achieved) a rooted connection to all of us, and left a 'heart print' on our hearts."
