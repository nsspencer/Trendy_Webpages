     Conversations With Friends review – TV so slow it must be trolling us
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is a moment a few episodes into Conversations With Friends (BBC Three), the adaptation of Sally Rooney’s debut novel, when it seems as if the makers are deliberately trolling viewers.
He’s starring in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof – “It’s a proper play,” he says, “where stuff happens.” Conversations With Friends is almost aggressively the opposite.
Now Birch, writing alone this time, and Abrahamson (directing seven episodes, and Leanne Welham the other five) have reunited.
Cool, confident Bobbi (Sasha Lane) and Frances (newcomer Alison Oliver), whose attempts at cynical poses only highlight her naivety, are best friends who dated at school and have just graduated.
When Frances balks at Bobbi telling her she has a shiny face, Bobbi hastens to reassure her.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Like, maybe there needs to be conditions,” ponders Frances, the 21-year-old protagonist of Conversations with Friends, in episode 4 of Hulu’s adaptation of Sally Rooney’s debut novel.
Premiering on May 15, Conversations with Friends follows Frances (newcomer Alison Oliver), an intelligent yet immature college student living in Dublin, as she navigates a nexus of complex relationships.
One being ex-girlfriend—now best friend and roommate—Bobbi (Sasha Lane), and another with new friends, Nick (Joe Alwyn) and Melissa (Jemima Kirke)—a married couple whose union has somehow endured despite Melissa’s affairs and Nick’s looming depression.
“It’s Never Just Friends” ominously warns the series tagline, and within the first episode, it’s made explicitly clear that this foursome is anything but just friends.
AdvertisementWell, one will just have to file those under the conversations to have with their friends—and hopefully, partners.

So far, I feel like the show isn’t totally selling us on why exactly these two are still friends post-breakup, given the way Bobbi treats Frances.
Bobbi and Frances have the easy intimacy of people who are used to falling asleep on each other’s couches and in each other’s arms.
Nick gets Frances’s email so he can send her a ticket and, more importantly, so their emotionally inappropriate pen-pal relationship can commence.
I assume this is a sort of save-the-cat situation to endear us to Bobbi, but the episode has not really set us up to think she’s a very good friend, no?
