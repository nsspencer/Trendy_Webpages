     West Ham 2-2 Man City Highlights: Watch All The Goals Plus Lukasz Fabianski's Penalty Save
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: West Ham 2-2 Man City Highlights: Watch All The Goals Plus Lukasz Fabianski's Penalty SaveJack Grealish led a dramatic comeback at the London Stadium as Manchester City kept their Premier League title destiny in their own hands.
Two Jarrod Bowen goals had given West Ham a 2-0 lead at half time, allowing Liverpool supporters to believe that the EPL title race could be blown wide open.
But Grealish pulled one back early in the second half, before a Vladimir Coufal own goal helped City salvage a 2-2 draw.
The result could have been much better for City, who were awarded a late penalty kick.
West Ham were twice gifted golden chances to make it 3-1 by defensive blunders from Zinchenko and then Fernandinho.

(1:02)Riyad Mahrez missed a late penalty as Manchester City slipped up in the Premier League title race after drawing 2-2 at West Ham United on Sunday.
"It would have been perfect to win today but West Ham is fighting for Europa League and have had an incredible season.
Pep Guardiola endured a frustrating afternoon as he saw his team slip to a 2-2 draw at West Ham.
Mahrez stepped up but the penalty was saved by Fabianski as West Ham managed to hold on for the point.

     West Ham vs. Man City score: Guardiola's men rally for a point but see win slip away on Mahrez's missed PK
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski read it the whole way, saving the penalty from Mahrez to see the points shared.
Along with Laporte, he was caught out of position multiple times while allowing West Ham to get off shots en route to their two goals.
A slightly better defensive performance and City wouldn't have to sweat on the final day.
Guardiola doesn't have many choices but with Aston Villa's attackers, they could be able to take advantage of mistakes in a similar way that West Ham did.
West Ham will need to defeat Brighton on the final day and see Manchester United drop points at Crystal Palace to clinch the Europa League spot.

     Thrilling West Ham draw keeps title in City’s hands
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Such thoughts were a long way from City minds at half-time at the London Stadium, where West Ham capitalised on an uncharacteristically slow start from the league leaders.
City’s stirring fightbackIt felt like Guardiola’s men had a mountain to climb as Taylor’s whistle brought an end to the first half in East London.
For City a draw that keeps our title fortunes in our own hands, will feel like a well-earned and vital point.
"Very pleased to come back against West Ham like we did in this stadium.
WEST HAM: Fabianski, Coufal, Dawson, Zouma, Cresswell, Rice (C), Soucek, Bowen, Lanzini (Noble 77'), Fornals (Johnson 90+2'), Antonio (Yarmolenko 90+5').
