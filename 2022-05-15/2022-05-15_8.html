     Oilers blank Kings to prevail in decisive Game 7, advance to 2nd round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Captain Connor McDavid has seen his team through to the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
McDavid had a goal and an assist as the Edmonton Oilers advanced with a nerve-racking 2-0 Game 7 victory over the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday.
WATCH l McDavid's 2-point effort leads Oilers past Kings in Game 7:Connor McDavid leads Oilers to game 7 win over Kings Duration 3:24 Edmonton shuts down Los Angeles in game seven after goals from Cody Ceci and Connor McDavid, they defeat the Kings 2-0 advancing to the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
The loss represented the final game for Kings star forward Dustin Brown, who announced that this was his final season prior to the playoffs.
The Oilers will now advance to play the winner of the Calgary Flames/Dallas Stars series — which will be decided in a Game 7 of its own on Sunday.

     Takeaways from LA Kings’ 2-0 loss in Game 7 vs the Edmonton Oilers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The LA Kings season ended on Saturday night with a 2-0 loss to the Edmonton Oilers in Game 7, their first loss in a playoff series’ seventh game since losing to the Colorado Avalanche in 2002.
After that goal, you could feel the life sucked of the Kings squad, and you knew the inevitable was coming.
McDavid had one of the best players I’ve ever seen since becoming a hockey fan.
Late in the third period, when he outmuscled Sean Durzi and buried the puck, that goal solidified the win for Edmonton.
The Kings weren’t there for the experience.

     The Future is Bright for the Los Angeles Kings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Los Angeles Kings' hopes of making the second round were dashed on Saturday, but better days are ahead, and a little bit more patience in getting there should go a long way in seasons to come.
But in Los Angeles, the mood wasn’t quite so dim.
The Kings may not have been the Edmonton Oilers in Round One this year, but L.A. is a different animal at this stage in their competitive cycle.
The picture is a little different in the Kings’ net, where veteran Jonathan Quick finished out the season and playoffs as L.A.’s No.
For now, at least, there’s good fun to be had in being a Kings fan again.

     Summary: The LA Kings boarded a flight to Edmonton to prepare for Game 7 of the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
When you look at last night’s game, and the series as a whole, it’s okay to be disappointed.
Across the seven games, the Kings gave themselves an opportunity to come out on top.
It’s a disappointing ending, however, to anything but a disappointing season.
An 82-game schedule provided different opportunities, different challenges and different moments when it came to covering this team.

     L.A. Kings, Dustin Brown and a Game 7 loss: 12 thoughts as a season and career end
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This was his first playoff series since 2018 and he had two assists in the seven games.
Fittingly, Brown had the most hits in Game 7 among Kings forwards with five, tied with Carl Grundstrom.
In all, 11 Kings players made their NHL playoff debuts in the first round, including goaltender Cal Petersen, who came on in relief for Quick in Game 3.
There were also a few questions about Brown — just in case Game 7 ended up being his final game in the NHL.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After dropping Game 1 by a score of 10-1, the Ontario Reign managed to rally late and force overtime in Game 2.
Akil Thomas scores his 4th goal of the playoffs to bring the #Reign to within 1.
Entering Sunday night, the big questions surround what lineup Ontario will go with.
Given how Colorado has tried to push around Ontario, it was a bit surprising to not see 6-foot-6 Samuel Helenius in the lineup for Game 2.
Additionally, should there be a Game 4, the Kings could also assign three other prospects to Ontario.
