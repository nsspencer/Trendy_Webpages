     1 Dead and 4 Are Critically Injured in California Church Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A gunman who opened fire inside a Southern California church on Sunday, killing one person and critically wounding four others, was overpowered by congregants who then hogtied him, preventing further bloodshed, the authorities said.
Most of the victims were of Taiwanese descent, though officials were still investigating if they had been targeted, said Carrie Braun, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Sheriff’s Department.
A motive for the shooting was not immediately clear.
The person who was killed was found inside the church by the authorities, she said.
Further details on the conditions of those hospitalized were not immediately available; the Sheriff’s Department described them as four Asian men ranging in age from 66 to 92 and an 86-year-old Asian woman.

     Shooting at Geneva Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods Leaves 1 Dead, 4 Critcal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “They undoubtedly prevented additional injuries and fatalities,” Orange County Undersheriff Jeff Hallock said at a press conference following the attack at the Geneva Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods.
But while authorities have said the Buffalo rampage was carried out by a white supremacist gunning for Black people, the motive in the California church shooting was still unclear.
“This should not be our new normal.”According to the Laguna Woods city website, the majority of its residents live in retirement communities; Laguna Woods Village is the largest by far, with more than 18,000 residents across thousands of units.
Geneva Presbyterian Church has a stated mission of fostering “an inclusive congregation worshipping, learning, connecting, giving, and serving together,” its website says.
The Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church gathers at the sanctuary on Sunday mornings, according to a schedule published online.
