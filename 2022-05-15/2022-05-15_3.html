     Jason Momoa apologizes after taking photos in the Sistine Chapel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) "Aquaman" star Jason Momoa took to Instagram to apologize for taking photos in the Sistine Chapel -- by posting a sweaty, shirtless workout video.
Momoa, 42, is currently in Rome shooting "Fast X", the 10th installment in the "Fast &amp; Furious" film saga.
But disgruntled fans quickly pointed out in the comments that visitors are typically forbidden from taking photos or videos in the chapel, which is located in Vatican City.
On Saturday, Momoa posted another video in which he addressed the controversy -- after a brief moment of working out.
"It's my last day in Rome, and I just love you and Italy," he said after setting down the dumbbells.
