     1 Dead and 4 Are Critically Injured in California Church Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A gunman who opened fire inside a Southern California church on Sunday, killing one person and critically wounding four others, was overpowered by congregants who then hogtied him, preventing further bloodshed, the authorities said.
Most of the victims were of Taiwanese descent, though officials were still investigating if they had been targeted, said Carrie Braun, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Sheriff’s Department.
A motive for the shooting was not immediately clear.
The person who was killed was found inside the church by the authorities, she said.
Further details on the conditions of those hospitalized were not immediately available; the Sheriff’s Department described them as four Asian men ranging in age from 66 to 92 and an 86-year-old Asian woman.

     Summary: (CNN) At least one person is dead and five wounded -- including four who are critically injured -- after a shooting Sunday at a church in Laguna Woods, California, the sheriff's department said.
"All victims are adults and are en route to the hospital," the Orange County Sheriff's Department said in a tweet Sunday.
The shooting happened at the Geneva Presbyterian Church during a lunch reception to honor a former pastor of a Taiwanese congregation that uses the church for its worship services, according to Tom Cramer, a presbytery leader.

He is believed to be an Asian man in his 60s who doesn't live in the area, said Hallock.
