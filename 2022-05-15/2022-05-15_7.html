“The Kardashians” star and Blink-182 rocker tied the knot — for real this time — in Santa Barbara, Calif., Sunday, TMZ reported.
The classic-looking ceremony was a far cry from their sham wedding in Las Vegas following the Grammy Awards.
nataliechapino/TwitterKardashian later confirmed the Vegas nuptials weren’t legitimate, as the couple didn’t have a license to legally do the deed.
He popped the question at the Rosewood Miramar Beach in Santa Barbara — the same town as their wedding.

     Summary: Reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian legally married rock drummer Travis Barker on Sunday.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Gotham/Getty ImagesKourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker appear to have wed in Santa Barbara this weekend, according to TMZ.
Perhaps this is the real deal, or perhaps Kravis will continue having fake marriage after fake marriage à la Emmett and Rosalie in the Twilight saga (look it up, they elope like once a decade, those crazy kids).
Kourt and Travis were seen in a white dress and tux outside the Kourthouse.
Kourtney and Travis were friends for many years before getting together.
The pair have had a whirlwind romance that saw (1) many, many red-carpet PDA moments and (2) Barker overcoming his fear of flying.

     Summary: Kourtney Kardashian is a married woman -- she just tied the knot with Travis Barker ... and this time, they're truly man and wife in the eyes of the law.
TB was decked out in an all-black tuxedo, and Kourtney had on a white dress that was cut short at the knees.
Their getaway ride ... a sweet-looking black lowrider convertible, which had a sign strapped to the front grill that reads "JUST MARRIED."
So yeah, they're legit hitched this time.
We'd been told differing accounts about whether they were actually married at the time, but as it turns out -- they totally weren't.
