     Margot Robbie could lead the new 'Pirates of the Caribbean' film
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was adapted from a Disney theme park, and starred Johnny Depp.
A script was announced in June 2020 that was supposed to star Margot Robbie, although reports have been pencil thin recently, partially in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and partially due to the producer’s desire to write a completely different kind of script.
Invariably, he was asked about the Pirates of The Caribbean spin-off starring Margot Robbie.
We’re talking to Margot Robbie,” Bruckheimer replied.
In other Robbie related news, the actor will play the title role in Greta Gerwig’s upcoming live-action Barbie movie.
