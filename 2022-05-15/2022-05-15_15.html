     A Fringe Conspiracy Theory, Fostered Online, Is Refashioned by the G.O.P.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Inside a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, a white man with a history of antisemitic internet posts gunned down 11 worshipers, blaming Jews for allowing immigrant “invaders” into the United States.
The next year, another white man, angry over what he called “the Hispanic invasion of Texas,” opened fire on shoppers at an El Paso Walmart, leaving 23 people dead, and later telling the police he had sought to kill Mexicans.
And in yet another deadly mass shooting, unfolding in Buffalo on Saturday, a heavily armed white man is accused of killing 10 people after targeting a supermarket on the city’s predominantly Black east side, writing in a lengthy screed posted online that the shoppers there came from a culture that sought to “ethnically replace my own people.”Three shootings, three different targets — but all linked by one sprawling, ever-mutating belief now commonly known as replacement theory.
At the extremes of American life, replacement theory — the notion that Western elites, sometimes manipulated by Jews, want to “replace” and disempower white Americans — has become an engine of racist terror, helping inspire a wave of mass shootings in recent years and fueling the 2017 right-wing rally in Charlottesville, Va., that erupted in violence.

     The Buffalo Shooter’s Manifesto Relied on the Same White Supremacist Conspiracy Pushed by Tucker Carlson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The theory is popular among white supremacists and is predicated on the racist falsehood that white people are purposely being replaced by people of color.
“Zip code 14208 in Buffalo has the highest black percentage that is close enough to where I live,” a line from the manifesto reads.
Also reportedly referenced in the manifesto is the gunman who killed 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019.
Carlson is sure to receive fresh scrutiny in the wake of the Buffalo tragedy.
After all, embracing Carlson’s white supremacist views is now the bread and butter for the rest of the GOP.

     Trump and Tucker Carlson fuel white racism that led to Buffalo massacre

     Summary: WALLACE: White supremacists, white supremacists, and right-wing militia.
Instead of rejecting, Trump actively urged the white supremacists The Proud Boys to “stand by” for future instructions.
New York Times reporter Nicholas Confessore wrote a very lengthy expose of Carlson and his racist fear-mongering recently.
When asked by NPR which racist theory did Carlson focus on most, Confessore said “replacement theory”, noting Carlson had referred to it in no less than 400 of his shows.
Trump and Carlson are enabling and encouraging hate speech in America.

     Tucker Carlson claims domestic terrorism ‘doesn’t exist’ in resurfaced video following Buffalo shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Controversial Fox News host Tucker Carlson has once again sparked a wave of public condemnation online – this time over previous comments on domestic terrorism which have resurfaced following a shooting in Buffalo, New York on Saturday.
However, it is comments from Mr Biden warning of domestic terrorism which Carlson has targeted in the past, with a video from an episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight in January being reshared to social media on Saturday night.
“Where exactly is all this ‘criminal white supremacy’, this right-wing domestic terrorism that poses ‘the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland’?
Well, ‘cause it doesn’t exist,” Carlson said, in a clip posted by Twitter user Acyn.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The one where the killer posted a manifesto citing the "great replacement theory" as his motivation?
There was one reference, somewhere between 9:30 a.m. and 10 a.m. A shooting in Buffalo had occurred, Fox told its viewers, and people were dead.
It's a liberal plot, "to change the racial mix of the country," Carlson told viewers on Sept. 22, 2021.
The Great Replacement Theory has been hovering in the background of several ugly events in recent years, including the 2017 Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville ("Jews will not replace us!")
The Great Replacement Theory isn't new.

     Mass shooting in Buffalo: Tucker Carlson and other right-wing conspiracy theorists share the blame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The "great replacement" theory has been a favorite of Carlson's for some time now.
Carlson doesn't actually say "Jews," and generally blames the sinister plan on Democrats, socialists or unspecified "elites," but otherwise has kept the conspiracy theory intact.
This only encourage his viewers to embrace the conspiracy theory even more, telling themselves that they (and he) are bold truth-tellers fighting against the forces of liberal oppression.
After all, this is just the latest in a series of mass shootings inspired by the "great replacement" theory, including the Walmart shooting in El Paso that left 23 dead and the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh in which 11 people died.
Since those massacres, the "great replacement" theory has only become more popular with Republican voters, largely thanks to Carlson and similar figures on the right.

     Buffalo shooting: Anti-racism experts condemn ‘great replacement’ conspiracy pushed by Tucker Carlson and GOP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a manifesto verified by several news outlets as belonging to the shooting suspect, the 18-year-old clearly links his aims to reversing a trend that has been coined by white supremacist conspiracy theorists as the “white replacement theory”.
But experts on hate and disinformation agree that the rhetoric Carlson and other Republican-aligned figures have espoused is playing into such racist beliefs shifting closer to the mainstream.
Tucker is just capitalizing on it.”Many disagree on how to handle the rhetoric being increasingly spread by the far right.
Others, like the Anti-Defamation League, took the exact opposite response and are calling for Democrats to pass legislation aimed at battling white supremacist beliefs on the airwaves and online.
“This was yet another predictable attack by an avowed white supremacist who imbibed hateful conspiracy theories online and then turned to violent action, this time targeting mostly Black victims.
