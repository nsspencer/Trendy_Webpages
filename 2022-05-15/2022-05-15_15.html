    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I know it’s not everybody’s cup of tea, but for my money, one of my favorite things is when a position player takes the mound in a blowout.
The game has already become deeply un-fun for casuals and fans of the loser, and has even become only medium fun for fans of the winner.
So inject more fun, why don’t you?!
Tonight, the St. Louis Cardinals were blowing out the San Francisco Giants, and they turned to a position player to pitch.
pic.twitter.com/DM4aUkE4R1 — MLB (@MLB) May 16, 2022Sure, his ERA is now up to 36.00, but his 32.12 FIP suggests he has merely been unlucky.

     Summary: The average MLB fan may think there’s nothing left for Albert Pujols to do in terms of firsts.
He picked up his first career hit on April 2, 2001 – a single off Colorado Rockies pitcher Mike Hampton.
In the middle of the St. Louis Cardinals’ blowout against the Giants, Pujols made the trip to the bump for the first time in his 22-year career.
Lena Blackburne did it at 42 years and 225 days old in 1929 for the Chicago White Sox.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Albert Pujols has done just about everything you can on a baseball field—except pitch.
Example video title will go here for this videoST. LOUIS — St. Louis Cardinals legend Albert Pujols has done pretty much everything in his major league career.
Pujols took the mound in the ninth inning with the Cardinals leading 15-2 against the San Francisco Giants.
"He needs to keep (his) pitches down," Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina joked after the game.
Pujols got LaMonte Wade Jr. to ground out to Brendan Donovan to finish the inning, and the game.

     Albert Pujols makes first career appearance as pitcher while Yadier Molina, Adam Wainwright make history
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Adam Wainwright started on the mound with Yadier Molina behind the plate for the Cardinals, a combination that is now the most prolific in major-league history, from a certain point of view.
As for Albert Pujols, this marked the 2,988th career regular-season game for the future Hall of Famer.
In Sunday's blowout win by the Cardinals over the Giants, though, we saw Pujols on the mound for the first time.
Pujols, unlike Molina and Wainwright, took a detour away from St. Louis for a large portion of his career, but he's back in likely his swan song.
It all started Sunday night with Wainwright on the mound, Molina behind the plate and Pujols at DH.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants' game against the Cardinals in St. Louis on Sunday got out of hand early and by the end, there was position player-turned-pitcher hitting a homer off a future Hall of Fame slugger-turned-pitcher.
With the Cardinals in firm control of their eventual 15-6 win over the Giants, both teams used positions players on the mound late in the blowout.
The all-time great has hit 681 career homers and now has allowed two long balls.
The Giants didn't have much fun during Sunday's blowout loss, but some of the players did seem to enjoy watching Pujols pitch.
Hopefully for the Giants, they can carry the home run swagger into their three-game series against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field beginning on Monday night.

Pujols, who had two hits and reached base in his first five plate appearances as the DH, spoke up and volunteered to pitch.

Rodón, San Francisco’s starter, hadn’t allowed a first-pitch hit all year.
That was the first homer Rodón has allowed this season, ending a streak of 171 batters faced without one.
Boom, St. Louis had four quick runs off Rodón, who hadn’t allowed more than two in his first six starts of the season.
“It wasn’t very good,” said Rodón, who will take a look at the whole outing, including if he might have tipped any pitches.
