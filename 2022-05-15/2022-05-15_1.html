     Dallas Mavericks Stun the Phoenix Suns in Game 7 Upset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Phoenix, the loss ended a season that began ominously when the N.B.A.
started investigating Robert Sarver, the owner of the Suns and the W.N.B.A.’s Phoenix Mercury.
On the court, it was the Suns’ most promising season in 12 years.
The Suns set the franchise single-season wins record with their 63rd victory, which came against the Los Angeles Lakers in a game that knocked the Lakers out of playoff contention.
The Suns were led by two All-Star guards: the 25-year-old Devin Booker, and the 37-year-old Chris Paul, in his 17th N.B.A.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ja Morant sent out a tweet about the Phoenix Suns during Game 7 on Sunday night.
The Phoenix Suns are hosting the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday night in Arizona for Game 7 of their second-round playoff series.
Memphis Grizzlies All-Star Ja Morant sent out a tweet about the Suns during the game.
Morant's tweet said: "suns look shook"The series has been all over the place as no road team has won a game, and the home team has looked absolutely dominant in every game.
The Grizzlies lost their second-round series to the Golden State Warriors in Game 6, and the winner between the Suns and Mavs will face off with the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals.

     Suns offseason preview: Devin Booker's extension, Deandre Ayton's free agency and more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phoenix’s main goals this offseason are similar to last year’s where they mainly needed to re-sign or extend their players.
Ayton will be eligible to re-sign with the Suns for up to five years, $176.9 million.
That would give him a starting salary of $30.5 and would propel Phoenix into a luxury tax payment starting in the low $30 million range.
He is also eligible for up to four years, $131.2 million either through an offer sheet or sign-and-trade to another team.
If the Suns don’t offer it, it’s possible Ayton receives a maximum offer sheet for them to match.

     Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks author dominant Game 7 effort en route to eliminating Phoenix Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Mavericks get big games from Luka Doncic and Spencer Dinwiddie to crush the Suns in Game 7 and advance to the Western Conference Finals.
(3:03)PHOENIX - As Luka Doncic lit up the scoreboard in Sunday's Game 7, burying the top-seeded Phoenix Suns by halftime, the Dallas Mavericks' superstar broke out in laughter after some of his buckets.
Maybe a couple of games here we weren't ourselves, but we came here with a statement in Game 7.
Doncic seized control of the game seconds into the opening possession, swishing a turnaround jumper over Phoenix center Deandre Ayton, the player the Suns selected over Doncic with the No.
Doncic cited Dallas' dominant defensive performance, not his individual brilliance, as the primary reason he scored as many points in the first half as the Suns.
