     Dallas Mavericks Stun the Phoenix Suns in Game 7 Upset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Their entire team had scored 27 points — just as many as Doncic had during the first half.
“Some of the pressure was probably on them early because they missed some shots that they normally make,” Mavericks Coach Jason Kidd said.
For Phoenix, the loss ended a season that began ominously when the N.B.A.
started investigating Robert Sarver, the owner of the Suns and the W.N.B.A.’s Phoenix Mercury, after current and former employees accused him of racist, sexist and otherwise inappropriate behavior.
The Suns were led by two All-Star guards: the 25-year-old Booker, and the 37-year-old Paul, in his 17th N.B.A.

     Summary: Ja Morant sent out a tweet about the Phoenix Suns during Game 7 on Sunday night.
The Phoenix Suns are hosting the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday night in Arizona for Game 7 of their second-round playoff series.
Memphis Grizzlies All-Star Ja Morant sent out a tweet about the Suns during the game.
Morant's tweet said: "suns look shook"The series has been all over the place as no road team has won a game, and the home team has looked absolutely dominant in every game.
The Grizzlies lost their second-round series to the Golden State Warriors in Game 6, and the winner between the Suns and Mavs will face off with the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals.

     Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks author dominant Game 7 effort en route to eliminating Phoenix Suns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX -- The Western Conference finals will have a surprise participant after Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks dismissed the top-seeded Phoenix Suns from the NBA playoffs in completely dominant fashion.
The Mavericks claimed the right to advance to face the Golden State Warriors by rolling to a 123-90 rout of the Suns in Sunday's Game 7.
He sat out the entire fourth quarter, as the game was well in hand by that point.
Doncic seized control on the opening possession, when he swished a turnaround jumper that gave Dallas the lead for good.
Dallas sixth man Spencer Dinwiddie was almost as spectacular, scoring 21 of his playoff career-high 30 points in the first half.

     Suns offseason preview: Devin Booker's extension, Deandre Ayton's free agency and more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phoenix’s main goals this offseason are similar to last year’s where they mainly needed to re-sign or extend their players.
Ayton will be eligible to re-sign with the Suns for up to five years, $176.9 million.
That would give him a starting salary of $30.5 and would propel Phoenix into a luxury tax payment starting in the low $30 million range.
He is also eligible for up to four years, $131.2 million either through an offer sheet or sign-and-trade to another team.
If the Suns don’t offer it, it’s possible Ayton receives a maximum offer sheet for them to match.
