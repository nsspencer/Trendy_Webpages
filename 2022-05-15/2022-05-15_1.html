     Dallas Mavericks Stun the Phoenix Suns in Game 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Phoenix, the loss ended a season that began ominously when the N.B.A.
started investigating Robert Sarver, the owner of the Suns and the W.N.B.A.’s Phoenix Mercury.
On the court, it was the Suns’ most promising season in 12 years.
The Suns set the franchise single-season wins record with their 63rd victory, which came against the Los Angeles Lakers in a game that knocked the Lakers out of playoff contention.
The Suns were led by two All-Star guards: the 25-year-old Devin Booker, and the 37-year-old Chris Paul, in his 17th N.B.A.

     Mavericks, not Suns, looked like the team on the ‘revenge tour’ in Game 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX — More than two hours before tip-off of Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals, injured Dallas Mavericks wing Tim Hardaway Jr. noticed a little moisture on the court.
Throughout the series, the Mavericks relied heavily on Luka Doncic and throughout the series, the fourth-year Slovenian star delivered.
In Games 1 through 6, the Mavericks rained down threes on the Suns — many of them open looks.
Dallas connected on 19 deep balls — the fifth time they hit more than 15 in a game in this series.
For months, the Suns looked like their “revenge tour” mentality was real and it was championship or bust.

     Suns Suffer Humiliating Loss to Luka Doncic, Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At that point, Dallas held what was an insignificant 5–3 lead when Luka Dončić dribbled the ball up the middle of the floor across halfcourt.
Phoenix’s season—which before the playoffs had been the best in franchise history—ended in shocking, confusing, humiliating fashion on Sunday night.
By halftime, Luka had as many points as the entire Suns team combined.
It was a particularly ignominious loss for Paul, whose playoff career—fair or unfair—somehow continues to be defined by missed opportunities.
Instead of facing questions about how to build around Luka, the Mavs won a series nobody expected them to win.

     Mavericks storm past Suns to win Game 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fourth-seeded Mavericks travel to face Golden State in Game 1 on Wednesday.
The series might have been close but the individual games usually were not.
The 37-year-old Paul is a 12-time All-Star that has done just about everything possible in the game except win a championship.
Dallas beat the odds with the win: After the Celtics defeated the Bucks earlier Sunday, the home team was 110-33 (77%) in NBA Game 7s.
It’s the second straight year the Suns have lost a playoff series after having a 2-0 lead.
