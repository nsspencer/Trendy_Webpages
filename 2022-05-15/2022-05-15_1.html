     Dallas Mavericks Stun the Phoenix Suns in Game 7 Upset
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Phoenix, the loss ended a season that began ominously when the N.B.A.
started investigating Robert Sarver, the owner of the Suns and the W.N.B.A.’s Phoenix Mercury.
On the court, it was the Suns’ most promising season in 12 years.
The Suns set the franchise single-season wins record with their 63rd victory, which came against the Los Angeles Lakers in a game that knocked the Lakers out of playoff contention.
The Suns were led by two All-Star guards: the 25-year-old Devin Booker, and the 37-year-old Chris Paul, in his 17th N.B.A.

     Suns offseason preview: Devin Booker's extension, Deandre Ayton's free agency and more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phoenix’s main goals this offseason are similar to last year’s where they mainly needed to re-sign or extend their players.
Ayton will be eligible to re-sign with the Suns for up to five years, $176.9 million.
That would give him a starting salary of $30.5 and would propel Phoenix into a luxury tax payment starting in the low $30 million range.
He is also eligible for up to four years, $131.2 million either through an offer sheet or sign-and-trade to another team.
If the Suns don’t offer it, it’s possible Ayton receives a maximum offer sheet for them to match.

     Luka Doncic Leads Mavs Over Suns in Game 7 Blowout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX (AP) — Luka Doncic scored 35 points, Spencer Dinwiddie added 30 and the Dallas Mavericks stunned the top-seeded Phoenix Suns with a 123-90 Game 7 blowout Sunday night, advancing to the Western Conference finals for the first time since 2011.
Conversely, it was an embarrassing no-show for the playoff-tested Suns — who advanced to the NBA Finals last season with a very similar roster.
Dallas beat the odds with the win: After the Celtics defeated the Bucks earlier Sunday, the home team was 110-33 (77%) in NBA Game 7s.
They won the first two games against the Bucks in the NBA Finals last season before losing four straight games.
Suns: Phoenix shot just 6 of 23 (26.1%) from the field in the first quarter.

     Chris Paul says he's not retiring after Phoenix Suns' season ends in stunning blowout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX -- For the second straight year, Suns point guard Chris Paul's season came to an end with his team failing to protect a 2-0 series lead en route to a disappointing NBA playoffs exit.
He averaged 23.5 points and just two turnovers in the first two games -- including a masterful 14-point fourth quarter in Game 2 -- and Phoenix took a 2-0 lead.
"I think Mont said that's on him, but I think that's on me, as the point guard, the leader of the team.
Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said the enormity of the moment in the win-or-go-home game might have gotten to the Suns.
"We basically played our worst game of the season tonight," Williams said.
