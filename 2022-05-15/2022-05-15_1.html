     Dallas Mavericks Stun the Phoenix Suns in Game 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Phoenix, the loss ended a season that began ominously when the N.B.A.
started investigating Robert Sarver, the owner of the Suns and the W.N.B.A.’s Phoenix Mercury.
On the court, it was the Suns’ most promising season in 12 years.
The Suns set the franchise single-season wins record with their 63rd victory, which came against the Los Angeles Lakers in a game that knocked the Lakers out of playoff contention.
The Suns were led by two All-Star guards: the 25-year-old Devin Booker, and the 37-year-old Chris Paul, in his 17th N.B.A.

However, Dallas won Game 3 and Game 4 at home to even the series.
The Suns came back to blast the Mavericks by 30 in Game 5 in Phoenix, but Dallas returned the favor in Thursday's 113-86 home victory to force a decisive Game 7.

     Suns offseason preview: Devin Booker's extension, Deandre Ayton's free agency and more
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phoenix’s main goals this offseason are similar to last year’s where they mainly needed to re-sign or extend their players.
Ayton will be eligible to re-sign with the Suns for up to five years, $176.9 million.
That would give him a starting salary of $30.5 and would propel Phoenix into a luxury tax payment starting in the low $30 million range.
He is also eligible for up to four years, $131.2 million either through an offer sheet or sign-and-trade to another team.
If the Suns don’t offer it, it’s possible Ayton receives a maximum offer sheet for them to match.

     Summary: Gifted with the greatest stage in basketball, the Suns trailed by 30 points at halftime.
This is worse because these Suns set a franchise record for most regular season wins in history.
He attempted to minimize their failure, lamenting how the Suns just ran into a bad night at the worst possible time.
“From my standpoint, I did not have us ready to play in a Game 7,” Williams said.
Say we lose and move forward with it.”To a man, the Suns tried to paint the season as a success.

     Summary: PHOENIX -- For the second straight year, Suns point guard Chris Paul's season came to an end with his team failing to protect a 2-0 series lead en route to a disappointing NBA playoffs exit.
He averaged 23.5 points and just two turnovers in the first two games -- including a masterful 14-point fourth quarter in Game 2 -- and Phoenix took a 2-0 lead.
"I think Mont said that's on him, but I think that's on me, as the point guard, the leader of the team.
Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said the enormity of the moment in the win-or-go-home game might have gotten to the Suns.
"We basically played our worst game of the season tonight," Williams said.

     Summary: The fourth-seeded Mavericks travel to face Golden State in Game 1 on Wednesday.
The series might have been close but the individual games usually were not.
The 37-year-old Paul is a 12-time All-Star that has done just about everything possible in the game except win a championship.
Dallas beat the odds with the win: After the Celtics defeated the Bucks earlier Sunday, the home team was 110-33 (77%) in NBA Game 7s.
It’s the second straight year the Suns have lost a playoff series after having a 2-0 lead.
