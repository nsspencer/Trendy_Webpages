     SNL: Post Malone Performs With Fleet Foxes &amp; Roddy Ricch, Appears In Two Sketches
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Post Malone was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live this weekend, performing opposite host Selena Gomez.
He did the recently-released single “Cooped Up” with Roddy Ricch and debuted a new track called “Love/Hate Letter to Alcohol,” which is a collaboration with Fleet Foxes’ Robin Pecknold.
(Fleet Foxes performed on the show in 2009.)
Posty and Pecknold have been public fans and friends for a while now — Post Malone was almost on Fleet Foxes’ most recent album Shore.
Post Malone also appeared in two SNL sketches last night: a pre-taped rap segment called “Intuition” opposite Gomez, Chris Redd, and Punkie Johnson, and the final sketch of the night in which Post Malone plays a baby.

     ‘SNL’: Post Malone Brings Out Roddy Ricch, Fleet Foxes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Grammy-nominated rapper performed on Saturday Night Live as the musical guest in anticipation of his forthcoming album, Twelve Carat Toothache, which arrives June 3.
The first song Malone performed was the bruising new single, “Cooped Up.” Malone touchingly brought out his friend and collaborator Roddy Ricch, which felt like a victory since Ricch’s SNL performance that was scheduled for earlier in the season got bungled due to a COVID-19 exposure.
Malone ended the show with a passionate new song from Toothache called “Love/Hate Letter to Alcohol.” The stage was enveloped in smoke and Fleet Foxes.
The indie group stood in Gregorian-chant formation around Malone, who wore a school uniform a la Lydia Deetz from Beetlejuice and two silver bullet earrings dangling beside his mutton chops.
“Why’d you have to go and fuckin’ ruin my night?”If this performance is any indication of what’s to come for Post Malone, it seems the beerbongs and Bentleys have gone Biblical.
