     Summary: We haven't heard much about the spinoff at all, but it's heading towards the scripting stage.
A sixth installment in the main series was announced to be in development, alongside a spinoff being crafted by Birds of Prey duo Margot Robbie and Christina Hodson.
It’s been a while since we’ve heard a peep out of either, but producer Jerry Bruckheimer has confirmed to The Sunday Times that both projects continue to move forward.
We’re talking to Margot Robbie.
We are developing two Pirates scripts — one with her, one without.”When questioned about Depp, though, Bruckheimer takes a more vague stance by admitting “not at this point, the future is yet to be decided”.

     Jerry Bruckheimer Gets Asked If Johnny Depp Could Return For The Pirates Of The Caribbean Movie Not Starring Margot Robbie. Here’s What He Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of course, many are surely curious as to whether there’s a real possibility that Johnny Depp could return as Captain Jack Sparrow in a future movie.
Now, producer Jerry Bruckheimer has spoken on that matter.
Fans had mixed thoughts on the possibility of Margot Robbie leading a Pirates movie.
While some seemed to be in favor of it, others declared that the series couldn’t move forward without Johnny Depp in the lead role.
While Jerry Bruckheimer didn’t shoot down the possibility entirely, it sounds like it’s far from a sure thing.

     Summary: Pirates of the Caribbean is far from dead.
Margot Robbie has gone a lot way since breaking out in 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street.
According to Bruckheimer, they are still "talking to Margot Robbie" and that they are working on "two Pirates scripts - one with her, one without."
There've been a lot of rumors about a new Pirates of the Caribbean film after 2017's Dead Men Tell No Tales.
Disney's decision on the future of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise might depend on how the highly-publicized defamation trial will turn out.
