    </h2>

     Summary: The average MLB fan may think there’s nothing left for Albert Pujols to do in terms of firsts.
He picked up his first career hit on April 2, 2001 – a single off Colorado Rockies pitcher Mike Hampton.
In the middle of the St. Louis Cardinals’ blowout against the Giants, Pujols made the trip to the bump for the first time in his 22-year career.
Lena Blackburne did it at 42 years and 225 days old in 1929 for the Chicago White Sox.

     Albert Pujols amazingly pitches, gives up two Giants homers in Cardinals' win
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Giants' game against the Cardinals in St. Louis on Sunday got out of hand early and by the end, there was position player-turned-pitcher hitting a homer off a future Hall of Fame slugger-turned-pitcher.
With the Cardinals in firm control of their eventual 15-6 win over the Giants, both teams used positions players on the mound late in the blowout.
The all-time great has hit 681 career homers and now has allowed two long balls.
The Giants didn't have much fun during Sunday's blowout loss, but some of the players did seem to enjoy watching Pujols pitch.
Hopefully for the Giants, they can carry the home run swagger into their three-game series against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field beginning on Monday night.

     Summary: And by the end of the Cardinals’ 15-6 win, Albert Pujols, a projected first-ballot Hall of Famer, was pitching.
Rodón, San Francisco’s starter, hadn’t allowed a first-pitch hit all year.
That was the first homer Rodón has allowed this season, ending a streak of 171 batters faced without one.
Boom, St. Louis had four quick runs off Rodón, who hadn’t allowed more than two in his first six starts of the season.
“It wasn’t very good,” said Rodón, who will take a look at the whole outing, including if he might have tipped any pitches.

Left-hander Carlos Rodón was tagged for a career-high-matching eight runs over 3 2/3 innings against the Cardinals’ aggressive lineup, causing his ERA to jump from 1.80 to 3.49.
It was the first blast allowed by Rodón this season, snapping a 43-inning homerless streak that dated to Sept. 20, 2021.
It was Pederson’s seventh homer of the year and his first since missing three games with a mild groin strain last month.
“I was telling Joey, ‘I’m going to be throwing some gas up there, you be better be ready.’”What was cooler, pitching in a game or homering off Pujols?
