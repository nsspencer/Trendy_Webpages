     Conversations With Friends review – TV so slow it must be trolling us
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is a moment a few episodes into Conversations With Friends (BBC Three), the adaptation of Sally Rooney’s debut novel, when it seems as if the makers are deliberately trolling viewers.
He’s starring in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof – “It’s a proper play,” he says, “where stuff happens.” Conversations With Friends is almost aggressively the opposite.
Now Birch, writing alone this time, and Abrahamson (directing seven episodes, and Leanne Welham the other five) have reunited.
Cool, confident Bobbi (Sasha Lane) and Frances (newcomer Alison Oliver), whose attempts at cynical poses only highlight her naivety, are best friends who dated at school and have just graduated.
When Frances balks at Bobbi telling her she has a shiny face, Bobbi hastens to reassure her.

     Conversations with Friends review: A tedious romantic drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, several years later, Hulu and the BBC have reteamed with several of the creative minds behind Normal People for Conversations with Friends.
Unfortunately, Conversations with Friends ultimately fails to recapture the magic of Hulu’s previous Rooney adaptation.
Despite featuring four potential lead characters, Conversations with Friends is primarily concerned with exploring Frances and Nick’s passionate romance.
In the end, his blandness leads to his and Frances’ affair losing its romantic tension somewhere around Conversations with Friends‘ midpoint.
For devoted fans of Rooney’s work, those brief flashes of greatness may be enough to make Conversations with Friends feel like a worthwhile investment of their time.

     Joe Alwyn on creating a 'modern love story' in Conversations With Friends
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And when Conversations With Friends came around, it was just one of those lovely special jobs where you get to work with the writer you love and the filmmaker [Lenny Abrahamson] you love.
And so what can seem quite distant or what can seem withholding, I think is really, he's just holding on, he's quite fragile.
Conversations with Friends Nick (Joe Alwyn) Joe Alwyn on 'Conversations with Friends' | Credit: Enda Bowe/HuluI also like that he could've been this super charismatic, over-the-top charming Hollywood actor, and instead, he's just a guy going through some stuff.
So when you got the role, did you sit down with Sally and really talk about who this guy is?
So I guess it's a modern coming-of-age love story about, can you love more than one person?

     Conversations With Friends Series-Premiere Recap: Just Being Polite
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Conversations with Friends Episode 1 Season 1 Episode 1 Editor’s Rating 3 stars * * * Previous Next » « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Enda Bowe/HULUSally Rooney published her first novel, Conversations With Friends, back in 2017.
So far, I feel like the show isn’t totally selling us on why exactly these two are still friends post-breakup, given the way Bobbi treats Frances.
Bobbi and Frances have the easy intimacy of people who are used to falling asleep on each other’s couches and in each other’s arms.
Nick gets Frances’s email so he can send her a ticket and, more importantly, so their emotionally inappropriate pen-pal relationship can commence.
I assume this is a sort of save-the-cat situation to endear us to Bobbi, but the episode has not really set us up to think she’s a very good friend, no?
