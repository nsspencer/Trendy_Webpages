     West Ham v Manchester City LIVE reaction: Jarrod Bowen brace slows Citizens' title charge, OG from Vladimir Coufal and Jack Grealish strike salvages draw for visitors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City missed the chance to move six points clear of Liverpool after a 2-2 draw at the London Stadium with West Ham.
Pep Guardiola’s side were 2-0 down at half time thanks to a brace from Jarrod Bowen, but they responded quickly in the second half through Jack Grealish.
Vladimir Coufal then diverted a Riyad Mahrez free-kick into his own net to bring the tie level.
In the dying moments, Mahrez had the chance to be the hero, but he missed a late penalty.
This was a game that had everything and the Irons pushed City all the way.

     Confirmed Line-Ups: West Ham vs Manchester City (Premier League)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City face West Ham at the London Stadium on Sunday afternoon in their final away fixture of the Premier League campaign.
The Premier League champions can take a crucial step towards retaining their crown when they face David Moyes' West Ham in east London this weekend after cruising to a 5-1 victory over Wolves at the Molineux in midweek.
Having been knocked out from each of the FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Champions League this season, Pep Guardiola's men can finish the season on a high should they manage to clinch a fourth Premier League title in five seasons.
With Liverpool travelling to St. Mary's on Tuesday next week, City can establish a six-point advantage over the Reds before their next league outing against Southampton.
Fernandinho and Aymeric Laporte are both starting against David Moyes' men despite fears over their respective fitness ahead of the tie.

     West Ham vs. Man City score: Guardiola's men rally for a point but see win slip away on Mahrez's missed PK
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City clawed their way back to earn a 2-2 draw at West Ham on Sunday, giving themselves a title boost just after it looked like it could slip away.
City trailed 2-0 at the break and rallied in the second half to take home a point, but Riyad Mahrez's late penalty miss means the title winner may not be decided till next Sunday.
City will feel like it was an opportunity missed, however, as Mahrez had a chance to get a winner late from the spot.
West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski read it the whole way, saving the penalty from Mahrez to see the points shared.
But for West Ham, this is a result that could see them secure a Europa League spot on the final day as they trail Manchester United by only two points.
