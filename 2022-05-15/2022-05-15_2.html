     6 people shot at church in Laguna Woods, California
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A man has opened fire at a church in Laguna Woods, California, killing at least one person and injuring five others, local officials and witnesses say.
The incident began at 1:26 p.m. on Sunday when officers were called for an active shooter at the Geneva Presbyterian Church on Toro Road in Laguna Woods, about 42 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
The Orange County Sheriff’s Office said one person was pronounced dead at the scene while five others were taken to area hospitals.
“We have detained one person and have recovered a weapon that may be involved,” a sheriff’s office spokesperson said.
The shooting comes just a day after a self-described white supremacist opened fire at a supermarket in upstate New York, killing 10 people and injuring 3 others.
