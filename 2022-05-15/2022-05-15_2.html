     West Ham v Manchester City LIVE reaction: Jarrod Bowen brace slows Citizens' title charge, OG from Vladimir Coufal and Jack Grealish strike salvages draw for visitors
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester City missed the chance to move six points clear of Liverpool after a 2-2 draw at the London Stadium with West Ham.
Pep Guardiola’s side were 2-0 down at half time thanks to a brace from Jarrod Bowen, but they responded quickly in the second half through Jack Grealish.
Vladimir Coufal then diverted a Riyad Mahrez free-kick into his own net to bring the tie level.
In the dying moments, Mahrez had the chance to be the hero, but he missed a late penalty.
This was a game that had everything and the Irons pushed City all the way.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hello and welcome to the Manchester Evening News' live coverage of Manchester City's trip to West Ham United in the Premier League this afternoon, kick-off 2:00pm.
Following Wednesday evening's thumping 5-1 win over Wolves at Molineux, City will be aiming to take another giant stride towards retaining their Premier League crown this afternoon.
Jurgen Klopp's men, who won the FA Cup on Saturday evening, still have two games left to play, meaning a win for City this afternoon will not wrap up the title.
Manager Pep Guardiola could have some difficult decisions to make as far as his starting line-up is concerned, particularly in defence.

     West Ham vs. Man City score: Guardiola's men rally for a point but see win slip away on Mahrez's missed PK
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski read it the whole way, saving the penalty from Mahrez to see the points shared.
Along with Laporte, he was caught out of position multiple times while allowing West Ham to get off shots en route to their two goals.
A slightly better defensive performance and City wouldn't have to sweat on the final day.
Guardiola doesn't have many choices but with Aston Villa's attackers, they could be able to take advantage of mistakes in a similar way that West Ham did.
West Ham will need to defeat Brighton on the final day and see Manchester United drop points at Crystal Palace to clinch the Europa League spot.
