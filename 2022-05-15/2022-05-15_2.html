     Grant Williams leads Boston Celtics past Milwaukee Bucks in convincing Game 7 victory in NBA playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Grant Williams drains seven 3-pointers as the Celtics advance past the Milwaukee Bucks to the Eastern Conference finals.
Williams' previous career high for 3-point attempts in a game was nine -- which he set in Game 2 of this series.
But against the Bucks, Williams had struggled since his Game 2 performance, going just 2-of-14 from deep in his past four games.
For the series, Boston made 110 3-pointers -- third most in a playoff series all time -- to just 57 for Milwaukee.
Before he went on to praise Williams, Tatum had a message for the third-year forward from Tennessee.

Williams listened, and shot his way into Boston folklore as he led the Celtics to a dominant 109-81 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, and into the Eastern Conference finals.
Lopez camped out in the paint to prevent the Celtics from getting anything easy at the rim, and dared Williams to win Game 7.
Brown came off the bench to make some huge shots down the stretch of the Celtics' Game 7 win of the 2008 Eastern Conference semifinals, en route to a ring.
Grant won us a playoff game tonight, a Game 7.

Seven games is the most the Celtics and Bucks could play, but no one would have griped if they went seven more.
So we said, ‘Why not now?’"Williams had never attempted more than nine three-pointers in a game before Game 7.
In the first round, the Celtics’ defense held Kevin Durant under 40% shooting.
“Miami is a really tough team,” Brown said.

     Summary: And the C’s relied on nearly every corner of their roster in the form of their role players.
Those role players are why Boston coach Ime Udoka said it “makes us harder to guard.”“A role player can flip a series,” Udoka said.
Then the role players — whoever it happens to be on a given game — can slide in to make the Celtics that much more dangerous in the postseason.
The Heat’s best players, guys like Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, thrive on physicality.
And that’s another opportunity for the role players to thrive based on their matchups.

Grant Williams of the Boston Celtics reacts after making a 3-point basket during the third quarter against the Milwaukee Bucks.
Photo by Adam Glanzman/Getty ImagesAfter the Celtics beat the Bucks in a dominant 109-81 Game 7 victory on Sunday, Jayson Tatum was asked about Grant Williams — the Celtics’ enthusiastic forward who fired up a new NBA record 18 3-pointers in the win.
The Celtics — who almost universally seem to treat Williams as an annoying but deeply lovable younger brother — told him to keep shooting.
They gambled that letting the Celtics shoot their way out of games would work four times in seven attempts.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We have a rematch of the 2020 conference finals, a series that was played in Orlando’s COVID-19 “bubble” and won by the Miami Heat.
The Heat don’t have the storied history of the Celtics, but they’re in the conference finals for the ninth time in the franchise’s 34 seasons.
That was the biggest such differential in a playoff series in NBA history.
The Celtics’ 110 3-pointers were tied for third-most in any playoff series.
But they’ve made one fewer 3 than their opponents over their 11 playoff games.
