     Billboard Music Awards 2022: Some of the night's big moments
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 Billboard Music Awards were held in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, and some of the biggest names in music were in the building to celebrate the year’s chart-toppers.
The ceremony was hosted by Diddy, and ahead of the event, he said one of his goals of the evening was to “uncancel the canceled”—which meant inviting Travis Scott and Morgan Wallen to take the stage.
The BBMAs marked Scott’s first televised performance since the Astroworld tragedy, and Wallen, of course, caught rightful scrutiny and backlash for using the N-word on camera early last year.
If you didn’t get a chance to tune into the BBMAs, we can’t say we blame you—but you’re in luck because The A.V.
Club has compiled a handy list of some of the night’s biggest moments.
