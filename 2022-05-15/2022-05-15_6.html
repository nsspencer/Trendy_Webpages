     Fetterman Recovering After Stroke Before His Senate Primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “They’re keeping me here for now for observation, but I should be out of here sometime soon,” he added.
Asked why the campaign waited days to share the news that a major Senate candidate had been hospitalized with a stroke, a matter of intense public interest, Mr. Calvello replied, “John’s condition was evolving in real time since Friday.
We wanted to put out something once we had a clearer picture of his health.”In the statement and in a brief accompanying video, Mr. Fetterman said he had been feeling unwell and that his wife, Gisele Barreto Fetterman, had insisted he go to the hospital to get checked out.
The development upended his ability to engage voters in-person during the most intense stretch of the race.
Still, he has been leading his most prominent Democratic rival, Representative Conor Lamb, by double digits in sparse public polling.

     Pennsylvania US Senate candidate Fetterman suffers stroke but says he's 'well on my way to a full recovery'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) John Fetterman, the favorite to win Pennsylvania's Democratic US Senate contest, announced Sunday that he's recovering after a stroke.
Fetterman is at the Penn Medicine Lancaster General Hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, according to a statement, which noted he first went to the hospital Friday.
Pennsylvania's primary is on Tuesday, and polls show Fetterman, Pennsylvania lieutenant governor, holding a significant lead over US Rep. Conor Lamb and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta.
Fetterman, who began canceling events on Friday, said Sunday he is continuing in the race.
He continued: "Our campaign isn't slowing down one bit, and we are still on track to win this primary on Tuesday, and flip this Senate seat in November."

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: John Fetterman, the leading Democrat in the state’s high-profile Senate contest, suffered a stroke just days before the primary election but was on his way to a “full recovery,” his campaign said on Sunday.
The 52-year-old Fetterman, who confirmed that he had been hospitalized all weekend, insisted the health emergency wasn’t slowing his campaign.
But the stunning revelation, two days before Pennsylvania’s primary, created a cloud of uncertainty over the Democratic front-runner’s candidacy in what may be one of the party’s best Senate pickup opportunities.
“I had a stroke that was caused by a clot from my heart being in an A-fib rhythm for too long,” Fetterman said.
Kenyatta called Fetterman “an incredible family man.” “My prayers are with him and his family as he recovers from this stroke,” he tweeted.

Fetterman, who is 52, stressed that he was feeling better, was expected to make a “full recovery,” and would be able to resume campaigning soon.
