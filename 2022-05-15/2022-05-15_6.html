     Summary: Tottenham Hotspur hosted relegation-threatened Burnley on Sunday morning, three days after a huge North London Derby win, in a must-win match if they wanted to keep the pressure on Arsenal for top four.
Extremely not a fun match to watch, but a win is a win is a win.
If the player doesn’t deserve a rating due to minutes played, DO NOT RANK.
I will round the stars up/down to the nearest half-star for the player ratings later this week.

     Tottenham vs Burnley: Kane penalty helps Spurs move into fourth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Harry Kane’s first-half penalty was enough for Tottenham Hotspur to beat Burnley 1-0 and move back into the top four to continue their push for Champions League qualification.
Spurs started strongly with Son Heung-min forcing a fine save from Nick Pope, before Nathan Collins cleared Kane’s effort off the line.
Spurs pressed for a second, but found Pope in inspired form as he made two stunning stops to deny Son.
A third win in four takes Spurs above Arsenal to fourth position on 68 points, two points ahead of their rivals having played a match more.
Burnley are 18th on 34 points, a point and a place behind Leeds United, over whom they have a match in hand.

     Summary: A contested Harry Kane penalty gave Tottenham Hotspur a 1-0 Premier League win over relegation-threatened Burnley on Sunday, moving Antonio Conte's team into a Champions League qualification place.
"Burnley were the perfect team to test our nerves," Conte said.
"I'm not sure that if we face this game three months ago we can celebrate three points at the end of the game.
But Spurs were forced to defend deep in the closing stages as Burnley pumped crosses into the area in the hope of a late equaliser.
Burnley travel to Aston Villa on Thursday before hosting Newcastle United at Turf Moor.

     Tottenham vs Burnley: Player ratings and analysis as Spurs keep pressure on Arsenal after Kane penalty
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley (Kane pen 45+5′)TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM — Whatever risk there was that Tottenham Hotspur would blow their newly acquired momentum in the race to qualify for the Champions League took until the very end of a nervous, tetchy win against Burnley to fully dissipate.
For the first 15 minutes, Burnley could not get out of their half.
It took Burnley 23 minutes to get a spell of possession in Tottenham’s half, and when they did they threatened.
A protracted VAR check yielded a penalty which Kane duly dispatched past Pope in the eighth minute of stoppage time.
That is good and he came off the bench and I hope he is ready to come in.”In positive news for Spurs, Kulusevski was healthy enough to be introduced as a 78th-minute substitute for the ineffectual Lucas Moura.
