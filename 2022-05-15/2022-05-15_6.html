     Fetterman Recovering After Stroke Before His Senate Primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “They’re keeping me here for now for observation, but I should be out of here sometime soon,” he added.
Asked why the campaign waited days to share the news that a major Senate candidate had been hospitalized with a stroke, a matter of intense public interest, Mr. Calvello replied, “John’s condition was evolving in real time since Friday.
We wanted to put out something once we had a clearer picture of his health.”In the statement and in a brief accompanying video, Mr. Fetterman said he had been feeling unwell and that his wife, Gisele Barreto Fetterman, had insisted he go to the hospital to get checked out.
The development upended his ability to engage voters in-person during the most intense stretch of the race.
Still, he has been leading his most prominent Democratic rival, Representative Conor Lamb, by double digits in sparse public polling.

     Summary: John Fetterman, the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania and frontrunner in the state’s Democratic US Senate primary, suffered a stroke Friday, and is recovering, he said in a statement.
“On Friday, I wasn’t feeling well, so I went to the hospital to get checked out.
I had a stroke that was caused by a clot from my heart being in an A-fib rhythm for too long,” the statement continued.
“The good news is I’m feeling much better, and the doctors tell me I didn’t suffer any cognitive damage.
I’m well on my way to a full recovery,” Fetterman said.

     Pennsylvania US Senate candidate Fetterman suffers stroke but says he's 'well on my way to a full recovery'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) John Fetterman, the favorite to win Pennsylvania's Democratic US Senate contest, announced Sunday that he's recovering after a stroke.
Fetterman is at the Penn Medicine Lancaster General Hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, according to a statement, which noted he first went to the hospital Friday.
Pennsylvania's primary is on Tuesday, and polls show Fetterman, Pennsylvania lieutenant governor, holding a significant lead over US Rep. Conor Lamb and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta.
Fetterman, who began canceling events on Friday, said Sunday he is continuing in the race.
He continued: "Our campaign isn't slowing down one bit, and we are still on track to win this primary on Tuesday, and flip this Senate seat in November."

     Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor and Democratic Candidate for U.S. Senate John Fetterman Suffers Stroke – NBC10 Philadelphia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor and Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate John Fetterman is recovering after suffering a stroke, he announced Sunday.
In a statement, the 52-year-old Fetterman said he was hospitalized on Friday due to not feeling well.
Fetterman has positioned himself as the choice for liberal voters in a four-way race in this week’s Democratic primary in Pennsylvania.
A poll from Monmouth University last month showed he had the “very likely” support of 44% of Democratic voters and he was leading his fellow Democratic candidates.
Despite such support, Lamb struggled to reach voters or even pierce Fetterman’s standing with primary voters.

     Summary: John Fetterman, U.S. Democratic Senate candidate for Pennsylvania, poses for a portrait at a meet-and-greet at the Weyerbacher Brewing Company in Easton, Pennsylvania, U.S., May 1, 2022.
John Fetterman, the leading Democrat in the state's high-profile Senate contest, suffered a stroke just days before the primary election but was on his way to a "full recovery," his campaign said on Sunday.
The 52-year-old Fetterman, who confirmed that he had been hospitalized all weekend, insisted the health emergency wasn't slowing his campaign.
"I had a stroke that was caused by a clot from my heart being in an A-fib rhythm for too long," Fetterman said.
He said the doctors were able to remove the clot, "reversing the stroke," and got his heart under control.

Fetterman, who is 52, stressed that he was feeling better, was expected to make a “full recovery,” and would be able to resume campaigning soon.
I didn’t want to go – I didn’t think I had to – but @giselefetterman insisted, and as usual, she was right.
The good news is I’m feeling much better + I’m well on my way to a full recovery.
