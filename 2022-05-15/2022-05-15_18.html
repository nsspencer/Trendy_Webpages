     K.H. Lee repeats at the AT&amp;T Byron Nelson, but there were several winners ahead of the PGA Championship
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Seldom is a guy who finished three back worthy of a shout out, but the Olympic gold medal winner gets one here, because he was flat-out ridiculous over his final 54 holes.
Actually, just look at his final 49 that he played in 26 under par and without a bogey.
He stood three over after three holes of his second round but somehow made the cut on the number at five under par.
He began the final round T-30 and putted out on 18 for birdie and a one-stroke lead he knew wasn’t going to hold up.
Still, he signed for 61.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Lee ran across the fairway to try to get a better view of the key shot in his second consecutive victory in the Byron Nelson.
Spieth shot a 67 to finish a stroke ahead of Matsuyama (62) and Sebastián Muñoz (69), who held or shared the lead the first three rounds.
Lee’s career-best round overcame a four-shot deficit going into the final round and put him at 26 under, one shot better than last year.
This final round was really close.
6 on in the second round to rally from 3 over and make the cut on the number (5 under).

     K.H. Lee closes with a 63, edges local favorite Jordan Spieth to repeat at AT&amp;T Byron Nelson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: McKINNEY, Texas – On the 17th green, staring over a 12-foot par putt to maintain a one-stroke lead at the AT&amp;T Byron Nelson, K.H.
He drained a 15-foot birdie putt at No.
He did well to chip it past the hole, praying before making his clutch left-to-right twisting par putt to protect a 1-shot edge.
No less than Jordan Spieth called Lee’s putting stroke “pure.”“That’s some high praise coming from Jordan,” observed CBS’s Colt Knost.
But this was Lee’s day for the second straight year, and he celebrated just off the 18th green with his parents, wife Joo Yeon and 10-month old Celene.

     2022 AT&amp;T Byron Nelson leaderboard, grades: K.H. Lee repeats after holding off challenge from Jordan Spieth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As of Sunday, they're the only golfers in history to win the AT&amp;T Byron Nelson multiple years in a row.
It took a 63 from Lee on Sunday – the lowest round of his career – to ward off Jordan Spieth (2nd), Hideki Matsuyama (T3), Justin Thomas (T5) and Xander Schauffele (T5).
Incredibly, it wasn't the best round of the day Sunday at the Nelson, nor was it the best round of those players listed.
Spieth and Lee both birdied that 72nd, and Lee disappointed a gallery hoping to Spieth win his hometown tournament for the first time and Spieth licking his wounds before he goes for the career grand slam next week at the PGA Championship.
Xander Schauffele (-23): When Schauffele ended his final round, he was the solo leader and 100-1 to win the tournament.
