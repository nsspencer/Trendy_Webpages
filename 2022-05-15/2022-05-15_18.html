     Doctor Who: David Tennant and Catherine Tate Returning in 2023
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: David Tennant and Catherine Tate are set to film scenes that will air in 2023 as part of the show’s 60th anniversary celebration, the BBC has announced.
And it looks impossible — first, we announce a new Doctor, and then an old Doctor along with the wonderful Donna.
Tennant previously reprised the role in 2013 as part of the show’s 50th anniversary, teaming up with then-Doctor Matt Smith.
Just one week ago, the series announced that Sex Education‘s Ncuti Gatwa will be stepping in as the series’ fourteenth Doctor starting with Season 14.
“Ncuti dazzled us, seized hold of the Doctor and owned those TARDIS keys in seconds.”As for Tennant and Tate’s return, what do you think will bring the Doctor and Donna back together?

Comedic actor Tate, 52, starred as his companion Donna Noble.
The Doctor and Donna parted ways when the Time Lord had to wipe her memory in order to save her life.

     David Tennant And Catherine Tate To Return To ‘Doctor Who’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: David Tennant and Catherine Tate are to return to next season’s Doctor Who, as anticipation grows for Russell T Davies’ retaking of the reins.
News of the pair’s return comes a week after Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa was confirmed as the 14th Time Lord in the long-running BBC series, which is seeing Davies return as showrunner after a 12-year absence.
Harry Potter and Des star Tennant played the 10th Doctor during Davies’ first Doctor Who showrunning gig from 2005 to 2010, while comedian Tate, who wrote and starred in Netflix series Hard Cell, played his companion Donna Noble.
Davies said: “It looks impossible – first, we announce a new Doctor, and then an old Doctor, along with the wonderful Donna, what on earth is happening?
The only thing I can confirm is that it’s going to be spectacular, as two of our greatest stars reunite for the battle of a lifetime.”
