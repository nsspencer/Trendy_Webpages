     The Buffalo Shooter’s Manifesto Relied on the Same White Supremacist Conspiracy Pushed by Tucker Carlson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The theory is popular among white supremacists and is predicated on the racist falsehood that white people are purposely being replaced by people of color.
“Zip code 14208 in Buffalo has the highest black percentage that is close enough to where I live,” a line from the manifesto reads.
Also reportedly referenced in the manifesto is the gunman who killed 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019.
Carlson is sure to receive fresh scrutiny in the wake of the Buffalo tragedy.
After all, embracing Carlson’s white supremacist views is now the bread and butter for the rest of the GOP.

     Tucker Carlson claims domestic terrorism ‘doesn’t exist’ in resurfaced video following Buffalo shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Controversial Fox News host Tucker Carlson has once again sparked a wave of public condemnation online – this time over previous comments on domestic terrorism which have resurfaced following a shooting in Buffalo, New York on Saturday.
However, it is comments from Mr Biden warning of domestic terrorism which Carlson has targeted in the past, with a video from an episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight in January being reshared to social media on Saturday night.
“Where exactly is all this ‘criminal white supremacy’, this right-wing domestic terrorism that poses ‘the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland’?
Well, ‘cause it doesn’t exist,” Carlson said, in a clip posted by Twitter user Acyn.

     Summary: Gendron, who is White, allegedly indicated that he chose a neighborhood with a large number of Black residents for his alleged attack.
There’s no indication that he watched Carlson’s program.
It has gained broader circulation in recent years as a talking point among prominent conservative media figures.
Oh, you know, the white replacement theory?

     Summary: WALLACE: White supremacists, white supremacists, and right-wing militia.
Instead of rejecting, Trump actively urged the white supremacists The Proud Boys to “stand by” for future instructions.
New York Times reporter Nicholas Confessore wrote a very lengthy expose of Carlson and his racist fear-mongering recently.
When asked by NPR which racist theory did Carlson focus on most, Confessore said “replacement theory”, noting Carlson had referred to it in no less than 400 of his shows.
Trump and Carlson are enabling and encouraging hate speech in America.

     Mass shooting in Buffalo: Tucker Carlson and other right-wing conspiracy theorists share the blame
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The "great replacement" theory has been a favorite of Carlson's for some time now.
Carlson doesn't actually say "Jews," and generally blames the sinister plan on Democrats, socialists or unspecified "elites," but otherwise has kept the conspiracy theory intact.
This only encourage his viewers to embrace the conspiracy theory even more, telling themselves that they (and he) are bold truth-tellers fighting against the forces of liberal oppression.
After all, this is just the latest in a series of mass shootings inspired by the "great replacement" theory, including the Walmart shooting in El Paso that left 23 dead and the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh in which 11 people died.
Since those massacres, the "great replacement" theory has only become more popular with Republican voters, largely thanks to Carlson and similar figures on the right.

     Buffalo Suspect Embraced Racist 'Replacement' Conspiracy Pushed By Tucker Carlson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bystanders gather under an umbrella as rain rolls in after a mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, Saturday.
Almost all of the victims in the mass shooting were Black.
In September, Media Matters reported that Carlson launched a “dedicated campaign to insert the ‘great replacement’ conspiracy theory … into mainstream Republican discourse.”The conspiracy motivated white nationalists who marched in 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia (who were described as “very fine people” by then-President Donald Trump).
Advertisement“It is the most mass-violence-inspiring idea in white supremacist circles right now,” Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, told the Times.
“A racially motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation,” Biden said in a statement Saturday after the shooting.

     Summary: Gendron was motivated by a classic version of White Replacement Theory, the view that a cabal of global elites is trying to destroy white nations, via the systematic replacement of white populations.
In Christchurch, New Zealand, Tarrant massacred 51 people at a Mosque in the name of White Replacement Theory, also live-streaming his actions.

The fact that Carlson does not mention American Jews as a target by name should be cold comfort to American Jews.
Any supporter of White Replacement Theory is a clear enemy of the Jewish People.
