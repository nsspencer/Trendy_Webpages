     ‘£50m player’: Conte tipped to completely transform Tottenham 21-year-old
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jermaine Jenas has told BBC Sport that Tottenham Hotspur head coach Antonio Conte could transform Ryan Sessegnon into a £50 million player.
The former Tottenham midfielder has been impressed by how Sessegnon has done under Conte at Spurs this season.
The 21-year-old can operate as a left-back or as a left-winger, but under Conte, he has been playing as a left wing-back.
Conte is a world-class manager, and under the Tottenham boss, Sessegnon would learn a lot more about the game.

     Dejan Kulusevski One Of Four Tottenham Players Hit By Viral "Stomach Problem"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dejan Kulusevski One Of Four Tottenham Players Hit By Viral "Stomach Problem"Tottenham Hotspur's squad was infiltrated by a stomach bug ahead of Sunday's Premier League home game against Burnley.
Spurs manager Antonio Conte revealed in a pre-match interview that Dejan Kulusevski was one of four players who had reported symptoms including sickness on Saturday.
"Honestly, there was a problem because yesterday Kulusevski didn't do the training session.
"Yesterday four players but it is ok. Kulusevski didn't have the training session, but we have Lucas Moura."
Hours before that game, Tottenham requested a postponement after a significant number of players reported having food poisoning, apparently as a consequence of a dodgy lasagna.

Tottenham beat Burnley 1-0 Sunday to move two points above Arsenal in the fight for Champions League qualification.
If Arsenal wins at St. James' Park, Mikel Arteta's team knows another win at home to Everton on the final day would secure a top-four finish.

“Don’t forget we played [three] days ago in a tough game against Arsenal, and before that in Anfield against Liverpool,” he said.

When Kane was contemplating career opportunities in August, Son took the opportunity to score the winner against Manchester City.
There was only one league goal for Nuno, 15 for Antonio Conte.
Kane scored but over the season he has 16 goals and eight assists, Son has 21 and seven respectively.
But a season that threatened to be a write-off for Spurs may yet conclude with them in the Champions League.
