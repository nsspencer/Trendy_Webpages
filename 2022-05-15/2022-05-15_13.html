    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Try as they might, the Kings couldn’t stop Connor McDavid.
Though there were plenty of excellent performances from his teammates as well, McDavid drove the Oilers to two victories while facing elimination.
He was instrumental in helping them earn their first playoff series win in five years.
“The way you defend Connor McDavid is not one-on-one; it’s as a team,” he said.
That’s when McDavid was a sophomore in the league and a first-year captain, and Woodcroft was an Oilers assistant coach under Todd McLellan.
