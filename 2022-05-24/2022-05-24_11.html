     Review: ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ just might take your breath away
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CLEVELAND, Ohio -- “Top Gun” fans who waited (checks notes) 36 years for a sequel can breathe a sigh of relief.
“Top Gun: Maverick,” out Friday, is worth the wait, a nostalgia-filled, adrenalin rush full of high-flying action, stunning visuals and, surprisingly, heart.
The original “Top Gun” was style over substance, not much more than an MTV music video in search of a movie.
But none of that stops “Top Gun: Maverick” from being the kind of wildly entertaining, old-school blockbuster that summers and popcorn were made for.
“Top Gun: Maverick” is rated PG-13 and opens in theaters on Friday with preview screenings on Thursday night.

     Top Gun: Maverick spoiler-free review: A worthy return to the danger zone
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As I walked out of my review screening of Top Gun: Maverick, coming down from its adrenaline-filled finale, a small part of my brain began looking for dents in the film's armor.
I chewed on those thoughts for a second, but before I could lose myself in cataloging them at length, a sensation came over me.
The series' predilection for steering military theater toward Hollywood-style silliness is arguably more tolerable, as tempered by a savvy script and cutting-edge stunt work.
“Don’t think, just do”Top Gun: Maverick has the added benefit of looking incredible on a large screen, and it's perhaps the best IMAX format showcase of the past five years.
Top Gun: Maverick spends a lot of time in this perspective, so it's good to see the stunt teams and cinematographers repeatedly strike a hot beach volleyball high-five over this collaboration.

     'Top Gun: Maverick' is a blast of nostalgia, upgraded action scenes and emotion.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That “Top Gun: Maverick” works so well can surely be attributed to Tom Cruise, who created the title character, rule-floutin', death-cheatin’, heart-breakin’ pilot Pete Mitchell (call sign: Maverick).
“Top Gun: Maverick” hews to the structure of the first movie, punctuating scenes of rivalry, seduction and personal reckonings with increasingly difficult flight tests and simulated dogfights, the whole thing culminating in a genuinely spectacular, climactic real-time battle.
Tom Cruise still has the need for speed, reprising his role as US Naval Aviator Pete "Maverick" Mitchell in this sequel to 1986's "Top Gun."
That last call sign is just one example of the low-key humor that runs through “Top Gun: Maverick,” which gratifyingly never resorts to snark or smug winking.
Among its many virtues, most amazingly, “Top Gun: Maverick” doesn’t feel like a video game or a three-dimensional comic book or an ad for a theme park.
