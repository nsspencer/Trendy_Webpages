     Herschel Walker, backed by Trump, sails to the G.O.P. nomination in Georgia’s Senate race.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Herschel Walker, the former University of Georgia football star pressed into politics by former President Donald J. Trump, won Georgia’s Republican Senate primary on Tuesday, cruising past a crowded field.
With Mr. Trump’s endorsement, Mr. Walker faced five opponents for the nomination — but no real challenge.
Though Mr. Black ultimately could not compete, he may have caused trouble for Mr. Walker.
He doggedly raised allegations of domestic violence against Mr. Walker, some of which Mr. Walker admitted to and some of which he denied, as well as questions about Mr. Walker’s inflated claims of academic and business achievements.
Mr. Black called the accusations of violent behavior and the mental health struggles that Mr. Walker had admitted to “disqualifying,” and said he could not endorse him in the general election.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (1:01)Former Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker won Georgia's GOP Senate primary on Tuesday.
Walker is a political newcomer but has nearly unmatched name recognition in Georgia from his days as a college football running back.
He led the University of Georgia football team to a national title during the 1980 season and won the Heisman Trophy in 1982.
He won the primary despite skipping debates with his Republican opponents and making multiple gaffes on the campaign trail.
The general election between Warnock and Walker will mark the first time that two major party candidates for U.S. Senate in Georgia are Black.

     Georgia's Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker will face off in key US Senate race, CNN projects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Georgia Republicans have nominated former football star Herschel Walker to take on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, CNN projects, in what's expected to be one of the most important US Senate races of the 2022 midterm elections.
His Senate run opened the candidate to scrutiny of his personal life, including the resurfacing of allegations of domestic violence and threats against former romantic partners.
Warnock is Georgia's first Black senator, and Walker would be the second.
Warnock preaches at Martin Luther King Jr.'s former church, Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and has a long record as a civil rights champion.
Walker, meanwhile, has long expressed ambivalence about racial issues.

     Trump-endorsed Senate hopeful Herschel Walker wins Georgia Republican primary, will face Democratic Sen. Warnock, NBC projects
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Herschel Walker, the former pro football player and businessman endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump, will win Georgia's Republican Senate primary race, NBC News projected Tuesday.
Walker will face off against incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in the general election in November, according to NBC.
When the president criticized "the gun lobby," the crowd reacted with an chorus of boos, according to NBC and other outlets.
Many Republican primary candidates have tried to appeal to the party's base by talking up their pro-Trump credentials, even if the former president did not endorse them.
The primary elections will set the table for the November midterms, when Republicans hope to win majority control of the House and Senate.

     Summary: Updated May 24, 2022 at 8:33 PM ETFormer University of Georgia football legend Herschel Walker comfortably secured the state's Republican nomination for U.S. Senate Tuesday, according to a race call by The Associated Press.
After Georgia's U.S. Senate runoffs flipped control of the chamber in 2021, the battle between Warnock and Walker is expected to play a crucial role in the Senate this year, as well.
"While Reverend Warnock continues to do the job for all Georgians, Walker has quickly shown Georgians he's not ready to be a U.S.
Senator," Warnock campaign manager Quentin Fulks wrote.
"As the election continues, our campaign remains confident that when faced with the choice between Reverend Warnock and Walker, Georgians will choose to send Reverend Warnock back to Washington to continue working for them."

     Summary: "Herschel Walker has proven he’s not."
"The more and more people learn about Herschel Walker, candidate for U.S. Senate, the less they are enthused about him," Johnson said.
"The running back Herschel Walker is a Hall of Famer.
"We need to rally around all our nominees — and that includes, obviously now, Herschel Walker," Watson said.
"Herschel Walker is kind, and he’s compassionate," he said before he worried out loud that he had said the wrong thing.
