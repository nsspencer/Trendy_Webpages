     Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 release date revealed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Pocket-lint) - The release date for this year's Call of Duty has been announced as the build-up to a full reveal for Modern Warfare 2 continues - the game will hit shelves on 28 October 2022.
Infinity Ward and Activision came up with a predictably big stunt to announce the date, creating some massive artwork in a docking area, and also updated the game's website with some new information.
Unsurprisingly it confirms that Captain Price and Gaz will be returning after starring in 2019's Modern Warfare reboot, while iconic characters Soap and Ghost will be in Task Force 141 this time around, for the sequel.
The beta will be open to those who pre-order the game, but will have earlier and more sessions on PlayStation, according to CharlieIntel.

     Summary: We won’t be waiting long on this year’s annual Call of Duty release, as there’s already a release date.
On Tuesday, Infinity Ward announced that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is coming out on Oct. 28, 2022.
Along with the release date information, publisher Activision had Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2‘s key art painted on some gigantic shipping boat and nearby dock for some bizarre reason.
It looks like several characters from throughout the Call of Duty series will be in Modern Warfare 2 as well, according to the video’s description on YouTube.
Over the past couple of months, Infinity Ward has been slowly rolling out Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.

     Summary: According to a new teaser video that shows off artwork of the game’s principal cast, including Modern Warfare favorite Simon “Ghost” Riley, Modern Warfare 2 will be released on Oct. 28.
That teaser also reveals a potential reveal date for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2: June 8, a couple days before Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest kicks off.
Modern Warfare 2 is a direct sequel to 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Infinity Ward’s reboot of the sub-brand that started in 2007 with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.
The 2019 Modern Warfare is the most successful Call of Duty title to date, Activision has said.
The original Call of Duty: Warzone was released in March 2020, and was part of the previous Modern Warfare’s season 2 content.

     Summary: Activision has announced the release date for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.

     How Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2's Release Date Compares To Past Games
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just a month ago, Infinity Ward's next project, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was finally announced, after months of speculation and leaks.
Today, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 received an official release date of October 28, 2022.
RELATED: A Pin Feature For Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s HUD Would Be a Game ChangerThanks to its newly revealed October release date, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is somewhat of an outlier compared to the majority of other Call of Duty entries.
When compared to the rest of the Modern Warfare series, the upcoming game's release date fits in fairly well with its predecessors.
Modern Warfare 2's October 28 release date actually matches pretty perfectly with its direct predecessor, Modern Warfare, which released on October 25, 2019.
