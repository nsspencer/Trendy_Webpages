     Summary: Things didn’t get off to the best start for movie version of Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog.

If you missed Sonic 2 in theaters, you’ve got another chance as the film is now available on streaming.
Here is the film’s official synopsis:The world’s favorite blue hedgehog is back for a next-level adventure in SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 2.
