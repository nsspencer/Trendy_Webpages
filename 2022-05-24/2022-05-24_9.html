     Summary: Life, as illuminated in Tuesday’s finale of NBC’s “This is Us,” isn’t tidy – or finite.
Their eulogies are intentionally seen but not heard, a choice Fogelman, who wrote the last two installments, extracted from his own experience.
“You’re as tough as they come, Rebecca Pearson.
“It’s going to be hard to replicate entertainment that means as much to the audience as it does us.
We were never immune to the stories we were telling ... all of us have been really present, and appreciated the ride.

When did Rebecca meet WIlliam (Ron Cephas Jones), and why did she keep it from Randall (Sterling K. Brown)?
Plenty more major and minor twists amassed over six tear-jerking seasons (remember how long we thought Nicky was dead?
Yes, the mere mention of William and Randall’s trip to Memphis is enough to evoke nostalgic sorrow for their heartbreaking goodbye.

And there is something about knowing that, in both little and big ways, they’ll live on with you.
And so I think that’s what the ending is about and it’s kind of what the final shot was saying.
What parts of the episode were filmed earlier on in the series?
So about half to 2/3 of the episode was shot years ago.

Rebecca follows Kevin upstairs and susses out that he’s really upset because he couldn’t do a pull-up in the President’s Physical Fitness Test.
Rebecca’s funeral takes place, and all three of her children speak, though the way the episode is edited means that we don’t hear what they say.

     Summary: Nothing big happens here; it’s full of little scenes with conversations about mostly unimportant things.
How are we supposed to watch shows in which Mandy Moore and Milo Ventimiglia don’t play husband and wife?
She gets that life is about “collecting these little moments” because when you’re young all you want to do is grow up faster, but when you’re old, all you want is to be back in those moments.
It doesn’t matter that she never met Randall’s father: “I know him because I know you,” she tells her dad.
We go back to Rebecca and Jack in bed on that train, and Mom and Dad are looking superhot even in death.
