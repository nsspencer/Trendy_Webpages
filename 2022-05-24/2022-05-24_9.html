     Review: ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ just might take your breath away
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CLEVELAND, Ohio -- “Top Gun” fans who waited (checks notes) 36 years for a sequel can breathe a sigh of relief.
“Top Gun: Maverick,” out Friday, is worth the wait, a nostalgia-filled, adrenalin rush full of high-flying action, stunning visuals and, surprisingly, heart.
The original “Top Gun” was style over substance, not much more than an MTV music video in search of a movie.
But none of that stops “Top Gun: Maverick” from being the kind of wildly entertaining, old-school blockbuster that summers and popcorn were made for.
“Top Gun: Maverick” is rated PG-13 and opens in theaters on Friday with preview screenings on Thursday night.

    </h2>

     'Top Gun: Maverick' is a blast of nostalgia, upgraded action scenes and emotion.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That “Top Gun: Maverick” works so well can surely be attributed to Tom Cruise, who created the title character, rule-floutin', death-cheatin’, heart-breakin’ pilot Pete Mitchell (call sign: Maverick).
“Top Gun: Maverick” hews to the structure of the first movie, punctuating scenes of rivalry, seduction and personal reckonings with increasingly difficult flight tests and simulated dogfights, the whole thing culminating in a genuinely spectacular, climactic real-time battle.
Tom Cruise still has the need for speed, reprising his role as US Naval Aviator Pete "Maverick" Mitchell in this sequel to 1986's "Top Gun."
That last call sign is just one example of the low-key humor that runs through “Top Gun: Maverick,” which gratifyingly never resorts to snark or smug winking.
Among its many virtues, most amazingly, “Top Gun: Maverick” doesn’t feel like a video game or a three-dimensional comic book or an ad for a theme park.

     ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ follows the original movie’s flight pattern, and that’s how we want it
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‘Top Gun: Maverick’UntitledParamount Pictures presents a film directed by Joseph Kosinski and written by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer and Christopher McQuarrie.
One of the students is Rooster (Miles Teller), the resentful son of Maverick’s late friend Goose.
Would it shock you to learn circumstances lead to Maverick being named as the team leader, even though he’s supposed to be grounded?
(The filmmakers miss an easy opportunity to show Maverick’s emotional growth at one point, and I’ll say no more about that.)
“Top Gun: Maverick” is a visceral good time and a worthy salute to the original.
