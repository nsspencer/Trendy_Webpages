    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Aerosmith has canceled some of the band's residency dates in Las Vegas as frontman Steven Tyler seeks rehabilitation treatment.
"As many of you know, our beloved brother Steven has worked on his sobriety for many years," the statement read.
"After foot surgery to prepare for the stage and the necessity of pain management during the process, he has recently relapsed and voluntarily entered a treatment program to concentrate on his health and recovery."
