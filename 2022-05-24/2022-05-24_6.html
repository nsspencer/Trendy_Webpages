     Jacob Trouba sets the tone as New York Rangers even series with Carolina Hurricanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — When asked if there would be any carryover from Game 3 into Game 4 following heated postgame exchanges between the Rangers and Hurricanes, Jacob Trouba brushed the question aside.
With a chance to square up Carolina forward Max Domi near center ice, Trouba unloaded a crushing blow that sent Madison Square Garden into a frenzy.
Frank Vatrano cashed in on the ensuing penalty, setting the course for the Rangers' most complete effort of the playoffs.
It was a tone-setting moment in their effort to even this second-round playoff series at two games apiece.

     Summary: Sign up for our amNY Sports email newsletter to get insights and game coverage for your favorite teamsFinally, some real signs of life from the Rangers’ offense.
Copp led the way with his first-career three-point night in the playoffs (one goal, two assists) to lead the Blueshirts.
It was only the eighth time in his career — the previous seven coming in the regular season — that he recorded a three-point game.
Both goals, the first from Vatrano before Fox’s tally, came on a sputtering power play that had started the series 1-for-7.

     Summary: Shesterkin was again superlative in the Rangers’ 4-1 Game 4 victory over the Hurricanes, setting the tone early with a slide across his crease to get a glove on Brett Pesce’s shot.
Against a Carolina team whose strategy is to shoot the puck at anytime and anyplace, the Rangers have needed that.
Following Tuesday’s game, Gallant was asked whether Shesterkin being in such a zone could make the difference in the series.
“It seems like every game, he’s always making those huge saves,” Ryan Lindgren said.
For the Rangers and for Shesterkin, it is a matter of fact.

     Summary: (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)Tonight, the New York Rangers face another “almost must win” game.
If they are smart, the Rangers will come out hitting, but will keep the hits legal and hopefully throw the Hurricanes off their game.
One interesting element was the Rangers made some subtle changes in their power play strategy after going 0-4 in Game Two and it paid off.
With only one abbreviated power play in Game One, they didn’t have a chance to see the Hurricanes penalty kill until Game Two.

     Rangers Even Second-Round Series Against Hurricanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Andrew Copp had a goal and two assists, and Frank Vatrano and Adam Fox each had a goal and an assist as the New York Rangers beat the Carolina Hurricanes 4-1 in Game 4 Tuesday night, evening the second-round series.
In the series, New York won two at home after opening with two losses at Carolina.
About a minute into the Hurricanes’ advantage, the Rangers had a 2-on-1, short-handed chance but Raanta made a sprawling save on Zibanejad.
The Rangers were unhappy with a fight that broke out at the end of Game 3 on Sunday between Lindgren and Domi.
In this one, Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba delivered a hard hit on Domi along the side boards as the Hurricanes forward was falling to the ice.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Rangers winger Ryan Reaves had some regrets after Game 3 against the Carolina Hurricanes.
Not about the result, which was a 3-1 Rangers victory at Madison Square Garden that cut their series deficit to 2-1.
Meanwhile, Hurricanes defenseman Tony DeAngelo was trading words with the Rangers' bench, causing an irate coach Gerard Gallant to snap back.
In a brief few moments at the end of Game 3, the second-round series between the Rangers and Hurricanes became a series Reaves would love.
While the Hurricanes have sputtered on the power play on the road, going 1-for-19 in the playoffs, the Rangers don't want to tempt fate by taking irresponsible penalties.

     Summary: Game 3 between the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes ended with tensions high and there was some obvious carryover into Tuesday’s Game 4 at Madison Square Garden that saw the Blue Shirts even the series with a 4-1 victory.
The Rangers controlled much of the high-paced action and eventually began winning more puck battles than the Hurricanes.
Then the key turning point of Game 4 occurred.
Rangers head coach Gerard Gallant told the broadcast at the first intermission "it was a great hit" before adding "Domi had his head down a little bit."
The Hurricanes are winless on the road this post-season but perfect at home so they’ll appreciate Game 5 is scheduled for Thursday in Raleigh, N.C.
