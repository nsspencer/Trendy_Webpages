     Hunter x Hunter: Killua Voice Actress Mariya Ise Shares Her Hype With Artwork
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: You heard the news by now, on May 24, Yoshihiro Togashi created a Twitter account and teased he’s working on Hunter x Hunter again.
Seeing he made a Twitter account, this could mean we’ll get slightly more frequent status updates for future Hunter x Hunter chapters, though this is only speculation on my part.
Mariya Ise (Killua) and Megumi Han (Gon) Each Share Manga Artwork of Their Characters on TwitterSoon after Togashi’s tweet started going viral and was confirmed to be authentic, Megumi Han and Mariya Ise both shared iconic artwork from the manga.
The two seiyuu (Japanese voice actors and actresses) started voicing Gon and Killua with the 2011 anime remake.
Whenever the new Hunter x Hunter chapters are done, an official announcement will be made regarding their release schedule in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine.

     Summary: More chapters of the Hunter x Hunter manga may be coming in the near-ish future, potentially ending a years-long hiatus for the series.
One Punch Man artist Yusuke Murata says that the account is Togashi, and Polygon has reached out to Viz Media, U.S. publisher of Hunter x Hunter, for confirmation.
The most recent volume of Hunter x Hunter came out in 2018 in Japan.
Togashi started Hunter x Hunter in 1998.
While Gon’s adventures have mostly finished up after the wild Chimera Ant arc, the most recent manga volumes pivoted to Kurapika.

     ‘Hunter x Hunter’ Creator Yoshihiro Togashi Ending Hiatus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yoshihiro Togashi, the creator of the beloved shonen manga Hunter x Hunter, has appeared to join Twitter and teased new chapters of the series in his very first tweet.
The math started mathing for Hunter x Hunter fans, who are hoping there will be new installments of the manga on the way.
Togashi’s long hiatus can be partially explained by his longstanding health issues — including back pain so bad he became bedridden — which are detailed in a series of Hunter x Hunter author’s notes.
First published in 1998, Hunter x Hunter depicts a world where licensed Hunters are charged with rounding up monsters and criminals, embarking on treasure hunts, and surveying new lands and creatures.
Hunter x Hunter stans, your wait has not been in vain.

     Hunter x Hunter Creator Joins Twitter, Reveals Manga’s Long Hiatus Is Ending
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hunter x Hunter, created by Yoshihiro Togashi, is about a boy named Gon and his journey as a hunter.
The Hunter x Hunter faithful, believing Gon and friend’s adventures would continue, went so far as to create a hiatus chart for Hunter x Hunter that tracks its appearances in Shonen Jump magazine against the days it’s been on hiatus.
AdvertisementIf you haven’t steeped yourself in Hunter x Hunter yet (which you should) but have watched the irreverent “Big Three” anime Naruto, know that Hunter x Hunter’s early adventures are basically Naruto’s first three story arcs (y’know, the good ones).
That’s because Hunter x Hunter served as inspiration for Masashi Kishimoto’s magnum opus.
Over the years, Togashi enlightened readers on his workflow while being bedridden for severe back issues in a series of Hunter x Hunter author’s notes.

Yoshihiro Togashi, the manga artist behind the popular shonen battle anime, joined Twitter on Monday and appeared to tease new chapters of the series.
