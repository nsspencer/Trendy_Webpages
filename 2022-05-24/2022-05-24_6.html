     Sick ‘Crimes of the Future’ scenes spark Cannes walkout in first 5 minutes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Audience members sickened by horrific scenes in “Crimes of the Future” reportedly walked out of the premiere at the Cannes Film Festival Monday.
Horrific body-horror scenes from “Crimes of the Future” were too much for some Cannes Film Festival audience members to handle.
The film centers on two performance artists who grow and remove human organs onstage as the human species adapts to a synthetic environment.
NeonThe film is filled with horrific scenes of child autopsies, bloody intestines, body mutations and people orgasming while licking open wounds.
Cronenberg expected that audience members wouldn’t be able to handle his grotesque body-horror style.

     ‘Crimes Of The Future’s David Cronenberg Slams Conservative U.S. Politics: “In Canada…We Think Everyone In The U.S. Is Completely Insane” – Cannes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NEON release opens on June 3 at a time when Roe vs. Wade is in jeopardy at SCOTUS.
But to me, all art is political or innately political.
Consider it intentional on behalf of the Crash filmmaker and a nod to the burgeoning use of microplastics in the globe.
“It’s a Jonathan Swift, modest proposal, satirical suggestion, but at the same time there’s some reality,” Cronenberg conceded.
Deadline’s Todd McCarthy exclaimed about the pic, the filmmaker’s sixth title at Cannes, “Cronenberg hasn’t made exactly a comedy with Crimes of the Future.

     Summary: The film stars Kristen Stewart, Viggo Mortensen, and Léa Seydoux.
The film was booed by audiences at the 1996 Cannes film festival but received a special jury prize.
Yes, but it's a tough, depressing watchKristen Stewart and Viggo Mortensen in "Crimes of The Future."
Kristen Stewart, Viggo Mortensen, and Léa Seydoux, who lead the film's creepy ensemble, are a seductive and transfixing trio.

     Cannes Review: 'Crimes of the Future' Is Silly, Elegant, and Might Make You Squirm a Little
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But in movies, a vibe can often carry you much further than ideas can, and Crimes of the Future—playing in competition at the 75th Cannes Film Festival—has vibes to spare.
You might not call this picture a major achievement—it’s both elegant and rather silly—but you can’t fault it for lack of vision.
Saul lies face-up in its sarcophagus-like confines as spiderlike half-organic, half mechanical arms slice into his skin with tiny scalpels.
Caprice and Saul are the darlings of this brave new art world, in which body alterations of all sorts have become the rage.
With Crimes of the Future, Cronenberg paints a doomy tomorrow in which some humans have gone so far in altering their bodies—with piercings, surgeries, and all manner of stretching and manipulations—that they mess up the natural order of things.

     Summary: Several audience members walked out of the screening of Crimes of the Future during Cannes Film Festival on Monday night due to the film's graphic scenes.
'Accompanied by his partner, celebrity performance artist Saul Tenser showcases the metamorphosis of his organs.
Crimes Of The Future marks Canadian auteur David’s long-awaited return to body horror, and he shot the entire film in Greece.
The evolution moves humans behind their 'natural state' and into a new metamorphosis that alters their biological makeup, known as Accelerated Evolution Syndrome.
