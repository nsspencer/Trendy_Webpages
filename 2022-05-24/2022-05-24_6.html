     Florida Panthers ‘aspire to be’ the Tampa Bay Lightning. And why not?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TAMPA — As the Florida Panthers exited the handshake line with the Tampa Bay Lightning, they found themselves in a very similar situation as the twice-defending Stanley Cup Champions were back in 2019.
After that series, Lightning coach Jon Cooper took stock of the situation.
The Lightning blocked 77 Panthers shots as Florida continued to struggle to generate high-danger chances throughout the series.
Stamkos only had four points (two goals) but did a lot of other things to keep the Panthers off balance.
“They play their way, we play our way, but I think what we’re learning is all of the little things they do to win hockey games,” Brunette said.

     Morning After Thoughts: The Lightning Legacy Continues to March Forward
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Six Eastern Conference Final appearances in eight years, more than any other team has in the entire Salary Cap Era.
Three Conference Final appearances in a row, a feat only matched by the Chicago Blackhawks (2013-15), Detroit Red Wings (2007-09), and Los Angeles Kings (2012-14) in the Salary Cap Era.
This continued stretch of deep playoff runs and championships feels unprecedented in the salary cap era.
Our team made the second round this year, which means we'll be better next year and make the conference final or the cup!
They already have a legacy in the NHL, they are already one of the three most incredible teams of the salary cap era, and they will be remembered as such.

     Summary: The Lightning have become ingrained in Tampa Bay in a way that no other franchise has quite pulled off.
But there’s something special about the way the Lightning reinvented themselves after the heartache of the 2019 postseason collapse.
They went from a team that dazzled you with skill to a group that impressed you with heart.
And from the moment Brayden Point scored the overtime winner against the Maple Leafs, the Lightning have been a team reborn.

     Summary: TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Jon Cooper had every reason to be confident the two-time defendin Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning could keep their bid for a three-peat alive.
I’m just trying to do my job as best I can.”Story continuesPat Maroon, chasing his fourth consecutive Stanley Cup title, snapped a scoreless tie a little over six minutes into the third period.
The Lightning joined the New York Islanders and Montreal Canadiens as the only franchises to win at least 10 consecutive playoff series.
