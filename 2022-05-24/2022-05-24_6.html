     Rangers get even in Game 4 win; another big Trouba hit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With their 4-1 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on Tuesday night they have drawn even in their Second Round series after winning both games at Madison Square Garden.
They will now play a pivotal Game 5 in Carolina on Thursday night.
This is now the second series in a row the Rangers looked done early, facing a two game deficit, only to come back.
Another big Jacob Trouba hitJacob Trouba has developed quite a reputation for controversial big hits in recent years, and he added another one to the list on Tuesday night in Game 4 of the New York Rangers-Carolina Hurricanes series.
The bad news is the Rangers have clearly adjusted following a slow start in the series while Shesterkin is finding his game.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This was as close to a laugher as we have had in this series as the New York Rangers never trailed in a 4-1 win at Madison Square Garden.
The teams followed the script with all the games won by the home team in this series.
In fact, the Hurricanes are yet to win on the road this postseason, winning all six home games and losing all five road games.
Of course, for the Rangers to win this series, they have to break that streak.
At 11:38, Jacob Trouba laid a big hit on Domi that turned the tide for the Blueshirts and gave them the impetus for the win.

     Summary: Vin A. CherwooAssociated PressNew York — The New York Rangers got the kind of strong, all-around effort from the start they needed and stormed past the Carolina Hurricanes.
However, Copp scored from the right side with just under nine minutes remaining.
The Rangers pushed their lead to 3-0 with 3:12 left in the middle period as Lindgren fired a shot that Raanta stopped.
Vatrano took advantage as he fired a one-timer off a pass from Copp past Raanta with 6:29 left.
He has 25 points in 11 playoff games for the Oilers, who earned a third straight victory over their provincial rival.

     New York Rangers relish 'added nastiness' against Hurricanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Rangers winger Ryan Reaves had some regrets after Game 3 against the Carolina Hurricanes.
Not about the result, which was a 3-1 Rangers victory at Madison Square Garden that cut their series deficit to 2-1.
Meanwhile, Hurricanes defenseman Tony DeAngelo was trading words with the Rangers' bench, causing an irate coach Gerard Gallant to snap back.
In a brief few moments at the end of Game 3, the second-round series between the Rangers and Hurricanes became a series Reaves would love.
While the Hurricanes have sputtered on the power play on the road, going 1-for-19 in the playoffs, the Rangers don't want to tempt fate by taking irresponsible penalties.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shesterkin was again superlative in the Rangers’ 4-1 Game 4 victory over the Hurricanes, setting the tone early with a slide across his crease to get a glove on Brett Pesce’s shot.
Against a Carolina team whose strategy is to shoot the puck at anytime and anyplace, the Rangers have needed that.
Following Tuesday’s game, Gallant was asked whether Shesterkin being in such a zone could make the difference in the series.
“It seems like every game, he’s always making those huge saves,” Ryan Lindgren said.
For the Rangers and for Shesterkin, it is a matter of fact.

     Rangers Even Second-Round Series Against Hurricanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Andrew Copp had a goal and two assists, and Frank Vatrano and Adam Fox each had a goal and an assist as the New York Rangers beat the Carolina Hurricanes 4-1 in Game 4 Tuesday night, evening the second-round series.
In the series, New York won two at home after opening with two losses at Carolina.
About a minute into the Hurricanes’ advantage, the Rangers had a 2-on-1, short-handed chance but Raanta made a sprawling save on Zibanejad.
The Rangers were unhappy with a fight that broke out at the end of Game 3 on Sunday between Lindgren and Domi.
In this one, Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba delivered a hard hit on Domi along the side boards as the Hurricanes forward was falling to the ice.
