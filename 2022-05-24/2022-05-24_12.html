     Why Mandy Moore Doesn't Remember Filming This Is Us Finale Scenes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was an emotional episode for Mandy Moore , who opened up about the scene that made her actually throw up when she read the script.
In fact, she doesn’t even remember filming most of the finale scenes.
Mandy Moore took viewers on quite a journey as Rebecca (which is worth an Emmy Award, if you ask Sterling K. Brown ) in Season 6.
I’m intrigued about which finale scenes would have had to be filmed alongside scenes from other seasons, rather than putting the actors back in whatever age makeup the finale required.
Will we dive deeper into some experiences we’ve already been through, or see past scenes expanded in some way?

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Singer-songwriter and “This is Us” star Mandy Moore is performing at the Carolina Theatre of Durham on June 12 as part of her In Real Life Tour.
Moore’s In Real Life Tour launches June 10 in Atlanta and will stop at the Carolina Theatre of Durham on June 12.
The germ of this album really came from one song, the last song on the record.
Moore: I’m well aware that there are probably plenty of people who had no idea that I did music before the show.
Moore: I’m excited to figure that out and allow myself a little distance to figure out how this experience shaped me and what I want to do in the future.
