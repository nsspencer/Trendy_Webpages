     Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler voluntarily enters rehab after relapse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aerosmith announced it is canceling the June and July dates of its Las Vegas residency after the band's frontman, Steven Tyler, voluntarily entered rehab.
Tyler, 74, underwent foot surgery to "prepare for the stage," which necessitated pain management medication, the band said in a statement Tuesday.
Tyler relapsed and "voluntarily entered a treatment program to concentrate on his health and recovery."
The band was scheduled to start performing at Dolby Live at Park MGM in Las Vegas on June 17.
Tyler has been open about addiction, and in 2019, he talked about the intervention his management and bandmates staged in 1988.

     Steven Tyler enters treatment after relapsing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Aerosmith has canceled some of the band's residency dates in Las Vegas as frontman Steven Tyler seeks rehabilitation treatment.
"As many of you know, our beloved brother Steven has worked on his sobriety for many years," the statement read.
"After foot surgery to prepare for the stage and the necessity of pain management during the process, he has recently relapsed and voluntarily entered a treatment program to concentrate on his health and recovery."
Tyler has been open about his substance abuse in the past.
Tyler told CNN in 2017 that he was inspired to open Janie's House, a home for abused and neglected girls just outside Atlanta, after meeting women during a stint in rehab who were seeking treatment, in part, because of the abuse they had endured.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aerosmith is canceling the first set of dates of its Las Vegas residency so lead singer Steven Tyler can seek treatment for substance use.
The legendary rock band announced the news Tuesday in a statement on its social media pages, explaining that Tyler, 74, is voluntarily entering a treatment program after relapsing following a surgery on his foot.
After scoring massive success in the 1970s, he and his bandmates "became very f----- up" on drugs, Tyler recalled.
I was the first one to get treatment," said Tyler.
However, years later, Tyler, who, according to Rolling Stone, sought treatment in 2009 for an addiction to prescription pain killers, realized the intervention was for the best.
