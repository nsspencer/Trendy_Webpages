     On Somber Night, Mavericks’ Crucial Win Draws Muted Celebration
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a skyscraper, the ball hurtling toward the rafters before plummeting to Earth.
It took one hard bounce off the court and then rattled through the hoop.
As they waded into Tuesday’s playoff game against the Golden State Warriors, the Mavericks had to be wondering whether they could make shots with any consistency.
While Doncic’s circus shot didn’t count, the degree of difficulty was outrageous.
And for a team on the ropes, it was a sign of good things to come.

     Rain delays second half of Golden State Warriors-Dallas Mavericks game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS -- Golden State's Splash Brothers were trying not to get wet at the start of the second half Tuesday night as water leaked through the roof of the American Airlines Center, delaying Game 4 of the Western Conference finals between the Warriors and Mavericks by 16 minutes.
This was the second time water dripping through the American Airlines Center roof affected a Mavericks game.
It also delayed the start of a Timberwolves-Mavericks game by 15 minutes back on March 21.
The Mavericks led 62-47 at the half.
Once the game resumed, the Mavericks continued to build on their lead, jumping out to a 99-70 advantage by the end of the third quarter and going on to win 119-109.

     Dallas Mavericks Game 4 Delayed After Leaky Roof at AAC
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The start of the second half of Game 4 of the Western Conference finals was delayed 16 minutes because of rain leaking through the roof Tuesday night at the American Airlines Center.
With heavy rain falling outside, there were at least two leaks, one dropping water near the Golden State bench.
There was another leak at the end of the court where the Dallas Mavericks bench is, though water there appeared to be falling in the stands.
Both teams had already warmed up for the second half before the leaks were noticed.
There were eventually five minutes added to the halftime break to allow extra warmup for players for both teams before play finally resumed with the Mavericks up 62-47.

    </h2>

     Summary: That was Luka Doncic's ultimate message when asked what changed in this game.
I think our defense was amazing today," Luka said.
When asked how Dallas adjusted to Golden State's zone, Luka said, "It's different.
It will be tough for Dallas in Golden State, as the Warriors have been dominant on their home floor all season, but they are not ready to quit.
Despite the loss, Golden State has shown an incredible ability to bounce back this postseason, and will look to do so again on Thursday evening.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Golden State Warriors 119-109 in Game 4 to stave off elimination for at least one more night.
Steph Curry had 20 in defeat for Golden State.
Still, the water coming in through the roof couldn’t extinguish the shooting night the Dallas Mavericks were having.
Golden State made it more interesting than it should’ve been with Dallas sporting a 29-point lead heading to the fourth that was, at one point, cut to just eight.
In both instances, those leads were quickly wiped off the board in the third by Golden State.

     Summary: After a competitive first quarter, the Mavericks opened up a double-digit lead in the second quarter and led by 15 heading into the break.
Luka Doncic was not as his most efficient, but led the way with 30 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists.
They doubled up the Warriors from the outside, outscoring them by 30 points from 3-point land, which was too big of a margin to make up.
While he wasn't at his most efficient, he was doing everything for the Mavericks and finished with 30 points, 14 rebounds, nine assists, two steals and two blocks.
There are few players who can control a game like Doncic, and he was not going to let the Mavericks lose.

     The Dallas Mavericks turned into pumpkins
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: First-year coach Jason Kidd has turned the Mavericks into a capable defensive force.
Online and in Buffalo Wild Wings across Dallas, Mavs fans began to drink the Kool-Aid, believing this year would look like 2011.
But against the Warriors, Dončić has had to take on a Herculean level of excellence just for the Mavericks to get blown out by 30 every game.
After game two of the Warriors series, only 11 of Dončić’s 100 shots were assisted upon.
AdvertisementThe problem is none of the names make Dallas a contender, but they seem realistic targets considering the Mav’s available trade assets.
