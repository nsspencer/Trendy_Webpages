     Judge Denies Johnny Depp’s Motion To Strike Amber Heard’s $100 Million Defamation Counterclaim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The judge in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial rejected the actor’s effort to reject his $100 million counterclaim.
Heard’s counterclaim centers on statements made by an attorney for Depp, Adam Waldman, who claimed in a Daily Mail interview that the actresses’ allegations of domestic abuse were fabricated.
Depp’s attorney Benjamin Chew argued for their motion on Tuesday morning, just before Heard’s legal team rested their case.
The judge previously denied Heard’s motion to strike Depp’s case.
“As to actual malice, Mr. Waldman made the counterclaim statements after he met with his client,” the judge said.

     Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial: Warner Bros. Executive Says Concerns Over Casting Actress In ‘Aquaman’ Sequel Had To Do With Her Chemistry With Jason Momoa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actor Amber Heard speaks with her attorney Elaine Bredehoft in the courtroom at the Fairfax County Circuit Courthouse in Fairfax.
Johnny Depp’s legal team started their rebuttal testimony on Tuesday with the video deposition of Walter Hamada, the Warner Bros. executive who said that their concerns over casting Amber Heard in the Aquaman sequel had to do with her chemistry with Jason Momoa.
He did say that Momoa’s pay for the Aquaman sequel was renegotiated.
He also suggested that the size of Heard’s role was determined by the early development of the script in 2018.
On Monday, producer Kathryn Arnold, an expert witness for Heard, testified that Momoa and Wan advocated for the actress to get the role in the sequel.

     Summary: Depp’s attorneys also called a witness to challenge the idea that Depp was physically abusive to Heard: the surgeon David Kulber, who operated on Depp’s injured finger.
Asked if Depp could have grabbed someone with a splint on the finger, Kulber said Depp “could attempt to grab someone.
The supermodel was invited to testify after Heard said she hit Depp to protect her sister Whitney Henriquez during a dispute in the couple’s penthouse.
Heard testified that Henriquez was standing near a staircase, and immediately thought about rumors that Depp had pushed Moss down a flight of steps.
Likely to come up when attorneys question Moss is a story Depp once told about talking to Hunter S Thompson, the journalist and a hero of Depp’s.

     Johnny Depp was ‘cowering’ as Amber Heard yelled at him, a witness for Depp testifies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The protracted defamation trial between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard got a little spicy Tuesday as two of Depp’s rebuttal witnesses contradicted some of Heard’s harshest allegations.
At one point he was speaking to Depp one on one and Heard said she wanted to talk to her then-boyfriend.
If Johnny Depp sued Amber Heard for defamation just to prove that there are people who still think he’s a big movie star, he’s won.
Depp testified previously that he never struck Heard.
Heard testified previously that she had to “fight” for the role because of blowback after getting a temporary restraining order against Depp when they split up.

     Johnny Depp Loses Bid to Dismiss Amber Heard’s Counterclaim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Virginia judge on Tuesday denied Johnny Depp’s motion to dismiss Amber Heard’s counterclaim, ruling that the issue should be decided by the jury.
Ben Rottenborn, Heard’s attorney, argued that Waldman was acting as Depp’s lawyer, and that Depp is therefore responsible for Waldman’s conduct.
Heard’s attorneys also made a similar motion to dismiss Depp’s underlying defamation suit after Depp’s team rested their case on May 3.
Azcarate denied that motion as well, meaning that the jury will have to decide both Depp’s suit and Heard’s counterclaim.
Depp’s team is set to present witnesses on Tuesday and Wednesday to rebut Heard’s counterclaim, and closing statements are scheduled for Friday.
