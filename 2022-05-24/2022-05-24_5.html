     Hunter x Hunter Creator Joins Twitter, Reveals Manga’s Long Hiatus Is Ending
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hunter x Hunter, created by Yoshihiro Togashi, is about a boy named Gon and his journey as a hunter.
The Hunter x Hunter faithful, believing Gon and friend’s adventures would continue, went so far as to create a hiatus chart for Hunter x Hunter that tracks its appearances in Shonen Jump magazine against the days it’s been on hiatus.
AdvertisementIf you haven’t steeped yourself in Hunter x Hunter yet (which you should) but have watched the irreverent “Big Three” anime Naruto, know that Hunter x Hunter’s early adventures are basically Naruto’s first three story arcs (y’know, the good ones).
That’s because Hunter x Hunter served as inspiration for Masashi Kishimoto’s magnum opus.
Over the years, Togashi enlightened readers on his workflow while being bedridden for severe back issues in a series of Hunter x Hunter author’s notes.

     ‘Hunter x Hunter’ Creator Yoshihiro Togashi Ending Hiatus
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Yoshihiro Togashi, the creator of the beloved shonen manga Hunter x Hunter, has appeared to join Twitter and teased new chapters of the series in his very first tweet.
The math started mathing for Hunter x Hunter fans, who are hoping there will be new installments of the manga on the way.
Togashi’s long hiatus can be partially explained by his longstanding health issues — including back pain so bad he became bedridden — which are detailed in a series of Hunter x Hunter author’s notes.
First published in 1998, Hunter x Hunter depicts a world where licensed Hunters are charged with rounding up monsters and criminals, embarking on treasure hunts, and surveying new lands and creatures.
Hunter x Hunter stans, your wait has not been in vain.
