     Summary: Staff and wire reportsA Warner Bros. executive testified Tuesday that Amber Heard's role in "Aquaman 2," as well as her ability to renegotiate her contract, were not impacted by any statements made by her ex-husband Johnny Depp or his representatives.

     Jason Momoa and James Wan blocked efforts to cut Amber Heard out of Aquaman 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Johnny Depp/Amber Heard defamation trial continues to skulk its way across the seafloor of the online subconscious this week, occasionally vomiting up some industry factoid or moment of strangeness that inevitably rises to the surface to be fitfully dissected and perused.
Which was “significant,” in Arnold’s telling, most notably as it applied to Heard’s starring role in the Aquaman sub-franchise of Warner Bros. films.
As such, Warner Bros. told Heard she was functionally disinvited from FanDome, the company’s now-annual celebration of its brands and various film properties.
AdvertisementBeyond that, the studio reportedly pushed to have her removed from Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom outright, only being stopped by a united front from co-star Jason Momoa and director James Wan.
Per Arnold’s testimony, Wan and Momoa were both “ committed to her” and were “ adamant she was in the film.” Even so, Heard has testified that her part in the film was cut back, officially because of a supposed lack of chemistry with Momoa.

     Warner Bros. Considered Replacing Amber Heard in ‘Aquaman 2’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The president of DC Films testified Tuesday that the studio considered replacing Amber Heard for “Aquaman 2” out of concern that she lacked chemistry with star Jason Momoa.
Heard is seeking $100 million in a defamation counterclaim against Depp.
Heard was paid $1 million for the first “Aquaman,” and $2 million for the sequel.
However, Hamada testified that under his leadership at DC Films, he has made a point of not automatically renegotiating for sequels.
Heard has alleged that her role was “pared down” considerably over time, but Hamada testified it has remained static since the film was first developed in 2018.

     Summary: Hamada — who has been president of DC Films since 2018 — alleged it was always intended for Heard to have a smaller role in the film franchise.
APAlthough Heard managed to keep her spot in the sequel, she alleged that her role was significantly reduced.
Meanwhile, since the trial started, more than 4 million Depp fans have flocked to sign a petition urging DC Films to drop Heard from “Aquaman 2” altogether.
The first “Aquaman” film — released in 2018 — was a box office smash, grossing more than $1 billion across the globe.

     Summary: Amber Heard was almost booted from the Aquaman sequel.
Hamada said the studio’s concern was about the lack of chemistry between Heard and Jason Momoa, who stars as Aquaman.
The chemistry wasn’t there.
“I had to fight really hard to keep my career,” Heard testified May 17.
All that said, Hamada noted the original Aquaman still worked, and said that test audiences rated Heard highly.

     Amber Heard almost lost ‘Aquaman’ role over ‘chemistry,’ not controversy, exec says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When it came time to shoot the film “Aquaman,” Amber Heard almost lost her gig as Aquaman’s love interest, Mera.
But according to a studio executive, it had nothing to do with any drama between her and ex-husband Johnny Depp, as Heard had claimed.
Experts for Heard and the actor herself testified previously that drama with Depp almost cost her the “Aquaman” role.
But because of the lack of chemistry between the two, Hamada said, the studio considered recasting the role rather than making the 2018 follow-up movie, “Aquaman,” with Heard.
“So at the end of the day, I think if you watch the movie, they look like they had great chemistry,” Hamada said.
