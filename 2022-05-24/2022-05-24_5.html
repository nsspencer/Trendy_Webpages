     Summary: Stewart told Cronenberg she had no clue what the movie was about while filming, but "maybe we can just figure it out" together.
Even Kristen Stewart was kept in the dark during production about the mind-warping “Crimes of the Future” plot.
“Crimes of the Future” premiered at Cannes and will debut in theaters June 3.
“Everyone loves to talk about how his movies are difficult to watch, and it’s fun to talk about people walking out of Cannes screenings,” Stewart said.
“I’ve had moments where things were forbidden, things were bad, things were taboo,” Cronenberg said.

     Summary: Audience members sickened by horrific scenes in “Crimes of the Future” reportedly walked out of the premiere at the Cannes Film Festival Monday.
Horrific body-horror scenes from “Crimes of the Future” were too much for some Cannes Film Festival audience members to handle.
The film centers on two performance artists who grow and remove human organs onstage as the human species adapts to a synthetic environment.
NeonThe film is filled with horrific scenes of child autopsies, bloody intestines, body mutations and people orgasming while licking open wounds.
Cronenberg expected that audience members wouldn’t be able to handle his grotesque body-horror style.

     ‘Crimes Of The Future’s David Cronenberg Slams Conservative U.S. Politics: “In Canada…We Think Everyone In The U.S. Is Completely Insane” – Cannes
    </h2>

     Summary: The NEON release opens on June 3 at a time when Roe vs. Wade is in jeopardy at SCOTUS.
But to me, all art is political or innately political.
Consider it intentional on behalf of the Crash filmmaker and a nod to the burgeoning use of microplastics in the globe.
“It’s a Jonathan Swift, modest proposal, satirical suggestion, but at the same time there’s some reality,” Cronenberg conceded.
Deadline’s Todd McCarthy exclaimed about the pic, the filmmaker’s sixth title at Cannes, “Cronenberg hasn’t made exactly a comedy with Crimes of the Future.

     "Disturbingly sexy": Kristen Stewart and Viggo Mortensen's sex-horror Crimes of the Future is dividing audiences
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Whispers and murmurs that floated across the Croisette from the beginning of the fest on Thursday promised an indulgently horrid affair.
Cronenberg himself said he expected walkouts within the first five minutes, ramping up hopes for the devilish sight of the Cannes respectable flocking auditoriums in their haute-couture.
But the promised stampede of incredulous virtue did not follow; some squirmed, but most remained in their seats.
Despite early reports to the contrary, the film simply isn't that shocking.
If it shares any connecting tissue with Cronenberg's earlier filmography, it's via eXistenz, a fascinating but altogether tamer take on the director's old-school affinity for gore.
