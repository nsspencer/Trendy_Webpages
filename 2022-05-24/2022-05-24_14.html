     Ricky Gervais draws backlash for jokes about transgender people in new Netflix special
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) A week before the start of Pride Month, comedian Ricky Gervais is being criticized for his new stand-up special, in which he mocks transgender women and the debate around bathroom access.
The special, called "SuperNature," debuted Tuesday on Netflix.
A few minutes into the set, Gervais describes reading a comment from somebody calling him "as funny as a fart at a baby's funeral," and transitions to a joke about women.
From there, he clarifies: "The old-fashioned women, the ones with wombs."
"And now the old-fashioned ones say, 'Oh, they want to use our toilets.'

     Summary: Netflix has reaffirmed its commitment to transphobic comedy with Ricky Gervais’ latest special SuperNature.
The old-fashioned women, the ones with wombs.
And now the old-fashioned ones say, ‘Oh, they want to use our toilets.’ ‘Why shouldn’t they use your toilets?’ ‘For ladies!’ ‘They are ladies—look at their pronouns!
Perhaps most bafflingly, the comedian claims at the end of the special: “In real life of course I support trans rights.
I support all human rights, and trans rights are human rights.” He then adds, “Live your best life.

     Netflix Under Fire—Again—Over Trans Jokes, This Time By Ricky Gervais
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineSeven months after dozens of Netflix staffers walked out of work to protest a Dave Chappelle comedy special critics called transphobic, the streaming service immediately came under fire by releasing a special from comedian Ricky Gervais, who jokes about trans women.
Describing how Kevin Hart lost his Oscars hosting gig in 2018 due to resurfaced tweets, Gervais again brings up trans women, saying “the worst thing you can say today is, ‘Women don’t have penises,’ right?
We didn’t think we fucking had to!” In another part of the special, Gervais says he “support[s] trans rights.
I support all human rights, and trans rights are human rights,” and urges his audience to “live your best life” and “use your preferred pronouns,” before joking “but meet me halfway, ladies.
In a 2018 Netflix special Humanity, Gervais made remarks about Caitlyn Jenner, who is transgender.
