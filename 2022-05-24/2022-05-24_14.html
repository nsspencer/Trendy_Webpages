     Summary: Clay Travis was joined by current candidate for the Senate seat in Georgia, Herschel Walker, who discussed why he decided to run and how he believes he can help the state of Georgia.
When asked about the All-Star game being pulled out of Atlanta, Walker pointed out that the ironic thing about that is “they pulled the game and took it to a place that had more strenuous border rights than Georgia, and yet they see that there’s been more people that vote in this election than [have] voted in a long time.”The OutKick founder also discussed legendary Georgia football coach, Vince Dooley, supporting Walker in the Georgia Senate Race.
The former UGA running back said “to have Coach Dooley introduce me…[it brings] tears to my eyes.”“When you have your teammates and you have coaches that stand behind you right now that say you’re gonna be a good senator in the United States of America, you’re gonna be a good senator for the state of Georgia, these people, they trust in you and they don’t take it lightly,” Walker continued.

     Summary: Herschel Walker’s background has received a fair amount of scrutiny in recent months, and for good reason.
The problem for Walker, however, is that the closer one looks at his personal and professional experiences, the less credible his first-time candidacy appears.
In reality, Walker didn’t help create it — he was a paid celebrity spokesperson — and it was not (and is not) a charity.
It was a program created years earlier by Universal Health Services, which paid the former football player a salary of $331,000 last year.
Two years ago, Universal Health Services denied the allegations, but reached a $122 million settlement with federal prosecutors and a coalition of states.
