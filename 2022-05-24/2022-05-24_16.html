     Henry Kissinger says Ukraine must make Russia concessions to end conflict
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said Tuesday that Ukraine must be willing to make concessions to end the conflict with Russia and avoid "a new war against Russia itself."
The former official urged Western forces not to attempt a total defeat of Russia in Ukraine, saying that such an outcome would destabilize Europe and fracture international relationships.
Kissinger pushed Western powers to use negotiation to draw the conflict to an end, warning against any further military escalation.
"Pursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine, but a new war against Russia itself."
Kissinger warned his audience that pushing further with embargoes or military might would risk sparking an all-out war with Russia.

     Henry Kissinger: Ukraine Should Give Up Territory to Russia to Reach Peace
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former secretary of state Henry Kissinger has said Ukraine should accept giving up part of its territory to reach a peace deal with Russia, and end the now three-month-long war immediately.
Pursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine, but a new war against Russia itself."
Russia has declared it is open to the possibility of restarting peace talks if Ukraine makes the first step, as announced by Russian deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko on Monday.
But, Ukraine has appeared to be increasingly uncompromising over reaching a peace agreement that sees Kyiv giving up part of its territory to Moscow.
Over the past week, other Ukrainian officials have made strong statements against the possibility of reaching a peace agreement that involves ceding any territory to Russia.

     Henry Kissinger Is Wrong: Ukraine Should Get Russian Territory
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Henry Kissinger is wrong on Ukraine: Fortitude and the West have become, in the name of sophisticated diplomacy, mutually exclusive.
In his most recent insertion into the public debate, the former Secretary of State and National Security Advisor argues, that in the name of realpolitik, Ukraine should accept neutrality and forfeit territory to Russia.
As Putin guides Russia ever more to the extreme, neutrality between Russia and the West would require Ukraine to march halfway to the extreme.
The narrative that the West humiliated Russia or betrayed its word to Moscow after the fall of the Cold War is false.
The only effective response to Putin, should he want peace, is to forfeit Russian territory to Ukraine as part of the reparations he should pay.

     Henry Kissinger tells Davos elite to give in to Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a discussion on Monday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger shared his concerns about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
It is not the West that is lost “in the mood of the moment” but Kissinger himself.
Admitting Finland will more than double the pact’s border with Russia, and Russia is preemptively halting gas exports to Finland.
By referring to the separatist Donetsk and Luhansk regions as “Russia itself,” Kissinger concludes that Russian might alone is enough to justify their demands.
Only at Davos would a former secretary of state label Western defeat as “wisdom.”James Sweet is a summer 2022 Washington Examiner fellow.

He wrote: “As easily as Mr. #Kissinger proposes to give (Russia) part of (Ukraine) to stop the war, he would allow to take Poland or Lithuania away.” Podolyak added.

Ideally, the dividing line should be a return to the status quo ante,” said Kissinger, 98, according to the Daily Telegraph.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has emphasized that part of his conditions for entering peace talks with Russia would include a restoration of preinvasion borders.
“As easily as Mr. #Kissinger proposes to give [Russia] part of [Ukraine] to stop the war, he would allow to take Poland or Lithuania away,” Podolyak said.
