     Yoshihiro Togashi Apparently Confirms New Hunter x Hunter Chapters in the Works
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The acclaimed and imaginative manga Hunter x Hunter has not had any new chapters since 2018, and the series has been no stranger to hiatuses since publication began back in 1998.
Via Nibel, manga creator Yoshihiro Togashi has apparently opened a Twitter account and declared that at least four new Hunter x Hunter chapters are coming.
Furthermore, context clues suggest that these four stated chapters may actually be part of a new set of 10ish chapters, enough to fill a new tankoubon / volume of Hunter x Hunter manga.
If that proves accurate, Hunter x Hunter could present a classic case of feast or famine.
Let’s all hope that Hunter x Hunter receives a more deserving resolution.
