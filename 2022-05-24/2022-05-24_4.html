     Summary: Snap's shares are down about 84% from a 52-week high in September 2021 and are off more than 70% year to date.
The tumble comes after Snap issued a warning on Monday to investors saying it won't meet its own targets for revenue and adjusted earnings in the current quarter.
Snap shares plunged 41% on Tuesday, putting the company on pace for its worst day ever and dragging down other social media and digital ad company stocks.
Snap's warning is also impacting the ad tech industry.
Companies, including Snap, have been pressured into slowing hiring and cutting back costs in an effort to make up for losses.

     Snap Plunges, And There Goes Social Media’s Online Ad Biz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Investors knew that the world wasn’t clicking for online advertisers right now.
In a snap on Monday night, they grasped how dire the situation might be.
Nearly every major player in the sector reported a notable slowdown in advertising revenue growth during the recent first-quarter earnings season.
All but one actually missed Wall Street’s targets for that category as well.
Then, in a surprise announcement, Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, said in a filing Monday afternoon that revenue and adjusted pretax earnings for the second quarter will come in below the range the company projected barely a month ago.

     Summary: A woman stands in front of the logo of Snap Inc on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, NY, U.S. March 2, 2017.
REUTERS/Lucas JacksonMay 24 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) shares plunged more than 40% and sparked a sector-wide selloff on Tuesday after a profit warning from the Snapchat parent signaled tough times ahead for the once-booming digital ad industry.
Meta Platforms (FB.O), Pinterest (PINS.N), Twitter (TWTR.N) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) were all down between 7% and 24%.
Snap shares were trading at $13.3, lower than their 2017 IPO price of $17.
"There's a lot to deal with in the macro environment today," Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel said at a tech conference on Monday.

     Summary: The stock is on track for its largest one-day percentage decline on record.
Alphabet’s stock is on pace for its worst one-day percentage drop in more than two years.
Still, in Erickson’s view, Snap’s warning also signaled that “clearly more than just Europe is weak” on the macroeconomic front.
Erickson has a sector-perform rating on Snap’s stock and cut his price target by more than half, to $17 from $35.
He has an outperform rating on Snap shares but lowered his target price to $36 from $47.
