     Yoshihiro Togashi Apparently Confirms New Hunter x Hunter Chapters in the Works
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The acclaimed and imaginative manga Hunter x Hunter has not had any new chapters since 2018, and the series has been no stranger to hiatuses since publication began back in 1998.
Via Nibel, manga creator Yoshihiro Togashi has apparently opened a Twitter account and declared that at least four new Hunter x Hunter chapters are coming.
Furthermore, context clues suggest that these four stated chapters may actually be part of a new set of 10ish chapters, enough to fill a new tankoubon / volume of Hunter x Hunter manga.
If that proves accurate, Hunter x Hunter could present a classic case of feast or famine.
Let’s all hope that Hunter x Hunter receives a more deserving resolution.

     Hunter x Hunter Creator Joins Twitter, Reveals Manga’s Long Hiatus Is Ending
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hunter x Hunter, created by Yoshihiro Togashi, is about a boy named Gon and his journey as a hunter.
The Hunter x Hunter faithful, believing Gon and friend’s adventures would continue, went so far as to create a hiatus chart for Hunter x Hunter that tracks its appearances in Shonen Jump magazine against the days it’s been on hiatus.
AdvertisementIf you haven’t steeped yourself in Hunter x Hunter yet (which you should) but have watched the irreverent “Big Three” anime Naruto, know that Hunter x Hunter’s early adventures are basically Naruto’s first three story arcs (y’know, the good ones).
That’s because Hunter x Hunter served as inspiration for Masashi Kishimoto’s magnum opus.
Over the years, Togashi enlightened readers on his workflow while being bedridden for severe back issues in a series of Hunter x Hunter author’s notes.
