     Chris Murphy, having witnessed Sandy Hook’s pain, slams fellow senators: ‘Why are you here?’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Senator Chris Murphy was a young United States representative from Connecticut when he stood at a firehouse in 2012 with families from his district as they learned that their children, all first graders, had been shot dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
On Tuesday, nearly 10 years later, he stood on the Senate floor in anguish as yet another American city learned that children in elementary school had been gunned down.
“What are we doing?
What are we doing?” Mr. Murphy demanded of his colleagues, imploring them to take action on gun control.
“Why do you spend all this time running for the United States Senate — why do you go through all the hassle of getting this job, of putting yourself in a position of authority — if your answer is that as this slaughter increases, as our kids run for their lives, we do nothing?”
