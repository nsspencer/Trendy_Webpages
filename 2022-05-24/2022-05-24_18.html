     Mtn Dew's Fan-Favorite Tropical Punch Flavor Is Making a Comeback After 11 Years
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But with other artists, it's all about the deep cuts: What rarity will they pull out of the vaults tonight?
Using that analogy, Mtn Dew fans are the soda equivalents of Deadheads.
Today, we heard another announcement for Mtn Dew fans to get excited about: The brand has announced the return of a "classic" variety: Mtn Dew Typhoon — a "highly requested flavor" described as a "tropical punch twist" that hasn't been seen in over a decade.
Casual fans are not the target of Mtn Dew Typhon's return.
In fact, casual Dew drinkers won't even see Mtn Dew Typhoon on store shelves — it's only being sold in the Dew Store, and only Dew HQ members will be able to purchase it.
