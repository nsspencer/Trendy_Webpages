     Ricky Gervais’ Netflix comedy special draws criticism for graphic anti-trans remarks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ricky Gervais’ Netflix comedy special “SuperNature” has been available on the streamer for only a few hours, but it has already drawn criticism for a string of graphic and hurtful transphobic remarks.
Four minutes into the special, Gervais dives into material about the trans community seemingly calculated to draw controversy.
And now the old-fashioned ones say, ‘Oh, they want to use our toilets.’ ‘Why shouldn’t they use your toilets?’ ‘For ladies!’ ‘They are ladies — look at their pronouns!
I support all human rights, and trans rights are human rights.
Throughout the special, Gervais also bemoaned “cancel culture” for comedians and actors like Louis C.K., Liam Neeson and Hart — all of whom still have lucrative showbusiness careers.

     Ricky Gervais draws backlash for jokes about transgender people in new Netflix special
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —A week before the start of Pride Month, comedian Ricky Gervais is being criticized for his new stand-up special, in which he mocks transgender women and the debate around bathroom access.
From there, he clarifies: “The old-fashioned women, the ones with wombs.”He goes on to reference debates about bathroom access.
Lose the c**k.”Both Gervais and Netflix were met with backlash online within hours of the special’s release, with some calling out Gervais’ remarks for being transphobic and the streaming giant for giving them a platform.
Gervais has been described as an “equal-opportunity offender,” a comedian with a previous history of polarizing jokes.
Dave Chappelle has made jokes about transgender people in multiple Netflix specials, most recently in late 2021, when he made explicit jokes about the bodies of transgender women in his special “The Closer.”Multiple trans rights advocates, including some Netflix employees, and civil rights organizations at the time called on the company to take Chappelle’s special down.

I support all human rights, and trans rights are human rights.” He then adds, “Live your best life.

     Netflix Under Fire—Again—Over Trans Jokes, This Time By Ricky Gervais
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineSeven months after dozens of Netflix staffers walked out of work to protest a Dave Chappelle comedy special critics called transphobic, the streaming service immediately came under fire by releasing a special from comedian Ricky Gervais, who jokes about trans women.
Describing how Kevin Hart lost his Oscars hosting gig in 2018 due to resurfaced tweets, Gervais again brings up trans women, saying “the worst thing you can say today is, ‘Women don’t have penises,’ right?
We didn’t think we fucking had to!” In another part of the special, Gervais says he “support[s] trans rights.
I support all human rights, and trans rights are human rights,” and urges his audience to “live your best life” and “use your preferred pronouns,” before joking “but meet me halfway, ladies.
In a 2018 Netflix special Humanity, Gervais made remarks about Caitlyn Jenner, who is transgender.
