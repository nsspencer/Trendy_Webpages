     David Perdue Says Stacey Abrams ‘Demeaning Her Own Race’ Ahead of Georgia Primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Atlanta, Ga.) — Georgia Republican candidate David Perdue on Monday accused Stacey Abrams of “demeaning her own race” in Abrams’ recent criticism of Georgia’s quality of life for its residents.
Abrams is bidding to be the first Black woman to be a governor of an American state.
She’s without opposition in her own primary Tuesday, while Perdue is trying to knock off incumbent Gov.
1 place to live.”But Perdue, in an interview with conservative radio host John Fredericks and former Trump adviser Peter Navarro on Monday, recast those and earlier Abrams remarks from a racist perspective.
“When she told Black farmers, you don’t need to be on the farm, and when she told Black workers in hospitality and all this … she is demeaning her own race when it comes to that,” Perdue said.

     Summary: Former senator David Perdue is unlikely to win the Republican primary for Georgia governor taking place on Tuesday.
And if you guessed, “with substantive criticism on issues that affect all Georgians,” you wildly overestimated the Donald Trump–backed candidate!
At a campaign stop on Monday, Perdue asked supporters, “Did you all see what Stacey said this weekend?
We just need greatness to be in our governor’s office.”) Abrams was born in Wisconsin and moved to Georgia in high school, where she has lived for decades.

     Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp defeats David Perdue in a major repudiation of Trump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brian Kemp resoundingly defeated former Sen. David Perdue is challenging in a major blow to President Donald Trump's endorsement power — and the political potency of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state.
Trump then endorsed Perdue, who lost reelection to now-Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff in a 2021 runoff election, to face off against Kemp.
Perdue has also attacked the integrity of Georgia's elections and said he wouldn't have certified the 2020 election had he been governor.
Other Republicans who challenged Kemp include far-right activist Kandiss Taylor, human resources professional Catherine Davis, and political newcomer Tom Williams.
Kemp managed to win outright and avoid a runoff against Perdue.

     David Perdue Doubles Down on 'Racist' Stacey Abrams Remarks in TV Interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Georgia GOP gubernatorial primary candidate David Perdue has targeted Stacey Abrams with what critics branded as "racist" attacks, telling the Black Democratic challenger she should "go back" to where she came from.
Hey, she ain't from here, let her go back where she came from, she doesn't like it here," Perdue said.
Critics said it was clear Perdue was not just using what is a well-known racist epithet to suggest Abrams should return to Wisconsin, where she was born.
Despite the fact she had not referenced race, Perdue said Abrams was telling "Black Farmers you don't need to be on the farm" with her remarks.
"She should never be considered material for a governor of any state, much less our state where she hates to live," Perdue said.

     In racist remarks, Perdue says Abrams is 'demeaning her own race'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Former Sen. David Perdue lashed out at Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams on the eve of Georgia's primary elections with racist remarks accusing her of "demeaning her own race" in characterizing some of the state's challenges.
David Perdue, a Republican gubernatorial candidate for Georgia, speaks at a campaign event in Cumming on March 7.
He continued by citing remarks Abrams made in 2018.
In an interview Monday with MSNBC host Joy Reid, Abrams acknowledged her remarks over the weekend were "inartfully delivered" but said they were "well intended."
Asked to respond to Perdue's remark Monday about how Abrams has been "demeaning her race," Abrams seemed to brush it off, talking instead about what she described as failures by Republicans to provide health insurance and other benefits to Georgians.

     Summary: Stacey Abrams, a Black Democrat running for Georgia governor, declined on Tuesday to directly comment on Republican David Perdue saying she should "go back to where she came from."
"I will say this," Abrams told ABC News at Tuesday's press conference.
Let her go back to where she came from," Perdue, a former senator challenging Gov.
While Abrams did not address Perdue directly at Tuesday morning's press conference, she conceded that what she said last week about Georgia's problems was "inelegant."
Perdue on Monday also criticized comments Abrams made during her 2018 campaign for governor when she said she wanted to diversify the state's economy beyond agriculture and hospitality.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brian Kemp fails Tuesday, it will show that you don’t have to embrace Trumpian insurrectionism to compete in GOP primaries.
But the looming shaming of Perdue is important for another reason.
With Georgia voters going to the polls Tuesday, Perdue is ending his campaign with a fitting burst of abject self-debasement.
Trump is reportedly angry that his endorsement of Perdue has associated him with a losing campaign and is washing his hands of it.
Perdue has attacked Kemp for supporting the construction of an electric vehicle factory in rural Georgia.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brian Kemp defeated his Donald Trump-backed challenger David Perdue on Tuesday after a furious push by the former president to punish Kemp for not overturning the 2020 election results.
Kemp’s victory sets up another general election race against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who was unopposed in her primary.
Perdue was courted by Trump to enter the race as retribution for Kemp not going along with the former president’s effort to overturn his defeat in Georgia’s 2020 election.
And four years later I am going to prove he was the wrong choice for Georgia,” Abrams said earlier Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Republicans have raised the specter of her becoming governor to try to unify a party fractured by Trump’s attempts to unseat Kemp.
