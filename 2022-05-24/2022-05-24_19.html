     Cleveland’s Russo Brothers go full spy thriller in ‘The Gray Man’ trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Leading the charge is a psychopathic former colleague named Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans).
If the two-minute clip is any indication, the film looks to be full of thrilling action sequences, intense fight scenes, intriguing spy games and funny one-liners.
Joe Russo wrote the screenplay with Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who also worked with the Russo Brothers on two “Captain America” and two “Avengers” movies.
The film arrives at select theaters on July 15 and premieres on Netflix on July 22.

     The real star of The Gray Man’s first trailer is Chris Evans’ evil ‘trash stache’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In both the Mark Greaney book, The Gray Man, and Netflix’s forthcoming movie adaptation by the Russo Brothers, one of the CIA’s most highly-trained and valuable agents becomes its number one target after he unearths a dark truth about the agency.
The Gray Man’s first trailer introduces you to Court Gentry (Ryan Gosling) as he fights to stay alive with one of the world’s largest bounties looming over his head and a mustachioed psychopath hot on his heels.
Though Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans) and Gentry were once technically colleagues, the two men find themselves at odds in The Gray Man’s first trailer as Hansen’s tapped to lead the worldwide hunt for Gentry’s head.
That being said, Hansen isn’t the only professional killer hunting for Gentry, and being in a constant state of motion is seemingly going to be the key to his survival.
The Gray Man hits select theaters on July 15th, and Netflix on July 22nd.

     It’s Gosling vs. Evans in the ‘Gray Man’ trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The answer to their problems may be the Russo Brothers’ The Gray Man, which stars Ryan Gosling and a wonderfully mustachioed Chris Evans as CIA assassins hunting each other down.
Only time will tell, but you can get your first glimpse at it in this new trailer that the streamer dropped on Tuesday morning.
Take a look:Here’s a synopsis, which is actually some pretty fun copy:“‘The Gray Man’ is CIA operative Court Gentry (Ryan Gosling), a.k.a., Sierra Six.
He’ll need it.”The Gray Man will hit theaters on July 15 before arriving a week later (July 22, just in case you need the math spelled out for you, and we pretty much always do, so no shame) on Netflix.
Let’s end this on a really positive note: It’s great to see Billy Bob again!

     Here's the first trailer for Netflix's The Gray Man
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Netflix has released a full trailer for upcoming action movie The Gray Man, and it wisely plays right into its strengths.
Like, the movie is directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, the brothers behind Avengers: Endgame, so this trailer could just say that.
But if you must know the plot, Ryan Gosling is some kind of “gray man” spy guy and Chris Evans is some kind of assassin guy who is out to kill him.
Ana de Armas, reunited with Gosling after Blade Runner 2049 and Evans after Knives Out, is… some other person involved in the spy business.
What we do know is that this very expensive movie will be on Netflix on July 22.
