     Rangers Even Second-Round Series Against Hurricanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Andrew Copp had a goal and two assists, and Frank Vatrano and Adam Fox each had a goal and an assist as the New York Rangers beat the Carolina Hurricanes 4-1 in Game 4 Tuesday night, evening the second-round series.
In the series, New York won two at home after opening with two losses at Carolina.
About a minute into the Hurricanes’ advantage, the Rangers had a 2-on-1, short-handed chance but Raanta made a sprawling save on Zibanejad.
The Rangers were unhappy with a fight that broke out at the end of Game 3 on Sunday between Lindgren and Domi.
In this one, Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba delivered a hard hit on Domi along the side boards as the Hurricanes forward was falling to the ice.

     New York Rangers relish 'added nastiness' against Hurricanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Rangers winger Ryan Reaves had some regrets after Game 3 against the Carolina Hurricanes.
Not about the result, which was a 3-1 Rangers victory at Madison Square Garden that cut their series deficit to 2-1.
Meanwhile, Hurricanes defenseman Tony DeAngelo was trading words with the Rangers' bench, causing an irate coach Gerard Gallant to snap back.
In a brief few moments at the end of Game 3, the second-round series between the Rangers and Hurricanes became a series Reaves would love.
While the Hurricanes have sputtered on the power play on the road, going 1-for-19 in the playoffs, the Rangers don't want to tempt fate by taking irresponsible penalties.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)Tonight, the New York Rangers face another “almost must win” game.
If they are smart, the Rangers will come out hitting, but will keep the hits legal and hopefully throw the Hurricanes off their game.
One interesting element was the Rangers made some subtle changes in their power play strategy after going 0-4 in Game Two and it paid off.
With only one abbreviated power play in Game One, they didn’t have a chance to see the Hurricanes penalty kill until Game Two.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the major similarities between the Penguins and the Hurricanes, however, is that they’re both high-volume shooting clubs.
The two teams finished among the top 10 in the NHL in shots per game during the regular season, with the Penguins sixth (34.7) and the Hurricanes ninth (34.1).
The Rangers have had to play each team differently in order to combat their strengths, and they’ve done it rather well so far.
“Every series is different,” defenseman Justin Braun said after the Rangers’ optional practice on Monday ahead of Game 4 Tuesday night at the Garden.
The Rangers and Hurricanes battle for the puck.

     Tyler Motte adding key element to Rangers 4th line: ‘He’s been one of their best forwards’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Motte’s presence has also allowed Gallant to avoid using his top-six forwards so heavily on the penalty kill.
In the five games since Motte came back from an upper-body injury, the PK rotation has been Andrew Copp, Motte, Rooney and Mika Zibanejad, with an occasional shift for Chris Kreider and even fewer shifts for Ryan Strome.
“He was always the same kind of player,” said Andy Copp, Andrew’s father, who scouted Motte for the U.S. program.
Reaves doesn’t even lead the Rangers in hits this postseason; his 28 are tied for third, behind Trouba and Kreider.
“Hard-working little guy,” said an NHL scout who’s seen all the Rangers playoff games so far.
