     Summary: Though the final score was a Warriors loss, this was nothing short of a win for the second unit.
Luka Dončić and the rest of the Mavs' main players should have been able to sit back and rest in the fourth quarter.
"Even though we didn't come out with the win, those guys had to play for the rest of the game," Moody said.
In 10 fourth-quarter minutes, Moody scored eight points, hit both of his 3-point attempts, grabbed two rebounds and came away with two steals.
The Warriors didn't get the job done Tuesday night in their Game 4 loss.

     Summary: As you might have noticed, Golden State has made the man who penned that piece look funny in the light.
The Mavs are making more triples than Golden State, as we suggested here that they might.
It’s part of how Wiggins has logged 20.7 points, 7 rebounds and 3.7 assists in the series on stellar efficiency.
All told, Wiggins has been basically just as effective on offense against Dončić as Dončić has been against him.
Similarly, Beck has written on Golden State’s incredible on-court chemistry and the club’s one-of-a-kind comeback ability making a comeback.
