     Rain delays second half of Golden State Warriors-Dallas Mavericks game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS -- Golden State's Splash Brothers were trying not to get wet at the start of the second half Tuesday night as water leaked through the roof of the American Airlines Center, delaying Game 4 of the Western Conference finals between the Warriors and Mavericks by 16 minutes.
This was the second time water dripping through the American Airlines Center roof affected a Mavericks game.
It also delayed the start of a Timberwolves-Mavericks game by 15 minutes back on March 21.
The Mavericks led 62-47 at the half.
Once the game resumed, the Mavericks continued to build on their lead, jumping out to a 99-70 advantage by the end of the third quarter and going on to win 119-109.

I think our defense was amazing today," Luka said.
When asked how Dallas adjusted to Golden State's zone, Luka said, "It's different.
It will be tough for Dallas in Golden State, as the Warriors have been dominant on their home floor all season, but they are not ready to quit.
Despite the loss, Golden State has shown an incredible ability to bounce back this postseason, and will look to do so again on Thursday evening.

     Why Steve Kerr went back to Warriors starters late in Game 4 loss to Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the first three quarters of their Game 4 119-109 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night, the Warriors starters were about as ineffective as they could possibly be.
So Warriors coach Steve Kerr did what any coach would do, pulling his starters and putting in a bench unit aimed at soaking up minutes before moving on to the next game.
The unit of Jordan Poole, Damion Lee, Nemanja Bjelica, Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody played well.
The first question to Kerr from reporters after the game was about his decision not to stick with the guys that got the Warriors back in the game.
"Yeah, I mean, with about five minutes left, I think we cut it to 14 or so," Kerr said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Given the tragic events of the day in south-central Texas – 21 people murdered, 19 of them children – isn’t that only natural?
While they were half-scrambling about American Airlines Center, the Mavericks, who lead the NBA in postseason mileage, were accelerating without respite.
Four minutes into the second quarter, the Warriors were trailing by eight.
Defense that looked a lot like that which was played as the Warriors were slumping and skidding through January, February and March.
For the Warriors, this was that rare postseason loss that feels about as painless as possible.

Luka Doncic was not as his most efficient, but led the way with 30 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists.
They doubled up the Warriors from the outside, outscoring them by 30 points from 3-point land, which was too big of a margin to make up.
While he wasn't at his most efficient, he was doing everything for the Mavericks and finished with 30 points, 14 rebounds, nine assists, two steals and two blocks.
There are few players who can control a game like Doncic, and he was not going to let the Mavericks lose.

     Summary: As you might have noticed, Golden State has made the man who penned that piece look funny in the light.
The Mavs are making more triples than Golden State, as we suggested here that they might.
It’s part of how Wiggins has logged 20.7 points, 7 rebounds and 3.7 assists in the series on stellar efficiency.
All told, Wiggins has been basically just as effective on offense against Dončić as Dončić has been against him.
Similarly, Beck has written on Golden State’s incredible on-court chemistry and the club’s one-of-a-kind comeback ability making a comeback.
