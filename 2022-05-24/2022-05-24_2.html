Hamada testified that "Aquaman" was the highest grossing film ever for the company.

     Judge Denies Johnny Depp’s Motion To Strike Amber Heard’s $100 Million Defamation Counterclaim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The judge in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial rejected the actor’s effort to reject his $100 million counterclaim.
Heard’s counterclaim centers on statements made by an attorney for Depp, Adam Waldman, who claimed in a Daily Mail interview that the actresses’ allegations of domestic abuse were fabricated.
Depp’s attorney Benjamin Chew argued for their motion on Tuesday morning, just before Heard’s legal team rested their case.
The judge previously denied Heard’s motion to strike Depp’s case.
“As to actual malice, Mr. Waldman made the counterclaim statements after he met with his client,” the judge said.

     Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial: Warner Bros. Executive Says Concerns Over Casting Actress In ‘Aquaman’ Sequel Had To Do With Her Chemistry With Jason Momoa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actor Amber Heard speaks with her attorney Elaine Bredehoft in the courtroom at the Fairfax County Circuit Courthouse in Fairfax.
Johnny Depp’s legal team started their rebuttal testimony on Tuesday with the video deposition of Walter Hamada, the Warner Bros. executive who said that their concerns over casting Amber Heard in the Aquaman sequel had to do with her chemistry with Jason Momoa.
He did say that Momoa’s pay for the Aquaman sequel was renegotiated.
He also suggested that the size of Heard’s role was determined by the early development of the script in 2018.
On Monday, producer Kathryn Arnold, an expert witness for Heard, testified that Momoa and Wan advocated for the actress to get the role in the sequel.

     Johnny Depp Loses Bid to Dismiss Amber Heard’s Counterclaim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Virginia judge on Tuesday denied Johnny Depp’s motion to dismiss Amber Heard’s counterclaim, ruling that the issue should be decided by the jury.
Ben Rottenborn, Heard’s attorney, argued that Waldman was acting as Depp’s lawyer, and that Depp is therefore responsible for Waldman’s conduct.
Heard’s attorneys also made a similar motion to dismiss Depp’s underlying defamation suit after Depp’s team rested their case on May 3.
Azcarate denied that motion as well, meaning that the jury will have to decide both Depp’s suit and Heard’s counterclaim.
Depp’s team is set to present witnesses on Tuesday and Wednesday to rebut Heard’s counterclaim, and closing statements are scheduled for Friday.

     Amber Heard on trial: Johnny Depp's defamation case is radicalizing young men
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But this story is also being driven by right-wing media figures who don't give a single hoot about "Pirates of the Carribean."
On Tucker Carlson's popular Fox News show alone, the conspiracy theory was hyped on over 400 separate episodes.
Anti-feminism makes good bait to pull young men deeper into authoritarian — and even fascist — politics.
Polling demonstrates that a distressingly large number of young men long for old-fashioned gender roles.
And once those young men have bought onto one self-pitying right-wing conspiracy theory, they have been softened up to accept all the rest of them.

     Johnny Depp's Motion to Dismiss Amber Heard's $100M Defamation Countersuit Denied by Judge

     Summary: A motion by Johnny Depp's legal team to dismiss ex-wife Amber Heard's defamation countersuit was denied by the judge.
After Heard's team rested their defense in this case on Tuesday, Depp's side argued for the actress' countersuit to be tossed out.
"There's no evidence that Mr. Depp even saw the statements by Mr. Waldman until he was sued," said Chew.
Earlier in the trial, Heard's team tried to motion for Depp's case against her to be dismissed; Azcarate also denied that.
In August, however, Azcarate granted Depp the right to pursue his lawsuit, denying Heard's supplemental plea to dismiss the case.
