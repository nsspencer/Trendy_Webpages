     Jacob Trouba sets the tone as New York Rangers even series with Carolina Hurricanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — When asked if there would be any carryover from Game 3 into Game 4 following heated postgame exchanges between the Rangers and Hurricanes, Jacob Trouba brushed the question aside.
With a chance to square up Carolina forward Max Domi near center ice, Trouba unloaded a crushing blow that sent Madison Square Garden into a frenzy.
Frank Vatrano cashed in on the ensuing penalty, setting the course for the Rangers' most complete effort of the playoffs.
It was a tone-setting moment in their effort to even this second-round playoff series at two games apiece.

     Summary: Vin A. CherwooAssociated PressNew York — The New York Rangers got the kind of strong, all-around effort from the start they needed and stormed past the Carolina Hurricanes.
However, Copp scored from the right side with just under nine minutes remaining.
The Rangers pushed their lead to 3-0 with 3:12 left in the middle period as Lindgren fired a shot that Raanta stopped.

     Rangers Even Second-Round Series Against Hurricanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK (AP) — Andrew Copp had a goal and two assists, and Frank Vatrano and Adam Fox each had a goal and an assist as the New York Rangers beat the Carolina Hurricanes 4-1 in Game 4 Tuesday night, evening the second-round series.
In the series, New York won two at home after opening with two losses at Carolina.
About a minute into the Hurricanes’ advantage, the Rangers had a 2-on-1, short-handed chance but Raanta made a sprawling save on Zibanejad.
The Rangers were unhappy with a fight that broke out at the end of Game 3 on Sunday between Lindgren and Domi.
In this one, Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba delivered a hard hit on Domi along the side boards as the Hurricanes forward was falling to the ice.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)Tonight, the New York Rangers face another “almost must win” game.
If they are smart, the Rangers will come out hitting, but will keep the hits legal and hopefully throw the Hurricanes off their game.
One interesting element was the Rangers made some subtle changes in their power play strategy after going 0-4 in Game Two and it paid off.
With only one abbreviated power play in Game One, they didn’t have a chance to see the Hurricanes penalty kill until Game Two.

     New York Rangers relish 'added nastiness' against Hurricanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New York Rangers winger Ryan Reaves had some regrets after Game 3 against the Carolina Hurricanes.
Not about the result, which was a 3-1 Rangers victory at Madison Square Garden that cut their series deficit to 2-1.
Meanwhile, Hurricanes defenseman Tony DeAngelo was trading words with the Rangers' bench, causing an irate coach Gerard Gallant to snap back.
In a brief few moments at the end of Game 3, the second-round series between the Rangers and Hurricanes became a series Reaves would love.
While the Hurricanes have sputtered on the power play on the road, going 1-for-19 in the playoffs, the Rangers don't want to tempt fate by taking irresponsible penalties.
