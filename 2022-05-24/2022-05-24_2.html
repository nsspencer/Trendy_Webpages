     Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial: Warner Bros. Executive Says Concerns Over Casting Actress In ‘Aquaman’ Sequel Had To Do With Her Chemistry With Jason Momoa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actor Amber Heard speaks with her attorney Elaine Bredehoft in the courtroom at the Fairfax County Circuit Courthouse in Fairfax.
Johnny Depp’s legal team started their rebuttal testimony on Tuesday with the video deposition of Walter Hamada, the Warner Bros. executive who said that their concerns over casting Amber Heard in the Aquaman sequel had to do with her chemistry with Jason Momoa.
He did say that Momoa’s pay for the Aquaman sequel was renegotiated.
He also suggested that the size of Heard’s role was determined by the early development of the script in 2018.
On Monday, producer Kathryn Arnold, an expert witness for Heard, testified that Momoa and Wan advocated for the actress to get the role in the sequel.

     Judge Denies Johnny Depp’s Motion To Strike Amber Heard’s $100 Million Defamation Counterclaim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The judge in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial rejected the actor’s effort to reject his $100 million counterclaim.
Heard’s counterclaim centers on statements made by an attorney for Depp, Adam Waldman, who claimed in a Daily Mail interview that the actresses’ allegations of domestic abuse were fabricated.
Depp’s attorney Benjamin Chew argued for their motion on Tuesday morning, just before Heard’s legal team rested their case.
The judge previously denied Heard’s motion to strike Depp’s case.
“As to actual malice, Mr. Waldman made the counterclaim statements after he met with his client,” the judge said.

     Johnny Depp Loses Bid to Dismiss Amber Heard’s Counterclaim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Virginia judge on Tuesday denied Johnny Depp’s motion to dismiss Amber Heard’s counterclaim, ruling that the issue should be decided by the jury.
Ben Rottenborn, Heard’s attorney, argued that Waldman was acting as Depp’s lawyer, and that Depp is therefore responsible for Waldman’s conduct.
Heard’s attorneys also made a similar motion to dismiss Depp’s underlying defamation suit after Depp’s team rested their case on May 3.
Azcarate denied that motion as well, meaning that the jury will have to decide both Depp’s suit and Heard’s counterclaim.
Depp’s team is set to present witnesses on Tuesday and Wednesday to rebut Heard’s counterclaim, and closing statements are scheduled for Friday.

     Summary: But this story is also being driven by right-wing media figures who don't give a single hoot about "Pirates of the Carribean."
On Tucker Carlson's popular Fox News show alone, the conspiracy theory was hyped on over 400 separate episodes.
Anti-feminism makes good bait to pull young men deeper into authoritarian — and even fascist — politics.
Polling demonstrates that a distressingly large number of young men long for old-fashioned gender roles.
And once those young men have bought onto one self-pitying right-wing conspiracy theory, they have been softened up to accept all the rest of them.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EMBED &gt;More News Videos The Amber Heard and Johnny Depp trial May 23 has covered a witness' dispute of how the actor suffered an injury to his hand.
FALLS CHURCH, Va. -- Actor Amber Heard rested her case Tuesday in the civil suit between her and ex-husband Johnny Depp without calling Depp to the stand.Heard's lawyers had initially suggested they would call Depp as a witness, but ultimately opted against it.Depp is suing Heard for libel in Fairfax County Circuit Court over a December 2018 op-ed she wrote in The Washington Post describing herself as "a public figure representing domestic abuse."
His lawyers say he was defamed by the article even though it never mentioned his name.Also Tuesday, Judge Penney Azcarate rejected a motion from Depp's attorneys to toss out a $100 million counterclaim she filed against Depp.
She had already ruled Depp could be held responsible for statements made by his lawyer, a principle Depp's team disputes.Depp has denied he ever struck Heard, and says she was the abuser in the relationship.
Heard has testified about more than a dozen separate instances of physical abuse she says she suffered at Depp's hands.The trial is now in its sixth week.Both Depp and Heard have each testified extensively already about details of their toxic relationship.
