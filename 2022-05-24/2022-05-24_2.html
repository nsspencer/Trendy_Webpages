    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The #TimeToHunt has come and gone as the Florida Panthers have been swept in four games by the Tampa Bay Lightning in round two of the 2022 Stanley Cup Playoffs.
In their past seven series-clinching games, Andrei Vasilevskiy has allowed one goal total.
He is also now the all-time leader in playoff series-clinching shutouts.
That is the worst power-play percentage of any team to play more than seven playoff games.
As the Florida Panthers enter the off-season, here is a reminder of their draft picks over the next three seasons: 1st round: None.

     Summary: TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Jon Cooper had every reason to be confident the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning could keep their bid for a three-peat alive.
Up next is Tampa Bay’s sixth trip to the East finals in eight years, where they’ll face either the Carolina Hurricanes or New York Rangers.
… It’s been tremendous to watch what we’ve been through the last few years,” Maroon added, “and it’s unbelievable to be a part of it.”BACK TO THE ECF WE GO.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TAMPA — As the Florida Panthers exited the handshake line with the Tampa Bay Lightning, they found themselves in a very similar situation as the twice-defending Stanley Cup Champions were back in 2019.
After that series, Lightning coach Jon Cooper took stock of the situation.
The Lightning blocked 77 Panthers shots as Florida continued to struggle to generate high-danger chances throughout the series.
Stamkos only had four points (two goals) but did a lot of other things to keep the Panthers off balance.
“They play their way, we play our way, but I think what we’re learning is all of the little things they do to win hockey games,” Brunette said.

     Summary: The Lightning have become ingrained in Tampa Bay in a way that no other franchise has quite pulled off.
But there’s something special about the way the Lightning reinvented themselves after the heartache of the 2019 postseason collapse.
They went from a team that dazzled you with skill to a group that impressed you with heart.
And from the moment Brayden Point scored the overtime winner against the Maple Leafs, the Lightning have been a team reborn.

     Summary: Now, the Lightning can get some much-needed rest and hopefully get a little healthier heading into the Eastern Conference Final.
Here's three things we learned from a series-clinching win over the Panthers.
All that experience has created a team that simply knows how to win games in the postseason.
After the Lightning won Game 4, they added their name to that list.
