     Snap closes down 43%, its worst day ever, dragging other stocks with it
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Snap shares closed down 43% on Tuesday, marking its worst day ever and dragging down other social media and digital ad company stocks.
The tumble comes after Snap issued a warning on Monday to investors saying it won't meet its own targets for revenue and adjusted earnings in the current quarter.
"Since we issued guidance on April 21, 2022, the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated," the parent company of Snapchat said in an SEC filing.
Snap's shares are down about 84% from a 52-week high in September 2021 and are off more than 72% year to date.

     Oh Snap! Social media stocks lose billions after Snapchat parent warning
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: May 24 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) shares plunged more than 40% and sparked a sector-wide selloff on Tuesday after a profit warning from the Snapchat parent signaled tough times ahead for the once-booming digital ad industry.
Snap shares closed at $12.79, lower than their 2017 IPO price of $17.
Snap said on Monday it was expecting to miss quarterly revenue and profit targets set just a month earlier and would have to slow hiring and lower spending.
Valuations for social media stocks are coming back down to earth after the companies posted unprecedented growth last year when advertisers began to recover from the pandemic, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at ad agency GroupM.
"There's a resetting of expectations," he said, adding that while economic problems like inflation are partly hurting revenue, Snap and other platforms have also overestimated their ability to maintain break-neck growth.

     Social media stocks tumble as Snap crashes to fresh lows: Here’s what’s happening
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Snap’s shares plunged more than 40% today after the social media company warned it would miss its own revenue forecast yesterday—dragging down other social media stocks with it.
advertisementadvertisementThe stock price for Snapchat’s parent company fell below $14 a share in midday trading, a dramatic decline from its $80-plus share price last year.
Meta Platforms, parent company of Facebook, saw shares fall almost 9% on Tuesday while Twitter dropped 4%, Alphabet declined 6%, and Pinterest sank 22%.
DiMassimo agrees, saying that most of the advertisers on Snap are packaged goods, beauty, or fashion brands.
“Hand-wringing over prospects for a U.S. recession beginning in the next year or two has become increasingly fevered,” he wrote.
