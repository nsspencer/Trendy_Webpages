    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UVALDE, Texas — A gunman killed at least 18 children and a teacher on Tuesday in a rural Texas elementary school, officials said, in the deadliest American school shooting since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary a decade ago.
Mr. Chapa said his nephew was in the school when the shooting took place but was safe.
Adolfo Hernandez, a longtime Uvalde resident, said his nephew had been in a classroom near where the shooting took place.
He entered the elementary school with a handgun and possibly a rifle, the governor said.
The shooting took place just after 11:30 a.m. For much of the afternoon, as word spread, anguished parents were instructed by the district to stay away from the school.
