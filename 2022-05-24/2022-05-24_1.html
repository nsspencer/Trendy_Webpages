     Summary: Upon learning about the deadly school shooting, Snyder said his agency took action.
In Florida, it was the Parkland school shooting that prompted major safety changes in schools around the state, such as requiring school resource officers on every campus.
I’m glad it’s law enforcement and I’m glad we’re in the elementary schools," Snyder said.
We also have a behavioral health professional, a school counselor, and other support on all campuses all day, every day.
Local law enforcement leaders will also follow the investigation in Texas for lessons learned that can be applied at home.

     Gunman Kills 19 Students in Texas Elementary School
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UVALDE, Texas — A gunman killed at least 19 children and two adults on Tuesday in a rural Texas elementary school, a state police official said, in the deadliest American school shooting since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary a decade ago.
Mr. Chapa said his nephew was in the school when the shooting took place but was safe.
Adolfo Hernandez, a longtime Uvalde resident, said his nephew had been in a classroom near where the shooting took place.
He entered the elementary school with a handgun and possibly a rifle, the governor said.
The shooting took place just after 11:30 a.m. For much of the afternoon, as word spread, anguished parents were instructed by the district to stay away from the school.
