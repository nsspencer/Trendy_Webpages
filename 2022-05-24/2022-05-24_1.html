     Live Updates: ‘Dark Day’ as Gunman Kills 18 Children at Texas Elementary School
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As gun production has skyrocketed, the newly released data shows a shift in popularity from long guns used for hunting to handguns for personal protection.
The numbers released Tuesday revealed an industry on the rise, with annual domestic gun production increasing from 3.9 million in 2000 to 11.3 million in 2020.
The gun industry has long resisted the disclosure of some firearms data collected by the A.T.F.
The boom in gun production appears to have been partly driven by the expiration of the assault weapons ban in 2004.
Gun production increased across the board during that time.

     Mass shooting at Texas elementary school leaves 15 dead, horrifies nation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “President Biden has been briefed on the horrific news of the elementary school shooting in Texas and will continue to be briefed regularly as information becomes available,” Jean-Pierre said.
”Just days after a shooter walked into a grocery store to gun down African American patrons, we have another Sandy Hook on our hands.
Just under 600 students were enrolled at the elementary school, and the last day of the school year was set for Thursday.
Gun reform advocates and Democrats on Tuesday highlighted the years of legislative action since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., left 20 children and six adults dead.
From killings at a Black church in Charleston, S.C., to a high school in Parkland, Fla., the nation has seen more than 3,500 mass shootings since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012.
