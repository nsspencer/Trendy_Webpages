     Aquaman 2 Plot Spoilers Revealed at Johnny Depp v Amber Heard Trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom won't be released in theaters for nearly a year, but it's been at the center of many recent conversations surrounding the DCEU due to Amber Heard's defamation trial against Johnny Depp.
As the trial nears its final stages with Heard and Depp both taking the stand, various stories are coming to light regarding Heard's place in her next DC outing.
Aquaman 2 Plot Points Come Out in CourtDCKathryn Arnold, an entertainment industry consultant, took the stand at the defamation trial between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, revealing key plot points concerning Heard's role in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.
ADVERTISEMENTWith only a few more days remaining in this trial against Johnny Depp, Heard's status in Aquaman 2 will remain a mystery at least until the movie's promotional tour begins later this year.
After that, the actress behind Mera may possibly leave the franchise altogether, which could depend on the results of the trial as well.

     Jason Momoa and James Wan blocked efforts to cut Amber Heard out of Aquaman 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Johnny Depp/Amber Heard defamation trial continues to skulk its way across the seafloor of the online subconscious this week, occasionally vomiting up some industry factoid or moment of strangeness that inevitably rises to the surface to be fitfully dissected and perused.
Which was “significant,” in Arnold’s telling, most notably as it applied to Heard’s starring role in the Aquaman sub-franchise of Warner Bros. films.
As such, Warner Bros. told Heard she was functionally disinvited from FanDome, the company’s now-annual celebration of its brands and various film properties.
AdvertisementBeyond that, the studio reportedly pushed to have her removed from Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom outright, only being stopped by a united front from co-star Jason Momoa and director James Wan.
Per Arnold’s testimony, Wan and Momoa were both “ committed to her” and were “ adamant she was in the film.” Even so, Heard has testified that her part in the film was cut back, officially because of a supposed lack of chemistry with Momoa.

     DC Films Head Will Reportedly Deny Amber Heard's Aquaman 2 Claims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DC Films head Walter Hamada will reportedly deny Amber Heard's claims about her role being cut from Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.
Heard made her DC Extended Universe debut with a brief appearance in 2017's Justice League as Mera, an Atlantean who approaches Arthur Curry to discuss the nature of the Mother Boxes.
Heard's recent testimony mirrors Depp's, claiming that these legal issues have negatively impacted her career as an actor.
Since his tenure at DC Films began in 2018, Hamada has certainly been no stranger to controversy himself.

     How Jason Momoa saved Amber Heard’s ‘Aquaman’ job amid Depp trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Aquaman” himself, Jason Momoa, allegedly advocated for embattled Amber Heard to keep her role in the movie’s upcoming sequel.
Former producer and current entertainment industry consultant and expert Kathryn Arnold took the stand Monday as Heard’s witness during her ongoing trial against ex-husband Johnny Depp.
She said Heard’s red-wigged role was supposed to be her “star is born” moment but claimed the actress was almost cut from “Aquaman 2” because of issues with Johnny Depp, 58.
Amber Heard’s role in “Aquaman 2” was “radically reduced” due to her negative reputation because of Johnny Depp, witness Kathryn Arnold testified.
Since the trial started, more than 4 million Depp fans have flocked to sign a petition urging the actress to be dropped from the film altogether.

     Aquaman 2 Spoilers Revealed Through Amber Heard, Johnny Depp Trial Testimony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Johnny Depp/Amber Heard defamation trail heads towards a close this week, testimony heard on Monday in relation to Amber Heard’s upcoming appearance in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, and specifically how her role was allegedly reduced dramatically due to her ongoing legal issues with Depp, appears to have revealed spoilers for superhero movie.
In her testimony, Arnold explained how despite there being reported “chemistry” issues between Heard and Momoa, she had been led to believe that the original script featured a more prominent role for the actress.
She was featured predominantly throughout the script of Aquaman 2 when she first read it."
With the trial seemingly heading to some potentially pivotal testimonies in the next few days, Hamada’s statement could well be one that proves to be crucial in the trial.
A child of the 80s, he is the owner of almost 2000 books, more toys than his children, three Warner Bros. Store Gremlins and a production used Howard The Duck movie script.

     Amber Heard witness may have accidentally dropped Aquaman 2 spoilers at Johnny Depp trial
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warning: This article contains spoilers about Aquaman 2... maybe?
An expert witness appears to have let slip some spoilers from an early version of the Aquaman 2 script during testimony in Johnny Depp's defamation trial against Amber Heard.
Part of that damage came in the form of Heard nearly losing her part in Aquaman 2, according to the defense.
While she managed to keep the role, Heard previously testified she ended up appearing in a "very pared-down version" of the original story planned for her character Mera.
"So [her role] was radically reduced from what it was in the script and what she even trained for while she was preparing for the movie," Arnold added.

     Jason Momoa Helped Amber Heard Keep Aquaman Job, Expert Says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Cindy Ord/Getty Images for SiriusXMAccording to new testimony in Johnny Depp’s ongoing defamation trial against Amber Heard, audiences can apparently thank Jason Momoa for Heard’s reprised role in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.
According to Arnold, the sequence was cut and the role itself was “radically reduced” by the time Heard got to the set.
But Arnold countered this explanation, testifying that Heard was hired by Warner Bros. after doing a chemistry test with her co-star.
This included a petition to remove Heard from the Aquaman sequel, which has now garnered more than 4.3 million signatures.
Momoa has not publicly commented on Heard’s role in the sequel or his potential involvement in securing her said role.
