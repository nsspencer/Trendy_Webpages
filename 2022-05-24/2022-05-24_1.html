     Jason Momoa 'Aquaman' Salary Tripled, Amber Heard's Stalled Amid Court Woes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jason Momoa enjoyed a $12 million pay rise for reprising his role in the second Aquaman movie, while Amber Heard's $2 million paycheck for the role of Mera stayed the same for the sequel.
The witness for Heard testified that Game of Thrones star Momoa actually fought for his co-star to reprise her role in the Aquaman sequel, after the studio had expressed doubts about her return.
Arnold says that these "defamatory statements" prompted movie studios to be wary of working with Heard on new projects.
The expert witness went on to say that the only reason Heard reprised her role in Aquaman 2 was because Momoa and director James Wan were "adamant" about her return.
In court last week, Heard's agent Jessica Kovacevic testified that she was told her client's role was reduced because of her "lack of chemistry" with Momoa.

     Jason Momoa and James Wan blocked efforts to cut Amber Heard out of Aquaman 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Johnny Depp/Amber Heard defamation trial continues to skulk its way across the seafloor of the online subconscious this week, occasionally vomiting up some industry factoid or moment of strangeness that inevitably rises to the surface to be fitfully dissected and perused.
Which was “significant,” in Arnold’s telling, most notably as it applied to Heard’s starring role in the Aquaman sub-franchise of Warner Bros. films.
As such, Warner Bros. told Heard she was functionally disinvited from FanDome, the company’s now-annual celebration of its brands and various film properties.
AdvertisementBeyond that, the studio reportedly pushed to have her removed from Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom outright, only being stopped by a united front from co-star Jason Momoa and director James Wan.
Per Arnold’s testimony, Wan and Momoa were both “ committed to her” and were “ adamant she was in the film.” Even so, Heard has testified that her part in the film was cut back, officially because of a supposed lack of chemistry with Momoa.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom won't be released in theaters for nearly a year, but it's been at the center of many recent conversations surrounding the DCEU due to Amber Heard's defamation trial against Johnny Depp.
As the trial nears its final stages with Heard and Depp both taking the stand, various stories are coming to light regarding Heard's place in her next DC outing.
Aquaman 2 Plot Points Come Out in CourtDCKathryn Arnold, an entertainment industry consultant, took the stand at the defamation trial between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, revealing key plot points concerning Heard's role in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.
ADVERTISEMENTWith only a few more days remaining in this trial against Johnny Depp, Heard's status in Aquaman 2 will remain a mystery at least until the movie's promotional tour begins later this year.
After that, the actress behind Mera may possibly leave the franchise altogether, which could depend on the results of the trial as well.

     Aquaman 2 Spoilers Revealed Through Amber Heard, Johnny Depp Trial Testimony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Johnny Depp/Amber Heard defamation trail heads towards a close this week, testimony heard on Monday in relation to Amber Heard’s upcoming appearance in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, and specifically how her role was allegedly reduced dramatically due to her ongoing legal issues with Depp, appears to have revealed spoilers for superhero movie.
In her testimony, Arnold explained how despite there being reported “chemistry” issues between Heard and Momoa, she had been led to believe that the original script featured a more prominent role for the actress.
She was featured predominantly throughout the script of Aquaman 2 when she first read it."
With the trial seemingly heading to some potentially pivotal testimonies in the next few days, Hamada’s statement could well be one that proves to be crucial in the trial.
A child of the 80s, he is the owner of almost 2000 books, more toys than his children, three Warner Bros. Store Gremlins and a production used Howard The Duck movie script.

     Warner Bros. Considered Replacing Amber Heard in ‘Aquaman 2’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The president of DC Films testified Tuesday that the studio considered replacing Amber Heard for “Aquaman 2” out of concern that she lacked chemistry with star Jason Momoa.
Heard is seeking $100 million in a defamation counterclaim against Depp.
Heard was paid $1 million for the first “Aquaman,” and $2 million for the sequel.
However, Hamada testified that under his leadership at DC Films, he has made a point of not automatically renegotiating for sequels.
Heard has alleged that her role was “pared down” considerably over time, but Hamada testified it has remained static since the film was first developed in 2018.
