     Texas school shooting: How to help kids get through unspeakable horror
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The shocking shooting that left 14 children dead at a school in Texas is forcing parents and schools to once again confront how to talk to kids about violence.
With younger children, adults can explain all that adults do to keep them safe, such as locking doors and conducting emergency drills.
Parents also can and should tell their children that school is a safe place for them.
Discuss efforts of school and community leaders to provide safe schools.”“Upper middle school and high school students will have strong and varying opinions about the causes of violence in schools and society….
Emphasize the role that students have in maintaining safe schools by following school safety guidelines ... communicating any personal safety concerns to school administrators, and accessing support for emotional needs.

     Live Updates: 14 Students, 1 Teacher Dead in Texas School Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As gun production has skyrocketed, the newly released data shows a shift in popularity from long guns used for hunting to handguns for personal protection.
The numbers released Tuesday revealed an industry on the rise, with annual domestic gun production increasing from 3.9 million in 2000 to 11.3 million in 2020.
The gun industry has long resisted the disclosure of some firearms data collected by the A.T.F.
The boom in gun production appears to have been partly driven by the expiration of the assault weapons ban in 2004.
Gun production increased across the board during that time.
