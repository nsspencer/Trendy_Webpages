     Shooting at a Texas elementary school leaves 14 students and a teacher dead, governor says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Two days before the start of summer break, an 18-year-old man opened fire at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, killing 14 students and one teacher, Gov.
Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District police Chief Pete Arredondo said there also were multiple injuries from a "mass casualty incident" at Robb Elementary in Uvalde.
The shooter is from Uvalde, Abbott said.
"It's believed that he abandoned his vehicle and entered into the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde with a handgun and he may have also had a rifle, but that is not yet confirmed according to my most recent report.
He shot and killed, horrifically, incomprehensively, fourteen students and killed a teacher," he said.

     Texas governor: 15 killed in school shooting; gunman dead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: UVALDE, Texas – An 18-year-old gunman opened fire Tuesday at a Texas elementary school, killing 14 children, one teacher and injuring others, Gov.
The gunman entered Robb Elementary School in Uvalde with a handgun and possibly a rifle, Abbott said.
It was the deadliest school shooting in Texas history.
Robb Elementary School has an enrollment of just under 600 students, and Arredondo said it serves students in the second, third and fourth grade.
One year before the Santa Fe school shooting in 2018, a gunman at Texas church killed more than two dozen people during a Sunday service in the small town of Sutherland Springs.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, said 14 students and one teacher were shot and killed at an elementary school in Uvalde, in the south-west of the state, on Tuesday.
Abbott said the gunman, who he named as Salvador Ramos, an 18-year-old male from Uvalde, “shot and killed horrifically, incomprehensibly, 14 students and killed a teacher … the shooter, he himself is deceased and it is believed responding officers killed him”.
Abbott also referred to the gunman shooting his grandmother before entering the school.
An Uvalde police spokesperson did not confirm the numbers, identities or ages of the dead as given by the governor.
Ten years ago, 20 young children and six adults were killed at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.

     Live Updates: 14 Students, 1 Teacher Dead in Texas School Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As gun production has skyrocketed, the newly released data shows a shift in popularity from long guns used for hunting to handguns for personal protection.
The numbers released Tuesday revealed an industry on the rise, with annual domestic gun production increasing from 3.9 million in 2000 to 11.3 million in 2020.
The gun industry has long resisted the disclosure of some firearms data collected by the A.T.F.
The boom in gun production appears to have been partly driven by the expiration of the assault weapons ban in 2004.
Gun production increased across the board during that time.
