     On Somber Night, Mavericks’ Crucial Win Draws Muted Celebration
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was a skyscraper, the ball hurtling toward the rafters before plummeting to Earth.
It took one hard bounce off the court and then rattled through the hoop.
As they waded into Tuesday’s playoff game against the Golden State Warriors, the Mavericks had to be wondering whether they could make shots with any consistency.
While Doncic’s circus shot didn’t count, the degree of difficulty was outrageous.
And for a team on the ropes, it was a sign of good things to come.

     Summary: That was Luka Doncic's ultimate message when asked what changed in this game.
I think our defense was amazing today," Luka said.
When asked how Dallas adjusted to Golden State's zone, Luka said, "It's different.
