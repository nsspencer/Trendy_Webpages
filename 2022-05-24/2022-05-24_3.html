     Judge Denies Johnny Depp’s Motion To Strike Amber Heard’s $100 Million Defamation Counterclaim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The judge in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial rejected the actor’s effort to reject his $100 million counterclaim.
Heard’s counterclaim centers on statements made by an attorney for Depp, Adam Waldman, who claimed in a Daily Mail interview that the actresses’ allegations of domestic abuse were fabricated.
Depp’s attorney Benjamin Chew argued for their motion on Tuesday morning, just before Heard’s legal team rested their case.
The judge previously denied Heard’s motion to strike Depp’s case.
“As to actual malice, Mr. Waldman made the counterclaim statements after he met with his client,” the judge said.

     Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial: Warner Bros. Executive Says Concerns Over Casting Actress In ‘Aquaman’ Sequel Had To Do With Her Chemistry With Jason Momoa
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Actor Amber Heard speaks with her attorney Elaine Bredehoft in the courtroom at the Fairfax County Circuit Courthouse in Fairfax.
Johnny Depp’s legal team started their rebuttal testimony on Tuesday with the video deposition of Walter Hamada, the Warner Bros. executive who said that their concerns over casting Amber Heard in the Aquaman sequel had to do with her chemistry with Jason Momoa.
He did say that Momoa’s pay for the Aquaman sequel was renegotiated.
He also suggested that the size of Heard’s role was determined by the early development of the script in 2018.
On Monday, producer Kathryn Arnold, an expert witness for Heard, testified that Momoa and Wan advocated for the actress to get the role in the sequel.

     Summary: Depp’s attorneys also called a witness to challenge the idea that Depp was physically abusive to Heard: the surgeon David Kulber, who operated on Depp’s injured finger.
Asked if Depp could have grabbed someone with a splint on the finger, Kulber said Depp “could attempt to grab someone.
The supermodel was invited to testify after Heard said she hit Depp to protect her sister Whitney Henriquez during a dispute in the couple’s penthouse.
Heard testified that Henriquez was standing near a staircase, and immediately thought about rumors that Depp had pushed Moss down a flight of steps.
Likely to come up when attorneys question Moss is a story Depp once told about talking to Hunter S Thompson, the journalist and a hero of Depp’s.

     Johnny Depp Loses Bid to Dismiss Amber Heard’s Counterclaim
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A Virginia judge on Tuesday denied Johnny Depp’s motion to dismiss Amber Heard’s counterclaim, ruling that the issue should be decided by the jury.
Ben Rottenborn, Heard’s attorney, argued that Waldman was acting as Depp’s lawyer, and that Depp is therefore responsible for Waldman’s conduct.
Heard’s attorneys also made a similar motion to dismiss Depp’s underlying defamation suit after Depp’s team rested their case on May 3.
Azcarate denied that motion as well, meaning that the jury will have to decide both Depp’s suit and Heard’s counterclaim.
Depp’s team is set to present witnesses on Tuesday and Wednesday to rebut Heard’s counterclaim, and closing statements are scheduled for Friday.

     Amber Heard on trial: Johnny Depp's defamation case is radicalizing young men
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But this story is also being driven by right-wing media figures who don't give a single hoot about "Pirates of the Carribean."
On Tucker Carlson's popular Fox News show alone, the conspiracy theory was hyped on over 400 separate episodes.
Anti-feminism makes good bait to pull young men deeper into authoritarian — and even fascist — politics.
Polling demonstrates that a distressingly large number of young men long for old-fashioned gender roles.
And once those young men have bought onto one self-pitying right-wing conspiracy theory, they have been softened up to accept all the rest of them.

When asked directly if Heard’s role had been reduced, Hamada said that it was not.
Hamada did say that the original Aquaman worked well, and that test audiences responded well to Heard overall.
The original post continues below:Jason Momoa allegedly advocated for Amber Heard to keep her role as Mera in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.

     DC Films Head Says Amber Heard Was Almost Recast in ‘Aquaman’ Over Chemistry Issues, Not Johnny Depp Allegations

     Summary: Amber Heard was nearly replaced in the Aquaman and Justice League franchise — but not because of anything to do with her abuse allegations against Johnny Depp.
Rather, DC Films president Walter Hamada said Heard was almost dropped from the film because of chemistry concerns between her and co-star Jason Momoa.
Hamada testified at Depp and Heard’s ongoing defamation trial Tuesday, May 24, via video deposition.
Hamada testified that he had spoken with Aquaman producer Rob Cowan about the lack of chemistry between Heard and Mamoa as they shot the 2018 film.
You know it when you see it.”)Hamada noted that Heard’s performance in Aquaman was well-received at early test screenings, despite the chemistry issues.
