All Updates &amp; Contract ExplainedWhile testifying virtually during the Depp v. Heard trial, Hamada (via The Wrap) has confirmed that the studio considered recasting Heard for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amber Heard was almost booted from the Aquaman sequel.
Hamada said the studio’s concern was about the lack of chemistry between Heard and Jason Momoa, who stars as Aquaman.
The chemistry wasn’t there.
“I had to fight really hard to keep my career,” Heard testified May 17.
All that said, Hamada noted the original Aquaman still worked, and said that test audiences rated Heard highly.

     DC Films Head Says Amber Heard Was Almost Recast in ‘Aquaman’ Over Chemistry Issues, Not Johnny Depp Allegations
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amber Heard was nearly replaced in the Aquaman and Justice League franchise — but not because of anything to do with her abuse allegations against Johnny Depp.
Rather, DC Films president Walter Hamada said Heard was almost dropped from the film because of chemistry concerns between her and co-star Jason Momoa.
Hamada testified at Depp and Heard’s ongoing defamation trial Tuesday, May 24, via video deposition.
Hamada testified that he had spoken with Aquaman producer Rob Cowan about the lack of chemistry between Heard and Mamoa as they shot the 2018 film.
You know it when you see it.”)Hamada noted that Heard’s performance in Aquaman was well-received at early test screenings, despite the chemistry issues.

     Summary: Hamada — who has been president of DC Films since 2018 — alleged it was always intended for Heard to have a smaller role in the film franchise.
APAlthough Heard managed to keep her spot in the sequel, she alleged that her role was significantly reduced.
Meanwhile, since the trial started, more than 4 million Depp fans have flocked to sign a petition urging DC Films to drop Heard from “Aquaman 2” altogether.
The first “Aquaman” film — released in 2018 — was a box office smash, grossing more than $1 billion across the globe.

     Warner Bros. Considered Replacing Amber Heard in ‘Aquaman 2’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The president of DC Films testified Tuesday that the studio considered replacing Amber Heard for “Aquaman 2” out of concern that she lacked chemistry with star Jason Momoa.
Heard is seeking $100 million in a defamation counterclaim against Depp.
Heard was paid $1 million for the first “Aquaman,” and $2 million for the sequel.
However, Hamada testified that under his leadership at DC Films, he has made a point of not automatically renegotiating for sequels.
Heard has alleged that her role was “pared down” considerably over time, but Hamada testified it has remained static since the film was first developed in 2018.
