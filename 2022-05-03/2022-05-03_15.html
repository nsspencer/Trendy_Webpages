     Summary: Kourtney Kardashian is showing her fashion range at the 2022 Met Gala and subsequent after-party by going from a deconstructed menswear look to the tiniest minidress.
Following her debut on the Met Gala steps alongside her fiancé Travis Barker, Kourt stepped out for an after-party wearing a corseted houndstooth micro-minidress with a strapless, bustier-style neckline and visible boning.
Travis changed into black fringed pants and a white crop top with beading along the bottom.
A thick red leather belt (or tank top) peeked out from underneath his shirt, and he completed the look with black Oxfords and matching sunglasses.
Kourt's outfit for the main event included a cropped white button-down and an ivory-and-black wrapped tuxedo skirt.
