     Bad Bunny and Stormzy were authentic and exquisite in Burberry at the 2022 Met Gala
    </h2>

     Summary: Like Ariana DeBose and Simone Ashley, it was also the first time at the Met Gala for Bad Bunny and Stormzy.
Burberry and Riccardo Tisci also dressed Stormzy for his Met Gala premiere.
Those white lapels!
What could possibly be more elegant than those beautiful white lapels?!
In my opinion Stormzy is one of the best dressed at the Met Gala of all time.
