     Women Line Up Outside SCOTUS To Receive Their New Handmaid’s Tale Outfits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON, D.C.—With news coming out that the United States Supreme Court has overturned Roe v Wade, millions of women have accepted their fate and are lining up outside the SCOTUS building to receive their complimentary Handmaid's Tale uniforms.
"Well, I guess it has come to this—I'm a Handmaid now," said former pro-choice activist Pixie Stankbugg, draped head to toe in a red robe and wearing a white bonnet.
"We tried to stop it, but we're officially in the Handmaid's Tale now.
Now, where do I go to get impregnated by my assigned male Commander?"
The Biden Administration had promised to do everything it can to meet the demand for red robes and white bonnets.

     Summary: “The Handmaid’s Tale,” a hit TV show based on the bestselling book by prolific Canadian author Margaret Atwood, was filming this week at a former bowling alley on Riverside Drive.
Season 4 of “The Handmaid’s Tale” concluded last June.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Millions of Americans are reacting this morning after the reported overturning of the landmark case Roe v Wade.

The reported ruling has set social media alight with discussion, and it’s caused The Handmaid’s Tale to trend on Twitter.
One social media user wrote: “I liked The Handmaid’s Tale better when it was a work of fiction.”Another added: “Leaked draft Supreme Court decision would overturn Roe.
Handmaid’s Tale in 2022!”One more added: “Margaret Atwood has always said that she didn’t put anything in The Handmaid’s Tale that human beings hadn’t already done, in some time or place, in Western society, in the “Christian” tradition.

     Justice Alito's reasoning for overturning Roe v. Wade could lead to 'Handmaid's Tale'-style anti-feminist laws nationwide, says Rep. Jamie Raskin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Raskin said the scrapping of Roe v. Wade would be "an invitation" to overturn other laws.
Raskin said Alito's line of thinking could lead to "Handmaid's Tale type anti-feminist regulation."
Raskin was discussing the bombshell leak of the Supreme Court's draft majority opinion on Roe v. Wade during an interview with MSNBC host Rachel Maddow on Monday.
The overturning of Roe v. Wade could result in abortion becoming illegal in large swathes of the US.
Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are attempting to push a bill that could make Roe v. Wade codified in law.

     The Handmaid’s Tale: Social media users compare leaked Roe v Wade decision to Margaret Atwood novel
    </h2>

     Summary: Social media users are comparing leaked documents claiming that Roe v Wade will be overturned in the US to Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale.
As the news broke, Atwood’s book began trending on Twitter as social media users pointed out similarities between the dystopian republic of Gilead, where women are forced to bear children, and the modern day.
Handmaid’s Tale in 2022!”Actor Seth MacFarlane wrote: “As the staggeringly partisan, right wing-dominated SCOTUS nudges America closer to Handmaid’s Tale status, the importance of voting in EVERY election becomes even more obvious.
One would hope today’s news erases any further delusions that “both parties are pretty much the same.”“Tonight, Hulu is reclassifyin’ The Handmaid’s Tale as a documentary,” another tweet read.
Codify Roe v Wade, say f*** no to Handmaid’s Tale.”Another tweeted: “Dear SCOTUS: The Handmaid’s Tale is a work of fiction not an instruction manual.

     Is ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ a Pre-Documentary? The Surprisingly Interesting (and Scary) Financial Side of the Story

     Summary: We cover Social Security, traditional pensions, 401(k) plans, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and all of the various programs through which Congress has subsidized retirement saving.
Anyone who has been monitoring their retirement accounts recently, for example, has surely been experiencing agita as they have watched their balances shrink.
The Handmaid’s Financial RuinWhy is any of this relevant to “The Handmaid’s Tale”?
The law as currently written endows the president with surprisingly sweeping powers that he can invoke by declaring a state of emergency.
Even huge corporations like Disney have discovered to their dismay that displeasing the powers that be can lead to financial retaliation.
