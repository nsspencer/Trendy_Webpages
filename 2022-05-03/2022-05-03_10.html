     Sen. Collins: 'Completely inconsistent' that Gorsuch, Kavanaugh would support overturning Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Tuesday that a Supreme Court draft opinion circulated in February that suggests Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would be among the majority of conservative justices to support overturning Roe v. Wade went against what they said during their confirmation hearings.
At the time, Collins, who supports abortion rights, said his opinion about whether Roe v. Wade set a precedent would influence her decision about whether to back his nomination.
Collins told reporters afterward that Kavanaugh reassured her that the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling protecting a woman's right to an abortion is "settled law."
Collins announced her decision to back Kavanaugh in a floor speech before the Senate vote, repeatedly saying Kavanaugh had indicated multiple times that he wouldn't support reversing Roe v. Wade.
NBC News reported that when Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York met with Kavanaugh, he was unsatisfied with Kavanaugh's answers about Roe v. Wade, saying Kavanaugh refused to say whether the case or Planned Parenthood v. Casey had been correctly decided.

     Analysis: It looks like Susan Collins bet wrong on Brett Kavanaugh and Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Similarly, Collins told CNN in 2018 that she didn't believe Justice Neil Gorsuch, who she voted to confirm the previous year, would want to overturn Roe v. Wade.
"Obviously, we won't know each Justice's decision and reasoning until the Supreme Court officially announces its opinion in this case."
Asked by CNN if she was misled by Kavanaugh, Collins said: "My statement speaks for itself."

Collins may well be the only person shocked that Kavanaugh (and Gorsuch) look to be on the side of overturning Roe.

     Abortion Providers Supported Susan Collins After She Voted For Kavanaugh

     Summary: Then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh meets with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) in her office on Capitol Hill in August 2018.
(Photo by Zach Gibson/Getty Images) Getty ImagesS everal political action committees representing medical practitioners that perform abortions donated to Sen. Susan Collins after she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In explaining her support, Collins said that the judges expressed their respect for honoring legal precedents.
Personal decision-making by women and their doctors should not be replaced by political ideology.” ACOG’s PAC contributed $5,000, the most the law allows in a year, to Collins’ PAC in May 2021.
In September, the PAC for the 128,000-member American Association of Family Physicians contributed $1,000 to Collins’ PAC and also publicly opposed a Texas law that outlawed abortions after six weeks.

“Maine state law already prohibits abortion after viability and our laws should keep pace with modern, medical technology.

I know people are scared, so let me be clear — (Maine Senate Democrats) are committed to protecting Mainers’ right to abortion.

     Susan Collins: Leaked Roe opinion 'inconsistent' with previous statements by Kavanaugh, Gorsuch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After news broke Monday night that the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has drafted an opinion overturning the abortion protections in Roe V. Wade , prominent Maine politicians had a range of reactions.
The development put the greatest spotlight on U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican who has expressed support for abortion rights but voted to confirm two of the newest members of the court’s conservative wing: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement on Tuesday, Collins said that the leaked opinion was at odds with previous comments they had made.
Collins : “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office.
But it is only a *draft* opinion and ABORTION REMAINS LEGAL in this country.

     Senate’s Biggest Sucker Complains About Being Suckered
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At times, the Maine Republican seems to be either living in an alternate political universe or playing the role of a well-intentioned naïf on purpose.
In a statement reacting to the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, Collins expressed shock (or faux shock?)
that she had been misled by two conservative justices she voted to confirm, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.
(Collins did vote no on Donald Trump’s third Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, but she said her decision stemmed from the timing of the nomination.)
It’s still possible that Kavanaugh will shift his position before the actual decision is made public.
