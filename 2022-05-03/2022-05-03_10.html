There were plenty of couples at the 2022 Met Gala — including Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson — but none of them declared their love as blatantly as Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker did.
The couple hit the red carpet in not just matching outfits (Kardashian's ensemble was a "deconstructed" version of Barker's) but matching nail art as well.
Kim Truong worked on Kardashian, while Naomi Yasuda worked on Barker.
For Kardashian, Truong filed her nails into an almond shape and painted each finger black using The Gel Bottle Nail Polish in Jet Black ($19), except for her thumb.
