     Report: US reclassifies WNBA star Brittney Griner to be 'wrongfully detained' by Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Department of State says that Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner was wrongfully detained by the Russian government as efforts continue to get her back home, reports ESPN.com.
Griner was arrested and detained in February after the Russian Federal Customs Service said they found vape cartridges with cannabis oil cartridges in her carry-on luggage.
"The Department of State has determined that the Russian Federation has wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Brittney Griner.
With this determination, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens will lead the interagency team for securing Brittney Griner's release," a State Department official told ESPN.
The league continues to monitor the situation in Russia and support Griner as they will continue to pay her full salary.

     Summary: (AP) - The WNBA will honor Phoenix’s Brittney Griner with a floor decal and allow the Mercury to pay her without it counting against the team’s cap, the league announced Tuesday.
The All-Star center remains in Russia after being detained following her arrival at a Moscow airport on Feb. 17.
All 12 teams will have the decal on their home courts starting with the season opener Friday night.
“As we begin the 2022 season, we are keeping Brittney at the forefront of what we do through the game of basketball and in the community,” said WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert.
She helped the Mercury reach the WNBA Finals, where they lost to the Chicago Sky.

“The Department of State has determined that the Russian Federation has wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Brittney Griner,” a State Department official told ESPN in a statement Monday.
Previously, the player’s personal team kept a low profile and adhered to State Department advice so as to not jeopardize her release.
In March, Russian state media reported Griner’s detention had been extended to May 19.
The league also announced Tuesday it would keep Griner “at the forefront of what we do” with a floor decal during the 2022 season.

     Summary: None are superstars in their sport, as Brittney Griner is.
MaybeThe second argument as to why Brittney Griner isn’t getting the attention she should be is that she is LGBTQ.
Look to women's sportsUltimately, Brittney Griner has been forgotten because it’s too easy for us to do so.
That we have forgotten about Brittney Griner is not an oversight but rather the product of a design flaw in how we regard and reward our best athletes.
Which leads us to the most important consideration moving forward:If we don’t keep Brittney Griner as part of an ongoing conversation, who will?

     U.S. reclassifies WNBA star Brittney Griner as 'wrongfully detained' by Russia, sources say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The officials and other sources close to Griner's case declined to say what led to the shift or whether there have been any discussions about what it would take to secure her release.
Reached late Monday, a State Department official sent ESPN a statement, saying, "The Department of State has determined that the Russian Federation has wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Brittney Griner.
State Department officials notified appropriate congressional committees of the change Monday.
Griner's team became optimistic about her fate last week with the release of former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed, who had been held in Russia since 2019.
Griner, who plays during the WNBA offseason for a Russian team, was arrested in February at a Moscow-area airport while entering the country.
