     Chris Paul, Phoenix Suns beat Mavericks in Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX — The last time we saw Chris Paul in the playoffs, he was sending home the Pelicans on a perfect shooting night.
The Suns took Game 1 against the Mavs in their second-round series with a 121–114 win.
I just told coach I ain’t play much in the second quarter,” Paul said after the game.
At least in Game 1, Phoenix was blessed with a full rotation that contributed in several ways.
Also, with the way Dallas closed Game 1, it’s not a given Paul will have the same benefit of rest as the series progresses.

     Amick: Suns push forward as favorites but maintain ‘appropriate fear’ against feisty Mavs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was, in essence, just the kind of one-game-at-a-time approach that Suns coach Monty Williams has been preaching to his players of late.
It was, as Williams alluded to after the win over the Mavericks, all part of the “appropriate fear” mantra that is straight out of the Popovich playbook.
“We just talked about appropriate fear,” Williams said when I asked about his chosen message to his team entering this series.
Without the unnecessary fanfare, and with all the appropriate fear they can handle, they sure looked capable of it in the opener against Dallas.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, we’ll get into that and more in our five takeaways from a wire-to-wire Phoenix Suns victory that screamed intensity and physicality from the onset:1.
The Suns destroyed the Mavs on the boards 51-36 and pulled down 13 offensive rebounds.
Devin Booker, meanwhile, produced his 19th game in the postseason with 20 points or more and gave Doncic plenty of problems.
Led by Deandre Ayton’s (we’ll get to him later) team-high 25 points, Phoenix finished with six double-figures scorers.
In explaining Dallas’ myriad problems with communication in the first half, Doncic pretty much announced what the Mavs are expecting Wednesday for Game 2.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Welcome to ‘Inside the Suns’, your weekly deep down analysis of the current Phoenix Suns team.
GuarGuar: Given his playoff injury history it’s not very encouraging the minutes he was forced to play in round 1.
The other guys are going to need to step up in the early games of the series against the Mavs.
Q2 - What do the Suns need to concentrate most on to beat the Mavericks?
Dallas likes to play half court ball and the Suns need to push the pace to make them play faster than they like.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Mavericks phenom Luka Doncic had to be playing with some discomfort for most of Monday’s series opener against the Phoenix Suns.
Crowder got a flagrant 1 after this groin hit on Luka 😨 pic.twitter.com/3NK4OPX2f9 — Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) May 3, 2022While attempting a 3-point shot with less than nine minutes to go in the second quarter, Suns forward Jae Crowder accidentally caught Doncic where the sun don’t shine.
The 23-year-old Doncic remained on the floor for a few moments before walking away wincing in pain ... and nausea, possibly.
Crowder, who was called for a foul immediately, had the violation upgraded to a Flagrant-1 upon review from the officials.
