     Mavs vs. Suns: Luka Doncic Ready For Mikal Bridges Matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dallas Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic has a lot of respect for Phoenix Suns' Mikal Bridges, but is ready for the matchup.
There's been speculation about whether Bridges will end up matching up primarily on Luka Doncic or Jalen Brunson when the Suns face the Mavericks in the Western Conference Semifinals.
Given how important Doncic is to the Mavericks' offense, it is difficult to envision Bridges not guarding him primarily at some point.
“They have Bridges,” Doncic said.
Luka Doncic and Jalen Brunson found ways to attack, but the whole Mavericks' offense including Spencer Dinwiddie was clearly uncomfortable attacking deep on a drive.
