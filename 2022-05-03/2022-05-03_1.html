With that said, here are four bold predictions for the Mavs in Game 2 against the Suns.
4 bold predictions for the Mavericks in Game 2 vs Suns4.
However, it’s not completely impossible for the Mavs if they manage to make the necessary adjustments heading to Game 2.
If the Mavs manage to work on their errors come Game 2 then they can probably steal a game and score a narrow win over the Suns to even the series at 1 game apiece.

     Chris Paul, Phoenix Suns beat Mavericks in Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PHOENIX — The last time we saw Chris Paul in the playoffs, he was sending home the Pelicans on a perfect shooting night.
The Suns took Game 1 against the Mavs in their second-round series with a 121–114 win.
I just told coach I ain’t play much in the second quarter,” Paul said after the game.
At least in Game 1, Phoenix was blessed with a full rotation that contributed in several ways.
Also, with the way Dallas closed Game 1, it’s not a given Paul will have the same benefit of rest as the series progresses.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, we’ll get into that and more in our five takeaways from a wire-to-wire Phoenix Suns victory that screamed intensity and physicality from the onset:1.
The Suns destroyed the Mavs on the boards 51-36 and pulled down 13 offensive rebounds.
Devin Booker, meanwhile, produced his 19th game in the postseason with 20 points or more and gave Doncic plenty of problems.
Led by Deandre Ayton’s (we’ll get to him later) team-high 25 points, Phoenix finished with six double-figures scorers.
In explaining Dallas’ myriad problems with communication in the first half, Doncic pretty much announced what the Mavs are expecting Wednesday for Game 2.

     Inside Suns vs Mavericks - Thoughts on how this series will play out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Welcome to ‘Inside the Suns’, your weekly deep down analysis of the current Phoenix Suns team.
GuarGuar: Given his playoff injury history it’s not very encouraging the minutes he was forced to play in round 1.
The other guys are going to need to step up in the early games of the series against the Mavs.
Q2 - What do the Suns need to concentrate most on to beat the Mavericks?
Dallas likes to play half court ball and the Suns need to push the pace to make them play faster than they like.
