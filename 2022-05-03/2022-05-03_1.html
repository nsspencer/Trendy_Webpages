     The Celtics turn the tables on the Bucks in a 109-86 win to even their NBA Eastern Conference semifinal series

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They did just that in a 109-86 victory over the Bucks on Tuesday night, evening their NBA Eastern Conference semifinal series at 1-1.
After missing 32 of their franchise-record 50 three-point attempts, the Celtics went 20-for-43 from behind the arc.
And while the Celtics went nearly five minutes without a field goal in that Bucks run, that wasn’t going to continue throughout.
Holiday and Portis were the only other Bucks to score in the third quarter, netting four points apiece.
The Bucks also only made two of their 8 three-pointers and allowed 15 Celtics points off nine turnovers.

     Jaylen Brown, Celtics swing back vs. Bucks to even second-round series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When high profile trade chatter has come up (Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard) it’s been Jaylen Brown, not Jayson Tatum lumped into it.
Brown is still a Celtic—the second-longest tenured Celtic, in fact—and, boy, was Boston glad to have him on Tuesday.
“He set the tone and that was big for us.”There’s no sugar coating it: Boston was punked in Game 1.
Giannis Antetokounmpo was the only Bucks player to score more than 20 points—and he needed 27 shots to get his 28.
“We were pissed off in how we played last game,” Tatum said.

The Celtics shot 46.5%, the Bucks 16.7%.
The Celtics had that much confidence in their ability to whisk the ball around the perimeter enough to catch the Bucks off-guard.
