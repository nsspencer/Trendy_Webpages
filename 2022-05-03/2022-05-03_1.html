     Boston Celtics beat Milwaukee Bucks 109-86 in Game 2 to even series behind historic night from 3-point range

     Summary: Jayson Tatum added 29 points, including 19 in the second half to help the hosts close out the Bucks.
The Celtics guard went 9-of-10 from the field in the opening two quarters, including 5-of-5 from 3-point range on his way to his new career postseason best.
Boston kept control of the game throughout largely on the strength of their defense after their 3-point shooting slowed down in the second half.
The Celtics frustrated Giannis Antetokokunmpo into his second straight subpar shooting night, as the MVP candidate opened the game just 1-of-10 from the field.
With Milwaukee’s supporting cast struggling to shoot around him (20 percent from 3-point range), the Bucks failed to trim Boston’s lead below double digits in the second half despite Boston’s offense going cold for several stretches.

     Summary: When high profile trade chatter has come up (Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard) it’s been Jaylen Brown, not Jayson Tatum lumped into it.
Brown is still a Celtic—the second-longest tenured Celtic, in fact—and, boy, was Boston glad to have him on Tuesday.
“He set the tone and that was big for us.”There’s no sugar coating it: Boston was punked in Game 1.
Giannis Antetokounmpo was the only Bucks player to score more than 20 points—and he needed 27 shots to get his 28.
“We were pissed off in how we played last game,” Tatum said.
