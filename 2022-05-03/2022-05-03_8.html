     U.S. Government Says Brittney Griner Was ‘Wrongfully Detained’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More than two months after the W.N.B.A.
star Brittney Griner was accused of having drugs in her luggage and taken into custody in Russia, the U.S. State Department on Tuesday said that it had determined she was “wrongfully detained.”“The U.S. government will continue to provide appropriate consular support to Ms. Griner and her family,” a State Department official said in a statement, adding that an interagency team would work to have her released.
Griner, 31, has been held in Russia since February on drug charges that could carry a sentence of up to 10 years if she is convicted.
Russian customs officials accused Griner of carrying vape cartridges with hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow as she returned to Russia to resume playing for UMMC Yekaterinburg, a professional women’s basketball team, after a two-week break.
“Brittney has been detained for 75 days and our expectation is that the White House do whatever is necessary to bring her home,” Griner’s agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, said in a statement.

     Summary: The U.S. now says Russia is wrongfully detaining WNBA star Brittney GrinerEnlarge this image toggle caption Christian Petersen/Getty Images Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesThe Biden administration said on Tuesday that WNBA superstar Brittney Griner is being wrongfully detained by the Russian government — a shift in language that indicates the U.S. will work more aggressively to secure her release.
"The U.S. government will continue to undertake efforts to provide appropriate support to Ms. Griner," a State Department spokesperson said.
Griner, a center for the Phoenix Mercury, plays for the Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg in the offseason.
There are fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin could use Griner as a political prisoner to get something from the U.S.
In calling Griner wrongfully detained, the U.S. government will now negotiate for her return rather than wait for her case to wend its way through the Russian legal system, ESPN reported.

     US government says that Brittney Griner has been wrongfully detained in Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The State Department has now classified WNBA star Brittney Griner as wrongfully detained in Russia and her case is being handled by the office of the US Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs (SPEHA) Roger Carstens, a State Department official confirmed to CNN Tuesday.
The SPEHA office leads and coordinates the government's diplomatic efforts aimed at securing the release of Americans wrongfully detained abroad, and the shift to their office means more flexibility in efforts to negotiate her freedom, as they do not necessarily have to wait for Russian legal proceedings to play out.
Carstens and his team played a major role in securing the release of US citizen and Marine veteran Trevor Reed from Russia last week.
"When it comes to our efforts to free Americans, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Ambassador Carstens, he will go anywhere, he will talk to anyone if it means that we're able to come home with an American, to reunite that American with her or his family," State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday the decision to classify Griner as wrongfully detained was made "in coordination with the hostage negotiator [Carstens] and the State Department."
