     Summary: But for the Pittsburgh Penguins, as Carter put it on the eve of this postseason, he is “just another piece” of the leadership core.
“This is their team,” Carter said, referring to the Penguins triumvirate of Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang.
But that doesn’t mean his stature as a possible future Hall of Famer doesn’t carry weight in the Penguins dressing room.
“Especially lately, I think he’s really been really keeping us on track.
Coach Mike Sullivan, though, notes that even Crosby, Malkin and Letang look up to Carter.

     5 Things By the Numbers on Penguins’ Game 1: Sidney Crosby line absolutely dominant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: They had their most eye-popping advantages in the areas of scoring chances.
With Crosby, Guentzel and Rust on the ice together 5-on-5, the Penguins managed 30 scoring chances – and allowed only three.
Scoring chances (24-10), high-danger scoring chances (13-3) and expected goals for/against (3.91-0.87) tilted even more heavily toward the Penguins.
DeSmith was a perfect 10-for-10 on stopping high-danger scoring chances when the Rangers were at 5-on-5.
His possession metrics weren’t too good (opponents managed 36 attempted shots during the 29 ½ minutes Kapanen was on the ice 5-on-5), but at least Kapanen was making things happen offensively.

The Penguins came alive in the second period, putting New York on its toes thanks to an effective forecheck.

    </h2>

     Summary: NEW YORK — The Pittsburgh Penguins absorbed a lot of punishment from the New York Rangers during Game 1 of their opening-round playoff series Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.
Evgeni Malkin scored the game-winning goal at 5:58 of the third extra period, deflecting a John Marino shot past New York goalie Igor Shesterkin, who finished with 79 saves.
Adam Fox got it at 9:19, 21 seconds after Teddy Blueger was penalized for holding, when he threw a wrist shot past DeSmith from the high slot.
New York not only was faster than the Penguins during the early stages of play, but was far more aggressive.
The Rangers’ physicality not only allowed them to control the period, but could wear down the Penguins as the series progresses.
