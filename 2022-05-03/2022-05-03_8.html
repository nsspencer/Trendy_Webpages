     Villarreal vs Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp Provides Fitness Update
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has provided a fitness update ahead of the Reds' clash against Villarreal in the UEFA Champions League semi-final second leg.
On the fitness front, both Kostas Tsimikas and Curtis Jones returned to the matchday squad at St James' Park having been absent with illness previously.
Despite the unbridled positivity, Liverpool have been coping without Roberto Firmino in recent weeks as the Brazilian struggles with a foot problem.
There was mixed news on the 30-year-old's availability as Klopp spoke to the press ahead of the trip to eastern Spain (via Liverpoolfc.com).

     How Liverpool recovered against Villarreal to reach the Champions League final: Live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool became the first team to book their place in the Champions League final as they came from behind to beat Villarreal 3-2 away from home.
It meant the Reds went through to the Parisian final 5-2 on aggregate thanks to goals on the night from Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane.
Those three goals banished the home side’s hopes of a first Champions League final after Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin had initially wiped out Liverpool’s first-leg advantage.
Villarreal ended the game with 10 men after Etienne Capoue was sent off for being shown a second booking with less than five minutes left.
Jurgen Klopp’s side will now meet either Manchester City or Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes in Paris for the final on May 28.

     Summary: Liverpool overcame a rocky first half to beat Villarreal 3-2 on Tuesday night and book a spot in the Champions League final, winning the tie against their LaLiga opposition 5-2 on aggregate.
Liverpool scored a massive first goal in the 62nd minute, as Villarreal keeper Geronimo Rulli let Fabinho's powerful shot from a Mohamed Salah assist go through his legs.
Substitute Diaz then made his presence felt soon after, heading Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross down and through Rulli's legs again to level the match and give Liverpool a 4-2 aggregate lead they would not relinquish.
Liverpool player Fabinho celebrates after scoring a goal against Villarreal in the Champions League semifinals.

     Champions League Updates: Liverpool Beats Villarreal to Reach Final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The home fans held their scarves high above their heads, their pride masking the pain.
Villarreal came close on Tuesday, closer than anyone could really have imagined, to making the Champions League final.
At halftime, Unai Emery’s team was in control of the game and in control of the two-legged tie, and Liverpool — the overwhelming favorite — seemed to have had its confidence sapped and its rhythm broken.
Just when it seemed to be in its grasp, Villarreal’s dream was snatched away.
How much it hurt is, perhaps, the best measure of how close it came.
