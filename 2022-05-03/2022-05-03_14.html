The Braves and Mets will complete their doubleheader Tuesday evening with Kyle Wright facing Carlos Carrasco.
Braves’ Wright Has Reached Another LevelKyle Wright has offered a massive boost the Braves so far in this 2022 campaign, with a 3-0 record and a 1.13 ERA in 24 innings.
After some confusion regarding who would start each game of this doubleheader from the Mets, we now know for certain Carrasco gets game two.
The Mets get a much tougher matchup here vs Wright, and it’s quite possible we see this order looking less potent in game-two.
