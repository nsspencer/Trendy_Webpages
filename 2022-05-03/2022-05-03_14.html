    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Olivia Rodrigo has been vocal about how she‚Äôs a Twihard (And a woman of taste!

The Glossier ambassador followed up her Met Gala debut last year by wearing a sparkling purple Versace high-slit gown paired with violet platform heels.
Rodrigo told reporters it was all about opulence while working with birthday girl Donatella Versace.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the sweetest, and it‚Äôs actually her birthday today, which is incredible,‚Äù Rodrigo explained.

     Vanessa Hudgens Interviews Olivia Rodrigo At Met, &amp; ‚ÄòHigh School Musical‚Äô Fans Go Wild
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vanessa Hudgens and Olivia Rodrigo showed some mutual appreciation for each other on the red carpet of the Met Gala on Monday, May 2.
Vanessa, 33, interviewed the Sour singer, 19, and it was an extra sweet moment for High School Musical fans to see the two actresses, who each played Gabriella in two very different capacities for the original and the rebooted Disney+ series.
Olivia told the actress that they were ‚Äúsoul sisters,‚Äù and Vanessa seemed so excited for the shared role.
For those who may not remember, Vanessa originated the role of Gabriella in the original High School Musical trilogy, making her debut in the classic Disney Channel Original Movie in 2006.
In 2019, Olivia starred in the rebooted High School Musical: The Musical: The Series as Nini Salazar-Roberts, who plays Gabriella in a staged production of HSM.
