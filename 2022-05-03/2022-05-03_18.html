     Shawn Mendes Gives Off Major Disney Prince Vibes At 2022 Met Gala
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The stars hit the Red Carpet during the 2022 Met Gala on Monday (May 2), and many fans couldn't help but notice Shawn Mendes' strong resemblance to a Disney prince.
Mendes stepped out on the Red Carpet dressed in Tommy Hilfiger, wearing a navy blue and maroon overcoat, collar popped, on top of a matching navy blue double-breasted suit with black turtleneck and black leather heeled boots, per People.
The look drew comparisons to a range of pop culture faves, from The Little Mermaid's Prince Eric and Beauty and the Beast's Gaston to Harry Potter and Marvel's Doctor Strange.
Whatever comparisons fans noticed, the general consensus of the look was that they were "here for it."

     Fans think Shawn Mendes looked like a Disney prince or Doctor Strange in upcycled Met Gala outfit
    </h2>

     Summary: Fans think Shawn Mendes made a fairytale-inspired fashion statement on the red carpet at the 2022 Met Gala when he arrived in a Tommy Hilfiger outfit that drew comparisons to a Disney prince.
“Can we talk about how much Shawn Mendes looks like Prince Eric??
“Shawn Mendes is giving ‘Gaston from The Beauty and the Beast’ vibes,” one person tweeted, while another said: “Is Shawn Mendes channelling ultimate bad boy Gaston?”However, according to some fans, Mendes’ Tommy Hilfiger ensemble was more reminiscent of Marvel’s Doctor Strange, or Bridgerton’s Lord Anthony Bridgerton.
While fans were divided over which fictional character Mendes most closely resembled, others were simply appreciative of the Grammy Award nominee’s Met Gala look.
“Don’t try and tell me that Shawn Mendes didn’t slay at the Met Gala tonight because you are incredibly incorrect and he looked FINE,” one person wrote on Twitter.

Shawn showed up at the 2020 Met Gala looking incredibly dashing and so very Bridgerton in Tommy Hilfiger, but apparently Twitter decided en masse that he was channeling Gaston from Beauty and the Beast.
