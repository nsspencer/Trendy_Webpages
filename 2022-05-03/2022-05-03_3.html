     Summary: The U.S. now says Russia is wrongfully detaining WNBA star Brittney GrinerEnlarge this image toggle caption Christian Petersen/Getty Images Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesThe Biden administration said on Tuesday that WNBA superstar Brittney Griner is being wrongfully detained by the Russian government — a shift in language that indicates the U.S. will work more aggressively to secure her release.
"The U.S. government will continue to undertake efforts to provide appropriate support to Ms. Griner," a State Department spokesperson said.
Griner, a center for the Phoenix Mercury, plays for the Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg in the offseason.
There are fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin could use Griner as a political prisoner to get something from the U.S.
In calling Griner wrongfully detained, the U.S. government will now negotiate for her return rather than wait for her case to wend its way through the Russian legal system, ESPN reported.

     US government says that Brittney Griner has been wrongfully detained in Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The State Department has now classified WNBA player Brittney Griner as wrongfully detained in Russia and her case is being handled by the office of the US Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs (SPEHA) Roger Carstens, a State Department official confirmed to CNN Tuesday.
The SPEHA office leads and coordinates the government's diplomatic efforts aimed at securing the release of Americans wrongfully detained abroad, and the shift to their office means more flexibility in efforts to negotiate her freedom, as they do not necessarily have to wait for Russian legal proceedings to play out.
Carstens and his team played a major role in securing the release of US citizen and former Marine Trevor Reed from Russia last week.
"When it comes to our efforts to free Americans, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Ambassador Carstens, he will go anywhere, he will talk to anyone if it means that we're able to come home with an American, to reunite that American with her or his family," State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that the decision to classify Griner as wrongfully detained was made "in coordination with the hostage negotiator [Carstens] and the State Department."

     Brittney Griner Reclassified As ‘Wrongfully Detained,’ per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. government now considers WNBA star Brittney Griner to be “wrongfully detained” in Russia, according to a Tuesday morning report from ESPN’s T.J. Quinn.
“The Department of State has determined that the Russian Federation has wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Brittney Griner,” a State Department official told ESPN in a statement Monday.
Previously, the player’s personal team kept a low profile and adhered to State Department advice so as to not jeopardize her release.
In March, Russian state media reported Griner’s detention had been extended to May 19.
The league also announced Tuesday it would keep Griner “at the forefront of what we do” with a floor decal during the 2022 season.

AdvertisementAt the time of her arrest, Griner, 31, was returning to the Russian team, UMMC Ekaterinburg, for which she plays during the WNBA’s offseason.
It was unclear what prompted the State Department’s shift in how it characterized Griner’s case, news that was first reported Tuesday by ESPN.
The new designation of Griner’s case on the part of the State Department could also herald a renewed public push for her release.
“It has been 75 days that our friend, teammate, sister, Brittney Griner, has been wrongfully detained in Russia," Nneka Ogwumike, president of the WNBA’s union, tweeted Tuesday.
