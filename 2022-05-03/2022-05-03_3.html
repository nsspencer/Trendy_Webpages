     J.D. Vance’s Rise From ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ Author to Senate Nominee
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Before the 2016 election, J.D.
The conversion of Mr. Vance, an author and venture capitalist, from Trump skeptic to full-on Trump ally might fill a second memoir, a sequel to his best-selling “Hillbilly Elegy,” Mr. Vance’s story of growing up poor in Kentucky and Ohio.
When that book was published in 2016, it was devoured by the “coastal elites” he now rails against as a means for them to decode white working-class support for Mr. Trump.
Mr. Vance’s book pointed inward to explain the woes of his community: He blamed a personal “lack of agency” for drug abuse, welfare dependency and chaotic lives.
But as a politician, he has pointed the finger outward, at external enemies, just as Mr. Trump did.

Vance, who last month earned former President Donald Trump's late endorsement in Ohio's Republican Senate primary, has won the GOP contest, according to a race call from The Associated Press.
Vance started immediately climbing in polls after Trump's endorsement, overtaking Mandel, who was in his third U.S. Senate campaign, in the last few days.
Also notable was how Trump's endorsement of Vance seemingly had an impact on a candidate who had been more critical of the former president.

     Donald Trump-backed candidate JD Vance wins Ohio Senate Republican primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Author JD Vance won the Senate Republican primary in Ohio on Tuesday, securing a victory after receiving Donald Trump’s endorsement in the hotly contested race.
“They wanted to write a story that this campaign would be the death of Donald Trump’s America First agenda,” Vance said.
The Ohio race could prove crucial in determining control of the Senate, as Republicans look to retake the upper chamber this November.
Vance’s victory now provides another data point in how influential Trump’s endorsement remains among Republican primary voters, underscoring the former president’s firm grip on the party.
Several of the primary candidates in Ohio had openly campaigned for Trump’s endorsement, but Vance won him over, partly thanks to his performance in recent debates.

     J.D. Vance's Trump-like effect
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The big picture: Vance's victory deals a body blow to a small but noticeable resurgence of anti-Trump — or post-Trump — sentiment in the GOP.
Republican Trump critics staked their hopes on state senator Matt Dolan, who accused Trump of peddling "lies" about fraud in the 2020 election and blamed him for the January 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.
Vance’s key strategists were Andy Surabian, advising on national politics, and Jai Chabria steering the Ohio operation.
McConnell's stance has the enthusiastic support of virtually his entire GOP Senate conference.

     Summary: Trump called Vance to congratulate him on his win Tuesday night, according to a source familiar with the call.
"We need to unify to fight Tim Ryan," Vance said, referring to the Ohio congressman who won the Senate Democratic primary, CNN projected Tuesday night.
It's the party of working people all across the state of Ohio, and it needs to fight and it needs to win," Vance said.
The Vance win is likely to embolden Trump as he looks ahead to other opportunities in the midterm calendar.

     Summary: READ MORE: Ohio 2022 Primary Election ResultsVance had been behind in the polls before Trump waded into the race less than three weeks ago, endorsing the “Hillbilly Elegy” author and venture capitalist despite Vance’s history as a staunch Trump critic.
Vance will face Democrat Tim Ryan, the 10-term Democratic congressman who easily won his three-way primary Tuesday night.
Democrats, meanwhile, are banking the GOP — with Trump’s help — will elect candidates so extreme they prove unelectable come November.

Meanwhile, in Indiana, more than a dozen state House members are trying to hold off Republican primary challengers who want to push the Legislature further to the right.
