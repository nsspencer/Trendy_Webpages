     Phoenix Suns’ Cam Johnson gets 3rd in NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phoenix Suns wing Cam Johnson finished in third place for the 2021-22 NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, the league announced on Tuesday.
Johnson was a finalist along with Miami Heat guard Tyler Herro and Cleveland Cavaliers big man Kevin Love.
The Suns forward received one first-place vote, 27 second-place votes and 42 third-place votes for a grand total of 128 points.
Johnson’s third-place finish also marks the second Phoenix Sun to be named an NBA award finalist but not a winner after wing Mikal Bridges came in second place for the Defensive Player of the Year Award.
The last Phoenix player to bring home the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award was the Brazilian Blur Leandro Barbosa back in 2006-07 during the Seven Seconds or Less Suns era.

     Suns starters shine against Mavericks; Heat get a win against Joel Embiid-less Sixers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat secured wins in Game 1 of their respective second round playoff series: Miami defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 106-92 while the Suns beat the Dallas Mavericks 121-114.
"We've just got to get someone to join the party," Mavericks coach Jason Kidd told ESPN.
Doncic scored more points than the rest of the Mavs' starters who managed just 39 points between them.
Despite his individual performance, Phoenix led wire to wire, living up to their billing as series favorites.
Deandre Ayton scored 25 points and Devin Booker marked his return to the squad after three games sidelined by injury with 23 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.

     Summary: PHOENIX — The last time we saw Chris Paul in the playoffs, he was sending home the Pelicans on a perfect shooting night.
The Suns took Game 1 against the Mavs in their second-round series with a 121–114 win.
I just told coach I ain’t play much in the second quarter,” Paul said after the game.
At least in Game 1, Phoenix was blessed with a full rotation that contributed in several ways.
Also, with the way Dallas closed Game 1, it’s not a given Paul will have the same benefit of rest as the series progresses.

     Summary: The final result, a Phoenix Suns 121-114 win over the Dallas Mavericks to take a 1-0 series lead, will go down in the books as a clean, decisive victory.
After the JaVale dunk, the Mavericks went on a quick 5-0 run to cut the lead to 16 with a pair of clean shots sandwiching a Suns turnover.
It got the Suns just far enough off their spots to create confusion... and missed shots.
While Monty Williams talked about missed shots and Chris Paul chose to look on the bright side.
To win this series, the Suns will need be relentless.

     Summary: So, we’ll get into that and more in our five takeaways from a wire-to-wire Phoenix Suns victory that screamed intensity and physicality from the onset:1.
The Suns destroyed the Mavs on the boards 51-36 and pulled down 13 offensive rebounds.
Devin Booker, meanwhile, produced his 19th game in the postseason with 20 points or more and gave Doncic plenty of problems.
Led by Deandre Ayton’s (we’ll get to him later) team-high 25 points, Phoenix finished with six double-figures scorers.
In explaining Dallas’ myriad problems with communication in the first half, Doncic pretty much announced what the Mavs are expecting Wednesday for Game 2.
