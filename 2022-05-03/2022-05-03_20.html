     Met Gala 2022: Gwen Stefani Did Her Own Makeup for the Red Carpet — See Photo
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A beauty brand founder.
The "Hollaback Girl" singer walked the 2022 Met Gala red carpet on May 2, and she knew exactly how to stand out.
GXVE Beauty, which launched on March 3, consists of eye shadow quads, eyeliner pencils, brow pencils, and more.
Stefani oh-so-kindly wanted to give viewers a chance to see her products in action, teasing several new nude lipsticks joining the matte, satin, and liquid formats that have already dropped.
These new shades will come to Sephora on June 7, but we are dying to have them now after seeing Stefani on the red carpet.

“I had a lot of fun doing it today and it was stressful too but in a good way.
She said: "Vera called me to see if I wanted to come and be her date and of course I wanted to.
The blonde beauty admitted she enjoys getting ready for the event more than being at the gala.
"And the fantasy of that and talking with the designer and figuring out what the nails, the hair and make-up [are going to be.]"

     Gwen Stefani Did Her Own Makeup For the Met Gala
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As she arrived at the 2022 Met Gala on Monday evening, the singer and founder of the recently launched GXVE Beauty revealed she did her own makeup for fashion's biggest night.
Complementing her neon-green Vera Wang two-piece, Stefani went for her signature winged eyeliner in a bright blue, which she paired with a neutral lip.
While chatting with La La Anthony for Vogue's red carpet live stream, Stefani shared she had to take matters into her own hands when her new makeup artist had an emergency.
Luckily, Stefani had her own makeup brand at her fingertips to achieve the look.
Finally, Stefani mixed different GXVE lipstick shades to create her soft nude lip using products that have yet to launch.
