     Summary: Emma Stone walked onto the 2022 Met Gala red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a stunning white Louis Vuitton dress.
In fact, Stone donned this LWD stunner as an afterparty dress to her secret 2020 wedding to her husband Dave McCary.
Since photos from the nuptials were kept under wraps by the private couple, this was the first time we ever caught a glimpse of any of Stone's wedding looks.

     Emma Stone Won Most Sustainable at the Met Gala
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Photo: Theo Wargo/WireImageThe official theme of the 2022 Met Gala may have been “Gilded Glamour,” but it might as well have been reduce, reuse, upcycle.
The minidress, which features a feathered hem and lace straps, was “specifically designed for her wedding after-party,” per the official Louis Vuitton Instagram page.
Stone married writer-director Dave McCary in 2020, and until now, her wedding looks have been kept firmly under wraps.
Others wearing upcycled looks from the fashion house included Gemma Chan, Phoebe Dynevor, Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, and Cynthia Erivo.
I ask you, Hollywood, what’s more sustainable than wearing a piece of clothing more than once?
