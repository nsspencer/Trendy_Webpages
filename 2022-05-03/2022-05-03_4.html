    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rangers’ exuberance got the better of them at times.
In the second period, the Rangers picked up where they left off.

Less than 90 second later Crosby passed the puck in front of the net, where Jake Guentzel, the team’s leading goal scorer, tipped it into the net.
Seven minutes later, Crosby after he sliced through the top of the zone unguarded again found Guentzel again.
