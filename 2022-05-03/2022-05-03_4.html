     Kylie Jenner Explains Why She Wore a Wedding Dress to the Met Gala Despite Its ‚ÄòGilded Glamour‚Äô Theme

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kylie Jenner drew some criticism on social media for her Off-White bridal dress and backwards baseball cap veil she wore to last night‚Äôs ‚ÄúGilded Glamour‚Äù-themed Met Gala because of how far it strayed from the 1800s-inspired dress code.
But, Jenner wrote on Instagram, the bridal look was meant to honor the late Off-White designer Virgil Abloh more than play into the night‚Äôs theme.
‚ÄúVirgil and I were supposed to go to the Met together before it got postponed in 2020,‚Äù Jenner wrote.
We felt you tonight Virgil and love you forever ‚ôæ &amp; thank u to the entire @off____white team !
Scott did not attend the Met Gala with his partner; Jenner walked with her sister Khlo√© Kardashian, who wore a gold Moschino dress.
