     WNBA star Brittney Griner was 'wrongfully detained' by Russia in February, U.S. government says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. government believes that WNBA star Brittney Griner has been wrongfully detained by Russia, according to a report from ESPN.
Griner was accused of having vape cartridges containing the marijuana concentrate hashish oil in her luggage back in February and has not been allowed to leave Russia since.
"The Department of State has determined that the Russian Federation has wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Brittney Griner.
With this determination, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens will lead the interagency team for securing Brittney Griner's release," a State Department spokesperson told ESPN.
The shift to consider Griner wrongfully detained is a big step in the right directions towards bringing her home.

     Brittney Griner Reclassified As ‘Wrongfully Detained,’ per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. government now considers WNBA star Brittney Griner to be “wrongfully detained” in Russia, according to a Tuesday morning report from ESPN’s T.J. Quinn.
“The Department of State has determined that the Russian Federation has wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Brittney Griner,” a State Department official told ESPN in a statement Monday.
Previously, the player’s personal team kept a low profile and adhered to State Department advice so as to not jeopardize her release.
In March, Russian state media reported Griner’s detention had been extended to May 19.
The league also announced Tuesday it would keep Griner “at the forefront of what we do” with a floor decal during the 2022 season.

     Summary: Choose your plan ArrowRight “The Department of State has determined the Russian Federation has wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Brittney Griner,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement provided to The Washington Post.
AdvertisementAt the time of her arrest, Griner, 31, was returning to the Russian team, UMMC Ekaterinburg, for which she plays during the WNBA’s offseason.
It was unclear what prompted the State Department’s shift in how it characterized Griner’s case, news that was first reported Tuesday by ESPN.
The new designation of Griner’s case on the part of the State Department could also herald a renewed public push for her release.
“It has been 75 days that our friend, teammate, sister, Brittney Griner, has been wrongfully detained in Russia," Nneka Ogwumike, president of the WNBA’s union, tweeted Tuesday.

     Brittney Griner: US government says that WNBA player has been wrongfully detained in Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —The State Department has now classified WNBA player Brittney Griner as wrongfully detained in Russia and her case is being handled by the office of the US Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs (SPEHA) Roger Carstens, a State Department official confirmed to CNN Tuesday.
Kevin C. Cox/Getty ImagesOn Tuesday, the WNBA said it will honor Griner during the 2022 season with her initials (BG) and jersey number (42) along the sidelines of all 12 home courts.
“We continue to work on bringing Brittney home and are appreciative of the support the community has shown BG and her family during this extraordinarily challenging time.”Last season, Griner finished second in Most Valuable Player award voting.
The WNBA season starts Friday and Phoenix begins its season at home against the Las Vegas Aces.
Russian authorities did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on the State Department’s wrongfully detained classification in the Griner case.
