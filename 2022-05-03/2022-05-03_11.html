     Women Line Up Outside SCOTUS To Receive Their New Handmaid’s Tale Outfits
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON, D.C.—With news coming out that the United States Supreme Court has overturned Roe v Wade, millions of women have accepted their fate and are lining up outside the SCOTUS building to receive their complimentary Handmaid's Tale uniforms.
"Well, I guess it has come to this—I'm a Handmaid now," said former pro-choice activist Pixie Stankbugg, draped head to toe in a red robe and wearing a white bonnet.
"We tried to stop it, but we're officially in the Handmaid's Tale now.
Now, where do I go to get impregnated by my assigned male Commander?"
The Biden Administration had promised to do everything it can to meet the demand for red robes and white bonnets.

     Summary: “The Handmaid’s Tale,” a hit TV show based on the bestselling book by prolific Canadian author Margaret Atwood, was filming this week at a former bowling alley on Riverside Drive.
Season 4 of “The Handmaid’s Tale” concluded last June.

     The Handmaid’s Tale: Social media users compare leaked Roe v Wade decision to Margaret Atwood novel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Social media users are comparing leaked documents claiming that Roe v Wade will be overturned in the US to Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale.
As the news broke, Atwood’s book began trending on Twitter as social media users pointed out similarities between the dystopian republic of Gilead, where women are forced to bear children, and the modern day.
Handmaid’s Tale in 2022!”Actor Seth MacFarlane wrote: “As the staggeringly partisan, right wing-dominated SCOTUS nudges America closer to Handmaid’s Tale status, the importance of voting in EVERY election becomes even more obvious.
One would hope today’s news erases any further delusions that “both parties are pretty much the same.”“Tonight, Hulu is reclassifyin’ The Handmaid’s Tale as a documentary,” another tweet read.
Codify Roe v Wade, say f*** no to Handmaid’s Tale.”Another tweeted: “Dear SCOTUS: The Handmaid’s Tale is a work of fiction not an instruction manual.

     Summary: For decades, Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale has served not only as a liberal boogeyman but also a metonym for what America would be like if Roe v. Wade were overturned.
AdvertisementWe have been losing our right to accessible and safe abortions by inches for years.
In fantasy genre fiction, the specter of people who get pregnant being used primarily as living incubators is ever-present.
More commonly, transfiguration is involved—as in The Handmaid’s Tale, in which women who remember pre-theocratic America are consigned to lives as chattel.
In Bioware’s Dragon Age series, women captured by the Darkspawn are transformed into nightmarish “broodmothers” who continually birth new litters of monsters.
