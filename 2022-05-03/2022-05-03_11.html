     Hailey Bieber Showed up to a Met Gala After-Party in the Perfect Bra-and-Blazer Combo
    </h2>

     Summary: Hailey Bieber is a Saint Laurent gal through and through.
At the 2022 Met Gala, the Rhode Beauty founder wore a backless silk gown with feathers from the luxury fashion house to the red carpet and continued the Saint Laurent streak at an after-party.
In head-to-toe YSL, Bieber wore a three-button tuxedo jacket that was left open to reveal a rhinestone-encrusted logo chain bra and black leather short shorts.
GothamBecause wearing sunglasses outside is a celebrity must, the 25-year-old model wore slim ’90s-approved sunnies from an unreleased Saint Laurent collection.
Bieber opted for strappy sandals in a cherry-red glaze that stand out against the black ensemble.

“I remember I called [my mom] a few different times … crying, and I was like, ‘I just can’t do it.
“And I just remember she was so calm on the phone, and she was like, ‘It’s going to pass, you’re going to be fine and he’s going to be healthy and we’re here for you.
