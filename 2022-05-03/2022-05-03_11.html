     Summary: If candidates who endorse Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was stolen win control of state offices, Trump and his supporters could be poised to challenge the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election.
Control of the House and Senate will be decided as well, and history is against the Democrats.
The party of the sitting President has typically lost seats in Congress after his first two years in office.
If Democrats lose their narrow majority in the House or Senate, Biden’s ability to enact significant legislation will be blocked.

Mr. Ryan has long been considered the clear front-runner in his primary, but he has faced a formidable challenger to his left in Morgan Harper, a progressive lawyer.
At a candidate forum in Port Clinton on Sunday morning, three Republican Senate candidates — Mike Gibbons, a financier; Jane Timken, the former chairwoman of the Ohio Republican Party; and Matt Dolan, a state senator — chatted and shook hands with attendees.
Lisa and James Crescimano had already voted during the early voting period for two different candidates — she voted for Mr. Vance, and he voted for Mr. Dolan.
Mrs. Crescimano, 65, said she had been impressed with Mr. Vance when she heard him give a keynote speech as an author five years ago, long before Mr. Trump endorsed him.
