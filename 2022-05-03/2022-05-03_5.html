     Is Susan Collins Really Surprised the Supreme Court Is Overturning Roe v. Wade?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Collins comes from a very different time, now a long-dead world.
Cohen was a genuine moderate at a time when there were loads of moderates in both parties, even a sprinkling of actual liberals in the Republican Party.
It would all be forgivable, I suppose, except look who pays for Collins’s suspended-in-aspic belief system: poor women; women whose net worths aren’t a few million dollars, like Collins’s; and women who don’t live in New England, where the right to an abortion will likely remain legal.
Her land of make-believe maybe made her feel good, and it apparently helped her get reelected, but it is going to harm thousands of women.
And that is not forgivable.

     Analysis: It looks like Susan Collins bet wrong on Brett Kavanaugh and Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) As Sen. Susan Collins was preparing to cast a deciding vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in 2018, the Maine Republican insisted that he had told her directly that he considered Roe v. Wade settled law.
"My fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so we have far fewer 5-4 decisions and so that public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court is restored," she said in a floor speech announcing her decision.
In an interview with CNN the following year, Collins, who supports abortion rights, said that Kavanaugh "said under oath many times, as well as to me personally many times, that he considers Roe to be 'precedent upon precedent' because it had been reaffirmed in the Casey v. Planned Parenthood case."
Similarly, Collins told CNN in 2018 that she didn't believe Justice Neil Gorsuch, who she voted to confirm the previous year, would want to overturn Roe v. Wade.
"I had a very long discussion with Justice Gorsuch in my office and he pointed out to me that he is a co-author of a whole book on precedent," Collins said at the time.

     Senator Susan Collins says Supreme Court justices hid their Roe views
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican, suggested on Tuesday she felt misled by two of the conservative justices who signed onto the leaked draft opinion eliminating the Constitutional right to an abortion as she faced renewed scrutiny for her votes for them on Tuesday.
AdvertisementLeaving the Senate floor at a brisk pace, Collins fielded questions from reporters as she waited for an elevator to arrive.
Collins also said she believes Supreme Court confirmation hearings still serve a vital purpose, even if they did not help her divine Kavanaugh and Gorsuch’s true intentions.
(She did not vote for Kavanaugh.)
Her Democratic opponent sought to make Collins’ Kavanaugh vote a key issue in her 2020 reelection bid in Maine.

     Susan Collins reacts to leaked Supreme Court abortion decision
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said Tuesday morning that a leaked abortion decision contradicts what Supreme Court nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh told her about their views on the Roe v. Wade precedent.
Obviously, we won’t know each Justice’s decision and reasoning until the Supreme Court officially announces its opinion in this case,” Collins said Tuesday morning.
Janet Mills, who has signed into law several bills expanding access to abortion services, pledged late Monday night to defend abortion rights.
“At Planned Parenthood, we know that banning abortion does not take away people’s need to access abortion care.
Patients who need to access abortion should not face the shame and overwhelming hurdles that will come from this decision.

Key BackgroundPolitico published a purported draft opinion, obtained by an unnamed source, that appears to show a majority of the court agreeing to overturn Roe v. Wade.
The draft doesn’t show which justices concurred with Alito, but an anonymous source familiar with the decision told Politico Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Clarence Thomas, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh sided with Alito’s argument.

     Senate’s Biggest Sucker Complains About Being Suckered
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At times, the Maine Republican seems to be either living in an alternate political universe or playing the role of a well-intentioned naïf on purpose.
In a statement reacting to the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, Collins expressed shock (or faux shock?)
that she had been misled by two conservative justices she voted to confirm, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.
(Collins did vote no on Donald Trump’s third Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, but she said her decision stemmed from the timing of the nomination.)
It’s still possible that Kavanaugh will shift his position before the actual decision is made public.
