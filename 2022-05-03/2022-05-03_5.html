     Warriors' Steve Kerr rips Grizzlies as 'dirty' for early Game 2 antics

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steve Kerr knew Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Warriors and Memphis Grizzlies would be more physical than the first game, but what he saw in the opening quarter Tuesday night crossed the line, in his opinion.
"That wasn't physical," Kerr told TNT's Jared Greenberg before the start of the second quarter.

     Summary: Grizzlies wing Dillon Brooks was quickly knocked out of the game after committing a Flagrant 2 foul on Warriors guard Gary Payton II.
No, Green turned a single, ugly play into a much bigger deal when he gave fans in Memphis both middle fingers as he exited the court.
Green has some existing beef with Memphis fans after his Game 1 ejection.
The officials did throw Green out, but the Grizzlies still couldn't stop the Warriors from taking a 1-0 lead in the series.
The middle finger won't earn him a suspension, but a fine is almost certainly coming his way later in the week.

     Grizzlies Final Injury Report Against Warriors For Game 2
    </h2>

     Summary: The Memphis Grizzlies have finalized their injury report for Game 2 against the Golden State Warriros on Tuesday evening.
The Memphis Grizzlies are hosting the Golden State Warriors in Tennessee for Game 2 of their second-round playoff series.
For the game, the Grizzlies have finalized their injury report.
Game 2 will have huge implications, because the Warriors won the first game and Games 3 and 4 are in Golden State.
They had a chance for the sweep, but the Nuggets were able to win Game 4 and force a Game 5 (which the Warriros won).

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MEMPHIS, Tenn. — At the start of the playoffs, Jonathan Kuminga had to remind himself to be patient and know that his number would eventually be called.
Entering Game 2 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the Grizzlies Tuesday night, Kuminga has played in five of the Warriors’ six postseason games.
“It’s a lot of learning, it’s a lot going on at the same time… I’ve never played playoffs but I feel like I’m ready.
The Warriors previously said Iguodala’s injury is linked to the neck spasms that disabled Iguodala for Game 2 of the first-round series.
In three postseason games, he’s averaging 1.3 points, 2.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists, playing roughly 14 minutes off the bench.
