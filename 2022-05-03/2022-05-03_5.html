     Susan Collins Shocked That Brett Kavanaugh Would Ever Lie to a Woman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Senator Susan Collins, who had been assured by Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 that he considered Roe v. Wade “settled law,” said today that she was “shocked” that the Supreme Court Justice “would ever lie to a woman.”“When I met with Justice Kavanaugh before his confirmation hearings, he looked me in the eye and said that he considered Roe v. Wade the law of the land,” she said.
“Nothing in his confirmation hearings suggested that he would ever be less than trustworthy with a woman.”“As I watched his Senate testimony, I felt even more confident that he had told me the truth,” she added.
“His utter respect for a woman’s right to make decisions for herself came shining through.”In the aftermath of the leaked Supreme Court draft ruling and reports that Kavanaugh voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, however, Collins is reassessing her ability to tell whether someone is lying to her.
“My conduct in this matter has left me troubled and concerned,” she said.

     Collins calls draft Roe opinion 'completely inconsistent' with what Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said during hearings and meetings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) GOP Sen. Susan Collins said on Tuesday that a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade published by Politico was "completely inconsistent" with what Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh "said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office."
"If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office," Collins said in a statement.
"Obviously, we won't know each Justice's decision and reasoning until the Supreme Court officially announces its opinion in this case."
Asked if she was misled by Kavanaugh, Collins told CNN, "My statement speaks for itself."
On Monday, Politico reported it had obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.

     Summary: AdvertisementLeaving the Senate floor at a brisk pace, Collins fielded questions from reporters as she waited for an elevator to arrive.
Meanwhile, an aide stood between the elevator doors, urging her to move onto her next commitment.
Collins also said she believes Supreme Court confirmation hearings still serve a vital purpose, even if they did not help her divine Kavanaugh and Gorsuch’s true intentions.
(She did not vote for Kavanaugh.)
Her Democratic opponent sought to make Collins’ Kavanaugh vote a key issue in her 2020 reelection bid in Maine.

     Susan Collins reacts to leaked Supreme Court abortion decision
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said Tuesday morning that a leaked abortion decision contradicts what Supreme Court nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh told her about their views on the Roe v. Wade precedent.
Obviously, we won’t know each Justice’s decision and reasoning until the Supreme Court officially announces its opinion in this case,” Collins said Tuesday morning.
Janet Mills, who has signed into law several bills expanding access to abortion services, pledged late Monday night to defend abortion rights.
“At Planned Parenthood, we know that banning abortion does not take away people’s need to access abortion care.
Patients who need to access abortion should not face the shame and overwhelming hurdles that will come from this decision.

     Sen. Collins: 'Completely inconsistent' that Gorsuch, Kavanaugh would support overturning Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Tuesday that a Supreme Court draft opinion circulated in February that suggests Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would be among the majority of conservative justices to support overturning Roe v. Wade went against what they said during their confirmation hearings.
At the time, Collins, who supports abortion rights, said his opinion on whether Roe v. Wade sets a precedent would influence her decision on whether to back his nomination.
Collins told reporters after her conversation with him that Kavanaugh assured her that the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling protecting a woman's right to an abortion is "settled law."
The GOP senator announced her decision to back Kavanaugh in a floor speech ahead of the Senate vote, repeatedly stating that Kavanaugh had indicated multiple times that he wouldn't support reversing Roe v. Wade.
When then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., met with Kavanaugh, NBC News reported he was unsatisfied with the nominee's answers on Roe v. Wade, saying Kavanaugh refused to say whether that case or Planned Parenthood v. Casey were correctly decided.

The draft doesn’t show which justices concurred with Alito, but an anonymous source familiar with the decision told Politico Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Clarence Thomas, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh sided with Alito’s argument.

     Senate’s Biggest Sucker Complains About Being Suckered
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: At times, the Maine Republican seems to be either living in an alternate political universe or playing the role of a well-intentioned naïf on purpose.
In a statement reacting to the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, Collins expressed shock (or faux shock?)
that she had been misled by two conservative justices she voted to confirm, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.
(Collins did vote no on Donald Trump’s third Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, but she said her decision stemmed from the timing of the nomination.)
It’s still possible that Kavanaugh will shift his position before the actual decision is made public.

     Summary: After a leaked U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion late Monday reportedly showed that a majority of justices voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, past comments from Senator Susan Collins regarding Justice Brett Kavanaugh have resurfaced.
Resurfaced comments from Collins show that she said on several occasions that Kavanaugh told her he viewed Roe v. Wade as a "settled law" and deeply rooted precedent.
A video showing several clips of Collins' past comments on Kavanaugh's Roe v. Wade stance showed that in one 2018 appearance on CNN, she said that she does not believe he would overturn the decision.
In another clip included in the video, Collins said that Kavanaugh said he agreed with what Chief Justice John Roberts said at his own confirmation hearing about Roe v. Wade being "settled law."

     Susan Collins Is Surprised That Conservative Justices Are Doing What Everyone Knew They Would
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine who purports to support abortion, is surprised that the hard-right conservatives she voted onto the Supreme Court are willing to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Let me put it another way: It sounds like Gorsuch and Kavanaugh lied to Collins to win her vote, and Collins was gullible enough to believe them.
Gorsuch called it “settled law”—“in the sense that it is a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court.” (Tell me something I didn’t already know.)
Kavanaugh was even vaguer, calling it “settled as precedent.” Collins implied today that both justices made clear to her in meetings that they would not end Roe.
Now, the justices’ willingness to overturn settled law is all but confirmed.
