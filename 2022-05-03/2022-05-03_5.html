It’s important to remember that Phoenix dominated the boards in Game 1, grabbing 51 rebounds compared to 36 for the Mavericks.
“We’re gonna go small,” Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said Tuesday at practice.

     Summary: The final result, a Phoenix Suns 121-114 win over the Dallas Mavericks to take a 1-0 series lead, will go down in the books as a clean, decisive victory.
After the JaVale dunk, the Mavericks went on a quick 5-0 run to cut the lead to 16 with a pair of clean shots sandwiching a Suns turnover.
It got the Suns just far enough off their spots to create confusion... and missed shots.
While Monty Williams talked about missed shots and Chris Paul chose to look on the bright side.
To win this series, the Suns will need be relentless.
