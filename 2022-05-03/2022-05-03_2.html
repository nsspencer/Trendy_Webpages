    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Instead of Warriors forward Draymond Green, this time it was Grizzlies wing Dillon Brooks.
Officials announced that Brooks received a flagrant 2 foul and was ejected from the game.
Brooks’s ejection comes two days after Green was given a flagrant 2 foul and ejected from Game 1 against the Grizzlies.
He started the Warriors’ Game 1 win over Memphis and added eight points on four-of-five from the field.

     Summary: Steve Kerr knew Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Warriors and Memphis Grizzlies would be more physical than the first game, but what he saw in the opening quarter Tuesday night crossed the line, in his opinion.
"That wasn't physical," Kerr told TNT's Jared Greenberg before the start of the second quarter.

     Summary: May 4, 2022 at 1:08 AM EDTBOSTON — As the ball pinged around the floor, Grant Williams never got to touch it.
But that had him cracking up.
“It was actually hilarious because I think in that one possession, JB ball faked to me twice in the corner.
Ball faked me, took a dribble, ball faked me again, threw it to JT and JT threw it to Al and laid it up,” Williams said.
“I was like, ‘Huh, I’m kinda open.’ But I was like, ‘You know what, we got a layup, so I’m gonna get back on defense.’ So it was kind of cool.

     Warriors: Steph Curry applauds Jonathan Kuminga's ability to contribute during playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MEMPHIS, Tenn. — At the start of the playoffs, Jonathan Kuminga had to remind himself to be patient and know that his number would eventually be called.
Entering Game 2 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the Grizzlies Tuesday night, Kuminga has played in five of the Warriors’ six postseason games.
“It’s a lot of learning, it’s a lot going on at the same time… I’ve never played playoffs but I feel like I’m ready.
The Warriors previously said Iguodala’s injury is linked to the neck spasms that disabled Iguodala for Game 2 of the first-round series.
In three postseason games, he’s averaging 1.3 points, 2.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists, playing roughly 14 minutes off the bench.

     Summary: The Golden State Warriors second game against the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference Semifinals got off to an ominous start.
Jaren Jackson Jr. made a three on Memphis’ first possession, and Ja Morant followed suit on their second.
Brooks was ejected after being given a Flagrant 2 foul, and, more importantly, Payton would not return to the game after injuring his elbow.
Ja Morant — the primary reason that Payton is in the starting lineup — carved the Warriors apart all night.
A play after losing Payton, the Warriors temporarily lost Draymond Green, after he was hit in the face and needed stitches, which kept him out until the second quarter.

     Summary: The Memphis Grizzlies evened their second-round series with the Golden State Warriors at one game apiece with a 106-101 victory in Game 2 on Tuesday.
Ja-dropperIan Eagle has delivered just about every Ja pun you can think of during this series, so we might as well keep it going here.
The Warriors sagged way off him at the top, and he walked into 3s all night, making five of them.
If he starts hitting that shot on a consistent basis, which, with that kind of space isn't out of the question, he's going to be officially impossible to defend.
He's erratic game to game and very rarely hits the crazy shots anymore.
