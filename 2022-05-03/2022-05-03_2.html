     How Liverpool recovered against Villarreal to reach the Champions League final: Live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool became the first team to book their place in the Champions League final as they came from behind to beat Villarreal 3-2 away from home.
It meant the Reds went through to the Parisian final 5-2 on aggregate thanks to goals on the night from Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane.
Those three goals banished the home side’s hopes of a first Champions League final after Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin had initially wiped out Liverpool’s first-leg advantage.
Villarreal ended the game with 10 men after Etienne Capoue was sent off for being shown a second booking with less than five minutes left.
Jurgen Klopp’s side will now meet either Manchester City or Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes in Paris for the final on May 28.

     Summary: There’s plenty on the line when Villarreal meets Liverpool in Champions League play Tuesday, May 3.
Villarreal could be facing its last Champions League night in a while if it doesn’t pull off another upset on Tuesday against Liverpool.
That means only the Champions League title is likely to allow the club back into Europe’s top club competition next season.
Villarreal hasn’t lost a home match in more than five months, since a Spanish league loss to Barcelona last November.
Villarreal qualified for the Champions League this season by winning the second-tiered Europa League for its first significant title.

     Summary: Liverpool overcame a rocky first half to beat Villarreal 3-2 on Tuesday night and book a spot in the Champions League final, winning the tie against their LaLiga opposition 5-2 on aggregate.
Liverpool scored a massive first goal in the 62nd minute, as Villarreal keeper Geronimo Rulli let Fabinho's powerful shot from a Mohamed Salah assist go through his legs.
Substitute Diaz then made his presence felt soon after, heading Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross down and through Rulli's legs again to level the match and give Liverpool a 4-2 aggregate lead they would not relinquish.

     Liverpool Sweats, Then Celebrates Its Return to the Champions League Final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool has reached its third Champions League final in five years, but it was a rather more stressful affair in the second leg than it had appeared it might be.
But it still seemed an extremely small chance and that, perhaps, lulled Liverpool into a false sense of security.
After all, every Premier League match until the end of the season is effectively a final given the neck-and-neck nature of its tussle with Manchester City.
Liverpool, having overcome a surprising wobble, is in its third final of the season.
The League Cup is already won, the FA Cup is next up and the Premier League title is hanging in the balance.

     Liverpool reaches Champions League final after being rocked by Villarreal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool's Luis Diaz (second right) celebrates after scoring his side's second goal during the Champions League semifinal, second leg against Villarreal.
CNN —Liverpool’s pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple remains intact after a spectacular second-half comeback saw the Reds overcome a huge scare against Villarreal in the Champions League semifinal on Tuesday.
Three goals in rapid succession from Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane rocketed Liverpool to a 3-2 victory (5-2 on aggregate) and a third Champions League final in just five years, though the scoreline – quite literally – told only half the story.
Early goals from Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin sent the “Yellow Submarine” – affectionately nicknamed due to their luminescent yellow kit – into uncharted waters, threatening to sink Liverpool’s hopes of becoming the first side to win the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup in the same campaign.
I am always honest and focus on the Champions League and Premier League.

After all, Villarreal are a team that pay their squad only slightly more than Liverpool gave Porto for Luis Diaz in January.
West Ham had the chances to swing the first leg of their semifinal against Eintracht Frankfurt but travel to Germany 2-1 down with work to do.
