     Report: US reclassifies WNBA star Brittney Griner to be 'wrongfully detained' by Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. Department of State says that Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner was wrongfully detained by the Russian government as efforts continue to get her back home, reports ESPN.com.
Griner was arrested and detained in February after the Russian Federal Customs Service said they found vape cartridges with cannabis oil cartridges in her carry-on luggage.
"The Department of State has determined that the Russian Federation has wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Brittney Griner.
With this determination, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens will lead the interagency team for securing Brittney Griner's release," a State Department official told ESPN.
The league continues to monitor the situation in Russia and support Griner as they will continue to pay her full salary.

     US State Department now classifies WNBA player Brittney Griner as 'wrongfully detained' in Russia
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) The State Department has now classified WNBA player Brittney Griner as wrongfully detained in Russia and her case is now being handled by the office of the US Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs (SPEHA) Roger Carstens, a State Department official confirmed to CNN.
The SPEHA office leads and coordinates the government's diplomatic efforts aimed at securing the release of Americans wrongfully detained abroad.
They played a major role in securing the release of US citizen and former Marine Trevor Reed from Russia last week.
"When it comes to our efforts to free Americans, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Ambassador Carstens, he will go anywhere, he will talk to anyone if it means that we're able to come home with an American, to reunite that American with her or his family," State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday.
She plays for Russian powerhouse UMMC Ekaterinburg during the WNBA offseason.

     Brittney Griner Reclassified As ‘Wrongfully Detained,’ per Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The U.S. government now considers WNBA star Brittney Griner to be “wrongfully detained” in Russia, according to a Tuesday morning report from ESPN’s T.J. Quinn.
“The Department of State has determined that the Russian Federation has wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Brittney Griner,” a State Department official told ESPN in a statement Monday.
Previously, the player’s personal team kept a low profile and adhered to State Department advice so as to not jeopardize her release.
In March, Russian state media reported Griner’s detention had been extended to May 19.
The league also announced Tuesday it would keep Griner “at the forefront of what we do” with a floor decal during the 2022 season.

     Summary: None are superstars in their sport, as Brittney Griner is.
MaybeThe second argument as to why Brittney Griner isn’t getting the attention she should be is that she is LGBTQ.
Look to women's sportsUltimately, Brittney Griner has been forgotten because it’s too easy for us to do so.
That we have forgotten about Brittney Griner is not an oversight but rather the product of a design flaw in how we regard and reward our best athletes.
Which leads us to the most important consideration moving forward:If we don’t keep Brittney Griner as part of an ongoing conversation, who will?

     US officials: Brittney Griner considered wrongfully detained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration has determined that WNBA star Brittney Griner is being wrongfully detained in Russia, meaning the United States will more aggressively work to secure her release even as the legal case against her plays out, two U.S. officials said Tuesday.
Griner was detained at an airport in February after Russian authorities said a search of her bag revealed vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis.
Since then, U.S. officials had stopped short of classifying the Phoenix Mercury player as wrongfully detained and said instead that their focus was on ensuring that she had access in jail to American consular affairs officials.
The president of the WNBA players’ union, Nneka Ogwumike, noted in a separate statement that “it has been 75 days that our friend, teammate, sister, Brittney Griner, has been wrongfully detained in Russia.”“It is time for her to come home,” Ogwumike added.
ESPN first reported the classification in Griner’s case.
