     Summary: Kendall Jenner Gets Dragged For Her Eyebrows At The Met GalaThe Kardashians and Jenners sure made a splash at the 2022 Met Gala.
Fans who weren't buzzing about the reality star's sheer top were busy commenting about her eyebrows, or lack thereof, for the evening (via Page Six).
Apparently, Jenner bleached her brows, a choice some people over on Twitter couldn't quite get behind.
Some Twitter users were outright mean about the brow switchup, with one person commenting, "Okay, this is applaudable.
But most fans just had a little fun with the new look.

     Kendall Jenner Wore Lingerie to the Met Gala After-Party
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kendall Jenner looked pretty incredible at the 2022 Met Gala last night in a custom Prada skirt that took over the entire red carpet, and if you’re wondering how she could possibly top that look at the after-party, we have one word for you: lingerie.
Kendall stepped out post–Met Gala for a party at Zero Bond in what looks to be a vintage-inspired bra and underwear set, which she paired with a lace slip skirt and matching cami.
I’ll just be here proudly wearing my FOMO.

     Summary: Oh, that tricky Kendall Jenner!
While walking the 2022 Met Gala red carpet in a Prada two-piece, the model appeared nearly browless, and this seemed to be the result of bleach.
In addition to letting her eyebrows be visible, Jenner wore lingerie by Miu Miu: A matching satin bra and panty set, somewhat covered by a black lace tank, and a black lace skirt.
NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 02: Kendall Jenner attends an after party for the 2022 Met Gala Celebrating "In America: An Anthology of Fashion" at Zero Bond on May 02, 2022 in New York City.

     Summary: Some celebs showed up to the 2022 Met Gala looking, well, like they were going to prom.
We’re sorry but the Met Gala is when you bring your A-game with eye-catching hair, makeup and outfit made to be talked about for days.
Kendall Jenner achieved just that with only bleached eyebrows and a custom Prada gown.
Makeup artist Mary Phillips is responsible for Jenner’s Met Gala glam, and she used Kylie Skin and Kylie Cosmetics products, of course.
For her eyes, Phillips used Kylie Cosmetics The Bronze Palette — which isn’t out yet!
