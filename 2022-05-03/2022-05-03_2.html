     Liverpool’s Dream Delivered, Only After Villarreal’s Is Dashed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Villarreal’s bench emptied onto the field, coaches and substitutes and sundry assistants all scarcely able to believe what they were seeing.
At that moment, tied at 2-2 halfway through the second leg, Villarreal’s players stood within touching distance.
Villarreal would be the smallest town, by some distance, to send a team to the biggest game in soccer.
Villarreal, in the space of 45 minutes, had traveled all the way along it.
Five minutes later, Díaz had scored, drifting in to head a cross under Rulli.

     Liverpool eliminate Villarreal, advance to Champions League final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The clock struck midnight on Villarreal's Cinderella run through the 2021-22 UEFA Champions League, as the Spanish side was eliminated by Liverpool following the second leg of their semi-final.
However, the balance of power shifted firmly to the visitors in the second half, thanks in large part to some shaky goalkeeping by Villarreal's Gerónimo Rulli.
Liverpool started the second half the on the front foot and maintained that dominance until the final whistle, and they were rewarded massively for their play.
Villarreal were left stunned by the turn of events and a frustrated Étienne Capoue was sent off after being shown his second yellow card of the night on an ill-advised challenge five minutes before full-time.
Liverpool now await the winner of the Real Madrid-Manchester City semi-final tie, which will be decided with Wednesday's second leg.

     Summary: The home fans held their scarves high above their heads, their pride masking the pain.
Villarreal came close on Tuesday, closer than anyone could really have imagined, to making the Champions League final.
At halftime, Unai Emery’s team was in control of the game and in control of the two-legged tie, and Liverpool — the overwhelming favorite — seemed to have had its confidence sapped and its rhythm broken.
Just when it seemed to be in its grasp, Villarreal’s dream was snatched away.
How much it hurt is, perhaps, the best measure of how close it came.

     Summary: Liverpool's three touches in Villarreal's box before the half was their lowest in a first half all season in all competitions.
Diaz ran at Villarreal, defused their first-half tempo and allowed Liverpool to gain control of the game.
Luis Diaz was a game-changer when he came on at halftime in Spain on Tuesday, propelling Liverpool to the UEFA Champions League final.
Luis Diaz scored in the 67th minute of Tuesday's semifinal of the UEFA Champions League and helped lead a turnaround after Villarreal scored twice.
No English team has ever won the Quadruple -- the FA Cup, the Carabao Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the English Premier League -- in a season, but Liverpool moved one step closer in convincing fashion.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Liverpool's pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple remains intact after a spectacular second-half comeback saw the Reds overcome a huge scare against Villarreal in the Champions League semifinal on Tuesday.
Three goals in rapid succession from Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane rocketed Liverpool to a 3-2 victory (5-2 on aggregate) and a third Champions League final in just five years, though the scoreline -- quite literally -- told only half the story.
I am always honest and focus on the Champions League and Premier League.
After the group stage I thought 'OK, we are going to win the Champions League this year'."
Their increased urgency was rewarded when Fabinho, collecting Salah's pass, fired through the legs of Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli to score a timely first Champions League goal for Liverpool and restore the vistors' advantage.

     How Liverpool recovered against Villarreal to reach the Champions League final: Live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool became the first team to book their place in the Champions League final as they came from behind to beat Villarreal 3-2 away from home.
It meant the Reds went through to the Parisian final 5-2 on aggregate thanks to goals on the night from Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane.
Those three goals banished the home side’s hopes of a first Champions League final after Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin had initially wiped out Liverpool’s first-leg advantage.
Villarreal ended the game with 10 men after Etienne Capoue was sent off for being shown a second booking with less than five minutes left.
Jurgen Klopp’s side will now meet either Manchester City or Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes in Paris for the final on May 28.
