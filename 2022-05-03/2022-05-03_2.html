     Phoenix Suns’ Cam Johnson gets 3rd in NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Phoenix Suns wing Cam Johnson finished in third place for the 2021-22 NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, the league announced on Tuesday.
Johnson was a finalist along with Miami Heat guard Tyler Herro and Cleveland Cavaliers big man Kevin Love.
The Suns forward received one first-place vote, 27 second-place votes and 42 third-place votes for a grand total of 128 points.
Johnson’s third-place finish also marks the second Phoenix Sun to be named an NBA award finalist but not a winner after wing Mikal Bridges came in second place for the Defensive Player of the Year Award.
The last Phoenix player to bring home the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award was the Brazilian Blur Leandro Barbosa back in 2006-07 during the Seven Seconds or Less Suns era.

     NBA Playoffs: Suns starters shine against Mavericks, Heat get a win against Joel Embiid-less Sixers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Deandre Ayton scored 25 points for the Suns, as all five starters finished in double-figures.
CNN —The Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat secured wins in Game 1 of their respective second round playoff series: Miami defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 106-92 while the Suns beat the Dallas Mavericks 121-114.
Doncic scored more points than the rest of the Mavs’ starters who managed just 39 points between them.
Doncic's career postseason scoring average of 33.4 points now matches Michael Jordan's average for the highest in NBA playoff history.
“We’ll take the win,” Suns point guard Chris Paul – who contributed 19 points and five rebounds – said.

     Summary: So Williams didn’t even remember the Phoenix Suns named him head coach exactly three years ago to the day, May 3, 2019.
Williams enjoys making those trips to Texas to fish during those rare free moments, but Phoenix is where his heart is.
Williams admitted he wasn’t sure he’d be a head coach again.
New Orleans gave him his first opportunity to be a head coach in 2010.
You hope, but you don’t know, and for me, it’s always been like, I don’t want to hope somebody else gets fired so I can get a job.

     What Suns' Game 1 Victory Against Dallas Means For Rest Of Series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A seven-point victory in favor of Phoenix really does not tell the real story in Game 1 of this Western Conference Semifinals series between the Phoenix Suns and Dallas Mavericks.
Really nothing went wrong for the Phoenix Suns in Game 1 of this series and while the first games can sometimes be “fools gold,” the Suns are no fools.
Here is what Game 1 between the Mavericks and Suns taught us.
2 scorer to step up next to Doncic in order to simply contend in this series against the Suns.
In this series though for Phoenix against the Dallas Mavericks, it is the Suns that now have the edge in terms of rebounding simply because the Mavericks lack size.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The final result, a Phoenix Suns 121-114 win over the Dallas Mavericks to take a 1-0 series lead, will go down in the books as a clean, decisive victory.
After the JaVale dunk, the Mavericks went on a quick 5-0 run to cut the lead to 16 with a pair of clean shots sandwiching a Suns turnover.
It got the Suns just far enough off their spots to create confusion... and missed shots.
While Monty Williams talked about missed shots and Chris Paul chose to look on the bright side.
To win this series, the Suns will need be relentless.

The Suns destroyed the Mavs on the boards 51-36 and pulled down 13 offensive rebounds.
Devin Booker, meanwhile, produced his 19th game in the postseason with 20 points or more and gave Doncic plenty of problems.
Led by Deandre Ayton’s (we’ll get to him later) team-high 25 points, Phoenix finished with six double-figures scorers.
In explaining Dallas’ myriad problems with communication in the first half, Doncic pretty much announced what the Mavs are expecting Wednesday for Game 2.
