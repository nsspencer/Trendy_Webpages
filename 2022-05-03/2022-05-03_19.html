     Summary: dsantiago@miamiherald.comThe best regular season in Florida Panthers history ended with franchise records for points, wins and goals, an offensive explosion the NHL hasn’t seen in more than two decades and a Presidents’ Trophy.
In the regular season, Florida was 39-0 when leading at the end of the second period.
