     How a 'perfect storm' of risk factors led to Hailey Bieber's medical scare
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A stroke expert with Novant Health explains the difference between a stroke and "ministroke" and discusses what people should know about the model's risk factors.
Example video title will go here for this videoCHARLOTTE, N.C. — Model Hailey Baldwin Bieber took to YouTube to address her health scare in March, calling her ministroke a result of a "perfect storm" of medical factors.
Dr. Ryan Fillmore, neuro-intensivist and medical director of the stroke program at Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center, said Bieber's symptoms were classic signs of a stroke, which is a blockage of blood flow to the brain.
In her case, however, the quicker passing of symptoms made Bieber's a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which many people call a ministroke.
"When symptoms last more than 24 hours, at that point, you would be considered to have had a stroke," Fillmore said.

     Hailey Bieber Wants You to Talk to Your Doctor Before Starting Birth Control
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Studies show that estrogen-based birth control pills can slightly increase the risk of stroke for people who have migraine with aura.
Bieber's doctors told her that three factors likely contributed to the blood clot: a recent long-haul flight to and from Paris, recovering from COVID-19, and her recent prescription of birth control pills.
When it comes to birth control, medical advice can be muddled.
In some cases, birth control pills may help reduce symptoms of menstrual migraines by keeping estrogen levels constant.
In the past, Ruzzo experienced painful side effects from birth control, including suicidality and uterine fibroids, which are common in many women.
