     Ohio Primary Election 2022: Live Results, Map, and Analysis
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If candidates who endorse Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was stolen win control of state offices, Trump and his supporters could be poised to challenge the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election.
Control of the House and Senate will be decided as well, and history is against the Democrats.
The party of the sitting President has typically lost seats in Congress after his first two years in office.
If Democrats lose their narrow majority in the House or Senate, Biden’s ability to enact significant legislation will be blocked.
The New Yorker will publish election results, as reported by the Associated Press, as well as news coverage and commentary, throughout the 2022 campaign.
