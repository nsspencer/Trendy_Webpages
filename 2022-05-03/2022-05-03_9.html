     Analysis: It looks like Susan Collins bet wrong on Brett Kavanaugh and Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) As Sen. Susan Collins was preparing to cast a deciding vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in 2018, the Maine Republican insisted that he had told her directly that he considered Roe v. Wade settled law.
"My fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so we have far fewer 5-4 decisions and so that public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court is restored," she said in a floor speech announcing her decision.
In an interview with CNN the following year, Collins, who supports abortion rights, said that Kavanaugh "said under oath many times, as well as to me personally many times, that he considers Roe to be 'precedent upon precedent' because it had been reaffirmed in the Casey v. Planned Parenthood case."
Similarly, Collins told CNN in 2018 that she didn't believe Justice Neil Gorsuch, who she voted to confirm the previous year, would want to overturn Roe v. Wade.
"I had a very long discussion with Justice Gorsuch in my office and he pointed out to me that he is a co-author of a whole book on precedent," Collins said at the time.

     Sen. Collins: 'Completely inconsistent' that Gorsuch, Kavanaugh would support overturning Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Tuesday that a Supreme Court draft opinion circulated in February that suggests Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would be among the majority of conservative justices to support overturning Roe v. Wade went against what they said during their confirmation hearings.
At the time, Collins, who supports abortion rights, said his opinion about whether Roe v. Wade set a precedent would influence her decision about whether to back his nomination.
Collins told reporters afterward that Kavanaugh reassured her that the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling protecting a woman's right to an abortion is "settled law."
Collins announced her decision to back Kavanaugh in a floor speech before the Senate vote, repeatedly saying Kavanaugh had indicated multiple times that he wouldn't support reversing Roe v. Wade.
NBC News reported that when Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York met with Kavanaugh, he was unsatisfied with Kavanaugh's answers about Roe v. Wade, saying Kavanaugh refused to say whether the case or Planned Parenthood v. Casey had been correctly decided.

     Summary: Mills, and Republican challenger Paul LePage issued statements after the leak of a draft Supreme Court decision that would overturn Roe v. Wade.
Maine’s politicians reacted to the leaked draft abortion decision.
“Maine state law already prohibits abortion after viability and our laws should keep pace with modern, medical technology.
The case before the U.S. Supreme Court is on state prohibitions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
I know people are scared, so let me be clear — (Maine Senate Democrats) are committed to protecting Mainers’ right to abortion.

     Summary: If Roe v. Wade is overturned, and it’s looking very likely that that will be the case, millions of pregnant people will lose the right to an abortion overnight.
But what are Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski most worried about right now?
“He said that he agreed with what Justice [John] Roberts said at his nomination hearings, in which he said that it was settled law,” Collins told reporters at the time.
Oh, and she also signed a letter calling for the end of the “barbaric” Roe v. Wade.
As of Tuesday, Collins and Murkowski were both said to be against getting rid of the filibuster, which would allow the Senate to pass legislation codifying Roe v. Wade now.

Of all the things the leaked opinion is, inconsistent ain’t one of them.
“I do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh will overturn Roe v. Wade,” Collins said in 2018.
Justice Lewis Powell was the court’s most surprising signatory to the original Roe opinion.
I ask this with grim sincerity: How many would have to die for Susan Collins to lose her innocence?

     Summary: At times, the Maine Republican seems to be either living in an alternate political universe or playing the role of a well-intentioned naïf on purpose.
In a statement reacting to the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, Collins expressed shock (or faux shock?)
that she had been misled by two conservative justices she voted to confirm, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.
(Collins did vote no on Donald Trump’s third Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, but she said her decision stemmed from the timing of the nomination.)
It’s still possible that Kavanaugh will shift his position before the actual decision is made public.

She went out of her way to vouch for both of them when their opponents predicted they’d support overturning Roe.
