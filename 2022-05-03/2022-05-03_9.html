     Penguins’ Rickard Rakell leaves Game 1 after high, hard hit by Rangers’ Ryan Lindgren
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pittsburgh Penguins forward Rickard Rakell left Monday’s playoff opener against the New York Rangers after absorbing a hit to his head area late of the first period of Game 1 of the first-round series at Madison Square Garden.
The Penguins’ second-line right wing, Rakell was subjected to a penalized check from Ryan Lindgren.
Playing the ensuing 4 1/2 periods with 11 forwrads, the Penguins won Tuesday’s game, 4-3, on an Evgeni Malkin goal in the third overtime.
Penguins wing Jake Guentzel simultaneously was subjected to a hit that had him gingerly getting up from the ice.
Penguins defenseman John Marino also absorbed at least two hits during a physical first period in which official NHL stats credited the Rangers with 19 hits and the Penguins 10.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pittsburgh Penguins had a rough first period against the New York Rangers in Game 1 of their Round One series.
Not only did New York significantly outshoot them and lead 1-0, but Penguins wingers Rickard Rakell and Jake Guentzel were injured on the same sequence late in the first period.
Rakell was nearly knocked out.
The Pittsburgh Penguins did not score on the power play in the first period but had nearly 40 seconds of the man-advantage remaining.
Rangers defenseman Adam Fox may have further hurt the Pittsburgh Penguins roster when he hit Jake Guentzel in the corner.

     Penguins vs. Rangers Game 1 Odds, Pick: Sidney Crosby slated to be difference maker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For the first time in five years, the New York Rangers will play a playoff game at Madison Square Garden.
The Blueshirts are -135 favorites for Game 1 against the Pittsburgh Penguins, but the series odds — which have the Rangers at -115 and the Pens at -105 — suggest this best-of-7 is essentially a coin flip.
While recent form points to the Rangers, the biggest edge in this series is in the blue paint with Igor Shesterkin.
Despite wobbling down the stretch, the Penguins finished the regular season with the eighth-best expected goals rate and eighth-best high-danger scoring chance rate.
The Rangers have plenty of signals pointing to them and there are cases to be made for the Penguins.

     Summary: It was a contest that featured an all-time performance by Rangers goalie Igor Shesterkin and a stunning relief effort from the Penguins' goalie Louis Domingue.
While Shesterkin was making his saves at one end, the Penguins had some goaltending drama in Game 1.
Despite being ice cold, Domingue made 14 saves in the second overtime and then three more in the third overtime before Malkin won it.
The Rangers grew that lead to 2-0 on an Andrew Copp goal at 3:08 of the second period.
The Penguins came alive in the second period, putting New York on its toes thanks to an effective forecheck.

     Malkin! Penguins Beat Rangers in 3 OT, Take 1-0 Series Lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — The Pittsburgh Penguins absorbed a lot of punishment from the New York Rangers during Game 1 of their opening-round playoff series Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.
Evgeni Malkin scored the game-winning goal at 5:58 of the third extra period, deflecting a John Marino shot past New York goalie Igor Shesterkin, who finished with 79 saves.
Adam Fox got it at 9:19, 21 seconds after Teddy Blueger was penalized for holding, when he threw a wrist shot past DeSmith from the high slot.
New York not only was faster than the Penguins during the early stages of play, but was far more aggressive.
The Rangers’ physicality not only allowed them to control the period, but could wear down the Penguins as the series progresses.

     Summary: Pittsburgh Penguins forward Rickard Rakell was forced to leave Game 1 against the New York Rangers after a hit from Ryan Lindgren.
Late in the first period, Rakell was carrying the puck down the wing when Lindgren stood up and hit him at the blue line.
Rakell was slow to get up but did skate off the ice with the help of teammates.
The officials initially called Lindgren for a five-minute major for charging but after an automatic video review, reduced the penalty to a two-minute minor for roughing.
Rakell did not rejoin his teammates for the start of the second period.
