     Susan Collins Shocked That Brett Kavanaugh Would Ever Lie to a Woman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Senator Susan Collins, who had been assured by Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 that he considered Roe v. Wade “settled law,” said today that she was “shocked” that the Supreme Court Justice “would ever lie to a woman.”“When I met with Justice Kavanaugh before his confirmation hearings, he looked me in the eye and said that he considered Roe v. Wade the law of the land,” she said.
“Nothing in his confirmation hearings suggested that he would ever be less than trustworthy with a woman.”“As I watched his Senate testimony, I felt even more confident that he had told me the truth,” she added.
“His utter respect for a woman’s right to make decisions for herself came shining through.”In the aftermath of the leaked Supreme Court draft ruling and reports that Kavanaugh voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, however, Collins is reassessing her ability to tell whether someone is lying to her.
“My conduct in this matter has left me troubled and concerned,” she said.

     Collins calls draft Roe opinion 'completely inconsistent' with what Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said during hearings and meetings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) GOP Sen. Susan Collins said on Tuesday that a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade published by Politico was "completely inconsistent" with what Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh "said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office."
"If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office," Collins said in a statement.
"Obviously, we won't know each Justice's decision and reasoning until the Supreme Court officially announces its opinion in this case."
Asked if she was misled by Kavanaugh, Collins told CNN, "My statement speaks for itself."
On Monday, Politico reported it had obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If Roe v. Wade is overturned, and it’s looking very likely that that will be the case, millions of pregnant people will lose the right to an abortion overnight.
But what are Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski most worried about right now?
“He said that he agreed with what Justice [John] Roberts said at his nomination hearings, in which he said that it was settled law,” Collins told reporters at the time.
Oh, and she also signed a letter calling for the end of the “barbaric” Roe v. Wade.
As of Tuesday, Collins and Murkowski were both said to be against getting rid of the filibuster, which would allow the Senate to pass legislation codifying Roe v. Wade now.

     Summary: Collins comes from a very different time, now a long-dead world.
Cohen was a genuine moderate at a time when there were loads of moderates in both parties, even a sprinkling of actual liberals in the Republican Party.
It would all be forgivable, I suppose, except look who pays for Collins’s suspended-in-aspic belief system: poor women; women whose net worths aren’t a few million dollars, like Collins’s; and women who don’t live in New England, where the right to an abortion will likely remain legal.
Her land of make-believe maybe made her feel good, and it apparently helped her get reelected, but it is going to harm thousands of women.
And that is not forgivable.

Obviously, we won’t know each Justice’s decision and reasoning until the Supreme Court officially announces its opinion in this case,” Collins said Tuesday morning.
Janet Mills, who has signed into law several bills expanding access to abortion services, pledged late Monday night to defend abortion rights.
“At Planned Parenthood, we know that banning abortion does not take away people’s need to access abortion care.
Patients who need to access abortion should not face the shame and overwhelming hurdles that will come from this decision.

     Susan Collins: Leaked Roe opinion 'inconsistent' with previous statements by Kavanaugh, Gorsuch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After news broke Monday night that the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has drafted an opinion overturning the abortion protections in Roe V. Wade , prominent Maine politicians had a range of reactions.
The development put the greatest spotlight on U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican who has expressed support for abortion rights but voted to confirm two of the newest members of the court’s conservative wing: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement on Tuesday, Collins said that the leaked opinion was at odds with previous comments they had made.
Collins : “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office.
But it is only a *draft* opinion and ABORTION REMAINS LEGAL in this country.

     Summary: At times, the Maine Republican seems to be either living in an alternate political universe or playing the role of a well-intentioned naïf on purpose.
In a statement reacting to the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, Collins expressed shock (or faux shock?)
that she had been misled by two conservative justices she voted to confirm, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.
(Collins did vote no on Donald Trump’s third Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, but she said her decision stemmed from the timing of the nomination.)
It’s still possible that Kavanaugh will shift his position before the actual decision is made public.

     Sen. Collins: 'Completely inconsistent' that Gorsuch, Kavanaugh would support overturning Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Tuesday that a Supreme Court draft opinion circulated in February that suggests Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would be among the majority of conservative justices to support overturning Roe v. Wade went against what they said during their confirmation hearings.
At the time, Collins, who supports abortion rights, said his opinion on whether Roe v. Wade sets a precedent would influence her decision on whether to back his nomination.
Collins told reporters after her conversation with him that Kavanaugh assured her that the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling protecting a woman's right to an abortion is "settled law."
The GOP senator announced her decision to back Kavanaugh in a floor speech ahead of the Senate vote, repeatedly stating that Kavanaugh had indicated multiple times that he wouldn't support reversing Roe v. Wade.
When then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., met with Kavanaugh, NBC News reported he was unsatisfied with the nominee's answers on Roe v. Wade, saying Kavanaugh refused to say whether that case or Planned Parenthood v. Casey were correctly decided.

Murkowski voted to confirm Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett in 2020.
Politico, which first published Alito’s draft opinion, reported that all three Trump-nominated justices initially voted with Alito to wholly overturn Roe.
But they said that all of the indications that the three Trump judges could ultimately overturn Roe were plain to see.
