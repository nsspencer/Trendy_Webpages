     Susan Collins Shocked That Brett Kavanaugh Would Ever Lie to a Woman
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Senator Susan Collins, who had been assured by Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 that he considered Roe v. Wade “settled law,” said today that she was “shocked” that the Supreme Court Justice “would ever lie to a woman.”“When I met with Justice Kavanaugh before his confirmation hearings, he looked me in the eye and said that he considered Roe v. Wade the law of the land,” she said.
“Nothing in his confirmation hearings suggested that he would ever be less than trustworthy with a woman.”“As I watched his Senate testimony, I felt even more confident that he had told me the truth,” she added.
“His utter respect for a woman’s right to make decisions for herself came shining through.”In the aftermath of the leaked Supreme Court draft ruling and reports that Kavanaugh voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, however, Collins is reassessing her ability to tell whether someone is lying to her.
“My conduct in this matter has left me troubled and concerned,” she said.

     Sen. Collins: 'Completely inconsistent' that Gorsuch, Kavanaugh would support overturning Roe v. Wade
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Tuesday that a Supreme Court draft opinion circulated in February that suggests Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would be among the majority of conservative justices to support overturning Roe v. Wade went against what they said during their confirmation hearings.
At the time, Collins, who supports abortion rights, said his opinion about whether Roe v. Wade set a precedent would influence her decision about whether to back his nomination.
Collins told reporters afterward that Kavanaugh reassured her that the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling protecting a woman's right to an abortion is "settled law."
Collins announced her decision to back Kavanaugh in a floor speech before the Senate vote, repeatedly saying Kavanaugh had indicated multiple times that he wouldn't support reversing Roe v. Wade.
NBC News reported that when Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York met with Kavanaugh, he was unsatisfied with Kavanaugh's answers about Roe v. Wade, saying Kavanaugh refused to say whether the case or Planned Parenthood v. Casey had been correctly decided.

     Susan Collins: Leaked Roe opinion 'inconsistent' with previous statements by Kavanaugh, Gorsuch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After news broke Monday night that the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has drafted an opinion overturning the abortion protections in Roe V. Wade , prominent Maine politicians had a range of reactions.
The development put the greatest spotlight on U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican who has expressed support for abortion rights but voted to confirm two of the newest members of the court’s conservative wing: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement on Tuesday, Collins said that the leaked opinion was at odds with previous comments they had made.
Collins : “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office.
But it is only a *draft* opinion and ABORTION REMAINS LEGAL in this country.

     Summary: U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said Tuesday morning that a leaked abortion decision contradicts what Supreme Court nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh told her about their views on the Roe v. Wade precedent.
Obviously, we won’t know each Justice’s decision and reasoning until the Supreme Court officially announces its opinion in this case,” Collins said Tuesday morning.
Janet Mills, who has signed into law several bills expanding access to abortion services, pledged late Monday night to defend abortion rights.
“At Planned Parenthood, we know that banning abortion does not take away people’s need to access abortion care.
Patients who need to access abortion should not face the shame and overwhelming hurdles that will come from this decision.

     Summary: At times, the Maine Republican seems to be either living in an alternate political universe or playing the role of a well-intentioned naïf on purpose.
In a statement reacting to the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, Collins expressed shock (or faux shock?)
that she had been misled by two conservative justices she voted to confirm, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.
(Collins did vote no on Donald Trump’s third Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, but she said her decision stemmed from the timing of the nomination.)
It’s still possible that Kavanaugh will shift his position before the actual decision is made public.

     What Susan Collins Says Brett Kavanaugh Told Her About Roe v. Wade

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a leaked U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion late Monday reportedly showed that a majority of justices voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, past comments from Senator Susan Collins regarding Justice Brett Kavanaugh have resurfaced.
Resurfaced comments from Collins show that she said on several occasions that Kavanaugh told her he viewed Roe v. Wade as a "settled law" and deeply rooted precedent.
A video showing several clips of Collins' past comments on Kavanaugh's Roe v. Wade stance showed that in one 2018 appearance on CNN, she said that she does not believe he would overturn the decision.
In another clip included in the video, Collins said that Kavanaugh said he agreed with what Chief Justice John Roberts said at his own confirmation hearing about Roe v. Wade being "settled law."

In explaining her support, Collins said that the judges expressed their respect for honoring legal precedents.
