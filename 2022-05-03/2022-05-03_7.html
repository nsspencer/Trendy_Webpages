     Liverpool’s Dream Delivered, Only After Villarreal’s Is Dashed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Villarreal’s bench emptied onto the field, coaches and substitutes and sundry assistants all scarcely able to believe what they were seeing.
At that moment, tied at 2-2 halfway through the second leg, Villarreal’s players stood within touching distance.
Villarreal would be the smallest town, by some distance, to send a team to the biggest game in soccer.
Villarreal, in the space of 45 minutes, had traveled all the way along it.
Five minutes later, Díaz had scored, drifting in to head a cross under Rulli.

     How Liverpool recovered against Villarreal to reach the Champions League final: Live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool became the first team to book their place in the Champions League final as they came from behind to beat Villarreal 3-2 away from home.
It meant the Reds went through to the Parisian final 5-2 on aggregate thanks to goals on the night from Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane.
Those three goals banished the home side’s hopes of a first Champions League final after Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin had initially wiped out Liverpool’s first-leg advantage.
Villarreal ended the game with 10 men after Etienne Capoue was sent off for being shown a second booking with less than five minutes left.
Jurgen Klopp’s side will now meet either Manchester City or Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes in Paris for the final on May 28.

     Summary: Liverpool overcame a rocky first half to beat Villarreal 3-2 on Tuesday night and book a spot in the Champions League final, winning the tie against their LaLiga opposition 5-2 on aggregate.
Liverpool scored a massive first goal in the 62nd minute, as Villarreal keeper Geronimo Rulli let Fabinho's powerful shot from a Mohamed Salah assist go through his legs.
Substitute Diaz then made his presence felt soon after, heading Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross down and through Rulli's legs again to level the match and give Liverpool a 4-2 aggregate lead they would not relinquish.

     Summary: There’s plenty on the line when Villarreal meets Liverpool in Champions League play Tuesday, May 3.
Villarreal could be facing its last Champions League night in a while if it doesn’t pull off another upset on Tuesday against Liverpool.
That means only the Champions League title is likely to allow the club back into Europe’s top club competition next season.
Villarreal hasn’t lost a home match in more than five months, since a Spanish league loss to Barcelona last November.
Villarreal qualified for the Champions League this season by winning the second-tiered Europa League for its first significant title.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Villarreal CF briefly wrote themselves into UEFA Champions League history on Tuesday by producing a magnificent 2-0 first half display against Liverpool having trailed by two goals from the first leg.
Given no chance pre-game, Villarreal were the better side for the first half of the second leg after holding Liverpool scoreless for nearly an hour in the first.
Considering the financial disparity between the two, this tie should arguably have been over before it began, yet it was not.
The home side even made light of leading scorer Arnaut Danjuma's absence with Dia and half-fit Gerard Moreno up top.
In fact, it can only be considered a collapse because Villarreal fought back from the brink to make it that.

     Liverpool reaches Champions League final after being rocked by Villarreal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Liverpool's pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple remains intact after a spectacular second-half comeback saw the Reds overcome a huge scare against Villarreal in the Champions League semifinal on Tuesday.
Three goals in rapid succession from Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane rocketed Liverpool to a 3-2 victory (5-2 on aggregate) and a third Champions League final in just five years, though the scoreline -- quite literally -- told only half the story.
I am always honest and focus on the Champions League and Premier League.
After the group stage I thought 'OK, we are going to win the Champions League this year'."
Their increased urgency was rewarded when Fabinho, collecting Salah's pass, fired through the legs of Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli to score a timely first Champions League goal for Liverpool and restore the vistors' advantage.

     Summary: The home fans held their scarves high above their heads, their pride masking the pain.
Villarreal came close on Tuesday, closer than anyone could really have imagined, to making the Champions League final.
At halftime, Unai Emery’s team was in control of the game and in control of the two-legged tie, and Liverpool — the overwhelming favorite — seemed to have had its confidence sapped and its rhythm broken.
Just when it seemed to be in its grasp, Villarreal’s dream was snatched away.
How much it hurt is, perhaps, the best measure of how close it came.

Francis Coquelin celebrates after scoring Villarreal’s second goal to level the tie on aggregate.
Liverpool had not been beaten by more than two goals all season and even the atmosphere didn’t seem conducive to a comeback.
The bad news was that they had done so much so fast that, like Liverpool, they had a decision to make.
The team that, led by Díaz, some footballing Sonic the Hedgehog, now tore into them.
