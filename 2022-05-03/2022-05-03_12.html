     AMD Earnings Show Key Products Are Taking Share from Intel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Advanced Micro Devices’ high-end server-chip business is thriving and taking share from Intel.
That’s the key takeaway from AMD’s latest quarterly results released on Tuesday.
The chip maker’s stock jumped on the news in late trading.
Chip maker AMD said revenue from its EPYC server processor business more than doubled during the March quarter.
In comparison, last week Intel (ticker: INTC) reported 22% year-over-year growth for its data-center server unit for the same period.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Here's how the chipmaker did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates in the quarter ending March: EPS : $1.13, adjusted, versus $0.91 expected, up 117% year-over-year: $1.13, adjusted, versus $0.91 expected, up 117% year-over-year Revenue: $5.89 billion, versus $5.52 billion expected, up 71% year-over-year AMD said it expected $6.5 billion in sales in the current quarter, ahead of analyst expectations of $6.38 billion.
Lisa Su, CEO, AMD Scott Mlyn | CNBCOne highlight for AMD is its high-end server chip business, which primarily competes with Intel.
Some data points show that AMD has taken market share from its rival while it tries to get its manufacturing prowess back.
Some analysts suggest that PC sales could shrink this year after two years where shipments exploded as people needed laptops to work from home or go to school remotely.
Some investors believe that the pandemic PC boom is over, but AMD, which supplies the processor at the heart of many laptops and desktops, isn't feeling the decline.

     AMD Stocks Surges On Solid Q1 Earnings Beat, Bullish Chip Sales Outlook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AMD posted earnings of $1.13 per share for the three months ending in March, topping Street forecasts by 22 cents, on adjusted revenues of $5.89 billion.
Gross margins rose 700 basis points from last year to 53%, topping analysts' estimates of a 52.4% print.
There is some softness in the PC market.
Earlier this year, AMD pushed deeper into the lucrative data center market with the $1.9 billion purchase of enterprise services start-up group Pensando.
AMD is also getting a boost from its $35 billion takeover of Xilinx (XLNX) - Get Xilinx, Inc. Report.

     AMD CEO Lisa Su says chipmaker has reached a 'significant inflection point' (NASDAQ:AMD)

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Chief Executive Lisa Su said Tuesday that with the completion of its Xilinx acquisition and plans to acquire Pensando, the chipmaker has reached a "significant inflection point" in its technological transformation.
For the quarter that ended March 26, AMD (AMD) earned $1.13 a share, excluding one-time items, on revenue of $5.9 billion.
Those results topped the estimates of Wall Street analysts, who had forecast AMD (AMD) to earn $0.93 a share, on $5.57 billion in revenue.
Xilinx contributed $559 million in sales for the six weeks it was included in AMD's (AMD) results.
With that performance in the bag, investors sent AMD's (AMD) shares up by more than 6% in after-hours trading.

     AMD hits a sales milestone and expects another one to follow as data-center strategy comes together
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Back in February, AMD forecast gross margins of 51% for 2022, and revenue of about $21.5 billion.
From Xilinx, AMD gets so-called field-programmable gate array, or FPGA, chips that can be configured by a customer or a designer after they are made.
Additionally in the data-center space, AMD announced in April that it was acquiring data-center platform software company Pensando for $1.9 billion.
For years, AMD has made it difficult to measure data-center performance by refusing to separate those sales out from console sales.
On the call, Su said that data-center sales currently account a “low 20s-percent” of revenue.
