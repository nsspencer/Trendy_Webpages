     Collins calls draft Roe opinion 'completely inconsistent' with what Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said during hearings and meetings
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) GOP Sen. Susan Collins said on Tuesday that a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade published by Politico was "completely inconsistent" with what Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh "said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office."
"If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office," Collins said in a statement.
"Obviously, we won't know each Justice's decision and reasoning until the Supreme Court officially announces its opinion in this case."
Asked if she was misled by Kavanaugh, Collins told CNN, "My statement speaks for itself."
On Monday, Politico reported it had obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If Roe v. Wade is overturned, and it’s looking very likely that that will be the case, millions of pregnant people will lose the right to an abortion overnight.
But what are Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski most worried about right now?
“He said that he agreed with what Justice [John] Roberts said at his nomination hearings, in which he said that it was settled law,” Collins told reporters at the time.
Oh, and she also signed a letter calling for the end of the “barbaric” Roe v. Wade.
As of Tuesday, Collins and Murkowski were both said to be against getting rid of the filibuster, which would allow the Senate to pass legislation codifying Roe v. Wade now.

     Susan Collins: Leaked Roe opinion 'inconsistent' with previous statements by Kavanaugh, Gorsuch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After news broke Monday night that the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has drafted an opinion overturning the abortion protections in Roe V. Wade , prominent Maine politicians had a range of reactions.
The development put the greatest spotlight on U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican who has expressed support for abortion rights but voted to confirm two of the newest members of the court’s conservative wing: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement on Tuesday, Collins said that the leaked opinion was at odds with previous comments they had made.
Collins : “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office.
But it is only a *draft* opinion and ABORTION REMAINS LEGAL in this country.

In explaining her support, Collins said that the judges expressed their respect for honoring legal precedents.

In September, the PAC for the 128,000-member American Association of Family Physicians contributed $1,000 to Collins’ PAC and also publicly opposed a Texas law that outlawed abortions after six weeks.

     Senate’s Biggest Sucker Complains About Being Suckered

     Summary: At times, the Maine Republican seems to be either living in an alternate political universe or playing the role of a well-intentioned naïf on purpose.
In a statement reacting to the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, Collins expressed shock (or faux shock?)
that she had been misled by two conservative justices she voted to confirm, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.
(Collins did vote no on Donald Trump’s third Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, but she said her decision stemmed from the timing of the nomination.)
It’s still possible that Kavanaugh will shift his position before the actual decision is made public.

Key BackgroundPolitico published a purported draft opinion, obtained by an unnamed source, that appears to show a majority of the court agreeing to overturn Roe v. Wade.
The draft doesn’t show which justices concurred with Alito, but an anonymous source familiar with the decision told Politico Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Clarence Thomas, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh sided with Alito’s argument.

Collins voted for two of former President Donald Trump’s three nominees to the Supreme Court: Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.
She went out of her way to vouch for both of them when their opponents predicted they’d support overturning Roe.
There was never any real question about what a conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court was expected to do.
