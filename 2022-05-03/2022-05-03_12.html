     Summary: Watch : Emma Stone's 33rd Birthday: Live From E!
Emma Stone and Kieran Culkin have come a long way since they started dating on the set of 2011's Paper Man.
The exes caught up at the Met Gala 2022 on May 2, posing for a photo inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
For the picture, Kieran wrapped an arm around Emma's waist as attendees looked on—likely unaware that the two actors even dated.
By 2011, though, they had gone their separate ways, just before Emma started dating Spider-Man co-star Andrew Garfield.

In fact, Stone donned this LWD stunner as an afterparty dress to her secret 2020 wedding to her husband Dave McCary.
Since photos from the nuptials were kept under wraps by the private couple, this was the first time we ever caught a glimpse of any of Stone's wedding looks.

     Emma Stone Rewore a Dress From Her Wedding to the Met Gala
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Met Gala has Tuesday morning stylists.
Oscar-winner Emma Stone appeared on the steps of the Met for last night’s “Gilded Glamour”-themed Met Gala in a sweet, deceptively simple-seeming white dress from Louis Vuitton.
As it turns out, Stone originally wore the dress on her wedding day.
While it wasn’t the gown she wore to the alter, it was designed by Louis Vuitton creative director Nicolas Ghesquière for her reception.
Louis Vuitton plans to reach 100 percent on those and other metrics by 2025.
