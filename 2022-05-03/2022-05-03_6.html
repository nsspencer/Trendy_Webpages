     Penguins' Jeff Carter earns respect of teammates, enjoying complementary role
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But for the Pittsburgh Penguins, as Carter put it on the eve of this postseason, he is “just another piece” of the leadership core.
“This is their team,” Carter said, referring to the Penguins triumvirate of Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang.
But that doesn’t mean his stature as a possible future Hall of Famer doesn’t carry weight in the Penguins dressing room.
“Especially lately, I think he’s really been really keeping us on track.
Coach Mike Sullivan, though, notes that even Crosby, Malkin and Letang look up to Carter.

     Sidney Crosby, 17 Seasons On, Is Ready to Wreck the N.H.L. Playoffs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: players have been at it longer than Crosby, and six others came into the league with him in 2005.
With the exception of Alex Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals forward who is chasing Wayne Gretzky’s career goals record, no player of Crosby’s age or with 17 seasons under his skates has been as dominant.
No one has watched Crosby more closely than Andy O’Brien.
A strength and conditioning coach, O’Brien met Crosby at a summer hockey school when the player was 13.
This summer will be their 22nd working together in Crosby’s off-season home near Halifax, Nova Scotia.

     Summary: Evgeni Malkin deflects the puck in the third overtime to give the Penguins a 4-3 win over the Rangers in Game 1.
It was a contest that featured an all-time performance by Rangers goalie Igor Shesterkin and a stunning relief effort from Penguins counterpart Louis Domingue.
The Rangers grew the lead to 2-0 on an Andrew Copp goal at 3:08 of the second period.
The Penguins came alive in the second period, putting New York on its toes thanks to an effective forecheck.
Sullivan said that DeSmith is day-to-day and would not commit to Domingue starting that game for the Penguins.

     Malkin! Penguins Beat Rangers in 3 OT, Take 1-0 Series Lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — The Pittsburgh Penguins absorbed a lot of punishment from the New York Rangers during Game 1 of their opening-round playoff series Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.
Evgeni Malkin scored the game-winning goal at 5:58 of the third extra period, deflecting a John Marino shot past New York goalie Igor Shesterkin, who finished with 79 saves.
Adam Fox got it at 9:19, 21 seconds after Teddy Blueger was penalized for holding, when he threw a wrist shot past DeSmith from the high slot.
New York not only was faster than the Penguins during the early stages of play, but was far more aggressive.
The Rangers’ physicality not only allowed them to control the period, but could wear down the Penguins as the series progresses.
