     Ohio 2022 Primary Election Results
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan cruised his way to his party’s nomination for an open Senate seat Tuesday and will now take on the winner of one of the most contentious and closely watched Republican primaries in the nation.
Author and venture capitalist JD Vance is seen as the GOP frontrunner in the race to replace retiring Sen.
The race is seen as a critical early test of Trump’s endorsement power as the midterm primary season kicks into high gear.
Ryan was heavily favored to win his three-way Democratic primary against progressive Morgan Harper, a former consumer protection attorney, and Columbus activist and tech exec Traci Johnson.
But he is expected to face an uphill battle this fall in a state that was once a political bellwether but voted for Trump twice by an 8-point margin.

     Election 2022: JD Vance Wins Ohio's GOP Senate Primary
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Vance will face Democrat Tim Ryan, the 10-term Democratic congressman who easily won his three-way primary Tuesday night.
Rob Portman is expected to be an uphill climb for Ryan in a state Trump won twice by an 8-point margin and in what is expected to be a brutal election year for Democrats trying to hold their congressional majorities.
Democrats, meanwhile, are banking the GOP — with Trump’s help — will elect candidates so extreme they prove unelectable come November.
She defeated former Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley in a race that drew relatively little attention as much of the state focused on the contentious Senate Republican primary and the ongoing redistricting legal battle.
Meanwhile, in Indiana, more than a dozen state House members are trying to hold off Republican primary challengers who want to push the Legislature further to the right.

     Live Updates: J.D. Vance Wins Republican Senate Primary in Ohio
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With more than 80 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Vance was leading across almost the entire state.
But that became an all-but-impossible argument to prosecute in the final weeks after Mr. Trump picked Mr. Vance.
Mr. Mandel told the crowd that he called Mr. Vance “to congratulate him on a hard-fought victory” and would do what he could to help get him elected.
Mr. Vance is one of two former Thiel employees — the other is Blake Masters in Arizona — running for Senate with Mr. Thiel’s hefty financial backing.
Mr. Thiel had served as a key link between Mr. Vance and Mr. Trump, attending an introductory meeting between them in early 2021.
