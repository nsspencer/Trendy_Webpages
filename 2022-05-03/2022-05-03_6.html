     Summary: Villarreal’s bench emptied onto the field, coaches and substitutes and sundry assistants all scarcely able to believe what they were seeing.
At that moment, tied at 2-2 halfway through the second leg, Villarreal’s players stood within touching distance.
Villarreal would be the smallest town, by some distance, to send a team to the biggest game in soccer.
Villarreal, in the space of 45 minutes, had traveled all the way along it.

     How Liverpool recovered against Villarreal to reach the Champions League final: Live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool became the first team to book their place in the Champions League final as they came from behind to beat Villarreal 3-2 away from home.
It meant the Reds went through to the Parisian final 5-2 on aggregate thanks to goals on the night from Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane.
Those three goals banished the home side’s hopes of a first Champions League final after Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin had initially wiped out Liverpool’s first-leg advantage.
Villarreal ended the game with 10 men after Etienne Capoue was sent off for being shown a second booking with less than five minutes left.
Jurgen Klopp’s side will now meet either Manchester City or Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes in Paris for the final on May 28.

     Summary: There’s plenty on the line when Villarreal meets Liverpool in Champions League play Tuesday, May 3.
Villarreal could be facing its last Champions League night in a while if it doesn’t pull off another upset on Tuesday against Liverpool.
That means only the Champions League title is likely to allow the club back into Europe’s top club competition next season.
Villarreal hasn’t lost a home match in more than five months, since a Spanish league loss to Barcelona last November.
Villarreal qualified for the Champions League this season by winning the second-tiered Europa League for its first significant title.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadMADRID — Long after the match ended, Villarreal fans stayed on their feet cheering at the La Cerámica Stadium.
“We were close to excellence,” Villarreal coach Unai Emery said after the team’s 3-2 loss to Liverpool in the second leg of the Champions League semifinals on Tuesday.
It was making only its fourth Champions League appearance, having reached the semifinals in 2006 and the quarterfinals in 2009, both times losing to Arsenal.
It’s what brought us this far.”Returning to the Champions League may be hard for Villarreal, though.
The loss also means there will be no first Champions League trophy for Emery, who had never made it past the round of 16 until now.

     Summary: Villarreal CF briefly wrote themselves into UEFA Champions League history on Tuesday by producing a magnificent 2-0 first half display against Liverpool having trailed by two goals from the first leg.
Given no chance pre-game, Villarreal were the better side for the first half of the second leg after holding Liverpool scoreless for nearly an hour in the first.
Considering the financial disparity between the two, this tie should arguably have been over before it began, yet it was not.
The home side even made light of leading scorer Arnaut Danjuma's absence with Dia and half-fit Gerard Moreno up top.
In fact, it can only be considered a collapse because Villarreal fought back from the brink to make it that.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool's Luis Diaz (second right) celebrates after scoring his side's second goal during the Champions League semifinal, second leg against Villarreal.
CNN —Liverpool’s pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple remains intact after a spectacular second-half comeback saw the Reds overcome a huge scare against Villarreal in the Champions League semifinal on Tuesday.
Three goals in rapid succession from Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane rocketed Liverpool to a 3-2 victory (5-2 on aggregate) and a third Champions League final in just five years, though the scoreline – quite literally – told only half the story.
Early goals from Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin sent the “Yellow Submarine” – affectionately nicknamed due to their luminescent yellow kit – into uncharted waters, threatening to sink Liverpool’s hopes of becoming the first side to win the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup in the same campaign.
I am always honest and focus on the Champions League and Premier League.

Liverpool scored a massive first goal in the 62nd minute, as Villarreal keeper Geronimo Rulli let Fabinho's powerful shot from a Mohamed Salah assist go through his legs.
Substitute Diaz then made his presence felt soon after, heading Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross down and through Rulli's legs again to level the match and give Liverpool a 4-2 aggregate lead they would not relinquish.

     Summary: The home fans held their scarves high above their heads, their pride masking the pain.
Villarreal came close on Tuesday, closer than anyone could really have imagined, to making the Champions League final.
At halftime, Unai Emery’s team was in control of the game and in control of the two-legged tie, and Liverpool — the overwhelming favorite — seemed to have had its confidence sapped and its rhythm broken.
Just when it seemed to be in its grasp, Villarreal’s dream was snatched away.
How much it hurt is, perhaps, the best measure of how close it came.
