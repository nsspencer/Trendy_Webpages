     How Liverpool recovered against Villarreal to reach the Champions League final: Live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Liverpool became the first team to book their place in the Champions League final as they came from behind to beat Villarreal 3-2 away from home.
It meant the Reds went through to the Parisian final 5-2 on aggregate thanks to goals on the night from Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane.
Those three goals banished the home side’s hopes of a first Champions League final after Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin had initially wiped out Liverpool’s first-leg advantage.
Villarreal ended the game with 10 men after Etienne Capoue was sent off for being shown a second booking with less than five minutes left.
Jurgen Klopp’s side will now meet either Manchester City or Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes in Paris for the final on May 28.
