     Penguins Sink Rangers 4-3 in Triple Overtime to Take Game 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Rangers’ exuberance got the better of them at times.
In the second period, the Rangers picked up where they left off.
But just as the Rangers appeared to get comfortable, the Penguins found their footing.
Less than 90 second later Crosby passed the puck in front of the net, where Jake Guentzel, the team’s leading goal scorer, tipped it into the net.
Seven minutes later, Crosby after he sliced through the top of the zone unguarded again found Guentzel again.

     Malkin! Penguins Beat Rangers in 3 OT, Take 1-0 Series Lead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — The Pittsburgh Penguins absorbed a lot of punishment from the New York Rangers during Game 1 of their opening-round playoff series Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.
Evgeni Malkin scored the game-winning goal at 5:58 of the third extra period, deflecting a John Marino shot past New York goalie Igor Shesterkin, who finished with 79 saves.
Adam Fox got it at 9:19, 21 seconds after Teddy Blueger was penalized for holding, when he threw a wrist shot past DeSmith from the high slot.
New York not only was faster than the Penguins during the early stages of play, but was far more aggressive.
The Rangers’ physicality not only allowed them to control the period, but could wear down the Penguins as the series progresses.
