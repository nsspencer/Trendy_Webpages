     Champions League Updates: Liverpool Beats Villarreal to Reach Final
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The home fans held their scarves high above their heads, their pride masking the pain.
Villarreal came close on Tuesday, closer than anyone could really have imagined, to making the Champions League final.
At halftime, Unai Emery’s team was in control of the game and in control of the two-legged tie, and Liverpool — the overwhelming favorite — seemed to have had its confidence sapped and its rhythm broken.
Just when it seemed to be in its grasp, Villarreal’s dream was snatched away.
How much it hurt is, perhaps, the best measure of how close it came.

If Liverpool’s first two journeys to the Champions League final under Jurgen Klopp were characterized by chaos, then the third — likely to be completed on Tuesday — ought to be defined by control.
Ibrahima Konate has been quietly impressive in his first season, locking in a center-back berth for the Champions League campaign.
