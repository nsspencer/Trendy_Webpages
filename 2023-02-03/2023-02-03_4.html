     Chelsea boss Potter still confident of pushing for Prem top 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON -- Chelsea head coach Graham Potter has said he remains "confident" his side can make a push to qualify for the Champions League next season, despite sitting nine points behind fourth-placed Manchester United.
When asked if he was confident the team could still qualify for next season's Champions League, Potter said: "I'm confident with the potential we have.
"What we need to do now is gel the team," Potter added.
"I think you have to look at it all in terms of transfer fees and salaries" Potter said.
"But we're confident in what we're doing and I think we've done a good job and now my job is to improve the team."

     Summary: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been removed from Chelsea's Champions League squad.
Roland Krivec/DeFodi Images via Getty ImagesPierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been omitted from Chelsea's Champions League squad to free up registration spots for the club's new signings.
Aubameyang was pictured in Milan on Friday evening, hours after Chelsea's Champions League squad was announced.
The Gabon international has struggled for form since joining the Premier League club, scoring just three goals in 18 appearances.
Potter's side are 10th in the Premier League and are the lowest scorers in the top 10.

     Mudryk, Fernandez and Joao Felix included in Chelsea Champions League squad with Aubameyang and other signings left out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mykhailo Mudryk, Enzo Fernandez and Joao Felix have all been added to Chelsea’s Champions League for the latter stages of the competition, while Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been left out to make space.
David Datro Fofana, Noni Madueke, Andrey Santos, Gabriel Slonina and Benoit Badiashile have also been left out of Graham Potter’s 25-man European squad.
Chelsea had registered a 24-man squad for the group stages of the Champions League.
Since the 2018-19 season, there has not been a ‘cup-tied’ rule in the Champions League — meaning Mudryk (Shakhtar), Fernandez (Benfica) and Felix (Atletico) were all eligible to be registered despite featuring in the group stages for other teams.

     Same old problems for new-look Chelsea in draw with Fulham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "That bit of connection, that bit of fluidity, that bit of understanding that you need, we lacked a little bit."
Chelsea are currently nine points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester United who have a game in hand.
Fulham boss Marco Silva praised his team, who beat Chelsea 2-1 at Craven Cottage in January.
Rather than worry about Chelsea's new-look squad, he said Fulham made sure they maintained the form that has propelled them to sixth in the table.
"Our focus to be honest is on ourselves ... and what we can do as a team," the Portuguese coach said.

     Chelsea's attacking woe vs. Fulham overshadows bright debut by record signee Enzo Fernandez
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fact the game went goalless -- their third in their past six Premier League games -- summed up their season so far.
Chelsea fans did get a first glimpse at Enzo Fernandez, the new Premier League record signee who arrived in the final minutes of Tuesday's transfer deadline day.
They also have netted the fewest goals (22) in the Premier League top 10, and it's not close.
Fulham fans are wrong -- for a start, there are three Premier League sides in west London -- but Fulham remain on top of the pack.
