     Mudryk, Fernandez and Joao Felix included in Chelsea Champions League squad with Aubameyang and other signings left out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mykhailo Mudryk, Enzo Fernandez and Joao Felix have all been added to Chelsea’s Champions League for the latter stages of the competition, while Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been left out to make space.
David Datro Fofana, Noni Madueke, Andrey Santos, Gabriel Slonina and Benoit Badiashile have also been left out of Graham Potter’s 25-man European squad.
Chelsea had registered a 24-man squad for the group stages of the Champions League.
Since the 2018-19 season, there has not been a ‘cup-tied’ rule in the Champions League — meaning Mudryk (Shakhtar), Fernandez (Benfica) and Felix (Atletico) were all eligible to be registered despite featuring in the group stages for other teams.

     Aubameyang cut from Chelsea squad for Champions League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And on Friday Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang became a high-profile casualty of that midseason shopping spree when he was cut from Chelsea’s squad for the Champions League knockout stages.
Aubameyang, who was signed from Barcelona last summer and started all six of the group stage games, faces an uncertain future after his omission.
It followed $305 million worth of signings in the summer after the consortium bought the club for $2.5 billion last May.
“I don’t understand this part of the business; what you can do, what you cannot do.
I don’t forget, eight or nine teams in the Premier League sent a letter to the Premier League (for us) to be banned.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s future has been placed into further doubt after the striker suffered the humiliation of being omitted from Chelsea’s 25-man Champions League squad.
But another player had to go and Potter has decided that he can do without Aubameyang, who has failed to impress since joining from Barcelona last summer.
Aubameyang has scored only three goals this season and cut a frustrated figure when he became a substituted substitute during Chelsea’s defeat by Manchester City last month.
Chelsea would soon replace Tuchel with Potter, who has gradually eased Aubameyang out of the starting XI.
