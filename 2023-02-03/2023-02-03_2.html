     Summary: Surprise team interested in Derek Carr trade?
Derek Carr will likely be traded or released by the Las Vegas Raiders in the coming days, and a new team has reportedly entered the mix for the veteran quarterback.
Fowler also noted that some interested teams are hoping Carr will be willing to rework his contract.
Carr was benched for the final two games of the regular season, and he has publicly said farewell to the Raiders.
The team now has until February 15 to either release or trade him before they owe him more than $40 million guaranteed over the next two seasons.

     Saints ‘buzzing’ as potential Derek Carr trade destination for Raiders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Las Vegas Raiders’ trade saga with Derek Carr will be a big story in the 2023 NFL offseason.
The potential Carr-to-Saints trade has been “buzzing” at the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama, according to Jeremy Fowler of ESPN.
He still has plenty left in the tank and it might not take much to acquire him since Las Vegas has no leverage.
Now is the time for the Saints to make a move and going after Carr could be huge for them.
A Derek Carr trade (or release) may be coming soon, as the 31-year-old QB is unwilling to push back a trigger date in his contract that would guarantee him $40 million on February 15.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Derek Carr said Thursday night he will not extend the Feb. 15 deadline to help facilitate a trade from the Las Vegas Raiders.
Carr would have to agree to extend the mid-February deadline to ensure any agreements remained in place.
“I don’t think that would be best for me,” said Carr, who has a no-trade clause in his contract.
When asked on ESPN’s broadcast whether he had ever been that hot in Las Vegas, Carr quipped: “Not that hot.
“So for me, that’s just to win, win a championship.

     QB-Needy Teams Expecting Raiders To Release Derek Carr
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From what has become an alternate-heavy Pro Bowl Games in Las Vegas, Derek Carr addressed his unusual situation with the Raiders.
As of now, quarterback-needy teams are expecting the Raiders to release Carr, Jeff Howe of The Athletic notes (subscription required).
“That’s for [the Raiders] to talk about,” Carr said when asked about the Raiders’ refusal to permit talks with other teams.
Still, second-year Raiders GM Dave Ziegler said during a SiriusXM Radio interview (via NFL.com) he expects teams to begin contacting him on a Carr trade.
The Commanders attempted to engage the Raiders in Carr trade talks last year, and they are open to adding a veteran yet again.

     Derek Carr pokes fun at Raiders after winning precision passing competition in Pro Bowl skills challenge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Soon-to-be former Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr was a late addition to the AFC Pro Bowl roster as a replacement, giving him one more shot to toss the pigskin around in Sin City.
The Pro Bowl skills competition kicked off on Thursday night with the precision passing drill, and AFC coach Peyton Manning made the wise decision to have Carr throw third after Trevor Lawrence and Tyler Huntley.
Carr scored 31 total points, lifting the AFC side to victory.
Following the victory, Carr spoke with ESPN's Ryan Clark, who asked him if he had ever been that hot in Las Vegas.
36 overall pick out of Fresno State likely leaves the Raiders as their all-time passing leader (35,222 yards), all-time passing touchdowns leader (217) and second in wins (63).

     Raiders QB Derek Carr Will Not Extend February 15 Trigger Date in Contract
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to ESPN.com, Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr will not extend the February 15 deadline in his contract, one that will trigger $40.4 million in guaranteed money.
Simply put, the Raiders will need to find a trade partner for Carr by February 15.
Las Vegas is moving on from Carr following a disappointing 2022 campaign.
Carr struggled down the stretch, tossing nine interceptions over his final five games as Las Vegas failed to qualify for the postseason.
The former Fresno State standout eventually stepped away from the team after he was benched for the Raiders’ final two games of the regular season.

Carr told NFL Network's Cameron Wolfe that he's still going through all the scenarios.
"I'm going to do what's best for myself.
