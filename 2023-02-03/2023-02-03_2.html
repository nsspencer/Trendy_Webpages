     Summary: Fulham's impressive season continues, meanwhile, as they move up to sixth place, two points above their local rivals but having played a game more.
The effort was there, the spirit was there, but as an attacking team we would like to do more."
Fernandez, though, was a bright spot and at the heart of most of the hosts' best attacking moves in the opening half.
"It's a team game.
We work on it every week," Fulham captain Ream told Sky Sports.

     Enzo Fernandez impresses as Chelsea secure point vs Fulham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: $360 million later, and mid-table Chelsea were able to secure a point in a 0-0 draw with European hopefuls Fulham at Stamford Bridge on Friday.
The Argentine midfield wasted no time and looked a cut above everyone else on the field as he made his Premier League debut with precious little time to train with his new club.
Not even a minute later, Fernandez nearly marked his Chelsea debut with a sensational goal from nearly 30 yards out.
But is anything forgiving any more in the Premier League?
