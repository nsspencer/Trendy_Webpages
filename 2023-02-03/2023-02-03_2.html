     Kyrie Irving asks Nets for trade ahead of deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After failing to negotiate terms on a long-term contract extension with the organization, Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving has issued a trade request to the franchise, sources told ESPN on Friday.
Irving, who will become a free agent this summer, wants out ahead of Thursday's NBA trade deadline -- with the Los Angeles Lakers, Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix Suns expected to explore the possibility of a deal with Brooklyn, sources said.
The Lakers and Mavericks have previously expressed trade interest in Irving and plan to talk with the Nets in the coming days, but both teams are privately expressing limitations on offering significant trade assets for Irving, sources said.
The bigger issue for Brooklyn becomes how All-NBA star Kevin Durant responds to Irving's trade request, and if it causes him to re-think his future with the organization ahead of Thursday's deadline.
Numerous teams are far more interested in how that situation could play out than in trying to inquire on Irving.

     NBA All-Star Kyrie Irving reportedly requests trade from Brooklyn Nets ahead of deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A week removed from being voted a starter in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, mercurial Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving has requested a trade, preferably before next week's deadline, according to multiple reports.
The request comes less than a week before Thursday's NBA trade deadline.
Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving reportedly wants off the team prior to next week's trade deadline.
(Sarah Stier/Getty Images)The request comes seven months after Durant presented his own trade ultimatum to the Nets — trade him or fire both then-head coach Steve Nash and general manager Sean Marks.
Durant's demand came on the heels of Brooklyn granting Irving permission to seek a sign-and-trade deal that never materialized in June.
