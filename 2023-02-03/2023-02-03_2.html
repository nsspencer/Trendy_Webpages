     Lakers Rumors: L.A. Has Had ‘Exploratory Conversations’ With Jazz Involving Russell Westbrook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NBA trade deadline is less than a week away and after stringing together a couple of wins, the time to strike is now for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Los Angeles is still short on outside shooting and could always use more size on the perimeter, so a trade would seem likely.
To that end, the Lakers have been engaged with several teams about trading away Westbrook and it sounds like the Utah Jazz are exploring their options when it comes to the guard, via Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report:The Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz have had exploratory conversations centered around star guard Russell Westbrook, league sources tell Bleacher Report.
Players like Mike Conley, Jarred Vanderbilt and Malik Beasley all have real value around the league and all three would be worthwhile additions for Los Angeles.
Of course, everything comes to price and teams aren’t trying to do the Lakers any favors by taking on Westbrook.

     Lakers trade rumors: Jazz showing interest in Russell Westbrook; will Raptors also join sweepstakes?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But until something is solidified, here are the latest trade rumors surrounding the Lakers.
Jazz interested in Russell WestbrookUtah has seemingly been attached to every player on the trade market this season.
It's unclear what a deal between the Lakers and Jazz would look like, but Bleacher Report's Chris Haynes reports that the two sides have had "exploratory talks" regarding Westbrook.
With L.A. looking to add more shooting depth to their roster, perhaps sending Malik Beasley to L.A. in exchange for Westbrook and a future first-round pick might do the job.
His production would certainly boost this Lakers squad that ranks just 27th in the league from 3-point land.

However, the Lakers are said to be in communication with most teams to sift through the most reasonable and logical options available.
The belief within the Lakers’ organization is that they need to make at least one more move by the Feb. 9 trade deadline to give themselves a legitimate shot at competing for a championship, sources say.
Still, with the trade deadline rapidly approaching on Feb. 9, expect more reports and rumors like this as the team tries to figure out all their options.
