     Summary: The New York Islanders forward and Metropolitan Division All-Star was conducting an interview along the side boards at FLA LIVE Arena during 2023 Honda NHL All-Star Weekend when he was hit up for a common parent request: a drink.
Tweet from @NYIslanders: When dad is doing an interview but youÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩre thirsty.
ü§∑#LGI | @Enterprise pic.twitter.com/sQoLpkQYyYNelson grabbed his water bottle with his left hand and doled out the refreshment without breaking stride in his response to the reporter.
Once the request was filled, the younger Nelson was gone, back out on the ice for some more reps.From that clip it's easy to see Nelson is a father of three.
