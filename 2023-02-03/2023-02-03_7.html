     Summary: As much as Alan Jackson and George Strait are keeping it country on their most recent releases, Twain is, too.
not her best vocal performance on Queen of Me, it shows how effortlessly Twain finds the pockets her band creates.
‚ÄúI'm not a girl / I‚Äôm not a boy / I‚Äôm not a baby / I‚Äôm not a toy / I‚Äôm a queen,‚Äù Twain sings to begin the album‚Äôs signature song.
Lyrically, songs from Queen of Me are great pop songs, but thin country songs.
Her chosen co-writers are eclectic and experienced, but hard to find on any other country album.

     Summary: But as her long-awaited 2017 album Now demonstrated, Twain‚Äôs voice, affected by illness and slowly rehabilitated, has changed ‚Äî it‚Äôs deeper and more textured than when she was the undisputed queen of country pop.
And though there are a few subtle nods to that imperial phase of her career, Queen of Me doesn‚Äôt concern itself too much with her former dominance.
It feels too familiar, even if there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the songs themselves.
‚ÄúWhen will I learn?‚Äù Twain sings, still feeling the sting of a heartbreak.
You can and should take control of your life, Twain suggests on Queen of Me, long as you realize it won‚Äôt make you invincible.

Twain‚Äôs sixth studio album is her first since having open-throat surgery in 2018 to strengthen her vocal muscles after a long battle with Lyme disease.
In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Twain spoke candidly about the album, which is out Friday, regaining her confidence, singing during throat surgery and preparing for her global upcoming tour, which kicks off April 28.
But if I‚Äôm not singing for even a week or maybe two weeks, it takes me two to three days to get that voice going again.
But I go out there with the confidence that I‚Äôm the best I can be and that I‚Äôve worked hard to be my best.

     Queen of Me review | Shania Twain reborn ‚Äì whilst still reminding us of her golden era
    </h2>

     Summary: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜShania Twain, the best-selling female country artist of all time, delivers Queen of Me, the follow-up to 2017‚Äôs Now.
This self-awareness and lack of pomp make you root for Shania on her new album, Queen of Me.
It‚Äôs all wrapped up in the synth-driven swell of Taylor Swift‚Äôs Midnights and scattered with plenty of Meghan Trainor-style ‚Äúooohs‚Äù, ‚Äúheys‚Äù, ‚Äúuh uhs‚Äù, ‚Äúdo do do dos‚Äù, and ‚Äúla la la las‚Äù.
Though, of course, as Shania holds the record of being the best-selling female country artist of all time, it‚Äôs a matter of opinion on who inspired who.
Maybe‚Ä¶ but if this album proves anything, we haven‚Äôt said goodbye to the old Shania just yet.

     Summary: Shania Twain released her first studio album in 1993 ‚Äî and she‚Äôs been topping the charts ever since.
After working as a singer at a local resort, Twain landed her first record deal, and in April 1993, she released her self-titled debut album.
The record didn‚Äôt reach the commercial heights of her later work, but her music caught the attention of some country fans ‚Äî and one producer in particular.
‚ÄúMy symptoms were quite scary because before I was diagnosed, I was on stage very dizzy,‚Äù she recalled in her 2022 documentary, Shania Twain: Not Just a Girl.
Twain underwent open-throat surgery so that she could sing again, but she still hears a difference in her voice.
