     Who won the Ben Simmons for James Harden trade one year later?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been a full year since the blockbuster trade between the Brooklyn Nets and the Philadelphia 76ers that sent Ben Simmons to New York and James Harden to Philly.
One year later, let’s take a look at how this trade is looking for both sides and who seems to have won.
With that in mind, and as the 2027 pick is far in the future, the trade currently stands as Harden for Simmons, Curry, and O’Neal.
Curry and O’Neal are nice players, but NBA Championships are not won with role players they are won with All-Stars, something Harden and Simmons were both anticipated to be at the time of this trade.
Historically, that has proven to be true and in this trade, Harden is unquestionably the best player.

     Embiid's double-double keys 76ers as Spurs drop 8th straight
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Joel Embiid had 33 points and 10 rebounds and the Philadelphia 76ers beat San Antonio 137-125 on Friday night, sending the scuffling Spurs to their eighth straight loss.
San Antonio rookie Malaki Branham set a season high for the second straight game with 26 points, eclipsing his 22-point outing Wednesday in a loss to Sacramento.
Their absence contributed to San Antonio committing 18 turnovers that led to 26 points for Philadelphia.
"Giving up 26 points off turnovers makes it impossible (to win)," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.
... San Antonio has the league's second-longest active losing streak, trailing New Orleans' 10-game skid.

     Patchwork Spurs no match for Joel Embiid and the 76ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Spurs, missing three starters and a rotation player, hosted the 76ers on Friday, and the game went as expected.
Malaki Branham set a new career hight, but Joel Embiid was simply too much for San Antonio to handle.
As the second units checked in, the Spurs’ lack of depth due to injuries became even more noticeable, but the bench held on.
Philadelphia had 12 unanswered points after San Antonio had cut the deficit to just nine, and that was it.
San Antonio is normally good at keeping opponents from the charity stripe but needs to get better at getting to the line.
