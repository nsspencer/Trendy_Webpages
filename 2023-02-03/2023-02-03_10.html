     Who won the Ben Simmons for James Harden trade one year later?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been a full year since the blockbuster trade between the Brooklyn Nets and the Philadelphia 76ers that sent Ben Simmons to New York and James Harden to Philly.
One year later, let’s take a look at how this trade is looking for both sides and who seems to have won.
With that in mind, and as the 2027 pick is far in the future, the trade currently stands as Harden for Simmons, Curry, and O’Neal.
Curry and O’Neal are nice players, but NBA Championships are not won with role players they are won with All-Stars, something Harden and Simmons were both anticipated to be at the time of this trade.
Historically, that has proven to be true and in this trade, Harden is unquestionably the best player.

     Summary: Read moreSAN ANTONIO — Doc Rivers said he is “shocked” that James Harden was not named an All-Star reserve Thursday night, and has called for coaches’ votes for those spots to be made public.
“I think your record should matter, I think James Harden’s numbers should matter and I do think a history of his work should matter.
This is maybe something that we should consider having coaches votes’ public.
“The most disappointing part for me,” Rivers said, “we’ve asked James Harden to sacrifice for the team, to make the team better.
The coaches’ reserve ballots, which cannot include their own players, are not released publicly.

A ten-time All-Star, Harden has been back to his best in 2022 during his first season with the Philadelphia 76ers.
In response to a question asking who the "biggest East snub" was, teammate Georges Niang tweeted: "JAMES HARDEN @JHarden13 wow."

     All-Star Reserve Joel Embiid and All-Snub James Harden lead Sixers over Spurs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This news, after Joel Embiid was snubbed of a much-deserved starting spot, could only have blasted that chip on their shoulders into a ravine.
The Spurs opened up the game on an 8-1 run, but two quick De’Anthony Melton triples settled the Sixers’ offense and reset the momentum.
The San Antonio Spurs were able to keep pace thanks to Keldon Johnson’s strong slashing and their infamously intelligent ball movement.
After Maxey led the reserve unit to balloon Philly’s lead to 21 in the fourth, San Antonio clawed their way back, taking advantage of a Sixers’ lineup that featured third-stringers Danuel House Jr. and Paul Reed.
With Harden, Embiid, Melton, and Tobias Harris back in, the Spurs stood no chance.

     Summary: In the Philadelphia 76ers’ road win over the San Antonio Spurs, the bench lineup had a great performance.
But this time, the Sixers bench unit had a huge impact thanks in large part to Tyrese Maxey.
The Sixers bench scored 67 points, just three less than the starters, in the 137-125 victory.
“That’s what I need from them,” Harden said to reporters after the Sixers win.
The Sixers bench has plenty of variations of this set, which is used mainly to get the two guards into open space where they can shoot or pass.

And for him not to be on the All-Star team when, at the time that voting went in, we were the second seed — Boston has two, Milwaukee has two, we have one.

     Summary: pic.twitter.com/fkl1kg3adQ — NBA (@NBA) February 3, 2023No James Harden.
Haliburton is a good story as a first-time All Star but Harden’s stats are slightly better despite a negligible usage rate difference.
Holiday is, of course, a better defender, so if that’s being taken into account it’s the only clear advantage he has over Harden this season.
There’s a portion of NBA fans who think Harden is “washed,” which is clearly not the case.
You can have whatever opinion you want about Harden, but it’s pretty obvious that he was snubbed this year.
