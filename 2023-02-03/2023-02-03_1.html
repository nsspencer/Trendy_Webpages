     LeBron James' quest to become all-time scoring leader has Lakers ticket prices skyrocketing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James on the cusp of becoming the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, ticket prices for the estimated game he’s going to break the record are skyrocketing.
With James averaging 30.2 points per game, fans are projecting when he is going to get the job done.
Some believe that James might need another night, making Thursday, Feb. 9 against the Milwaukee Bucks the night he breaks the record.
However, the cheapest seat in the house is higher than the Thunder game at $445.
The price for these seats is already astronomical, but it could get even higher as James and the Lakers play on Saturday night against the New Orleans Pelicans.

     Report: Lakers, Jazz have had trade discussions about 1 star player
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Report: Lakers, Jazz have had trade discussions about 1 star playerThe Los Angeles Lakers are looking into making at least one more move ahead of next Thursday’s trade deadline, and Russell Westbrook has reportedly been part of some of those discussions.
The Lakers and Utah Jazz have had exploratory trade talks centered on Westbrook, according to Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report.
They are looking into numerous trade scenarios involving players other than Westbrook and have had talks with most teams in the league.
He has been available since, but L.A. is unwilling to include a future first-round pick in any potential trade involving Westbrook.
We doubt they are desperate to trade Westbrook, especially if the move does not drastically improve their already slim title chances.

     RUMOR: Lakers had Russell Westbrook trade ‘conversations’ with Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russell Westbrook might be playing well for the Los Angeles Lakers, but that doesn’t mean that he’s safe from a potential trade.
Amid the former MVP’s Sixth Man of the Year campaign, LA is still considering a trade ahead of the NBA trade deadline.
The new bench captain role has led fans to wonder if the Lakers would still trade Russell Westbrook at the deadline.
Still, there’s an argument to be made that a potential Westbrook trade might do more harm than good.
If not, though… these Russell Westbrook trade rumors will just grow louder and louder.

     Lakers, Jazz have had exploratory talks about Russell Westbrook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers and Jazz have had some exploratory discussions about a trade involving veteran point guard Russell Westbrook, league sources tell Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report.
It’s possible such a move could involve Westbrook, though Patrick Beverley remains a trade candidate as well.
According to Haynes, the Lakers are in communication with many teams around the NBA as they consider the most favorable trade scenarios available to them.
This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about the Lakers and Jazz having a conversation about Westbrook.
Westbrook’s $47M+ cap hit makes him a tricky player to move, but if the Lakers remain open to dealing him, there are other possibilities they could explore.
