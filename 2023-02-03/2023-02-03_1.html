     Lakers, Jazz Have Had Exploratory Talks About Westbrook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers and Jazz have had some exploratory discussions about a trade involving veteran point guard Russell Westbrook, league sources tell Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report.
It’s possible such a move could involve Westbrook, though Patrick Beverley remains a trade candidate as well.
According to Haynes, the Lakers are in communication with many teams around the NBA as they consider the most favorable trade scenarios available to them.
This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about the Lakers and Jazz having a conversation about Westbrook.
Westbrook’s $47MM+ cap hit makes him a tricky player to move, but if the Lakers remain open to dealing him, there are other possibilities they could explore.

     Kyrie Irving trade rumors: Lakers, Suns and Mavericks emerge as landing spots (report)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The next six days until the Feb. 9 trade deadline got a lot more interest after Kyrie Irving delivered a trade ultimatum to the Nets.
Irving told the organization the Nets can either trade him or he plans to leave this summer as a free agent.
The Athletic’s Shams Charania reported that the Lakers, Mavericks and Suns have emerged as “potential suitors” for Irving.
Irving could reunite with LeBron James in Los Angeles as the Lakers are looking to make a playoff push.
Irving has backtracked on a Nets trade request before, but the timing of this move is plenty intriguing.

The answer to this dilemma is a Kyrie Irving trade.
It’s also a Kyrie Irving trade that could actually improve the Nets this season.

     Three trade proposals to get Kyrie Irving to Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving shocked the NBA world on Friday when he requested a trade from his squad ahead of the NBA's Feb. 9 trade deadline.
The two sides were unable to reach an agreement on extension talks, and now, with just six days to go until the trade deadline, Irving wants out.
The Nets will have to very quickly scour the trade market, as they try to trade one of the league's top point guards.
Fortunately, they likely already have some initial frameworks for a deal, as they were discussing trades involving Irving all offseason long.
These are the three simplest moves for L.A. to get Irving on their squad.

     Lakers trade rumors: Kyrie Irving has interest in rejoining LeBron James; Russell Westbrook market takes shape
    </h2>

     Summary: But until something is solidified, here are the latest trade rumors surrounding the Lakers.
The never-ending Kyrie Irving saga started a new chapter on Friday when the Nets guard submitted a trade request ahead of next week's deadline.
That should reignite the Russell Westbrook-Irving trade possibility, which was discussed heavily last summer.
Jazz interested in Russell WestbrookUtah has seemingly been attached to every player on the trade market this season.
With L.A. looking to add more shooting depth to their roster, perhaps sending Malik Beasley to L.A. in exchange for Westbrook and a future first-round pick might do the job.
