     Kyrie Irving insulted by Nets putting 'championship stipulation' in contract offer, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to Bleacher Report's Chris Haynes, the Nets recently offered Irving a contract extension that included a championship stipulation, and Irving took that as "a big insult."
You can listen to Haynes' full NBA TV segment here:Haynes didn't provide any clarity on what, exactly, this "championship stipulation" entailed.
Reports earlier in the day indicated that Irving wasn't happy with the final year of Brooklyn's proposed contract not being guaranteed.
Might that final year become guaranteed if the Nets were to win a title between now and then?
Whatever the stipulation, Irving views himself as a caliber of player that shouldn't have to mess with non-guaranteed years on a contract.

     Summary: Which means the next move would likely be to trade superstar Kevin Durant, currently injured, for another package of picks and assets to jump-start the rebuild.
Play Fantasy WNBA Basketball The 2023 Women's Fantasy Basketball season has officially arrived!
But... if Kyrie and Durant were gone and the Nets therefore had zero expectations, in a rebuild, might he start to find his groove again?

Thomas is rostered in only the deepest of leagues, so you could pick him up now and see what happens.
