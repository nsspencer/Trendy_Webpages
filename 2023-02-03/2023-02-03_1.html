     Lakers trade rumors: Kyrie Irving has interest in rejoining LeBron James; Russell Westbrook market takes shape
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But until something is solidified, here are the latest trade rumors surrounding the Lakers.
The never-ending Kyrie Irving saga started a new chapter on Friday when the Nets guard submitted a trade request ahead of next week's deadline.
That should reignite the Russell Westbrook-Irving trade possibility, which was discussed heavily last summer.
Jazz interested in Russell WestbrookUtah has seemingly been attached to every player on the trade market this season.
With L.A. looking to add more shooting depth to their roster, perhaps sending Malik Beasley to L.A. in exchange for Westbrook and a future first-round pick might do the job.

     Summary: The Lakers and Mavericks are among the teams expected to talk to the Nets before next Thursday’s trade deadline about a possible deal involving Kyrie Irving, according to veteran NBA reporter Marc Stein (Twitter link).
In addition to the Lakers and Mavs, the Suns have emerged as a potential suitor for Irving, sources tell Shams Charania of The Athletic (Twitter link).
There are a handful of reasons why the list of obvious matches for Irving isn’t lengthy.
According to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski (Twitter link), Irving hasn’t given the Nets a list of preferred landing spots, but his interest in the Lakers has carried over from the 2022 offseason.
When Irving explored the possibility of changing teams last summer, the Lakers, Mavericks, and Heat were said to be on his wish list, along with the Clippers, Knicks, and Sixers.
