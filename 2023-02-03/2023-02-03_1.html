     4 Kyrie Irving trade ideas with Lakers, Suns, Heat, and Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Kyrie Irving has again decided he wants to be traded from the Brooklyn Nets.
Lakers potential trade package for Kyrie IrvingA Nets-Lakers trade built around swapping Russell Westbrook and future draft picks for Irving will be the one everyone is talking about.
Heat potential trade package for Kyrie IrvingThe Heat make plenty of sense as an Irving suitor.
Mavericks potential trade package for Kyrie IrvingThe Mavericks desperately need a co-star next to Luka Doncic after losing Jalen Brunson to the Knicks in free agency.
Suns potential trade package for Kyrie IrvingThe Suns were in the NBA Finals just two years ago, but they risk falling out of relevancy in the West with Chris Paul getting older.

     Summary: A week removed from being voted a starter in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, mercurial Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving has requested a trade, preferably before next week's deadline, according to multiple reports.

Story continuesBrooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving reportedly wants off the team prior to next week's trade deadline.
(Sarah Stier/Getty Images)The request comes seven months after Durant presented his own trade ultimatum to the Nets — trade him or fire both then-head coach Steve Nash and general manager Sean Marks.
Durant's demand came on the heels of Brooklyn granting Irving permission to seek a sign-and-trade deal that never materialized in June.
