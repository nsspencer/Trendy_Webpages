     RUMOR: Lakers had Russell Westbrook trade ‘conversations’ with Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russell Westbrook might be playing well for the Los Angeles Lakers, but that doesn’t mean that he’s safe from a potential trade.
Amid the former MVP’s Sixth Man of the Year campaign, LA is still considering a trade ahead of the NBA trade deadline.
The new bench captain role has led fans to wonder if the Lakers would still trade Russell Westbrook at the deadline.
Still, there’s an argument to be made that a potential Westbrook trade might do more harm than good.
If not, though… these Russell Westbrook trade rumors will just grow louder and louder.

     Lakers, Jazz Have Had Exploratory Talks About Westbrook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers and Jazz have had some exploratory discussions about a trade involving veteran point guard Russell Westbrook, league sources tell Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report.
It’s possible such a move could involve Westbrook, though Patrick Beverley remains a trade candidate as well.
According to Haynes, the Lakers are in communication with many teams around the NBA as they consider the most favorable trade scenarios available to them.
This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about the Lakers and Jazz having a conversation about Westbrook.
Westbrook’s $47MM+ cap hit makes him a tricky player to move, but if the Lakers remain open to dealing him, there are other possibilities they could explore.

     Kyrie Irving's Trade Request Has NBA Twitter Eying LeBron James Reunion with Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE via Getty ImagesBrooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving reportedly requested a trade Friday, which has NBA Twitter buzzing about a possible reunion between Kyrie and LeBron James with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium reported Friday that Irving asked the Nets for a trade and told them he wants to be moved before Thursday's trade deadline.
Assuming the Nets accommodate Irving and trade him before Feb. 9, many seemingly want and expect the Lakers to be the primary suitor.
Because of that, the Lakers don't have a first-round pick without conditions attached until 2027.
LeBron and Kyrie played together for three seasons in Cleveland, reaching three NBA Finals and winning one championship.

     Summary: But until something is solidified, here are the latest trade rumors surrounding the Lakers.
The never-ending Kyrie Irving saga started a new chapter on Friday when the Nets guard submitted a trade request ahead of next week's deadline.
That should reignite the Russell Westbrook-Irving trade possibility, which was discussed heavily last summer.
Jazz interested in Russell WestbrookUtah has seemingly been attached to every player on the trade market this season.
With L.A. looking to add more shooting depth to their roster, perhaps sending Malik Beasley to L.A. in exchange for Westbrook and a future first-round pick might do the job.
