     RUMOR: Lakers had Russell Westbrook trade ‘conversations’ with Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Russell Westbrook might be playing well for the Los Angeles Lakers, but that doesn’t mean that he’s safe from a potential trade.
Amid the former MVP’s Sixth Man of the Year campaign, LA is still considering a trade ahead of the NBA trade deadline.
The new bench captain role has led fans to wonder if the Lakers would still trade Russell Westbrook at the deadline.
Still, there’s an argument to be made that a potential Westbrook trade might do more harm than good.
If not, though… these Russell Westbrook trade rumors will just grow louder and louder.

     Lakers, Jazz Have Had Exploratory Talks About Westbrook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers and Jazz have had some exploratory discussions about a trade involving veteran point guard Russell Westbrook, league sources tell Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report.
It’s possible such a move could involve Westbrook, though Patrick Beverley remains a trade candidate as well.
According to Haynes, the Lakers are in communication with many teams around the NBA as they consider the most favorable trade scenarios available to them.
This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about the Lakers and Jazz having a conversation about Westbrook.
Westbrook’s $47MM+ cap hit makes him a tricky player to move, but if the Lakers remain open to dealing him, there are other possibilities they could explore.
