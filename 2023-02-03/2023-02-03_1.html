     NEW: James closes in on scoring mark as Lakers rally past Pacers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As much as LeBron James’ march toward the NBA’s all-time scoring mark might have captured people’s attention outside of the Los Angeles Lakers, James’ goal for this season is to get back into the playoffs whether he scored five or 5,000 points.
James’ 26 points in Friday morning’s 112-111 win over the Indiana Pacers pulled him within 63 points of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s record.
However, the victory itself, which brought the Lakers just one game out of the final play-in spot, seemed more significant.
“I think it’s an amazing feat,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said of the scoring record.
'”Ultimately, honors and accomplishments like All-Star nods and scoring feats are secondary when it comes to winning.

     LeBron James' quest to become all-time scoring leader has Lakers ticket prices skyrocketing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James on the cusp of becoming the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, ticket prices for the estimated game he’s going to break the record are skyrocketing.
James needs just 63 more points to break Lakers legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s record of 38,387 following his 26-point performance against the Indiana Pacers on Thursday night.
With James averaging 30.2 points per game, fans are projecting when he is going to get the job done.
However, the cheapest seat in the house is higher than the Thunder game at $445.
The price for these seats is already astronomical, but it could get even higher as James and the Lakers play on Saturday night against the New Orleans Pelicans.
