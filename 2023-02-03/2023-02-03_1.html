     Magic Johnson Would 'Love' to See Kyrie Irving with Lakers After Nets Trade Request
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Matteo Marchi/Getty ImagesLos Angeles Lakers legend and Basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson threw his support behind the idea of the Lakers acquiring All-Star guard Kyrie Irving from the Brooklyn Nets on Friday.
Charania followed up with a report that the Lakers, Phoenix Suns and Dallas Mavericks have emerged as potential suitors for Kyrie.
On the court, Irving is enjoying an excellent 2022-23 season, as he was selected an All-Star starter, making him an eight-time All-Star.
Thus, the Lakers are expected to be active at the trade deadline in an attempt to add quality pieces around LeBron and Davis.
Irving would be an ideal addition, but it is unclear if the Lakers have the ammo needed to make it happen.

     Lakers trade rumors: Kyrie Irving has interest in rejoining LeBron James; Russell Westbrook market takes shape
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But until something is solidified, here are the latest trade rumors surrounding the Lakers.
The never-ending Kyrie Irving saga started a new chapter on Friday when the Nets guard submitted a trade request ahead of next week's deadline.
That should reignite the Russell Westbrook-Irving trade possibility, which was discussed heavily last summer.
Jazz interested in Russell WestbrookUtah has seemingly been attached to every player on the trade market this season.
With L.A. looking to add more shooting depth to their roster, perhaps sending Malik Beasley to L.A. in exchange for Westbrook and a future first-round pick might do the job.

     Summary: Eddie House: Kyrie Irving would make Lakers a contender originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonKyrie Irving's trade request could have significant ramifications in the Western Conference.
His trade request actually came just a few days after the Nets and Lakers faced off, and our Eddie House doesn't believe that's a coincidence.
Because if he comes to the Lakers, the Lakers go from being a bottom-tier team in the West to actually becoming a contender."
If the Lakers land Irving, House says health will determine their fate.
It's expected that for the Lakers to acquire Irving, Russell Westbrook would be included in an outgoing trade package.
