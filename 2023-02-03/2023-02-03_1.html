     Phoenix Suns emerge as potential suitors for Nets' Kyrie Irving, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Lakers and Dallas Mavericks have emerged as potential suitors to acquire Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving, per The Athletic’s Shams Charania.
The reports come after Irving requested a trade on Friday, according to multiple reports.
The influx of news has quickly given what looked like a sleepy trade season a sudden jolt of life.
The Lakers and Irving were linked in the offseason when both Irving and Durant looked likely to find new homes then.
Durant is currently out to rest an MCL sprain that will cost him at least another week on the sidelines.

     Kyrie Irving asks Nets for trade ahead of deadline
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After failing to negotiate terms on a long-term contract extension with the organization, Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving has issued a trade request, sources told ESPN on Friday.
Irving, who will become a free agent this summer, wants out ahead of Thursday's NBA trade deadline.
If Irving is traded, he is eligible to sign a two-year $78.6 million extension with his new team until June 30.
Shifting the Odds News of Kyrie Irving's trade request shifted the Nets title odds from +600 to +1200 at Caesars Sportsbook.
The bigger issue for Brooklyn becomes how All-NBA star Kevin Durant responds to Irving's trade request, and if it causes him to rethink his future with the organization ahead of Thursday's deadline.

     AP source: Kyrie Irving requests trade from Nets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NEW YORK — (AP) — Unable to get a new contract, Kyrie Irving is looking for a new address.
The All-Star guard has asked the Brooklyn Nets for a trade, a person with knowledge of the details said Friday.
Irving is eligible for a contract extension, but the Nets refused to give him one last summer.
Irving’s agent and stepmother, Shetellia Irving, told Bleacher Report last week that she had reached out to the Nets regarding a new deal.
Kyrie Irving — whose current deal with the Nets expires after this season — is eligible for a four-year contract worth as much as $200 million.
