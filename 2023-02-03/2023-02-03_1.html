     Three trade proposals to get Kyrie Irving to Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving shocked the NBA world on Friday when he requested a trade from his squad ahead of the NBA's Feb. 9 trade deadline.
The two sides were unable to reach an agreement on extension talks, and now, with just six days to go until the trade deadline, Irving wants out.
The Nets will have to very quickly scour the trade market, as they try to trade one of the league's top point guards.
Fortunately, they likely already have some initial frameworks for a deal, as they were discussing trades involving Irving all offseason long.
These are the three simplest moves for L.A. to get Irving on their squad.

     Kyrie Irving's Trade Request Has NBA Twitter Eying LeBron James Reunion with Lakers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE via Getty ImagesBrooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving reportedly requested a trade Friday, which has NBA Twitter buzzing about a possible reunion between Kyrie and LeBron James with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium reported Friday that Irving asked the Nets for a trade and told them he wants to be moved before Thursday's trade deadline.
Assuming the Nets accommodate Irving and trade him before Feb. 9, many seemingly want and expect the Lakers to be the primary suitor.
Because of that, the Lakers don't have a first-round pick without conditions attached until 2027.
LeBron and Kyrie played together for three seasons in Cleveland, reaching three NBA Finals and winning one championship.

     Why Lakers must not trade for Kyrie Irving despite LeBron James’ desires
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is the query the Los Angeles Lakers need to consider as they weigh a trade for Kyrie Irving, who requested out from the Brooklyn Nets on Friday.
We know what side LeBron James (and Magic Johnson) lands on.
LeBron is always star-hunting and wants the Lakers to aggressively trade draft picks to upgrade the roster before the Feb. 9 trade deadline.
The Lakers &amp; Mavericks are among the teams expected to take part in Kyrie Irving trade talks, per @TheSteinLinehttps://t.co/K0EB3HSaiH — ClutchPoints (@ClutchPointsApp) February 3, 2023Kyrie Irving is an other-worldly talent on the basketball court.
There’s just literally zero indication that 2023 Kyrie Irving can be relied upon, like at all, in any fashion, for more than a few months.

     Lakers, Jazz Have Had Exploratory Talks About Westbrook
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Lakers and Jazz have had some exploratory discussions about a trade involving veteran point guard Russell Westbrook, league sources tell Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report.
It’s possible such a move could involve Westbrook, though Patrick Beverley remains a trade candidate as well.
According to Haynes, the Lakers are in communication with many teams around the NBA as they consider the most favorable trade scenarios available to them.
This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about the Lakers and Jazz having a conversation about Westbrook.
Westbrook’s $47MM+ cap hit makes him a tricky player to move, but if the Lakers remain open to dealing him, there are other possibilities they could explore.

     Lakers trade rumors: Kyrie Irving has interest in rejoining LeBron James; Russell Westbrook market takes shape
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But until something is solidified, here are the latest trade rumors surrounding the Lakers.
The never-ending Kyrie Irving saga started a new chapter on Friday when the Nets guard submitted a trade request ahead of next week's deadline.
That should reignite the Russell Westbrook-Irving trade possibility, which was discussed heavily last summer.
Jazz interested in Russell WestbrookUtah has seemingly been attached to every player on the trade market this season.
With L.A. looking to add more shooting depth to their roster, perhaps sending Malik Beasley to L.A. in exchange for Westbrook and a future first-round pick might do the job.
