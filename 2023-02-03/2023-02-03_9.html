     BREAKING: Tommy Rees Expected to be named Offensive Coordinator at Alabama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sources have informed Irish Illustrated and 247Sports that current offensive coordinator Tommy Rees is leaving the Notre Dame Fighting Irish for the same role with the Alabama Crimson Tide.
Notre Dame head coach Marcus Freeman is now in search of a new offensive coordinator, while Alabama head coach Nick Saban replaces Bill O’Brien, who left to become the offensive coordinator for the New England Patriots.
Rees has served as the Fighting Irish's offensive coordinator since 2020 and as their quarterbacks coach since 2017.
Former Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly originally hired Rees, who stayed on staff after Marcus Freeman moved from defensive coordinator to head coach when Kelly left for LSU.
Last year it was LSU and Kelly trying to poach him away, but he once again stayed at Notre Dame.

     Alabama hires Notre Dame's Tommy Rees as offensive coordinator to replace Bill O'Brien
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nick Saban has hired Notre Dame offensive coordinator Tommy Rees to fill the same role at Alabama, according 247Sports.
Rees is Saban's fifth offensive coordinator since Lane Kiffin left to be the FAU coach prior to the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship.
At age 30, Rees is Saban's youngest coordinator since Will Muschamp as defensive coordinator at LSU in 2002.
Rees was Notre Dame's quarterbacks coach 2017-19 under former coach Brian Kelly and added the offensive coordinator role in 2020.
The news that Rees has been hired by Saban comes after after Washington offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb reportedly turned down the job to return to the Huskies.
