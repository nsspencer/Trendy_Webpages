     76ers’ James Harden unhappy with NBA All-Star Game snub
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Philadelphia 76ers star guard James Harden has been named to every All-Star Game since the 2012-2013 season, but his streak has ended.
The NBA announced the All-Star Game reserves on Thursday, and Harden, who has gone to 10 straight, was not on the roster.
Harden is averaging 21.4 points, 11 assists and 6.4 rebounds.
Harden’s 11.0 assists would be leading the NBA, however, he’s not listed among the leaders because he’s only played 56.5% of the Sixers’ contests (34).
Milwaukee Bucks’ Jrue Holiday, who is averaging 19.4 points, 7.2 assists and 5.3 rebounds per game, was also named to the reserves.

     James Harden Should be an All Star
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: pic.twitter.com/fkl1kg3adQ — NBA (@NBA) February 3, 2023No James Harden.
Haliburton is a good story as a first-time All Star but Harden’s stats are slightly better despite a negligible usage rate difference.
Holiday is, of course, a better defender, so if that’s being taken into account it’s the only clear advantage he has over Harden this season.
There’s a portion of NBA fans who think Harden is “washed,” which is clearly not the case.
You can have whatever opinion you want about Harden, but it’s pretty obvious that he was snubbed this year.

     Who won the Ben Simmons for James Harden trade one year later?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It has been a full year since the blockbuster trade between the Brooklyn Nets and the Philadelphia 76ers that sent Ben Simmons to New York and James Harden to Philly.
One year later, let’s take a look at how this trade is looking for both sides and who seems to have won.
With that in mind, and as the 2027 pick is far in the future, the trade currently stands as Harden for Simmons, Curry, and O’Neal.
Curry and O’Neal are nice players, but NBA Championships are not won with role players they are won with All-Stars, something Harden and Simmons were both anticipated to be at the time of this trade.
Historically, that has proven to be true and in this trade, Harden is unquestionably the best player.
