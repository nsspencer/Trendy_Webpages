     Shania Twain Kickstarts Empowering 'Queen Of Me' Era: 'Absolutely Thrilled'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Twain is no stranger to making huge leaps and strides in preparation to plunge into her Queen of Me era in full confidence.
Twain powered through her boundaries in an effort to “be more relaxed and comfortable in my own skin.
“These days, I'm feeling very comfortable in my own skin - and I think this album reflects that musically,” Twain said when she announced her album and tour in October.
“I want to celebrate this new chapter with you all on my tour!” Twain continued.
“I’ll be Queen Of Me – you be Queen of YOU!

     Queen of Me review | Shania Twain reborn – whilst still reminding us of her golden era
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ★★★☆☆Shania Twain, the best-selling female country artist of all time, delivers Queen of Me, the follow-up to 2017’s Now.
This self-awareness and lack of pomp make you root for Shania on her new album, Queen of Me.
It’s all wrapped up in the synth-driven swell of Taylor Swift’s Midnights and scattered with plenty of Meghan Trainor-style “ooohs”, “heys”, “uh uhs”, “do do do dos”, and “la la la las”.
Though, of course, as Shania holds the record of being the best-selling female country artist of all time, it’s a matter of opinion on who inspired who.
Maybe… but if this album proves anything, we haven’t said goodbye to the old Shania just yet.

     Q&amp;A: Shania Twain talks rebuilding confidence with new album
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LOS ANGELES — (AP) — Shania Twain felt the need on her new album to empower herself the same way she has uplifted listeners with hits like “Man!
Twain’s sixth studio album is her first since having open-throat surgery in 2018 to strengthen her vocal muscles after a long battle with Lyme disease.
In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Twain spoke candidly about the album, which is out Friday, regaining her confidence, singing during throat surgery and preparing for her global upcoming tour, which kicks off April 28.
But if I’m not singing for even a week or maybe two weeks, it takes me two to three days to get that voice going again.
But I go out there with the confidence that I’m the best I can be and that I’ve worked hard to be my best.

     Shania Twain Feels Like A New Woman On ‘Queen of Me’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But as her long-awaited 2017 album Now demonstrated, Twain’s voice, affected by illness and slowly rehabilitated, has changed — it’s deeper and more textured than when she was the undisputed queen of country pop.
And though there are a few subtle nods to that imperial phase of her career, Queen of Me doesn’t concern itself too much with her former dominance.
It feels too familiar, even if there’s nothing wrong with the songs themselves.
“When will I learn?” Twain sings, still feeling the sting of a heartbreak.
You can and should take control of your life, Twain suggests on Queen of Me, long as you realize it won’t make you invincible.

     Shania Twain Through the Years: Country Superstardom, Motherhood and More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shania Twain released her first studio album in 1993 — and she’s been topping the charts ever since.
After working as a singer at a local resort, Twain landed her first record deal, and in April 1993, she released her self-titled debut album.
The record didn’t reach the commercial heights of her later work, but her music caught the attention of some country fans — and one producer in particular.
“My symptoms were quite scary because before I was diagnosed, I was on stage very dizzy,” she recalled in her 2022 documentary, Shania Twain: Not Just a Girl.
Twain underwent open-throat surgery so that she could sing again, but she still hears a difference in her voice.
