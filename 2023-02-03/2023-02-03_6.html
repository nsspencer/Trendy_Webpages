     Shania Twain Celebrates Being The ‘Queen Of Me’ On Her New Album
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shania Twain | Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Getty ImagesGrammy-winning country star Shania Twain has spent much of the past decade extending her legacy built in the 1990s and early 2000s, returning in 2017 with Now, her first new album since her 2002 Diamond-certified LP Up!.
Today, Twain is back with her sixth studio album Queen of Me, a record that, much like Now, is an expression of where Twain is at this point in her life and her career.
In the lead-up to the album’s release, Twain has spoken openly about finding confidence in herself and her outward appearance as she continues to age.
“I’m feeling quite liberated in so many ways,” Twain told Hoda Kotb on the Making Space podcast.
For Twain, putting this album together during the pandemic helped her get through a difficult time — and have some fun in the process.

     Review: Shania Twain Is the Woman You Remember Across Queen of Me
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As much as Alan Jackson and George Strait are keeping it country on their most recent releases, Twain is, too.
not her best vocal performance on Queen of Me, it shows how effortlessly Twain finds the pockets her band creates.
“I'm not a girl / I’m not a boy / I’m not a baby / I’m not a toy / I’m a queen,” Twain sings to begin the album’s signature song.
Lyrically, songs from Queen of Me are great pop songs, but thin country songs.
Her chosen co-writers are eclectic and experienced, but hard to find on any other country album.

     Queen of Me review | Shania Twain reborn – whilst still reminding us of her golden era
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ★★★☆☆Shania Twain, the best-selling female country artist of all time, delivers Queen of Me, the follow-up to 2017’s Now.
This self-awareness and lack of pomp make you root for Shania on her new album, Queen of Me.
It’s all wrapped up in the synth-driven swell of Taylor Swift’s Midnights and scattered with plenty of Meghan Trainor-style “ooohs”, “heys”, “uh uhs”, “do do do dos”, and “la la la las”.
Though, of course, as Shania holds the record of being the best-selling female country artist of all time, it’s a matter of opinion on who inspired who.
Maybe… but if this album proves anything, we haven’t said goodbye to the old Shania just yet.

     Shania Twain Through the Years: Country Superstardom, Motherhood and More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shania Twain released her first studio album in 1993 — and she’s been topping the charts ever since.
After working as a singer at a local resort, Twain landed her first record deal, and in April 1993, she released her self-titled debut album.
The record didn’t reach the commercial heights of her later work, but her music caught the attention of some country fans — and one producer in particular.
“My symptoms were quite scary because before I was diagnosed, I was on stage very dizzy,” she recalled in her 2022 documentary, Shania Twain: Not Just a Girl.
Twain underwent open-throat surgery so that she could sing again, but she still hears a difference in her voice.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But as her long-awaited 2017 album Now demonstrated, Twain’s voice, affected by illness and slowly rehabilitated, has changed — it’s deeper and more textured than when she was the undisputed queen of country pop.
And though there are a few subtle nods to that imperial phase of her career, Queen of Me doesn’t concern itself too much with her former dominance.
It feels too familiar, even if there’s nothing wrong with the songs themselves.
“When will I learn?” Twain sings, still feeling the sting of a heartbreak.
You can and should take control of your life, Twain suggests on Queen of Me, long as you realize it won’t make you invincible.

     Summary: LOS ANGELES — (AP) — Shania Twain felt the need on her new album to empower herself the same way she has uplifted listeners with hits like “Man!
Twain’s sixth studio album is her first since having open-throat surgery in 2018 to strengthen her vocal muscles after a long battle with Lyme disease.
In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Twain spoke candidly about the album, which is out Friday, regaining her confidence, singing during throat surgery and preparing for her global upcoming tour, which kicks off April 28.
But if I’m not singing for even a week or maybe two weeks, it takes me two to three days to get that voice going again.
But I go out there with the confidence that I’m the best I can be and that I’ve worked hard to be my best.
