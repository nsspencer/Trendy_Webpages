     Derek Carr pokes fun at Raiders after winning precision passing competition in Pro Bowl skills challenge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Soon-to-be former Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr was a late addition to the AFC Pro Bowl roster as a replacement, giving him one more shot to toss the pigskin around in Sin City.
The Pro Bowl skills competition kicked off on Thursday night with the precision passing drill, and AFC coach Peyton Manning made the wise decision to have Carr throw third after Trevor Lawrence and Tyler Huntley.
Carr scored 31 total points, lifting the AFC side to victory.
Following the victory, Carr spoke with ESPN's Ryan Clark, who asked him if he had ever been that hot in Las Vegas.
36 overall pick out of Fresno State likely leaves the Raiders as their all-time passing leader (35,222 yards), all-time passing touchdowns leader (217) and second in wins (63).

Even after the retirement of Tom Brady, the 2023 veteran quarterback market promises to be as strong as it has been in years.
The Indianapolis Colts will likely have their eye on a half-dozen potential difference-makers, including Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr.
Colts fans eyeing that level of high-end quarterback play were treated to a delightful exhibition of his talent last night in Las Vegas.

Now, the Raiders have granted Carr permission to speak with teams who are possibly interested in trading for him, according to Adam Schefter.
However, there is a caveat to Las Vegas' decision to let Carr speak with inquiring teams.
The report notes that those interested clubs will also need to have agreed to compensation with the Raiders before speaking with Carr.

     QB-Needy Teams Expecting Raiders To Release Derek Carr
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 10:54am: From what has become an alternate-heavy Pro Bowl Games in Las Vegas, Derek Carr addressed his unusual situation with the Raiders.
As of now, quarterback-needy teams are expecting the Raiders to release Carr, Jeff Howe of The Athletic notes (subscription required).
“That’s for [the Raiders] to talk about,” Carr said when asked about the Raiders’ refusal to permit talks with other teams.
Still, second-year Raiders GM Dave Ziegler said during a SiriusXM Radio interview (via NFL.com) he expects teams to begin contacting him on a Carr trade.
The Commanders attempted to engage the Raiders in Carr trade talks last year, and they are open to adding a veteran yet again.

     Howe: What I’m hearing about Raiders’ troubles trying to trade Derek Carr
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So after speaking with numerous team and league officials, granted anonymity to speak freely, here’s a rundown of what I’m hearing:• A resolution is looming with Raiders quarterback Derek Carr, as $40.4 million of his contract will become fully guaranteed Feb. 15.
The Raiders will almost certainly trade or release Carr by that deadline, and quarterback-needy teams believe a release is the more likely scenario.
The Raiders have very little leverage because Carr has a no-trade clause, and interested teams believe they can sign Carr for a more favorable contract than the one they’d have to trade to inherit.
GO DEEPER Tafur: Tom Brady wasn't a great plan for Raiders, but where do they go now?
Essentially, it sounds like teams aren’t going to be lining up to trade for the current contract.
