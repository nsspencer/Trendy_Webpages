     Summary: What: Phoenix Suns (27-26) vs. Boston Celtics (37-15)When: 5:30 PM AZ TimeWhere: TD Garden, Boston, MAWatch: Bally Sports Arizona, NBATVListen: 98.7 FMThe Phoenix Suns will be traveling cross country to start a five-game east coast road trip, the first of which coming against the league-best Boston Celtics.
The Suns are winners of six of their last eight games, but coming off a perplexing loss to the Atlanta Hawks.
Meanwhile, the Celtics are 4-3 over the last two weeks and are coming off a blowout home win over the Brooklyn Nets.
Suns NotesThe Suns, while coming off of a (very) subpar showing against Atlanta, still are tied for the best record over the last two weeks, at 6-2.
PredictionThe Suns will right their wrongs, and add another timestamp in their (re)ascension with a gritty and prideful win in Boston.
