     Apple TV+'s New Weeper Dear Edward Is Hardly Good Grief
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two hundred-plus lives aboard are lost, save for one: 12-year-old Edward (newcomer Colin O’Brien), who lost his entire family—including his older brother and best friend Jordan (Maxwell Jenkins)—in the crash.
But life isn’t that easy; Plus, everyone’s got deep wounds in need of healing, some inflicted long before the crash.
After all, hundreds of others died on that flight, all with loved ones rummaging through their emotional wreckage.
There’s Connie Britton’s brash New Jersey empty nester Dee Dee, Anna Uzele’s AOC-lite political hopeful Adriana, Amy Forsyth’s Linda, a pregnant teen whose boyfriend died in the crash.
Still, others crumble under the secrets and lies left behind by spouses who aren’t around to guard them anymore.

     Summary: Here’s a tip: Maybe don’t watch Dear Edward if you’re traveling by plane any time soon.
He must contend with a sort of macabre celebrity status thanks to the deluge of strangers that write to him (hence, Dear Edward) while navigating tweenhood with his aunt and uncle as his guides.
Schilling has had her own fair share of near-death experiences, she tells StyleCaster during the press junket for Dear Edward.
And I think Lacey does that with a lot of bravery.
Dear Edward is on AppleTV+ with new episodes airing every Friday.

     ‘Dear Edward’ shows tears, laughter of those reeling from a plane crash — including the boy who survived it
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the media swarming around, Edward — aka “Miracle Boy” — moves to the upstate New York home of his Aunt Lacey (Taylor Schilling) and Uncle John (Carter Hudson).
Edward withdraws into himself while Lacey and John struggle mightily to connect with him.
Connie Britton plays a privileged chatterbox learning some shocking truths about her husband, a plane crash casualty.
The gimmick of having Edward talking to his older brother Jordan (Maxwell Jenkins) as if Jordan is still there by his side is more unsettling than dramatically effective.
Still, there are beautifully rendered scenes involving Edward and Lacey, and Edward and his new best friend, a roller-skating dynamo and fellow “weirdo” named Shay (Eva Ariel Binder).

This connection happened during the production of Dear Edward, a series focused on Edward Adler, a 12-year-old boy who survives a devastating commercial plane crash that kills every other passenger on the flight, including his own family.
I would just think things through.
Explaining how the two established a believable connection, Schilling and O’Brien admit that they didn’t exactly discuss any acting techniques.

     'Dear Edward' review: Producer Jason Katims builds a story of resilience around a fatal plane crash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Intended to be uplifting, the Apple TV+ show is too much of a bummer to wholly recommend boarding this flight.
Colin O'Brien and Taylor Schilling in the Apple TV+ series "Dear Edward."
It’s possible, in other words, to see “Dear Edward” as being meticulously executed and occasionally quite affecting, and still come away feeling as if it’s simply not worth the effort.
With apologies to that aforementioned Katims series, it’s an instance where a series with admirable intentions – graced with clear eyes and full hearts – actually can lose.

     Dear Edward Recap: The Odd and Peculiar
    </h2>

     Summary: Britton is living it up as the sometimes ridiculous, often out of touch, always entitled Dee Dee, and we are all privileged to witness it.
Dee Dee talks about how when she and Charles met, they had nothing but each other.
Dee Dee and Linda end up at the Wreck Room — which Dee Dee originally believed was a “depraved sex club” Charles was using to cheat on her but is actually one of those places where you’re allowed to smash and break things for cathartic reasons — and they smash the hell out of some shit.
It’s nice to see Dee Dee and Linda bonding outside of group (though Dee Dee really had to be worn down, didn’t she?
