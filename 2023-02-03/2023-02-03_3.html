     Fernandez debut fizzles as Chelsea held by Fulham to 0-0
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (AP) — Enzo Fernandez’s debut for Chelsea fizzled out as Fulham earned a worthy 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge in the English Premier League on Friday.
Chelsea was left stranded in ninth and its indifferent form was extended to one win in six in the league.
Fulham proved it was not necessary to spend 315 million pounds ($380 million) in the January transfer window to sit in the upper reaches of the top-flight.
Marco Silva’s well-drilled team made the host look toothless at times at the end of a week in which it spent 106.5 million pounds to land World Cup winner Fernandez.
The second half continued in a vein in which Fulham more than held its own against the host’s expensive assemble.

     Mudryk, Fernandez and Joao Felix included in Chelsea Champions League squad with Aubameyang and other signings left out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mykhailo Mudryk, Enzo Fernandez and Joao Felix have all been added to Chelsea’s Champions League for the latter stages of the competition, while Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been left out to make space.
David Datro Fofana, Noni Madueke, Andrey Santos, Gabriel Slonina and Benoit Badiashile have also been left out of Graham Potter’s 25-man European squad.
Chelsea had registered a 24-man squad for the group stages of the Champions League.
Since the 2018-19 season, there has not been a ‘cup-tied’ rule in the Champions League — meaning Mudryk (Shakhtar), Fernandez (Benfica) and Felix (Atletico) were all eligible to be registered despite featuring in the group stages for other teams.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Chelsea signing Enzo Fernandez gives his first interview since joining the club in a record-breaking deal from Benfica.
(1:15)Benfica president Rui Costa has hit out at Enzo Fernandez for his behaviour before leaving the club to join Chelsea for a British record fee.
Chelsea signed the Argentina international on transfer deadline day from Benfica after meeting the midfielder's €121 million release clause.
Enzo Fernandez signed for Chelsea on a British record £106 million on deadline day.
Rui Costa, nevertheless, said he respects Fernandez's decision.

Mykhailo Mudryk also made his full debut for Graham Potter's side, while Reece James returned from injury to make his first appearance since December 27.
Mudryk was removed as the second half began, replaced by another new signing making his club debut, Noni Madueke.
The second half saw more opportunities for each side, but no breakthrough.
Both sides moved up one place in the table for the time being - Fulham to sixth and Chelsea to ninth.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "That bit of connection, that bit of fluidity, that bit of understanding that you need, we lacked a little bit."
Chelsea are currently nine points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester United who have a game in hand.
Fulham boss Marco Silva praised his team, who beat Chelsea 2-1 at Craven Cottage in January.
Rather than worry about Chelsea's new-look squad, he said Fulham made sure they maintained the form that has propelled them to sixth in the table.
"Our focus to be honest is on ourselves ... and what we can do as a team," the Portuguese coach said.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fact the game went goalless -- their third in their past six Premier League games -- summed up their season so far.
Chelsea fans did get a first glimpse at Enzo Fernandez, the new Premier League record signee who arrived in the final minutes of Tuesday's transfer deadline day.
They also have netted the fewest goals (22) in the Premier League top 10, and it's not close.
Fulham fans are wrong -- for a start, there are three Premier League sides in west London -- but Fulham remain on top of the pack.

     Havertz and Chelsea Begin Push for Top 4
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After a busy transfer window play in the Premier League returns to the pitch.
Sean Dyche was hired just a week ago to try and rescue Everton from relegation but that is old news following a flurry of activity at the tail end of the transfer window.
Highlights from the chaotic and expensive window include: Jorginho moving from Chelsea to Arsenal, Chelsea adding eight players including Enzo Fernandez, and Newcastle trying to find some offense to go with their often-impenetrable defense.
I think they have no chance at Top 4 (Chelsea is +800 to make the Top 4).…Defensively is the biggest issue.
They cannot keep the ball out of their own net.”Croucher compared the new-look Chelsea squad to Wenger's later years at Arsenal.
