    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mykhailo Mudryk, Enzo Fernandez and Joao Felix have all been added to Chelsea’s Champions League for the latter stages of the competition, while Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been left out to make space.
David Datro Fofana, Noni Madueke, Andrey Santos, Gabriel Slonina and Benoit Badiashile have also been left out of Graham Potter’s 25-man European squad.
Chelsea had registered a 24-man squad for the group stages of the Champions League.
Since the 2018-19 season, there has not been a ‘cup-tied’ rule in the Champions League — meaning Mudryk (Shakhtar), Fernandez (Benfica) and Felix (Atletico) were all eligible to be registered despite featuring in the group stages for other teams.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON -- Chelsea head coach Graham Potter has said he remains "confident" his side can make a push to qualify for the Champions League next season, despite sitting nine points behind fourth-placed Manchester United.
When asked if he was confident the team could still qualify for next season's Champions League, Potter said: "I'm confident with the potential we have.
"What we need to do now is gel the team," Potter added.
"I think you have to look at it all in terms of transfer fees and salaries" Potter said.
"But we're confident in what we're doing and I think we've done a good job and now my job is to improve the team."

     Fernandez debut fizzles as Chelsea held by Fulham to 0-0
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON (AP) — Enzo Fernandez’s debut for Chelsea fizzled out as Fulham earned a worthy 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge in the English Premier League on Friday.
Chelsea was left stranded in ninth and its indifferent form was extended to one win in six in the league.
Fulham proved it was not necessary to spend 315 million pounds ($380 million) in the January transfer window to sit in the upper reaches of the top-flight.
Marco Silva’s well-drilled team made the host look toothless at times at the end of a week in which it spent 106.5 million pounds to land World Cup winner Fernandez.
The second half continued in a vein in which Fulham more than held its own against the host’s expensive assemble.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "That bit of connection, that bit of fluidity, that bit of understanding that you need, we lacked a little bit."
Chelsea are currently nine points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester United who have a game in hand.
Fulham boss Marco Silva praised his team, who beat Chelsea 2-1 at Craven Cottage in January.
Rather than worry about Chelsea's new-look squad, he said Fulham made sure they maintained the form that has propelled them to sixth in the table.
"Our focus to be honest is on ourselves ... and what we can do as a team," the Portuguese coach said.

     Summary: Chelsea and Fulham drew 0-0 in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge as new British-record signing Enzo Fernandez made his debut for the home side.
Mykhailo Mudryk also made his full debut for Graham Potter's side, while Reece James returned from injury to make his first appearance since December 27.
Mudryk was removed as the second half began, replaced by another new signing making his club debut, Noni Madueke.
The second half saw more opportunities for each side, but no breakthrough.
Both sides moved up one place in the table for the time being - Fulham to sixth and Chelsea to ninth.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The fact the game went goalless -- their third in their past six Premier League games -- summed up their season so far.
Chelsea fans did get a first glimpse at Enzo Fernandez, the new Premier League record signee who arrived in the final minutes of Tuesday's transfer deadline day.
They also have netted the fewest goals (22) in the Premier League top 10, and it's not close.
Fulham fans are wrong -- for a start, there are three Premier League sides in west London -- but Fulham remain on top of the pack.

     Aubameyang cut from Chelsea’s Champions League squad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s future has been placed into further doubt after the striker suffered the humiliation of being omitted from Chelsea’s 25-man Champions League squad.
Aubameyang was also left out of the squad for Chelsea’s disappointing goalless draw with Fulham on Friday night.
Potter said that Aubameyang had permission to fly to Italy and said he will have a chance of being involved at West Ham next weekend.
Striving to remain diplomatic, Potter said leaving Aubameyang out will not cause problems for the rest of the season.
Aubameyang has scored only three goals this season and cut a frustrated figure when he became a substituted substitute during Chelsea’s defeat by Manchester City last month.
