     Fernandez debut fizzles as Chelsea held by Fulham to 0-0
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareLONDON — Enzo Fernandez’s debut for Chelsea fizzled out as Fulham earned a worthy 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge in the English Premier League on Friday.
Chelsea was left stranded in ninth and its indifferent form was extended to one win in six in the league.
Fulham proved it was not necessary to spend 315 million pounds ($380 million) in the January transfer window to sit in the upper reaches of the top-flight.
Marco Silva’s well-drilled team made the host look toothless at times at the end of a week in which it spent 106.5 million pounds to land World Cup winner Fernandez.
AdvertisementThe second half continued in a vein in which Fulham more than held its own against the host’s expensive assemble.

     Mudryk, Fernandez and Joao Felix included in Chelsea Champions League squad with Aubameyang and other signings left out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mykhailo Mudryk, Enzo Fernandez and Joao Felix have all been added to Chelsea’s Champions League for the latter stages of the competition, while Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been left out to make space.
David Datro Fofana, Noni Madueke, Andrey Santos, Gabriel Slonina and Benoit Badiashile have also been left out of Graham Potter’s 25-man European squad.
Chelsea had registered a 24-man squad for the group stages of the Champions League.
Since the 2018-19 season, there has not been a ‘cup-tied’ rule in the Champions League — meaning Mudryk (Shakhtar), Fernandez (Benfica) and Felix (Atletico) were all eligible to be registered despite featuring in the group stages for other teams.

     Benfica president slams Fernandez's actions in Chelsea deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: New Chelsea signing Enzo Fernandez gives his first interview since joining the club in a record-breaking deal from Benfica.
(1:15)Benfica president Rui Costa has hit out at Enzo Fernandez for his behaviour before leaving the club to join Chelsea for a British record fee.
Chelsea signed the Argentina international on transfer deadline day from Benfica after meeting the midfielder's €121 million release clause.
Enzo Fernandez signed for Chelsea on a British record £106 million on deadline day.
Rui Costa, nevertheless, said he respects Fernandez's decision.

     Record signing Fernandez starts for Chelsea against Fulham
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - British record signing Enzo Fernandez will make his debut for Chelsea on Friday after his 106.8 million pounds ($128.79 million) transfer from Benfica this week.
The 22-year-old Argentina World Cup winner, who signed late on the last day of the transfer window on Tuesday, lines up in midfield for Chelsea's Premier League clash against neighbours Fulham at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea coach Graham Potter also gives new Ukrainian signing Mykhailo Mudryk his first start after the winger looked impressive as a substitute against Liverpool a fortnight ago.
Wingback Reece James returns to the side following an injury that has kept him on the sidelines since Dec. 27.
Tenth-placed Chelsea, who spent about 300 million pounds in January's transfer window, lost 2-1 to Fulham at Craven Cottage last month.

     Aubameyang cut from Chelsea squad for Champions League
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And on Friday Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang became a high-profile casualty of that midseason shopping spree when he was cut from Chelsea’s squad for the Champions League knockout stages.
Aubameyang, who was signed from Barcelona last summer and started all six of the group stage games, faces an uncertain future after his omission.
It followed $305 million worth of signings in the summer after the consortium bought the club for $2.5 billion last May.
“I don’t understand this part of the business; what you can do, what you cannot do.
I don’t forget, eight or nine teams in the Premier League sent a letter to the Premier League (for us) to be banned.
