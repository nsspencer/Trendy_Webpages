     Summary: ✖Courtney Stodden is looking back on getting married to 51-year-old Doug Hutchison at just 16 as they write a currently untitled memoir.

"I'm working with a therapist right now to kind of process it all too as I'm writing it out and reliving it again.
Despite the trauma that they've experienced, Stodden said it's helped them become "strong" and given them a new outlook on life.
