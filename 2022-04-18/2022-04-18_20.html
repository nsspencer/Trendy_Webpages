     Dua Lipa going braless in IG photo dump is really not that big of a deal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dua Lipa recently took to her Instagram and posted moody, chaotic pictures of herself, and one of the images from her photo dump saw her go braless.
In the midst of her whirlwind performances, Dua took to Instagram and gave fans a picturesque insight into her tour life.
She captioned it all: ‚ÄúRound hereeeee.‚ÄùIn one of the snaps, the star is seen donning a golden yellow co-ord outfit in which she‚Äôs seen braless.
It‚Äôs not a big dealIt‚Äôs not that big a deal for a celebrity to post a sans bra picture as many tend to go braless quite often.
Remember the time Elizabeth Hurley went braless in her black netted gown back in the 2001 pre-Oscar fashion bash?

     Dua Lipa, AO Arena, Manchester, review: A long-awaited victory for the disco-pop diva
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: advertisementsWhen Dua Lipa released one of their top pop albums as of late in March 2020, she had no idea it would become the soundtrack to the early stages of the pandemic.
This weekend, Lipa finally opened the UK leg of her tour of the AO Arena in Manchester, to a crowded house.
But for a big pop star like Lipa, singing is only half the story: the play is just as important.
Floating above the audience on a flying dance floor, Lipa jumped to the back of the stage to finally flourish.
The Future Nostalgia Tour was an incredible feat of ingenuity, packed with blow after blow and never lethargic, even in its quietest moments.

     Dua Lipa Went Braless and Wore the Most Controversial Pants Trend in Her Latest Photo Dump
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Sunday, Dua posted a series of outfit photos and concert clips captioned, "Round hereeeee ü´Ä."
In one snap in the dump, the singer made a case for monochrome while going braless in a completely golden-yellow outfit.
The first photo in the series showed Dua lounging backstage in bright blue and red printed pants, a navy leather moto jacket, and a white graphic T-shirt that said "smile for the camera."
Other inclusions in the dump showed the singer dancing around the stage in a tan mini skirt and bra top and multiple skin-tight catsuits.
The new post came days after Dua kicked off the British leg of her tour on April 15.

     Dua Lipa, AO Arena, Manchester, review: A long-awaited triumph for pop‚Äôs disco diva
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Future Nostalgia is a disco-tinged, eighties inspired party, made for dancing.
This weekend, Lipa finally opened the UK leg of her tour in Manchester‚Äôs AO Arena, to a packed house.
Lipa‚Äôs vocals were indistinguishable from the record, and jumps from the belting bridge of ‚ÄúPhysical‚Äù to the sultry low chorus of ‚ÄúPretty Please‚Äù displayed her range.
But, for a pop star as huge as Lipa, vocals are only half the story ‚Äì theatrics are just as important.
The Future Nostalgia tour was an impressive feat of showmanship, filled with banger after banger and never slipping into lethargy, even in its quieter moments.
