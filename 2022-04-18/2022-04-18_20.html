     Summary: “Three people seem to have been hit by ricochets and are now being cared for in hospital.
All three injured are arrested on suspicion of crime,” police said in an online statement, adding none of the injuries were life-threatening.
Protesters burn a barricade at the entrance to a shopping center during rioting in Norrkoping, Sweden on Sunday.
The violence began on Thursday after a demonstration organized by Rasmus Paludan, leader of Danish far-right political party Hard Line.
Paludan, who had permission for a series of demonstrations across Sweden during the Easter weekend, is known for Quran burnings.

     Sweden links riots triggered by Quran burnings to gangs that target police
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sweden, a nation of 10 million, has seen unrest, scuffles, arson and violence since Thursday that has left some police officers and protesters injured.
It was triggered by Danish far-right politician Rasmus Paludan’s meetings and planned Quran burnings across the country.
“We suspect that those involved (in the riots) have links to criminal gangs,” National Police Commissioner Anders Thornberg said at a news conference Monday, adding some of those “criminal individuals” are known to police.
Since Thursday, in addition to Malmo, riots, unrest and clashes have been reported in Stockholm, the central city of Orebro, the eastern cities of Linkoping and Norrkoping, and the southern town of Landskrona.
Thornberg, Sweden’s supreme police chief, said “criminal individuals” who took advantage of the situation with Paludan’s Swedish Easter tour and joined the riots are main suspects for dialing up the unrest.
