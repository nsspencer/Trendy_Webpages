     Draymond Green Reacts to Marcus Smart Winning DPOY
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "That's a guy I respect as a defender," Draymond said of Marcus Smart.
Draymond missed a good potion of Golden State's season with injury, after beginning to separate himself from the pack in the early season DPOY running.
His defensive impact is undeniable, and was once again on full display in Golden State's win on Monday night.
While he surely would have liked to take home the award, he used his time during his postgame press conference to congratulate Marcus Smart on winning DPOY.

     Why Celtics' Marcus Smart was the right choice for DPOY
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forsberg: Why Marcus Smart was the right choice for DPOY originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonAward ballots were long since submitted and tallied but there was one sequence in the Boston Celtics’ series-opening win over the Brooklyn Nets Sunday that really hammered home why Marcus Smart deserved the Defensive Player of the Year honor he received 24 hours later.
The Celtics were clinging to a two-point lead when Kevin Durant exploded past Jayson Tatum.
Smart, who was assigned to Goran Dragic in the far corner, spotted Durant’s drive and raced towards the charge circle.
Timing his leap perfectly, Smart went straight up to contest and flustered Durant, who must have thought he had an easy layup.
So much of Smart’s impact can’t be quantified by stats.
