     Three people injured in riots in Sweden after unrest sparked by anti-Islam far-right
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three people in the Swedish city of Norrkoping needed medical attention after being hit by police bullets during clashes between police and protesters following Quran burnings that caused riots in several Swedish towns over the Easter weekend.
All three injured are arrested on suspicion of crime,” police said in an online statement, adding none of the injuries were life-threatening.
Police and protesters have been engaged in serious clashes during the past days where several police have been injured and multiple vehicles have been torched.
The violence began on Thursday after a demonstration organized by Rasmus Paludan, leader of Danish far-right political party Hard Line.
Paludan, who had permission for a series of demonstrations across Sweden during the Easter weekend, is known for Quran burnings.

     Summary: Riots erupt in Sweden over rallies by an anti-Islam groupEnlarge this image toggle caption Johan Nilsson/AP Johan Nilsson/APHELSINKI (AP) — Swedish police said they fired warning shots during a riot in an eastern city to disperse protesters angry about demonstrations over the past several days by a Danish anti-Islam group in Sweden.
Paludan and his Stram Kurs party had planned a demonstration in Norrkoping on Sunday but he never showed up in the city, Swedish media reported.
In Landskrona, southern Sweden, a few hundred mostly young people threw stones and set cars, tires and dustbins on fire.
Paludan, a Danish lawyer who also holds Swedish citizenship, set up Stram Kurs, or "Hard Line" in 2017.
The website of the party, which runs on an anti-immigration and anti-Islam agenda, says "Stram Kurs is the most patriotic political party in Denmark."

     Sweden links riots triggered by Quran burnings to gangs that target police
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sweden, a nation of 10 million, has seen unrest, scuffles, arson and violence since Thursday that has left some police officers and protesters injured.
It was triggered by Danish far-right politician Rasmus Paludan’s meetings and planned Quran burnings across the country.
“We suspect that those involved (in the riots) have links to criminal gangs,” National Police Commissioner Anders Thornberg said at a news conference Monday, adding some of those “criminal individuals” are known to police.
Since Thursday, in addition to Malmo, riots, unrest and clashes have been reported in Stockholm, the central city of Orebro, the eastern cities of Linkoping and Norrkoping, and the southern town of Landskrona.
Thornberg, Sweden’s supreme police chief, said “criminal individuals” who took advantage of the situation with Paludan’s Swedish Easter tour and joined the riots are main suspects for dialing up the unrest.
