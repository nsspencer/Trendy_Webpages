    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marvel fans are normally a patient bunch — after all, all you have to is wait a few weeks and you’ll get some sort of Disney+ show now — but the absence of a trailer for Taika Waititi’s Thor: Love and Thunder really started to irritate some folks.
Well, the months of famine are over: feast upon this brand-new teaser trailer, which Marvel dropped on the morning of this glorious Patriots Day.
Thor: Love and Thunder arrives in theaters on July 8.
That’s really not that far away!
Or maybe you can just look like Thor did in Endgame.

     New ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ trailer reveals a new goddess of thunder – TechCrunch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Slated to hit theaters on July 8, 2022, “Thor: Love and Thunder” will see the God of Thunder taking some time off and Natalie Portman starring as Doctor Jane Foster, the new Mighty Thor with Mjolnir in hand.
Marvel Studios' Thor: Love and Thunder arrives only in theaters July 8.
Jane Foster was first introduced in the 2011 “Thor” as an astrophysicist and returned in 2013’s “Thor: The Dark World,” becoming Thor’s love interest.
Previously scheduled to release on May 6, the Marvel film was delayed to later in the summer.
“Thor: Love and Thunder” will most likely begin streaming on Disney+ in September.

     Summary: Chris Hemsworth's Thor appears to find peace in the "Thor: Love and Thunder" teaser.
Intergalactic evil will probably pull Thor out of retirement, though the teaser doesn’t share just who or what that evil might be.
There are a few cast members we don’t see – though, could that be the back of franchise newcomer Christian Bale?
– but the trailer does end, crucially, with a shot of Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster as a woman Thor.
The ever-secretive Marvel Studios probably won’t reveal much more until the film’s premiere on July 8.

     Thor: Love and Thunder’s cracked Mjolnir may be hiding something cooler
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Thor: Love and Thunder tells the story of how the original Thor is pulled out of his adventurous but relatively chill retirement by the arrival of Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), a killer on an intergalactic crusade to rid the universe of god-like aliens.
Toward the end of War of the Realms, Jane and Odinson were forced to confront the berserker War Thor — an Asgardian driven mad by another universe’s Mjolnir.
Of course, the trajectories of Marvel’s comics and Marvel Studios’ films are radically different from one another, and it seems unlikely that Thor: Love and Thunder’s bringing MCU Jane Foster back just to show everyone how she decides to stop being Thor.
But the question now is whether her return to the MCU is just a one-off thing or if Thor: Love and Thunder is just the beginning of her reign as Asgard’s newest defender.
Thor: Love and Thunder hits theaters on July 8th, 2022.

     ‘Thor: Love And Thunder’ Trailer Sparks Mass Mockery Of Chris Pratt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chris Pratt attends the "Guardians of the Galaxy" photocall on July 25, 2014 in London, England.
... [+] (Photo by Stuart C. Wilson/Getty Images) Getty ImagesThe first Thor Love and Thunder trailer has arrived, teasing the dynamic between Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, and giving fans their first official look at Natalie Portman’s Lady Thor.
Taika Waititi’s distinctive sense of humor shines through the trailer, and one particular scene caught the attention of fans, prompting mass mockery of MCU actor Chris Pratt.
On Twitter, this lead to mass mockery of Pratt, as fans imagined his discomfort filming the scene.
Thor himself, actor Chris Hemsworth, remains beloved by Marvel fans, probably because he keeps his beliefs, religious or otherwise, to himself.

     ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ Teaser Reveals Natalie Portman as the New Thor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Set to Guns ‘N Roses’ “Sweet Child ‘O Mine,” the trailer begins with Thor on a quest of self-discovery.
Capping off the teaser, Portman calls down Thor’s hammer Mjolnir, which is now magically pieced back together, and debuts her comic-accurate Mighty Thor costume.
However, Waititi reportedly directly convinced Portman to return to the MCU for the project.
In addition to old faces, “Love and Thunder” will also introduce new cast members to the franchise.
“Thor: Love and Thunder” premieres in theater July 8.
