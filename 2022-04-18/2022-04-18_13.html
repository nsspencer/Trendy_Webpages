     Kendrick Lamar reveals highly anticipated new album will drop in May
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Rapper Kendrick Lamar has announced his return, revealing the date of his long-awaited fifth album.
Lamar kept the announcement vague -- initially sharing the news on Twitter in response to a tweet reading "Kendrick Lamar is officially retired."
In August, Lamar announced his plans to leave TDE, under which all of his previous albums have been released.
This will be his last album under the label, he said at the time.
"As I produce my final TDE album, I feel joy to have been a part of such a cultural imprint after 17 years.
