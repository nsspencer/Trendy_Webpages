     Colin Kaepernick Willing To Be A Backup: NFL World Reacts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For over five years Colin Kaepernick has told anyone who would listen that he can be a starting quarterback in the NFL.
But with no contact offers hitting his agent’s inbox, it appears he’s ready to change tactics.
Speaking to TMZ, Kaepernick said that he’s content with coming in as a backup if it gets him through the door.
So, if I have to come in as a backup, that’s fine,” Kaepernick said.
Will Colin Kaepernick return as a backup in 2022?

     49ers News: Colin Kaepernick gives rare on-camera interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Kaepernick doesn’t speak to the media very often, and he speaks on camera even less.
Despite that, however, Kaepernick was a guest on the I Am Athlete podcast, and the episode will drop later today on YouTube.
Many athletes have appeared on the I Am Athlete podcast in the past and gotten into some fascinating conversations that they might not have otherwise discussed in a traditional sit-down interview with a host.
Cam Newton said he went to New England because he was desperate, and DJ Williams admitted Josh McDaniels spied on other teams as head coach of the Broncos.
I’ll be fascinated to see if he talks about his experiences since he was blackballed.
