     Ezra Miller, ‘The Flash’ Actor, Arrested on Assault Charge in Hawaii
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Ezra Miller, who has played the superhero The Flash in several movies and television series, is facing an assault charge in Hawaii after being accused of hurling a chair.
Miller was at a gathering at a private residence on the Big Island of Hawaii, according to the police.
The 29-year-old actor “became irate after being asked to leave,” the police said, and was then said to have thrown a chair that struck a 26-year-old woman on the forehead, causing a half-inch cut.
The woman refused treatment, the police said.
Miller was arrested at 1:30 a.m. Tuesday after a traffic stop, the police said, and later released “pending further investigation.”That arrest was the second on Hawaii in less than a month for Miller, who is known for roles in superhero movies and Harry Potter spinoffs and for wearing surrealist, gender-bending outfits on the red carpet.
