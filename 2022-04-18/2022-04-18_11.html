     Federal Judge Strikes Down Mask Mandate for Planes and Public Transit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: would not enforce the mandate, a series of state and local transit agencies across the country suggested they would keep their mask mandates for now.
On Monday, the city of Philadelphia reinstated a mask mandate in response, becoming the first major city to do so.
“We urge everyone to practice patience, remain calm, and to continue to follow crew member instructions,” she said.
“And we remind passengers that it is legally required to follow crew member instructions, and that disruptive behavior has serious consequences as it puts everyone at risk.”President Biden had called on the C.D.C.
to issue a mask mandate for travelers shortly after his inauguration, and the agency did so on Feb. 2, 2021.

     TSA will not enforce Covid mask mandate on planes, public transit after court ruling, White House says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal judge in Florida on Monday vacated the Biden administration's national Covid mask mandate for planes and other forms of public transportation, ruling that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had overstepped its authority.
The Transportation Security Administration will not enforce the mask mandate on public transportation after the court's ruling, a Biden administration official said.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki, in a press conference Monday, said the administration is reviewing the court's ruling and the Justice Department will determine whether it will appeal.
The CDC mandate also applied to trains, buses, taxis and ride-shares among other forms of public transit.
The court's ruling comes less than a week after the CDC extended the mask mandate for 15 days, amid a rise in Covid infections nationwide due to the more contagious omicron BA.2 subvariant.

     Judge Strikes Down Biden Mask Mandate for Planes, Transit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 18, 2022 – A federal judge in Florida has struck down the Biden administration’s mandate that travelers on airlines, buses, trains, and other public transit wear masks.
The mandate, enacted in February 2021, is unconstitutional because Congress never granted the CDC the power to create such a requirement, U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle said in her order issued Monday.
“Congress addressed whether the CDC may enact preventative measures that condition the interstate travel of an entire population to CDC dictates.
The Biden administration has extended the mask mandate several times since it was first announced.
Lawsuits have been filed over the mandate, but Mizelle ruled in favor of two people and the Health Freedom Defense Fund, who filed suit in July 2021.

     Summary: TSA will no longer enforce travel mask mandate after a federal judge strikes it downEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThe federal travel mask mandate will not be implemented as the Biden administration reviews a Florida federal judge's ruling against it.
"Therefore, TSA will not enforce its Security Directives and Emergency Amendment requiring mask use on public transportation and transportation hubs at this time."
U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle ruled that the federal mask mandate on planes, trains, buses and other modes of public transportation is "unlawful."
"The court concludes that the mask mandate exceeds the CDC's statutory authority and violates the procedures required for agency rulemaking under the APA," the judge wrote.
The White House called a federal judge's decision against the CDC mandate for public transportation "disappointing," but said the administration's response was still under review.

     Florida judge overturns CDC mask mandate for planes and trains, calling it 'unlawful'
    </h2>

     Summary: A federal judge on Monday struck down the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's rule that all travelers must wear masks on airplanes, buses, trains and other modes of public transportation, calling it "unlawful."
The CDC has renewed the travel mask mandate several times, most recently extending it through May 3.
United Airlines and Alaska Airlines both issued statements saying mask wearing is now optional.
The suit alleged that the CDC mandate was "arbitrary and capricious," since it gave exemptions to certain groups — like children under 2 years old — but not others.
They said the mask mandate was a conventional sanitation measure within the CDC’s authority.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadA federal judge in Florida on Monday voided a national mask mandate for airplanes and in other transportation settings.
Federal officials last week had extended the mask mandate for commercial flights and in other transportation settings, including on buses, ferries and subways, until at least May 3.
A Biden administration official said Monday evening that the court decision means the CDC’s masking order is “not in effect at this time.
The transportation mandate has been among the highest-profile mask requirements in the country, persisting after most school districts and other jurisdictions have allowed similar mandates to expire.
She said the Department of Homeland Security — which includes the Transportation Security Administration — was reviewing the decision.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — A federal judge in Florida has voided the national mask mandate covering airplanes and other public transportation as exceeding the authority of U.S. health officials in the coronavirus pandemic.

     Summary: "The agencies are reviewing the decision and assessing potential next steps," the Biden administration official said Monday night.
Just last week, the CDC extended this mask mandate through May 3.
US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said last week that part of the reason for the extension of the transportation mask mandate was because of rising Covid-19 cases and settings created by travel.
The Biden administration erred in failing to seek public notice and comment on the policy, she wrote.
