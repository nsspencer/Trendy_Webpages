     ‘Better Call Saul’ Recap, Season 6 Premiere: Run Nacho, Run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After spending two seasons a step or two behind his enemy, he finally knows something that Gus does not.
His plan, initially, is to link up with a couple of smugglers and sneak over the U.S. border to exact some revenge.
Thankfully, the camera cuts to an outside shot, looking in on the scheming couple, when Kim outlines her plan, so we don’t know any details.
Everything about this subplot, which threatens to become a major part of the Season 6 narrative, seems about 40 I.Q.
If the writers want Kim to explore her wicked side, there is surely a worthier target for her machinations, no?

     Better Call Saul Season 6: Who Are the Kettlemans?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The married couple was introduced in Better Call Saul’s series premiere “Uno” and were last seen in season 1’s episode “Bingo”.
They are the first clients that Better Call Saul viewers ever get to see Jimmy McGill represent…sort of.
The very transparently guilty Kettlemans don’t want an inexperienced, slimy lawyer like Jimmy representing them, but Jimmy has a hard time taking no for an answer.
Here is the full story of Jimmy and the Kettlemans first go-around in season 1.
Clearly the Kettlemans, Betsy in particular, have not forgotten their history with the lawyer formerly known as Jimmy McGill.

     Recap: Better Call Saul Season 6 Is Here—Along With the Countdown to Kim’s Doom?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you’re reading this, it’s because you are embarking on the sixth season of Better Call Saul and the eleventh season of gritty, prestigey television situated in Vince Gilligan’s Breaking Bad universe.
Among them: (1) How is Gus Fring going to get away with trying and failing to kill Lalo Salamanca?
(3) Are Kim and Jimmy/Saul really going to carry out some kind of scheme to ruin Howard’s life?
Last season ended with Lalo Salamanca going full berserker and neutralizing a paramilitary assassination squad before realizing that Nacho must have betrayed him.
Instead of rescuing Nacho, Gus sends Mike to execute one of those preposterously overcomplicated ruses that are a hallmark of this cinematic universe.

     Better Call Saul Season 6 Premiere Recap: The Con Is On — Plus, Boss Breaks Down That Surprise Return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Saul Goodman is back in business as Better Call Saul returns for its final season — and he’s reuniting with some old friends, too.
(Gus still isn’t sure Lalo is dead, but he tells Juan Bolsa he has an idea to keep the peace.)
Plus, Jimmy and Kim eye the next step in their plan: getting Clifford Main to take a meeting about a tempting class-action lawsuit.
The scheme leads Jimmy to reconnect with — the Kettlemans, the couple Jimmy represented back in Season 1!
Gould laughs: “Well, we’d be pretty crazy to put him on the key art and not ever see him.”Give the final Better Call Saul season premiere (!)

     How ‘Better Call Saul’ turned Kim’s ‘scammy side’ into an indelible turning point
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following an unsuccessful attempt from Jimmy to use a “carrot” approach (bribing the pesky Kettlemans) Kim intentionally opts for a much more heavy-handed “stick” method.
She doesn’t like that [Jimmy’s] being soft with [the Kettlemans],” Seehorn told The Times.
‘A means to an end’Much of the discourse surrounding the early seasons of “Better Call Saul” revolved around the big three of Saul Goodman, Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) and eventually Gus Fring.
The lines continue to blur regarding Kim’s morality, and her actions in “Carrot and Stick” are an unnerving turning point for the character.
“She’s right up there with Jimmy McGill and Walter White as one of those indelible, complex characters who are unpredictable but fascinating.”

     ‘Better Call Saul’ Season 6: The Beginning of the End
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Better Call Saul is finally back for the first half of its sixth and final season.
As is often the case this early in a Saul season, the plot moves very slowly.
(*) Two Cousin echoes here: First, Leonel and Marco themselves went to America in a coyote truck back in Breaking Bad Season Three, and also left bodies in their wake.
Early in “Carrot and Stick,” Jimmy is proposing a way to have a fake client approach Cliff Main.
Similarly, Better Call Saul has to find a way at the start of every season to have things move relatively slowly, but never so that it’s boring.
