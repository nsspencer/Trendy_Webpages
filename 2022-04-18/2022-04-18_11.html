     49ers News: Colin Kaepernick gives rare on-camera interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Kaepernick doesn’t speak to the media very often, and he speaks on camera even less.
Despite that, however, Kaepernick was a guest on the I Am Athlete podcast, and the episode will drop later today on YouTube.
Many athletes have appeared on the I Am Athlete podcast in the past and gotten into some fascinating conversations that they might not have otherwise discussed in a traditional sit-down interview with a host.
Cam Newton said he went to New England because he was desperate, and DJ Williams admitted Josh McDaniels spied on other teams as head coach of the Broncos.
I’ll be fascinated to see if he talks about his experiences since he was blackballed.

     Colin Kaepernick Says Seahawks ‘Don’t Have a Starter’ As He Eyes NFL Return
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Kaepernick has made his intention of a return to the NFL crystal clear in recent weeks.
“No team’s brought me in for a workout,” Kaepernick said on the show.
And out of that, Pete Carroll said, ‘Hey, he’s a starter, we have a starter.’ And things moved on from there.
Kaepernick, 34, is a career 59.8% passer and threw for 12,271 yards, 72 touchdowns and 30 interceptions over six seasons with the 49ers.
Kaepernick is 28–30 as an NFL starting quarterback in the regular season.

     Colin Kaepernick 'absolutely' committed to NFL comeback, suggests Seahawks as potential destination
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier this month, former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick worked out for NFL scouts in an effort to jump-start a 2022 comeback.
"Five years of training behind the scenes," Kaepernick said, explaining that he "without question" desires to return to the NFL.
"You don't do that if you don't have a passion and you don't believe you're gonna find a way on that field."
And when I prove that I'm a starter, I wanna be able to step on the field as such.
1 ... (More importantly), the NFL is supposed to be a meritocracy."

     'Let me come in and show you': Colin Kaepernick reaffirms desire to play in NFL, wants to win Super Bowl

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: He says he "absolutely" wants to play in the NFL — "that's without question" — and will even take a backup job if that's what it takes to get signed.
I'll do all my work behind the scenes, I'll be prepared, and we're going to continue to reach out to every team for a workout,' " Kaepernick said.
Kaepernick helped take the 49ers to Super Bowl XLVII after the 2012 season, when San Francisco lost, 34-31, in a thrilling finish to the Baltimore Ravens.
In his six seasons in the NFL, Kaepernick has completed 59.8% of his passes for 12,271 yards, with 72 touchdowns versus 30 interceptions.
If you're talking about the playing side, come in, let me compete.

     Summary: Colin Kaepernick is serious about wanting to return to the NFL, and he's willing to be a backup quarterback if that's what it takes to get back into the league.
Kaepernick hasn't played in the NFL since 2016, the same season he began kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice.
So if you're talking about the business side, it shows [it's] beneficial.
If you're talking about the playing side, come in, let me compete.
So, when you're talking about the people that are in the building, that has never come out that I've been a distraction.
