    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a video that has gone viral on social media, Michigan lawmaker Mallory McMorrow has shut down Michigan Senator Lana Theis over "grooming" accusations.
Accordingto McMorrow, in a fundraising email, Theis called her a groomer and said that she was sexualizing children.
In screenshots shared to social media, Theis called out "progressive social media trolls like Senator Mallory McMorrow (D-Snowflake) who are outraged they can't groom and sexualize kindergarteners or that 8-year olds are responsible for slavery."
At the end of the email, Theis implored readers to "stand up with me by making a dontation today!"
There, Theis claimed children were "under attack" from "forces that desire things for them other than what their parents would have them see and hear and know.”
