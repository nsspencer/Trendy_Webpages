     Don’t Call Her ‘Baby.’ At 62, Jennifer Grey is Taking the Lead.

     Summary: Cuffed, cutoff jean shorts and white Keds became the official summer uniform of every adolescent whose Sun-In and perm didn’t quite achieve Grey’s honey-colored waves.
Following the advice of her mother and three plastic surgeons — one of whom recalled seeing “Dirty Dancing” and wondering “why that girl didn’t do her nose” — Grey underwent two surgeries to “fine-tune” her proboscis.
The second procedure, intended to correct an irregularity caused by the first, was more aggressive than what Grey expected.
She recalls an airline employee who glanced at her driver’s license and said, “‘Oh, Jennifer Grey, like the actress.’” When Grey said, “Actually, it is me,” the woman responded: “‘I’ve seen ‘Dirty Dancing a dozen times.
The woman’s face lit up, then softened as if she’d spotted an old friend who’d survived a terrible ordeal.

“Being misunderstood on a global stage was very painful,” Grey told The Times.
“We were so young,” Grey told The Times.

     Jennifer Grey’s mom urged her to get nose job that left her unrecognizable

     Summary: Jennifer Grey did not have the time of her life after undergoing two nose jobs that left her unrecognizable.
But after her second nose job, the self-proclaimed “anti-rhinoplasty” actress found herself at a premiere with Michael Douglas — who didn’t even recognize her.
I really thought it meant surrendering to the enemy camp.
I would wonder, you know, why was her … Um, her dad got a nose job.
Grey isn’t the first star to open up about her rhinoplasty; Khloé Kardashian recently revealed her “only regret” about getting a nose job was that she didn’t go under the knife sooner.
