     Celtics’ Marcus Smart named NBA Defensive Player of the Year, 1st time guard has won since Gary Payton
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Smart won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award Monday, the league announced.
It’s the first time since the 1995-96 season that a guard has won the award, when Gary Payton was given those honors.
“First off, definitely want to thank you guys, man, my coaching staff and teammates,” Smart said in a video posted by the Celtics on Twitter.
Payton was in Boston to celebrate Smart’s award alongside his Celtics teammates.
The Celtics’ Robert Williams III (seventh place) and Al Horford (ninth) also received votes for the top defensive player in the league.

     Marcus Smart Becomes First Guard Since Gary Payton in 1996 to Win NBA Defensive Player of the Year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Monday, Marcus Smart became the first guard to win the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year award since Gary Payton did so in the 1995-96 season.
It's worth noting the NBA didn't start naming a Defensive Player of the Year until 1982-83.
What made the moment Smart won Defensive Player of the Year even sweeter was that Gary Payton, who endorsed Smart for this award last week, flew to Boston to present it to him.
“You a guy that I think reminds me of myself," Payton told the newly crowned Defensive Player of the Year.
As for what Smart becoming the first guard since the Glove to win Defensive Player of the Year represents, he believes the impact of perimeter defenders is becoming more recognizable.
