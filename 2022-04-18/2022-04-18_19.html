“First off, definitely want to thank you guys, man, my coaching staff and teammates,” Smart said in a video posted by the Celtics on Twitter.
Payton was in Boston to celebrate Smart’s award alongside his Celtics teammates.
The Celtics’ Robert Williams III (seventh place) and Al Horford (ninth) also received votes for the top defensive player in the league.

     Marcus Smart Becomes First Guard Since Gary Payton in 1996 to Win NBA Defensive Player of the Year
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Monday, Marcus Smart became the first guard to win the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year award since Gary Payton did so in the 1995-96 season.
It's worth noting the NBA didn't start naming a Defensive Player of the Year until 1982-83.
What made the moment Smart won Defensive Player of the Year even sweeter was that Gary Payton, who endorsed Smart for this award last week, flew to Boston to present it to him.
“You a guy that I think reminds me of myself," Payton told the newly crowned Defensive Player of the Year.
As for what Smart becoming the first guard since the Glove to win Defensive Player of the Year represents, he believes the impact of perimeter defenders is becoming more recognizable.

     Why Celtics' Marcus Smart was the right choice for DPOY
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Forsberg: Why Marcus Smart was the right choice for DPOY originally appeared on NBC Sports BostonAward ballots were long since submitted and tallied but there was one sequence in the Boston Celtics’ series-opening win over the Brooklyn Nets Sunday that really hammered home why Marcus Smart deserved the Defensive Player of the Year honor he received 24 hours later.
The Celtics were clinging to a two-point lead when Kevin Durant exploded past Jayson Tatum.
Smart, who was assigned to Goran Dragic in the far corner, spotted Durant’s drive and raced towards the charge circle.
Timing his leap perfectly, Smart went straight up to contest and flustered Durant, who must have thought he had an easy layup.
So much of Smart’s impact can’t be quantified by stats.
