     Karol G Salutes Latin Icons Selena Quintanilla, Shakira, Gloria Estefan, More During Electrifying Coachella Set
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Karol G’s “Bichotella” set at Coachella on Sunday night put the young Latin star’s magnetism on display in an electrifying, arena-level performance.
“Next stop — Coachella!” could be heard as the reggaeton and Latin trap singer made her entrance onto the barrio-themed stage, emblazoned with the words “Tusa” and “Bichotella.” Blue wigs flooded the rows of enraptured fans that watched Karol serve every line through a smile that stayed throughout the entirety of her hour-long set.
Nothing but blue wigs at the #BICHOTELLA 😎 Karol G is taking Coachella!
Karol brought out two special guests: Dutch DJ and producer, Tiesto, who joined her on the Coachella stage for a performance of their bilingual dance track, “Don’t Be Shy,” and later, Becky G appeared for a surprise performance of their female empowerment anthem, “Mamiii.” With Karol at the foot of a massive staircase and Becky at the top, the two met for a steamy dance and finished their song with Karol dipping out early for her next outfit change.
She also paid tribute to Shakira’s global hit “Hips Don’t Lie” with her dancers appearing in the white airy outfits Shakira’s dancers regularly wore during her performances of “Cumbia De Colombia!” Karol ended the medley with Luis Fonsi’s cultural shape-shifter, “Despacito” and J Balvin and Willy Williams’ “Mi Gente.”Leaving Latin America and Colombia at an all-time high, Karol’s genre-blurring Coachella set closed with the Nicki Minaj-featured track “Tusa” — which she finished atop the platform, letting out a triumphant laugh.
