     ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ Trailer: Chris Hemsworth Returns as the Nordic God in Taika Waititi’s Marvel Epic
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Christian Bale and Russell Crowe join Hemsworth in the latest "Thor" film, which also marks Natalie Portman's return to the MCU.
Chris Hemsworth returns as the titular Nordic god in “Thor: Love and Thunder,” directed by Taika Waititi and also starring Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie.
Natalie Portman additionally revealed that “Love and Thunder” might finally tackle her character Jane’s cancer arc from the comics, before she also received superhero powers to become Mighty Thor.
“Thor: Love and Thunder” will now be in theaters after “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” and it’s unclear in which timeline the events of “Love and Thunder” will occur.
“Thor: Love and Thunder” premieres in theaters on July 8 as part of Phase Four of the MCU rollout.

     First Thor: Love and Thunder trailer puts Mjolnir in Jane’s mighty hands
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jane Foster has always been more than the Odinson’s love interest, but you might not know that just from watching any of Marvel’s Thor movies so far — the last of which she simply wasn’t in.
Thor: Love &amp; Thunder wants to fix that and then some, judging from its first trailer.
Marvel Studios' Thor: Love and Thunder arrives only in theaters July 8.
Love and Thunder’s clearly pulling in elements of Jane’s time as Thor and the only person capable of wielding Mjolnir, which is an interesting bit of lore to bring her back into the films with.
Thor: Love and Thunder is slated to hit theaters on July 8th, 2022.

     Marvel’s ‘Thor: Love And Thunder’ Trailer Arrives A Little Early
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I don’t know why Disney didn’t wait until next week (Cinemacon) or the week after that (the release of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness), but we now have our first teaser trailer for Thor: Love and Thunder.
Yes, Thor: Love and Thunder opens July 8, meaning this trailer dropped just over ten weeks before opening day.
Anyone who argues that’s not enough time should recall the successful trailer launches of Jordan Peele’s Us (one trailer dropped on Christmas Day just under three months from release) or WB’s Godzilla Vs. Kong (one trailer dropped 2.5 months before release).
The Batman dropped a super early DC Fandome teaser in August of 2020 and then nothing until mid-October of 2021, 3.5 months before release.
Directed by Waititi (“Thor: Ragnarok,” “Jojo Rabbit”) and produced by Kevin Feige and Brad Winderbaum, “Thor: Love and Thunder” opens in theaters July 8, 2022.

     ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ Teaser Reveals Natalie Portman as the New Thor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Set to Guns ‘N Roses’ “Sweet Child ‘O Mine,” the trailer begins with Thor on a quest of self-discovery.
Capping off the teaser, Portman calls down Thor’s hammer Mjolnir, which is now magically pieced back together, and debuts her comic-accurate Mighty Thor costume.
However, Waititi reportedly directly convinced Portman to return to the MCU for the project.
In addition to old faces, “Love and Thunder” will also introduce new cast members to the franchise.
“Thor: Love and Thunder” premieres in theater July 8.
