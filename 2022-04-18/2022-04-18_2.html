     Summary: Riots erupt in Sweden over rallies by an anti-Islam groupEnlarge this image toggle caption Johan Nilsson/AP Johan Nilsson/APHELSINKI (AP) ‚Äî Swedish police said they fired warning shots during a riot in an eastern city to disperse protesters angry about demonstrations over the past several days by a Danish anti-Islam group in Sweden.
Paludan and his Stram Kurs party had planned a demonstration in Norrkoping on Sunday but he never showed up in the city, Swedish media reported.
In Landskrona, southern Sweden, a few hundred mostly young people threw stones and set cars, tires and dustbins on fire.
