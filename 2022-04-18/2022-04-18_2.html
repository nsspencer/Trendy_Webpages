     Marvel Studios Unveils First Glimpse of the Cosmic Adventure ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marvel Studios has shared a new trailer and poster for Thor: Love and Thunder, offering long-awaited clues to what’s in store for the God of Thunder.
The film finds Thor (Chris Hemsworth) on a journey unlike anything he’s ever faced—a quest for inner peace.
To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi) and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who—to Thor’s surprise—inexplicably wields his magical hammer, Mjolnir, as the Mighty Thor.
Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher’s vengeance and stop him before it’s too late.
Directed by Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok, Jojo Rabbit) and produced by Kevin Feige and Brad Winderbaum, Thor: Love and Thunder opens in theaters July 8, 2022.

     The first 'Thor: Love and Thunder' teaser is here with a first look at a female Thor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Marvel fans are finally worthy -- the studio just released the first teaser for its highly anticipated summer flick, "Thor: Love and Thunder."
Starring Chris Hemsworth as the titular god, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill of "Guardians of the Galaxy" and Tessa Thompson as the heroic Valkyrie, the particulars of the film's plot remain under wraps, as is Marvel's M.O.
But the first footage of the film promises familiar antics from the Avenger and his crew.
When we reunite with the well-groomed god in the trailer, he says he's apparently given up "superhero-ing," preferring to run around with his alien pal Korg (voiced by director Taika Waititi) and smooch blue-haired love interests on what appears to be an airborne pirate ship.
Intergalactic evil will probably pull Thor out of retirement, though the teaser doesn't share just who or what that evil might be.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Marvel fans are normally a patient bunch — after all, all you have to is wait a few weeks and you’ll get some sort of Disney+ show now — but the absence of a trailer for Taika Waititi’s Thor: Love and Thunder really started to irritate some folks.
Well, the months of famine are over: feast upon this brand-new teaser trailer, which Marvel dropped on the morning of this glorious Patriots Day.
Thor: Love and Thunder arrives in theaters on July 8.
That’s really not that far away!
Or maybe you can just look like Thor did in Endgame.

     First Thor: Love and Thunder trailer puts Mjolnir in Jane’s mighty hands
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jane Foster has always been more than the Odinson’s love interest, but you might not know that just from watching any of Marvel’s Thor movies so far — the last of which she simply wasn’t in.
Thor: Love &amp; Thunder wants to fix that and then some, judging from its first trailer.
Marvel Studios' Thor: Love and Thunder arrives only in theaters July 8.
Love and Thunder’s clearly pulling in elements of Jane’s time as Thor and the only person capable of wielding Mjolnir, which is an interesting bit of lore to bring her back into the films with.
Thor: Love and Thunder is slated to hit theaters on July 8th, 2022.

     Marvel’s ‘Thor: Love And Thunder’ Trailer Arrives A Little Early
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I don’t know why Disney didn’t wait until next week (Cinemacon) or the week after that (the release of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness), but we now have our first teaser trailer for Thor: Love and Thunder.
Yes, Thor: Love and Thunder opens July 8, meaning this trailer dropped just over ten weeks before opening day.
Anyone who argues that’s not enough time should recall the successful trailer launches of Jordan Peele’s Us (one trailer dropped on Christmas Day just under three months from release) or WB’s Godzilla Vs. Kong (one trailer dropped 2.5 months before release).
The Batman dropped a super early DC Fandome teaser in August of 2020 and then nothing until mid-October of 2021, 3.5 months before release.
Directed by Waititi (“Thor: Ragnarok,” “Jojo Rabbit”) and produced by Kevin Feige and Brad Winderbaum, “Thor: Love and Thunder” opens in theaters July 8, 2022.

     ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ Teaser Reveals Natalie Portman as the New Thor
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Set to Guns ‘N Roses’ “Sweet Child ‘O Mine,” the trailer begins with Thor on a quest of self-discovery.
Capping off the teaser, Portman calls down Thor’s hammer Mjolnir, which is now magically pieced back together, and debuts her comic-accurate Mighty Thor costume.
However, Waititi reportedly directly convinced Portman to return to the MCU for the project.
In addition to old faces, “Love and Thunder” will also introduce new cast members to the franchise.
“Thor: Love and Thunder” premieres in theater July 8.
