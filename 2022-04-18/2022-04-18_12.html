     TSA will not enforce Covid mask mandate on planes, public transit after court ruling, White House says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal judge in Florida on Monday vacated the Biden administration's national Covid mask mandate for planes and other forms of public transportation, ruling that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had overstepped its authority.
The Transportation Security Administration will not enforce the mask mandate on public transportation after the court's ruling, a Biden administration official said.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki, in a press conference Monday, said the administration is reviewing the court's ruling and the Justice Department will determine whether it will appeal.
The CDC mandate also applied to trains, buses, taxis and ride-shares among other forms of public transit.
The court's ruling comes less than a week after the CDC extended the mask mandate for 15 days, amid a rise in Covid infections nationwide due to the more contagious omicron BA.2 subvariant.

     Judge Strikes Down Biden Mask Mandate for Planes, Transit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 18, 2022 – A federal judge in Florida has struck down the Biden administration’s mandate that travelers on airlines, buses, trains, and other public transit wear masks.
The mandate, enacted in February 2021, is unconstitutional because Congress never granted the CDC the power to create such a requirement, U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle said in her order issued Monday.
“Congress addressed whether the CDC may enact preventative measures that condition the interstate travel of an entire population to CDC dictates.
The Biden administration has extended the mask mandate several times since it was first announced.
Lawsuits have been filed over the mandate, but Mizelle ruled in favor of two people and the Health Freedom Defense Fund, who filed suit in July 2021.

     Summary: TSA will no longer enforce travel mask mandate after a federal judge strikes it downEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThe federal travel mask mandate will not be implemented as the Biden administration reviews a Florida federal judge's ruling against it.
"Therefore, TSA will not enforce its Security Directives and Emergency Amendment requiring mask use on public transportation and transportation hubs at this time."
U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle ruled that the federal mask mandate on planes, trains, buses and other modes of public transportation is "unlawful."
"The court concludes that the mask mandate exceeds the CDC's statutory authority and violates the procedures required for agency rulemaking under the APA," the judge wrote.
The White House called a federal judge's decision against the CDC mandate for public transportation "disappointing," but said the administration's response was still under review.

     TSA stops mask enforcement after federal judge voids mandate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Federal officials last week had extended the mask mandate for commercial flights and in other settings, including on buses, ferries and subways, until at least May 3.
The transportation mandate has been among the highest-profile mask requirements in the country, persisting after most school districts and other jurisdictions have allowed similar mandates to expire.
The mask mandate did not wear heavily on their minds.
“I still don’t understand a Florida judge reversing a federal mandate when the mandate is backed by as much science as it is,” he said.
Last month, executives from 10 airlines, including American, United and Delta, sent a letter to Biden urging him to end pandemic-related travel policies, including the mask mandate.
