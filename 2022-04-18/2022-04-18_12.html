     ‘Better Call Saul’ Season 6 Opens in Explosive, Masterful Fashion
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Americans nearly went into cardiac arrest when, in July 2021, Bob Odenkirk suffered a heart attack on the set of Better Call Saul.
Since Kim doesn’t factor into Breaking Bad, her destiny has long been a potential tragedy hanging over these proceedings, and that doesn’t change as Better Call Saul picks up with her and Jimmy.
Jimmy hasn’t lost a step, but that’s not to say he’s the same old con man.
Not that there isn’t additional suspense in Better Call Saul, given that Nacho (Michael Mando) is on the run from the cartel for helping Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) set Lalo up for assassination.
”Better Call Saul has arguably the finest cast on television, as well as the sharpest writing and direction.
