     Summary: A Florida judge overturns the CDC's mask mandate for planes and other public transitEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesA federal judge in Florida has ruled that the federal mask mandate on planes, trains, buses and other modes of public transportation is "unlawful."
U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle wrote in a summary filed Monday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has exceeded its authority and failed to follow proper rulemaking procedures in requiring passengers and employees to wear face coverings while in transit.
Just last week, the agency extended the transportation mask mandate (which had been set to expire originally on April 18) through May 3 — allowing officials to take more time to study the BA.2 subvariant of COVID-19.
The mask-wearing requirement had been initially imposed in early 2021, shortly after President Joe Biden took office in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.

     A federal judge strikes down the mask mandate on planes and public transit.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Florida struck down the federal mask requirement on airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation on Monday, less than a week after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had extended it through May 3.
In a 59-page decision, Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, an appointee of former President Donald J. Trump, voided the mandate — which also applies to airports, train stations, and other transportation hubs — nationwide on several grounds, including ruling that the agency had exceeded its legal authority under the Public Health Services Act of 1944.
The Justice Department had no immediate comment on whether the Biden administration would appeal — and, if so, whether it would ask Judge Mizelle or an appeals court to stay her ruling pending any further litigation so that the rule could continue to be enforced.
It was not clear whether airlines would continue to require passengers to wear masks without the rule.
But last month, the executives of major airlines — including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines — had asked the Biden administration to let the mask mandate on planes and in airports to expire in a joint letter.

     Florida judge overturns CDC mask mandate for planes and public transit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal judge in Florida on Monday vacated the Biden administration's national Covid mask mandate for planes and other forms of public transportation, ruling that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had overstepped its authority.
The CDC mandate also applied to trains, buses, taxis and ride-shares among other forms of public transit.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki, in a press conference Monday, said the CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks on public transportation.
The agency said it needed time to assess whether the recent rise in Covid infections would have an impact on hospital capacity.
Airlines have repeatedly asked the Biden administration to the drop mask mandate as well as other restrictions such as predeparture testing for all international arrivals, including citizens.

     Judge Strikes Down Biden Mask Mandate for Planes, Transit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 18, 2022 – A federal judge in Florida has struck down the Biden administration’s mandate that travelers on airlines, buses, trains, and other public transit wear masks.
The mandate, enacted in February 2021, is unconstitutional because Congress never granted the CDC the power to create such a requirement, U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle said in her order issued Monday.
“Congress addressed whether the CDC may enact preventative measures that condition the interstate travel of an entire population to CDC dictates.
The Biden administration has extended the mask mandate several times since it was first announced.
Lawsuits have been filed over the mandate, but Mizelle ruled in favor of two people and the Health Freedom Defense Fund, who filed suit in July 2021.

     Florida court overturns CDC mask mandate for planes and trains, calling it 'unlawful'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The ruling, from U.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle in Tampa, Florida, said the CDC had overstepped its legal authority by imposing the mandate in February 2021.
The CDC has renewed the travel mask mandate several times, most recently extending it through May 3.
The suit alleged that the CDC mandate was "arbitrary and capricious," since it gave exemptions to certain groups — like children under 2 years old — but not others.
They said the mask mandate was a conventional sanitation measure within the CDC’s authority.
Judge Mizelle, who once clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, was appointed to the Middle District of Florida bench in 2020 by President Donald Trump.

Just last week, the CDC extended this mask mandate through May 3.
US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said last week that part of the reason for the extension of the transportation mask mandate was because of rising Covid-19 cases and settings created by travel.
"The Mask Mandate complies with neither of these subsections," the judge said.
