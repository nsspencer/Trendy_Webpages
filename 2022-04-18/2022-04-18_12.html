     ‘Better Call Saul’ Recap, Season 6 Premiere: Run Nacho, Run
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After spending two seasons a step or two behind his enemy, he finally knows something that Gus does not.
His plan, initially, is to link up with a couple of smugglers and sneak over the U.S. border to exact some revenge.
Thankfully, the camera cuts to an outside shot, looking in on the scheming couple, when Kim outlines her plan, so we don’t know any details.
Everything about this subplot, which threatens to become a major part of the Season 6 narrative, seems about 40 I.Q.
If the writers want Kim to explore her wicked side, there is surely a worthier target for her machinations, no?

     Recap: Better Call Saul Season 6—and the Countdown to Kim’s Doom?—Begin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you’re reading this, it’s because you are embarking on the sixth season of Better Call Saul and the eleventh season of gritty, prestigey television situated in Vince Gilligan’s Breaking Bad universe.
Among them: (1) How is Gus Fring going to get away with trying and failing to kill Lalo Salamanca?
(3) Are Kim and Jimmy/Saul really going to carry out some kind of scheme to ruin Howard’s life?
Last season ended with Lalo Salamanca going full berserker and neutralizing a paramilitary assassination squad before realizing that Nacho must have betrayed him.
Instead of rescuing Nacho, Gus sends Mike to execute one of those preposterously overcomplicated ruses that are a hallmark of this cinematic universe.

     ‘Better Call Saul’ Review: Brilliant ‘Wine and Roses’ Sets the Stage for a Whole Lot of Loss
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: [Note: The following review contains spoilers for “Better Call Saul” Season 6, Episode 1, “Wine and Roses.”]So this is how Season 6 begins, not with a Gene but a teardown.
It would be easy for a show like “Better Call Saul,” where its characters are often in mortal danger, to feel static after a while.
“Better Call Saul” has usually erred towards focusing on the threat of violence and the aftermath rather than the grisly stretch in the middle.
— and it gives “Better Call Saul” another chance to show that these actions do not exist in a vacuum.
Grade: A“Better Call Saul” airs Monday nights at 9 p.m. on AMC and is available on AMC+.

     How ‘Better Call Saul’ turned Kim’s ‘scammy side’ into an indelible turning point
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following an unsuccessful attempt from Jimmy to use a “carrot” approach (bribing the pesky Kettlemans) Kim intentionally opts for a much more heavy-handed “stick” method.
She doesn’t like that [Jimmy’s] being soft with [the Kettlemans],” Seehorn told The Times.
‘A means to an end’Much of the discourse surrounding the early seasons of “Better Call Saul” revolved around the big three of Saul Goodman, Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) and eventually Gus Fring.
The lines continue to blur regarding Kim’s morality, and her actions in “Carrot and Stick” are an unnerving turning point for the character.
“She’s right up there with Jimmy McGill and Walter White as one of those indelible, complex characters who are unpredictable but fascinating.”
