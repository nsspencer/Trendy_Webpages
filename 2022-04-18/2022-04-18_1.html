     Summary: WASHINGTON — As millions of Americans raced to finish filing their tax returns on Monday, the Biden administration made another plea for Congress to give the Internal Revenue Service more money.
The latest call for funding to modernize the agency and beef up its enforcement staff followed I.R.S.
and Treasury Department officials complaints that they are facing an extraordinarily challenging tax season because of staff shortages and the complexity associated with distributing pandemic relief money.
Ms. Sarin said the I.R.S.
had collected more than 130 million tax returns from individuals and businesses this year and had disbursed more than $220 billion in refunds.

At the end of the 2021 tax filing season in December, the IRS still had about 10.5 million returns to process.

“The first thing to do after you receive a letter from the IRS is to remain calm.
Amid preparers’ general cautions to wealthy clients, hard annual data on IRS audits is open to interpretation.
“For example, the IRS also uses reported information via W-2, 1099, K-1s and other informational returns to identify returns with missing data.
Take some responsibility in having your taxes done correctly.”Donnellan added, “Currently the IRS is very behind on return processing, so be patient.

     Summary: Tax refunds likely delayed because IRS is down tens of thousands of employeesNEW YORK -- Just because Monday is the deadline for filing your federal tax returns, it doesn't mean the Internal Revenue Service is ready to handle the workload.
"On average, our hold times can range anywhere between 30 and 40 minutes," said Ken Corbin, the IRS' chief taxpayer experience officer.
"They are starting the tax year with 3 million tax returns to finish from last year and then the tidal wave comes this year, of course, culminating today," said CBS News Congressional correspondent Scott McFarlane.
McFarlane says the IRS budget has been a victim of Congress.
They have the same number of processors to handle the paper and handle the phone and so they are juggling both the phone calls and the paper," McFarlane said.

     IRS Acknowledges Favorable Income Tax Strategy For IRA And 401k Accounts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 18, 2022On February 24, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations which, if finalized, will offer individuals a favorable income tax strategy most estate planning advisors doubted would ever exist.
With special drafting, it is also possible to have the income of the trust taxed at the spouse’s or children’s usually lower federal income tax rates, rather than at the typically much higher federal income tax rates imposed on trusts.
As a consequence, when the trust assets were later sold after the death of the spouse or child, there could be significant income taxes to pay.
In higher net worth situations, the income tax basis adjustment at the spouse’s or child’s death may be limited, but, if the trust instrument is properly structured, in most situations the income tax basis adjustment will be significant, if not full.
Also significant is the fact that, in so-called “dynasty trust” situations, i.e., where the estate tax, divorce and lawsuit protections of accumulation trusts are intended to continue for future generations, this same federal income tax basis adjustment at each generation can continue for hundreds of years, if not forever.

But few observers are noticing as the IRS keeps losing staffers not through mass layoffs, but through attrition.
But trying to extract that amount from hourly wage workers who are rightfully claiming a federal tax credit is the financial equivalent of getting blood from a stone.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Taxpayers across the United States were required to file their federal tax returns by April 18, and they did so amid a barrage of news about the Internal Revenue Service facing a significant backlog of tax returns, a staffing shortage and uncertainty about its funding.
The agency is facing an excess of 7 million returns from last year that still haven’t been processed.
Agency employees must manually enter information from paper returns, even though the technology exists that would allow the process to be automated.
“For historical reasons, we've left consumption taxes — the taxes you would pay at the cash register — to the states through retail sales taxes,” Gentry said.
“They don't tax business profits, so they don't affect investment.
