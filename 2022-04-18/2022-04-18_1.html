     Treasury makes a plea for more I.R.S. funding on Tax Day.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — As millions of Americans raced to finish filing their tax returns on Monday, the Biden administration made another plea for Congress to give the Internal Revenue Service more money.
The latest call for funding to modernize the agency and beef up its enforcement staff followed I.R.S.
and Treasury Department officials complaints that they are facing an extraordinarily challenging tax season because of staff shortages and the complexity associated with distributing pandemic relief money.
Ms. Sarin said the I.R.S.
had collected more than 130 million tax returns from individuals and businesses this year and had disbursed more than $220 billion in refunds.

     Chairman Connolly to Hold Hearing on IRS Operations Amid Expectedly Challenging Tax Season
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ET, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations, will hold a virtual hearing to examine the operations and financial condition of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), specifically how the agency will fare this tax season.
Every year, the IRS processes more than 150 million individual and business tax returns.
But as it heads into the 2022 tax season, the agency is still struggling to address a massive backlog of more than 23 million pieces of correspondence related to the 2020 tax season, including tax returns waiting to be processed, suspended returns, and returns that were amended.
The coronavirus pandemic further strained the IRS, which was tasked with issuing more than $1.5 trillion in economic relief to qualifying individuals, families, and businesses in addition to processing annual tax returns.
The hearing will examine ways Congress can ensure the IRS has the resources and staffing flexibilities it needs to effectively fulfill its duties with the 2022 tax season already underway.

     Summary: At end of the last filing season, Internal Revenue Service still had 10.5 million returns to process.
At the end of the 2021 tax filing season in December, the IRS still had about 10.5 million returns to process.
Erin Collins, National Taxpayer Advocate at the Internal Revenue Service, said the IRS has faced a variety of obstacles, including the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the agency's ability to do its job.
"This past year was the most challenging year that taxpayers and tax professionals have ever experienced," she said.
"The employees of the IRS, including myself, but specifically our employees are doing the best we can," said Charles Rettig, IRS Commissioner.

     Summary: Suffolk County officials want its septic improvement program to be exempt from federal taxes.
Suffolk County Executive Steven Bellone said the program pays up to $30,000 to contractors directly to replace old systems with nitrogen-filtering septic tanks, and offers rebates to homeowners that have already footed the bill themselves.
He called on the IRS to provide tax relief for participating residents.
If it’s not tax exempt, Bellone warned similar programs around the country would struggle to find participants.
Richberg also called on the IRS to provide tax breaks to residents participating in the program, and return money to those who have been tax burdened in the past.

     Summary: Tax refunds likely delayed because IRS is down tens of thousands of employeesNEW YORK -- Just because Monday is the deadline for filing your federal tax returns, it doesn't mean the Internal Revenue Service is ready to handle the workload.
"On average, our hold times can range anywhere between 30 and 40 minutes," said Ken Corbin, the IRS' chief taxpayer experience officer.
"They are starting the tax year with 3 million tax returns to finish from last year and then the tidal wave comes this year, of course, culminating today," said CBS News Congressional correspondent Scott McFarlane.
McFarlane says the IRS budget has been a victim of Congress.
They have the same number of processors to handle the paper and handle the phone and so they are juggling both the phone calls and the paper," McFarlane said.

“The first thing to do after you receive a letter from the IRS is to remain calm.
Amid preparers’ general cautions to wealthy clients, hard annual data on IRS audits is open to interpretation.
“For example, the IRS also uses reported information via W-2, 1099, K-1s and other informational returns to identify returns with missing data.
Take some responsibility in having your taxes done correctly.”Donnellan added, “Currently the IRS is very behind on return processing, so be patient.

     IRS Acknowledges Favorable Income Tax Strategy For IRA And 401k Accounts
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 18, 2022On February 24, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations which, if finalized, will offer individuals a favorable income tax strategy most estate planning advisors doubted would ever exist.
With special drafting, it is also possible to have the income of the trust taxed at the spouse’s or children’s usually lower federal income tax rates, rather than at the typically much higher federal income tax rates imposed on trusts.
As a consequence, when the trust assets were later sold after the death of the spouse or child, there could be significant income taxes to pay.
In higher net worth situations, the income tax basis adjustment at the spouse’s or child’s death may be limited, but, if the trust instrument is properly structured, in most situations the income tax basis adjustment will be significant, if not full.
Also significant is the fact that, in so-called “dynasty trust” situations, i.e., where the estate tax, divorce and lawsuit protections of accumulation trusts are intended to continue for future generations, this same federal income tax basis adjustment at each generation can continue for hundreds of years, if not forever.
