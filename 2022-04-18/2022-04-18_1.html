     Sen. Warren pushes TurboTax for answers about its efforts to block free tax filing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As millions of Americans file their 2021 income taxes online today, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is demanding answers from Intuit about its popular TurboTax e-filing product.
In a letter to Intuit CEO Sasan K. Goodarzi, Warren says the company has used “extensive lobbying and adroit influence peddling” to prevent Americans from filing their taxes for free online.
“scamming taxpayers into paying for services that should be free”Many of Warren’s complaints center on the Free File program, an IRS partnership with a nonprofit coalition of tax prep companies founded in 2003 to provide free tax services to low-income filers.
The companies also deliberately made the free versions of their software difficult to find in online search results, according to ProPublica.
Intuit left the Free File program in 2021.

     Lawmakers Go After TurboTax Over Free Filing on Tax Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US Federal Trade Commission also issued a complaint against Intuit's TurboTax software last month.
The commission alleged the company is deceiving consumers by calling its tax filing software "free" in ads but then "hitting them with charges when it's time to file."
Around 66% of all the tax filers weren't eligible to use the free TurboTax product in 2020, according to the FTC.
Warren, however, said in the letter that the Free File program, a partnership between the IRS and the tax filing software industry that offers free tax software to Americans earning $72,000 or less, "has been a failure" as "deceptive practices and outright sabotage from Free File companies" caused low rates of participation.
Intuit left the Free File program in 2021.

     On Tax Day, Elizabeth Warren accuses Intuit of manipulating tax filing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As millions of Americans scramble to file their taxes at the last minute, Senator Elizabeth Warren is asking why it isn't easier to do so for free.
Warren charges the maker of TurboTax software with lobbying against government efforts to create a truly free tax return option for Americans while sabotaging the public-private partnership that allows some Americans to file taxes without paying, called Free File.
However, less than 3% of taxpayers used it in the 2020 tax year, IRS figures show.
(Last year, TurboTax left the Free File Alliance.)
"Over the past eight years alone, Intuit's free tax preparation offering has helped nearly 100 million Americans file their taxes completely free of charge.

     Sen. Warren charges TurboTax with 'scamming taxpayers'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a letter to Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi, Warren, as well as Reps. Katie Porter and Brad Sherman, laid into the company over its TurboTax tax-filing program's fees.
According to the lawmakers, TurboTax offers products that "scam American taxpayers into paying for services that should be free."
At the core of their concern is the IRS' Free File program, through which TurboTax and other participants were supposed to offer tax preparation services to low-income Americans for free.
But the lawmakers described that program "a failure" due to underutilization, and noted that Intuit left the program last year.
For Warren, the letter is as much about getting answers to questions as it is about pushing companies to change their ways without government intervention.

     TurboTax’s Fight Against Free Tax Filing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was an actual box that you would buy with CDs in it with this tax prep software that you’d put on your desktop computer.
In the early 2000s, the George W. Bush administration decided to take a hard look at how tax prep worked.
But instead, millions and millions of people used the commercial “free” versions, such as Turbo Tax “free” edition.
This is used in other marketing contexts, not just tax prep, but I think it’s particularly salient in tax prep because so many people are nervous about getting it wrong.
We should note that Intuit voluntarily pulled its “free, free, free” TV ads on March 24.
