     Elizabeth Warren slams TurboTax for ‘crooked business practices’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s tax day in the U.S., and Americans are clawing their way through tedious tax filing systems and paying unnecessary fees (from sea to shining sea).
We may be the “land of the free,” but we aren’t necessarily land of the free file.
In 2003, the IRS introduced the Free File program along with a group of private tax prep companies.
The Free File system is supposed cover 70 percent of American taxpayers, but as of 2018, it’s used by just 3 percent of taxpayers each year.
In 2021 filers with an adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less are eligible for the Free Filing services, which are listed on irs.gov, but many end up using costly services like TurboTax.

     Lawmakers Go After TurboTax Over Free Filing on Tax Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US Federal Trade Commission also issued a complaint against Intuit's TurboTax software last month.
The commission alleged the company is deceiving consumers by calling its tax filing software "free" in ads but then "hitting them with charges when it's time to file."
Around 66% of all the tax filers weren't eligible to use the free TurboTax product in 2020, according to the FTC.
Warren, however, said in the letter that the Free File program, a partnership between the IRS and the tax filing software industry that offers free tax software to Americans earning $72,000 or less, "has been a failure" as "deceptive practices and outright sabotage from Free File companies" caused low rates of participation.
Intuit left the Free File program in 2021.

     Sen. Warren pushes TurboTax for answers about its efforts to block free tax filing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As millions of Americans file their 2021 income taxes online today, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is demanding answers from Intuit about its popular TurboTax e-filing product.
In a letter to Intuit CEO Sasan K. Goodarzi, Warren says the company has used “extensive lobbying and adroit influence peddling” to prevent Americans from filing their taxes for free online.
“scamming taxpayers into paying for services that should be free”Many of Warren’s complaints center on the Free File program, an IRS partnership with a nonprofit coalition of tax prep companies founded in 2003 to provide free tax services to low-income filers.
The companies also deliberately made the free versions of their software difficult to find in online search results, according to ProPublica.
Intuit left the Free File program in 2021.

     Sen. Elizabeth Warren accuses TurboTax of ‘shady business practices,’ flawed free file program
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warren, citing the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) lawsuit against Intuit filed in March, alleged that TurboTax’s Free File program scammed taxpayers into paying for services that should have been free.
"Free File was supposed to cover 70% of American taxpayers, but as of 2018, only approximately 3% of taxpayers participated each year," the letter read.
Over the past eight years alone, Intuit’s free tax preparation offering has helped nearly 100 million Americans file their taxes completely free of charge.
The company said it informed the agency on March 24 that "it would voluntarily ‘pull down the ‘free, free, free’ TV ads for the remainder of the tax season' in response to concerns that those advertisements were deceptive."
Intuit offered a free version of TurboTax through the IRS’ Free File Program for low-income filers until 2021, when they quit the program, saying they wanted to "focus on further innovating in ways not allowable under the current Free File guidelines."

     Sen. Warren charges TurboTax with 'scamming taxpayers'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In a letter to Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi, Warren, as well as Reps. Katie Porter and Brad Sherman, laid into the company over its TurboTax tax-filing program's fees.
According to the lawmakers, TurboTax offers products that "scam American taxpayers into paying for services that should be free."
At the core of their concern is the IRS' Free File program, through which TurboTax and other participants were supposed to offer tax preparation services to low-income Americans for free.
But the lawmakers described that program "a failure" due to underutilization, and noted that Intuit left the program last year.
For Warren, the letter is as much about getting answers to questions as it is about pushing companies to change their ways without government intervention.

     TurboTax’s Fight Against Free Tax Filing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It was an actual box that you would buy with CDs in it with this tax prep software that you’d put on your desktop computer.
In the early 2000s, the George W. Bush administration decided to take a hard look at how tax prep worked.
But instead, millions and millions of people used the commercial “free” versions, such as Turbo Tax “free” edition.
This is used in other marketing contexts, not just tax prep, but I think it’s particularly salient in tax prep because so many people are nervous about getting it wrong.
We should note that Intuit voluntarily pulled its “free, free, free” TV ads on March 24.
