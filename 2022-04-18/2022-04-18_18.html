     Browns Extension with Denzel Ward Makes Sense, but Carries Risk
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Cleveland Browns have made Denzel Ward the highest paid corner in the league.
The move is understandable, but may prove difficult for the Pro Bowl corner to justify.
There are a number of good reasons for the Cleveland Browns to pay Denzel Ward $100.5 million over five seasons, including $71.25 million guaranteed.
While the Browns aren't likely to regret giving Ward this contract, there are reasons to be concerned he might not live up to the lucrative contract.
It's also possible this past season is the best Ward has to offer.

     Browns signing CB Denzel Ward to five-year, $100.5M extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Denzel Ward has spent his entire life in Ohio.
Ward has agreed to a five-year, $100.5 million extension with the Cleveland Browns, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Monday.
Of the $100.5 million, $71.25 million is guaranteed, per Rapoport.
Ward has compiled a consistently effective career to this point, standing as one of only four players with 10-plus interceptions and 50-plus passes defensed since being drafted in 2018.
He's proven to be a blanket corner capable of staying in a receiver's hip pocket, thanks to his excellent speed, agility and fluidity that made him the fourth-overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.
