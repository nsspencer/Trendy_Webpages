    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steven Heap/EyeEm/Getty ImagesIt's finally here: April 18 is the 2021 federal tax filing deadline for most Americans.
What to know before filingIf you're planning to file your return, you can save money with IRS free file if your adjusted gross income is $73,000 or less for 2021, which is roughly 70% of taxpayers.
But mistakes may send your return into what the IRS calls "error resolution," requiring manual review, Campbell warned.
Your return should mirror any tax forms the IRS receives, such as your W-2, investment income and more.
You'll also want to double-check IRS letters for details on stimulus checks and advance child tax credit payments.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s tax day in the US, the deadline for most individuals to file and pay tax owed.
But while this year’s tax season may be closing for millions of Americans who are paid through a digital payment service such as PayPal, Venmo, Zelle and Cash App, the next tax year could come with even more complications.
Now, with the payment threshold reduced to $600, US taxpayers who have never seen a 1099-K will be receiving one.
No one knows how many Americans will be getting these forms, but tax lobbyists estimate the number at as high as 20 million.
“For the 2022 tax year, you should consider the amounts shown on your 1099-K when calculating gross receipts for your income tax return,” PayPal warns.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Suffolk County officials want its septic improvement program to be exempt from federal taxes.
Suffolk County Executive Steven Bellone said the program pays up to $30,000 to contractors directly to replace old systems with nitrogen-filtering septic tanks, and offers rebates to homeowners that have already footed the bill themselves.
He called on the IRS to provide tax relief for participating residents.
If it’s not tax exempt, Bellone warned similar programs around the country would struggle to find participants.
Richberg also called on the IRS to provide tax breaks to residents participating in the program, and return money to those who have been tax burdened in the past.

     Tax Day laggards: Consider filing for extension if in a rush
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON, D.C. — Millions of Americans wait until the last minute to file their taxes and this year is no exception.
Monday is Tax Day — the federal deadline for individual tax filing and payments — and the IRS will receive tens of millions of last-minute filings electronically and through paper forms.
For comparison, last year more than 169 million people completed an income tax return by the end of the year.
“An extension is merely filing a return at a later date,” Tross said.
When asked whether CPAs will accept clients on Tax Day, Kahn said it’s common for people to be turned away.

Why is Tax Day April 18?
For most Americans, the tax-filing deadline is April 18.
It isn’t April 15 because of the Emancipation Day holiday in Washington, D.C., and the subsequent weekend.
In Maine and Massachusetts, the deadline is April 19 because of the Patriots’ Day holiday.

MORE ON Tax Day in a bit, but first thanks for coming to the “you still have 14 to 18 hours to file for an extension” version of Morning Tax.
THE TAX DAY BIG PICTURE: As we noted, the filing season hasn’t been nearly as bumpy as it sounds like it could’ve been.
One of Ivey’s challengers, Lindy Blanchard, has proposed temporarily suspending all of Alabama’s 28-cent-per-gallon gas tax and is running television spots on that idea, after neighboring Georgia just paused its own gas tax through May.
Another challenger, Tim James, has said he wants to roll back the full gas tax increase from 2019, and Blanchard also says she wants to target parts of that law, which also provided for automatic increases in the gas tax.
