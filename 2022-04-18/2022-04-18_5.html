     How You Can Get More Time To File Your Crypto Taxes?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In simple terms, an extension is a special tax form (Form 4868) you can file with the IRS requesting additional time to file your individual tax return.
As the name suggests, a tax extension extends your tax filing due date from April 18th, 2022, to October 17, 2022.
If you overestimate taxes andpay more taxes than necessary with your extension, the IRS will refund you the excess taxes paid when you actually file your tax return.
If you underestimate your taxes and pay less taxes than required, you will have to pay the shortage when you actually file your tax return.
Next StepsFile for a tax extension if you canâ€™t file your final tax return by April 18th, 2022.
