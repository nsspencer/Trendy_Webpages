     'The Batman': Matt Reeves Confirms Easter Egg of Paul Dano's Riddler
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "You can actually see Paul Dano's Riddler in the window opposite the Iceberg Lounge, waiting, watching," wrote the fan, giving a shoutout to their friend who originally spotted the Easter egg.
Reeves’ interpretation of Batman, played by Robert Pattinson, takes the character back to his detective roots.
The Riddler was seemingly stationed outside the Iceberg Lounge to trace the movements of one of his victims—Gotham district attorney Gil Colson, played by Peter Sarsgaard.
Colson was brutally murdered by the Riddler outside the Iceberg Lounge, in his car.
Warner Bros. has big plans for Reeves’ Batman universe, with two sequels and two streaming series for HBO Max in the works.

     ‘The Batman’ on HBO Max: Five questions to ponder while watching
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions load“The Batman” is now officially streaming on HBO Max.
Whether this is your first viewing or the fifth, here are five things to ponder while watching “The Batman” on HBO Max.
Is ‘The Batman’ the sexiest Batman movie ever?
Could this Batman show up in one of those planned HBO Max spinoffs?
A Batman movie isn’t as big a deal if the Dark Knight is constantly available for other series, so an abundance of bat-appearances on HBO Max doesn’t seem in the cards.

     The Batman Passes Suicide Squad At Worldwide Box Office
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Batman officially passes Suicide Squad at the worldwide box office with over $750 million earned ahead of its HBO Max streaming debut.
Written and directed by David Ayer, Suicide Squad received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics for its unoriginal plot and lackluster direction while praise was aimed at the performances of its cast.
After encountering some COVID-related production issues, The Batman would hit theaters in March to rave reviews from critics and has now crossed a major box office mark.

Despite this, Suicide Squad is still the only DCEU film to have won an Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling.

     The Batman Predicts Our Grim Future: an Incels-vs.-Furries Civil War
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If you can piece together the clues, The Batman is an accurate predictor of 21st-century America’s worst-case scenario.
It predicts a civil war of incels versus furries.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
The Batman constantly draws parallels between Wayne and the Riddler; the two are a call-and-response act.
The Batman gives us an eerie vision of the young men who mobilize online to turn their sexual frustration/misogyny/racism into violence — and in some cases try to accelerate civil war.
