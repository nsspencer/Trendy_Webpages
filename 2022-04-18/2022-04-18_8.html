     Colin Kaepernick Reveals If He’s Willing To Be A Backup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Free-agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick is willing to be a backup quarterback if he’s signed by an NFL team.
Kaepernick has been working out on the field a lot lately and just wants to be given a chance.
So, if I have to come in as a backup, that’s fine,” Kaepernick said.
He’s already been in contact with the Seattle Seahawks during the offseason, but there’s been no for almost a month.
It still may be a long shot that Kaepernick plays in the NFL again, but that won’t stop him from hoping he gets a shot.

     49ers News: Colin Kaepernick gives rare on-camera interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Kaepernick doesn’t speak to the media very often, and he speaks on camera even less.
Despite that, however, Kaepernick was a guest on the I Am Athlete podcast, and the episode will drop later today on YouTube.
Many athletes have appeared on the I Am Athlete podcast in the past and gotten into some fascinating conversations that they might not have otherwise discussed in a traditional sit-down interview with a host.
Cam Newton said he went to New England because he was desperate, and DJ Williams admitted Josh McDaniels spied on other teams as head coach of the Broncos.
I’ll be fascinated to see if he talks about his experiences since he was blackballed.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier this month, former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick worked out for NFL scouts in an effort to jump-start a 2022 comeback.
"Five years of training behind the scenes," Kaepernick said, explaining that he "without question" desires to return to the NFL.
"You don't do that if you don't have a passion and you don't believe you're gonna find a way on that field."
And when I prove that I'm a starter, I wanna be able to step on the field as such.
1 ... (More importantly), the NFL is supposed to be a meritocracy."

     Summary: Colin Kaepernick is serious about wanting to return to the NFL, and he's willing to be a backup quarterback if that's what it takes to get back into the league.
Kaepernick hasn't played in the NFL since 2016, the same season he began kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice.
So if you're talking about the business side, it shows [it's] beneficial.
If you're talking about the playing side, come in, let me compete.
So, when you're talking about the people that are in the building, that has never come out that I've been a distraction.

Like, I'm going to be an NFL player and I'm going to win a Super Bowl.
I've been to the Super Bowl; we were one play away.
And I know that it may take different paths to get there, but I wholeheartedly believe I'm going to make that happen."
