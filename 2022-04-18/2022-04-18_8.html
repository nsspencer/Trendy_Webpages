     What is Patriots’ Day?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Patriots’ Day commemorates the Revolutionary War battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775.
The marathon began in 1897 (because of the coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 marathon was canceled and the 2021 running was held in October).
Patriots’ Day was celebrated on April 19 between 1897 and 1968 before becoming a statewide holiday in 1969, celebrated on the third Monday of April.
For many Bostonians, the holiday traditionally offers a doubleheader: the marathon almost always coincides with a Boston Red Sox game at Fenway Park.
This year, the Red Sox play the Twins, with the first pitch scheduled for 11:10 a.m. Eastern, as many runners will be on the marathon course.

     Massachusetts celebrates Patriots’ Day, service changes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (WWLP) – Monday marks Patriots’ Day in Massachusetts, a state holiday intended to honor the first battles of the Revolutionary War.
Naturally, Concord answered with a request of its own to observe the holiday as “Concord Day.” So, Governor Frederic Greenhalge compromised with “Patriots’ Day.” The actual anniversary of the battles is April 19, 1775.
In which may not be business as usual for your Monday errands, but Patriots’ Day is not a federally observed holiday, so disruptions won’t be like a typical holiday weekend.
There are service changes for PVTA routes, but Berkshire Regional Transit Authority and Franklin Regional Transit Authority are running as scheduled Monday.
Patriots’ Day also brings the annual running of the Boston Marathon.

     Summary: Millions of American will be marking Patriots’ Day on 18 AprilMillions of Americans celebrate Patriot’s Day - but what exactly does the holiday represent?
As a compromise, the day was called ‘Patriots’ Day’ to include all key battles in the region.
Massachusetts introduced the state holiday in 1894, while Maine adopted the state holiday in 1907.
The holiday is also punctuated in Maine as Patriot’s Day, rather than Patriots’ Day.
The Boston Red Sox are also always scheduled to play a home baseball match at Fenway Park every year on Patriots’ Day.
