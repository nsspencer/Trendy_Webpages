     Metro lifts mask mandate after federal court ruling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Metro lifted its mask requirement on Monday hours after a court voided the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s national travel mask mandate.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s decision comes as several public transportation agencies and airlines nationwide also lifted their mask requirements.
Monday’s ruling struck down the CDC rule requiring all travelers to wear masks on airplanes, buses, trains and other modes of public transportation.
Many major airlines – including Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Southwest Airlines – quickly dropped their requirements.
The Transportation Security Agency announced they would no longer enforce the mandate in light of the court’s ruling.

     Federal Judge Strikes Down Mask Mandate for Planes and Public Transit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Florida struck down the mask requirement on airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation on Monday, less than a week after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had extended it through May 3.
The ruling left it up to individual airlines and local transit agencies to decide what to do, and by late Monday, the nation’s largest airlines had dropped their mask requirements for domestic flights.
Because of the ruling, the masking order was not in effect for the time being, and the Transportation Security Administration would not enforce it, a Biden administration official said on Monday evening.
The official said that the administration was still reviewing the decision and assessing whether to appeal it, and that the C.D.C.
still recommended that people wear masks in enclosed public transportation settings.

     Summary: Some major U.S. airlines are dropping mask mandates for travelersEnlarge this image toggle caption Nam Y. Huh/AP Nam Y. Huh/APFollowing the news of a federal judge in Florida ruling against the Biden administration's mandatory mask mandate for travelers onboard airplanes and other forms of public transportation, airlines are reacting by lifting mask mandates.
On Monday, some of the major U.S. airlines — Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines — say that masks are now optional for travelers on their aircraft.
American Airlines, too, is following suit and is ending its mandatory mask requirement for travelers and staff at U.S. airports and on domestic flights.
However, on Monday, U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle ruled that the federal mask mandate on planes, trains, buses and other modes of public transportation is "unlawful."
The federal travel mask mandate will not be implemented as the Biden administration reviews a Mizelle's ruling against it.

     TSA will not enforce Covid mask mandate on planes, public transit after court ruling, White House says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks on public transit, a Biden administration official said.
The Transportation Security Administration will not enforce the mask mandate on public transportation, after a federal judge in Florida on Monday vacated the Biden administration's national Covid mask mandate for planes and other forms of public transportation, ruling that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had overstepped its authority.
United Airlines said in a statement that, effective immediately, masks would no longer be required on domestic flights or certain international flights.
The CDC mandate also applied to trains, buses, taxis and ride-shares among other forms of public transit.
The court's ruling comes less than a week after the CDC extended the mask mandate for 15 days, amid a rise in Covid infections nationwide due to the more contagious omicron BA.2 subvariant.

     TSA stops mask enforcement after federal judge voids mandate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Federal officials last week had extended the mask mandate for commercial flights and in other settings, including on buses, ferries and subways, until at least May 3.
On April 18, a federal judge in Florida struck down the federal mask requirement on airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation.
But the government’s argument that it put the mask requirement in place for the purpose of “sanitation” falls short, Mizelle argued.
“I still don’t understand a Florida judge reversing a federal mandate when the mandate is backed by as much science as it is,” he said.
Some passengers cheered as JetBlue Airways staff announced that the transportation mask mandate had been struck down by a federal judge in Florida on April 18.
