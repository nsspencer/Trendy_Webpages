     Strained calf to keep Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic out for Game 2 against the Utah Jazz
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS -- Luka Doncic is again out for the Dallas Mavericks in Game 2 of their playoff series against the Utah Jazz, even though coach Jason Kidd said the young superstar guard is continuing to make progress in his recovery from a strained left calf.
Monday's Game 2 comes eight days after Doncic got hurt in the regular-season finale.
Doncic has resumed individual shooting, and even swished a half-court shot during the team's walk-through Monday morning.
But he's young.
Dallas is 8-10 without Doncic this season, including the Game 1 loss to the Jazz.

I used to play in a bunch of these kind of games in Europe as well, in a heated atmosphere.
We play all year to get those seedings and get home court advantage just for this moment.” — Utah Jazz star Bojan Bogdanovich.
Game 3 is Thursday at Vivint Arena in Salt Lake City, while Game 4 is Saturday, also in Utah.

     O'Sullivan's Monday NBA Playoff Picks: Toronto Raptors at Philadelphia 76ers, Utah Jazz at Dallas Mavericks
    </h2>

     Summary: Toronto Raptors at Philadelphia 76ers, 7:30 pm EasternThe Pick: Toronto +7.5 (-110), bet $16.50 to win $15Philadelphia really put it to Toronto on Saturday, winning by 20 points.
I thought it was a must-win for Philadelphia because Matisse Thybulle won’t be playing the games in Toronto.
But the Raptors won’t put up the stinkbomb they put up two days ago, and the Sixers’ natural inclination will be to relax, even just a little bit.
Utah Jazz at Dallas Mavericks, 8:30 pm EasternThe Pick: Dallas +5.5 (-110), bet $16.50 to win $15My rationale is the same in this game.
The difference between the Mavericks and the Raptors is, the Mavericks had every chance to win on Saturday and they blew it.
