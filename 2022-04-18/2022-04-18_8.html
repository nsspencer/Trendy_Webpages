     Federal Judge Strikes Down Mask Mandate for Planes and Public Transit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Florida struck down the mask requirement on airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation on Monday, less than a week after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had extended it through May 3.
The ruling left it up to individual airlines and local transit agencies to decide what to do, and by late Monday, the nation’s largest airlines had dropped their mask requirements for domestic flights.
Because of the ruling, the masking order was not in effect for the time being, and the Transportation Security Administration would not enforce it, a Biden administration official said on Monday evening.
The official said that the administration was still reviewing the decision and assessing whether to appeal it, and that the C.D.C.
still recommended that people wear masks in enclosed public transportation settings.

     Metro lifts mask mandate after federal court ruling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Metro lifted its mask requirement on Monday hours after a court voided the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s national travel mask mandate.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s decision comes as several public transportation agencies and airlines nationwide also lifted their mask requirements.
Monday’s ruling struck down the CDC rule requiring all travelers to wear masks on airplanes, buses, trains and other modes of public transportation.
Many major airlines – including Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Southwest Airlines – quickly dropped their requirements.
The Transportation Security Agency announced they would no longer enforce the mandate in light of the court’s ruling.

     TSA will not enforce Covid mask mandate on planes, public transit after court ruling, White House says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks on public transit, a Biden administration official said.
The Transportation Security Administration will not enforce the mask mandate on public transportation, after a federal judge in Florida on Monday vacated the Biden administration's national Covid mask mandate for planes and other forms of public transportation, ruling that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had overstepped its authority.
United Airlines said in a statement that, effective immediately, masks would no longer be required on domestic flights or certain international flights.
The CDC mandate also applied to trains, buses, taxis and ride-shares among other forms of public transit.
The court's ruling comes less than a week after the CDC extended the mask mandate for 15 days, amid a rise in Covid infections nationwide due to the more contagious omicron BA.2 subvariant.

     Summary: TSA will no longer enforce travel mask mandate after a federal judge strikes it downEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThe federal travel mask mandate will not be implemented as the Biden administration reviews a Florida federal judge's ruling against it.
"Therefore, TSA will not enforce its Security Directives and Emergency Amendment requiring mask use on public transportation and transportation hubs at this time."
U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle ruled that the federal mask mandate on planes, trains, buses and other modes of public transportation is "unlawful."
"The court concludes that the mask mandate exceeds the CDC's statutory authority and violates the procedures required for agency rulemaking under the APA," the judge wrote.
The White House called a federal judge's decision against the CDC mandate for public transportation "disappointing," but said the administration's response was still under review.

“So thank you and happy unmasking day!”New York City’s public transit system planned to keep its mask requirement in place.
The mask requirement covered airlines, airports, mass transit and taxis, and was the biggest vestige of pandemic restrictions that were once the norm across the country.
The federal mask requirement for travelers was the target of months of lobbying from the airlines, which sought to kill it.
