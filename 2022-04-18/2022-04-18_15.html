     Summary: A former resident of West Hollywood faces sentencing Monday for supplying the fentanyl-laced pills that led to rapper Mac Miller’s fatal overdose four years ago.
Ryan Reavis, 39, pleaded guilty last year to a federal count of distribution of fentanyl, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
On Sept. 4, 2018, at the direction of Walter, Reavis supplied counterfeit oxycodone pills to the third defendant, according to papers filed in Los Angeles federal court.
Miller began rapping at 14 and built a large following before signing with the label of fellow Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa.
Miller released five studio albums and a series of mix tapes during his career.

     Mac Miller Drug Dealer Sentenced to Nearly 11 Years in Prison

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of the three drug dealers charged in the deadly fentanyl overdose that claimed the life of rising rapper Mac Miller was sentenced to nearly 11 years in prison on Monday.
In addition to his prison time, Reavis also was sentenced to three years of supervised release with drug testing.
Stephen Andrew Walter, 48, took a plea deal carrying a 17-year prison sentence last October, admitting he supplied the fentanyl-laced pills to Reavis.
The feds allege Pettit agreed on Sept. 4, 2018, to supply McCormick with 10 oxycodone pills as well as cocaine and the sedative Xanax.
When he made the delivery on Sept. 5, Pettit allegedly gave McCormick the counterfeit oxycodone pills that contained fentanyl instead.
