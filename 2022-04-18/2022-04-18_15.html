     Chronicle photographer recalls capturing 'the photo' of Norman's 1996 Masters collapse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: From Staff reportsGoing into the final round of the 1996 Masters Tournament, Australia's Greg Norman held a six-shot lead over Englishman Nick Faldo.
But Faldo's charge, coupled with Norman's second-nine collapse that Sunday, ended with Faldo winning his third green jacket, five strokes ahead of runner-up Norman.
A panel of Augusta Chronicle photographer Matthew Craig's images of the moment of Norman's collapse ran on top of that headline.
18, I handed off my film to a runner to take back to the lab while we waited to photograph the walk up to the green and the green jacket ceremony.
