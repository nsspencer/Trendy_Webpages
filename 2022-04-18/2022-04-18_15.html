     Doja Cat Debuts New Song "Vegas" &amp; Performs With Rico Nasty At Coachella: Watch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last night, Doja Cat played what must be the biggest show of her career thus far ‚Äî a spot on the Coachella mainstage just before headliners the Weeknd and Swedish House Mafia.
She also threw in a couple of surprises, including a pair of new songs and appearances from collaborators Rico Nasty and Tyga.
Early in her set, Doja debuted ‚ÄúVegas,‚Äù introducing the song by saying that she did it for the soundtrack of Baz Luhrmann‚Äôs forthcoming movie Elvis.
The track interpolates ‚ÄúHound Dog‚Äù ‚Äî the Big Mama Thornton version, not the Elvis one ‚Äî and uses the song for extremely Doja Cat purposes.

     Doja Cat's First Official Coachella Performance, Brings Tyga On Stage
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Play video content TMZ.comDoja Cat had her first solo performance at Coachella, and she brought Tyga to the stage to perform one of their hits.
The recent Grammy winner got her own lineup spot Sunday, and the crowd was loving every minute ... along with her hits, she performed a new song, "Vegas," which is in Baz Luhrmann's new Elvis movie.
At one point, she started her song, "Juicy," but couldn't do it alone ... bringing fellow artist Tyga to the stage to collab.
She also brought up Rico Nasty for their song, "Tia Tamera."
Doja joined Rico at the festival back in 2019, but this is the first year she's been given her own slot -- fitting to bring Rico back on the stage after she did the same for her years ago.

Here are the five best things we saw at the first weekend of Coachella 2022.
That level of joy, especially these days, is infectious: their small-stage tent revival is ready for a mid-day mainstage blowout already.
Doja Cat: When Ye dropped out of the schedule for Coachella, among the names rumored to replace him was Doja Cat, who would have just needed to scootch up the bill one line.
His first appearance at Coachella in 2015 felt like the unveiling of a future superstar; by the end of his second, he seemed more like the best secret you‚Äôve ever been able to keep.
