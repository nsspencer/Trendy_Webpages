     Summary: Unbeknownst to the world until minutes ago, we find ourselves less than a month away from Kendrick Lamar’s fifth studio album, Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers, set to release on May 13.
“The following statement was released today by oklama, through his company, pgLang at 11:00am PT in Los Angeles, CA,” it read.

In November, Lamar put on a theatrical performance at Day N Vegas, highlighting his musical journey from Section.80 to DAMN.

He and Keem took home the Grammy for Best Rap Performance last month for “Family Ties.”“Nothing could prepare me for this moment tonight,” Keem said when accepting the award.

     Summary: Apart from a small number of guest appearances and live sets, Kendrick Lamar has kept quiet these last few years — but it seems the Pulitzer Prize-winning artist is returning with another album next month.
According to a cryptic new press release, Lamar will release “Mr.
Morale &amp; the Big Steppers” on May 13.
There have even been several false alarms, such as a social media frenzy ignited last summer by his record label TDE, but that turned out to be a tease for the Isaiah Rashad album.
Morale &amp; the Big Steppers” turns out to be Lamar’s long-awaited fifth full album, sources say it is his last through TDE.

     Kendrick Lamar Reveals New Album Title &amp; Release Date
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The rap megastar has been keeping an extremely low profile in preparation for his final album on Top Dawg Entertainment and now, we not only have a name but an actual release date to expect new music!
It appears King Kunta has settled on the album title "Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers" ... with an expected release date of May 13.
In the brief message, Kendrick is adamant he will be the only source for information regarding the album.
After launching in 2020, all appears to be going well: pgLang's flagship artist, Baby Keem, just took home a Grammy for Best Rap Performance for the Kendrick duet, "Family Ties."
With so much talk about artists not sustaining an audience due to low streams and sales, Kendrick could ignite a jolt in rap, much like he's done several before.
