    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Steven Heap/EyeEm/Getty ImagesIt's finally here: April 18 is the 2021 federal tax filing deadline for most Americans.
What to know before filingIf you're planning to file your return, you can save money with IRS free file if your adjusted gross income is $73,000 or less for 2021, which is roughly 70% of taxpayers.
But mistakes may send your return into what the IRS calls "error resolution," requiring manual review, Campbell warned.
Your return should mirror any tax forms the IRS receives, such as your W-2, investment income and more.
You'll also want to double-check IRS letters for details on stimulus checks and advance child tax credit payments.

     Here's what to know about filing for an extension on your tax returns
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For those who have either procrastinated or been unable to send in their tax returns by Monday's deadline, the IRS says filing for an extension might be the best option.
The simplest way to file for an extension is to go to the IRS Extension page and use its Free File page to estimate your tax liability and pay any amount due before midnight on April 18.
Although this extension will give taxpayers until October 17, 2022 to complete their returns, they must pay taxes owed by the original due date or face penalties, according to the IRS.
While overestimating your income might have you pay more taxes initially, you'll receive any refund when you complete your filing by the October extension deadline.
For your state-specific tax questions you can visit the Federation of Tax Administrators to find your state's specific tax extension procedures.
