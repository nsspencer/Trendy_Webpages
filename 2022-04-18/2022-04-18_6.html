     Summary: Riots erupt in Sweden over rallies by an anti-Islam groupEnlarge this image toggle caption Johan Nilsson/AP Johan Nilsson/APHELSINKI (AP) — Swedish police said they fired warning shots during a riot in an eastern city to disperse protesters angry about demonstrations over the past several days by a Danish anti-Islam group in Sweden.
Paludan and his Stram Kurs party had planned a demonstration in Norrkoping on Sunday but he never showed up in the city, Swedish media reported.
In Landskrona, southern Sweden, a few hundred mostly young people threw stones and set cars, tires and dustbins on fire.
Paludan, a Danish lawyer who also holds Swedish citizenship, set up Stram Kurs, or "Hard Line" in 2017.
The website of the party, which runs on an anti-immigration and anti-Islam agenda, says "Stram Kurs is the most patriotic political party in Denmark."

     3 hurt, 25 arrested in unrest over far-right demonstrations in Sweden
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadSwedish police said Monday that they had arrested 25 people, including eight minors, in two cities during a weekend of confrontations across Sweden spurred by Koran-burning rallies held by a far-right, anti-Islam Danish group.
ArrowRight On Sunday, police said three people were slightly injured in the eastern city of Norrkoping after being hit by police bullets during a clash.
The arrests announced Monday took place in Norrkoping and nearby Linkoping, to the southwest.
On Sunday, Paludan posted on social media that he would cancel demonstrations in Norrkoping and Linkoping because police had shown that they were “incapable” of protecting themselves and Paludan.
In 2018, the nationalist and right-wing populist Sweden Democrats, a group with neo-Nazi origins, won about 18 percent of the vote in Sweden’s general election.

     Sweden links riots to criminal gangs that target police
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Sweden, a nation of 10 million, has seen unrest, scuffles, arson and violence since Thursday that has left some police officers and protesters injured.
“We suspect that those involved (in the riots) have links to criminal gangs,” National Police Commissioner Anders Thornberg told a news conference on Monday, adding some of those “criminal individuals” are known to police.
Since Thursday, in addition to Malmo, riots, unrest and violent clashes have been reported in Stockholm, the central city of Orebro, the eastern cities of Linkoping and Norrkoping and southern town of Landskrona.
Thornberg, Sweden’s supreme police chief, said “criminal individuals” who took advantage of the situation with Paludan’s Swedish Easter tour and joined the riots, were the main suspects for the violent flare-ups of violence.
In Iran, dozens of students gathered Monday at Sweden’s embassy to protest Paludan’s planned Quran burnings.
