     49ers News: Colin Kaepernick gives rare on-camera interview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Colin Kaepernick doesn’t speak to the media very often, and he speaks on camera even less.
Despite that, however, Kaepernick was a guest on the I Am Athlete podcast, and the episode will drop later today on YouTube.
Many athletes have appeared on the I Am Athlete podcast in the past and gotten into some fascinating conversations that they might not have otherwise discussed in a traditional sit-down interview with a host.
Cam Newton said he went to New England because he was desperate, and DJ Williams admitted Josh McDaniels spied on other teams as head coach of the Broncos.
I’ll be fascinated to see if he talks about his experiences since he was blackballed.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s no secret Colin Kaepernick is still looking for a chance to play in the NFL, despite last suiting up in 2016.
Kap actually did a workout recently with a couple of Seattle Seahawks players and there were even rumors they were potentially interested in him.
Via PFT:“No team’s brought me in for a workout,” Kaepernick said.
But they don’t have a starter right now.”It’s actually insane that essentially no team has even explored the idea of signing Kaepernick.
The Seahawks could definitely use another signal-caller in the QB room though, with Drew Lock expected to be the starter right now.

     Summary: In the interview, Kaepernick addresses several lingering questions that seem to be keeping him from getting an opportunity with an NFL team.
I need to finish that.”Brandon Marshall asked Kaepernick if he’s willing to take a minimum-salary position in order to get back in the door.
Five years ago, the league decided that the cost of doing business with Kaepernick outweighs the benefit.
Unless and until it does, he’s not getting the opportunity that he has deserved every single day for more than 1,800 days.
