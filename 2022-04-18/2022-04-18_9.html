     Can You Believe It? Jalen Brunson 41 Points Leads Dallas Mavs Over Utah Jazz in Game 2
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The shorthanded Dallas Mavericks went into Game 2 hoping for any kind of offensive spark they could get after losing Game 1 to the Utah Jazz, 99-93 – a game where they shot just 4-of-18 on wide-open 3-pointers.
From the Mavs' lips to God's ears, Dallas indeed found some of those sparks in the play of Jalen Brunson and Maxi Kleber at American Airlines Center on Monday night.

The Mavs completely flipped the script from Game 1 to Game 2 by hitting 17 uncontested 3s in the win.
Whether it happens or not, one thing is for sure, the Mavs are as confident as they've ever been.

     Jalen Brunson, Maxi Kleber help Dallas Mavericks even series against Utah Jazz with Luka Doncic out
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jalen Brunson steps up with 41 points to lead the Mavericks to a 110-104 win and even the series in Luka Doncic's absence.
(2:00)DALLAS -- The formula the Dallas Mavericks used to pull off their series-evening 110-104 win in Monday's Game 2 felt painfully familiar to the Utah Jazz.
"The good thing is it's Game 2," Jazz center Rudy Gobert said.
One of the primary problems the Jazz need to solve is figuring out whether anybody on the roster is capable of staying in front of Mavs point guard Jalen Brunson.
The biggest beneficiary was Mavs reserve center Maxi Kleber, who scored 25 points on 8-of-11 3-point shooting.
