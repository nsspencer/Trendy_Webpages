     Summary: I did not rape anybody,” Walker, 27, exclaimed as he was led away in handcuffs after the jury departed.
“We feel that with this verdict, the jury gave these victims back their voices,” Wallace tells Rolling Stone.
One was model Jada Everon, who spoke to Rolling Stone after the verdict and gave permission to use her full name.
But I’m disappointed about the verdicts,” Flier tells Rolling Stone.
The woman had no idea who her assailant was until she got a rape exam and the DNA in her vaginal cavity matched to Walker, Wallace said.
