     Summary: A former resident of West Hollywood faces sentencing Monday for supplying the fentanyl-laced pills that led to rapper Mac Miller’s fatal overdose four years ago.
Ryan Reavis, 39, pleaded guilty last year to a federal count of distribution of fentanyl, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
On Sept. 4, 2018, at the direction of Walter, Reavis supplied counterfeit oxycodone pills to the third defendant, according to papers filed in Los Angeles federal court.
Miller began rapping at 14 and built a large following before signing with the label of fellow Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa.
Miller released five studio albums and a series of mix tapes during his career.
