    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Trout (hand) underwent an MRI on Monday which confirmed he didn't suffer a fracture when hit by a pitch Sunday, and athletic trainer Mike Frostad said the center fielder's return to the lineup will be a matter a of pain tolerance, Jeff Fletcher of The Orange County Register reports.

Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels left Sunday’s game against the Texas Rangers after being hit in the left hand by a pitch in the fifth inning.
Trout brought his hand directly into the path of the pitch as he tried to duck out of the way, which was a bit of a fluke play.
Trout may have misjudged the pitch (81 mph slider) out of Spencer Patton’s hand and was preparing for a fastball based on the way he moved.
Anaheim was 5-4 in the early going heading into Sunday’s game.

Trout added that he will start wearing a protective pad on his left hand.
Shohei Ohtani, a left-handed hitter, wears one on his right hand, which he needs to protect so he can pitch.
The Angels needed Rosenberg to provide some coverage for the bullpen because both Jaime Barria and Jimmy Herget had pitched two innings on Sunday.
The Angels selected Rosenberg in the minor league portion of the Rule 5 draft last year.
