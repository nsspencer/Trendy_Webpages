     Storm Expected to Bring Heavy, Wet Snow to Northeast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Go here for the latest on the spring snowstorm.
An early spring storm is expected to bring heavy snow to the interior Northeast, particularly New York, on Monday into Tuesday, raising the potential for downed trees, power interruptions and difficult travel, forecasters said.
In New York State, which is expected to get the brunt of the storm, snowfall of up to 11 inches is possible in some northern counties, according to the National Weather Service.
A mix of rain and snow was expected to spread into much of Central New York and Northeastern Pennsylvania on Monday evening, and change to snow in many areas before tapering Tuesday morning, forecasters said.

     Winter storm warning with several inches of snow possible for Ithaca area
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Wet and heavy snow” is likely Monday evening through Tuesday late morning, says the National Weather Service in Binghamton, which has issued a winter storm warning for much of its coverage area.
Tompkins County is on the western edge of the storm warning zone, with an advisory in effect for counties further west.
A “reasonable worst-case scenario” factoring in a shift in the storm track and a potential for heavy snow bands puts Ithaca in a zone that could see 8-12 inches of snow.
Meteorologist Drew Montreuil from Finger Lakes Weather expects such a heavy snow band means “snowfall rates over 2 inches per hour will be likely.
On the flip side, if the band just misses the area, snow amounts could be limited to a couple inches.”For more, follow 14850.com on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter or subscribe to the 14850 Magazine Daily newsletter.
