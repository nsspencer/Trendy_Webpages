     Mexican Pizza is back: Taco Bell to relaunch popular menu item in May
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A popular Taco Bell dish will soon be back on the menu.
The fast food chain announced Monday it will relaunch the Mexican Pizza, which it removed in late 2020 as part of plans to streamline its menu.
Taco Bell said since then, fans have been pushing to get Mexican Pizza back.
"Mexican Pizza has a long history with the brand and I'm glad we could give fans what they crave and bring our classic Mexican Pizza back home where it belongs," Taco Bell CEO Mark King said in a statement.
Additionally, Taco Bell said a mystery prize given to rewards members during the Super Bowl in January is a free Mexican Pizza.

     Summary: IRVINE, Calif. (WXIN) — A Mexican Pizza-sized hole in the diets (and hearts) of Taco Bell fans will soon be filled.
The taco chain announced that the Mexican Pizza is returning to the menu on May 19 — for good!
