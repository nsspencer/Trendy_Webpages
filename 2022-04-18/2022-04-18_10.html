     Mexican Pizza Is Finally Returning to the Taco Bell Menu
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: When Taco Bell dropped its Mexican Pizza from menus in November 2020, it was hard to tell if the chain knew exactly what kind of reaction they would face.
This morning, Taco Bell revealed that the Mexican Pizza will return on May 19, 2022 — though loyalty members will be able to score one early, starting on May 17.
"Our menu is full of fan-favorites, but the Mexican Pizza is at the top of that list," Mark King, Taco Bell's CEO, stated in the announcement.
"From its flashy introduction to menus in 1985 as 'Pizzazz Pizza' to its inspiration behind the creation of infamous jingles, Mexican Pizza has a long history with the brand and I'm glad we could give fans what they crave and bring our classic Mexican Pizza back home where it belongs."
Among others, Taco Bell credited Mexican Pizza fan Krish Jagirdar — who launched the Change.org petition that eventually racked up over 200,000 signatures — as a key player in the pizza's return.
