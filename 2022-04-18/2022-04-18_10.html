     Summary: A Florida judge overturns the CDC's mask mandate for planes and other public transitEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesA federal judge in Florida has ruled that the federal mask mandate on planes, trains, buses and other modes of public transportation is "unlawful."
U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle wrote in a summary filed Monday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has exceeded its authority and failed to follow proper rulemaking procedures in requiring passengers and employees to wear face coverings while in transit.
Just last week, the agency extended the transportation mask mandate (which had been set to expire originally on April 18) through May 3 — allowing officials to take more time to study the BA.2 subvariant of COVID-19.
The mask-wearing requirement had been initially imposed in early 2021, shortly after President Joe Biden took office in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.

     TSA will not enforce Covid mask mandate on planes, public transit after court ruling, White House says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal judge in Florida on Monday vacated the Biden administration's national Covid mask mandate for planes and other forms of public transportation, ruling that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had overstepped its authority.
The Transportation Security Administration will not enforce the mask mandate on public transportation after the court's ruling, a Biden administration official said.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki, in a press conference Monday, said the administration is reviewing the court's ruling and the Justice Department will determine whether it will appeal.
The CDC mandate also applied to trains, buses, taxis and ride-shares among other forms of public transit.
The court's ruling comes less than a week after the CDC extended the mask mandate for 15 days, amid a rise in Covid infections nationwide due to the more contagious omicron BA.2 subvariant.

     Judge Strikes Down Biden Mask Mandate for Planes, Transit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: April 18, 2022 – A federal judge in Florida has struck down the Biden administration’s mandate that travelers on airlines, buses, trains, and other public transit wear masks.
The mandate, enacted in February 2021, is unconstitutional because Congress never granted the CDC the power to create such a requirement, U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle said in her order issued Monday.
“Congress addressed whether the CDC may enact preventative measures that condition the interstate travel of an entire population to CDC dictates.
The Biden administration has extended the mask mandate several times since it was first announced.
Lawsuits have been filed over the mandate, but Mizelle ruled in favor of two people and the Health Freedom Defense Fund, who filed suit in July 2021.

     Florida court overturns CDC mask mandate for planes and trains, calling it ‘unlawful’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The CDC has renewed the travel mask mandate several times, most recently extending it through May 3.
The suit alleged that the CDC mandate was “arbitrary and capricious,” since it gave exemptions to certain groups — like children under 2 years old — but not others.
They said the mask mandate was a conventional sanitation measure within the CDC’s authority.
The CDC continues recommending wearing a mask on public transit,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a Monday briefing.
Judge Mizelle, who once clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, was appointed to the Middle District of Florida bench in 2020 by President Donald Trump.
