     Steph Curry Reveals What Makes Jordan Poole Special
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors have a rising star in Jordan Poole.
After the game, Steph Curry was asked about what many are calling his young clone.
With the play of Poole, it has been easier for the Warriors to ease Steph Curry back from his injury, as the team has another dynamic scorer to shoulder some of the offensive load.
According to Curry himself, it is the all-around aspect of Poole's offensive arsenal that makes him so special.

     Summary: Behind a 44-point 3rd quarter, the Golden State Warriors blew the Denver Nuggets out of the building in a decisive Game 2 win.
While that 3rd quarter flurry was happening, Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant shared his thoughts on Golden State's dominance:It was a dominant frame for the Warriors, who were raining threes from all over the court.
At the end of three quarters, Steph Curry had 26 points, Klay Thompson had 18 points, and Poole had 26 of his own.
While Golden State was favored in this series, there were some question marks surrounding Curry's helath, and the overall cohesion of a team that has had limited time on the floor together this season.

One of the most improved players in the entire NBA, Jordan Poole was somehow left off of the list of the three finalists for this year’s Most Improved Player award, leading to his teammates and coaches being just as puzzled as the rest of the NBA world.
“If Jordan Poole isn't the Most Improved Player, then the NBA really needs to relook at their process.

     Summary: The Warriors have never lost an NBA playoff series when Curry, Thompson and Green are in every game from the start.
Their incredible 14-0 run began in 2015, when the Warriors went 4-0 in playoff series and saw the core start every game.
So how are Curry, Thompson and Green able to thrive when the pressure is at its peak?
“I play off Steph, Steph plays off Draymond,” Thompson said.
Their undefeated record when starting playoff series together will be put to the test should the Warriors advance to the Western Conference Semifinals with Curry back as a starter.

     Summary: Steph Curry has had a long two years since he was last lighting up the NBA playoffs.
“To be in this environment after [this] two-year absence from the playoffs, it means a lot,” Curry said.
Curry missed the last month of the season after suffering a foot injury against the Boston Celtics on March 16.
“I’m blessed to be able to get back at this time,” Curry said.
But if Game 2 was any indication, Curry is just as lethal coming off the bench – and he’s enjoying the return to basketball’s biggest stage.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — Stephen Curry had a lot to shimmy about Monday night in the Warriors’ dominant 126-106 win over the Denver Nuggets.
As the Nugget called a timeout to regroup, Curry emphatically yelled something along the lines of “I’m back” at the crowd.
The Warriors’ three-guard lineup, of Curry, Jordan Poole and Klay Thompson, was just as lethal Monday as it was in Saturday’s game.
Golden State closed out the second quarter on a 22-8 run with that trio sharing the court to give the Warriors a 57-51 lead at the half.
The Warriors own a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series and are scheduled to travel to Denver later this week, where they’ll play Game 3 on Thursday and Game 4 Sunday.
