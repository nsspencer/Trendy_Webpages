     Federal Judge Strikes Down Mask Mandate for Planes and Public Transit
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Florida struck down the mask requirement on airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation on Monday, less than a week after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had extended it through May 3.
The ruling left it up to individual airlines and local transit agencies to decide what to do, and by late Monday, the nation’s largest airlines had dropped their mask requirements for domestic flights.
Because of the ruling, the masking order was not in effect for the time being, and the Transportation Security Administration would not enforce it, a Biden administration official said on Monday evening.
The official said that the administration was still reviewing the decision and assessing whether to appeal it, and that the C.D.C.
still recommended that people wear masks in enclosed public transportation settings.

     TSA will not enforce Covid mask mandate on planes, public transit after court ruling, White House says
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A federal judge in Florida on Monday vacated the Biden administration's national Covid mask mandate for planes and other forms of public transportation, ruling that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had overstepped its authority.
The Transportation Security Administration will not enforce the mask mandate on public transportation after the court's ruling, a Biden administration official said.
However, the CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks on public transit, the official said.
The CDC mandate also applied to trains, buses, taxis and ride-shares among other forms of public transit.
The court's ruling comes less than a week after the CDC extended the mask mandate for 15 days, amid a rise in Covid infections nationwide due to the more contagious omicron BA.2 subvariant.

     Summary: TSA will no longer enforce travel mask mandate after a federal judge strikes it downEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThe federal travel mask mandate will not be implemented as the Biden administration reviews a Florida federal judge's ruling against it.
"Therefore, TSA will not enforce its Security Directives and Emergency Amendment requiring mask use on public transportation and transportation hubs at this time."
U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle ruled that the federal mask mandate on planes, trains, buses and other modes of public transportation is "unlawful."
"The court concludes that the mask mandate exceeds the CDC's statutory authority and violates the procedures required for agency rulemaking under the APA," the judge wrote.
The White House called a federal judge's decision against the CDC mandate for public transportation "disappointing," but said the administration's response was still under review.

airlines have been strong advocates for eliminating pandemic-era policies and are encouraged by the lifting of the federal transportation mask mandate,” the group said.
The suit alleged that the CDC mandate was “arbitrary and capricious,” since it gave exemptions to certain groups — like children under 2 years old — but not others.
They said the mask mandate was a conventional sanitation measure within the CDC’s authority.
The CDC continues recommending wearing a mask on public transit,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a Monday briefing.

     TSA stops mask enforcement after federal judge voids mandate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Federal officials last week had extended the mask mandate for commercial flights and in other settings, including on buses, ferries and subways, until at least May 3.
The transportation mandate has been among the highest-profile mask requirements in the country, persisting after most school districts and other jurisdictions have allowed similar mandates to expire.
The mask mandate did not wear heavily on their minds.
“I still don’t understand a Florida judge reversing a federal mandate when the mandate is backed by as much science as it is,” he said.
Last month, executives from 10 airlines, including American, United and Delta, sent a letter to Biden urging him to end pandemic-related travel policies, including the mask mandate.
