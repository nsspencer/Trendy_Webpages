     Steph Curry Reveals What Makes Jordan Poole Special
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors have a rising star in Jordan Poole.
After the game, Steph Curry was asked about what many are calling his young clone.
With the play of Poole, it has been easier for the Warriors to ease Steph Curry back from his injury, as the team has another dynamic scorer to shoulder some of the offensive load.
According to Curry himself, it is the all-around aspect of Poole's offensive arsenal that makes him so special.

     Steph Curry Proclaims He's Back after 34-Point Night Vs. Nuggets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Popping up off of the ground, Curry uttered three words to a raucous Chase Center crowd; “I’m fucking back.”With 34 points coming off of the bench for the Golden State Warriors, Curry, indeed, appeared to be back to his high-scoring and game-controlling self.
Helping lift the Warriors to a dominant 126-106 win in Game 2 over the Denver Nuggets in their first-round playoff matchup, Curry is looking like himself again.
“The first game, missing that much time, coming off the bench and trying to get used to the speed of the game again,” Curry said.
Dropping 34 points, Curry shot the ball at a 70-percent clip.
What is more promising for Golden State is that Curry is responding well to his return and his foot is holding up in the process.

     Summary: The Warriors have never lost an NBA playoff series when Curry, Thompson and Green are in every game from the start.
Their incredible 14-0 run began in 2015, when the Warriors went 4-0 in playoff series and saw the core start every game.
So how are Curry, Thompson and Green able to thrive when the pressure is at its peak?
“I play off Steph, Steph plays off Draymond,” Thompson said.
Their undefeated record when starting playoff series together will be put to the test should the Warriors advance to the Western Conference Semifinals with Curry back as a starter.

     Steph Curry: Warriors feed off Jordan Poole's confidence, energy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As the Warriors Postgame Live crew asked Steph Curry about Jordan Poole after the Warriors routed the Denver Nuggets 126-106 in Game 2 on Monday to take a 2-0 lead in the first round series, Poole crashed Curry’s courtside interview before he could answer.
“It’s just amazing, just in terms of his confidence, his ability to create, make tough shots, make open shots, make plays for other people,” Curry said.
The three-guard lineup of Curry, Poole and Klay Thompson torched the Nuggets, going on a 22-6 run to close the first half and start the second half.
It turned a six-point halftime lead into an easy-going blowout for most of the second half as the Warriors cruised to a 2-0 series advantage.
Curry, who is used to playing with Thompson and Draymond Green in big playoff moments, now has another tool in Poole to add to the equation.

Golden State used runs of 16-0 and 23-4 late in the second quarter to erase a 43-31 deficit and take a 57-51 lead at the break.
The Nuggets went ahead 43-31 on Monte Morris’ layup at the 7:25 mark of the second quarter and the Warriors answered with 16 straight points.
… Denver committed costly turnovers once more, 18 of them leading to 25 Warriors points — something Malone stressed couldn’t happen.
Warriors: Curry, Poole and Thompson combined to go 31 for 52 from the floor with 13 3s.

     Summary: SAN FRANCISCO — Stephen Curry had a lot to shimmy about Monday night in the Warriors’ dominant 126-106 win over the Denver Nuggets.
As the Nugget called a timeout to regroup, Curry emphatically yelled something along the lines of “I’m back” at the crowd.
The Warriors’ three-guard lineup, of Curry, Jordan Poole and Klay Thompson, was just as lethal Monday as it was in Saturday’s game.
Golden State closed out the second quarter on a 22-8 run with that trio sharing the court to give the Warriors a 57-51 lead at the half.
The Warriors own a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series and are scheduled to travel to Denver later this week, where they’ll play Game 3 on Thursday and Game 4 Sunday.

But then the Warriors just started raining 3-pointers and by the time halftime rolled around Golden State was up 57-51.
Whether it was Curry, Thompson, Poole or Wiggins, Denver just simply couldn't match the offensive firepower.
Murray alone would've given the Nuggets another viable scoring option alongside Jokic to at least contend with the Warriors.
