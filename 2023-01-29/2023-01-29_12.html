     Cowboys just gifted Buccaneers the perfect OC candidate after shocking firing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Richard Rodriguez/Getty Images)The Dallas Cowboys might have ended the Tampa Bay Buccaneers season, but they just handed them the best gift of the offseason.
According to The Dallas Morning News, the Cowboys are handing play calling duties to head coach Mike McCarthy.
That means Kellen Moore is the odd man out, and left holding the bag for the Cowboys’ collapse against the 49ers last week.
Shortly after news of Moore’s firing was announced, Rapoport connected him to the Buccaneers and their vacant offensive coordinator position.

     Chargers interested in former Cowboys OC Kellen Moore
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Sunday evening, the Cowboys made a surprise move by agreeing to part ways with offensive coordinator Kellen Moore.
Moore joined the Cowboys staff in 2018 after retiring from the NFL.
As a member of the Cowboys roster for the previous three seasons, Moore’s transition into coaching was unsurprisingly smooth as he was immediately hired as the team’s quarterback coach.
Former #Cowboys OC Kellen Moore is expected to speak with the #Chargers for their OC opening, per me and @TomPelissero.
A newly available coordinator, Moore should figure prominently.

     Summary: Moore joined the club in 2015 as a reserve quarterback, and by 2019 was the team's offensive coordinator.
Kellen Moore will not return as the Dallas Cowboys' offensive coordinator, according to a report Sunday from David Moore of the Dallas Morning News.
Jason Garrett promoted Moore to offensive coordinator in 2019, and Mike McCarthy retained him in the post upon his 2020 hiring.

     Summary: The time for rejoicing has come for most fans as Offensive Coordinator Kellen Moore is gone.
Breaking: Mike McCarthy to call plays as Cowboys part ways with offensive coordinator Kellen Moore https://t.co/iM1fRODH3G January 29, 2023After a poor performance against the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round of the 2022 NFL Playoffs, it seems that the Cowboys have had enough of Moore's playcalling.

About a week ago, Moore interviewed with the Carolina Panthers for their head coaching vacancy.
Kellen Moore had the opportunity to be a coach at his alma mater, Boise State, before accepting the job at Dallas.

     Cowboys part ways with OC Kellen Moore, HC Mike McCarthy to assume play-calling duties in Dallas, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Turns out that someone is Kellen Moore, the team's offensive coordinator for the last four seasons since 2019.
However, Moore can end up following in the footsteps of another fired offensive coordinator this offseason, Mike LaFleur.
LaFleur, the New York Jets offensive coordinator in 2021 and 2022 who was fired early after the Jets missed the playoffs, quickly landed on his feet as the new Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator.
According to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Los Angeles Chargers both have interest in Moore filling their open offensive coordinator roles.
Moore also benefited from Prescott's rebound, reaching the finalist stage in the Miami Dolphins head coaching search before Miami went with 49ers offensive coordinator Mike McDaniel instead.

     Summary: The Cowboys and OC Kellen Moore have mutually agreed to part ways after four seasons at the position, NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero reported Sunday.
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reports that Moore is expected to speak with the Los Angeles Chargers for their OC opening, per a source.
