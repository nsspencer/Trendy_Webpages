     Micah Parsons trolls Deebo Samuel over 49ers‚Äô playoff exit

     Summary: Micah Parsons trolls Deebo Samuel over 49ers‚Äô playoff exitMicah Parsons got his opportunity for revenge over the weekend ‚Ä¶ sort of.
Deebo Samuel and the San Francisco 49ers saw their season end on Sunday with a disappointing 31-7 defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC title game.
He reacted to the 49ers‚Äô elimination by tweeting a photo of Samuel with the caption, ‚ÄúMhmm who Deebo poke?

Parsons and the Cowboys lost to Samuel and the 49ers in last week‚Äôs divisional playoff round, and the two trade barbs online afterwards.

     Christian McCaffrey reminds Deebo Samuel of himself, 49ers star shares
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The duo of Deebo Samuel and Christian McCaffrey has been effective, to say the least, since the latter arrived in the Bay Area in late October.
"It kind of reminds me of last year how I could go from receiver to running back to receiver," Samuel told Irvin.
Ever since McCaffrey was traded from the Carolina Panthers to San Francisco, Samuel has effused the running back's praises, especially with how McCaffrey has stepped up in crucial moments for the 49ers.
With the dynamic duo of Samuel and McCaffrey, the 49ers rattled off 10 straight wins to conclude the 2022 NFL regular season.
Considering how effective the combination of Samuel and McCaffrey has been, it stands to reason that Shanahan will continue using both players as dual threats.

     Micah Parsons was quick to call out Deebo Samuel after Eagles‚Äô beatdown of 49ers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The high-fives had not even been handed out following Philadelphia‚Äôs win over San Francisco Sunday before Micah Parsons had social media fired up.
And it was because the former Harrisburg High and current Dallas Cowboys star didn‚Äôt waste the opportunity to throw a little social media shade at Niners star wideout Deebo Samuel.
But don‚Äôt put me in this weak (behind) slide.‚ÄùWell, after the Eagles roughed up San Francisco Sunday, Parsons posted a photo of a cell phone with Samuel‚Äôs face on it.
Still, it was obvious he didn‚Äôt mind seeing Deebo and the Niners take the ‚ÄúL‚Äù.
It‚Äôs probably one of the few times a Cowboys player has truly enjoyed seeing the Eagles win.

     Summary: Recently, he has been spotted lugging around a glimmering "NBF" chain.
Why does Deebo Samuel wear an 'NBF' chain?
Samuel's chain pays homage to his tightest companions, the homies that might as well be blood relatives.
So much so, it seems, that he bought each of them a matching "NBF" chain.

     Cowboys‚Äô Micah Parsons throws gasoline on feud with 49ers‚Äô Deebo Samuel
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons was busy on Twitter on Sunday night, first praising Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson for his ‚Äúheroic‚Äù effort in a 31-7 victory over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game.
But Parsons wanted a little payback, too: He trolled Niners wide receiver Deebo Samuel, with whom he has a running feud.
Before the Niners beat the Cowboys in a divisional playoff game, Parsons had said the Cowboys wanted to play the Niners.
When the 49ers won, Samuel posted a message to Parsons: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt poke the bear!‚ÄùParsons fired back that Samuel hadn‚Äôt done much in the game.
Parsons‚Äô season, of course, ended a week before Samuel‚Äôs.

     Micah Parsons trolls Deebo Samuel on social media after Niners loss to Eagles
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Although the rivalry between Dallas and San Francisco is historic, in the last two years the losses to the Bay Area team have had a strong impact on the Texans.
He returns the "courtesy" on social mediaIt all started when before the game between Cowboys and 49ers, Micah said they wanted to play against San Francisco, and after they beat Dallas, Samuel posted on Instagram Parsons' comments and added the phrase: "Don't poke the bear".
Parsons didn't stay quiet and responded: "Lol what did you do today fam lol?!
Several Niners fans wrote to Parsons telling him that he was already at home, not realizing that the Niners will also be watching the Super Bowl at home.
This appears to be just the beginning of a new chapter in one of the NFL's oldest and most important rivalries.
