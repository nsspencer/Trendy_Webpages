     Paris Saint-Germain vs. Stade de Reims
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Paris Saint-Germain's mediocre run in Ligue 1 continued as they fell to a last-gasp 1-1 draw at home against Stade de Reims after being reduced to 10 men on Sunday.
Reims are 11th on 26 points after stretching their Ligue 1 unbeaten run to 12 games.
It prompted coach Christophe Galtier to substitute Vitinha with Verratti in midfield and the Italy international had an immediate impact as PSG finally applied some pressure.
In the 51st minute, Messi's shot was deflected into the path of Neymar, who dribbled past Yehvann Diouf before poking the ball home.
Tempers flared after the final whistle as a scuffle erupted between staff members of both sides.

     Summary: It was the 21-year-old forward’s 11th league goal of the season and one less than PSG’s scorer Neymar.

“We abandoned our defense.”AdvertisementSince the World Cup, PSG has won only two of its five league games and both have been against strugglers.
With a much tougher test against Bayern Munich approaching in the round of 16 of the Champions League, PSG needs to improve fast.

     USMNT target Folarin Balogun scores dramatic late goal, denies PSG win as Reims earn deserved draw
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Folarin Balogun's late equalizer denied Paris Saint-Germain the win and kept Stade de Reims' impressive 14-game unbeaten run going on Sunday in a 1-1 draw.
The hotshot showed great composure to round Gianluigi Donnarumma before finishing clinically to spark wild celebrations on the away bench.
We quickly gave up our defense in the face of a team that is now unbeaten in 14 games.
"Our first half was insufficient and we were fortunate to score so quickly in the second half.
Reims' late equalizer came after nearly six minutes of time added on which is latest goal PSG have conceded in Ligue 1 since at least 2006-07.

     PSG 1-1 Reims: Folarin Balogun bags late goal to deny PSG after Neymar strike
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Arsenal loanee Folarin Balogun struck an added-time equaliser for Reims to deny the 10 men of Paris Saint-Germain a winning return to Ligue 1.
The hosts had to weather an early storm from Reims with Balogun twice drawing Donnarumma into a save before Marshall Munetsi forced the home goalkeeper into an instinctive one-handed stop.
And they got their reward with Balogun notching his 11th goal of an impressive season – fully deserved after a lively showing.
Verratti is also shown a yellow card for a late and rash tackle on Ita in the build-up.

     Ten-man PSG held as dogged Reims strike late
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On-loan Arsenal striker Folarin Balogun ran through to score a remarkable 96th-minute equaliser as Reims held 10-man Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain to a 1-1 draw on Sunday.
It looked like Neymar's strike early in the second half would be enough for PSG to take all three points despite substitute Marco Verratti being sent off shortly after that goal.
But an impressive Reims side got the draw they richly deserved when Balogun broke away to fire home right at the death.
- Neymar scores, Verratti sent off -Yet they sorely missed Verratti in midfield with the Italian left on the bench in the first half as Reims looked the more dangerous side.
PSG then saw Sergio Ramos head off the bar before Hakimi had a goal disallowed for offside.
