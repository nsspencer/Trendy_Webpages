The episode fleshes out — spoilers — the romantic relationship between Bill and Frank, something only hinted at in the video game.
It was an incredible thing to watch his chemistry with Murray Bartlett was incredible.
You know, we cast Murray Bartlett, and then a few months later, Murray Bartlett wins an Emmy (for HBO's The White Lotus.)
The Last of Us episode 3, "Long Long Time," premieres January 29th on HBO and HBO Max.

     How The Last of Us Pulled Off One of the Decade's Greatest TV Episodes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We're introduced to the bearded survivalist, Bill (Nick Offerman), and a man named Frank (Murray Bartlett), who mistakenly stumbles upon Bill's lonely, quarantined kingdom.
A nearly hour-and-a-half long bottle episode spanning 20 years, feeling very much like Shakespeare tried his quill at a post-apocalyptic tale.
Offerman and Bartlett, two superb performers in their own right, join forces—singing, cooking, fighting, crying, and loving their way through what's easily one of this young decade's best episodes of television.
So we called up the director of the episode, Peter Hoar (The Umbrella Academy, Daredevil), to get the behind-the-scenes treatment.
And Nick was nervous, not because he was in bed with a man, but nervous because it meant so much.

     The Last of Us Episode 3: Joel and Ellie continue their journey West
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new episode - entitled Long Long Time - introduces two new characters, Bill, played by Nick Offerman, and Frank, played by Murray Bartlett.
The episode also continues the journey West by Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey), following a touching sacrifice in last week's episode.
Joel calls for Bill and Frank but no one answers, as Joel telling Ellie to stay there and to yell if anything happens.
Joel asks and Ellie affirms, reading the letter to Joel.
The preview for next week's episode teases a first look at Melanie Lynskey's character Kathleen as Joel and Ellie keep heading West in their new truck.
