     Summary: MELBOURNE, Australia -- Novak Djokovic is a 10-time Australian Open champion.
Novak Djokovic defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets in the 2023 Australian Open final.
It's not the head start you want to give Djokovic in a Slam final.
Novak Djokovic celebrates after winning his 10th Australian Open title.
For Tsitsipas, it's a second Slam final appearance without a win, but regardless, he'll move up one spot to world No.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Novak Djokovic found this trip to Australia far less complicated, and far more successful, than that of a year ago.
“I would like to thank you for pushing our sport so far,” Tsitsipas told Djokovic.
Little doubt this is of no solace to Tsitsipas, but there is no shame in failing to defeat Djokovic in Melbourne.
Djokovic pushes and pushes and pushes some more, until it’s the opponent who is something less than perfect on one swing, either missing or providing an opening to pounce.
Still, Srdjan Djokovic did not attend his son’s semifinal or the final.

     Novak Djokovic claims 10th Australian Open title, 22nd Slam
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MELBOURNE, Australia — (AP) — Novak Djokovic climbed into the Rod Laver Arena stands to celebrate his 10th Australian Open championship and record-tying 22nd Grand Slam title Sunday and, after jumping and pumping his fists with his team, he collapsed onto his back, crying.
This was also the 93rd ATP tour-level title for Djokovic, breaking a tie with Nadal for the fourth-most.
Too speedy and flexible on the run (other than when, moving to his left, Djokovic took a tumble).
Yet Djokovic pushes and pushes and pushes some more, until it’s the opponent who is something less than perfect on one swing, either missing or providing an opening to pounce.
Still, Srdjan Djokovic did not attend his son’s semifinal or the final.

     Novak Djokovic beats Stefanos Tsitsipas to win 10th Australian Open title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The historic implications of this match certainly did not shackle Novak Djokovic as the Serb beat Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets to win a 10th Australian Open title and a record-equaling 22nd grand slam.
After securing the 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-5) victory, Djokovic went to the players’ box and uncontrollably sobbed, the significance and emotion of his achievement overcoming him.
Last year, Djokovic was unable to defend his title after being deported from the country over his Covid-19 vaccination status.
Djokovic last lost at the Australian Open in 2018, a winning streak that spans 28 matches.
When Tsitsipas hit a return long, the title for Djokovic was secured.

     Novak Djokovic, the Hard-Court King, Conquers His Tenth Australian Open
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Sunday, in Melbourne, at the Australian Open, he won his twenty-second major—his tenth on one court, Rod Laver Arena, the main show court in Melbourne Park.
(He displaces the young Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, who is injured and was forced to skip the Australian Open.)
In set three, with Djokovic serving at 6–5 in the tiebreak—championship point—he drove a forehand to Tsitsipas’s forehand corner, and Tsitsipas, on the stretch, sailed one last forehand long.
Australian Open officials had banned the display of Russian and Belarusian flags.
Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia wanted Srdjan stripped of his Australian Open accreditation.
