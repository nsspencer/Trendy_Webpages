    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Things got ugly between the 49ers and Eagles at the end of Sunday’s NFC Championship game.
With 4:13 left and the Eagles dominating their eventual 31-7 win, 49ers offensive tackle Trent Williams slammed Philadelphia safety K’Von Wallace to the ground during a skirmish, causing both benches to clear as officials tried to keep things from escalating further.
Both Williams and Wallace were ejected from the game.
The 49ers’ Trent Williams and Eagles’ K’Von Wallace were ejected in the fourth quarter after a fight broke out on the field.
However, fourth-stringer Josh Johnson suffered a concussion, and Purdy had to come back into the game in the second half.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NFC Championship Game between the Eagles and 49ers got a bit chippy as Philadelphia continued to chew clock off en route to a 31-7 Super Bowl berth.
In the final minutes of the fourth quarter, both teams piled up into a skirmish on the field following a 6-yard run by Christian McCaffrey.
The pushing and shoving split into two different piles, and tempers really flared in the pile closest to midfield that featured 49ers star tackle Trent Williams and Eagles safety K'Von Wallace.
Flags flew and officials ordered both teams to their respective sidelines, while also announcing that Williams and Wallace had been ejected from the game.
Johnson then suffered a concussion, which led to the 49ers with no healthy quarterback to try to help them contend in the NFC title game.

     49ers' Trent Williams ejected after slamming Eagles player in scuffle, benches clear in response
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Francisco 49ers All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams lost his cool during a scuffle during the NFC Championship Game on Sunday, slamming a Philadelphia Eagles player, which led to his ejection late in the fourth quarter.
The scuffle began when 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel and Eagles safety K’Von Wallace had each other’s facemasks in their hands following a play.
Williams was fed up with Wallace and grabbed him from behind, throwing him to the ground, and the scuffle almost turned into something worse.
49ERS' BROCK PURDY FORCED BACK INTO NFC CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER LEAVING WITH ELBOW INJURYMost of the frustration centered around the offense’s struggles after losing starting quarterback Brock Purdy due to an elbow injury.

As for Wallace’s status for Super Bowl LVII, the disqualification would not carry over to that game, unless he was suspended by the league.
