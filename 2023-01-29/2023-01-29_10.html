    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The NFC Championship Game between the Eagles and 49ers got a bit chippy as Philadelphia continued to chew clock off en route to a 31-7 Super Bowl berth.
In the final minutes of the fourth quarter, both teams piled up into a skirmish on the field following a 6-yard run by Christian McCaffrey.
The pushing and shoving split into two different piles, and tempers really flared in the pile closest to midfield that featured 49ers star tackle Trent Williams and Eagles safety K'Von Wallace.
Flags flew and officials ordered both teams to their respective sidelines, while also announcing that Williams and Wallace had been ejected from the game.
Johnson then suffered a concussion, which led to the 49ers with no healthy quarterback to try to help them contend in the NFC title game.
