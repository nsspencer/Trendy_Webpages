     Novak Djokovic: 'I Don't Have Intention To Stop Here'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Novak Djokovic made history once again Sunday when he clinched a record-equalling 22nd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open.
Following his record-extending 10th Australian Open crown, the 35-year-old revealed that the fire to achieve more burns as bright as ever.
Let's see how far I go.”Djokovic's Message To The Fans:The Serbian captured his maiden Australian Open title aged 20 in 2008 before he rose to No.
I played some of my best tennis honestly in [this] Australian Open.
With Sunday’s win, Djokovic improved to 11-2 in his ATP Head2Head series against Tsitsipas, having also defeated the 24-year-old Greek in the Roland Garros final in 2021.

     Advantage, Novak Djokovic in the race to be tennis' GOAT
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MELBOURNE, Australia -- There's an inevitability about Novak Djokovic playing tennis at Rod Laver Arena.
For the third time in his career, Djokovic dropped just one set along his journey to an Australian Open title.
Novak Djokovic won his 10th Australian Open title on Sunday, the most by any player.
While Djokovic is the favorite to end his career with the most men's Grand Slam titles, it shouldn't be the only measure used when considering tennis' GOAT.
But if nobody ever strikes a tennis ball again, you'd be hard-pressed to not have Djokovic at the top of the pile.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Novak Djokovic found this trip to Australia far less complicated, and far more successful, than that of a year ago.
“I would like to thank you for pushing our sport so far,” Tsitsipas told Djokovic.
Little doubt this is of no solace to Tsitsipas, but there is no shame in failing to defeat Djokovic in Melbourne.
Djokovic pushes and pushes and pushes some more, until it’s the opponent who is something less than perfect on one swing, either missing or providing an opening to pounce.
Still, Srdjan Djokovic did not attend his son’s semifinal or the final.

     Novak Djokovic claims 10th Australian Open title, 22nd Slam
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MELBOURNE, Australia — (AP) — Novak Djokovic climbed into the Rod Laver Arena stands to celebrate his 10th Australian Open championship and record-tying 22nd Grand Slam title Sunday and, after jumping and pumping his fists with his team, he collapsed onto his back, crying.
This was also the 93rd ATP tour-level title for Djokovic, breaking a tie with Nadal for the fourth-most.
Too speedy and flexible on the run (other than when, moving to his left, Djokovic took a tumble).
Yet Djokovic pushes and pushes and pushes some more, until it’s the opponent who is something less than perfect on one swing, either missing or providing an opening to pounce.
Still, Srdjan Djokovic did not attend his son’s semifinal or the final.

     Novak Djokovic beats Stefanos Tsitsipas to win 10th Australian Open title
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The historic implications of this match certainly did not shackle Novak Djokovic as the Serb beat Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets to win a 10th Australian Open title and a record-equaling 22nd grand slam.
After securing the 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-5) victory, Djokovic went to the players’ box and uncontrollably sobbed, the significance and emotion of his achievement overcoming him.
Last year, Djokovic was unable to defend his title after being deported from the country over his Covid-19 vaccination status.
Djokovic last lost at the Australian Open in 2018, a winning streak that spans 28 matches.
When Tsitsipas hit a return long, the title for Djokovic was secured.
