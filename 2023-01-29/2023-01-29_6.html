     Jimmy Garoppolo could return for 49ers Super Bowl behind Purdy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo could very well make a return to the team’s lineup this postseason if the team makes it to the Super Bowl.
NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport said Sunday that if the 49ers beat the Eagles, then Garoppolo could return to practice and be listed as Brock Purdy’s backup.
The Super Bowl will be held two weeks from now.
Head coach Kyle Shanahan talked about a "way outside chance" of a return in the postseason before the playoffs started.
Garoppolo was on the field in pads for the first Super Bowl of the Shanahan era; it would only make sense for him to be there on the second appearance.

     Jimmy Garoppolo injury update: 49ers QB out for NFC title game, could begin practicing if they win, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers haven't lost a game since Brock Purdy became the starting quarterback after Jimmy Garoppolo went down with a broken foot in December.
When asked about his injury Friday, Garoppolo said to The Athletic his status is "still up in the air" moving forward, should the 49ers win the NFC title game.
All 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan has mentioned regarding Garoppolo's status was that he "didn't expect him available this week."
Garoppolo went 7-3 in his 10 starts for the 49ers, completing 67.2% of his passes for 2,437 yards with 16 touchdowns to four interceptions for a 103.0 passer rating.
This is Purdy's team now, but having Garoppolo as an insurance policy isn't a bad thing.

     Will Jimmy Garoppolo be available for the NFC Championship Game?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers face the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday in the 2023 NFC Championship Game, and quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo will be inactive.
Ian Rapoport reported Sunday morning that Garoppolo could begin practicing this week if the 49ers advance to the Super Bowl, but he is unavailable for the NFC title game.
Garoppolo is the only other quarterback on the 49ers active roster with Trey Lance still on injured reserve.
Lance had a second surgery on his ankle in December and will not be returning until the 2023 regular season.
Garoppolo is a free agent in the offseason and appears on track to be fully healthy when he hits the market in early March.

#49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo won’t be active today, but sources say based on scans of his ankle this week, he’s finally at a point where practicing is possible.
Despite entering the 2022 offseason with his back against the wall, as San Francisco sought to promote young quarterback Trey Lance to a starting position, Jimmy G was the team’s savior.
However, it’s no longer Garoppolo or even Lance that San Francisco is relying on but Purdy, “Mr.
Nonetheless, should Garoppolo be needed for any reason, he could be available during Super Bowl.

     49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo could return to practice this week, back up Brock Purdy in Super Bowl LVII

     Summary: Rapoport adds that if Garoppolo was to play there would some obvious risk, but the scenario is conceivable.
In five regular-season starts, Purdy threw for 1,374 yards, 13 touchdowns and four interceptions.
His play has only gotten better in the playoffs, totaling 546 passing yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions in two wins.
Of course, Garoppolo suiting up for Super Bowl LVII is predicated on Purdy continuing his unbeaten streak on Sunday in Philadelphia.
Purdy would then become the first rookie quarterback to win a conference championship game (and advance to the Super Bowl) in league history, per NFL Research.
