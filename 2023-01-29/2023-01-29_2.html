ETLocation: State Farm Stadium (Glendale, Arizona)TV: Fox | Stream: fuboTV (try for free)Odds: Eagles -2, O/U 49.5How the contenders got hereThe road to the Super Bowl is paved long before the start of the season.
Key matchupsChiefs TE Travis Kelce vs. Eagles S C.J.
Eagles WR DeVonta Smith vs. Chiefs CB Jaylen Watson: The latter has had a busy postseason, picking off both Trevor Lawrence and Joe Burrow.
PredictionThis was the best possible Super Bowl matchup of the four possibilities going into Championship Sunday, partly for the connections between the two sides -- the Reid vs. Philly and Kelce vs. Kelce angles -- but mostly because it pits one ultra-reliable offense against another.
