     Fabinho Survives VAR Red Card Review For Ugly Foul That Injured Brighton's Evan Ferguson
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reds midfielder Fabinho was arguably lucky not to be sent off for an ugly foul on Evan Ferguson.
Fabinho only entered the game as an 85th-minute substitute but he was immediately at the center of the action.
The Brazilian's first involvement was to foul Brighton's Evan Ferguson, who was forced to leave the field with an injury as a consequence.
Fabinho pictured fouling Evan Ferguson during Liverpool's 2-1 defeat at Brighton ITV FootballReferee David Coote was quick to show Fabinho a yellow card but Fabinho was made to sweat as a VAR review considered whether an upgrade to red was required.
A red card would have resulted in Fabinho being banned from Liverpool's next three matches.

     Brighton 2-1 Liverpool LIVE: Mitoma with stunning INJURY-TIME strike to knock out holders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I thought it was a good cup tie, end to end and both had chances.
We created chances and were more compact but at the end of the day we are out of the cup.
"At a club like Liverpool, fans expect a lot and to lose with the last kick of the ball it's disappointing.
We need to start winning games.
That it doesn't help the fans, I'm sorry for them and the way we are putting on a show.
