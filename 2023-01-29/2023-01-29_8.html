     The Last of Us Season 1 Episode 3 Recap: Frank, My Dear
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It is way too soon to talk about The Last of Us’s third episode, “Long Long Time,” as the best episode of 2023, let alone the best episode of The Last of Us, right?
Is it too soon to declare it the best episode of 2023 and The Last of Us, so far?
Following an opening two installments that demonstrated astounding fidelity to the video game it’s based on, The Last of Us breaks the mold with its riveting third episode, a 75-minute meditation on life and love in the not-quite-a-zombie apocalypse.
Of course, by the episode’s end, “Long Long Time” also manages to leave the audience completely wrecked.
The episode begins in the aftermath of a different wreck: Tess (Anna Torv), gone but not forgotten following her explosive sacrifice play.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I was thinking about what happened and nobody made you go along with this plan,” Ellie tells Joel.
Frank tells him that the quarantine zone is completely gone, and Bill lets him out of a hole after testing to see if he’s infected.
Begrudgingly, Bill lets him inside and offers a shower, a new set of clothes, and a home-cooked meal.
“I was never afraid before you showed up,” Bill tells Frank.
Even though, you know, the town Bill made kept two people safe for nearly two decades.

     The Last of Us episode 3 is the ‘San Junipero’ of zombie stories
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No, “San Junipero” doesn’t have anything to do with zombies, and “Long, Long Time” doesn’t have anything to do with uploading your personality to an endless 1980s club scene.
Back in 2016, everyone I knew was watching “San Junipero,” talking about how they hadn’t watched “San Junipero” yet, or telling me I should watch “San Junipero,” the fourth episode of the third season of Black Mirror.
Eventually, I watched “San Junipero.” It was lovely!
Did you enjoy what “San Junipero” did for bisexual and lesbian sci-fi fans?
note: The rest of this piece contains broad spoilers for “Long, Long Time.”]Also Joel and Ellie are there too, I guess, but whatever.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet to me, a fan of the games, it still felt like a faithful adaptation of what made the games so good.
At one point, when you’re playing as Joel, Ellie is struggling emotionally.
The Last of Us’ third episode, “Long Long Time,” is seemingly self-contained.
At the end of the episode, Joel and Ellie stumble into Bill and Frank’s house long after the lovers have died.
And, for Joel, Bill assumes it’s Joel’s partner, Tess, not knowing that she died at the end of the previous episode.

     Summary: As they make their way to Frank and Bill’s, Joel responds to Ellie’s question about whether or not they’re nice.
It’s also home to a broken Mortal Kombat II machine, a game Ellie knows well even though she’s almost certainly never played it.
“This is you,” Frank says before he begins butchering “Long, Long Time,” the song that gives the episode its title.
25 on the Billboard Hot 100, “Long, Long Time” comes from Ronstadt’s second solo album, 1970’s Silk Purse.

     Summary: As they keep walking, they see a crashed plane, and Ellie asks about Outbreak Day, and how the world basically fell apart in a day.
The pair laugh at their choice, then Frank asks Bill to take him to bed.
While Joel goes to investigate and finds Bill and Frank’s bedroom barricaded, Ellie finds a letter from Bill with a car key on top.
While there’s no battery in the truck, Joel finds the ingredients to make one in the refrigerator.
Returning to the house, Joel asks to see Ellie's arm, which still hasn’t changed.
