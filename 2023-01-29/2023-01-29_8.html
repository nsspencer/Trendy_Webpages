Joey Bosa, the older brother of 49ers defensive lineman Nick Bosa, is in Philadelphia to support San Francisco as it attempts to win the NFC championship and a Super Bowl berth.

     Eagles fan goads Joey Bosa into shouting match before 49ers game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Somehow, Joey Bosa didn’t get the memo about Philadelphians.
Bosa, a Chargers linebacker and the older brother of 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa, was seen getting into it with an obnoxious Eagles fan in South Philly ahead of Sunday’s NFC title game.
The man began filming Joey Bosa and shouting his name while Bosa, wearing a Niners jacket, was waiting in line to get into the game.
Because I’m f—king rich, you f—king broke bitch,” Bosa yelled, in full game mode simply to spectate.
A very uncomfortable-seeming woman in 49ers gear shot a tight-lipped smile to the crowd and ushered Bosa into the stadium.

     Joey Bosa happily posed for pictures while wearing 49ers gear before his brother's NFC title game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa swapped out his Charger blue for San Francisco 49ers red to support his brother at Sunday’s NFC championship game.
49ers defensive end Nick Bosa had a game Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles, so Joey Bosa decided to rock his sibling’s colors as the elder Bosa traveled to the aptly named City of Brotherly Love to cheer his younger brother on.
While he was there, Joey Bosa mingled with 49ers fans and even found a young Niners fan and took a picture with him.
While Joey Bosa is no stranger to controversy, it’s nice to see him do something classy like cajole with fans of his brother’s team.
Maybe it’ll be Nick Bosa returning the favor next year if the Chargers can push for a 2024 AFC championship berth.

Bosa shouldn’t be surprised that cell phone video ended up on social media, given the language he used to describe said Eagles fans.

     Chargers DE Joey Bosa wears 49ers gear on sideline at NFC championship
    </h2>

     Summary: All eyes are on the 49ers and Eagles in the NFC championship game and legends from both clubs are in the building at Lincoln Financial Field.
Mixed in with team icons mingling on the sidelines is Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa, who’s there supporting his younger brother, Nick.
The elder Bosa didn’t wear Chargers gear to the game.
He was on the sideline before the game donning a 49ers jacket over a white hoodie.
His Chargers were eliminated in the wild card round by the Jacksonville Jaguars, and he’s now apparently become a 49ers fan the rest of the way.
