     Cowboys just gifted Buccaneers the perfect OC candidate after shocking firing

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (Photo by Richard Rodriguez/Getty Images)The Dallas Cowboys might have ended the Tampa Bay Buccaneers season, but they just handed them the best gift of the offseason.
According to The Dallas Morning News, the Cowboys are handing play calling duties to head coach Mike McCarthy.
That means Kellen Moore is the odd man out, and left holding the bag for the Cowboys’ collapse against the 49ers last week.
Shortly after news of Moore’s firing was announced, Rapoport connected him to the Buccaneers and their vacant offensive coordinator position.

     Summary: Todd Archer reacts to Kellen Moore being out as the Cowboys' offensive coordinator.
(1:45)FRISCO, Texas -- Kellen Moore will no longer be the offensive coordinator of the Dallas Cowboys, ending a four-year run that saw the offense rank inside the top 10 three times.
The last Cowboys coach to call plays was Jason Garrett in 2012.
A source said the Los Angeles Chargers recently requested permission to speak to Moore about their offensive coordinator opening.
The Cowboys were able to keep defensive coordinator Dan Quinn, who removed his name from head-coaching consideration elsewhere.

     Summary: The time for rejoicing has come for most fans as Offensive Coordinator Kellen Moore is gone.
Breaking: Mike McCarthy to call plays as Cowboys part ways with offensive coordinator Kellen Moore https://t.co/iM1fRODH3G January 29, 2023After a poor performance against the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round of the 2022 NFL Playoffs, it seems that the Cowboys have had enough of Moore's playcalling.
Kellen Moore has been the Cowboys' offensive coordinator since 2019.
About a week ago, Moore interviewed with the Carolina Panthers for their head coaching vacancy.
Kellen Moore had the opportunity to be a coach at his alma mater, Boise State, before accepting the job at Dallas.

     Cowboys OC Kellen Moore out as head coach Mike McCarthy will take over play-calling in Dallas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Turns out that someone is Kellen Moore, the team's offensive coordinator for the last four seasons since 2019.
I want to thank Kellen for his deep commitment, hard work and dedication that were a core part of his time with the Cowboys," head coach Mike McCarthy said in a statement.
Moore may end up following in the footsteps of another fired offensive coordinator this offseason, Mike LaFleur.
LaFleur, the New York Jets offensive coordinator in 2021 and 2022 who was fired early after the Jets missed the playoffs, quickly landed on his feet as the new Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator.
Moore also benefited from Prescott's rebound, reaching the finalist stage in the Miami Dolphins head coaching search before Miami went with 49ers offensive coordinator Mike McDaniel instead.
