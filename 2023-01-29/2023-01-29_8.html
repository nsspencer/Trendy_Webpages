     Wrexham battle Sheffield United to wild, goal-filled draw in FA Cup; match to be replayed in February

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Wrexham AFC are still with a shot of becoming just the sixth non-league team to reach the FA Cup fifth round after a dramatic 3-3 draw with Sheffield United at the Racecourse Ground on Sunday.
The game will not be replayed as such despite the use of the term "replay."
There is no third game as an even score will be decided beyond 90 minutes in that second fixture.
However, they held their own over 90 minutes against Sheffield United and did well to come back from a deflating opening goal against them inside of the opening two minutes by Oliver McBurnie.
Sheffield United had other ideas, though, and broke Wrexham hearts five minutes into added time when John Egan equalized for the 10 men to earn a replay at Bramall Lane.
