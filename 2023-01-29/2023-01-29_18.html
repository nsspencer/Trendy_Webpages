     Dallas Prepares for Upcoming Winter Weather – NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Because of the winter weather we’re having now, got to get prepared, got to have water, a lot of canned food and of course, toiletries," said Cynthia Castillo who was out shopping with her family.
"Once everybody starts feeling the weather, they’re going to start running into the stores, you’re not going to find anything at all," said Castillo.
The Office of Homeless Solutions has activated Temporary Inclement Weather Shelters due to these conditions.
He said they have room for 360 people, food for each night, cots set up, medical services and space for pets.
A Winter Storm Watch has been issued for North Texas, including Dallas and Fort Worth, from noon on Monday until 9 a.m. on Wednesday.
