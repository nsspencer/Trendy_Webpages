     Summary: With the Philadelphia Eagles winning the NFC Championship and the Kansas City Chiefs taking the AFC title we are assured of a clash between a superior version of Mario and Luigi in Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce.
Yep, Super Bowl LVII is going to be the Kelce Bros. Bowl.
The Kelce Bros. may moonlight as podcast hosts but they are also both very good football players who both already have a Super Bowl title each ... which surely makes for fun conversations at the family dinner, headed by Momma Kelce of course.
There have been some smaller circumstances where this occurred before, however, and we all remember the Harbaugh Bowl where head coach brothers John and Jim faced off in New Orleans for Super Bowl XLVII.
Bring on the Kelce Bowl.
