     Eagles fan goads Joey Bosa into shouting match before 49ers game
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Somehow, Joey Bosa didn’t get the memo about Philadelphians.
Bosa, a Chargers linebacker and the older brother of 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa, was seen getting into it with an obnoxious Eagles fan in South Philly ahead of Sunday’s NFC title game.
The man began filming Joey Bosa and shouting his name while Bosa, wearing a Niners jacket, was waiting in line to get into the game.
Because I’m f—king rich, you f—king broke bitch,” Bosa yelled, in full game mode simply to spectate.
A very uncomfortable-seeming woman in 49ers gear shot a tight-lipped smile to the crowd and ushered Bosa into the stadium.
