     Georgia Bulldogs QB Stetson Bennett arrested in Texas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: articleThe Georgia Bulldogs' two-time national champion quarterback, Stetson Bennett, was arrested for public intoxication in Texas, FOX 4 Dallas confirmed.
Police reportedly arrested him at around 6 a.m. on Sunday on Tribeca Way in Dallas.
After winning back-to-back National Championships for the Bulldogs, Bennett looked forward to a shot in the NFL.
Before the arrest, it was unclear how early he'd be drafted, despite his standout collegiate career that began as a walk-on for Georgia.
Bennett, a native of Blackshear, was selected as the winner of the 2022 Manning Award given annually to the top quarterback in college football.
