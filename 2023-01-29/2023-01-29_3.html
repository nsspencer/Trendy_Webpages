     The Last of Us episode 3 is the ‘San Junipero’ of zombie stories
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: No, “San Junipero” doesn’t have anything to do with zombies, and “Long, Long Time” doesn’t have anything to do with uploading your personality to an endless 1980s club scene.
Back in 2016, everyone I knew was watching “San Junipero,” talking about how they hadn’t watched “San Junipero” yet, or telling me I should watch “San Junipero,” the fourth episode of the third season of Black Mirror.
Eventually, I watched “San Junipero.” It was lovely!
Did you enjoy what “San Junipero” did for bisexual and lesbian sci-fi fans?
note: The rest of this piece contains broad spoilers for “Long, Long Time.”]Also Joel and Ellie are there too, I guess, but whatever.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I was thinking about what happened and nobody made you go along with this plan,” Ellie tells Joel.
Frank tells him that the quarantine zone is completely gone, and Bill lets him out of a hole after testing to see if he’s infected.
Begrudgingly, Bill lets him inside and offers a shower, a new set of clothes, and a home-cooked meal.
“I was never afraid before you showed up,” Bill tells Frank.
Even though, you know, the town Bill made kept two people safe for nearly two decades.

     'The Last of Us' Episode 3 Brings Bill on an Emotional Odyssey

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Bill the survivorA flashback reveals how Bill managed to avoid getting dragged into a quarantine zone by the US military after the September 2003 outbreak.
Tess and Frank immediately hit it off, while the more severe Joel and Bill find a mutual respect.
In 2010, raiders assault the town -- something Joel warned Bill would happen.
HBOUltimately, Ellie and Joel arrive at the house and discover a note from Bill explaining what happened ("To whomever, but probably Joel").
Prior to reaching Bill's town, you can find a smuggler's note about Frank.

     A Standout Episode of The Last of Us Does Something the Games Couldn’t
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And yet to me, a fan of the games, it still felt like a faithful adaptation of what made the games so good.
At one point, when you’re playing as Joel, Ellie is struggling emotionally.
The Last of Us’ third episode, “Long Long Time,” is seemingly self-contained.
At the end of the episode, Joel and Ellie stumble into Bill and Frank’s house long after the lovers have died.
And, for Joel, Bill assumes it’s Joel’s partner, Tess, not knowing that she died at the end of the previous episode.

     The Last of Us Recap: This Is You
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As they make their way to Frank and Bill’s, Joel responds to Ellie’s question about whether or not they’re nice.
It’s also home to a broken Mortal Kombat II machine, a game Ellie knows well even though she’s almost certainly never played it.
“This is you,” Frank says before he begins butchering “Long, Long Time,” the song that gives the episode its title.
25 on the Billboard Hot 100, “Long, Long Time” comes from Ronstadt’s second solo album, 1970’s Silk Purse.
