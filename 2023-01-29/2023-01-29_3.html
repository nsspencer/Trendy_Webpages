     Christian McCaffrey runs in 23-yard touchdown, 49ers and Eagles tied 7-7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesWith Josh Johnson in at quarterback, the 49ers are likely going to have to heavily rely on Christian McCaffrey if they’re going to win Sunday’s NFC Championship Game.
That worked for at least one drive in the second quarter, as McCaffrey punched in a 23-yard touchdown to tie the Eagles at 7-7 with 8:29 left in the first half.
On a six-play drive, McCaffrey had four touches, with the last being the most impressive.
McCaffrey broke multiple tackles and bounced off defenders, keeping his balance before finding open field for the long scoring run.
Purdy has been shown on the sideline with a wrap on his right elbow.

     Christian McCaffrey reminds Deebo Samuel of himself, 49ers star shares
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The duo of Deebo Samuel and Christian McCaffrey has been effective, to say the least, since the latter arrived in the Bay Area in late October.
"It kind of reminds me of last year how I could go from receiver to running back to receiver," Samuel told Irvin.
Ever since McCaffrey was traded from the Carolina Panthers to San Francisco, Samuel has effused the running back's praises, especially with how McCaffrey has stepped up in crucial moments for the 49ers.
With the dynamic duo of Samuel and McCaffrey, the 49ers rattled off 10 straight wins to conclude the 2022 NFL regular season.
Considering how effective the combination of Samuel and McCaffrey has been, it stands to reason that Shanahan will continue using both players as dual threats.

     Summary: In the unlikely season for the San Francisco 49ers, this has to be one of the most unlikely stories in NFL history.
On came journeyman Josh Johnson, who has been on 13 or so teams in a whirlwind career.
Johnson knew what to do: give the ball to Christian McCaffrey.
McCaffrey accounted for 44 of the 46 yards on the 6-play drive that ended with his touchdown.
The Robbie Gould PAT tied the game at 7 in the second quarter.

😱pic.twitter.com/oO8MiAfk2T — ClutchPoints (@ClutchPointsApp) January 29, 2023This is Christian McCaffrey’s ninth straight game with a touchdown.
The 49ers gave up a controversial touchdown on the Eagles’ opening drive and then lost Purdy to his injury.
But instead of going down by two scores, San Francisco’s defense held on multiple occasions before McCaffrey tied the game up with his touchdown.

     Summary: In the NFL Championship Game against the Philadelphia Eagles, the San Francisco 49ers are down to their fourth-string quarterback.
But they still have a lot of talent around the quarterback position, including running back Christian McCaffrey.
With rookie QB Brock Purdy sidelined with an elbow injury, the 49ers turned to journeyman backup Josh Johnson to take the snaps.
Facing a 7-0 deficit, San Francisco managed to tie the game, thanks in massive part to the talented McCaffrey.
The back runs through that tackle attempt as well, on his way to the end zone.
