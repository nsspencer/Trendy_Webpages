     Summary: Against the Miami Heat in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the Boston Celtics could have ... [+] survived either a bad start or a phenomenal game from Jimmy Butler, but not both.
(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images) Getty ImagesThe Boston Celtics haven’t been to the NBA Finals since 2010 when they lost to Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers in seven games.
Considering that they have been to the Eastern Conference Finals six times since then, it’s understandable if they thought that they were overdue.
On Friday night, they had a golden opportunity to punch their ticket by defeating the Miami Heat but bad habits and a historic game from Jimmy Butler ensured that there would be a Game 7.

     Summary: On Friday night, Butler reprised the role.
While Butler led the way, another key factor in the Heat's season-saving win is that they finally made some shots.
And while Jimmy Butler's effort and the Heat's shot-making shouldn't be discounted, it once again feels like the Celtics let a win slip through their fingers.
The bad news is to make it 6-0 they'll have to win a Game 7 on the road, which is not an easy proposition.
