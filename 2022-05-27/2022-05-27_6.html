     Jennifer Aniston Joked About Ending Friends With Therapy &amp; Divorce
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That would be one Jennifer Aniston, who gave the talk show host some advice about ending a long-running TV show.
So just how did Aniston cope with the ending of Friends in 2004?
“Well, you know, I got a divorce and went into therapy,” she said, referencing her split from Brad Pitt the following year.
Aniston confirmed their friendship once again in 2021, telling Howard Stern that she and Pitt are “buddies,” and that “we speak, and there’s no oddness at all.”Of course, getting here took some time — and surely, as Aniston mentioned, therapy.
“It just took me by surprise because it was like, ‘Hi, past, remember me?

     Jennifer Aniston Started Therapy and a “New Chapter” After Divorce from Brad Pitt and Friends Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aniston stopped by the series finale of The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Thursday where she discussed both the end of her marriage to Brad Pitt and the finale of Friends occurring back-to-back.
When asked how she dealt with the hugely successful 10-season who coming to an end, she told DeGeneres with a laugh, “Well, I got a divorce and went into therapy.
It worked great.”After almost five years of marriage, Aniston and Pitt announced they were separating in January 2005, finalizing their divorce in October of that year.
To stay in a marriage based on fear feels like you're doing your one life a disservice.
When the work has been put in and it doesn't seem that there's an option of it working, that's okay.
