    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Friday night, Butler reprised the role.
While Butler led the way, another key factor in the Heat's season-saving win is that they finally made some shots.
And while Jimmy Butler's effort and the Heat's shot-making shouldn't be discounted, it once again feels like the Celtics let a win slip through their fingers.
The bad news is to make it 6-0 they'll have to win a Game 7 on the road, which is not an easy proposition.
He finished with 22 points, three rebounds, five assists and three steals off the bench in by far his best outing of the playoffs.
