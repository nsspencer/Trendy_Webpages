    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Editorial Advisory BoardAmerican flags, church services, parades and poppies in May mean Memorial Day is upon us.
Memorial Day is more than just a day off and the unofficial start of summer.
There are plenty of memorials across the U.S. that honor those that gave their lives to protect our rights.
First celebrated in the late 1800s by many states, Memorial Day was formally established by Congress in 1971 to be observed on the last Monday in May, but the sentiment has never changed.
It’s a day of remembrance and a day of patriotism — a day of gratitude.

     Summary: SAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) - Hidden amongst the crowds of people sure to flock to the Hostess City this Memorial Day Weekend stand a couple reminders of what it’s all about.
Remembering the fallen who sacrificed for these freedoms,” said Vietnam Veteran Robert Young.
For Young the Vietnam Veterans Memorial off Bay Street takes him back to his time serving his country.
The weight of that sacrifice not lost on fellow veteran Doug Cox.
“I just saw two Greene’s on the wall there.”A wall full of those who laid down their lives.

     Weekly GOP Radio Address: Sen. Ballweg says many Americans have forgotten the meaning and traditions of Memorial Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Memorial Day was originally founded as America was breathing the last gasps of the Civil War.
As the death toll reached a jarring number of over 600,000 people, mothers and families grieved the loss of their loved ones.
This informal tradition, known as Decorating Day, became the federal holiday we now know as Memorial Day.
It’s no secret that the traditional observance of Memorial Day has diminished over the years.
Many Americans have forgotten the meaning and traditions, and instead treat this day of remembrance as a long weekend or the kick-off to summer.

     The Meaning of Memorial Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I was born on Memorial Day, but it would take me 25 years to fully comprehend why this federal holiday exists.
By the time my only brother, Nicholas Oresti Cherava, enlisted, my father had passed, but his commitment to sacrifice, selflessness and camaraderie still echoed.
Memorial Day has always been significant to my family as a time to honor the fallen and to remember everyone who has passed in our lives.
NPCA at Work Working with Veterans to Protect National Parks NPCA’s veterans program meaningfully engages the military community — including veterans, active duty, reservists and military families — to support national parks through service projects and advocacy.
Before moving to Colorado at the end of 2011, I would return to the Marine Corps Memorial every October 6 with flowers and a penny in memory of Nicholas.
