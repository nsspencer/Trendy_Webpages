     Warrriors' NBA Finals hat looks like a gas station purchase, and it is so bad it actually rocks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Golden State Warriors won the Western Conference Finals on Thursday, beating the Dallas Mavericks in a 4-1 series, and with the victory, they were handed some interesting celebratory hats.
If I were designing merch for the NBA Finals, I’ll admit, it probably would not look anything like what Golden State wore on Thursday night.
Take a look at Golden State’s Juan Toscano-Anderson, who is originally from Oakland and will soon make his first trip to the NBA Finals as a player:Next stop: 2022 NBA Finals pic.twitter.com/yeBMDRlEOs — Golden State Warriors (@warriors) May 27, 2022From what you can see in the video above, the hat has a throwback vibe.
But I’m leaning towards putting them in the “it’s so bad it’s good” category of fun.
Here were some reactions to the merch, with comparisons to a gas station find and more:

3 Western Conference)Won NBA Western Conference First Round (4-1) vs. Denver Nuggets Won NBA Western Conference Semifinals (4-2) vs. Memphis Grizzlies Winning NBA Western Conference Finals (4-1) vs. Dallas MavericksThe shorthanded Nuggets were no match for the Warriors' small-ball "Death lineup."

     The Warriors’ return to the NBA finals is a remarkable feat of regeneration
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With their 120-110 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night, the Golden State Warriors clinched the Western Conference championship and booked a sixth NBA finals appearance in the last eight years.
The story of the Warriors’ 2022 finals run has not been one of a simple continuation of previous success.
Golden State began this season with the clear intent to end their two-year playoff drought.
The Warriors’ return to the summit was not accomplished off the backs of their veteran stars Curry and Green alone, though.
Gary Payton II, the son of a former Defensive Player of the Year, had experienced a nomadic career before signing with Golden State last year.

     What the Golden State Warriors Have to Fear
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After dispensing with the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night, the Golden State Warriors are now headed for their sixth NBA Finals in the past eight years.
AdvertisementIt’s probably hard for the kids out there to believe, but there once was a time when the Golden State Warriors were bad.
In 2015, the core of Curry, Thompson, and Green helped lead Golden State to their first NBA title in 40 years.
In 2020, Golden State drafted center James Wiseman with the second overall pick in the draft, but he has battled injury issues throughout his first two years in the league and has thus far played only 39 games.
The future appears bright in Golden State, but it’s nothing like the present, and no amount of foresight can stop the fact that the greatest NBA teams are always unique and finite occurrences.

     Summary: (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) ASSOCIATED PRESSJust when you think it’s over, the Golden State Warriors force everyone to recalibrate.
After two seasons hampered by injuries, the Dubs have reached their sixth NBA Finals in the last eight years.
The combination of the two is what solidifies Golden State on the Mount Rushmore of NBA dynasties.
So, it’s not that Golden State has just capitalized on being a top seed for most of this journey.
Three years ago, after losing in the Finals, Green warned everyone that Golden State would eventually return to their throne as West powerhouses.

"You can't run a marathon every single year or keep running them back-to-back without some price to pay," Myers told FOX Sports.
Without that break, the Warriors wouldn't be where they are now: back in the NBA Finals for the sixth time in eight seasons.
"Everybody has a different idea of why it stopped, whether injuries or Kevin left," Myers told FOX Sports.
"I didn't know that we'd be any good …" Myers told FOX Sports.
