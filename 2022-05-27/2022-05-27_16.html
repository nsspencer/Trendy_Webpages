     Gabe Kapler won't come out for anthem until direction of country changes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In light of Tuesday’s elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas that killed 19 kids and two teachers, Giants manager Gabe Kapler said he will not come out on the field of play and stand for the national anthem.
“I don’t plan on coming out for the anthem going forward until I feel better about the direction of our country,” Kapler told reporters Friday in Cincinnati before the Giants began a three-game series with the Reds at Great American Ballpark.
I didn’t want to take away from the victims or their families,” Kapler wrote.
Kapler told reporters Friday that he needed some time to think through how he wanted to act and wasn’t in the right frame of mind to do so earlier in the week.
“Sometimes for me it takes me a couple of days to put everything together,” Kapler said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Giants manager Gabe Kapler does not plan on taking the field for the national anthem going forward in response to the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, he said Friday.
"I’m often struck before our games by the lack of delivery of the promise of what our national anthem represents," he wrote.
He added that his "brain said drop to a knee" during the anthem Wednesday, but that his "body didn’t listen."
Kapler previously knelt for the anthem during the 2020 season but decided not to do so anymore ahead of the 2021 campaign.
Asked whether he's communicated his plans with the team, Kapler said he's articulated his thoughts to players on an individual basis.

     Giants Manager Gabe Kapler Pens Message in Wake of Uvalde Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In response to the mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler wrote an essay titled “Home of the Brave?” expressing his concern with the state of the country’s gun violence.
He explains how he considered kneeling out of protest, but his body ultimately wouldn’t let him.
The home of the brave should encourage this.”The incident happened on Tuesday, when a reported 18-year-old gunman killed 19 children and two adults in Robb Elementary School in Uvalde.
Kapler published the essay on Kaplerstyle.com, a website that he occasionally uses to publicize his thoughts on certain issues.
Last year, he wrote an essay titled “Sports Are Everyone,” which touched on the lack of inclusivity in sports.

He will not be coming out of the clubhouse or dugout onto the field for the playing of the national anthem for the time being.

"We elect our politicians to represent our interests," Kapler wrote.
"I’m often struck before our games by the lack of delivery of the promise of what our national anthem represents," Kapler wrote.

     Giants’ Gabe Kapler to skip national anthem over political inactivity on gun control
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CINCINNATI — San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler said Friday he will remain in the clubhouse during the national anthem at ballgames, a protest against the nation’s lack of action following the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.
“I don’t plan on coming out for the anthem going forward until I feel better about the direction of our country,” Kapler said in the Giants’ dugout before their series opener.
Asked where he’ll be during the playing of the anthem, Kapler said, “Wherever my job takes me, just not on the field.
“I make allowances for any views, and keeping my side of the street clean is really about expressing myself,” Kapler said.
“What happens from there, I really don't have much control over.”Of course, Kapler isn’t the first Bay Area leader of a professional sports team to speak out against gun violence.
