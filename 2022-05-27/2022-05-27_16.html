     Jennifer Aniston Started Therapy and a “New Chapter” After Divorce from Brad Pitt and Friends Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Aniston stopped by the series finale of The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Thursday where she discussed both the end of her marriage to Brad Pitt and the finale of Friends occurring back-to-back.
When asked how she dealt with the hugely successful 10-season who coming to an end, she told DeGeneres with a laugh, “Well, I got a divorce and went into therapy.
It worked great.”After almost five years of marriage, Aniston and Pitt announced they were separating in January 2005, finalizing their divorce in October of that year.
To stay in a marriage based on fear feels like you're doing your one life a disservice.
When the work has been put in and it doesn't seem that there's an option of it working, that's okay.
