     Summary: Peter Arredondo, the chief of police for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, stopped at least 19 officers from breaking into the school as the gunman opened fire for at least an hour.
After working as the police captain at the United Independent School District in Laredo, Texas, about 140 miles south of Uvalde, Arredondo returned to his hometown in April 2020, when he accepted the position of chief of police for the Uvalde school district, according to the Uvalde Leader-News.
“We want to make sure we are available wherever we are needed,” Arredondo told the newspaper.
I have plenty of ideas, and I definitely have plenty of drive,” Arredondo told the outlet this month.
Arredondo is scheduled to be sworn onto the council on Tuesday, exactly one week after the Uvalde shooting.

     Summary: Police are facing heavy criticism and being labeled "cowards" for their response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, this week.
"The Uvalde police were a bunch of gutless cowards who shamed their badges," British TV personality Piers Morgan tweeted on Friday.
Republicans, Democrats, Independents and I think everyone agrees that the Uvalde police are cowards, liars and should be in prison themselves.
I am just going to say it: the Uvalde local police are cowards and failed to protect these children.
The Uvalde Police Department's Facebook page was overwhelmed with thousands of angry comments from the public following the shooting.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first officers on the scene were from the Uvalde city police force, which has a part-time SWAT team and about 40 officers on the payroll.
Officers waited nearly an hour inside Robb Elementary School before a group stormed into the classroom and confronted 18-year-old Salvador Rolando Ramos.
In March, the school district police hosted active shooter training at Uvalde High School, according to a post on the agency’s Facebook page.
The Texas legislature in 2019 approved a measure that required such training for all school police officers.
It notes that an armed school resource officer remained outside the Parkland high school rather than confronting the gunman, bringing criticism upon himself and his department.
