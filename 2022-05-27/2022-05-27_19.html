     Travis Kelce on being underpaid: Money is secondary, I’m here for the legacy and the team
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesOn #PFTPM last week, 49ers tight end George Kittle said Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is so underpaid it “boggles my mind.” But Kelce says he’s not concerned about it.
Instead, Kelce says that his primary concern is winning games and continuing to build on his status as one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history.
“That’s my guy and he always wants to see every tight end get paid as much as their production is.
I’m here for the legacy and I’m here to try and make the Kansas City Chiefs the best team possible.
That’s why I’m here.”The 32-year-old Kelce has four years left on a contract that pays him an average of just under $15 million a year.

     Travis Kelce Reacts To George Kittle Saying He's Underpaid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last week, 49ers tight end George Kittle said Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is so underpaid it "boggles his mind."
“I mean Travis Kelce, six seasons in a row, 1000 yards,” Kittle said, via ProFootballTalk.
“I’m pretty sure he has the most receiving yards over any wide receiver, skill position in the last six years.
I mean, to me, Travis Kelce, he’s been doing it for so long and at such a high level.

     Chiefs’ Travis Kelce focusing on team, considers money ‘secondary’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s somewhat easier to understand when you consider Kelce inked a four-year, $57 million extension with the Chiefs just prior to the 2020 season.
Still, the three-time first team All-Pro tight end is considered underpaid by many of his peers, including San Francisco’s George Kittle.
That’s my guy and he always wants to see every tight end get paid as much as their production is."
He has 57 receiving touchdowns and a handful of NFL records, one of which is the most 1,000-yard receiving seasons by a tight end (6).
"I’m here for the legacy and I’m here to try and make the Kansas City Chiefs the best team possible," Kelce added, per PFT.

     Travis Kelce talks about whether or not he’s underpaid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Travis Kelce is one of the best tight ends in the NFL.
For instance, San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle had a strong reaction to Kelce’s contract status saying it “boggles my mind” that Kelce is making that much in comparison to the top wide receivers making double that.
Kelce was asked about Kittle’s comments and while he’s appreciative of Kittle’s perspective of the situation, he had his reasons to make what he makes.
I’m here for the legacy and I’m here to try and make the Kansas City Chiefs the best team possible.
On the other hand, Kittle’s point is that Kelce deciding not to go for top dollar can affect more people than just Kelce.

     How long can Travis Kelce remain NFL’s greatest tight end?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Entering his tenth season with the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce has proven to be one of the greatest tight ends of all time.
Once upon a time, the Kansas City Chiefs had one tight end named Travis Kelce and another tight end named… well they didn’t really ever have another tight end.
On top of six straight 1,000-yard seasons, he’s also set the single-season yards record for a tight end twice over the last couple years.
Kelce and Gronk are actually the same age, but Kelce entered the league almost 3 years after Gronk did, and then missed his rookie season.
Tony Gonzalez, another great Chief tight end, laid the foundation for what it means to have an extraordinarily long career for a tight end.

     Travis Kelce responds to George Kittle: ‘Money is secondary’

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: — Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is appreciative of his fellow tight end in San Francisco, George Kittle, saying he deserves to be paid more, but Kelce said his mind is on more than just money.
“I appreciate Kittle saying that because that’s my guy and he always wants to see every tight end get paid as much as their production is,” Kelce said.
Kelce has 7,269 receiving yards over the last six seasons.
TE Travis Kelce – 7,269 WR Davante Adams – 7,192 WR Julio Jones – 7,129 WR DeAndre Hopkins – 7,0408 WR Mike Evans – 7,044Even though the stats back up Kittle’s assertion, Kelce has more than just big money on his mind.
He is the first tight end in NFL history with six consecutive 1,000-plus receiving yard seasons and trails only another legendary Chiefs tight end, Tony Gonzalez, in the franchise all-time receiving yards and touchdown rankings.
