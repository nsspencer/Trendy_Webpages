     Controversial overturned goal helps Edmonton Oilers eliminate Calgary Flames in Game Five
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Edmonton Oilers are moving on to the Western Conference Final but they aren’t doing so without some controversy.
Late in the third period of Game Five, it looked like the Calgary Flames had taken the lead through a Blake Coleman skate redirection.
The play then went under review and apparently, enough evidence was found to overturn the goal.
While being checked from behind and in the middle of falling, Coleman guides the puck over the redline with his skate.

     Summary: The energy and vibe around the city has been amazing.”For the Oilers, everything clicked when it needed to.
And while Mikael Backlund gracefully tipped a puck into the top corner 5:41 in, this game didn’t feel out of reach.
Hyman’s tally kicked off a record-setting 1:11 that saw four goals scored, the fastest time in which that happened in playoff history.
Or that Zach Hyman scored as many goals in the series as Matthew Tkachuk, Elias Lindholm and Johnny Gaudreau combined.
Colorado, meanwhile, is a team the Oilers match up well against.
