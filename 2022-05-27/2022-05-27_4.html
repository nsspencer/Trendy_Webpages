This means it’s not exactly impossible that Disney could develop its own series fully based on the iconic Darth Vader.
It also features the return of fellow Star War alums Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader and Joel Edgerton as Owen Lars.

     Hayden Christensen wonders if Qui-Gon could have saved Anakin
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Obi-Wan Kenobi star Hayden Christensen believes Qui-Gon Jinn might have been able to save Anakin Skywalker from his fate.
In an interview with ComicBook, Christensen shared his thoughts on Qui-Gon, and why these questions are what makes Star Wars so interesting.
In The Phantom Menace, Qui-Gon dies in battle against Sith Lord Darth Maul, leaving Obi-Wan to step in.
Their division culminates in a battle on Mustafar in Revenge of the Sith, which is the last time they meet before Obi-Wan Kenobi picks up.
The first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi are streaming on Disney Plus.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hayden Christensen, who returns to the world of Star Wars in the new series Obi-Wan Kenobi on Disney Plus, has revealed he would be interested in leading a Darth Vader spinoff.
Obi-Wan Kenobi has only just premiered on Disney Plus, welcoming both Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor back into a galaxy far, far away.
While both Ewan McGregor and Kathleen Kennedy have expressed an interest in telling more Obi-Wan stories, there are perhaps more opportunities for galaxy-spanning adventures with Christensen’s Darth Vader.

     Hayden Christensen Didn't Talk To George Lucas Before Joining Obi-Wan Kenobi
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Hayden Christensen recently revealed that he had not talked to Star Wars creator George Lucas before joining Obi-Wan Kenobi.
It follows the titular Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) as he lives in exile on the desert planet Tatooine and watches over a young Luke Skywalker from afar.
The reaction is a far cry from the mixed reception his performances received in both Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.
As the actor explained, Christensen simply chose to maintain a singular vision with the story and looked to Chow as a creative guide for his Obi-Wan Kenobi role.
