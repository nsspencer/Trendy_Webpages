     Summary: The other day, Harrison Ford made an unexpected appearance to talk about Indiana Jones 5, which is officially coming out next year.
A wonderful, wonderful talent that we’re blessed with.
Well, I guess there’s some similarity between Indiana Jones plumbing the depths of forgotten caves and doctors performing a colonoscopy.
Harrison Ford is “really proud” of Indiana Jones 5Talking more generally about the next Indiana Jones movie, Ford said that he’s “really proud of the movie that we made.” For a guy known to be kind of grumpy, Ford was in a good mood.
Although original Indiana Jones director Steven Spielberg was originally going to direct the sequel, he had to back out.
