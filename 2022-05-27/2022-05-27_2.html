It is set nine years before the events of Star Wars: A New Hope.
Now, in the series, we see a younger version of the Jedi Master played by Ewan McGregor.
And now I’m closer to him in age — I didn’t realize he was 63 when he made [Star Wars] … I’m getting closer to that age now (laughs).
He said, “I don’t try and do an impersonation of him, but I do try and make it sound familiar, like the way he speaks and the rhythm of his delivery.”Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi is coming out soonThe first episode of the upcoming series, Obi-Wan Kenobi, is coming out tomorrow, May 27.

     'Obi-Wan Kenobi' star Ewan McGregor says it was 'easier' to watch 'Star Wars' sequels because he wasn't in them
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Obi-Wan Kenobi" star Ewan McGregor said that the "Star Wars" sequel movies were "easier" to watch.
McGregor starred in the "Star Wars" prequel trilogy in the 2000s, which were panned by critics.
"I continued to love the 'Star Wars' universe and as the sequels were being made, I was happy," the actor said.
The movies also had appearances from actors from the original "Star Wars" trilogy, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher.
"Obi-Wan Kenobi" is the third live-action Disney+ series created for the "Star Wars" universe and six more new series are on their way.

     Ewan McGregor Says This Version of ‘Obi-Wan Kenobi’ Is ‘Different’ Than What Fans Have Seen Before
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Of all the long-awaited spin-offs in the Star Wars universe, few hold a candle to Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Now, nearly 20 years after Revenge of the Sith, fans will get their wish, as the six-part Disney+ series—aptly named Obi-Wan Kenobi—will see actor Ewan McGregor return to the role.
While the series hit a few different speed humps along the way, audiences won’t have to wait much longer to see what exactly it is Obi-Wan got up to in those intervening years.
Obi-Wan is changed, too, as this dark period in Star Wars history sees Obi-Wan without his trademark wit and Errol Flynn-like swashbuckling attitude.
It’s a different side of the character and one McGregor seemed excited to dig into when he sat down for a junket interview with Complex recently.
