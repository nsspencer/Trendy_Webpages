     Controversial overturned goal helps Edmonton Oilers eliminate Calgary Flames in Game Five
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Edmonton Oilers are moving on to the Western Conference Final but they aren’t doing so without some controversy.
Late in the third period of Game Five, it looked like the Calgary Flames had taken the lead through a Blake Coleman skate redirection.
The play then went under review and apparently, enough evidence was found to overturn the goal.
While being checked from behind and in the middle of falling, Coleman guides the puck over the redline with his skate.

     Edmonton Oilers eliminate Calgary Flames in Game 5 to advance to Western Conference finals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Edmonton captain Connor McDavid scored at 5:03 of overtime, bringing the Oilers to victory over the Calgary Flames 5-4 on Thursday night in Game 5 of the second-round playoff series, and advancing them to the Western Conference finals.
Zach Hyman had a goal and two assists and Darnell Nurse, Jesse Puljujarvi and Evan Bouchard each also scored for the Oilers.
Mike Smith made 32 saves, helping Edmonton claim the first postseason Battle of Alberta in 31 years.
The Oilers will face either the Colorado Avalanche or St. Louis Blues in their first conference final appearance since 2006.
Colorado leads that series 3-2, with Game 6 set for Friday in St. Louis.

     The Day After: The Edmonton Oilers are conference finals bound
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The energy and vibe around the city has been amazing.”For the Oilers, everything clicked when it needed to.
And while Mikael Backlund gracefully tipped a puck into the top corner 5:41 in, this game didn’t feel out of reach.
Hyman’s tally kicked off a record-setting 1:11 that saw four goals scored, the fastest time in which that happened in playoff history.
Or that Zach Hyman scored as many goals in the series as Matthew Tkachuk, Elias Lindholm and Johnny Gaudreau combined.
Colorado, meanwhile, is a team the Oilers match up well against.

     Summary: The Oilers will now await the winner of the Colorado Avalanche-St. Louis Blues series, with the Avalanche up 3-2 heading into Game 6 of that series Friday night.
“Everybody wants to win,” McDavid said after joining Esa Tikkanen as the only Oiler to score a series-winning overtime goal against the Flames.
And we’ve had to learn a lot of lessons along the way.”Compared to his earlier games in the series, McDavid had a relatively quiet night at the Scotiabank Saddledome on Thursday.
The teams set a new NHL mark for fastest four goals in a playoff game, sharing two each over a span of just 1:11.
In all, the two teams combined for 45 goals in the five-game series, which was the fifth-highest-scoring five-game series in league history.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This series took us back to the ‘80s, clocking in as the fifth highest scoring five-game series in NHL history.
Five Oilers had that many or more, while Draisaitl had three more points than the entire Flames first line combined.
The team whose stars are the better stars, whose goalie is the better goalie, wins the series every time.
This one was wildly entertaining, but it was a five-game rout where the better team is the one moving on.
We’re not saying he out-coached Sutter, but his team was the better team.
