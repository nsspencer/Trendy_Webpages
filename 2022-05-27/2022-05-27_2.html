A Tornado Watch remains in effect until 6 p.m. for Dorchester, Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties.
For much of Maryland, the threat for severe weather primarily means the potential for heavy downpours, damaging wind gusts, large hail and isolated tornadoes.
As a reminder, a tornado watch means the conditions are ripe for a tornado to form, unlike a tornado warning, which means tornadic activity has been detected.
The Flood Watch is in effect for Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Cecil, Frederick, Harford, Howard, Montgomery and Washington counties.
