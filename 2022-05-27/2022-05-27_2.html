     Controversial overturned goal helps Edmonton Oilers eliminate Calgary Flames in Game Five
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Edmonton Oilers are moving on to the Western Conference Final but they aren’t doing so without some controversy.
Late in the third period of Game Five, it looked like the Calgary Flames had taken the lead through a Blake Coleman skate redirection.
The play then went under review and apparently, enough evidence was found to overturn the goal.
While being checked from behind and in the middle of falling, Coleman guides the puck over the redline with his skate.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Oilers will now await the winner of the Colorado Avalanche-St. Louis Blues series, with the Avalanche up 3-2 heading into Game 6 of that series Friday night.
“Everybody wants to win,” McDavid said after joining Esa Tikkanen as the only Oiler to score a series-winning overtime goal against the Flames.
And we’ve had to learn a lot of lessons along the way.”Compared to his earlier games in the series, McDavid had a relatively quiet night at the Scotiabank Saddledome on Thursday.
The teams set a new NHL mark for fastest four goals in a playoff game, sharing two each over a span of just 1:11.
In all, the two teams combined for 45 goals in the five-game series, which was the fifth-highest-scoring five-game series in league history.

     Edmonton Oilers keen to add another championship chapter to storied franchise
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CALGARY — The Edmonton Oilers have a rich history.
Connor McDavid's overtime goal Thursday clinched the first playoff Battle of Alberta in 31 years as the Oilers defeated the Calgary Flames 5-4 to move onto the Western Conference final.
The franchise made another final in 2006, but lost to the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games before missing the playoffs for 10 straight seasons.
And despite a roster featuring McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, the Oilers had advanced to the second round just once in the star forwards' six previous campaigns until this spring.
"We're proud of the Hall of Fame people that have come through our organization," Oilers interim head coach Jay Woodcroft said after eliminating the Flames.

     Summary: This series took us back to the ‘80s, clocking in as the fifth highest scoring five-game series in NHL history.
Five Oilers had that many or more, while Draisaitl had three more points than the entire Flames first line combined.
The team whose stars are the better stars, whose goalie is the better goalie, wins the series every time.
This one was wildly entertaining, but it was a five-game rout where the better team is the one moving on.
We’re not saying he out-coached Sutter, but his team was the better team.
