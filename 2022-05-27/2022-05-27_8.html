     Summary: Officials call it the 'wrong decision' to delay confronting the Uvalde school shooterEnlarge this image toggle caption Dario Lopez-Mills/AP Dario Lopez-Mills/APCol. Steven McCraw of the Texas Department of Public Safety said at a Friday news conference that in hindsight it was the wrong decision to not enter the classroom in Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman was located for more than an hour.
He said there were "plenty of officers" inside the school from the earliest minutes of the shootout.
The incident commander on the scene, whom McCraw did not name, believed that once gunfire stopped the situation transitioned from an active shooter situation to a "barricaded subject" situation.
McCraw confirmed that the school's officer was not at the school at the time, but rushed to the school when he heard the reports of gunfire.
There were 142 spent rounds found inside the school, McCraw said, along with 173 live rounds.

Police officers, including the school district officer, went into the school minutes later.
During that terrifying time — well over an hour — parents of students who were trapped in the school gathered outside the building as word spread of the shooting.
Some of the parents implored the heavily armed police officers at the chaotic scene to storm the school.
We need precision riflemen, negotiators.”As the officers fell, the gunman continued shooting, said the state police official.

     Summary: “At that point, if they proceeded any further not knowing where the suspect was at, they could’ve been shot, they could’ve been killed, and that gunman would have had an opportunity to kill other people inside that school,” Olivarez said.
"They could've been shot.
They could've been killed," Texas police lieutenant explains why law enforcement did not go into Uvalde school right away.
Olivarez said that was “correct,” explaining some of the uncertainty faced by law enforcement in Uvalde.
“He actually said the cops were reluctant to engage the shooter because, ‘They could’ve been shot.
