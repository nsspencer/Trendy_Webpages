Hayden Christensen returns to ‘Star Wars’ in ‘Obi-Wan Kenobi’Although the Star Wars franchise has a knack for bringing characters back in future projects, Hayden Christensen hasn’t made an appearance in a galaxy far, far away since Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith.
That changes with Obi-Wan Kenobi, which will see him following up on Anakin Skywalker’s dark turn in the prequel movies.

     Hayden Christensen Only Needed 6 Words to Send the Star Wars Celebration Crowd Wild
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It's been no secret that Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen's return to Star Wars has been a popular point for fans, but with just a few words at yesterday's Star Wars Celebration, we saw quite how popular.
During an interview ahead of the premiere of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan) and Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader) were regularly interrupted by an incredibly excited crowd.
Referencing the Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith line (which itself has become a meme), Chistensen simply replied, "This is where the fun begins."
And the room went absolutely wild – as you can see in the tweet below:Hayden Christensen wanted to make sure the fans at Star Wars Celebration knew one thing.
Obi-Wan's first two episodes premiered last night (among many other Star Wars announcements) and they aim to fill a gap in time between episodes 3 and 4 of Star Wars, showing new parts of the relationship between the two actors' characters.

     Summary: Star Wars Celebration 2022 has essentially been built around two pieces of franchise lore: the brand new Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year.
Okay — we all guessed right, but Star Wars Celebration made us wait for it.
McGregor and Christensen didn’t take the stage until 3/4ths of the way through the hourlong panel, but the crowd definitely did not mind.
“Ewan was so gracious with me, he took me under his wing,” said Christensen, who’s reunited with McGregor for Obi-Wan Kenobi.
When Lucas would see the golden droid walk on set, Daniels would often hear George say, “Now Star Wars has arrived.”
