On Budden’s Patreon, Rashad told the host he identifies as “sexually fluid,” responding to the video of him with other men.

“I’m putting my head in the books to find out the basics of it, but basically, like, I’m not in full control of, when I walk into a room, of who I’m attracted to.” He further said he is currently in a monogamous relationship with his girlfriend, “who has a similar understanding of themselves in that way.” Rashad previously addressed the leaked video during his Coachella set, which opened with a montage of supportive clips from the days after the leak.
