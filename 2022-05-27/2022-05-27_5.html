     As Biden administration leans toward $10,000 in student loan forgiveness, advocates push back
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Student loan borrowers gather near The White House to tell President Biden to cancel student debt - all of it with no means-testing on May 12, 2020 in Washington, DC.
Advocates expressed anger and disappointment on Friday in response to news that the Biden administration is leaning toward forgiving $10,000 in student loans per borrower.
Some Democrats and activists have insisted that President Joe Biden needs to cancel at least $50,000 per borrower to make a meaningful impact on the country's $1.7 trillion outstanding student loan balance.

The Washington Post on Friday matched prior reporting that the $10,000 plan is the Biden administration's leading student debt cancellation plan in the final days of May.

     White House says no decision made on student loan forgiveness

     Summary: U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House in Washington, U.S. May 24, 2022.
REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueWASHINGTON, May 27 (Reuters) - The administration of President Joe Biden has not made a final decision on student loan cancellation, a White House spokesperson said on Friday, after a news report said it was planning to cancel $10,000 in student debt per borrower.
Not to mention tens of billions more saved by the 41 million borrowers who have benefited from the extended student loan payment pause," Patel said.
Student debt cancellation has become a priority for many liberals and one that could shore up popularity with younger and more highly educated voters, who lean Democratic, before November's midterm congressional elections.
The federal government has let 43 million borrowers stop paying on a total of $1.6 trillion in student loans since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

     Student loans: Report says latest plan would forgive $10,000 in student debt
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reports: Latest plan would forgive $10,000 in student debt According to news outlets, the order to cancel student loan debt is drafted but has not been signed yet as Biden is still deciding to proceed.
The Student Loan Accountability Act would prohibit the Education, Justice, and Treasury Departments from taking any action that would forgive student-loan borrowers’ debt.
“It makes no sense for the Biden Administration to cancel nearly $2 trillion in student loan debt,” Romney said in a statement.
He has pledged to consider some debt relief, but has said he will not consider canceling $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower as some in his party are urging him to do.
Biden has already canceled $18.5 billion of student loans for 750,000 student loan borrowers.

     Biden zeroes in on plan to cancel $10,000 in student loans per borrower
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (The Hill) – President Biden is nearing a decision on student loan debt forgiveness, with the president and his team zeroing in on canceling $10,000 per borrower, with some potential caveats.
It is also unclear if the cancelation would apply to all student loan debt, or just undergraduate students.
Biden in the 2020 campaign supported forgiving at least $10,000 in federal student loans per person after several other candidates made student loan forgiveness a key part of their platforms.
While that large of a sum has been publicly ruled out, Biden has in recent weeks made increasingly clear he is prepared to provide some student debt forgiveness.
Biden last month extended the pandemic moratorium on federal student loan payments and interest accrual through August.

     Summary: The White House said no final determination has been made about the matter.
Biden said he would come to a decision on student debt in the “next couple of weeks” on April 28, nearly a month ago.
Advertisement“No decisions have been made yet,” Vedant Petal, a White House spokesman, said in a statement Thursday.
Relying on tax data could also exclude millions of lower-income Americans who do not file taxes but do owe student loans.
Defaults and delinquencies on student loans were concentrated among borrowers with less than $10,000 in debt before the pause of federal student loan payments, according to the Federal Reserve.

     White House Denies Report Of $10,000 Of Student Loan Forgiveness: “No Decisions Have Been Made Yet”

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Biden could cancel student loans tomorrowWill Biden cancel student loan debt tomorrow?
While the White House says Biden hasn’t decided on wide-scale student loan forgiveness, the president could use tomorrow’s graduation as an opportunity to announce his intentions on student loan relief.
If Biden cancels $50,000 of student loan debt, it would eliminate federal student loan debt for 36 million student loan borrowers.
The next major deadline for student loan borrowers is the end of temporary student loan relief on August 31, 2022.
Regardless of Biden’s announcement on student loan forgiveness, pay close attention to the end of the student loan payment pause.

     Biden nears decision on student loans as inflation worries mount
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CNN —Top White House aides have drafted the order for canceling some student loan debt, but they’re still waiting for President Joe Biden to make up his mind on whether to go forward with it.
Close as Biden seems to making an announcement, the conversations have still been caught up, in part, by the basics.
Jones, Warren and others have repeatedly pointed out to the White House that Biden used his authority to defer payments and no Republicans sued over that.
Inflation looms over the decisionOther leaders on the Hill have been trying to calibrate pressure on the White House.
It’s not that there are likely many single-issue student debt voters, said the firm’s political director, Marcela Mulholland.
