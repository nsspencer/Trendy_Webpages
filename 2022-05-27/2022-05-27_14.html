     Gervonta Davis-Rolando Romero Preview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gervonta Davis is unquestionably one of the more interesting and talented fighters in the current boxing scene.
“I feel as though it’s my career,” Davis recently told Showtime’s Brian Custer, “so I feel as though I need to be the one to control my career.
First, though, Davis has to get by the outspoken Romero, who has had a notable (to put it mildly) several months himself.
The fight with Davis was supposed to occur last December, but sexual assault charges against Romero derailed the match for obvious reasons.
Those charges were eventually dropped, leading to the Davis fight becoming a reality.

The one fight where Romero was not able to do so came in his August 2020 fight with Jackson Marinez.

     Animosity between Gervonta Davis and Floyd Mayweather is overblown, 2 boxing insiders say
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There is great speculation as to whether he'll re-sign, or leave Floyd Mayweather forever.
The former five-weight world champion boxer Floyd Mayweather has represented the fast-rising 135-pounder "Tank" Davis since 2015.
With the help of Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe, Davis has established himself as one of the premier combat sports attractions in the US.
'It's my career,' Davis saidLeonard Ellerbe pictured alongside Gervonta Davis in 2021.
"But looking at the landscape … it's tough to say there's a group that would do a better job on Gervonta Davis than Mayweather Promotions has done to this point.

     Tank vs talk: Gervonta Davis aims to quiet challenger Romero
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The bout headlines a Showtime pay-per-view card and the first big boxing event back in Brooklyn since the pandemic started more than two years ago.
“There’s definitely different levels when you come to the sport of boxing,” Davis said.
You’ve got somebody that’s been doing this since they were 7 and somebody that’s been doing this since they were 17.
He’ll have to make room — or move out of the way — for Romero if the challenger fights as good as he talks.
Once that’s done, Davis is confident there won’t be anything left for Romero to talk about.
