     Gervonta Davis-Rolando Romero Preview
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gervonta Davis is unquestionably one of the more interesting and talented fighters in the current boxing scene.
“I feel as though it’s my career,” Davis recently told Showtime’s Brian Custer, “so I feel as though I need to be the one to control my career.
First, though, Davis has to get by the outspoken Romero, who has had a notable (to put it mildly) several months himself.
The fight with Davis was supposed to occur last December, but sexual assault charges against Romero derailed the match for obvious reasons.
Those charges were eventually dropped, leading to the Davis fight becoming a reality.

     Watch as Gervonta Davis shoves Rolando Romero off stage after weighing in for Showtime PPV bout
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With all the bad blood between Rolly Romero and Gervonta Davis ahead of their clash Saturday on Showtime pay-per-view, it seemed that things could boil over at the official weigh-ins on Friday afternoon.
It was Davis who made a move after the fighters had stepped off the scales, literally pushing Romero over the edge.
Romero stepped in front of Davis with his own flex and Davis gave Romero a small shove, sending Romero falling off the edge of the stage.
"I just seen him on the edge of the stage so I just pushed him," Davis said when asked about the shove by the Showtime crew.
Davis and Romero are two big punchers with a lot of bad blood between them.

     Tank vs talk: Gervonta Davis aims to quiet challenger Romero
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The bout headlines a Showtime pay-per-view card and the first big boxing event back in Brooklyn since the pandemic started more than two years ago.
“There’s definitely different levels when you come to the sport of boxing,” Davis said.
You’ve got somebody that’s been doing this since they were 7 and somebody that’s been doing this since they were 17.
He’ll have to make room — or move out of the way — for Romero if the challenger fights as good as he talks.
Once that’s done, Davis is confident there won’t be anything left for Romero to talk about.
