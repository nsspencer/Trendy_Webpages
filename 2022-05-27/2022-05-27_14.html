     Uvalde police chief who delayed officer response to shooting to join City Council
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Peter Arredondo, the chief of police for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, stopped at least 19 officers from breaking into the school as the gunman opened fire for at least an hour.
After working as the police captain at the United Independent School District in Laredo, Texas, about 140 miles south of Uvalde, Arredondo returned to his hometown in April 2020, when he accepted the position of chief of police for the Uvalde school district, according to the Uvalde Leader-News.
“We want to make sure we are available wherever we are needed,” Arredondo told the newspaper.
I have plenty of ideas, and I definitely have plenty of drive,” Arredondo told the outlet this month.
Arredondo is scheduled to be sworn onto the council on Tuesday, exactly one week after the Uvalde shooting.

Police officers, including the school district officer, went into the school minutes later.
During that terrifying time — well over an hour — parents of students who were trapped in the school gathered outside the building as word spread of the shooting.
Some of the parents implored the heavily armed police officers at the chaotic scene to storm the school.
We need precision riflemen, negotiators.”As the officers fell, the gunman continued shooting, said the state police official.

There were 142 spent rounds found inside the school, McCraw said, along with 173 live rounds.

     Summary: “At that point, if they proceeded any further not knowing where the suspect was at, they could’ve been shot, they could’ve been killed, and that gunman would have had an opportunity to kill other people inside that school,” Olivarez said.
"They could've been shot.
They could've been killed," Texas police lieutenant explains why law enforcement did not go into Uvalde school right away.
Olivarez said that was “correct,” explaining some of the uncertainty faced by law enforcement in Uvalde.
“He actually said the cops were reluctant to engage the shooter because, ‘They could’ve been shot.

     Summary: The Uvalde local police, and state police, have also given conflicting accounts of their actions while the shooter was in the school building.
At 11:35 am, police officers — including members of the Uvalde Police Department and the Independent School District Police Department, the school district’s designated police force — had entered the school.
Half an hour later, there were a total of 19 officers in the school, McCraw said Friday.
Uvalde police officers kept them from going in, McCraw said, even though they had heard gunfire.
The Uvalde Police Department has previously touted its SWAT team on social media, but it is unclear whether that team responded to the shooting.

     Summary: Placeholder while article actions loadThe police response to the Texas school massacre was led by the chief of a six-officer police department that oversees about eight schools.
Officers waited nearly an hour inside Robb Elementary School before a group stormed into the classroom and confronted 18-year-old Salvador Rolando Ramos.
A spokeswoman for the Uvalde Police Department referred inquiries to the Texas Department of Public Safety, and requests to the local district attorney’s office went unanswered.
In March, the school district police hosted active shooter training at Uvalde High School, according to a post on the agency’s Facebook page.
It notes that an armed school resource officer remained outside the Parkland high school rather than confronting the gunman, bringing criticism upon himself and his department.
