     'Top Gun: Maverick': Val Kilmer cameo, health woes explained
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warning: Radar shows “Top Gun: Maverick” spoilers ahead.
AdvertisementBecause of Kilmer’s condition, throat cancer was written into his character for “Top Gun: Maverick” — a movie in which he wasn’t always a lock to appear.
Val Kilmer, seen here in the documentary “Val,” which addresses his struggles with throat cancer, wasn’t a shoo-in for “Top Gun: Maverick.” But star Tom Cruise insisted Kilmer be in it.
(A24)But when Maverick and Iceman finally get together on screen again, that’s where we see something really alive.
But it’s what he does wordlessly in his “Top Gun: Maverick” cameo, and its connection to his own life, that speaks volumes.

     Val Kilmer's 10 Best Movies, According To Ranker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Val Kilmer has made a triumphant return in Top Gun: Maverick, but what are his best movies as seen by the movie fans on Ranker?
One of the most emotionally nostalgic parts of Top Gun: Maverick is seeing the return of Iceman, reprised by Val Kilmer following a throat cancer diagnosis in 2014.
9 Top Gun (1986)While most critics favor Top Gun: Maverick over its 1986 predecessor, Ranker voters feel the opposite thus far.
2 Heat (1995)Most cinephiles and casual moviegoers would agree that Heat is one of Kilmer's best, most epic, and unforgettable movies to date.
1 Tombstone (1993)In many ways, it's great to see arguably Val Kilmer's finest screen performance rated by Ranker as his best movie to date.
