     Summary: Edmonton captain Connor McDavid scored at 5:03 of overtime, bringing the Oilers to victory over the Calgary Flames 5-4 on Thursday night in Game 5 of the second-round playoff series, and advancing them to the Western Conference finals.
Zach Hyman had a goal and two assists and Darnell Nurse, Jesse Puljujarvi and Evan Bouchard each also scored for the Oilers.
Mike Smith made 32 saves, helping Edmonton claim the first postseason Battle of Alberta in 31 years.
The Oilers will face either the Colorado Avalanche or St. Louis Blues in their first conference final appearance since 2006.

     Controversial overturned goal helps Edmonton Oilers eliminate Calgary Flames in Game Five
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Edmonton Oilers are moving on to the Western Conference Final but they aren’t doing so without some controversy.
Late in the third period of Game Five, it looked like the Calgary Flames had taken the lead through a Blake Coleman skate redirection.
The play then went under review and apparently, enough evidence was found to overturn the goal.
While being checked from behind and in the middle of falling, Coleman guides the puck over the redline with his skate.

Final/OT Edmonton Oilers 5 Calgary Flames 4After going down 2 early in the second period the Edmonton Oilers scored 3 goals in a row to take a lead.
That is tied with the most all time in a 5 game series with Rick Middleton.
For the Edmonton Oilers to be fully satisfied and to win the Stanley Cup they still need 8 more wins.
The Edmonton Oilers will have to pick up their play from this round to the next, just like they did going from the Los Angeles Kings to the Calgary Flames.

     Summary: The Battle of Alberta didn't end as the Calgary Flames hoped.
And now, with that bitter sting fresh in their system, the Flames have major decisions to make in the off-season.
Some of that is on Flames goalie Jacob Markstrom, who allowed a whopping 25 goals to Edmonton in their five-game series victory.
They looked nothing like the Calgary team that shut out their opponents 11 times this year – nearly 15 percent of the regular-season.

CALGARY — The Calgary Flames didn't go quietly, but they still went with the controversial disallowing of a potential game-winning goal hanging over their exit.
Calgary was holding McDavid off the scoresheet for the first game in the series until his OT winner.
After a 9-6 win over the Oilers in a wild Game 1, the Flames were outscored 19-11.
In the "what-ifs" surrounding Calgary's playoff ouster, a Flames' back end lacking playoff experience needed a healthy Chris Tanev to help counter Edmonton's firepower.

     Summary: The Flames played with offensive impatience, which left room for the Oilers to fly back the other way.
Too often it became a track meet, and with that style imposed on the series, the Flames, ironically, were cooked.
Evander Kane said yes; he’s on pace to threaten the all-time playoff goals record of 19 (he has 12, so if they Oilers play two more rounds ...
It was the perfect change in a game McDavid didn’t have an inch of room and couldn’t create much or drive play.
In Game 5, the Oilers had 18 slot shots to the Flames' nine.
