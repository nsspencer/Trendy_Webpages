     Police Response to Uvalde Shooting Infuriated Parents Clinging to Hope
    </h2>

     Summary: He went through an unlocked door at 11:40 a.m., Mr. Escalon said, and began shooting inside.
Police officers, including the school district officer, went into the school minutes later.
During that terrifying time — well over an hour — parents of students who were trapped in the school gathered outside the building as word spread of the shooting.
Some of the parents implored the heavily armed police officers at the chaotic scene to storm the school.
We need precision riflemen, negotiators.”As the officers fell, the gunman continued shooting, said the state police official.

     Summary: It was 'wrong' not to confront the Uvalde school shooter sooner, an official saysEnlarge this image toggle caption Dario Lopez-Mills/AP Dario Lopez-Mills/APCol. Steven McCraw of the Texas Department of Public Safety said at a Friday news conference that in hindsight it was the wrong decision to not enter the classroom sooner in Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman was located for more than an hour.
He said there were "plenty of officers" inside the school from the earliest minutes of the shootout, and as many as 19 officers from local and federal forces were in the hallway most of the time.
NPR's call to the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District police department went unanswered.
A school resource officer was not on campus when Ramos came onto the school property.
There were 142 spent rounds found inside the school, McCraw said, along with 173 live rounds.

     Police slow to engage with gunman because ‘they could’ve been shot,’ official says

     Summary: “At that point, if they proceeded any further not knowing where the suspect was at, they could’ve been shot, they could’ve been killed, and that gunman would have had an opportunity to kill other people inside that school,” Olivarez said.
"They could've been shot.
They could've been killed," Texas police lieutenant explains why law enforcement did not go into Uvalde school right away.
Olivarez said that was “correct,” explaining some of the uncertainty faced by law enforcement in Uvalde.
“He actually said the cops were reluctant to engage the shooter because, ‘They could’ve been shot.

     The Uvalde police keep changing their story
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Uvalde local police, and state police, have also given conflicting accounts of their actions while the shooter was in the school building.
At 11:35 am, police officers — including members of the Uvalde Police Department and the Independent School District Police Department, the school district’s designated police force — had entered the school.
Half an hour later, there were a total of 19 officers in the school, McCraw said Friday.
Uvalde police officers kept them from going in, McCraw said, even though they had heard gunfire.
The Uvalde Police Department has previously touted its SWAT team on social media, but it is unclear whether that team responded to the shooting.
