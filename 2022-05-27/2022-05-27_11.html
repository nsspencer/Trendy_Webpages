     Amid Gun Violence, Giants Manager Will Not Come Out for Anthem
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Gabe Kapler observed his own moment of silence sometime before the San Francisco Giants team he manages opened its Memorial Day Weekend series in Cincinnati on Friday night.
His moment came not before a national anthem nor while standing at attention at the edge of a dugout.
Instead, it occurred at a keyboard as he quietly filtered his own grief and outrage into a fiery blog post under the headline, “Home of the Brave?”He then tweeted the post, describing it with one sentence: “We’re not the land of the free nor the home of the brave right now.”

     Giants Manager Gabe Kapler Pens Message in Wake of Uvalde Shooting
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In response to the mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler wrote an essay titled “Home of the Brave?” expressing his concern with the state of the country’s gun violence.
He explains how he considered kneeling out of protest, but his body ultimately wouldn’t let him.
The home of the brave should encourage this.”The incident happened on Tuesday, when a reported 18-year-old gunman killed 19 children and two adults in Robb Elementary School in Uvalde.
Kapler published the essay on Kaplerstyle.com, a website that he occasionally uses to publicize his thoughts on certain issues.
Last year, he wrote an essay titled “Sports Are Everyone,” which touched on the lack of inclusivity in sports.

     San Francisco Giants Manager Gabe Kapler Will Not Be A Part Of National Anthem Ceremonies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The mass shooting this week at a Texas school has prompted San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler to invoke his own form of protest.
Before the Giants faced the Reds on Friday in Cincinnati, Kapler said he wouldn’t participate in any on-field national anthem ceremonies until he could feel better about the country’s direction.
However, that could change if the Giants make the playoffs or if Kapler is a coach at baseball’s mid-summer All-Star Game.
Ironically, Kapler’s national anthem protest comes the same week that the action’s professional sports originator, Colin Kaepernick, received a quaterback tryout with the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders.
I stood for the national anthem.
