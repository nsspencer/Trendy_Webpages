    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 4:58 p.m.Just hours after a law enforcement official acknowledged responding officers made the “wrong decision” to not stop the shooter, Texas Gov.
Greg Abbott (R) initially steered clear of the topic during a news conference about victims.
Instead, he spoke of resources to aid the victims’ families, asking state officials to come forward to talk about government efforts and announcing a $175,000 anonymous donation to pay for funeral expenses.
When reporters repeatedly asked about the law enforcement’s response, Abbott said he would only answer questions about the resources available to victims at first, days after he praised the responding officers.

     Summary: “At that point, if they proceeded any further not knowing where the suspect was at, they could’ve been shot, they could’ve been killed, and that gunman would have had an opportunity to kill other people inside that school,” Olivarez said.
"They could've been shot.
They could've been killed," Texas police lieutenant explains why law enforcement did not go into Uvalde school right away.
Olivarez said that was “correct,” explaining some of the uncertainty faced by law enforcement in Uvalde.
“He actually said the cops were reluctant to engage the shooter because, ‘They could’ve been shot.

     Summary: The Uvalde local police, and state police, have also given conflicting accounts of their actions while the shooter was in the school building.
At 11:35 am, police officers — including members of the Uvalde Police Department and the Independent School District Police Department, the school district’s designated police force — had entered the school.
Half an hour later, there were a total of 19 officers in the school, McCraw said Friday.
Uvalde police officers kept them from going in, McCraw said, even though they had heard gunfire.
The Uvalde Police Department has previously touted its SWAT team on social media, but it is unclear whether that team responded to the shooting.
