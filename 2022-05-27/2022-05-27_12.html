     Summary: LINCOLNTON, Ga. (WRDW/WAGT) - It’s Memorial Day weekend, and though many of us are making plans, it’s important we remember the meaning of it all.
Kyle McCloud owns Back Paddle Brewing in Lincolnton, where the crowd picks up around Memorial Day weekend.
He served 11 years in the Navy and says Memorial Day is more than just having a three-day weekend.
“Memorial Day is not the celebration of the average veteran.
Memorial Day is really for those who didn’t make it either that war overseas or the war at home,” he said.

     Summary: Blakesly says some have confused honoring Memorial Day with celebrating it instead.
“I’ve had a lot of people tell me, “Happy Memorial Day” and you know it’s not really a time to be happy," said Blakesly.
Number one being Armed Forces Day, that’s a day set aside to honor those who are currently wearing the uniform.
Memorial Day is a day to remember those who died, but never got out of uniform and they died in their uniform," said Blakesly.
Not knowing whether we would need it again or not, but if we needed to we’d put it on and go back in.”What used to be "Decoration Day," but now Memorial Day was first observed back in 1868 after the Civil War.

AS LONG AS HE CAN AT HILLCREST CEMETERY IAdvertisement Greater Cincinnati veterans share why Memorial Day goes beyond barbecues, festivals Share Copy Link CopyAs Memorial Day weekend arrived, an aging veteran wearing a red Marine shirt and an American Legion cap walked slowly up a hill at Hillcrest Cemetery and situated himself on a wooden bench to reflect a bit.Don Bishop told us Memorial Day had lost some of its meaning over the years.
His knees won't let him move the way he used to, but he's still all about restoring it.For many Americans, the extended Memorial Day holiday weekend won't involve gravesites or flags or reflection.
And at cemeteries like Hillcrest where carefree holiday activities wouldn't be possible without the sacrifices that lie in the ground.
"The best part about Memorial Day is that people get to enjoy the barbecues," Alvarez said.

     The Meaning of Memorial Day
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: I was born on Memorial Day, but it would take me 25 years to fully comprehend why this federal holiday exists.
By the time my only brother, Nicholas Oresti Cherava, enlisted, my father had passed, but his commitment to sacrifice, selflessness and camaraderie still echoed.
Memorial Day has always been significant to my family as a time to honor the fallen and to remember everyone who has passed in our lives.
NPCA at Work Working with Veterans to Protect National Parks NPCA’s veterans program meaningfully engages the military community — including veterans, active duty, reservists and military families — to support national parks through service projects and advocacy.
Before moving to Colorado at the end of 2011, I would return to the Marine Corps Memorial every October 6 with flowers and a penny in memory of Nicholas.
