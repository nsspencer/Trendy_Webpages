     49ers news: Deebo Samuel hilariously narrates George Kittle TD
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 49ers may have been without Deebo Samuel during their Week 15 win over the Seahawks, but that didn’t stop him from having fun with the action.
San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle might want to thank his teammate, wide receiver Deebo Samuel, for a couple of different things from the Week 15 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday Night Football.
For starters, Samuel didn’t play because of the knee and ankle injuries suffered during the Niners’ Week 14 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
And while Samuel is expected to be back soon, his absence helped ensure Kittle would be a primary target for quarterback Brock Purdy.
49ers WR Deebo Samuel does play-by-play call of George Kittle touchdownRecording live from his home, Samuel posted up the story on his Instagram account (h/t NBC Sports Bay Area) of him calling Kittle’s touchdown.
