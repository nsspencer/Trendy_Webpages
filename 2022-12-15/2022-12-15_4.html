    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: James Cameron's "Avatar: The Way of Water" snared $17 million during its Thursday night previews on its way towards a $175 million opening weekend.
Premium formats will be a big factor in the film's opening weekend and its overall box office run.
EntTelligence estimates that for "The Way of Water" 3D tickets will average around $16.50 each while 2D will cost around $12.50 a piece.
Meanwhile, in Asia-Pacific, which includes Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, 39% of box office receipts were for these more expensive showings.

     'Avatar: The Way of Water' Feels Like a Three-Hour Disney Ride
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: On Wednesday I attended the New York Imax 3D premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water and felt a similar thrill that lasted much longer.
My comfortable seat didn't move, and no wind or mist sprayed me like at Disney, but the feeling was just as intense.
When the plot, pacing and premise fell short, I didn't really care, and even brief motion sickness didn't spoil my fun.
David Katzmaier/CNETAs CNET's reviewer of televisions I've seen a lot of great-looking films, and Avatar: The Way of Water is one of the best.
I prefer to think of Avatar: The Way of Water as an immersive ride controlled by a skilled director.

     ‘Avatar 2’ Cast Breakdown: See the Faces Behind All the Na’vi in ‘The Way of Water’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: James Cameron’s “Avatar: The Way of Water” is now playing in theaters, and with it comes a question moviegoers will probably be asking themselves once the credits roll: What does the cast actually look like?
That’s not the case with “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which, for most of its three-hour runtime, includes no human actors on-screen.
That’s not to say “Avatar: The Way of Water” is without its humans.
The rest of the “Avatar: The Way of Water” main cast all appear as Na’vi courtesy of motion capture.
See all of the faces behind the Na’vi characters in the cast breakdown below.

     Summary: Now Miles has returned, sort of, in the form of a Na’vi whose mind is infused with the late colonel’s memories.
The Sully clan flees the forests of Pandora and reaches a remote island, where most of the movie’s action takes place.
Cameron’s display of the enticements and wonders of the Metkayina way of life is at once the dramatic and the moral center of the movie.
Putting the movie’s design in the forefront does “The Way of Water” no favors.
Cameron’s new island realm is a land without creativity, without personalized ideas, inspirations, imaginings, desires.

     Can James Cameron’s striking ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ pull off a box-office smash?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: And will the sequel eventually rival the $2.9-billion total gross of the original film, released in 2009?
In “The Way of Water,” the marine-turned-alien Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his blue-skinned counterpart Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) have become parents to three children who fight against human invaders.
‘Avatar’ did all of that just as YouTube was hitting its stride, let alone Netflix and streaming,” said Levitan.
Levitan feels the plot of the first “Avatar” was largely forgettable and did not possess much of a cultural footprint — unlike Cameron’s “Alien, and “Terminator” franchises.
