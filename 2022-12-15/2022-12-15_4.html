     Heat’s injury report vs. Rockets features nearly entire roster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Nope, that’s not how many players the Miami Heat have available for Thursday night’s matchup against the Houston Rockets.
Shockingly, that’s the number of players on their roster that have popped up on the injury report.
The Heat pretty much listed their entire roster on the official injury report for Thursday’s bout against the 9-18 Rockets.
This is perhaps the most important aspect of the injury report with Bam Adebayo, Kyle Lowry, and Caleb Martin all listed as either questionable or out.
The Heat’s backcourt is going to be very shorthanded, though, with Lowry, Gabe Vincent, and Victor Oladipo all listed as out.

     Butler expected to play, but Adebayo ruled out. Here’s Heat injury report vs. Rockets
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Miami Heat needed to play without star Jimmy Butler in Wednesday’s win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.
On Thursday night, the Heat will take on the Houston Rockets without Butler’s co-star Bam Adebayo.
Butler is expected to play Thursday after sitting out Wednesday’s contest as part of the Heat’s injury management plan for his right knee.
But Adebayo will miss Thursday’s matchup against the Rockets at Toyota Center on the back end of the back-to-back set because of a sprained left ankle.
Cain and Jovic, who were spending time with Miami’s G League affiliate, rejoined the Heat in Houston for Thursday’s game against the Rockets to help provide depth to a short-handed roster.
