     TNF: The Seahawks are in the playoff hunt, who woulda thunk it?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Week 15 kicks off with an NFC West rivalry between the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks.
It’s been a while since a Niners-Seahawks game this late in the season had playoff ramifications for both teams.
A seventh consecutive win for San Francisco would be the first time it has accomplished that since 2019.
So, falling to 7-7 while one of those teams improves to 8-5-1 could be detrimental to Seattle’s playoff push.
Another variable in this game for the Seahawks will be facing this San Francisco offense for the first time with Christian McCaffrey.

     Summary: December 15, 2022 at 2:00 PM ESTEntering this season, there was a glaring gap between what the Seahawks believed they were capable of and what the public and NFL pundits believed they could accomplish.
Carroll knew what he wanted his team to be, and he knew he could get this version of the Seahawks there.
The Geno Smith-led Seahawks have arguably been the best story in the NFL this season.
But we’re two days ahead of Seattle’s most important game of the season — a prime-time bout against the first-place San Francisco 49ers with the Seahawks’ season virtually on the line — and a new narrative has emerged.
There’s now a glaring gap between what the Seahawks believed they could be and what they actually are.

     Summary: Brock Purdy put the NFL on notice after leading the San Francisco 49ers (9-4) to a victory last week, but can he do it again in primetime against Geno Smith and the Seattle Seahawks (7-6)?
The rookie third-string QB outplayed Tom Brady in a pivotal Week 14 game, relying on the 49ers' plentiful array of weapons to do so.

     Summary: With multiple high-end fantasy stars on both sides, let’s dig into the battle of the NFC West between the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks.
However, the Seahawks' defense needs a bit more than reflection to keep the team from another shootout.
Seahawks Pass Defense by Game fantasy analysis.
John Wolford is the only quarterback without at least one passing touchdown against the Seahawks since Week 9.
With Walker just coming off an injury, I'd look elsewhere for a star performance at running back in Week 15.
