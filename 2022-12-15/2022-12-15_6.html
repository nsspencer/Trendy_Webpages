     'Beauty and the Beast' live: H.E.R. as a guitar-shredding Belle is the princess vibe we deserve
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A network biting off more than it should chew?
Luckily, the artists at the center of the live performances and dance numbers brought the show to life in a way that brought a castle’s-worth of magic to the stage in a vibrant display that more than adequately honored the beloved 1991 movie.
Perhaps it was a testament to the casting — David Alan Grier as an appropriately salty Cogsworth, Martin Short as Lumière, Shania Twain as twangy Mrs. Potts – that one could be left wanting more, especially given the hit-and-miss nature of the live shows that have preceded it.
But most credit should go to H.E.R., Josh Groban and an outstanding Joshua Henry in the roles of Belle, Beast and Gaston, respectively.
If this is what Disney leans into in forthcoming princess iterations, be our guest.

#BeautyAndTheBeast30th's Beast costume reminds me of the Broadway #KingKong and not in a good way pic.twitter.com/uiIdsAgAPP — GoAskAlice (@GoAskAlice67) December 16, 2022Unlike Shaggy’s red leather suit in “The Little Mermaid Live!” “Beauty and the Beast” slayed the costume game.
Like “The Little Mermaid Live!,” many of the final “Beauty and the Beast” moments were left to play out through movie clips.
There was however a moment in which a sunglass-clad Belle takes out an electric guitar and starts rockin’ to it.
There was not much acting in “Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration,” as most of the live portions focused on the musical numbers.
