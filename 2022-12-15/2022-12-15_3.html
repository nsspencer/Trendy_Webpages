     Seahawks Trail 49ers at Halftime After Brutal Momentum-Changing Fumble
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Seattle Seahawks showed signs of life late in the first half Thursday night against the San Francisco 49ers but fumbled away a chance at potentially snatching away the lead.
The Seattle Seahawks played arguably their worst game of the season in a 27-7 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in Week 2.
The Seahawks finally showed life on the shoulders of receiver DK Metcalf, who had back-to-back 13-yard catches to spark the offense midway through the second quarter.
Suddenly, despite what was fixing to be disastrous first half for the Seahawks was now one that could end with them in the lead.

     TNF: The Seahawks are in the playoff hunt, who woulda thunk it?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Week 15 kicks off with an NFC West rivalry between the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks.
It’s been a while since a Niners-Seahawks game this late in the season had playoff ramifications for both teams.
A seventh consecutive win for San Francisco would be the first time it has accomplished that since 2019.
So, falling to 7-7 while one of those teams improves to 8-5-1 could be detrimental to Seattle’s playoff push.
Another variable in this game for the Seahawks will be facing this San Francisco offense for the first time with Christian McCaffrey.

     49ers-Seahawks on Thursday Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers (-3.5, 43.5) head to Lumen Field on Thursday night to face Geno Smith and the Seattle Seahawks.
He rushed for 119 yards with "only" 34 receiving yards last week, but he went for 80 receiving yards and only 66 rushing yards the week before.
Kittle's stats have been up and down all season, but he faces a Seahawks defense that has been torched by tight ends.
Marks: I do like Moody's Kittle over, and I'll add Marquise Goodwin over 23.5 receiving yards as well.
Goodwin plays 54% of his snaps out of the slot, where the 49ers' defense is most vulnerable.
