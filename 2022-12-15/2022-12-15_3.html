     Summary: On Thursday, former U.S. President Donald Trump released a 45,000-piece series of $99-apiece NFTs following long-awaited hints that a ‚Äúmajor announcement‚Äù would be forthcoming.
Many people had assumed the announcement would relate to Trump‚Äôs recently declared 2024 presidential campaign, but here we are.
According to the website, the proceeds from the launch‚Äîalready ‚Äúsold out!‚Äù‚Äîwill ‚Äúhave nothing to do‚Äù with financing the Trump campaign.
Interesting Trump NFT admin wallet pre-minted 1000 (2%) but has 25% of the 1/1s and 33% of the autographs.
Trump's NFT launch also comes exactly one year after former First Lady Melania Trump launched her own NFT on Solana.

     Allies of Trump befuddled by NFT venture, fueling concerns over direction of 2024 campaign
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Instead, the NFTs appear to be a new extension of Trump‚Äôs business portfolio.
But instead of adding juice to his flagging campaign, Trump‚Äôs NFT announcement appears to have sowed more doubt about his overall strategy.
Trump‚Äôs announcement came the same day his campaign released the first of a series of policy videos focused on ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù and aimed to refocus Trump‚Äôs lagging campaign.
However, none of that will go toward his political campaign, according to the website where Trump‚Äôs digital trading cards are being marketed.
Trump hasn‚Äôt responded to the criticism of his NFT launch, and his campaign has been silent on the matter.
