     How to stream San Francisco 49ers vs. Seattle Seahawks on Prime: Thursday Night Football Week 15
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers visit the Seattle Seahawks for Thursday Night Football in NFL Week 15 at Lumen Field on Thursday, December 15 (12/15/2022).
Instead, Thursday Night Football is exclusive to Amazon Prime Video, which offers a 30-day free trial, through the end of the year.
Right now, they’re on the bubble, but a win over San Francisco would give them a big leg up on the competition.
Seattle is coming off a 30-24 loss to the Panthers, while San Francisco handed the Buccaneers a 35-7 beating on Sunday.
Fans can stream the game live on Amazon Prime Video, and new subscribers will enjoy 30-days of Amazon Prime for free when they sign up.

     San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks: Predictions, picks and odds for NFL Week 15 matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brock Purdy put the NFL on notice after leading the San Francisco 49ers (9-4) to a victory last week, but can he do it again in primetime against Geno Smith and the Seattle Seahawks (7-6)?
The rookie third-string QB outplayed Tom Brady in a pivotal Week 14 game, relying on the 49ers' plentiful array of weapons to do so.
Jets | Chiefs vs. Texans | Steelers vs. Panthers | Eagles vs. Bears | Falcons vs. Saints | Cowboys vs. Jaguars | Cardinals vs. Broncos | Patriots vs.
Commanders | Rams vs. PackersLorenzo Reyes: 49ers 27, Seahawks 20This is a spot I love for San Francisco.
Richard Morin: 49ers 28, Seahawks 20It will be Brock Purdy's first test away from the Bay Area, but the Seahawks' defense has some holes that can be exploited.

     TNF: The Seahawks are in the playoff hunt, who woulda thunk it?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Week 15 kicks off with an NFC West rivalry between the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks.
It’s been a while since a Niners-Seahawks game this late in the season had playoff ramifications for both teams.
A seventh consecutive win for San Francisco would be the first time it has accomplished that since 2019.
So, falling to 7-7 while one of those teams improves to 8-5-1 could be detrimental to Seattle’s playoff push.
Another variable in this game for the Seahawks will be facing this San Francisco offense for the first time with Christian McCaffrey.

     49ers-Seahawks on Thursday Night
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers (-3.5, 43.5) head to Lumen Field on Thursday night to face Geno Smith and the Seattle Seahawks.
He rushed for 119 yards with "only" 34 receiving yards last week, but he went for 80 receiving yards and only 66 rushing yards the week before.
Kittle's stats have been up and down all season, but he faces a Seahawks defense that has been torched by tight ends.
Marks: I do like Moody's Kittle over, and I'll add Marquise Goodwin over 23.5 receiving yards as well.
Goodwin plays 54% of his snaps out of the slot, where the 49ers' defense is most vulnerable.
