     TNF: The Seahawks are in the playoff hunt, who woulda thunk it?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Week 15 kicks off with an NFC West rivalry between the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks.
It’s been a while since a Niners-Seahawks game this late in the season had playoff ramifications for both teams.
A seventh consecutive win for San Francisco would be the first time it has accomplished that since 2019.
So, falling to 7-7 while one of those teams improves to 8-5-1 could be detrimental to Seattle’s playoff push.
Another variable in this game for the Seahawks will be facing this San Francisco offense for the first time with Christian McCaffrey.

     San Francisco 49ers vs. Seattle Seahawks LIVE: TNF stream, start time, odds, predictions and injury report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: December 15, 2022 at 2:00 PM ESTEntering this season, there was a glaring gap between what the Seahawks believed they were capable of and what the public and NFL pundits believed they could accomplish.
Carroll knew what he wanted his team to be, and he knew he could get this version of the Seahawks there.
The Geno Smith-led Seahawks have arguably been the best story in the NFL this season.
But we’re two days ahead of Seattle’s most important game of the season — a prime-time bout against the first-place San Francisco 49ers with the Seahawks’ season virtually on the line — and a new narrative has emerged.
There’s now a glaring gap between what the Seahawks believed they could be and what they actually are.

     Seahawks preview: NFC West on the line in Thursday Night Football matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Seahawks have lost the last three of four games, while the 49ers are riding an NFL-best six-game winning streak.
This will be the team's second meeting this year after the 49ers outclassed the Seahawks 27-7 in the second week.
Star running back Christian McCaffrey is on the 49ers, though, and will present matchup issues for the Seahawks' defense all around the field in this matchup.
If the history of Seahawks vs. 49ers was any indication, expect a game that goes down to the wire.
