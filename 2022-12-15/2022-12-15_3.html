     Amazon acquires film/TV rights to ‘Warhammer 40,000’ IP
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon announced today that it signed a deal with Games Workshop (GAW), giving it IP rights to the “Warhammer 40,000” universe, a massively popular tabletop miniature wargame.
“Warhammer 40,000” takes place in the distant future, where humanity is threatened by aliens and supernatural beings.
Launched nearly 40 years ago, the game is continuously expanding and GAW has many miniature figures, tabletop games, video games, animations and books.
This is a notable move for the company, as the “Warhammer 40,000” universe is epic in scale and has a massive worldwide fanbase.
“Man of Steel” and “The Witcher” actor Henry Cavill is set to star and executive produce the “Warhammer 40,000” franchise.

     Forget The Witcher and Superman: Henry Cavill to lead Warhammer 40K dream project
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Warhammer 40K has been one of the most popular properties among gamers and others for almost 40 years.
Cavill posted a brief teaser to Instagram to announce his involvement:For 30 years I have dreamt of seeing a Warhammer universe in live action.
To all of you Warhammer fans out there, I promise to respect this IP that we love.
But Cavill's involvement could help alleviate fans' concerns, given that Cavill is a dedicated Warhammer 40K geek who has often talked about painting figures and other Warhammer-related activities in interviews.
Warhammer 40K is set in the very distant future (the 40K roughly refers to the years when it takes place) that is analogous in some ways to what historians used to refer to as Europe's Dark Ages.
