     1 Stud And 1 Dud From Cavs’ Win Over Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Road victories have been hard to come by for the Cleveland Cavaliers so far this season, but they got a solid one on Wednesday by beating Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks, 105-90.
The Cavs got the win largely with defense, and they forced the Mavs to shoot under 40 percent from the field and held Doncic to an inefficient 30 points.
But star power was also important for Cleveland, and it was their newest star who stood out the most.
Donovan Mitchell Did WorkCavs fans are starting to get used to the fact that most of the time, Donovan Mitchell is an absolute stud.
On Wednesday, he dropped 34 points while shooting an outstanding 13-of-20 from the field and 6-of-9 from 3-point range.

     2 studs and 1 dud for Cavs from Wednesday’s win over the Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The three-time All-Star, who missed two games over the weekend with lower leg soreness, led the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 105-90 win over Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night.
As usual, Luka Doncic was the guy who tried to keep the Mavericks in the game all night.
Outside of Doncic, the Mavericks got only 34 combined points from the rest of their starting lineup, not to mention, not a single player in that group, Doncic included, had a (+/-) higher than -15.
As for the Cavs, Mitchell proved his worth yet again, but also had some help from an unlikely source.
Before the Cavaliers start their biggest homestand of the year beginning on Friday night, let’s take a look at who stood out for the Cavaliers last night.

Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY SportsThe Cleveland Cavaliers were able to defeat the Dallas Mavericks thanks to Donovan Mitchell outdueling Luke Doncic.
The Cleveland Cavaliers were able to get the hard fought win over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday.
The matchup saw Donvoan Mitchell and Luke Doncic trade shots all night, with Mithcell edging out the over-worked Doncic.

     ‘He is a complete player’ - Luka Doncic lauds Donovan Mitchell after Cavs’ win: What they’re saying about the Cavaliers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CLEVELAND, Ohio – Life was tough for the Dallas Mavericks in the paint on Wednesday night.
The Cavaliers have two 7-footers in Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley and a vicious defender in Lamar Stevens, who churned out his best game of the season.
You can point to that, or the two massive first-half runs totaling 33-2 in favor of the Cavs, or Donovan Mitchell’s marvelous first half.
Jarrett Allen calls tonight's game a "redemption arc," as the @cavs were able to start the game "ready to throw the first punch."
Other sportsbooks entering the state include DraftKings Sportsbook, FanDuel Ohio Sportsbook and Barstool Ohio.

     Cavs’ interior defense posed big problems in win over Mavs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the Mavs scored just 41 points in the first half against the Cavs, Wood tallied 12 of his 20 points in the second half when Dallas scored 49 points.
MITCHELL WAS A PROBLEM: Donovan Mitchell scored more points in the first half than four of the Mavs’ starters scored in the entire game.
DONCIC SET ANOTHER RECORD: Luka Doncic is the new holder of yet another Mavs’ franchise record.
That’s a franchise record after Doncic entered the Cavs’ game co-holding the record of 34 with Mark Aguirre (Nov. 22, 1983-Feb. 1, 1984).
Doncic also is the first Mavs’ player to open a season scoring 20 or more points in his first 26 games.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: DALLAS (AP) — Donovan Mitchell said he was thankful, in a strange way, for the playoff loss to Dallas last season because it helped send him to Cleveland.
Mitchell scored 34 points facing Luka Doncic and the Mavericks for the first time since his final game with Utah last April, and the Cavaliers rolled to a 105-90 victory Wednesday night.
So I’m thankful I’m here.
Mitchell answered Dallas' fourth-quarter surge with a 3-pointer, and the Cavs led by at least 10 the rest of the way.
Mitchell was 13 of 20 overall and 6 of 9 from 3 as the Cavs shot 53%.
