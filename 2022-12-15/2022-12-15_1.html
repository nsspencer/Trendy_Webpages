     49ers-Seahawks inactives: Brock Purdy to play in key Week 15 NFC West clash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After much concern that 49ers’ rookie quarterback Brock Purdy could be sidelined for their NFC West showdown vs. the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday, 49ers fans can worry no more.
ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter first reported Thursday morning that Purdy was expected to play.
Earlier this week, Purdy made it known that he is ready and well-prepared for a “hostile” environment in Seattle against San Francisco’s division rivals.
Additionally, 49ers defensive lineman Kerry Hyder Jr. and cornerback Ambry Thomas, who were both listed as questionable on the team’s final injury report of the week, will also be active for Thursday night’s game.
The 49ers also promoted defensive lineman Akeem Spence to the active roster and activated cornerback Janoris Jenkins and wide receiver Willie Snead IV.

     49ers QB Brock Purdy expected to start vs. Seahawks despite oblique, ribs injuries: Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rookie quarterback Brock Purdy is expected to start for the 49ers against the Seahawks in Seattle on Thursday despite oblique and rib injuries, according to ESPN reporter Adam Schefter.
The 49ers took Purdy with the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft (262nd overall) after a standout career at Iowa State.
San Francisco (9-4) leads Seattle (7-6) by two games in the NFC West.
The 49ers currently sit third in the NFC playoff standings, while the Seahawks are eighth, meaning one spot outside the playoffs heading into Week 15.
And most of all, how will it affect his passing, especially on deep balls on which he has to put his whole body – and twist his torso – into the throw?

     Summary: To make it even sweeter, they accomplished it in primetime to win the NFC West division.
The 49ers are an unstoppable force after running over the Seahawks in their 21-13 win to clinch the NFC West.
They struggled immensely to do much of anything against the 49ers defense.
If it wasn't for multiple penalties against the 49ers defense, the Seahawks offense would've had an uglier game.
They proved that yet again tonight by making the Seahawks look like they do not belong on the same field as them.

     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers will have their starting quarterback Brock Purdy under center for their second meeting with the Seattle Seahawks in primetime.
The rookie quarterback was listed as questionable headed into this "Thursday Night Football" game after being limited all week with oblique and rib injuries sustained in the team's Week 14 matchup versus the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
"This is probably the most hostile environment that you could probably play in," Purdy said.
With the victory last weekend, Purdy became the first quarterback to make his first-career start against Tom Brady and come away with a win.
The team also promoted defensive lineman Akeem Spence to the active roster and activated cornerback Janoris Jenkins and wide receiver Willie Snead IV.

But, after impressive showings in one and a half weeks’ worth of work, Purdy has already appeared to win over one of the franchise’s all-time greats.
When asked this week if he believes the 49ers can go all the way, Joe Montana told USA Today that he likes their chances if Purdy continues to play like he did in Week 14.
Purdy, making his first career start, completed 16-of-21 passes for 185 yards with three total touchdowns in a 35-7 home win over Tom Brady and the Buccaneers.
Entering Week 15, the 49ers ranked first in total defense, allowing 286.8 total yards per game and 15.2 points per game.

     Summary: Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers (-3.5, 43.5) head to Lumen Field on Thursday night to face Geno Smith and the Seattle Seahawks.
He rushed for 119 yards with "only" 34 receiving yards last week, but he went for 80 receiving yards and only 66 rushing yards the week before.
Kittle's stats have been up and down all season, but he faces a Seahawks defense that has been torched by tight ends.
Marks: I do like Moody's Kittle over, and I'll add Marquise Goodwin over 23.5 receiving yards as well.
Goodwin plays 54% of his snaps out of the slot, where the 49ers' defense is most vulnerable.

     Summary: The win, which marked San Francisco’s seventh straight, officially clinched the NFC West and got the 49ers a guaranteed spot in the postseason.
Kittle was about as open as he could possibly be after the Seahawks defense bit on a double Purdy pump fake.
The 49ers defense, which had been outstanding all night, gave up a late touchdown to Noah Fant in the final minutes.
Purdy finished throwing 17-of-26 for 217 yards with two touchdowns, both to Kittle — who had 93 yards on four catches.
McCaffrey had 108 yards on 26 carries in what was his second straight game with 100 rushing yards.
