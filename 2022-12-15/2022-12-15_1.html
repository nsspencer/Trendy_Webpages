     Trump’s ‘Major Announcement’ Was To Hawk His $99 NFTs
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ToplineFormer President Donald Trump unveiled Thursday a “limited edition collection” of NFT trading cards featuring cartoon-like images of himself depicted as a superhero, Hollywood actor and more, after teasing a “major announcement” on his Truth Social account.
The rollout comes after Trump told his 4.73 million Truth Social followers on Wednesday “America Needs a Superhero,” while teasing a “major announcement” he said would come Thursday.
NFT trading volume declined 97% between January and September of this year amid uncertainties about the stability of the digital asset market, according to data obtained by Bloomberg.
The November collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange, which hosted NFTs, have further dented the NFT market.
TangentThe “major announcement” comes on the heels of a particularly rough month for Trump, who announced his third bid for the presidency on November 15.
