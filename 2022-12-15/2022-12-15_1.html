     Summary: As the DC universe continues to get shaken like a snowglobe, a new Superman will rise—this one written by new DC Studios head James Gunn, with a story set earlier in the Man of Steel’s life.
If you just groaned, take a small bit of heart: Gunn said it’s not a Superman origin story (which absolutely no one needs at this point), but it’s clearly a reset of sorts.
https://t.co/Haz1APdlVN — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) December 15, 2022This new shake-up comes on the heels of some industry back-and-forth about the fate of Wonder Woman 3.
Jenkins, like Gunn, took to Twitter to make a statement:The role of Matt Reeves’ Batman is also somewhat up in the air, apparently.

     Summary: CNN —No, we aren’t getting the old Superman back, but James Gunn has dropped some information about what’s to come for the DC superhero.
After Henry Cavill posted that he will not be returning as Superman in the DC film franchise, Gunn started a Twitter thread on Wednesday.
In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman’s life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill,” Gunn tweeted.
Gunn tweeted that he has been writing a new Superman movie “for a while,” adding “We don’t know who is directing yet.”When a follower asked about having Ben Affleck, who has starred as Batman, directing a Superman movie, Gunn didn’t rule it out.
“Met with Ben yesterday precisely because he wants to direct &amp; we want him to direct; we just have to find the right project,” Gunn tweeted.

Gunn and Safran were hired to lead DC Studios this October, and this is their first major project announcement since taking over.
— James Gunn (@JamesGunn) December 15, 2022The news comes amid a major shake-up at DC Studios’ owner, Warner Bros.

Discovery to release a different “Superman” film, produced by J.J. Abrams and written by novelist Ta-Nehisi Coates, are still moving forward, Variety reported.

     Summary: Things are heating up in Metropolis, as DC Studios co-head James Gunn has announced he is writing a new feature film about Superman.
In step with the new project, Gunn has also revealed that Henry Cavill will not return as the hero.
In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman’s life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill.
After being told by the studio to announce my return back in October, prior to their hire, this news isn’t the easiest, but that’s life,” Cavill wrote.
Additionally, Variety sources said the new Gunn project will not replace the previously announced J.J. Abrams-Ta-Nehisi Coates Superman concept (which is still in active development).

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s one of the things that makes James Gunn, so recently installed in his new position as co-head of Warner Bros. Discovery’s DC Studios, refreshing: Gunn ’s a guy who’s always prided himself on transparency, talking plainly, often on social media, with fans about his stances on his films, characters, comic book opinions, etc.
It’s “entirely untrue,” in Gunn’s phrasing.
There’s clearly some kind of communication issue at or around DC Studios at the moment; someone is telling vetted industry publications like Variety and THR this stuff, forcing Gunn to quash the rumors and suggestions back down on what’s becoming a weirdly regular basis.
S o questions about what Gunn and Safran are planning are obviously rampant right now.
For now, Variety has updated its story to log Gunn’s disavowal of the Bat-Pats rumors.

     James Gunn Denies Reports About 'The Batman' Merging Into DCU Canon
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Unsurprisingly, Warner Bros. signed a deal with Reeves to work on a sequel and different spinoff series.
Since the movie passed the box office test, Gunn and Safran could easily convince Warner Bros.
Discovery, and still offer fans a cohesive and beloved vision of the DC universe.
For starters, canonizing Pattison’s Batman would mean burning Ben Affleck’s Dark Knight, another nail in the coffin of the Snyderverse.
Still, Pattison's Batman doesn't seem to fit with other successeful properties, such as Gunn's The Suicide Squad and David F. Sandberg's Shazam!
