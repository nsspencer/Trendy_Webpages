     Biden mocks Trump’s ‘major announcement’ of digital trading cards
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: President Biden on Thursday mocked former President Trump for teasing a “major announcement” that turned out to be a new line of digital Trump trading cards.
Trump posted on Truth Social a day earlier that he would be making a “major announcement” without providing any details.
Instead, Trump revealed a line of digital trading cards that could be purchased with cryptocurrency or a credit card.
“Thank God, the digital trading cards are here.
It was indeed a MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT,” Daily Wire founder Ben Shapiro tweeted.

     Donald Trump Wants to Sell Bizarre NFT ‘Trading Cards’ of Himself for $99

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Donald Trump, the twice-impeached former U.S. president, is hoping to rake in some cash by shilling digital NFT trading cards depicting him in various scenes and weird fantasy scenarios, including a couple of him portrayed as a “Superman”-like superhero.
The site says 45,000 Trump Digital Trading Cards will be created in the initial series.
The Trump NFTs include one of him dressed in a superhero costume — with lasers shooting out of his eyes — as he stands in front of Trump Tower.
“Collect all of your favorite Trump Digital Trading Cards, very much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting… Only $99 each!
“No Trump Digital Trading Card will have more than 20 copies in existence!” the site exclaims.
