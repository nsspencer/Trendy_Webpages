     NFL World Has Conflicting Reactions to 49ers-Seahawks Uniform Matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Thursday Night Football matchup between the 49ers and the Seahawks caused some polarizing views for the NFL world watching at home.
However, the conflicting reactions had nothing to do with the action on the field.
Instead, the NFL world said a lot about the uniform matchup between the two teams.
The 49ers wore their white throwback uniforms from 1994, while the Seahawks sported their bright “Action Green” uniforms, which first debuted in 2016.
While most people liked the 49ers’ throwback uniforms, a majority of people did not like the Seahawks highlighter green uniforms.

     49ers QB Brock Purdy expected to start vs. Seahawks despite oblique, ribs injuries: Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rookie quarterback Brock Purdy is expected to start for the 49ers against the Seahawks in Seattle on Thursday despite oblique and rib injuries, according to ESPN reporter Adam Schefter.
The 49ers took Purdy with the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft (262nd overall) after a standout career at Iowa State.
San Francisco (9-4) leads Seattle (7-6) by two games in the NFC West.
The 49ers currently sit third in the NFC playoff standings, while the Seahawks are eighth, meaning one spot outside the playoffs heading into Week 15.
And most of all, how will it affect his passing, especially on deep balls on which he has to put his whole body – and twist his torso – into the throw?

     49ers-Seahawks inactives: Brock Purdy to play in key Week 15 NFC West clash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After much concern that 49ers’ rookie quarterback Brock Purdy could be sidelined for their NFC West showdown vs. the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday, 49ers fans can worry no more.
ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter first reported Thursday morning that Purdy was expected to play.
Earlier this week, Purdy made it known that he is ready and well-prepared for a “hostile” environment in Seattle against San Francisco’s division rivals.
Additionally, 49ers defensive lineman Kerry Hyder Jr. and cornerback Ambry Thomas, who were both listed as questionable on the team’s final injury report of the week, will also be active for Thursday night’s game.
The 49ers also promoted defensive lineman Akeem Spence to the active roster and activated cornerback Janoris Jenkins and wide receiver Willie Snead IV.

     Summary: SEATTLE — The 49ers on Thursday placed defensive tackle Hassan Ridgeway on injured reserve, which appears to signal the end of his season.
The 49ers signed veteran defensive tackle Akeem Spence to the 53-man roster to be available to play Thursday night against the Seattle Seahawks.
The 49ers also elevated veteran cornerback Janoris “Jackrabbit” Jenkins and wide receiver Willie Snead from the practice squad.
The 49ers will go into the game with two quarterbacks in uniform after opting not to elevate Jacob Eason from the practice squad.
The 49ers are allowed to activate only two more players off injured reserve this season to reach the maximum of eight.

The rookie quarterback was listed as questionable headed into this "Thursday Night Football" game after being limited all week with oblique and rib injuries sustained in the team's Week 14 matchup versus the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
"This is probably the most hostile environment that you could probably play in," Purdy said.
With the victory last weekend, Purdy became the first quarterback to make his first-career start against Tom Brady and come away with a win.
The team also promoted defensive lineman Akeem Spence to the active roster and activated cornerback Janoris Jenkins and wide receiver Willie Snead IV.

     Summary: Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers (-3.5, 43.5) head to Lumen Field on Thursday night to face Geno Smith and the Seattle Seahawks.
He rushed for 119 yards with "only" 34 receiving yards last week, but he went for 80 receiving yards and only 66 rushing yards the week before.
Kittle's stats have been up and down all season, but he faces a Seahawks defense that has been torched by tight ends.
Marks: I do like Moody's Kittle over, and I'll add Marquise Goodwin over 23.5 receiving yards as well.
Goodwin plays 54% of his snaps out of the slot, where the 49ers' defense is most vulnerable.
