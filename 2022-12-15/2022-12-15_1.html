     Summary: Arizona Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury said Wednesday that quarterback Kyler Murray won't have surgery to repair his torn ACL until after Christmas.
The Cardinals signed Murray to a five-year, $230.5 million extension in July, including $189.5 million in guaranteed money.
The Cardinals signed quarterback David Blough off Minnesota's practice squad Wednesday to take Murray's spot on the 53-man roster, one of several moves by the team.
Williams was out of standard elevations from the practice squad while Whittaker takes the roster spot of Trayvon Mullen, who was released Tuesday.
Arizona also signed rookie quarterback Carson Strong to the practice squad.

Geno Smith threw for 238 yards and Seattle’s first offensive TD this season against the 49ers, but was under constant pressure.
The fumble was returned 35 yards by Charvarius Ward, and two plays later, McCaffrey scored to give the 49ers a 14-3 lead.

     Summary: "If the 49ers finish this season in the manner that they started and sustained with, I'm OK with saying this is the best 49ers defense in the history of the 49ers organization," Whitner said.
A former 49ers safety himself, Whitner was part of San Francisco's hard-hitting defense that helped the team reach three consecutive NFC Championship Games from 2011 to 2013.
"This 49ers defense, only giving up 15 points per game," Whitner said.
Major players on each level of the defense: Nick Bosa, two Pro Bowl linebackers in Dre Greenlaw and Fred Warner, and, in my opinion, two Pro Bowl defensive backs in [Talanoa] Hufanga and Charvarius Ward."
With what Whitner believes is the best defense fans have ever had the privilege to watch, the sky is the limit.

     Summary: SEATTLE -- The San Francisco 49ers clinched the NFC West with a 21-13 win over the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday night.
While the Niners will continue to fight for playoff seeding in the NFC, the Seahawks' playoff chances drastically declined after the loss.
San Francisco 49ersFor the second time in four years, the 49ers are NFC West division champions.
Lessons from going all-in and the long-term fallout Bill Barnwell 2 RelatedAt 10-4 and 5-0 in the NFC West division, the Niners can drop no lower than the No.
Facing a third-string quarterback who didn't have his best offensive weapon in Samuel, the Seahawks watched the 49ers clinch the NFC West in their building by controlling the game from start to finish.

     Summary: That’s what counts, and it was what helped deliver San Francisco the NFC West title with Thursday night’s win.
Through three (nearly full) games, he’s thrown for six TDs and one INT and completed nearly 67% of his passes.
A lot of forces were working against Smith against the 49ers, and let’s be honest: These issues have been brewing for a while.
Seattle lucked out when Kittle missed the 49ers’ first matchup between the two teams, but Thursday was his payback.
There were 72 of them called through the first 208 games this season (average of one every 2.9 games) through Week 14.

     Why Brock Purdy can Lead the 49ers to the Super Bowl
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the win against Seattle, Brock Purdy showed exactly why he is the right quarterback to lead the 49ers to the Super Bowl.
This could've easily happened to the San Francisco 49ers when Brock Purdy took over for the injured Jimmy Garoppolo.
In fact, he showed something in that win that proves why he can lead the 49ers to the Super Bowl.
That has been lacking from a 49ers quarterback ever since Kyle Shanahan took over as head coach.
San Francisco looks like a team that can win multiple playoff games and make a Super Bowl with Purdy being a contributing factor.
