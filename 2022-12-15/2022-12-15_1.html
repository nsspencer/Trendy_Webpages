     49ers QB Brock Purdy expected to start vs. Seahawks despite oblique, ribs injuries: Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rookie quarterback Brock Purdy is expected to start for the 49ers against the Seahawks in Seattle on Thursday despite oblique and rib injuries, according to ESPN reporter Adam Schefter.
The 49ers took Purdy with the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft (262nd overall) after a standout career at Iowa State.
San Francisco (9-4) leads Seattle (7-6) by two games in the NFC West.
The 49ers currently sit third in the NFC playoff standings, while the Seahawks are eighth, meaning one spot outside the playoffs heading into Week 15.
And most of all, how will it affect his passing, especially on deep balls on which he has to put his whole body – and twist his torso – into the throw?

     Summary: SANTA CLARA, CA - DECEMBER 11: Brock Purdy #13 of the San Francisco 49ers celebrates the touchdown ... [+] against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Levi's Stadium on December 11, 2022 in Santa Clara, California.
San Francisco is first in weighted DVOA and, though Seattle is a respectable 11th, the weakness of the Seahawks’ defense is one logic dictates the 49ers should have no problem exploiting.
There is an argument the 49ers defeated better teams than Seattle with Purdy under center in the last two weeks in knocking off the Miami Dolphins and the Buccaneers.
All things being equal, the 49ers should win this game handily and seal the NFC West title.
Yet Seattle, with the help of the Seahawks’ crowd, has succeeded in consistently tilting this matchup in its favor.
