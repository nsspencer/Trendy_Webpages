     49ers QB Brock Purdy expected to start vs. Seahawks despite oblique, ribs injuries: Report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Rookie quarterback Brock Purdy is expected to start for the 49ers against the Seahawks in Seattle on Thursday despite oblique and rib injuries, according to ESPN reporter Adam Schefter.
The 49ers took Purdy with the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft (262nd overall) after a standout career at Iowa State.
San Francisco (9-4) leads Seattle (7-6) by two games in the NFC West.
The 49ers currently sit third in the NFC playoff standings, while the Seahawks are eighth, meaning one spot outside the playoffs heading into Week 15.
And most of all, how will it affect his passing, especially on deep balls on which he has to put his whole body – and twist his torso – into the throw?

     49ers-Seahawks inactives: Brock Purdy to play in key Week 15 NFC West clash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After much concern that 49ers’ rookie quarterback Brock Purdy could be sidelined for their NFC West showdown vs. the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday, 49ers fans can worry no more.
ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter first reported Thursday morning that Purdy was expected to play.
Earlier this week, Purdy made it known that he is ready and well-prepared for a “hostile” environment in Seattle against San Francisco’s division rivals.
Additionally, 49ers defensive lineman Kerry Hyder Jr. and cornerback Ambry Thomas, who were both listed as questionable on the team’s final injury report of the week, will also be active for Thursday night’s game.
The 49ers also promoted defensive lineman Akeem Spence to the active roster and activated cornerback Janoris Jenkins and wide receiver Willie Snead IV.

Purdy was a limited participant in practice all week and is listed as questionable with rib and oblique injuries.
He sustained the injuries during the 49ers' 35-7 romp over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.
He also rushed for a score for San Francisco (9-4), which could clinch the NFC West title with a win over Seattle (7-6) on Thursday night.

     Summary: Four years ago, then-18-year-olds Brock Purdy and Tyrese Haliburton entered Iowa State together to play collegiate football and basketball for the Cyclones, respectively.
Purdy’s college success and mature mindset have helped prepare him for this moment with the 49ers, Haliburton believes.
At the end of the day, Purdy still is a rookie and mistakes will happen.
He works really, really hard,” Haliburton said.
“I’m a Brock Purdy fan,” he concluded.

     Summary: That help can start on Thursday night, when the 7-6 Seattle Seahawks host the 9-4 San Francisco 49ers.
With a win, the 49ers can clinch the NFC West, making them essentially irrelevant for the Lions playoff odds, as Detroit is eyeing a Wild Card spot, instead.
That’s where the Seattle Seahawks come into play.
If you’re more of a mathematical person, here’s how the Lions’ playoff odds change based on a couple different probability models.
