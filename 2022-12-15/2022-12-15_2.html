     San Francisco 49ers vs. Seattle Seahawks LIVE: TNF stream, start time, odds, predictions and injury report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: December 15, 2022 at 2:00 PM ESTEntering this season, there was a glaring gap between what the Seahawks believed they were capable of and what the public and NFL pundits believed they could accomplish.
Carroll knew what he wanted his team to be, and he knew he could get this version of the Seahawks there.
The Geno Smith-led Seahawks have arguably been the best story in the NFL this season.
But we’re two days ahead of Seattle’s most important game of the season — a prime-time bout against the first-place San Francisco 49ers with the Seahawks’ season virtually on the line — and a new narrative has emerged.
There’s now a glaring gap between what the Seahawks believed they could be and what they actually are.

     Summary: The Seahawks have lost the last three of four games, while the 49ers are riding an NFL-best six-game winning streak.
This will be the team's second meeting this year after the 49ers outclassed the Seahawks 27-7 in the second week.
Star running back Christian McCaffrey is on the 49ers, though, and will present matchup issues for the Seahawks' defense all around the field in this matchup.
If the history of Seahawks vs. 49ers was any indication, expect a game that goes down to the wire.

     Seahawks Add RB Depth vs. 49ers, Elevate Godwin Igwebuike From Practice Squad
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earning a promotion to the game day roster for the second time in five days, the Seahawks elevated running back/kick return specialist Godwin Igwebuike from the practice squad to face one of his former teams on Thursday Night Football.
Moments later, Jason Myers connected on a short field goal to make it a 20-17 game.
But with DeeJay Dallas likely to miss a second straight game, his presence will provide backfield insurance in case they need him to step in at some point.
Unlike the past several weeks, Seattle didn't use its second practice squad elevation, choosing to go into Thursday's game with 54 players on the game day roster.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: : The Seahawks have covered 8 of the last 11 meetings in Seattle and 15 of the last 22 meetings overall.
Nor did I think Brock Purdy and the San Francisco offense would manage much in Purdy's first career start.
Brock Purdy and San Francisco did not stick to the script.
Also, it's a short week, and while Purdy will play tonight, he did suffer an oblique strain, so he won't be at 100%.
That tells me he's more likely to play tonight, which makes the Heat attractive at this number against a Houston squad that's been awful defensively this season.

     49ers-Seahawks inactives: Brock Purdy to play in key Week 15 NFC West clash
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After much concern that 49ers’ rookie quarterback Brock Purdy could be sidelined for their NFC West showdown vs. the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday, 49ers fans can worry no more.
ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter first reported Thursday morning that Purdy was expected to play.
Earlier this week, Purdy made it known that he is ready and well-prepared for a “hostile” environment in Seattle against San Francisco’s division rivals.
Additionally, 49ers defensive lineman Kerry Hyder Jr. and cornerback Ambry Thomas, who were both listed as questionable on the team’s final injury report of the week, will also be active for Thursday night’s game.
The 49ers also promoted defensive lineman Akeem Spence to the active roster and activated cornerback Janoris Jenkins and wide receiver Willie Snead IV.

     Summary: National Football League Seahawks' Legion of Gloom defense returns as Christian McCaffrey, 49ers invade Seattle 4 hours ago share facebook twitter reddit linkSeattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Clint Hurtt thought he had fixed his team's leaky run defense earlier this season.
Since Week 10, the Legion of Gloom has allowed 838 rushing yards, second-worst in the league to the New York Giants (848) during that span.
The Seahawks gave up 101 rushing yards in the fourth quarter alone in last week's 30-24 loss to the Carolina Panthers.
"When you play the run game, it's a six-second fist fight," Hurtt told reporters this week.
Christian McCaffrey leads San Francisco's ground game, with 819 rushing yards and nine total touchdowns on the year, including his time with the Panthers.
