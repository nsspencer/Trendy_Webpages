     Summary: Seahawks wide receiver Tyler Lockett will have surgery to repair and stabilize a fracture in his hand, Seattle head coach Pete Carroll said Friday.
What they’re sayingSeahawks quarterback called Metcalf “a leader on this team, leader on this offense.”“And he’s a guy that we rely on, that I rely on,” quarterback Geno Smith said.
“So, we have guys that are willing to step up.
I look forward to seeing those guys step up in their new roles, but you can never replace a guy like Tyler.
I’m just pulling for him to get back as soon as possible.”Required reading(Photo: Gary A. Vasquez / USA Today)

     Summary: SEATTLE -- If the Seahawks are going to turn their recent slide around in time to make the playoffs, they'll likely have to do it without Tyler Lockett.
Penny was injured on Aug. 13, had surgery two days later and was back for the Seahawks' Sept. 9 opener.
"There's a couple different ways that they can do the surgery," Carroll said.
The things that he does for the organization, that he does for this team, he's one of the vocal leaders, he's a captain for a reason.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A disheartening defeat on Thursday night for the Seattle Seahawks had the added sting of one of their top players possibly being lost for the season.
Wide receiver Tyler Lockett suffered a broken finger against the San Francisco 49ers, Seattle head coach Pete Carroll announced after the game, and there is uncertainty as to whether he'll be able to play again this season.
"Tyler Lockett broke a bone in his hand -- in his index finger," Carroll said.
On the evening, Lockett had seven catches for 68 yards, with his six-game streak with a touchdown reception coming to a close.
For the season, Lockett has 78 receptions for a team-high 964 yards.

     Summary: That’s what counts, and it was what helped deliver San Francisco the NFC West title with Thursday night’s win.
Through three (nearly full) games, he’s thrown for six TDs and one INT and completed nearly 67% of his passes.
A lot of forces were working against Smith against the 49ers, and let’s be honest: These issues have been brewing for a while.
Seattle lucked out when Kittle missed the 49ers’ first matchup between the two teams, but Thursday was his payback.
There were 72 of them called through the first 208 games this season (average of one every 2.9 games) through Week 14.
