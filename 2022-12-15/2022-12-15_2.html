Then there is the fine print:•The NFTs do not correspond to ownership of the images.
•Buyers will need self-custody digital wallets to receive the NFTs, though they can be purchased with just an email address.
The only intrinsic value the cards seem to offer is the availability of the images for noncommercial viewing.
In a frequently asked question section (FAQ), the website specifies that what makes them special is that they are the first authorized Trump trading cards.

     Flow Hits New Low After NFT Trading Craters, Dapper Downsizes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: NFT trading on Flow has fallen sharply in recent months, and Dapper Labs held layoffs in November.
Flow surged to prominence in early 2021 as NBA Top Shot led the charge for NFTs into the mainstream.
It notched a record $14.3 million in trading volume in September, but then fell to nearly $6.7 million in October and $3.6 million in November.
While Flow’s NFT trading has declined more sharply than other popular networks like Ethereum and Solana in recent months, the broader NFT market has lost significant momentum since early this year.
The market yielded $5.36 billion of organic NFT trading volume in January, per data from DappRadar, but just $643 million in November.

     Donald Trump’s NFT Sale Is the Weirdest Thing on Social Media Today
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: According to the fine print of the website selling the Trump images, the proceeds won’t go to his campaign.
OpenSeas.io, one of the major websites where NFTs are bought and sold, reported that about 4 percent of the Trump NFTs were posted for sale there.
In February, it was revealed that she had purchased all $185,000 worth of the Melania Trump NFTs herself.
One of the few actual names on the NFT website is that of digital artist Clark Mitchell, who put the images together.
According to Mitchell’s website—he did not respond to a request for comment—he makes digital art for celebrities and brands.

     Who convinced Donald Trump that Trump NFTs were a good idea?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Donald Trump, a guy who used his name to sell everything from steaks to water, the idea would be irresistible.
By January, there were more than 322,000 sales of collectible NFTs a week, generating hundreds of millions of dollars.
The third problem with Trump’s effort is that the entire thing is far more Trump Steak than Trump 2016.
Trying to get people to pony up $99 for a picture of Trump dressed as a NASCAR driver for some reason?
I got out of the Trump-prediction-making game back on Nov. 8, 2016, so I will make no predictions about whether Trump’s NFT play will work.
