     Summary: and Josh Groban weigh in on whether the Beast is hotter in his human formIt's a controversy as old as time... or at least as old as 1991.
When the Beast, as voiced by Robby Benson, transforms back into a man formally known as Prince Adam, he's... not very cute?
Can Groban break not only the Enchantress' curse, but also undo the long-held audience belief that the Beast is, unfortunately, far hotter as a Beast than a man?

He's looking good.
