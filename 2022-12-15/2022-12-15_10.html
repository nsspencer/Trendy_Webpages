     Mavericks announce Maxi Kleber out indefinitely with hamstring tear
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks announced Thursday that reserve forward Maxi Kleber will be out for an extended period of time after suffering a tear to his right hamstring at a team practice on Tuesday.
Kleber, who turns 32 next month, blossomed into a reliable two-way player after coming over from Wurzburg, Germany.
And even in his reserve role, Kleber has been a mainstay of closing lineups for the team.
The Mavericks made moves for two big men in the offseason, trading for Wood and signing center JaVale McGee to a three-year deal.
The timing of this injury couldn’t be worse as the Mavericks try to find any consistency in their play.

Cuban now sees a new Mavericks arena as a potential economic driver for the city and state as the centerpiece of a Las Vegas-style casino and resort located in the heart of Dallas.
“My goal, and we’d partner with Las Vegas Sands, is when we build a new arena, it’ll be in the middle of a resort and casino,” Cuban told The Dallas Morning News.
But you’re talking about billions of dollars in revenue,” Cuban told The News.
“It’ll take seven years to do everything right, so 2024 is when we’ve got to make a decision,” Cuban told The News.

The team is saying Kleber tore his hamstring during practice on Tuesday and is out indefinitely.

     What Maxi Kleber's Injury Means For Dallas Mavericks

     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks will be without Maxi Kleber for a long period of time after the team announced on Thursday that the 30-year-old suffered a right hamstring tear at practice recently.
However, their depth took a massive hit on Thursday when the team announced that veteran forward Maxi Kleber is out indefinitely with a right hamstring tear.
Mavs PR: “The Dallas Mavericks announced today that forward Maxi Kleber suffered a tear of his right hamstring at practice on Tuesday, December 13.
Another name to consider in trade talks for the Mavericks is Atlanta Hawks’ forward John Collins.
The most important factor for the Mavericks is that they cannot lose intensity on the defensive-end of the floor in wake of Maxi Kleber’s injury.

(John Fisher/Getty Images)Dallas Mavericks forward Maxi Kleber tore his right hamstring during Tuesday's practice, the team announced.
Kleber is expected to miss six-to-eight weeks, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania.
Kleber played 31 minutes in Monday's victory against the Oklahoma City Thunder, including the entire fourth quarter.

     Mark Cuban has Vegas-like vision for Dallas, new Mavs arena if Texas OKs casino gambling
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “I would say the conditions for the passage of casino gambling are better today than any other time,” said Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist.
The Sands that year funded a TV blitz to remind Texans that five-star resorts and casino gambling would generate thousands of jobs and considerable tax revenue.
Still, when the University of Houston’s Hobby School of Public Affairs surveyed Texas in 2021, more than half (58%) favored allowing casino gambling.
Cuban said he has no idea how Texas’ gambling timeline will play out, but there’s no reason for him to stop envisioning the possibilities.
And it’s not just gambling; there’s gambling in a lot of places.
