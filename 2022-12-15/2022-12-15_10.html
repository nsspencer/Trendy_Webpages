     Summary: You often are who your record says you are in the NFL, but Drew Brees feels the New Orleans Saints are better than their 4-9 tally suggests.
“They’re not a 4-9 team, but they’re 4-9,” Brees conceded, pointing to some things the team has done well that were undercut by too many low moments, bad breaks, and self-inflicted wounds.
So Brees knows better than most what so many frustrations can do to a team’s morale.
It’s a bad process that’s led to bad results, and the Saints are worse off for it.
This team is worse than the sum of its parts, and a lot of that comes down on coaching.
