     Summary: Richard Sherman may be out of the NFL, but that doesn’t mean he forgot what people said about him, especially when he left Seattle.
The former Seahawks cornerback, who won a Super Bowl in Seattle, was invited to appear on the "Brock and Salk" radio show Wednesday by former teammate K.J.
… Again, you’re excused from the interview," Sherman said.

     Former NFL Star Richard Sherman Demands Radio Host ‘Excuse’ Himself From Own Show In Cringe Back And Forth
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former NFL cornerback Richard Sherman demanded a Seattle sports talk radio host step away from his show so Sherman wouldn’t have to talk to him.
“I’m gonna answer the questions from Brock and K.J., but we’re gonna excuse you out of this.”Salk quickly defended himself, trying to smooth it over with Sherman.
“The words you heard from me were actually pretty similar to what you heard while you were here.
Sherman explained he was only on the show because Wright asked him to join the segment.
“That’s the only reason I’m here is because of K.J.,” Sherman continued.

     Richard Sherman, Erin Andrews recount infamous interview together
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The one where Richard Sherman called Michael Crabtree a sorry receiver after winning the 2013 NFC Championship?
Sherman swatted the ball away, which was intercepted by teammate Malcolm Smith to close out the game.
The post-game interview helped cement Sherman in the national consciousness as a shut-down corner at the time and an elite-level trash talker.
The former Super Bowl-winning-cornerback-turned-NFL-analyst revisited the infamous soundbite along with Erin Andrews, who had been interviewing Sherman.
Andrews co-hosts The Calm Down podcast with fellow NFL host and reporter Charissa Thompson and Sherman — who also hosts his own podcast — was a recent guest.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Former Seahawks and 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman will be part of Amazon’s broadcast team for tonight’s game.
We’re sure to get some interesting insights from Sherm during the stream, but he’s already made headlines ahead of his game over an interview on ESPN 710 yesterday.
Sherman was a guest on the Brock &amp; Salk show along with former teammate K.J.
He refused to take any questions from Mike Salk, though.
Sherman did answer questions from Wright and Brock Huard, but continued to stonewall Salk throughout the interview, which was cut short as a result.

     Richard Sherman has cringeworthy sports radio exchange
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Richard Sherman joined a local sports radio morning show in Seattle this week and the former Seahawks star opened the interview with a cringeworthy exchange.
Apparently, Sherman has a major issue with Salk, which came across as news to the radio host.
And when Salk attempted to respond, Sherman quickly cut him off to reiterate, “Again, you’re excused from the interview.”“It doesn’t really work that way, Sherm,” Salk said.
“That’s the only reason I’m here, is because of K.J.” Sherman said.
Sherman also once targeted another Seattle sports radio host, Salk’s former colleague Jim Moore.

    </h2>

     Summary: They have him under a rookie contract still, but either this offseason or next offseason they’re gonna have to pay him.
“Outside of the Chargers, if the Broncos were to make a change I think they’d probably make a run at him.
“I really think with Sean the two things are gonna be geography and quarterback,” he said.
“Cause I do think he’s enjoying what he’s doing right now, and unless the situation is perfect for him, I could see.
Now I think he’s gonna coach again, I don’t think he’s done for good.
