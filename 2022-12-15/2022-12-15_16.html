     Summary: CHICAGO — RJ Barrett scored 27 points and the New York Knicks again used 3-point shooting to beat the Chicago Bulls, 114-91 on Friday night to sweep the two-game set and run their winning streak to six.
Jalen Brunson and Quentin Grimes each added 22 points to help the Knicks follow their 128-120 overtime victory over the Bulls on Wednesday night.
The Knicks outrebounded Chicago 50-39 and held an opponent to fewer than 100 points for the fifth time during the winning streak.

And this organization, he meant a lot to the organization, but the organization means a lot to him too."
But for those few moments at the end of the fourth quarter, the nostalgia clouded the scoreboard.

     Summary: The Bulls steadied the ship and actually had the Knicks on their heels in the final five minutes of the second quarter, pulling ahead 48-41.
Aiding that spurt was the Bulls committing seven second quarter turnovers.
Although the Knicks only converted three points off those takeaways, it disrupted the Bulls' offensive rhythm after a scalding start.
Matters only devolved further in a third quarter the Knicks won 29-22 to carry a 12-point lead into the fourth quarter.
Together, they closed the second quarter meekly (-11 in 4:45), opened the third quarter similarly (-6 in 6:40) and were completely listless in a fourth quarter stretch they were outscored 12-0.

     Summary: The Knicks took care of business as their new usual, taking two from the Bulls in Chicago to push their winning streak to six games.
The New York Knicks (16-13) defeated The Chicago Bulls (11-17) by a final score of 114 to 91.
Completing a two-game stretch in Chicago, the Knicks faced their toughest matchup of the winning streak earlier in the week in the Bulls.
Isaiah Hartenstein, in the midst of a rough season, did a good job with some stops at the rim, too, making the Bulls’ offense rather one-dimensional.
The New York Knicks travel to the Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana to face the Indiana Pacers (15-14) on Sunday, November 18th.

     Summary: CHICAGO — Every time Derrick Rose comes back to the United Center, it feels like the first time.
“That’s Derrick Rose, man,” DeMar DeRozan said.
But I’m guessing he’ll do something in Chicago, and that should include a relationship with his old team.
We’ve done it enough with that Bulls team because the years since haven’t been very uplifting.
