     Tyler Perry Joins Celebrities Buying Out Performances of Broadway Play ‘Ain’t No Mo’

     Summary: Tyler Perry is the latest Hollywood star to step in and buy out a performance of the Broadway show Ain’t No Mo in the hopes of helping the play reverse its plans to close.
Perry has an equity stake in BET+ and many shows on BET, which is a co-producer on Ain’t No Mo.
Asked why Perry decided to support the Broadway play, the media mogul cited the talent of Cooper, who is also the creator of The Ms. Pat Show on BET+.
Unlike A Strange Loop, which is about a Black man struggling with his Blackness, Ain’t No Mo is unapologetically Black,” Perry said in a statement.
“We think it’s wonderful Tyler is supporting Ain’t No Mo and new Black voices on Broadway.
