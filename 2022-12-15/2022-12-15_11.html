The Atlas Lions may have been regarded by many as underdogs but you do not get to a World Cup semifinal with just luck.
“Perhaps Morocco’s performance at this World Cup will be enough to persuade FIFA delegates to finally award the tournament itself to Morocco after several failed bids in the past.
They were only recognised by FIFA in 1992 and yet ended their first-ever World Cup campaign with a third-place finish just six years later.
“This World Cup has been about ‘the last dance’ for so many of Modric’s contemporaries,” he said.

     World Cup predictions: Back Hakim Ziyech shots in Morocco vs Croatia third-place playoff
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jones Knows has been banging in the World Cup winners and he has more betting angles to consider in the final two games of a pulsating tournament.
That can be seen in the fact there has only been one draw after 90 minutes in the 19 World Cup third-place playoff matches.
That should certainly be the case this year with two teams who will see the chance of finishing third at a World Cup as a big motivation factor.
A quick, basic draw down of the total match shots in the last 14 third-place playoffs shows that each match is providing 31.2 shots per 90 minutes.
However, if you stretch it back throughout history, the average goal count in a World Cup final is 3.2 in 90 minutes.

     Summary: December 17, 2022 at 7:03 AM ESTThere were huge doubts over whether Croatia would even come close to matching the success they enjoyed at the 2018 World Cup.
Mario Mandzukic retired internationally and the players who were in their prime in Russia had moved well into their 30s.
But, led by a 37-year-old Luka Modric, Zlakto Dalic’s side showed that age is just a number.
Dejan Lovren is 33, Modric is 37, Marcelo Brozovic is 30 and Ivan Perisic is 33.
There are, of course, younger players around them like Mateo Kovacic and Dominic Livakovic but those four represent their nation’s core.
