     Ratings: LEGO Masters Flat With Finale, Survivor Grows vs. Year-Ago Finale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the latest TV show ratings, CBS’ Survivor finale led Wednesday both in the demo and in total viewers, with #OneChicago away for the holidays.
CBS | Survivor‘s three-hour season-ender averaged 4.8 million total viewers and a 0.7 demo rating, improving on its year-ago finale (which did 4 mil and a 0.7).
FOX | The newly renewed LEGO Masters drew 1.3 mil/0.3 and then another 1.3 mil/0.3 with its finale, steady week-to-week but down from its previous closer (1.4 mil/0.5).
THE CW | A Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer encore did 650K/0.1, followed by the Masters of Illusion holiday special’s 540K/0.1.
These numbers (Nielsen fast nationals, unless denoted as finals) instead aim to simply illustrate trends or superlatives.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Are You Satisfied By The 'Survivor' 43 Finale?
Well, Survivor 43 is in the books and the last few weeks really built to a crescendo at the right time, though I’m finding it difficult to be satisfied with how the season ultimately played out.
Let’s recap: This was a season with all the new advantages and was populated almost exclusively by Survivor superfans.
After that, a Survivor first: Two players beat a drowning challenge and the producers had to just give up and award two immunities.
Thanks to the impertinence of youth, Sami flamed out in royal fashion, but Survivor needs beats like that to keep it fun.

In the game you’re solely thinking about your game and getting to the end, and I had 24 hours to process Owen’s game, Cass’s game, Gabler’s game.
There was also a point in Cody’s vote-out where Cass knew about me having Cody’s idol, Owen knew about me having Cody’s idol, Gabler did not.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In terms of his “Survivor Resumé,” Jesse was nearly over-qualified to be the Sole Survivor.
One benchmark that I always have used is that a Survivor season is only as great as its winner.
The final vote tally was seven for Gabler, with James casting the lone vote for Cassidy (poor Owen finished with zero).
We got our first look at the next season, Survivor 44, which premieres on March 1st, 2023.
Look for my two season-ending lists posting soon: “Most Memorable Survivor Seasons” and “All-Time Survivor Winners,” updated through Survivor 43.

     Summary: The Tribe Has Spoken Subscribe to our Survivor Newsletter:Well, that Survivor finale was… a finale.
By looks of social media reactions, it seems most viewers did not have Gabler winning Survivor Season 43 on their Bingo card.
Perhaps the Survivor edit made it clear to some that Jesse’s thrilling long game would come to a heartbreaking end in the Fire Making Challenge.
Based on the season’s edit and the finale pitches, do you think the right player won Survivor Season 43?

     Summary: After such an audacious move, Gabler, Karla, Cassidy, and Owen were all sure they’d be able to vote him out next.
But even without the advantage in the challenge, Owen pulls out a fantastic immunity win at the final five.
Like Jesse, Karla has also revealed herself to be a bit villainous these last few weeks.
Instead, he was a puppet, an anonymous extra vote for Jesse and Cody or whoever he was aligned with that week.
I’ve disagreed with so many decisions this game; I should’ve seen the anticlimactic Gabler win coming.
