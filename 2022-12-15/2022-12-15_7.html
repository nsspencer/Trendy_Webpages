     Summary: Charlie Baker will be the next president of the NCAA, stepping in to lead an organization with diminished power amid sweeping change across college sports.
“When you consider the priorities that we have right now in the NCAA, it’s hard to imagine a better fit than Governor Baker,” said Baylor President Lind Livingston, who is the chairwoman of the NCAA Board of Governors.
He also had two sons who played college football and his wife, Lauren, was a gymnast in college.
That includes College Football Playoff, which is on the verge of expanding from four teams to 12.
