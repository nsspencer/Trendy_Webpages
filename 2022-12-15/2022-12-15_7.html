     Summary: And by “summer camp,” we mean sitting down for the most anticipated (and campiest) 2023 theatrical release next July: Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.
The titular and tentpole Mattel doll has had over 200 careers, but no role on her résumé has ever been “live-action movie star” ... until now.
The official logline for Barbie, which is being co-produced by Mattel Films, Heyday Films, and LuckyChap Entertainment (Robbie’s banner), is: “Barbie lives in Barbie Land and then a story happens.”Oookay.
That doesn’t tell us anything at all about the plot of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie!
But, some rumors, based on Robbie’s own Letterboxd account, have been swirling since this past June when first-look images were released.

     Helen Mirren Confirms That Was Her in the Barbie Trailer—And There’s More
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “Since the beginning of time, since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls,” Mirren says in the preview, an unexpected homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Barbie lowers her sunglasses and winks once to nearby girls playing with their baby dolls, who immediately drop or violently smash their toys.
Mirren admits that the film “was a bit of a disaster, really,” but her relationship with Gerwig thankfully survived the movie’s memory.
Two years later, she earned a follow-up Oscar nomination for writing 2019’s Little Women, which Gerwig also directed.
In a cover story for Vanity Fair, Robbie spoke about adapting the iconic Mattel product through her production company LuckyChap Entertainment.
