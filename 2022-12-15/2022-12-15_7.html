     How to stream San Francisco 49ers vs. Seattle Seahawks on Prime: Thursday Night Football Week 15
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The San Francisco 49ers visit the Seattle Seahawks for Thursday Night Football in NFL Week 15 at Lumen Field on Thursday, December 15 (12/15/2022).
Instead, Thursday Night Football is exclusive to Amazon Prime Video, which offers a 30-day free trial, through the end of the year.
Right now, they’re on the bubble, but a win over San Francisco would give them a big leg up on the competition.
Seattle is coming off a 30-24 loss to the Panthers, while San Francisco handed the Buccaneers a 35-7 beating on Sunday.
Fans can stream the game live on Amazon Prime Video, and new subscribers will enjoy 30-days of Amazon Prime for free when they sign up.

     TNF: The Seahawks are in the playoff hunt, who woulda thunk it?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Week 15 kicks off with an NFC West rivalry between the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks.
It’s been a while since a Niners-Seahawks game this late in the season had playoff ramifications for both teams.
A seventh consecutive win for San Francisco would be the first time it has accomplished that since 2019.
So, falling to 7-7 while one of those teams improves to 8-5-1 could be detrimental to Seattle’s playoff push.
Another variable in this game for the Seahawks will be facing this San Francisco offense for the first time with Christian McCaffrey.
