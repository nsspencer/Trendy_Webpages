     Summary: New DraftKings Tennessee Promo Code: How Grizzlies Fans Can Win $150 Easy by Joseph SummersThe Memphis Grizzlies could take over the No.
However, Memphis has a tough opponent in the way with Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks in town.
The Bucks won’t have guard Jrue Holiday due to an illness in this matchup.
The Grizz have moved to ninth in offensive rating and sixth in defensive rating on the season, but Milwaukee ranks No.
With Holiday out, the Bucks’ defense could suffer, especially since Holiday would have been the primary option to guard Ja Morant.
