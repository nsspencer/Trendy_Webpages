     Former Meg Thee Stallion Friend, Assistant Kelsey Harris Hints At $1 Million Bribe Tory Lanez Allegedly Offered Her
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Megan Thee Stallion‘s former friend and assistant Kelsey Harris hinted at being offered a $1 million bribe from Tory Lanez amidst repeatedly invoking the fifth amendment during her testimony to prevent self-incrimination in court Wednesday.
Megan had previously accused Harris of taking a bribe from Lanez, and testified that Lanez offered her and Harris $1 million each to keep quiet, The Shade Room reported yesterday.
Kelsey Harris Invokes Fifth Amendment To Prevent Self-Incrimination, Doesn’t Deny Tory Lanez BribeHarris fifth plea reportedly didn’t affect her testimony, because the district attorney gave her immunity to testify, according to Law &amp; Crime reporter Meghann Cuniff.
Regarding what Kelsey said about the alleged $1 million bribe from Tory, it's a bit … nuanced.
Ta asked her, "Kelsey, at some point in this case, did Tory try to bribe you?"

     Kelsey Harris Testimony on Megan Thee Stallion Shooting Somehow Becomes More Confusing
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: “What happened between September and today that you forgot everything?” prosecutor Kathy Ta prompted Kelsey Harris, Megan Thee Stallion’s former friend and assistant during the second day of testimony in Tory Lanez’s felony assault trial.
According to the prosecution, Harris originally corroborated Megan’s story that Lanez shot at Megan and threatened to shoot Harris on the night of July 12, 2020.
“I told you what I’m going through,” Harris told Ta.
Ta also asked—for a second time—if Harris was the person who shot Megan.
Harris denied being contacted, bribed, or intimidated by Lanez’s defense team, but said she recalled Lanez mentioning one million dollars—as Megan did in Tuesday’s testimony.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s ridiculous,” Harris testified in the courtroom in downtown Los Angeles — a day after Megan told jurors she saw Lanez point the gun at her and fire.
Harris testified once Megan said she was ready to leave, the two women departed with Peterson’s driver, leaving Peterson behind.
(When Megan testified Tuesday, she disputed this detail, saying Peterson’s driver refused to leave the property without his client.)
She said Megan went inside alone, and “apparently a fight or something happened.”“She rushed out with Tory,” she testified.
“There was so much going back and forth, name calling (between) me and Megan, Tory and Megan, Tory and Me, Megan and Tory.”Ta asked if Harris remembered Tory saying something to the effect of, “Megan, why aren’t you telling your friend about us?”“Yes, ma’am,” she replied.
