     Mavericks announce Maxi Kleber out indefinitely with hamstring tear
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks announced Thursday that reserve forward Maxi Kleber will be out for an extended period of time after suffering a tear to his right hamstring at a team practice on Tuesday.
Kleber, who turns 32 next month, blossomed into a reliable two-way player after coming over from Wurzburg, Germany.
And even in his reserve role, Kleber has been a mainstay of closing lineups for the team.
The Mavericks made moves for two big men in the offseason, trading for Wood and signing center JaVale McGee to a three-year deal.
The timing of this injury couldn’t be worse as the Mavericks try to find any consistency in their play.

     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks “live and die" by the 3-point shot, perhaps more than any other NBA team this season.
There were only nine players shooting below 30 percent within that group of players.
Over his last four games, he's shooting 66.7 percent from deep on 12 attempts.
The Mavs will undoubtedly need Bullock to continue to convert from the perimeter.
There just isn't much room for him to impact the game offensively when his 3-point shot isn't falling.

     What Maxi Kleber's Injury Means For Dallas Mavericks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Dallas Mavericks will be without Maxi Kleber for a long period of time after the team announced on Thursday that the 30-year-old suffered a right hamstring tear at practice recently.
However, their depth took a massive hit on Thursday when the team announced that veteran forward Maxi Kleber is out indefinitely with a right hamstring tear.
Mavs PR: “The Dallas Mavericks announced today that forward Maxi Kleber suffered a tear of his right hamstring at practice on Tuesday, December 13.
Another name to consider in trade talks for the Mavericks is Atlanta Hawks’ forward John Collins.
The most important factor for the Mavericks is that they cannot lose intensity on the defensive-end of the floor in wake of Maxi Kleber’s injury.
