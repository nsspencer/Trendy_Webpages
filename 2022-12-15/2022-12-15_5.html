    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TEMPE — For the first time in the Russell Wilson era, the Denver Broncos offense resembled something of a competent unit in Week 14.
His play helped Denver put up a season-high 28 points, surpassing its previous mark of 23 from Week 4.
Adding to the team’s fifth straight defeat was the added loss of Wilson, who suffered a concussion and was replaced by Brett Rypien.
Across three seasons, all with the Broncos, Rypien has played in six games and is 1-1 as a starter.
In place of Wilson this past week, the QB went 4-for-8 for 16 yards and one touchdown to an interception.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: QuarterbackSit Russell Wilson &amp; Brett RypienHad it not been for the concussion Russell Wilson suffered last week, there would be room for quiet optimism against the Cardinals in week 14.
The red birds are allowing 20 fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks which puts them at 26th in the league.
He hasn’t lived up to the lofty expectations from his draft profile, but he’s developed a nice chemistry with Russell Wilson.
From week 10 forward, they have one game in which they posted more than four fantasy points.
The Denver defense posted 13 points against the Ravens in week 13 and held their own with four points last week against the Chiefs.

     Summary: On second down, Wilson fired a pass down the center of the field to rookie tight end Greg Dulcich.
"[That's] pretty rare, and I'm glad he's on our team," Offensive Coordinator Justin Outten said Thursday.
Throughout the game, Wilson delivered in big moments.
Wilson set up a pair of touchdown drives with his legs and converted a pair of third downs.
"It's the Russell we all know and love," Outten said.
