     Arizona Cardinals at Denver Broncos: Predictions, picks and odds for NFL Week 15 matchup
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Two teams toiling toward the bottom of the standings in their respective divisions, Kliff Kingsbury leads the Arizona Cardinals (4-9) on the road against Russell Wilson's Denver Broncos (3-10).
Meanwhile, DeAndre Hopkins, James Conner and Co. will look to overpower a stingy Broncos' defense.
Safid Deen: Broncos 24, Cardinals 17Two struggling teams meet and thankfully, there are other games on the schedule to watch.
Broncos starter Russell Wilson (concussion) may not be available, nor will Cardinals starter Kyler Murray (knee) be either.
Richard Morin: Broncos 19, Cardinals 18The Broncos have quietly improved down the stretch this season, but in a battle of backup quarterbacks, I'll take the superior Denver defense to pick up the win.

     Denver Broncos GM George Paton '100%Saf,' Wanted to Wait on Russell Wilson Extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, NFL insider Benjamin Allbright of KOARadio has indicated that Paton is "100% safe" to return as Broncos GM for 2023.
In response to replies on Twitter about the Wilson extension, Allbright said that move came about because the Walton-Penner ownership group supported it.
Allbright's insight into what happened behind the scenes gives a clearer picture of how the Wilson extension came to be.
If an owner asks a GM to do something and the GM does it, it's hard to hold that against the GM.
After all, every free-agent signing under his tenure thus far happened before the Walton-Penner ownership group took over.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: QuarterbackSit Russell Wilson &amp; Brett RypienHad it not been for the concussion Russell Wilson suffered last week, there would be room for quiet optimism against the Cardinals in week 14.
The red birds are allowing 20 fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks which puts them at 26th in the league.
He hasn’t lived up to the lofty expectations from his draft profile, but he’s developed a nice chemistry with Russell Wilson.
From week 10 forward, they have one game in which they posted more than four fantasy points.
The Denver defense posted 13 points against the Ravens in week 13 and held their own with four points last week against the Chiefs.

     Summary: On second down, Wilson fired a pass down the center of the field to rookie tight end Greg Dulcich.
"[That's] pretty rare, and I'm glad he's on our team," Offensive Coordinator Justin Outten said Thursday.

Wilson set up a pair of touchdown drives with his legs and converted a pair of third downs.
"It's the Russell we all know and love," Outten said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Instead, it could be a clash of backups in Colt McCoy for the Cardinals (4-9) and Brett Rypien for the Broncos (3-10) in what has become a less-than-tantalizing game with both teams faltering.
Earlier this season, Rypien filled in during a loss to the New York Jets as Wilson dealt with a pulled hamstring.
The Broncos have a 9-1-1 mark against the Cardinals in the regular season, including 5-0 at home.
LIFE WITH MCCOYMcCoy has completed nearly 70% of his passes this season for 702 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.
“We’re not in the situation that we want to be in, but there’s some high-character guys in there,” McCoy said.
