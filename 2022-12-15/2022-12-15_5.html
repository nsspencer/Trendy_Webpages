     Fans React To Josh Groban's "Beast Carcass"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: However, one of the most glaring features of this staged adaptation was the portrayal of the titular beast by Josh Groban.
Granted, there was nothing wrong with Groban’s musical performance, there’s a reason he was cast, but the massive puppet they had him wear was beyond bizarre.
As demonstrated by what some are calling a “massive Beast carcass,” clearly that’s not what the network was shooting for when they made Groban’s costume.
Love the costume or hate the costume, there’s no denying that it was one of the most memorable features of the production.
On top of that, it did nothing to hinder Josh Groban’s incredible vocal performance.

     Watch H.E.R. shred as Belle in ABC's live-action Beauty and the Beast show – and get a closer look at her insane "stained-glass" Fender Stratocaster
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Last night (December 15), ABC broadcast Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration, a live-action performance of the ever-popular Disney musical starring Josh Groban as the Beast, and H.E.R.
(the stage name of Gabriella Wilson) capped a performance of the show's title track with a wailing electric guitar solo, which she played using an absolute stunner of a Fender Custom Shop Stratocaster.
The Strat in question was a one-off build, envisioned by H.E.R., and brought fully to life by Fender Custom Shop Master Builder Scott Buehl.
You can see it up-close in some jaw-loosening photos – kindly provided by the Fender Custom Shop – below.

     H.E.R. and Josh Groban weigh in on whether the Beast is hotter in his human form
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: and Josh Groban weigh in on whether the Beast is hotter in his human formIt's a controversy as old as time... or at least as old as 1991.
When the Beast, as voiced by Robby Benson, transforms back into a man formally known as Prince Adam, he's... not very cute?
Can Groban break not only the Enchantress' curse, but also undo the long-held audience belief that the Beast is, unfortunately, far hotter as a Beast than a man?

He's looking good.
