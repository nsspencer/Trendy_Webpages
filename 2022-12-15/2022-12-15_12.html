     Broncos rule out Russell Wilson vs. Cardinals despite QB clearing concussion protocol
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson has cleared the league’s concussion protocol but will be held out of Sunday’s game against the Arizona Cardinals, coach Nathaniel Hackett said after Friday’s practice.
We, as an organization, after discussing and talking throughout this entire week, have decided it’s best for our organization and it’s best for Russell.
The NFL later fined the Seahawks $100,000 for an application failure of the league’s concussion protocol after the hit.
In addition to the concussion, Wilson has also dealt with shoulder and hamstring injuries this season, the latter of which forced him to miss a Week 7 start against the Jets.
The Broncos are 3-10 entering Sunday’s game and were officially eliminated from playoff contention following last week’s loss to the Chiefs.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Quarterback Russell Wilson has passed the NFL's concussion protocol, but he will not play against the Arizona Cardinals.
"As an organization, we've decided to give him another week to get ready so he's ready to go for the Los Angeles Rams," Head Coach Nathaniel Hackett said Friday.
The Broncos could elevate quarterback Jarrett Guarantano from their practice squad for their Week 15 game against Arizona.
Wilson said he felt "great all week," and he expected to be ready to play on Sunday against the Cardinals.
"I was planning to be ready to rock and roll and play for us," Wilson said Friday.

     Mile High Morning: Why Jerry Jeudy's performance vs. Chiefs could signal future success
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With Jeudy switching to the X position in Courtland Sutton's absence, Kosmider noted that the increased man coverage he faced against the Chiefs played to the third-year wide receiver's strengths.
Per TruMedia and Pro Football Focus, Jeudy's 4.67 yards per route when facing man coverage rank first in the NFL, as do his 23.3 yards per reception against man coverage.
Jeudy still faced a decent amount of zone coverage against Kansas City, and Kosmider noted that he showed significant improvement over his performance in that area through much of the season.
His 1.21 yards per route against zone coverage ranks 110th in the NFL, but on Sunday, he caught all five of his targets for 43 yards.
In both Jeudy's production in the end zone and his success against zone coverage on some more nondescript plays, Kosmider noted that the wide receiver has shown an ability to reach the height of his potential.
