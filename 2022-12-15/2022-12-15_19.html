     Pelicans look to avenge loss against Utah Jazz: Odds, injury updates, predictions for December 15

     Summary: The Pels will be shorthanded once again tonight, so will they get their act together and finally beat the dreaded Jazz?
New Orleans Pelicans vs Utah Jazz: Odds and Spread, Over/UnderThe spread has just moved to -2 for New Orleans according to Fanduel, which is a half point more than the last matchup.
The over/under is high again at 231.5, as the books don’t think the Pelicans are going to have two off nights in a row.
New Orleans Pelicans vs Utah Jazz: PredictionThe Jazz have had the Pelicans number so far this season, but the Pels have rarely played two bad games in a row, so I like them to bounce back tonight and salvage the split on the road in Utah.

     Summary: Utah Jazz guard Jordan Clarkson (00) shoots as New Orleans Pelicans forward Naji Marshall (8) defends during overtime of an NBA basketball game Thursday, Dec. 15, 2022, in Salt Lake City.
On this particular occasion, the Jazz were struggling against a Pellies squad motivated not to lose two in a row to the same opponent, following Tuesday’s blowout win by the Jazz.
Several players noted that, with seemingly every game this season being a close one, the Jazz certainly have had plenty of opportunities to hone their clutch chops.
“We just try to fight it out to the end.”And as a result, they prevailed over a highly-motivated Pelicans team, and wound up with two victories over the West’s No.
“We got a few losses that hurt us — the Rockets game, the Dallas game, all the games we’ve given up.
