     Baker Mayfield drawing trade interest from a handful of teams as NFL Draft 2022 kicks off tonight: Browns Insider
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CLEVELAND, Ohio — As the 2022 NFL Draft kicks off tonight, a handful of teams have expressed interest in trading for Baker Mayfield and the Browns could move him over the next few days.
The Panthers are one of those teams, and the Seahawks might be another.
But there are a couple of teams that haven’t yet been identified who could come forward over the weekend depending on how the draft falls.

     Summary: Getty ImagesQuarterback-needy teams will be considering using a first-round pick to acquire one tonight.
Why not consider using a lesser pick to acquire a guy who has proven that he can do it?
In 2018, amid the mess that was the last year of Hue Jackson, who was fired during the season, Mayfield was solid.
Indeed, by using a first-round pick on a quarterback, that team is basically trading a first-round pick for a quarterback who is completely unproven.
In the end, whoever trades for Mayfield could be getting the true steal of the draft.

     Summary: Baker Mayfield may not be on the board in the 2022 NFL Draft, but he’s certainly one of the buzziest names heading into Thursday night’s first round.
Mayfield, currently the odd-man-out on the Browns’ quarterback carousel after the team signed Deshaun Watson, is said to be drawing interest around the league, according to Cleveland.com’s Mary Kay Cabot.
“A handful of teams have expressed interest in trading for Baker Mayfield,” Cabot reported Thursday, including the quarterback-needy Panthers, who Mayfield, 27, has been linked to in the past.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Panthers kept alive the possibility that they could trade for Baker Mayfield when they drafted North Carolina offensive tackle Ickey Ekwonu at No.
A source told cleveland.com last week that the Panthers had the inside track to trade for Mayfield, and their strategy on Thursday night fueled the notion that it could still happen.
The Panthers don’t have another pick until the fourth round, but could try to climb back into Round 2 or 3 on Friday.
Instead of drafting a quarterback to replace Russell Wilson, the Seahawks took an offensive tackle -- Charles Cross of Mississippi State at No.

     3 Reasons Baker Mayfield is the best quarterback available during the draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With one of the weakest quarterback classes in years, the Cleveland Browns may have the best available guy in Baker Mayfield on Thursday night.
With the 2022 NFL draft just hours away, the Cleveland Browns will have a slower night after giving up their first-round pick to the Houston Texans in exchange for Deshaun Watson.
The need for quarterbacks hasn’t gone away, but this draft class has proven to be less than stellar at the position.
Does that give the Browns some leverage on dealing Baker Mayfield who remains on the roster?
Don’t take this the wrong way, there is no way that the Browns are getting a first-round pick in return for Mayfield, but you could argue he’s the best quarterback available on Thursday night.

If Baker Mayfield is not traded around the draft, he could remain on Cleveland's books for the foreseeable future.
“Honestly, it’s best player possible,” Berry said when asked what type of receiver Cleveland could target in the draft.
... [We have] no particular preference as long as they can create an impact.”Could Cleveland draft a kicker again?
The Browns, however, could have an opportunity to swing a Mayfield trade this week during the draft.

     Summary: As the NFL draft is underway, the Cleveland Browns still have quarterback Baker Mayfield on their roster.
With only a few teams with starting spots available, trade destinations seem limited to the Carolina Panthers or Seattle Seahawks.
The Panthers passed on taking a quarterback with their first pick, #6 overall, instead taking offensive lineman Ickey Ekwonu there.
Jimmy Garoppolo is expected to be more expensive in trade, and contract, than Mayfield.
All of that led Ian Rapoport to connect the dots on Carolina turning their attention to a trade for Mayfield:From our NFL Draft coverage: The #Panthers select at top OT, meaning they still need a QB.

     Summary: The two franchises considered the most likely trade destinations for Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield did not address the position in the first round of the NFL Draft Thursday night.
The Seattle Seahawks, mentioned by Mayfield as a possible landing spot, selected Mississippi State offensive tackle Charles Cross at No.
But the Browns found no immediate market for the first overall pick in 2018 because of the $18.858 million he’s guaranteed for 2022.
The first Heisman winner at the University of Oregon, Mariota was the second overall pick of the Tennessee Titans in 2015.
The first overall pick of the Los Angeles Rams in 2016, Goff is 45-37-1 in his career as a starter and made two Pro Bowls.
