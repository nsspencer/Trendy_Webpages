     Jets take Sauce Gardner with fourth overall pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesAfter a 4-13 season, the Jets came into Thursday night’s draft with plenty of needs to address on their roster and they chose to help out their 32nd-ranked defense with the fourth overall pick.
Cincinnati cornerback Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner was the Jets’ choice with the first of their two first-round picks.
He is the fourth straight defensive player off the board to start the draft.
Gardner was a consensus All-America while helping the Bearcats make it to the college football playoffs last season.
10 pick as a result of trading safety Jamal Adams to the Seahawks, so should be getting a new teammate in the near future.
