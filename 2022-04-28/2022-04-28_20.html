     NFL Source: Trade-Minded Dallas Cowboys 'Love' USC WR Drake London
    </h2>

     Summary: "(The Cowboys) love him,'' an NFL source tells us.
Drake London Drake London Drake LondonThe source adds: "But so does every other team.''
The selection of London - almost certainly only a Cowboy as a result of a blockbuster trade - would enable the Cowboys to begin restoring their wide receiving corps.
Dallas has lost talent at the position with the trade of Amari Cooper and the free agency defection of Ced Wilson.
... but it would have to be much later, because a trade up for the "loved'' London would cost Dallas its second-round pick and maybe more.

     Atlanta Falcons select USC WR Drake London with the 8th pick. Grade: B

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the eighth pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the Atlanta Falcons select Drake London, WR, USC.
There are legitimate concerns about London’s ability to separate, but as a big slot guy, he could be very special.
He signed with USC to play both sports, and saw action as a true freshman in both football and basketball.
Stat to Know: According to Pro Football Focus charting data, London led receivers with 19 contested catch receptions last year.
London also was a little inconsistent at the catch point, as he dropped eight catchable passes last season.

     How Drake London fits with the Atlanta Falcons
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This year, it was wide receiver Drake London with the No.
The Falcons came into the 2022 NFL Draft needing wide receivers.
Along with edge rushers, the position was one of the most coveted groups for the Falcons to rebuild this offseason.
1 target at wide receiver for the first time since - arguably - before the Roddy White era in Atlanta.
He'll join this core group of receivers with Zaccheaus, Tate and Darby, yes, but more importantly, London joins an offense with Pitts and Cordarrelle Patterson as offensive weapons, too.
