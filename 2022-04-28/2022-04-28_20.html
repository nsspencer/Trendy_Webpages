He signed with USC to play both sports, and saw action as a true freshman in both football and basketball.
Stat to Know: According to Pro Football Focus charting data, London led receivers with 19 contested catch receptions last year.
London also was a little inconsistent at the catch point, as he dropped eight catchable passes last season.
