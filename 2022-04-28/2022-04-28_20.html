New York selected Oregon edge rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux with the fifth overall pick and Alabama tackle Evan Neal with the seventh overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft.
Boasting a magnificent mix of speed and power, Thibodeaux's potential and production made him a candidate to be a top-five pick, while questions concerning his desire and effort plagued him during the pre-draft process.
1 overall high school prospect coming out of Oaks Christian in Southern California, Thibodeaux wasted little time making an impact with the Ducks as he produced nine sacks in his freshman year.
