     Is Jordan Davis The Right Pick At No. 17 For The Chargers?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Even with the heavy investment in run-stopping interior defensive linemen, do the Chargers take that plan a step further with Jordan Davis at pick No.
Georgia defensive tackle Jordan Davis has earned rave reviews from across the country, widely considered the best prospect at the position and one of the best prospects in general heading into the draft.
Along with right tackle, linebacker, and (possibly) wide receiver, defensive tackle presents a bit of a need for the 2022 Chargers.
Though briefly held on this play, Davis moves through the line like an ox.
Because of Davis' size and game-wrecking play, he's often double blocked, which can free up space for his teammates to unleash havoc.

     Summary: UPDATE: This article was published on the morning of the 2022 NFL Draft, before the Eagles selected Jordan Davis.
With the NFL Draft upon us, Jordan Davis, Georgia’s mammoth 6-foot-6, 341-pound defensive tackle, and the Philadelphia Eagles keep intersecting on many mock draft boards.
Both Smith and Walker feel there may be no better fit for Davis than the Eagles.
He’s going to be better and can be developed into being a productive pass rusher.
He’s going to be tasked to run 10 yards, and he can do that with great explosion.
