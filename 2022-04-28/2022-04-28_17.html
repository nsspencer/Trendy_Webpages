     Halyna Hutchins Death Video Still Available From Sheriff, Despite Husband's Demand
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Sheriff in the "Rust" shooting investigation is apparently telling the widower and son of Halyna Hutchins to pound sand, because the video the Sheriff released showing Halyna slowly dying after being shot is still available for viewing on the official website.
TMZ broke the story, Matthew Hutchins' lawyer, Brian Panish, fired off a blistering email Wednesday to Sheriff Adan Mendoza, demanding he takes down the video footage of Halyna dying on the church floor on the set of "Rust."
But, as of this post, the video was still live on the link provided by the Sheriff.
Play video content TMZ.comHalyna's husband ripped Sheriff Mendoza, saying he trampled the family's dignity and privacy by releasing the footage and other evidence in the "Rust" shooting case.
We've learned the Sheriff hasn't even responded to attorney Panish's demand.

     Halyna Hutchins’ family slams sheriff after ‘Rust’ bodycam footage released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The family of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins is slamming the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office for releasing video of the final moments before her death on the set of "Rust," saying the "damage" the police have done is "irreparable."
A letter from the attorney for the Hutchins family says the sheriff's office "trampled" on husband Matthew Hutchins' "constitutional right" by giving "less than a business day to review the materials" before they were released to the public.
The attorney for the family also called for the Santa Fe Sheriff's Office to take down the video footage of Hutchins dying on the floor of a church on the movie set.
Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza spoke on TODAY Tuesday about why his office released the trove of evidence.
NBC News reached out to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office about the letter from the Hutchins family but did not receive a response.

     Summary: The Santa Fe Sheriff's Department did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.
':New video released of Alec Baldwin moments after 'Rust' shooting: 'Am I being charged?'
Central to Panish's complaint is that the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department offered his client less than a day to review the extensive file of documents.
Data files released Monday by the sheriff's office also included a video of investigators debriefing Baldwin within hours of the fatal shooting.
In another video, Souza is seen in a hospital bed recounting to a deputy officer what he remembers from the shooting.

     Police Dump Of ‘Rust’ Fatal Shooting Probe Files Castigated By Halyna Hutchins’ Estate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The release by police this week of footage of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins dying on set last year after being fatally shot by Alec Baldwin has lawyers for the Hutchins family fuming.
“We also demand that your office take down the video footage of Halyna Hutchins dying on the church floor,” the LA-based lawyer adds.
Your office promised to allow Mr. Hutchins to review the materials being publicly released in advance of their dissemination to the press.
But even this arrangement was violated when your office released the materials to the public before releasing the materials to Mr. Hutchins.
The first time Mr. Hutchins saw the disturbing and unsettling video footage of his dying wife lying on the church floor was on Radar Online, an internet website.
