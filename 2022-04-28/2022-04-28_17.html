     Summary: 9 pick in this year‚Äôs NFL Draft, the Denver Broncos could‚Äôve had any quarterback they wanted; instead they flipped that pick as part of the trade to acquire Russell Wilson.
There were still some intriguing prospects at these positions had the Broncos kept their pick and didn‚Äôt choose a quarterback.
Trent McDuffie, a cornerback from Washington, is also a good guess of what the Broncos could‚Äôve had.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More than a decade after the two suited up in Madison, Wisconsin, Melvin Gordon III and Russell Wilson are reunited in the NFL.
With Wilson landing with the Denver Broncos this offseason, and Gordon deciding to resign in the Mile High City, the Broncos offense will have a distinct Badgers flair.
When Gordon solidified his deal on Wednesday, the Broncos posted a video of the former Badger running back talking about next season and reuniting with a Wisconsin quarterback.
The confidence was there for one of Wisconsin‚Äôs best backs of all time, as he made it clear that this was a team with Super Bowl expectations.
For Gordon and the Broncos, ‚Äúthe sky‚Äôs the limit.‚Äù
