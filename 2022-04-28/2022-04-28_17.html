     Chris Olave drafted by Saints, eager to learn from Michael Thomas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I am going to give the Saints everything I have," – @chrisolave_ 📺: 2022 #NFLDraft on NFLN/ESPN/ABC pic.twitter.com/hLfDOvuy9l — New Orleans Saints (@Saints) April 29, 2022Bang: the New Orleans Saints took action to solve the biggest problem on their roster, moving up a few spots in the first round of the 2022 NFL draft to acquire Ohio State Buckeyes wide receiver Chris Olave.
And if you’re wondering whether Olave knows Saints superstar wideout Michael Thomas through their careers at Ohio State — yeah, there’s something there.
Olave led the loaded Buckeyes offense in receiving yards in 2019 and 2020, also pacing the team in touchdown receptions in 2019 and 2021.
He started games as a freshman and ended his run at Ohio State as the No.
So he should enjoy the benefits of Thomas drawing attention away from him.

     Summary: With the 11th pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the X select Ohio State WR Chris Olave.
Still, he entertained offers from a number of schools, including Tennessee and Oregon State, but chose Ohio State to play for Ryan Day and wide receivers coach Brian Hartline.
During the 2019 campaign, Olave caught 49 passes for 849 yards and 12 touchdowns, averaging 17.3 yards per reception.
Stat to Know: Olave holds the Ohio State school record for career touchdown receptions with 35.
Strengths: The ability to run a “full route tree” is often overblown when it comes to evaluating wide receivers for the draft.
