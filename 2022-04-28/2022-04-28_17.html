     AAPL earnings Q2 2022: Analysts expect strong growth across the board (except iPads)
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AAPL earnings for Q2 2022 (calendar Q1) will be announced by the company later today, and analysts are expecting the news to be good.
While professional analysts are more cautious than independent ones, all expect significant year-on-year growth almost across the board …PED30 has collated a spreadsheet showing the consensus expectations of analysts for total revenue, as well as the anticipated breakdown by product category.
The bottom line is that analysts expect Apple to report total revenue of $95.51B, against $89.58B for the same quarter last year.
Analysts anticipate revenue growth for iPhone, Mac, and wearables (Apple Watch and AirPods).
The only area where they expect revenue to be flat is iPad, the consensus view actually predicting a marginal fall year-on-year.

     Apple shares dip after company warns of a possible $8 billion hit from supply constraints
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Apple shares fell nearly 4% in extended trading after Apple CFO Luca Maestri warned of several challenges in the current quarter, including supply constraints related to Covid-19 that could hurt sales by between $4 billion and $8 billion.
Apple CEO Tim Cook added the company was "not immune" to supply chain challenges.
Here's how Apple did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: EPS: $1.52 vs. $1.43 estimated$1.52 vs. $1.43 estimated Revenue: $97.28 billion vs. $93.89 billion estimated, up 8.59% year over year$97.28 billion vs. $93.89 billion estimated, up 8.59% year over year iPhone revenue: $50.57 billion vs. $47.88 billion estimated, up 5.5% year over year$50.57 billion vs. $47.88 billion estimated, up 5.5% year over year Services revenue: $19.82 billion vs. $19.72 billion estimated, up 17.28% year over year$19.82 billion vs. $19.72 billion estimated, up 17.28% year over year Other Products revenue: $8.81 billion vs. $9.05 billion estimated, up 12.37% year over year$8.81 billion vs. $9.05 billion estimated, up 12.37% year over year Mac revenue: $10.44 billion vs. $9.25 billion estimated, up 14.73% year over year$10.44 billion vs. $9.25 billion estimated, up 14.73% year over year iPad revenue: $7.65 billion vs. $7.14 billion estimated, down 1.92% year over year$7.65 billion vs. $7.14 billion estimated, down 1.92% year over year Gross margin: 43.7% vs. 43.1% estimated Apple did not provide a forecast for the current quarter — the company hasn't provided official revenue guidance since February 2020, citing uncertainty tied to the pandemic.
In addition, Apple said that its board of directors authorized $90 billion in share buybacks, maintaining its pace as the public company that spends the most buying its own shares.
"We had a record level of upgraders during the quarter and we grew switchers, strong double digits," Cook told CNBC's Steve Kovach.

     Apple (AAPL) Q2 Earnings: What to Expect
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Apple, supply chain disruptions and lockdowns in China, its second-largest market, have added to numerous headwinds.
While Apple stock has held relatively well during the selloff (up 11% in six months), shares have fallen 10% from their 52-week high and are down 6% year to date.
The downbeat projected fiscal year-over-year growth for EPS and revenue, and the lack of explosive growth, is one reason Apple stock has struggled.
For the long term, Apple’s revenue growth capability is not in question.
In the first quarter, Apple earned $2.10 per share on $123.95 billion in revenue, beating consensus of $1.89 per share on $118.4 billion in revenue.
