     BREAKING: Carolina Panthers Draft NC State OT Ikem Ekwonu
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Moments ago, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced that the Carolina Panthers have selected North Carolina State offensive lineman Ikem Ekwonu sixth overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft.
Analysis from NFL Draft Bible on Sports Illustrated:Very strong and aggressive guard who has started at tackle.
Ekwonu is a competitive finisher, consistently creating movement in the run game and possessing the footspeed to pass protect on the interior.
Playing with his chest over his toes hurts his balance and he struggles in pass protection on an island.
Ekwonu projects as a starting guard early on in his career who will make a difference as a run blocker.

     Panthers select OT Ikem Ekwonu with 6th overall pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Carolina Panthers were hoping they’d have at least one of the 2022 NFL draft’s top three hog mollies available to them on Thursday night.
Well, they had all three there, so they definitely got their man.
And that man is North Carolina State University offensive lineman Ikem “Ickey” Ekwonu.
Draft Wire analyst Natalie Miller believes he can be that solution, describing the 6-foot-4, 310-pounder as a potential pillar.
“Ekwonu will be highly valued as a versatile offensive lineman with elite traits who can play multiple positions effectively,” Miller writes.

     2022 NFL Draft grades: Panthers pick Ikem Ekwonu at No. 6 overall, bolstering O-line with NC State star
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 6 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, the Carolina Panthers have selected the highly touted offensive tackle out of North Carolina State.
Ekwonu is considered to be arguably the top offensive tackle prospect in this year's draft and was even sitting atop mock drafts as the potential No.
On top of his prowess as a left tackle prospect, the 6-foot-4, 320 pounder also has experience playing guard, giving him even more versatility as he takes this next step in the NFL.
With the Panthers, Ekwonu is poised to raise the ceiling for an offensive line that struggled to protect the quarterback in 2021.
Last season, Carolina's O-line ranked 27th in the NFL in adjusted sack rate and was in the bottom third in the league in efficiency overall.
