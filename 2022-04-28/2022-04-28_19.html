    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: More than a decade after the two suited up in Madison, Wisconsin, Melvin Gordon III and Russell Wilson are reunited in the NFL.
With Wilson landing with the Denver Broncos this offseason, and Gordon deciding to resign in the Mile High City, the Broncos offense will have a distinct Badgers flair.
When Gordon solidified his deal on Wednesday, the Broncos posted a video of the former Badger running back talking about next season and reuniting with a Wisconsin quarterback.
The confidence was there for one of Wisconsin’s best backs of all time, as he made it clear that this was a team with Super Bowl expectations.
For Gordon and the Broncos, “the sky’s the limit.”

There were still some intriguing prospects at these positions had the Broncos kept their pick and didn’t choose a quarterback.
Trent McDuffie, a cornerback from Washington, is also a good guess of what the Broncos could’ve had.

The Broncos didn’t need to further justify the move they made March 8, but the first round of the NFL Draft did it for them.
Or perhaps the Broncos take advantage of other teams that are eager to jump into the second round and move back to collect future picks.
Whatever the landscape, Paton and the Broncos will be eager to make moves to enhance the roster Friday.
