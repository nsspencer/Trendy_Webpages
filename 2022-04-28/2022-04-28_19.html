     Charles Cross goes to Seahawks at No. 9
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Seahawks acquired the ninth overall pick in the 2022 draft when they traded Russell Wilson to Denver earlier this offseason in a move that signaled the end of a successful era of football in Seattle.
They kicked off the next era by selecting Mississippi State tackle Charles Cross with the ninth overall pick in Las Vegas on Thursday night.
He is the third tackle to come off the board in the last four picks.
Cross fills a huge need for the Seahawks with last year’s left tackle Duane Brown unsigned and no obvious choice to fill the position on the roster.
He was a two-year starter at the SEC school and was frequently a mock draft choice for the Seahawks given their need at the position.

     Seahawks draft offensive tackle Charles Cross with the No. 9 pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: RENTON — With their highest draft pick since 2010 the Seattle Seahawks did what they did then — draft a left tackle they hope can hold down the position for years, selecting Charles Cross of Mississippi State.
Okung filled the left tackle spot from 2010-15 before leaving as a free agent, anchoring Seattle’s line in 2013 when the Seahawks own the Super Bowl.
The other two went before Seattle pick — Ikem Ekonwu North Carolina State to Carolina with the sixth pick and Evan Neal of Alabama to the Giants at seven.
SponsoredWrote Pro Football Focus of Cross: “Cross was a former top recruit who was thrown to the fire in a big way when Mike Leach took over in 2020.
The pick Seattle used on Cross was acquired from Seattle as part of the trade of Russell Wilson to Denver.

     Seattle Seahawks select Mississippi State OT Charles Cross with the ninth pick. Grade: A+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the ninth pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the Seattle Seahawks select Mississippi State OT Charles Cross.
And he’s a better run-blocker than you may think, or Pete Carroll wouldn’t touch him with a 2000-mile pole.
Cross had just 22 overall reps and 11 pass-blocking reps in 2019, his first season on the field at Mississippi State, but his involvement in the Bulldogs’ offense took a serious uptick when Mike Leach became the head coach in 2020.
Stat to Know: Cross allowed six sacks and 44 total pressures on 574 pass-blocking reps in his first collegiate starting season of 2020; he knocked that way down to two sacks and 16 pressures allowed on 719 pass-blocking reps in 2021.
Cross’ Mississippi State bookend Scott Lashley ranked second with 680, and Alabama’s Evan Neal ranked third with 650.
