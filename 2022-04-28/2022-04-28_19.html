     Arizona Cardinals acquire Baltimore Ravens WR Marquise Brown for first-round pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: TEMPE, Ariz. -- The Arizona Cardinals traded their first-round pick to the Baltimore Ravens on Thursday in exchange for wide receiver Marquise "Hollywood" Brown and the 100th pick in the draft.
The move reunites Brown and Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, who played together at Oklahoma in 2017 and 2018.
Both players were drafted in 2019, with Murray going first overall to the Cardinals and Brown going 25th overall.
Last season, Brown became the first Baltimore wide receiver to surpass 1,000 yards receiving since Mike Wallace did so five years ago.
So, wide receiver becomes a need for Baltimore.

     Summary: Brown was the Ravens' leading wide receiver last season, hauling in 91 passes for 1,008 yards and six touchdowns.
But Baltimore also used a first-round pick on Rashod Bateman in last year's draft, and he will now be relied upon to take on an even bigger share of the load.
Brown was approaching his fourth NFL season and the Ravens hadn't picked up his fifth-year option yet, although General Manager Eric DeCosta said the expectation was that Baltimore would.
However, the trade market for wide receiver has exploded this offseason and the Ravens had a chance to recoup the first-round pick they used on Brown (No.
The Ravens already paid tight end Mark Andrews and have Lamar Jackson's contract extension still to come at some point.
