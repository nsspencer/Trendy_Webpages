     Jameson Williams: What to know about the Detroit Lions' new 'game-changer'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Detroit Lions made one of the biggest trades of the first round, moving up 20 spots to draft stand out wide receiver Jameson Willams from Alabama.
He bet on himselfJameson Williams was a part of one of the most loaded wide receiver squads in NCAA history at Ohio State.
But the Lions' move into the top 12 picks was a long-term play, and Williams told NFL Network's Ian Rappaport he is healing ahead of schedule.
Williams he could play on special teams as well for Detroit.
He returned two kicks for scores at Alabama but also was ejected for targeting on special teams play against rival Auburn in November.

     Detroit Lions select Alabama WR Jameson Williams with the 12th pick. Grade: A+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the 12th pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the Detroit Lions select Jameson Williams, WR, Alabama.
He caught 68 passes for 1,626 yards and 22 touchdowns as a senior, and was named an Under Armour All-American for his achievements.
Williams was an immediate impact player for the Crimson Tide in 2021, catching 79 passes for 1,572 yards and 15 touchdowns.
One of the things that Williams does extremely well is transition immediately from receiver to athlete after the catch.
Conclusion: Williams is a scheme-diverse receiver who can win early in the down, late in the down, and everywhere in the middle.

     2022 NFL Draft Day Notes: Possible Trades, Jameson Williams Rising
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three positions have stood out—corner, pass rusher and receiver.
Pass rusher: Michigan’s Aidan Hutchinson, Georgia’s Travon Walker, Oregon’s Kayvon Thibodeaux and Florida State’s Jermaine Johnson II constitute the first group.
I could see Philly moving up into the middle of the top 10, maybe for a corner, maybe for a pass rusher, maybe for a receiver.
It’s true that many of his splash plays are in chase-down situations and that he was more consistent as a pass rusher from the inside than the outside.
It’s also true, per NFL folks, that he needs to develop moves as a pass rusher if he’s going to be a dominant edge guy.

     A CLOSER LOOK: Wide receiver Jameson Williams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a high school junior, he had 36 catches for 1,069 yards, 15 TDs and an average of 29.5 yards per catch.
He was also a star in track and field, as a sprinter and long jumper.
Williams entered the transfer portal after seeing little action in his first two seasons at Ohio State.
He was an instant star on a Crimson Tide team that annually has its players drafted in the first round.
Many analysts say he would have been a Top 5 pick had it not been for the knee injury sustained in the national championship game.
