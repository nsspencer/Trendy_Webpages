     Jameson Williams on potentially playing with Patrick Mahomes: 'We probably could be the greatest duo ever'
    </h2>

     Summary: Jameson Williams is expected to be an impact wide receiver in this draft, no matter where he ends up.
The Kansas City Chiefs, who have picks No.
If Williams does end up in Kansas City, he certainly wouldn't mind playing with Patrick Mahomes to start his career.
Adding that big-play receiver is what Kansas City needs to complete the revamp.
Williams could be the player who helps keep the Chiefs' high-octane offense the most explosive in the AFC.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama football's Jameson Williams was selected by the Detroit Lions in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft.
His selection marks the third consecutive year in which Alabama has had at least one receiver picked in the first round of the draft.
Williams transferred to Alabama in 2021 after two underwhelming seasons with Ohio State in a crowded receiver room.

     Why Jameson Williams is Worth the Kansas City Chiefs Trading up
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the loss of Tyreek Hill and the availability of two late first round picks, there's good reason for the Kansas City Chiefs to trade up and attempt to land Jameson Williams.
This trade has put them in a situation to now have the 28th and 29th picks for this year's NFL Draft.
The Chiefs might only be able to move to some place between 10-15 in the NFL Draft, but that should honestly work out well.
Indeed, even with Williams competing at the NFL Combine, the Chiefs would do quite well to land him because of his overall speed and athleticism.
Let’s see what the Chiefs decide to do, but there’s good value in Kansas City moving up in the 2022 NFL Draft.

     Detroit Lions select Alabama WR Jameson Williams with the 12th pick. Grade: A+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the 12th pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the Detroit Lions select Jameson Williams, WR, Alabama.
He caught 68 passes for 1,626 yards and 22 touchdowns as a senior, and was named an Under Armour All-American for his achievements.
Williams was an immediate impact player for the Crimson Tide in 2021, catching 79 passes for 1,572 yards and 15 touchdowns.
One of the things that Williams does extremely well is transition immediately from receiver to athlete after the catch.
Conclusion: Williams is a scheme-diverse receiver who can win early in the down, late in the down, and everywhere in the middle.

     2022 NFL Draft Day Notes: Possible Trades, Jameson Williams Rising
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three positions have stood out—corner, pass rusher and receiver.
Pass rusher: Michigan’s Aidan Hutchinson, Georgia’s Travon Walker, Oregon’s Kayvon Thibodeaux and Florida State’s Jermaine Johnson II constitute the first group.
I could see Philly moving up into the middle of the top 10, maybe for a corner, maybe for a pass rusher, maybe for a receiver.
It’s true that many of his splash plays are in chase-down situations and that he was more consistent as a pass rusher from the inside than the outside.
It’s also true, per NFL folks, that he needs to develop moves as a pass rusher if he’s going to be a dominant edge guy.
