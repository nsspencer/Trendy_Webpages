     How Much Money Has Amber Heard Paid to the ACLU?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The chief operating officer of the ACLU testified on Thursday that Amber Heard, Johnny Depp's ex-wife, has only paid $1.3 million of the $3.5 million she has pledged to donate to the organization.
During the testimony, ACLU Chief Operating Officer Terence Dougherty said that the ACLU received donations of $350,000, $500,000 and $350,000 that were all "associated" with Heard.
A $350,000 donation that was paid in August 2016 came directly from Heard, according to Dougherty.
Heard hasn't donated anything to ACLU since 2019 and she didn't sign a pledge form that ACLU prepared for her, according to Dougherty.
Heard's last donation to the organization was in December 2018 when she paid $350,000 from the donor-advised fund of Fidelity.

     Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial: ACLU Believes Elon Musk Was Behind $500,000 Donation Toward Actress’s Pledge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The general counsel of the ACLU testified Thursday in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial in Virginia that the foundation believed billionaire Elon Musk was behind a $500,000 payment to help the actress fulfill a $3.5 million donation pledge to the organization.
Heard had said she would donate $7 million from her divorce settlement with Depp to charity, split between the ACLU and Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.
But in Depp’s $50 million defamation claim against Heard, his attorneys have been trying to show that Heard has not followed through on the pledge to the ACLU.
Dougherty said that the Musk payment was believed to have been made via a Vanguard fund set up to make charitable contributions.
Heard made a direct payment in August 2016 of $350,000, $500,000 in 2017 and $350,000 from a Vanguard fund in 2018.

     Court told Amber Heard only gave ACLU half of promised $3.5m donation from Johnny Depp divorce settlement

     Summary: Amber Heard only gave ACLU half of the promised $3.5m donation from her $7m divorce settlement from Johnny Depp, a court was told.
While Mr Depp isn’t named in the piece, his legal team argues that it contains a “clear implication that Mr Depp is a domestic abuser”, which they say is “categorically and demonstrably false”.
The ACLU spoke to Ms Heard when Mr Depp sent a cheque to the organisation on her behalf.
“Why was Mr Musk representing this on behalf of Ms Heard?” Mr Dougherty was asked.
He said he didn’t know but he assumed it was because Mr Musk was familiar with Mr Romero.

     ACLU Says Amber Heard Donated Way Less Than Her $3.5 Million Pledge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Has Donated Way Less Than $3.5 Mil Pledge, So FarAmber Heard is getting called out in court for allegedly failing to follow through on a huge donation to charity -- the ACLU says she gave them less than half of her $3.5 million pledge -- though she's still got a few years left to fulfill that promise.
Amber's pledge was revisited Thursday in Depp's defamation trial against Heard ... with ACLU honcho Terence Dougherty saying the non-profit received 4 donations in Amber's name, totaling only $1.3 million.
Play video contentWhat's more, Dougherty says Amber only gave the ACLU $350k directly, while Depp wrote them a check for $100k.
The ACLU says the other payments included $500k from a donor-advised fund at Vanguard and $350k from a donor-advised fund at Fidelity.
Dougherty said Elon emailed the ACLU's executive director, Anthony Romero, back in 2016 indicating Amber would donate the $3.5 million over 10 years, but he says 2019 was the last year the ACLU got a donation from Heard.

     ACLU Believes Elon Musk Paid $500,000 In Charity Donations In Amber Heard's Name

     Summary: Following the couple's divorce, Heard vowed to donate her $7 million settlement to both the ACLU and Children's Hospital Los Angeles.
During his testimony with Depp's team, Dougherty broke down the payments made to the ACLU, as of the date of his deposition in December 2021.
Dougherty said the ACLU hasn't received any donations since December 2018 and when they reached out to her about her donations in 2019, they learned she was having "financial difficulties."
Dougherty added they didn't "force" her to talk about her own experience, but left that up to her own discretion.
That being said, he also confirmed he had no indication that Heard didn't intend to complete her donations at some point.

     ACLU Says Amber Heard’s Domestic Violence Op-Ed Aimed to Capitalize on ‘Aquaman’ Press
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The general counsel of the ACLU testified on Thursday that Amber Heard’s op-ed in the Washington Post about domestic violence was timed to capitalize on the release of “Aquaman.”The op-ed alluded to Heard’s allegations against ex-husband Johnny Depp, though Depp was not named.
“The goal is to get this out this week to capitalize on the tremendous campaign for ‘Aquaman,'” Weitz wrote.
“From the ACLU’s perspective, Amber is about to receive an incredible amount of press and be in the public eye,” Dougherty said.
Heard’s lawyers have stressed that she followed her attorneys’ advice in the drafting of the op-ed.
Dougherty said that the ACLU learned in 2019 that Heard was having financial problems and could not fulfill the remainder of the pledge.
