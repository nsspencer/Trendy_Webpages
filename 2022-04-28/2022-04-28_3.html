     Deutsche Bank whistleblower linked to Trump probe found dead
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A whistleblower who was involved in an investigation into Donald Trump's business deals with Deutsche Bank was found dead in Los Angeles on Monday.
Broeksmit "supplied me and other journalists with Deutsche Bank documents that highlighted the bank's deep Russia connections," Stedman said.
Broeksmit's father was an executive at Deutsche Bank before taking his own life.
Broeksmit's documents reportedly gave investigators access to materials "only people within the inner circle of Deutsche would ever see."
Trump's past relationship with Deutsche Bank was heavily detailed by New York Times reporter David Enrich, who directly worked with Broeksmit for his 2020 book "Dark Towers: Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump, and an Epic Trail of Destruction."
