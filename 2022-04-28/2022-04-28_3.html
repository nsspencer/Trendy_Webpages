     Steelers are a perfect situation for Kenny Pickett
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is, at least, the philosophy by which the Steelers selected Kenny Pickett on Thursday.
20, its original pick, Pittsburgh simply waited as a handful of quarterback-needy teams entertained and passed potential fits.
The Steelers are one of those teams, and they understand that the plan is never to pick in the top 10.
Despite a somewhat frantic presence in the pocket, Pickett is a timely and accurate passer with the kind of pocket mobility the Steelers never have enjoyed in the Mike Tomlin regime.
Of course, we could be saying a lot of this no matter who the Steelers took in the 2022 draft.

     Summary: How could the Steelers have possibly pass on the guy who shattered Dan Marino’s passing records, 39 years after failing to draft Marino.
It was really special,” Pickett said.
This was Kenny Pickett's future.
In the days leading up to the draft, projections of where Pickett would be taken yo-yoed wildly, from the Carolina Panthers at No.
Pickett will be the third Ocean player to take the field in the NFL, joining Oakland Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano, a Super Bowl champion, and Buffalo punter John Nies.

     Summary: With Pittsburgh quarterback Kenny Pickett there for the taking Thursday night, the Steelers selected him with the 20th overall pick.
In the process, Pickett becomes the first Panthers quarterback since Marino to be selected in the first round of the NFL Draft.
His 42 touchdown passes broke Marino's single-season school record of 37 touchdown passes set during the 1981 season.
Pickett also reached 81 career touchdown passes, breaking Marino's career mark of 79 touchdown passes from 1979-82.
During his final season at Pitt, Pickett also threw for a school record 4,319 yards while completing 67.2% of his passes.

     QB Kenny Pickett stays in Pittsburgh, picked by Steelers in 2022 NFL draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PITTSBURGH -- For months, the Pittsburgh Steelers searched across the country for Ben Roethlisberger's successor.
20 pick in the NFL draft, the Steelers selected Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett on Thursday night, making him Roethlisberger's heir apparent and the only quarterback selected in the first round.
And, by selecting Pickett, the Steelers avoid potentially making a Dan Marino-like mistake, when they passed on the fellow Panther in the 1983 NFL draft.
"We're super, super excited to be able to draft Kenny Pickett with our first-round pick," Colbert said.
Exciting times for us, for Kenny, for the University of Pittsburgh, and for Pittsburgh in general.

     Summary: Pickett initially committed to Temple as a three-star recruit coming out of high school but eventually wound up at Pitt.
Pickett led Pitt to the ACC Championship in 2021 when he threw for 4,319 yards and 42 touchdowns and was intercepted just seven times.
"I had three average years, in my opinion, and then a solid season," Pickett assessed during an interview with the NFL Network at the Senior Bowl.

     Pittsburgh Steelers select Pitt QB Kenny Pickett with the 20th pick. Grade: B
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the 20th pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the Pittsburgh Steelers select Pitt QB Kenny Pickett.
The Steelers needed to hit it down the fairway with their quarterback search ,and Mitch Trubisky wasn’t going to do it.
Pickett is that solid double — the most pro-ready quarterback in this class, and a prospect with some upside.
The Steelers, who are a quarterback away from doing something special in the postseason, went with the safer bet.
Pickett is an accurate passer who throws with touch, rhythm and anticipation, things that still matter at the position.
