     How Much Money Has Amber Heard Paid to the ACLU?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The chief operating officer of the ACLU testified on Thursday that Amber Heard, Johnny Depp's ex-wife, has only paid $1.3 million of the $3.5 million she has pledged to donate to the organization.
During the testimony, ACLU Chief Operating Officer Terence Dougherty said that the ACLU received donations of $350,000, $500,000 and $350,000 that were all "associated" with Heard.
A $350,000 donation that was paid in August 2016 came directly from Heard, according to Dougherty.
Heard hasn't donated anything to ACLU since 2019 and she didn't sign a pledge form that ACLU prepared for her, according to Dougherty.
Heard's last donation to the organization was in December 2018 when she paid $350,000 from the donor-advised fund of Fidelity.

     Elon Musk chipped in for Amber Heard’s ACLU donation: Depp trial testimony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Billionaire Elon Musk appears to have chipped in at least $500,000 to ex-girlfriend Amber Heard’s donation to the American Civil Liberties Union, the organization’s general counsel testified Thursday.
The rest of the $1.3 million the ACLU eventually came from Depp, who forked over $100,000, and a donor Dougherty believes was Musk.
That money included a $500,000 donation from a fund at Vanguard and $350,000 from a Fidelity fund, Dougherty testified.
A letter to Heard regarding her $350,000 donation was provided during the trial.
ReutersTerence Dougherty testified that Heard only paid $350,000 of the $3.5 million pledge to the ACLU.

     ACLU: Files complaint alleging pervasive discrimination in Oshkosh Area School District
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MILWAUKEE — The ACLU of Wisconsin filed a complaint earlier this week with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights asking them to investigate the Oshkosh Area School District after Black middle school students were expelled when they were racially harassed at school.
TreVon says he has experienced racially disparate punishment at Oshkosh Area School District schools since he was in Kindergarten, sometimes for minor things such as putting his head on his desk.
Seven Black students were ultimately referred for expulsion as a result of the events at the dance.
The complaint alleges that the District did not investigate the racial harassment that TreVon and Karizmah endured.
Additionally, at TreVon’s expulsion hearing, the school board official overseeing the hearing said that the racial harassment that occurred was ‘not relevant’ to TreVon’s expulsion.

     Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial: ACLU Believes Elon Musk Was Behind $500,000 Donation Toward Actress’s Pledge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The general counsel of the ACLU testified Thursday in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial in Virginia that the foundation believed billionaire Elon Musk was behind a $500,000 payment to help the actress fulfill a $3.5 million donation pledge to the organization.
Heard had said she would donate $7 million from her divorce settlement with Depp to charity, split between the ACLU and Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.
But in Depp’s $50 million defamation claim against Heard, his attorneys have been trying to show that Heard has not followed through on the pledge to the ACLU.
Dougherty said that the Musk payment was believed to have been made via a Vanguard fund set up to make charitable contributions.
Heard made a direct payment in August 2016 of $350,000, $500,000 in 2017 and $350,000 from a Vanguard fund in 2018.

     ACLU Says Amber Heard’s Domestic Violence Op-Ed Aimed to Capitalize on ‘Aquaman’ Press
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The general counsel of the ACLU testified on Thursday that Amber Heard’s op-ed in the Washington Post about domestic violence was timed to capitalize on the release of “Aquaman.”The op-ed alluded to Heard’s allegations against ex-husband Johnny Depp, though Depp was not named.
“The goal is to get this out this week to capitalize on the tremendous campaign for ‘Aquaman,'” Weitz wrote.
“From the ACLU’s perspective, Amber is about to receive an incredible amount of press and be in the public eye,” Dougherty said.
Heard’s lawyers have stressed that she followed her attorneys’ advice in the drafting of the op-ed.
Dougherty said that the ACLU learned in 2019 that Heard was having financial problems and could not fulfill the remainder of the pledge.

     ACLU Says Amber Heard Donated Way Less Than Her $3.5 Million Pledge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Has Donated Way Less Than $3.5 Mil Pledge, So FarAmber Heard is getting called out in court for allegedly failing to follow through on a huge donation to charity -- the ACLU says she gave them less than half of her $3.5 million pledge -- though she's still got a few years left to fulfill that promise.
Amber's pledge was revisited Thursday in Depp's defamation trial against Heard ... with ACLU honcho Terence Dougherty saying the non-profit received 4 donations in Amber's name, totaling only $1.3 million.
Play video contentWhat's more, Dougherty says Amber only gave the ACLU $350k directly, while Depp wrote them a check for $100k.
The ACLU says the other payments included $500k from a donor-advised fund at Vanguard and $350k from a donor-advised fund at Fidelity.
Dougherty said Elon emailed the ACLU's executive director, Anthony Romero, back in 2016 indicating Amber would donate the $3.5 million over 10 years, but he says 2019 was the last year the ACLU got a donation from Heard.

Dougherty believes the $500,000 payment came from a fund linked to Musk, who Heard dated briefly after her marriage to Depp ended.
In 2019, when the ACLU expected another donation installment from Heard, “we learned that she was having financial difficulties,” Dougherty said.

     What Happened to Amber Heard’s ACLU Donations?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While this might seem granular, Heard’s alleged handling of this donation is key to Depp’s trial strategy.
Depp has contended that Heard’s abuse allegations and the sympathy they generated were a ploy for publicity.
By discussing Heard’s relationship with the ACLU — and suggesting she wasn’t forthcoming about her planned donations — he’s trying to undermine her credibility.
(Heard dated Musk after her split with Depp, though Musk was “just filling space,” according to testimony on April 27.)
Dougherty’s testimony also indicated that Heard’s op-ed was penned in close collaboration with ACLU staff.
