     Giants take Evan Neal at No. 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesAfter selecting one of the best pass rushers in the 2022 NFL draft, the Giants have now also drafted one of the best pass blockers.
Alabama offensive tackle Evan Neal has gone to the Giants with the seventh overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft.
This was the Giants’ second pick tonight; they took Kayvon Thibodeaux with the fifth overall pick.
The Giants decided not to pick up the fifth-year option on quarterback Daniel Jones, so it’s unclear how much of a future Jones has in New York.
But the Giants think they have a franchise tackle, even if they don’t have a franchise quarterback.

Joe Schoen also made it clear he wanted to fix the offensive line and one of his goals was to build through the draft.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama star offensive tackle Evan Neal is coming to Big Blue with the seventh pick in the NFL Draft.
He should slot in at right tackle, and at 6-foot-7 and 337 pounds, Neal is the ideal bookend to Andrew Thomas.
Big Blue had its pick of offensive linemen, and Neal was the choice.
He dominated as a left tackle in his final season in college, but also has experience playing right tackle last season and the year before he played left guard.
He possesses the physical measurables NFL scouts seek in an offensive tackle, and his tape matches those numbers.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Evan Neal, a mammoth 6-foot-7, 335-pounder who has played both tackle positions at Alabama, is the second opening-round pick by the Giants.
He’s likely to fit right in with a line that has been a weakness in New York for years.
Neal improved throughout his stay with the Crimson Tide, and his explosion off the snap is exemplary.
