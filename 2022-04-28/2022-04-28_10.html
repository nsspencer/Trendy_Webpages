Johnson was projected as a top-10 pick, possibly by the Jets.

     New York Jets select Florida State EDGE Jermaine Johnson II with the 26th pick. Grade: A+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the X pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the New York Jets select Florida State EDGE Jermaine Johnson II.
The Jets got out of the first round with three picks: Sauce Gardner, Garrett Wilson, and Johnson.
Strengths: In today’s front-versatile NFL, you want an edge defender who has some game inside the tackles, and Johnson qualifies.
Johnson doesn’t get to the quarterback, but here’s where you can see how he uses his hands as an inside rusher.
Based on the tape and attributes, I’d say he’s there already.
