     Gwen Shamblin: 5 Things To Know About Christian Diet Founder Featured In HBO’s ‘The Way Down’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As The Way Down comes to a close, here’s everything you need to know about the controversial and fascinating life of Gwen Shamblin.
Gwen became famous for her religious-based weight loss program, Weigh Down Workshop.
Gwen, who was raised in a Church of Christ family, founded the Remnant Fellowship Church in Brentwood, Tennessee in 1999.
In a statement issued after the first episodes came out, Remnant Fellowship said it “categorically denies the absurd, defamatory statements and accusations” made in the doc, referring to it as “yet another Hollywood attack on religion.” Remnant Fellowship is now run by Gwen’s children, Elizabeth Shamblin and Michael Shamblin.
Gwen got a divorce from David — which many church members viewed as hypocritical — in order to marry Joe in 2018.
