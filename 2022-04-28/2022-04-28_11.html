     Giants take Evan Neal at No. 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesAfter selecting one of the best pass rushers in the 2022 NFL draft, the Giants have now also drafted one of the best pass blockers.
Alabama offensive tackle Evan Neal has gone to the Giants with the seventh overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft.
This was the Giants’ second pick tonight; they took Kayvon Thibodeaux with the fifth overall pick.
The Giants decided not to pick up the fifth-year option on quarterback Daniel Jones, so it’s unclear how much of a future Jones has in New York.
But the Giants think they have a franchise tackle, even if they don’t have a franchise quarterback.

     NY Giants snag Evan Neal with No. 7 pick, second first-rounder in 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama star offensive tackle Evan Neal is coming to Big Blue with the seventh pick in the NFL Draft.
He should slot in at right tackle, and at 6-foot-7 and 337 pounds, Neal is the ideal bookend to Andrew Thomas.
Big Blue had its pick of offensive linemen, and Neal was the choice.
He dominated as a left tackle in his final season in college, but also has experience playing right tackle last season and the year before he played left guard.
He possesses the physical measurables NFL scouts seek in an offensive tackle, and his tape matches those numbers.

     Summary: Alabama offensive tackle Evan Neal was the first Crimson Tide athlete off the board at Thursday night's first round of the NFL Draft.
Throughout his three years at Alabama, Neal quickly became not only one of the most dependable offensive linemen in recent memory but also one of its most versatile.
In his third and final season, the 6-foot-7, 337-pound lineman was the Crimson Tide's starter at left tackle.
However, the Alabama tackle should fit in nicely in his new home.
