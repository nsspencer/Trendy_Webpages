     Summary: Getty ImagesLiberty quarterback Malik Willis may be the best quarterback in the 2022 NFL draft, but unlike previous years, there‚Äôs no talk of a quarterback going first overall.
In fact, Liberty coach Hugh Freeze said on NFL Network this morning that he has no idea where Willis will go.
‚ÄúI usually have an idea, but I have no clue on what‚Äôs really going to happen tonight,‚Äù Freeze said.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a question in my mind,‚Äù Freeze said when asked if Willis can start as a rookie.
‚ÄúI also believe he can handle being the backup if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for that organization.

     Summary: On what could be a big night for Liberty‚Äôs Malik Willis, he had some fun with the NFL Network‚Äôs Twitter mistake (which happens sometimes!).
The Twitter account captured the quarterback at the NFL Draft getting a sweet look from a woman by his side.
But then Willis jumped on Twitter to say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my grandma‚Äù with a couple of cry-laughing emojis to indicate no hard feelings.
I love it almost as much as Willis‚Äôs response: ‚ÄúOops.

     For Seahawks, Could Malik Willis Be Next Russell Wilson?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With loud tools across the board, Liberty quarterback Malik Willis may have the highest ceiling of the 2022 quarterback prospects.
In his latest video breakdown, Matty F. Brown analyzes Willis' game and his potential fit with the Seahawks.
Quarterback Malik Willis proved a divisive evaluation in the 2022 NFL Draft.
It is spooky how Willis' positives and negatives share so many similarities with Russell Wilson, whose recent departure has left the Seahawks without a franchise quarterback for the first time since 2012.
By no means are Willis and Wilson the same player; Wilson was far more complete as a prospect coming out.

     Summary: In 2013, there was a weak quarterback class for the NFL draft.
NFL teams didn't push quarterbacks into the first round just to do it.
The 2022 quarterback class will hopefully have better success than that 2013 class, but it was a similar story on Thursday night.
Only one quarterback, Pitt's Kenny Pickett, went in the first round.
But NFL teams weren't impressed, at least not enough to take more than one in the first round on Thursday.
