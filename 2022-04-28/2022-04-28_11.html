     2022 NFL Draft: Patriots select guard Cole Strange with 29th pick
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The New England Patriots have addressed the interior offensive line with their first-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft.
After trading away the 21st overall pick to the Kansas City Chiefs, the Pats selected guard Cole Strange at No.
— Phil Perry (@PhilAPerry) April 29, 2022Here's what Perry wrote about Strange in his Prototypical Patriots series:Strange may not hail from the SEC, but he moves like maybe he should've been recruited there.
He played both left guard and left tackle last season, and during the build up to the draft, he's also worked out at center.
Strange, a 6-foot-6, 300-pounder, fills a void at the guard position left by the departures of Ted Karras and Shaq Mason.

     Twitter reacts to the Patriots drafting Cole Strange in Round 1
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Many on Twitter had strong reactions to Bill Belichick predictably trading the Patriots’ 21st overall pick in the first round of the NFL Draft.
Likewise, Twitter had plenty of hot takes after their selection at pick No.
With the 29th overall pick, New England selected Chattanooga guard Cole Strange.
Strange fills a positional need for the Patriots, who lost guards Ted Karras (free agency) and Shaq Mason (trade) in the offseason.
Although many draft analysts loved the value that New England got from the Chiefs for trading down eight picks, some on Twitter had more to say about Bill Belichick’s first-round selection.

Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-USA TODAY SportsEverything was lined up perfectly for Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots at Pick No.
An overload of defenders were slipping, giving the guru the pick of the litter at the tail end of the first-round.
With Belichick’s 84th draft day deal, the Patriots nabbed two of the assets the Chiefs collected in the Tyreek Hill trade and waited until pick No.
