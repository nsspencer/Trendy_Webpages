     Summary: ESPN anchor Sage Steele is suing the network after claiming it curtailed her right to free speech over remarks she made last year.
Steele attracted criticism after remarks she made on a podcast hosted by former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler last September.
And my white family loves me as much as my Black family.”Former ESPN journalist Jemele Hill was among those who attacked Steele for the remarks, calling her a “clown”.
In a statement to the Journal on Wednesday, ESPN pointed to recent prominent roles assigned to Steele.
“Sage remains a valued contributor on some of ESPN’s highest profile content, including the recent Masters telecasts and anchoring our noon SportsCenter,” the network said.

     ESPN anchor Sage Steele files lawsuit against network, alleges violation of free-speech rights
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Longtime ESPN anchor Sage Steele filed a lawsuit against the network and parent company Disney on Thursday, alleging they violated her free-speech rights by sidelining her last year following critical comments she made on a podcast.
Steele said on Cutler's podcast that she received a COVID-19 vaccine only because it was required by ESPN.
Steele alleges in the lawsuit that she only received the opportunity to co-host ESPN's Masters Coverage after she lodged a complaint with the network's human resources department in February 2022.
The lawsuit also attempts to draw a comparison between ESPN's treatment of Steele and other colleagues who violated network policy but were not punished.
Steele seeks unspecified damages, according to the lawsuit, in which she also claims that ESPN breached her contract.
