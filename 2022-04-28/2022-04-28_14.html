     New Orleans Saints trade up to No. 11, bolster receiving corps by selecting Ohio State's Chris Olave
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: -- The New Orleans Saints, fittingly, became the first team to trade up in this year's NFL draft by moving up from No.
11 to select Ohio State wide receiver Chris Olave on Thursday.
Receiver was a glaring need for the Saints after they finished 32nd in the NFL in passing offense last year.
While Washington really liked Olave, it was comfortable trading back to select Penn State receiver Jahan Dotson.
But Washington has long liked Dotson, always placing him among their top four receiver targets in the first round.

     Chris Olave drafted by Saints, eager to learn from Michael Thomas
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "I am going to give the Saints everything I have," – @chrisolave_ 📺: 2022 #NFLDraft on NFLN/ESPN/ABC pic.twitter.com/hLfDOvuy9l — New Orleans Saints (@Saints) April 29, 2022Bang: the New Orleans Saints took action to solve the biggest problem on their roster, moving up a few spots in the first round of the 2022 NFL draft to acquire Ohio State Buckeyes wide receiver Chris Olave.
And if you’re wondering whether Olave knows Saints superstar wideout Michael Thomas through their careers at Ohio State — yeah, there’s something there.
Olave led the loaded Buckeyes offense in receiving yards in 2019 and 2020, also pacing the team in touchdown receptions in 2019 and 2021.
He started games as a freshman and ended his run at Ohio State as the No.
So he should enjoy the benefits of Thomas drawing attention away from him.

16, 98 and 120 picks in the 2022 NFL Draft in exchange for the No.
New Orleans wasn't done adding to its offense with Olave as it later drafted offensive tackle Trevor Penning at No.
Thomas, a fellow former Buckeye, had a feeling he'd be welcoming another Ohio State product to the Big Easy.
A 6-foot-7, 325-pounder who was an AP FCS All-American as a senior, Penning was NFL Network draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah's No.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the 11th pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the X select Ohio State WR Chris Olave.
Still, he entertained offers from a number of schools, including Tennessee and Oregon State, but chose Ohio State to play for Ryan Day and wide receivers coach Brian Hartline.
During the 2019 campaign, Olave caught 49 passes for 849 yards and 12 touchdowns, averaging 17.3 yards per reception.
Stat to Know: Olave holds the Ohio State school record for career touchdown receptions with 35.
Strengths: The ability to run a “full route tree” is often overblown when it comes to evaluating wide receivers for the draft.
