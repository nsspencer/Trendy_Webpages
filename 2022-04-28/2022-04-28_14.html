     Summary: Seemingly under the assumption that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, the Las Vegas Raiders may be willing to gamble on signing Colin Kaepernick.
On Wednesday, team owner Mark Davis offered support to the quarterback who hasn‚Äôt taken an NFL snap since 2016.
"I believe in Colin Kaepernick," Davis said via NBC Sports Bay Area.
Kaepernick likely prefers Davis kneel by that statement instead.

‚ÄúListen, I believe in Colin Kaepernick, and he deserves every chance in the world to become a quarterback in the National Football League,‚Äù Davis told host Monte Poole.
To this point, Davis is the only owner to express an interest in Kaepernick since rumors of a possible return began circulating in recent weeks.

     Summary: ‚ÄúI believe in Colin Kaepernick,‚Äù said Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis last night in an interview with NBC Sports Bay Area.
Kaepernick has since said he‚Äôd be willing to become a backup quarterback in the league, but remains unsigned.
The Raiders have potential backup candidates in Nick Mullens and Garrett Gilbert, each of whom has less experience than Kaepernick.
According to Davis, any decision on the former 49ers starter will fall to the Raiders‚Äô new GM and its new head coach, Josh McDaniels.
He‚Äôs got a message for society as a whole.‚ÄùDavis compared Kaepernick to Tommie Smith, whom he called a friend.

     Summary: Mark Davis says that he would welcome Colin Kaepernick to the Las Vegas Raiders "with open arms."
‚ÄúI believe in Colin Kaepernick,‚Äù Davis said, per Monte Poole of NBC Sports Bay Area.
While Davis says he's open to Kaepernick joining the Raiders, he left the call with general manager Dave Ziegler and head coach Josh McDaniels.
Kaepernick played five-plus seasons with the 49ers, starting 58 of the 69 games he played in while leading the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance in 2013.
Gilbert, 30, has seen limited action in his four-season NFL career, starting in two of the eight games he's played in for four different teams.
