     Giants take Evan Neal at No. 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesAfter selecting one of the best pass rushers in the 2022 NFL draft, the Giants have now also drafted one of the best pass blockers.
Alabama offensive tackle Evan Neal has gone to the Giants with the seventh overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft.
This was the Giants’ second pick tonight; they took Kayvon Thibodeaux with the fifth overall pick.
The Giants decided not to pick up the fifth-year option on quarterback Daniel Jones, so it’s unclear how much of a future Jones has in New York.
But the Giants think they have a franchise tackle, even if they don’t have a franchise quarterback.

     2022 NFL Draft grades: Giants pick Alabama's Evan Neal at No. 7 overall, beefing up offensive line
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A year after helping Alabama win the national championship, 6-foot-7, 337-pound offensive tackle Evan Neal has landed with the Giants, going No.
He also came out of IMG Academy as one of the top 10 recruits in the country, going on to start at right guard, right tackle and left tackle for Alabama.
An SEC All-Freshman honoree in 2019 while playing on the interior, he was voted a team captain during his final college season, at left tackle.
Now, Neal will be charged with protecting quarterback Daniel Jones, presumably as the Giants' starting right tackle in 2022.
He will step in at right tackle and give them a nice pair of bookends with Andrew Thomas.

     New York Giants land Kayvon Thibodeaux at No. 5 overall pick, Evan Neal at No. 7 in NFL draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mina Kimes explains why the Giants got the steal of the draft by selecting Oregon defensive end Kayvon Thibodeaux.
One of the top prospects entering this past season, Thibodeaux had seven sacks despite playing with an ankle injury in 2021.
Neal also brings tremendous versatility to the Giants, having played a season each at guard, right tackle and left tackle.
That gives the Giants options with 2020 fourth overall pick Andrew Thomas showing major improvement last season at left tackle.
It's likely that Neal begins his Giants career at right tackle.

     Summary: 7 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, the New York Giants have selected University of Alabama offensive tackle Evan Neal.
Neal, who was one of the top overall prospects and arguably the best pick the Giants could hope for at pick No.
#, fills a need on the offensive line immediately and will hopefully be a piece for Big Blue to build around.
Joe Schoen also made it clear he wanted to fix the offensive line and one of his goals was to build through the draft.
Improvement along the offensive line was imperative in order for the Giants to begin moving things in the right direction.

     Evan Neal First Alabama Player Selected at 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama offensive tackle Evan Neal was the first Crimson Tide athlete off the board at Thursday night's first round of the NFL Draft.
Throughout his three years at Alabama, Neal quickly became not only one of the most dependable offensive linemen in recent memory but also one of its most versatile.
In his third and final season, the 6-foot-7, 337-pound lineman was the Crimson Tide's starter at left tackle.
However, the Alabama tackle should fit in nicely in his new home.
Here's a full evaluation of Neal, courtesy of NFL Draft Bible:Evan Neal - Alabama Crimson TideOne-Liners:Huge tackle with special athleticism for his size.

     NY Giants snag Evan Neal with No. 7 pick, second first-rounder in 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama star offensive tackle Evan Neal is coming to Big Blue with the seventh pick in the NFL Draft.
He should slot in at right tackle, and at 6-foot-7 and 337 pounds, Neal is the ideal bookend to Andrew Thomas.
Big Blue had its pick of offensive linemen, and Neal was the choice.
He dominated as a left tackle in his final season in college, but also has experience playing right tackle last season and the year before he played left guard.
He possesses the physical measurables NFL scouts seek in an offensive tackle, and his tape matches those numbers.
