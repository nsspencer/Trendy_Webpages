    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cristiano Ronaldo rescued a point for Manchester United again, as they salvaged a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford.
Marcos Alonso's brilliant volley had put a dominant visiting side ahead on the hour mark, but an instant response from United's talisman helped them avoid another defeat at home.
Chelsea were on top for the majoirty of the evening, with Mason Mount and Reece James combining well throughout.

     Manchester United vs. Chelsea score: Ronaldo's equalizer saves point, likely ends Man United's top-four bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United's home contest against Chelsea on Thursday was essentially a must-win if the Red Devils had any hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.
After that performance, it looks like the most they may be able to get is Europa League.
United entered the day six points back of fourth-place Arsenal, having lost to the Gunners last time out.
But an anemic attack and a defense with no cohesion struggled, with United settling for a fortunate 1-1 draw with the Blues.
With just three more league games left, the top-four hopes are probably over as the team has stumbled down the stretch.
