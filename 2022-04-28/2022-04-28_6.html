     Amazon Earnings Disappoint. The Bigger Issue Is the Outlook.
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amazon shares are down significantly in late trading Thursday after the company’s first-quarter results disappointed investors.
Amazon also forecast weaker-than-expected sales for the second quarter.
Results from both the company’s core online retailing business and its advertising unit came in short of Wall Street estimates, while Amazon Web Services had another strong quarter.

     Tech Stocks Lead Rally; Nasdaq Rises 3.1%
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. stocks soared Thursday, with technology stocks leading the charge, as investors cheered a solid earnings report from Meta Platforms that showed resilience in the face of rising inflation.
The Facebook owner’s stock rose $30.78, or 18%, to $205.73 after the company said it had added more users than investors expected in the first quarter.
That gain helped send the Nasdaq Composite Index up 382.59 points, or 3.1%, to 12871.53 and boosted the S&amp;P 500 technology sector, which was the best performing group in the index.

     Amazon shares fall on bleak forecast and slowest growth since dot-com bust
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It marks the slowest rate for any quarter since the dot-com bust in 2001 and the second straight period of single-digit growth.
Amazon shares dropped as much as 10% in extended trading on Thursday after the company issued a revenue forecast that trailed analysts' estimates.
To offset some of those costs, Amazon earlier this month introduced a 5% surcharge for some of its U.S. sellers, the first such fee in its history.
And last quarter, Amazon hiked the price of its U.S. Prime membership for the first time in four years to $139 from $119.
Google's ad revenue increased 22%, slowed down by YouTube, which recorded weaker-than-expected growth of 14%.

     Amazon reports $4B loss, stock takes a dive
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By Rishi Iyengar | CNNAmazon reported a significant loss in the first three months of the year, sending the company’s stock plunging.
The company attributed the loss largely to a $7.6 billion loss from its investment in electric automaker Rivian Automotive.
Rivian, into which Amazon led a $700 million investment in 2019, has seen its stock plummet more than 75% since its blockbuster November 2021 IPO.
“The pandemic and subsequent war in Ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement.
A separate Amazon union election in Bessemer, Alabama, also concluded recently with the results too close to call.

     Summary: In the first quarter of 2021, Amazon recorded net income of $8.1 billion, or $15.79 per diluted share.
Rivian’s shrinking valuation, which last fall briefly held a market capitalization larger than Volkswagen’s, caused a $7.6 billion loss for Amazon.
“We definitely see it on the cost side.”Amazon reported operating expenses of $112.7 billion, up from $99.6 billion a year ago.
The company saw an extra $6 billion in unexpected costs over the quarter, Olsavsky said Thursday, building on a trend that saw $4 billion in costs added at the end of last year as well.
It expects net sales to grow between 3 and 7% year over year to somewhere between $116 billion and $121 billion.
