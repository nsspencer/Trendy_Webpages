     FX's Under the Banner of Heaven is a Shocking, Fascinating Investigation of Faith
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Using its nuanced emphasis on faith, “Under the Banner of Heaven” gradually depicts in extensive flashback how their ways became so monstrous.
The performances that sometimes are too overzealous in their manic nature—like how Culkin transforms into complete mania and guttural scripture-spewing.
And while Worthington is especially stiff in a role that also calls for him to be gradually monstrous, Wyatt Russell gives the standout performance here.
Like his father, he can readily claim a challenge from Heavenly Father as just more fuel for his destructive fire.
It’s easy to imagine “Under the Banner of Heaven” without these moments, or in so much detail.

     The ambitious, sprawling Under The Banner Of Heaven can’t quite live up to its source material
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the big difference in how it’s filtered on screen is the addition of fictional Detective Jeb Pyre (Andrew Garfield), a devout Mormon himself.
Their initial prime suspect is Brenda’s husband, Allen (Billy Howle), who found his wife and child dead in their home in American Fork, Utah.
Garfield’s work is loaded with si lent, nuanced expressions that counteract nicely with the provocative flair of Howle, Russell, Worthington, and Rory Culkin, who plays another Lafferty brother, Samuel.
Sluggish pacing aside, the show also can’t make its Joseph Smith flashbacks nearly as interesting as the present-day murder case.
Even in the opening scene, as Jeb enters Brenda and Allen’s house, the audience doesn’t get a glimpse of the bloody gore.

     Under the Banner of Heaven review – ambitious but uneven true crime series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The predominant feeling throughout Under the Banner of Heaven, and ambitious and uneven adaptation of Jon Krakauer’s 2003 nonfiction book, is dread.
There’s that first horrific step down in the second scene, as Pyre recoils at a vicious crime scene.
The series attempts to translate Krakauer’s sweeping book through the overused prestige TV trop of multiple timelines.
By far the least successful storyline depicts Mormonism’s early days under founder Joseph Smith – himself a polygamist, although the LDS church did not admit this until 2014.
As a series, Under the Banner of Heaven struggles to maintain focus, but it never loses faith in that fact.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite claims that the Mormon Church is one of the fastest growing religions in the United States (source: the Mormon Church), in reality, like most organized religions in America, membership has been on a steady decline for the past decade.
Brenda, a former beauty queen with aspirations of becoming a television reporter, married into the Lafferty family, described as “the Utah Kennedys” and headed by the pious Ammon Lafferty (Christopher Heyerdahl).
Despite the strange mysticism and secrecy of the Mormon Church, Under the Banner of Heaven is a straightforward murder mystery, without the expected supernatural elements of, say, season one of True Detective.
It doesn’t need additional bells and whistles to make it creepy: it’s right there even in the early scenes of the Lafferty family.
Under the Banner of Heaven premieres today on Hulu.

     Under the Banner of Heaven Scratches the True Detective Itch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If “it often feels like True Detective” makes your ears perk up or “murder among the Mormons” is a tagline that speaks to you, then Under the Banner of Heaven will get the job done.
In spite of its overfamiliar rhythms and fancy murder-show aesthetics, there are elements of Under the Banner that achieve something distinct and idiosyncratic.
The most significant adaptation choice is the role of Detective Jeb Pyre, played by Andrew Garfield.
And it makes his partnership with Detective Taba (Gil Birmingham) similarly appealing, a pairing that resists simple “good cop, bad cop” or “veteran, rookie” oppositions.
But that’s also why Under the Banner of Heaven’s Pyre is such a smart creation.

     Andrew Garfield Dissects Religious Themes In ‘Under The Banner Of Heaven’

     Summary: UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN - "Rightful Place" Episode 2 (Airs Thursday, April 28th) - Pictured: ... [+] (l-r) Gil Birmingham as Bill Taba, Andrew Garfield as Jeb Pyre.
All Rights ReservedIn FX’s Under the Banner of Heaven, available only on Hulu beginning April 28, actor Andrew Garfield plays Detective Jeb Pyre in the original limited series inspired by the true crime bestseller by Jon Krakauer.
Pyre, a devout Mormon, begins discovering truths about the LDS religion that make him question his own faith during a murder investigation.
Garfield was looking for a unique challenge to follow up Spider-Man: No Way Home, a late 2021 box office juggernaut, with, and Under the Banner of Heaven served as just that.
“Yeah, that was the balance to strike for sure in terms of playing the character; that's the struggle,” Garfield told me.

     In ‘Under the Banner of Heaven,’ a Decapitated Baby Reveals the Ugly Depths of Mormon Extremism
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Writer/showrunner Dustin Lance Black’s seven-part FX on Hulu drama (April 28) is the based-on-real-events story of the 1984 investigation into the murder of a Utah mother and her infant daughter, and the ugly revelations about the Mormon church that ensued.
Worse, her 15-month-old daughter is upstairs in the bassinet, decapitated—a sight that brings a naturally aghast Pyre to tears.
As Under the Banner of Heaven eventually explicates, Brenda’s demise was related to the Laffertys’ escalating ties to fundamentalism (and their embrace of polygamy and anti-government, anti-taxation sentiments).
Consequently, one can imagine Under the Banner of Heaven more successfully succeeding as an in-depth 10-part series or, preferably, as a streamlined film devoid of its unnecessary tangents.
“Under the Banner of Heaven” is on Hulu from April 28.

     Summary: Under the leadership of Brigham Young, the Mormons were as militant a religious outsider group as any the Wild West ever saw.
And it didn’t hurt that Heavenly Father had told Dan to marry her.
With Robin still in custody, Pyre asks him if he has ever attended a group focused on tax issues.
At the same time, most of what we’ve seen so far has felt too quick, like a reenactment in a documentary.
Since they are doing these flashbacks, I hope they go all the way with it down the road.

DUSTIN LANCE BLACK: [“Under the Banner of Heaven”] is filled with the information that the Mormon church says to stay away from.
No fundamentalists, but I didn’t think it was important for me to meet any fundamentalists for the purposes of playing [Jeb].
It’s only in 2013 that the Mormon Church officially admitted for the first time that Joseph Smith had more than one wife.
I have real issues with the Mormon church, but I have really close, warm relationships with a lot of Mormons.
