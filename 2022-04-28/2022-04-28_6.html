     A CLOSER LOOK: Wide receiver Jameson Williams
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: As a high school junior, he had 36 catches for 1,069 yards, 15 TDs and an average of 29.5 yards per catch.
He was also a star in track and field, as a sprinter and long jumper.
Williams entered the transfer portal after seeing little action in his first two seasons at Ohio State.
He was an instant star on a Crimson Tide team that annually has its players drafted in the first round.
Many analysts say he would have been a Top 5 pick had it not been for the knee injury sustained in the national championship game.

     Summary: The Detroit Lions’ made an aggressive move in the first round of the 2022 NFL draft, trading up from pick No.
12 and selecting Alabama wide receiver Jameson Williams.
If not for an ACL injury suffered in the National Championship game, Williams likely would have been the top receiver selected in this draft cycle.
“A fearless competitor,” Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson said of Williams.
At Alabama, Williams was their WR-Z and was asked to stretch the field and make big plays.

     2022 NFL Draft Day Notes: Possible Trades, Jameson Williams Rising
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Three positions have stood out—corner, pass rusher and receiver.
Pass rusher: Michigan’s Aidan Hutchinson, Georgia’s Travon Walker, Oregon’s Kayvon Thibodeaux and Florida State’s Jermaine Johnson II constitute the first group.
I could see Philly moving up into the middle of the top 10, maybe for a corner, maybe for a pass rusher, maybe for a receiver.
It’s true that many of his splash plays are in chase-down situations and that he was more consistent as a pass rusher from the inside than the outside.
It’s also true, per NFL folks, that he needs to develop moves as a pass rusher if he’s going to be a dominant edge guy.

     Lions select Jameson Williams in 2022 NFL Draft: Fantasy Football and Dynasty outlooks, scouting report, more

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Jameson Williams was drafted by the Detroit Lions with 12th overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft.
With the Tide, Williams instantly served as a top receiver and was named a Biletnikoff Award finalist.
Williams told NFL Media in late March he was "ahead of schedule" in his rehabilitation and hopes to be ready for training camp.
Goff ranked 36th last year in adjusted completion rate on passes of 20-plus yards, attempting such passes on 9.1% of his throws.
Feasted on bombs -- 11 of his 15 touchdowns in 2021 were on passes traveling 15-plus Air Yards.
