     Amber Heard Promised Millions Of Dollars Of Her Divorce Settlement To The ACLU, But It's Only Received Less Than Half That
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After promising to donate half of her $7 million divorce settlement to the American Civil Liberties Union in 2016, Amber Heard personally gave and arranged for others to donate less than half of that, an official with the organization said Thursday.
Dougherty said Heard donated $350,000 to the ACLU "very soon" after August 2016, when she said in a statement that she would donate half of the divorce settlement to the ACLU and the other half to Children's Hospital Los Angeles.
At some point, her ex-husband Johnny Depp donated $100,000 to the ACLU on her behalf.
And another $500,000 and $350,000 were donated on Heard's behalf, bringing the total to $1.3 million donated out of the $3.5 million promised.
The scrutiny of Heard's giving comes as trial is underway in the $50 million defamation lawsuit Depp filed against her.

     How Much Money Has Amber Heard Paid to the ACLU?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The chief operating officer of the ACLU testified on Thursday that Amber Heard, Johnny Depp's ex-wife, has only paid $1.3 million of the $3.5 million she has pledged to donate to the organization.
During the testimony, ACLU Chief Operating Officer Terence Dougherty said that the ACLU received donations of $350,000, $500,000 and $350,000 that were all "associated" with Heard.
A $350,000 donation that was paid in August 2016 came directly from Heard, according to Dougherty.
Heard hasn't donated anything to ACLU since 2019 and she didn't sign a pledge form that ACLU prepared for her, according to Dougherty.
Heard's last donation to the organization was in December 2018 when she paid $350,000 from the donor-advised fund of Fidelity.

     Elon Musk chipped in for Amber Heard’s ACLU donation: Depp trial testimony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Billionaire Elon Musk appears to have chipped in at least $500,000 to ex-girlfriend Amber Heard’s donation to the American Civil Liberties Union, the organization’s general counsel testified Thursday.
The rest of the $1.3 million the ACLU eventually came from Depp, who forked over $100,000, and a donor Dougherty believes was Musk.
That money included a $500,000 donation from a fund at Vanguard and $350,000 from a Fidelity fund, Dougherty testified.
A letter to Heard regarding her $350,000 donation was provided during the trial.
ReutersTerence Dougherty testified that Heard only paid $350,000 of the $3.5 million pledge to the ACLU.

     ACLU: Files complaint alleging pervasive discrimination in Oshkosh Area School District
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: MILWAUKEE — The ACLU of Wisconsin filed a complaint earlier this week with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights asking them to investigate the Oshkosh Area School District after Black middle school students were expelled when they were racially harassed at school.
TreVon says he has experienced racially disparate punishment at Oshkosh Area School District schools since he was in Kindergarten, sometimes for minor things such as putting his head on his desk.
Seven Black students were ultimately referred for expulsion as a result of the events at the dance.
The complaint alleges that the District did not investigate the racial harassment that TreVon and Karizmah endured.
Additionally, at TreVon’s expulsion hearing, the school board official overseeing the hearing said that the racial harassment that occurred was ‘not relevant’ to TreVon’s expulsion.

     Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial: ACLU Believes Elon Musk Was Behind $500,000 Donation Toward Actress’s Pledge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The general counsel of the ACLU testified Thursday in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial in Virginia that the foundation believed billionaire Elon Musk was behind a $500,000 payment to help the actress fulfill a $3.5 million donation pledge to the organization.
Heard had said she would donate $7 million from her divorce settlement with Depp to charity, split between the ACLU and Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.
But in Depp’s $50 million defamation claim against Heard, his attorneys have been trying to show that Heard has not followed through on the pledge to the ACLU.
Dougherty said that the Musk payment was believed to have been made via a Vanguard fund set up to make charitable contributions.
Heard made a direct payment in August 2016 of $350,000, $500,000 in 2017 and $350,000 from a Vanguard fund in 2018.

     Summary: In response to an interview request by The Northwestern, the school district released this statement:"To date, the Oshkosh Area School District has not received any complaint filedby the ACLU and therefore is not in a position to comment further on any such complaint.
The sixth-grade girl also experienced persistent racial harassment and was targeted by a student who she claims harassed her daily and called her the N-word.
School leaders explain what's coming nextSeven Black students were later referred for expulsion as a result of the incident.
School administrators also called police and referred juvenile charges against the two siblings, as well as other Black students.
Lambert said she hoped the Office of Civil Rights would investigate the incidents of racial harassment and force the district to address the harm caused by creating a plan that would prevent racial harassment in the future.

     What Happened to Amber Heard’s ACLU Donations?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While this might seem granular, Heard’s alleged handling of this donation is key to Depp’s trial strategy.
Depp has contended that Heard’s abuse allegations and the sympathy they generated were a ploy for publicity.
By discussing Heard’s relationship with the ACLU — and suggesting she wasn’t forthcoming about her planned donations — he’s trying to undermine her credibility.
(Heard dated Musk after her split with Depp, though Musk was “just filling space,” according to testimony on April 27.)
Dougherty’s testimony also indicated that Heard’s op-ed was penned in close collaboration with ACLU staff.

     ACLU files federal complaint against Oshkosh public schools
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: OSHKOSH, Wis. (WBAY) - The ACLU of Wisconsin says it filed a federal complaint against the Oshkosh Area School District claiming “pervasive discrimination” against Black students.
The ACLU says the complaint filed earlier this week asks the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights to investigate the expulsion of Black middle school students when they were racially harassed at school.
According to the ACLU, seven Black students were referred for expulsion after an incident at a Halloween dance instigated by a white student who threw water on them and used racial slurs.
School administrators called the police and sought juvenile charges of disorderly conduct against the Black students but administrators didn’t punish or seek charges against the white student.
The ACLU alleged in its complaint that the sixth-grade girl says she experienced persistent racial harassment -- and was targeted daily by that white student it says started the conflict at the dance.
