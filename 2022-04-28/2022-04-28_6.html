    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AAPL earnings for Q2 2022 (calendar Q1) will be announced by the company later today, and analysts are expecting the news to be good.
While professional analysts are more cautious than independent ones, all expect significant year-on-year growth almost across the board …PED30 has collated a spreadsheet showing the consensus expectations of analysts for total revenue, as well as the anticipated breakdown by product category.
The bottom line is that analysts expect Apple to report total revenue of $95.51B, against $89.58B for the same quarter last year.
Analysts anticipate revenue growth for iPhone, Mac, and wearables (Apple Watch and AirPods).
The only area where they expect revenue to be flat is iPad, the consensus view actually predicting a marginal fall year-on-year.

     Apple shares dip after company warns of a possible $8 billion hit from supply constraints
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But Apple shares fell nearly 4% in extended trading after Apple CFO Luca Maestri warned of several challenges in the current quarter, including supply constraints related to Covid-19 that could hurt sales by between $4 billion and $8 billion.
Apple CEO Tim Cook added the company was "not immune" to supply chain challenges.
In addition, Apple said that its board of directors authorized $90 billion in share buybacks, maintaining its pace as the public company that spends the most buying its own shares.
The smartphone business grew over 5% during the quarter, yielding more evidence that the current iPhone 13 model is selling well.
The increase in sales also came despite a difficult year-over-year iPhone comparison, since the new iPhones were launched earlier in 2021.

     Apple (AAPL) Q2 Earnings: What to Expect
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: For Apple, supply chain disruptions and lockdowns in China, its second-largest market, have added to numerous headwinds.
While Apple stock has held relatively well during the selloff (up 11% in six months), shares have fallen 10% from their 52-week high and are down 6% year to date.
The downbeat projected fiscal year-over-year growth for EPS and revenue, and the lack of explosive growth, is one reason Apple stock has struggled.
For the long term, Apple’s revenue growth capability is not in question.
In the first quarter, Apple earned $2.10 per share on $123.95 billion in revenue, beating consensus of $1.89 per share on $118.4 billion in revenue.
