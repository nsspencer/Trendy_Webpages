     'The Offer' mines the drama behind the making of 'The Godfather'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Considering that one major fight over "The Godfather" was its length, there's some irony that the limited series devoted to the making of the classic film, "The Offer," runs way too long.
Setting that aside, this 10-part look back at Hollywood in the swingin' '70s is mostly good fun, anchored by Matthew Goode's appropriately scenery-devouring turn as Paramount boss Robert Evans.
The movie's producer, Albert S. Ruddy, is behind the series, which is credited as being "based on Albert Ruddy's experience of making 'The Godfather.'"
A more familiar tension is that Paramount has been on a rocky path, with its impatient owners pressuring Evans to deliver at the box office.
Evans is also thrown into a tailspin when his wife, Ali McGraw (Meredith Garretson), has a much-publicized affair with Steve McQueen while shooting "The Getaway."

     ‘The Offer’: Yes, Mario Puzo and Frank Sinatra Really Did Have an Altercation Inside Swanky L.A. Restaurant
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It may be hard to believe, but yes, Frank Sinatra really did let Mario Puzo have it for his perceived likeness in The Godfather, as featured in the first episode of The Offer.
Gallo’s Puzo sees Sinatra (Frank John Hughes) in Chasen’s and tries to meet him.
However, when Puzo was brought forth, Sinatra, according to Puzo, replied without looking up from his plate, “I don’t think so.
Who told you to put that in the book, your publisher?” Sinatra then began to “shout abuse” at the author, Puzo recalled.
The late Al Martino played Fontane in the first and third Godfather films.

     'The Offer' review: An indulgent look at the making of 'The Godfather'

     Summary: Part Hollywood tale, part gangster drama, Paramount+'s The Offer chronicles the making of The Godfather from start to finish, including behind-the-scenes drama with meddling studio execs — oh, and the Mafia.
Credit: Nicole Wilder / Paramount+The Offer shows us The Godfather through the eyes of producer Al Ruddy (Miles Teller).
Credit: Nicole Wilder / Paramount+It's not possible to tell the story of the making of The Godfather without talking about the film's connections to the Mafia.
Credit: Nicole Wilder / Paramount+The Offer hits its highs when it's delving into the development and production of The Godfather.
The Offer still has its joys: Goode's performance is delightfully smarmy, resulting in some of the show's best line deliveries.

     Summary: 'The Offer': 10 hours of self-indulgence about the making of 'The Godfather'Enlarge this image toggle caption Nicole Wilder/Paramount+ Nicole Wilder/Paramount+Michael Tolkin, who wrote the Hollywood satire The Player years ago, also wrote the new ten-hour Paramount Plus series The Offer, about the making of The Godfather.
But not only is The Godfather not "widely regarded" as the single greatest film of all time, it's not even "widely regarded" as the best Godfather movie!
The making of The Godfather has been extensively documented in books, including last fall's Leave The Gun, Take The Cannoli by Mark Seal.
If The Godfather was famous for countering the extant flat portrayals of mafia figures, The Offer is a throwback to them.

     ‘The Offer’ Is a ‘Godfather’ Origin Story You Can 100-Percent Refuse
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This misbegotten attempt to revisit that project proves that the opposite is just as true in equal measures.
Ruddy was the one who dodged Mickey Cohen’s bullets and made ethical compromises so they could shoot the Sicily sequences.
It’s genuinely surprising that the credits don’t list Teller’s co-stars as “Ruddy’s Director,” “Ruddy’s Star,” “Ruddy’s Boss,” “Ruddy’s Girlfriend,” and “Ruddy’s Mob Buddy.” This isn’t just a print-the-legend look at film history.
Say what you will about Ruddy, Evans, Colombo and Bludhorn: They were complicated characters, full of more than just sound and fury, and they’re reduced to one-dimensional archetypes here.
Memories shared serve each differently, yet everyone collectively remembers the making of The Godfather as inspiring a high point in American cinema.
