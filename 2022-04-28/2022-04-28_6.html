     US FDA moves to ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday issued a long-awaited proposal to ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars, a major victory for anti-smoking advocates but one that could dent sales at tobacco companies.
“The proposed rules would help prevent children from becoming the next generation of smokers and help adult smokers quit,” said the health and human services secretary, Xavier Becerra.
For decades, menthol cigarettes have been in the crosshairs of anti-smoking groups who have argued that they contribute to disproportionate health burdens on Black communities and play a role in luring young people into smoking.
Menthol cigarettes, banned in many states including California and Massachusetts, account for more than a third of the industry’s overall market share in the United States, even as overall smoking rates have been declining in the country.
Shares of Altria, British America Tobacco and Imperial Brands were mixed in afternoon trading.

     F.D.A. Moves to Ban Sales of Menthol Cigarettes

     Summary: Taking menthol cigarettes off the market is expected to further reduce smoking levels.
The ban does not cover menthol e-cigarettes.

Some menthol products remain on the market as the agency mulls how to rule on some of the top-selling devices.
A spokesman for Altria, which owns Philip Morris USA, which sells about 9 percent of the U.S. menthol cigarettes, warned that banning menthol would push the products into illegal, underground markets with no oversight and unfortunate health consequences.

     Summary: The FDA is proposing a ban on menthol cigarettesEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Chiu/AP Jeff Chiu/APThe Food and Drug Administration is proposing a ban on menthol-flavored cigarettes and all cigar flavorings, except for tobacco flavor, the agency said Thursday.
The proposal builds on the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which banned cigarette flavors — aside from tobacco and menthol — in 2009.
Erika Sward, assistant vice president of national advocacy for the American Lung Association, told NPR that the measure is "a big deal" and that rules to ban menthol are overdue.
In 2019, there were 18.5 million menthol cigarette smokers ages 12 and older in the U.S., according to the FDA.
In a letter last week, the organization urged the FDA to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes and flavored cigar products.

     FDA Issues Plan to Ban Menthol in Cigarettes, Cigars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: By MATTHEW PERRONE AP Health WriterWASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government on Thursday released its long-awaited plan to ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars, citing the toll on Black smokers and young people.
The Food and Drug Administration said eliminating menthol cigarettes could prevent between 300,000 and 650,000 smoking deaths over 40 years.
Altria, which sells menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars, said it disagreed with the ban.
"If these rules are finalized they become the law of the land and it becomes illegal for menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars to be sold."
With the slow decline of smoking, tobacco companies have been diversifying into alternative products, including electronic cigarettes and tobacco pouches.

The Food and Drug Administration said eliminating menthol cigarettes could prevent between 300,000 and 650,000 smoking deaths over 40 years.
For now, FDA leaders said they will take comments for two months and then proceed “as expeditiously as possible.”Altria, which sells menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars, said it disagreed with the ban.
In 2019, more than 18 million Americans smoked menthol cigarettes, with higher rates among young people, African Americans and other racial groups, according to the FDA.
Industry documents released via litigation show companies viewed menthol cigarettes as a good “starter product” because they were more palatable to teens.

     In a milestone, FDA proposes ban on menthol cigarettes, flavored cigars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, in remarks to reporters, said a ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars would save lives and reduce health disparities.
Menthol cigarettes make up about 36 percent of the market — and 50 percent of sales for Reynolds American, which manufactures Newport, the top-selling menthol brand.
Tobacco companies, which have long expressed opposition to a menthol ban, said a prohibition is unlikely to work and that menthol cigarettes should not be singled out.
Thursday’s move was foreshadowed almost exactly a year ago, when the FDA promised to propose a ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars within 12 months.
