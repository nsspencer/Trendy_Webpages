-- Drake London on playing with Kyle PittsWhat they need next: Edge rusher and receiver were the Falcons' top two needs heading into the draft, and they helped one of those position groups with the No.
They did so with Florida State pass rusher Jermaine Johnson and every receiver still available, hand-picking their favorite wideout from the group.
They need help rushing off the edge, maybe more than one pass rusher, in addition to offensive line help at guard and tackle.
Quarterback is the obvious wild card, with a level of uncertainty about whether they'll take a passer on Day 2 or at any point in this draft.

     Summary: With the eighth pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the Atlanta Falcons select Drake London, WR, USC.
There are legitimate concerns about London’s ability to separate, but as a big slot guy, he could be very special.
He signed with USC to play both sports, and saw action as a true freshman in both football and basketball.
Stat to Know: According to Pro Football Focus charting data, London led receivers with 19 contested catch receptions last year.
London also was a little inconsistent at the catch point, as he dropped eight catchable passes last season.

8 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft on Thursday night in Las Vegas.
An ankle fracture didn't prevent London from being selected in the top 10 and the highest-drafted wideout by Atlanta since Julio Jones in 2011.
The Falcons owned the worst receiver corps in the NFL ahead of the draft.
Adding a playmaker in London to pair with pass-catching tight end Kyle Pitts gives quarterback Marcus Mariota two big targets to work with in 2022.
