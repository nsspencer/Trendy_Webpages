     Instant Takeaways from Green Bay Packers Selecting LB Quay Walker
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsIn what I would consider a bit of a surprise, the Green Bay Packers select Georgia LB Quay Walker with the 22nd pick.
Instant takeaways from the Green Bay Packers selection– The top four WRs in this class all went early, and realistically, they were likely never in striking distance for the Green Bay Packers to make a fairly big jump up the draft board.
There is already a lot of cap space in future years accounted for, and Green Bay still hasn’t paid Jaire Alexander, Elgton Jenkins, or Rashan Gary.
– Walker should also provide a boost to the Green Bay Packers’ run defense–which ranked 30th last season in yards per carry allowed.
It’s clear that the Green Bay Packers are going to be relying more heavily on their defense than what they have in past seasons.

     Aaron Rodgers says Green Bay Packers trading Davante Adams 'surprised' him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said he was "surprised" by the team trading former receiver Davante Adams this offseason, in his first public comments since signing a three-year, $150 million extension and the trade of his No.
In March, Green Bay traded Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders for a 2022 first-round and second-round pick.
His departure left the Packers' wide receiver room thin -- a situation exacerbated when Marquez Valdes-Scantling signed with the Kansas City Chiefs a week later.
Rodgers was on the air with McAfee when the Packers picked Wyatt, a player Rodgers said he knew the Packers were hoping to land.
Meanwhile, during the draft, Gutekunst said coach Matt LaFleur was in an on-going text conversation with Rodgers.

     Summary: "There's a whole lot I need to get better at, but nothing I can't get better at."
Gutekunst said the Packers started scouting Walker early in the process and saw a player whose career has shown a steady progression.
He had 1½ sacks among 5½ tackles for loss, and he was credited with 25 QB pressures in 15 games, including six in the final game against the Crimson Tide.
"For us it was always a race to the ball," Walker said of Georgia's loaded defense, which saw two linemen – Travon Walker at No.
Georgia safety Lewis Cine was then chosen by the Vikings with the final selection of the first round.
