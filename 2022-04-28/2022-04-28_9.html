     Summary: Watch : 5 SHOCKING Moments From Johnny Depp &amp; Amber Heard TrialElon Musk won't have to take the stand in a Virginia courtroom for the Johnny Depp and ex-wife Amber Heard's ongoing defamation trial.
The billionaire was originally listed as potential witness for Heard in pre-trial filings for the case, in which Depp is suing heard for $50 million.
Heard and Depp are accusing each other of violence during their one year of marriage; each party denies the allegations.
Heard, 36, dated Musk for nearly a year following her divorce from Depp, 58, in January 2016.
The Hollywood Reporter initially reported that Musk became "infatuated" with Heard and began emailing Rodriguez and his team to set up dinners and lunches with her.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk and James Franco will not testify at the defamation trial opposing Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, a source familiar with the situation has confirmed to The Independent.
Mr Carino told the jury that Ms Heard dated Mr Musk while she was trying to reconcile with Mr Depp following their divorce.
Eleanor Laws QC, who represented Mr Depp, read out text messages from May 2016, in which Ms Heard told Mr Musk she was going to obtain a restraining order against her then-husband Mr Depp.
Joshua Drew, a friend of Ms Heard, told the court he had heard Mr Depp had a “particular issue” with Mr Franco, and that mention of his name would “cause fights” between Ms Heard and Mr Depp.
Mr Depp’s side subpoenaed Mr Franco in the Virginia case for some of his past communications and documents reflecting interactions with Ms Heard.

     Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial: ACLU Believes Elon Musk Was Behind $500,000 Donation Toward Actress’s Pledge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The general counsel of the ACLU testified Thursday in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial in Virginia that the foundation believed billionaire Elon Musk was behind a $500,000 payment to help the actress fulfill a $3.5 million donation pledge to the organization.
Heard had said she would donate $7 million from her divorce settlement with Depp to charity, split between the ACLU and Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.
But in Depp’s $50 million defamation claim against Heard, his attorneys have been trying to show that Heard has not followed through on the pledge to the ACLU.
Dougherty said that the Musk payment was believed to have been made via a Vanguard fund set up to make charitable contributions.
Heard made a direct payment in August 2016 of $350,000, $500,000 in 2017 and $350,000 from a Vanguard fund in 2018.
