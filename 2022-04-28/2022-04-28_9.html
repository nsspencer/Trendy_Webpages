     2022 NFL Draft: Round 1 results tracker, Seahawks news, and live updates
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The 2022 NFL Draft is underway, and with the Seattle Seahawks set to enter their first season since 2011 without Russell Wilson under center, head coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider have work to do to return the Seahawks to relevance.
The heart of free agency is, of course, in the rear view mirror, but there are plenty of noteworthy names who remain unsigned and available to fill holes in the roster.
That said, before turning their attention to filling out the roster with veterans, the team has the opportunity to add youth and upside in the coming days in the draft and then in the undrafted free agency frenzy that will follow.
Whether or not the first player the Seahawks select plays one of those positions, the team certainly has several holes to fill.
Here is how outsiders see the needs of the team by position heading into the draft.

     This is Russell Wilson’s message to the team’s upcoming draft class
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the 2012 NFL draft, Denver Broncos QB Russell Wilson didn’t hear his name called until the third round in part because of height concerns.
Wilson landed with the Seattle Seahawks after then-Denver GM John Elway drafted Brock Osweiller over Wilson in the second round.
A decade later, Paton got his man, Wilson, after sending the Seahawks a nest of draft picks alongside Drew Lock, Noah Fant and Shelby Harris.
Going into it, Seattle gave me that amazing chance, and now Denver is giving me this amazing chance to step up and play.
Denver’s new rookies will aim to emulate the work rate Wilson has displayed since he entered the league ten years ago.

“All I’ve ever said is I need one person to give me a chance — one team,” Wilson said when I asked about that draft earlier this week.

“The whole league missed (on Wilson) because he could throw, was certainly athletic and won — kind of like he does now,” Paton said.

     Seahawks have drafted just 2 quarterbacks in 12 years under Carroll, Schneider. Well...
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s all the quarterbacks coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider have drafted in a dozen years.
Within months of Carroll and Schneider drafting him, by the third game of his rookie preseason, Wilson beat out Flynn for the Seahawks’ job.
That’s why McGough is the only other quarterback Carroll and Schneider drafted from 2010 into Thursday.
The national consensus entering this draft was that because they just traded Wilson, the Seahawks must draft a quarterback.
Carroll and Schneider loved Lock when he was coming out of the University of Missouri for the draft in 2019.
