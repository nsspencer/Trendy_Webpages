     Ravens Trade Wide Receiver Marquise Brown to Cardinals
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Brown was the Ravens' leading wide receiver last season, hauling in 91 passes for 1,008 yards and six touchdowns.
But Baltimore also used a first-round pick on Rashod Bateman in last year's draft, and he will now be relied upon to take on an even bigger share of the load.
Brown was approaching his fourth NFL season and the Ravens hadn't picked up his fifth-year option yet, although General Manager Eric DeCosta said the expectation was that Baltimore would.
