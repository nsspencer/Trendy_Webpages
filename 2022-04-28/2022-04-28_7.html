     Malik Willis’s college coach says Panthers, Steelers and Seahawks showed most interest
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesLiberty quarterback Malik Willis may be the best quarterback in the 2022 NFL draft, but unlike previous years, there’s no talk of a quarterback going first overall.
In fact, Liberty coach Hugh Freeze said on NFL Network this morning that he has no idea where Willis will go.
“I usually have an idea, but I have no clue on what’s really going to happen tonight,” Freeze said.
“I don’t think that’s a question in my mind,” Freeze said when asked if Willis can start as a rookie.
“I also believe he can handle being the backup if that’s what’s best for that organization.

     Malik Willis gracious after not being selected in 1st round of NFL Draft: 'Still super appreciative and thankful'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Quarterback was a huge topic of conversation heading into this year's NFL Draft.
Without one standing head and shoulders over the rest of the class a la Trevor Lawrence, the discussion generally turned to whether teams could ignore the hand size of Pitt's Kenny Pickett or the quality of opponent of Liberty's Malik Willis.
When the dust settled, Pickett was the only quarterback taken in the first round.

     Summary: On what could be a big night for Liberty’s Malik Willis, he had some fun with the NFL Network’s Twitter mistake (which happens sometimes!).
The Twitter account captured the quarterback at the NFL Draft getting a sweet look from a woman by his side.
But then Willis jumped on Twitter to say, “That’s my grandma” with a couple of cry-laughing emojis to indicate no hard feelings.
I love it almost as much as Willis’s response: “Oops.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In 2013, there was a weak quarterback class for the NFL draft.
NFL teams didn't push quarterbacks into the first round just to do it.
The 2022 quarterback class will hopefully have better success than that 2013 class, but it was a similar story on Thursday night.
Liberty quarterback Malik Willis was not selected in the first round of the NFL draft.
But NFL teams weren't impressed, at least not enough to take more than one in the first round on Thursday.
