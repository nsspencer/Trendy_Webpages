     3 Big Things from the Green Bay Packers 1st Round Picks
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The first round of the 2022 NFL Draft is in the books, and the Green Bay Packers loaded up on defense — more on that in a minute — selecting linebacker Quay Walker and interior defensive lineman Devonte Wyatt, both from Georgia.
The second round, where the Packers have three more selections, will begin Friday evening, but before we look ahead, I take a look back at Green Bay’s first-round with my 3 Big Things.
As I wrote a few weeks ago, while Green Bay certainly had the draft capital to pull off the trade for Brown, there is always more to it than that–which in this case meant a new deal.
Realistically, from a cap perspective, Green Bay likely never could have made an extension work with Brown–or any of the young receivers who may be available.
With the Vikings, perhaps they weren’t willing the make a deal with Green Bay, given that they are still trying to chase them down in the NFC North.

     Explosive Devonte Wyatt feels right at home with Packers
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The third just so happened to be linebacker Quay Walker, whom Green Bay selected with its initial first-round pick at 22.
In fact, Walker was in midst of speaking with Green Bay reporters when commissioner Roger Goodell announced the Packers had just drafted Wyatt.
According to Wyatt, Walker called him immediately after his conference call ended to offer his congratulations.
We're just ready to go to Green Bay and help the team; just learn the books and become a great player for the Packers."
Wyatt might have been the third Bulldogs defensive lineman to be drafted Thursday, but his talent and upside are undeniable.

     Aaron Rodgers says Green Bay Packers trading Davante Adams 'surprised' him
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said he was "surprised" by the team trading former receiver Davante Adams this offseason, in his first public comments since signing a three-year, $150 million extension and the trade of his No.
In March, Green Bay traded Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders for a 2022 first-round and second-round pick.
His departure left the Packers' wide receiver room thin -- a situation exacerbated when Marquez Valdes-Scantling signed with the Kansas City Chiefs a week later.
Rodgers was on the air with McAfee when the Packers picked Wyatt, a player Rodgers said he knew the Packers were hoping to land.
Meanwhile, during the draft, Gutekunst said coach Matt LaFleur was in an on-going text conversation with Rodgers.

Meanwhile, Green Bay sat with pick No.
Green Bay, in a “win now” mode with Aaron Rodgers in his final years, needed receivers.
