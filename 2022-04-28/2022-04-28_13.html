     New York Jets land CB Ahmad 'Sauce' Gardner, WR Garrett Wilson in first round of 2022 NFL draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After the Jets draft Sauce Gardner, he makes a wrong turn and has to hustle back to get to the stage.
The Wilson pick suggests the Jets have moved on from the idea of trading for disgruntled San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel.
The Samuel speculation sparked intense drama, but the Jets decided to keep their draft picks and build through the draft.
The selection of Wilson, picked with the draft pick the Jets acquired from the Seattle Seahawks for Jamal Adams, was applauded by Jets quarterback Zach Wilson.
The Jets' primary goal this offseason is to improve the talent around second-year quarterback Wilson, who struggled as a rookie.

Wilson starred at Ohio State alongside Chris Olave, and the two teamed up to help quarterback C.J.
Stroud make a bid for the Heisman Trophy in his first season under center for the Buckeyes.
