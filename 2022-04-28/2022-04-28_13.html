     Halyna Hutchins’ family slams sheriff after ‘Rust’ bodycam footage released
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The family of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins is slamming the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office for releasing video of the final moments before her death on the set of "Rust," saying the "damage" the police have done is "irreparable."
A letter from the attorney for the Hutchins family says the sheriff's office "trampled" on husband Matthew Hutchins' "constitutional right" by giving "less than a business day to review the materials" before they were released to the public.
The attorney for the family also called for the Santa Fe Sheriff's Office to take down the video footage of Hutchins dying on the floor of a church on the movie set.
Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza spoke on TODAY Tuesday about why his office released the trove of evidence.
NBC News reached out to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office about the letter from the Hutchins family but did not receive a response.

     Halyna Hutchins’s Family Demands Rust Shooting Footage Be Removed
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Earlier this week, disturbing footage from the tragic Rust shooting that claimed the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza was released by the Santa Fe Sheriff’s Office.
“Your office trampled on the constitutional rights of the Hutchins” family, attorney Brian Panish wrote in a letter dated April 27 to Sheriff Adan Mendoza, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Panish said that New Mexico law grants victims the right to review such material before its released to the public.
As stated in the letter, the sheriff’s office gave the Hutchins family less than one business day to evaluate the footage.
In the meantime, Hutchins’s family is fighting to see footage of her death wiped from the internet.

     Police Dump Of ‘Rust’ Fatal Shooting Probe Files Castigated By Halyna Hutchins’ Estate
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The release by police this week of footage of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins dying on set last year after being fatally shot by Alec Baldwin has lawyers for the Hutchins family fuming.
“We also demand that your office take down the video footage of Halyna Hutchins dying on the church floor,” the LA-based lawyer adds.
Your office promised to allow Mr. Hutchins to review the materials being publicly released in advance of their dissemination to the press.
But even this arrangement was violated when your office released the materials to the public before releasing the materials to Mr. Hutchins.
The first time Mr. Hutchins saw the disturbing and unsettling video footage of his dying wife lying on the church floor was on Radar Online, an internet website.
