     NY Giants snag Evan Neal with No. 7 pick, second first-rounder in 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama star offensive tackle Evan Neal is coming to Big Blue with the seventh pick in the NFL Draft.
He should slot in at right tackle, and at 6-foot-7 and 337 pounds, Neal is the ideal bookend to Andrew Thomas.
Big Blue had its pick of offensive linemen, and Neal was the choice.
He dominated as a left tackle in his final season in college, but also has experience playing right tackle last season and the year before he played left guard.
He possesses the physical measurables NFL scouts seek in an offensive tackle, and his tape matches those numbers.

Not only is Neal considered one of the top offensive tackles in all of this year’s draft, but he also fills an immediate voice on the Giants’ offensive line.
The NY Giants get it right by drafting Kayvon Thibodeaux and Evan NealIt’s true, this year’s draft will go down as one of the most important in franchise history because on paper, the Giants have easily earned passing grades with both these draft picks.
Thibodeaux will easily be a force to reckon with immediately upon arrival and now, the Giants’ offensive line just got a whole lot better thanks to everything Neal brings to the table.
As of right now, the remaining draft selections the Giants have are…Round 2: No.

     Why NY Giants declined option on Daniel Jones contract, yet picked up Dexter Lawrence
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: EAST RUTHERFORD - The Giants have declined to pick up the fifth-year option on Daniel Jones' rookie contract, making the 2022 season the final year on his current deal.
Don't take that as a sign team brass doesn't still believe in Jones as the starting quarterback, however - at least not yet.
But business is business, and it's also why the Giants have decided to pick up the fifth-year option on defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence, the 17th overall pick in 2019.
GIANTS DRAFT PICKS:Round-by-round selections and analysisHere's a look at both decisionsThe Giants would stand to lose roughly $8 million in the best-case scenario by not picking up Jones' fifth-year option, which seemed all along to be the most likely scenario.
On the flip side, if the Giants picked up Jones' option for roughly $22 million for 2023 and he does not take that leap, they've gambled and lost that for next season.

     New York Giants won't exercise fifth-year option on QB Daniel Jones
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dan Orlovsky breaks down why he doesn't expect Daniel Jones to be with the Giants past this upcoming season.
(0:55)EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The New York Giants have elected to decline the fifth-year option on quarterback Daniel Jones' rookie contract, a source told ESPN's Dianna Russini.
The Giants did opt to pick up the fifth-year option on the rookie contract of defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence, the team announced.
Darnold is guaranteed $18.9 million this season after the Panthers traded for him and picked up his fifth-year option before he ever played a game for the team.
Cleveland, which ultimately landed Deshaun Watson, is in a similar position with Baker Mayfield, who also had his fifth-year option picked up last year.
