     The Disturbing True Story Behind Under the Banner of Heaven
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dan asked Allen what he thought of the so-called revelation, and the younger brother he'd defend his wife and child at all costs.
But, according to Krakauer, Allen never told Brenda that Ron was seriously considering killing her and their baby.
"If he had told Brenda about Ron's revelation, she would have been out of there in a minute and she'd still be alive today," Betty said.
Dan met Ricky Knapp doing construction in Wichita, Ks., then Ron joined them and they drove to Oregon's Willamette Valley, where Dan met his soon-to-be third wife, Laurene Grant.
Instead, at some point Ron got it into his head that the 24th would be "'The Day,'" as Dan remembered it to Krakauer.

     Under the Banner of Heaven – Review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Now, in the story of Under the Banner of Heaven, money doesn’t play a big role, but control definitely does.
Think more The Handmaid’s Tale and less The Eyes of Tammy Faye (which also co-starred Andrew Garfield).
The main protagonist is Police Detective Pyre (Andrew Garfield) who is a devout member of the LDS as well.
A great performance from him in that series, but he is at least as good here in Under the Banner of Heaven.
Also, alongside Andrew Garfield in the lead role, we have his colleague, Detective Taba, portrayed by Gil Birmingham (Wind River, Pieces of Her) who is not in the LDS Church.

     'Under the Banner of Heaven': Who Killed Brenda Wright Lafferty?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Under the Banner of Heaven is a look into the real-life murder of 24-year-old Brenda Wright Lafferty and her 15-month-old daughter Erica in 1984.
Here is everything you need to know about the real case, as well as who killed Wright Lafferty and her infant daughter.
Who Killed Brenda Wright Lafferty?
Her mother LaRae Wright told Jon Krakauer in his nonfiction book Under the Banner of Heaven, which the show is based on, that Lafferty and Wright Lafferty had "hit it off" immediately.
When he became abusive it was Wright Lafferty who persuaded Dianna to get a divorce, which she did in 1983.

     FX on Hulu’s ‘Under the Banner of Heaven’ review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We do glimpse the first body, a young mother lying face down in her kitchen in a pool of blood.
Pyre takes a few moments to gather himself before exiting the formerly cozy home in the distant Salt Lake City suburbs.
AdvertisementIn many respects, “Under the Banner of Heaven” is a deeply conventional (and heavily fictionalized) police procedural in which the investigator finds himself destabilized by a uniquely disturbing case.
“Under the Banner of Heaven” is most compelling when it explores the circumstances that paved the way for the Lafferty brood’s self-conversion and smartly concludes there’s no single reason for it.
Under the Banner of Heaven (seven episodes) premieres Thursday with Episodes 1 and 2 on FX on Hulu.

     Under The Banner of Heaven, review: Murder meets Mormonism in Andrew Garfield’s grisly true crime drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We’ve seen TV cops ingratiate themselves with suspects before, but on Under the Banner of Heaven, faith is as important as the facts.
Under the Banner of Heaven’s biggest challenge is to convey the finer details of the religion without getting lost in them.
Andrew Garfield in a still from Under the Banner of Heaven (FX)But it’s the sifting of what separates Mormonism from the fundamentalist religions practised in its name that distinguishes Under the Banner of Heaven from the glut of true crime offerings on TV right now.
What if it’s not just a husband whose heart turned against his wife?” Jeb asks his wife in what has to be TV’s least sexy shower scene ever.
In this sense, Under the Banner of Heaven doesn’t hit the suspenseful beats we’ve come to expect from crime drama, but it has nuance the genre often lacks.

     In ‘Under the Banner of Heaven’ a Decapitated Baby Reveals the Ugly Depths of Mormon Extremism
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Writer/showrunner Dustin Lance Black’s seven-part FX on Hulu drama (April 28) is the based-on-real-events story of the 1984 investigation into the murder of a Utah mother and her infant daughter, and the ugly revelations about the Mormon church that ensued.
Worse, her 15-month-old daughter is upstairs in the bassinet, decapitated—a sight that brings a naturally aghast Pyre to tears.
As Under the Banner of Heaven eventually explicates, Brenda’s demise was related to the Laffertys’ escalating ties to fundamentalism (and their embrace of polygamy and anti-government, anti-taxation sentiments).
Consequently, one can imagine Under the Banner of Heaven more successfully succeeding as an in-depth 10-part series or, preferably, as a streamlined film devoid of its unnecessary tangents.
“Under the Banner of Heaven” is on Hulu from April 28.

     ‘Under the Banner of Heaven’: Acting the main draw for series on shocking Utah murders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‘Under the Banner of Heaven’UntitledA seven-part series premiering with two episodes Thursday on Hulu.
A new episode will be released on each subsequent Thursday.
Daisy Edgar-Jones is a luminous presence as Brenda Wright Lafferty, who comes from a relatively progressive family of Idaho Mormons and falls in love with Allen Lafferty (Billy Howle).
The investigation eventually turns to brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty—and as we see in flashback sequences, each of these supposedly devout men has previously demonstrated truly evil inclinations.
Still, this is an involving and fascinating and sometimes shocking effort, with strong writing and outstanding performances from the entire cast, with Andrew Garfield leading the way and Daisy Edgar-Jones giving the story its true heart.
