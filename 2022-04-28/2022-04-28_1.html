     Summary: Rangnick admits there needs to be a conversation with Ronaldo about next term, as Erik ten Hag prepares to take charge of the Reds, with Champions League football looking even more of a remote possibility.
When asked directly about the no.7's future, Ralf replied: "This is something that we should speak about between Erik and the board and myself.
"It is also important to find out what he wants, if he wants to stay."
In a separate interview with Sky Sports, he stressed: “In the end, it’s both Erik’s and also Cris’s decision what they want to do.
It is not for me to speak about that but, today, the performance of Cris was really great.”

     Summary: Cristiano Ronaldo rescued a point for Manchester United again, as they salvaged a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United's home contest against Chelsea on Thursday was essentially a must-win if the Red Devils had any hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.
After that performance, it looks like the most they may be able to get is Europa League.
United entered the day six points back of fourth-place Arsenal, having lost to the Gunners last time out.
But an anemic attack and a defense with no cohesion struggled, with United settling for a fortunate 1-1 draw with the Blues.
With just three more league games left, the top-four hopes are probably over as the team has stumbled down the stretch.

Chelsea remain a comfortable third, six points clear of Arsenal in fourth and eight points above fifth-placed Tottenham.

- Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+- Don't have ESPN?
As the anti-Glazer protests in and around Old Trafford before and during the Chelsea game showed, the fans pin the blame for years of stagnation firmly at the door of United's American owners.
Not even another goal from Cristiano Ronaldo could earn Manchester United a win over Chelsea on Thursday night.
On the evidence of this United team, though, he needs to have the qualities of Brady and Ronaldo rolled into one to bring the good times back to Old Trafford.
