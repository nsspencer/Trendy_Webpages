     'Under the Banner of Heaven': Who Killed Brenda Wright Lafferty?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Under the Banner of Heaven is a look into the real-life murder of 24-year-old Brenda Wright Lafferty and her 15-month-old daughter Erica in 1984.
Here is everything you need to know about the real case, as well as who killed Wright Lafferty and her infant daughter.
Who Killed Brenda Wright Lafferty?
Her mother LaRae Wright told Jon Krakauer in his nonfiction book Under the Banner of Heaven, which the show is based on, that Lafferty and Wright Lafferty had "hit it off" immediately.

     Andrew Garfield: 'Under the Banner' doesn't sensationalize horrifying real-life murders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: AdvertisementThe drama stars Garfield as Jeb Pyre -- a devout Mormon, fictional composite character inspired by the police detectives investigating the Laffertys' deaths.
"I found it so deeply fascinating -- the themes, the story itself, how thrilling the story was, but also how horrifying it was," the actor explained.
"It is about ultimately the pursuit of the truth in the face of potential loss of one's family, one's social structure, one's life," Garfield said before passing the question to Black.
"I'm always intrigued by family stories, family dynamics, groups of people, in general, trying to accomplish something, but family stories always resonate with me," Howard said.

     In ‘Under the Banner of Heaven’ a Decapitated Baby Reveals the Ugly Depths of Mormon Extremism
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Writer/showrunner Dustin Lance Black’s seven-part FX on Hulu drama (April 28) is the based-on-real-events story of the 1984 investigation into the murder of a Utah mother and her infant daughter, and the ugly revelations about the Mormon church that ensued.
Worse, her 15-month-old daughter is upstairs in the bassinet, decapitated—a sight that brings a naturally aghast Pyre to tears.
As Under the Banner of Heaven eventually explicates, Brenda’s demise was related to the Laffertys’ escalating ties to fundamentalism (and their embrace of polygamy and anti-government, anti-taxation sentiments).
Consequently, one can imagine Under the Banner of Heaven more successfully succeeding as an in-depth 10-part series or, preferably, as a streamlined film devoid of its unnecessary tangents.
“Under the Banner of Heaven” is on Hulu from April 28.

     Under The Banner of Heaven, review: Murder meets Mormonism in Andrew Garfield’s grisly true crime drama
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We’ve seen TV cops ingratiate themselves with suspects before, but on Under the Banner of Heaven, faith is as important as the facts.
Under the Banner of Heaven’s biggest challenge is to convey the finer details of the religion without getting lost in them.
Andrew Garfield in a still from Under the Banner of Heaven (FX)But it’s the sifting of what separates Mormonism from the fundamentalist religions practised in its name that distinguishes Under the Banner of Heaven from the glut of true crime offerings on TV right now.
What if it’s not just a husband whose heart turned against his wife?” Jeb asks his wife in what has to be TV’s least sexy shower scene ever.
In this sense, Under the Banner of Heaven doesn’t hit the suspenseful beats we’ve come to expect from crime drama, but it has nuance the genre often lacks.

     Summary: We do glimpse the first body, a young mother lying face down in her kitchen in a pool of blood.
Pyre takes a few moments to gather himself before exiting the formerly cozy home in the distant Salt Lake City suburbs.
AdvertisementIn many respects, “Under the Banner of Heaven” is a deeply conventional (and heavily fictionalized) police procedural in which the investigator finds himself destabilized by a uniquely disturbing case.
“Under the Banner of Heaven” is most compelling when it explores the circumstances that paved the way for the Lafferty brood’s self-conversion and smartly concludes there’s no single reason for it.
Under the Banner of Heaven (seven episodes) premieres Thursday with Episodes 1 and 2 on FX on Hulu.

     ‘Under the Banner of Heaven’: Acting the main draw for series on shocking Utah murders
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: ‘Under the Banner of Heaven’UntitledA seven-part series premiering with two episodes Thursday on Hulu.
A new episode will be released on each subsequent Thursday.
Daisy Edgar-Jones is a luminous presence as Brenda Wright Lafferty, who comes from a relatively progressive family of Idaho Mormons and falls in love with Allen Lafferty (Billy Howle).
The investigation eventually turns to brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty—and as we see in flashback sequences, each of these supposedly devout men has previously demonstrated truly evil inclinations.
Still, this is an involving and fascinating and sometimes shocking effort, with strong writing and outstanding performances from the entire cast, with Andrew Garfield leading the way and Daisy Edgar-Jones giving the story its true heart.
