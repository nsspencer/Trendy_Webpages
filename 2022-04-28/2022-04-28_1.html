     Manchester United vs. Chelsea score: Ronaldo's equalizer saves point, likely ends Man United's top-four bid
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United's home contest against Chelsea on Thursday was essentially a must-win if the Red Devils had any hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.
After that performance, it looks like the most they may be able to get is Europa League.
United entered the day six points back of fourth-place Arsenal, having lost to the Gunners last time out.
But an anemic attack and a defense with no cohesion struggled, with United settling for a fortunate 1-1 draw with the Blues.
With just three more league games left, the top-four hopes are probably over as the team has stumbled down the stretch.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Cristiano Ronaldo rescued a point for Manchester United again, as they salvaged a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford.
Marcos Alonso's brilliant volley had put a dominant visiting side ahead on the hour mark, but an instant response from United's talisman helped them avoid another defeat at home.
Chelsea were on top for the majoirty of the evening, with Mason Mount and Reece James combining well throughout.
The result puts the visitors six points clear of fourth-placed Arsenal with five games to go, whereas United are five points off the Champions League places having played a couple games more.

     Rangnick could balance Austria job with Manchester United consultancy role
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick is seriously considering an offer to manage the Austria national team.
The Athletic understands that the job offer does not impact Rangnick’s plan to work in a consultancy role at Manchester United, however.
After Manchester United's 1-1 draw with Chelsea, Rangnick was asked about the Austria job.
Rangnick is due to start a two-year consultancy role with United at the end of the season, but could juggle that position with the Austria job.
Rangnick said on Thursday that he was determined to help United “change for the better” once he moves upstairs into his consultancy role.

When asked directly about the no.7's future, Ralf replied: "This is something that we should speak about between Erik and the board and myself.
"It is also important to find out what he wants, if he wants to stay."
In a separate interview with Sky Sports, he stressed: “In the end, it’s both Erik’s and also Cris’s decision what they want to do.
It is not for me to speak about that but, today, the performance of Cris was really great.”
