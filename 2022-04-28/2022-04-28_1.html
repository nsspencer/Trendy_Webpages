     The Disturbing True Story Behind Under the Banner of Heaven
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Dan asked Allen what he thought of the so-called revelation, and the younger brother said he'd defend his wife and child at all costs.
But, according to Krakauer, Allen never told Brenda that Ron was seriously considering killing her and their baby.
"If he had told Brenda about Ron's revelation, she would have been out of there in a minute and she'd still be alive today," Betty said.
Dan met Ricky Knapp doing construction in Wichita, Ks., then Ron joined them and they drove to Oregon's Willamette Valley, where Dan met his soon-to-be third wife, Laurene Grant.
Instead, at some point Ron got it into his head that the 24th would be "'The Day,'" as Dan remembered it to Krakauer.

     'Under the Banner of Heaven' flies high, while 'Shining Girls' doesn't
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Under the Banner of Heaven" isn't quite a great show, but it's a solidly good one, which is more than can be said for "Shining Girls," which mostly squanders a cast headlined by Elisabeth Moss, who doubles as its producer.
Elisabeth Moss and Wagner Moura in 'Shining Girls,' premiering on Apple TV+.
While "Shining Girls" seems potentially intriguing at first glance, by the time one has watched to the end of its disappointing eight episodes its light is flickering, and for viewers, it'll be too late to hit the reset button.
"Under the Banner of Heaven" premieres April 28 on Hulu.
"Shining Girls" premieres April 29 on Apple TV+.

     Under the Banner of Heaven chillingly depicts murder in the name of faith
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite claims that the Mormon Church is one of the fastest growing religions in the United States (source: the Mormon Church), in reality, like most organized religions in America, membership has been on a steady decline for the past decade.
Brenda, a former beauty queen with aspirations of becoming a television reporter, married into the Lafferty family, described as “the Utah Kennedys” and headed by the pious Ammon Lafferty (Christopher Heyerdahl).
Despite the strange mysticism and secrecy of the Mormon Church, Under the Banner of Heaven is a straightforward murder mystery, without the expected supernatural elements of, say, season one of True Detective.
It doesn’t need additional bells and whistles to make it creepy: it’s right there even in the early scenes of the Lafferty family.
Under the Banner of Heaven premieres today on Hulu.

     The ambitious, sprawling Under The Banner Of Heaven can’t quite live up to its source material
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the big difference in how it’s filtered on screen is the addition of fictional Detective Jeb Pyre (Andrew Garfield), a devout Mormon himself.
Their initial prime suspect is Brenda’s husband, Allen (Billy Howle), who found his wife and child dead in their home in American Fork, Utah.
Garfield’s work is loaded with si lent, nuanced expressions that counteract nicely with the provocative flair of Howle, Russell, Worthington, and Rory Culkin, who plays another Lafferty brother, Samuel.
Sluggish pacing aside, the show also can’t make its Joseph Smith flashbacks nearly as interesting as the present-day murder case.
Even in the opening scene, as Jeb enters Brenda and Allen’s house, the audience doesn’t get a glimpse of the bloody gore.

     FX on Hulu’s ‘Under the Banner of Heaven’ review
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: We do glimpse the first body, a young mother lying face down in her kitchen in a pool of blood.
Pyre takes a few moments to gather himself before exiting the formerly cozy home in the distant Salt Lake City suburbs.
AdvertisementIn many respects, “Under the Banner of Heaven” is a deeply conventional (and heavily fictionalized) police procedural in which the investigator finds himself destabilized by a uniquely disturbing case.
“Under the Banner of Heaven” is most compelling when it explores the circumstances that paved the way for the Lafferty brood’s self-conversion and smartly concludes there’s no single reason for it.
Under the Banner of Heaven (seven episodes) premieres Thursday with Episodes 1 and 2 on FX on Hulu.

     Summary: The Mormon church had been there for us in big ways.
DUSTIN LANCE BLACK: [“Under the Banner of Heaven”] is filled with the information that the Mormon church says to stay away from.
No fundamentalists, but I didn’t think it was important for me to meet any fundamentalists for the purposes of playing [Jeb].
It’s only in 2013 that the Mormon Church officially admitted for the first time that Joseph Smith had more than one wife.
I have real issues with the Mormon church, but I have really close, warm relationships with a lot of Mormons.
