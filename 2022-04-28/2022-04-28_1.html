     Thomas Tuchel Explains Chelsea Team Selection to Face Manchester United
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has explained his team selection to face Manchester United in the Premier League on Thursday evening.
The German has made several changes to his team that beat West Ham United late on Sunday as Cesar Azpilicueta and Reece James return.
The line-up features 10 of the 11 starters against Manchester City in the Champions League final last season, with Marcos Alonso replacing the injured Ben Chilwell.
Trevoh Chalobah and Ruben Loftus-Cheek will feel hard done by to drop to the bench after being part of the defence which kept West Ham at bay on Sunday.
That’s why it was important to find an answer against West Ham in an important match for the top four &amp; we must continue."

     Rangnick could balance Austria job with Manchester United consultancy role
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick is seriously considering an offer to manage the Austria national team.
The Athletic understands that the job offer does not impact Rangnick’s plan to work in a consultancy role at Manchester United, however.
After Manchester United's 1-1 draw with Chelsea, Rangnick was asked about the Austria job.
Rangnick is due to start a two-year consultancy role with United at the end of the season, but could juggle that position with the Austria job.
Rangnick said on Thursday that he was determined to help United “change for the better” once he moves upstairs into his consultancy role.
