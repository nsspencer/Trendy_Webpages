    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: In the 2012 NFL draft, Denver Broncos QB Russell Wilson didn’t hear his name called until the third round in part because of height concerns.
Wilson landed with the Seattle Seahawks after then-Denver GM John Elway drafted Brock Osweiller over Wilson in the second round.
A decade later, Paton got his man, Wilson, after sending the Seahawks a nest of draft picks alongside Drew Lock, Noah Fant and Shelby Harris.
Going into it, Seattle gave me that amazing chance, and now Denver is giving me this amazing chance to step up and play.
Denver’s new rookies will aim to emulate the work rate Wilson has displayed since he entered the league ten years ago.

“The whole league missed (on Wilson) because he could throw, was certainly athletic and won — kind of like he does now,” Paton said.

     Seattle Seahawks 2022 NFL Draft Predictions: Rebuilding the foundation before finding a QB
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Seattle Seahawks are a difficult team for NFL Draft predictions.
Seattle Seahawks 2022 NFL Draft predictionsThe Seahawks have no shortage of holes on their roster.
Quarterback feels like an obvious need, but it appears two could already be off the board before the ninth pick.
The Seahawks could also go more in the mold of the current NFL receiver.
Seattle Seahawks 2022 NFL Draft needsThe Seahawks probably don’t need to break the bank in Round 1 on a receiver, but it becomes a massive need if they do indeed trade Metcalf.

     5 Burning Questions: What to Watch as Seahawks Enter Critical 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Reporter Corbin Smith examines five key questions heading into draft weekend in Las Vegas.
For that reason, it seems unlikely, if not improbable, Schneider will pick a signal caller at No.
When it comes to trying to predict what the Seahawks may or may not do in the draft, it's an ineffectual exercise.
Since 2011, Schneider has made 30 total draft weekend trades, the second-most in the NFL behind only Bill Belichick.
In that case, a second-tier cornerback like Florida's Kaiir Elam or pass rusher like Minnesota's Boye Mafe could be a surprise mid-first round pick.

     Seahawks have drafted just 2 quarterbacks in 12 years under Carroll, Schneider. Well...
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That’s all the quarterbacks coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider have drafted in a dozen years.
Within months of Carroll and Schneider drafting him, by the third game of his rookie preseason, Wilson beat out Flynn for the Seahawks’ job.
That’s why McGough is the only other quarterback Carroll and Schneider drafted from 2010 into Thursday.
The national consensus entering this draft was that because they just traded Wilson, the Seahawks must draft a quarterback.
Carroll and Schneider loved Lock when he was coming out of the University of Missouri for the draft in 2019.
