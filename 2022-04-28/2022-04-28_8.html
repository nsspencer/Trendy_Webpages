     FX's Under the Banner of Heaven is a Shocking, Fascinating Investigation of Faith
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Using its nuanced emphasis on faith, “Under the Banner of Heaven” gradually depicts in extensive flashback how their ways became so monstrous.
The performances that sometimes are too overzealous in their manic nature—like how Culkin transforms into complete mania and guttural scripture-spewing.
And while Worthington is especially stiff in a role that also calls for him to be gradually monstrous, Wyatt Russell gives the standout performance here.
Like his father, he can readily claim a challenge from Heavenly Father as just more fuel for his destructive fire.
It’s easy to imagine “Under the Banner of Heaven” without these moments, or in so much detail.

     Under the Banner of Heaven review – ambitious but uneven true crime series
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The predominant feeling throughout Under the Banner of Heaven, and ambitious and uneven adaptation of Jon Krakauer’s 2003 nonfiction book, is dread.
There’s that first horrific step down in the second scene, as Pyre recoils at a vicious crime scene.
The series attempts to translate Krakauer’s sweeping book through the overused prestige TV trop of multiple timelines.
By far the least successful storyline depicts Mormonism’s early days under founder Joseph Smith – himself a polygamist, although the LDS church did not admit this until 2014.
As a series, Under the Banner of Heaven struggles to maintain focus, but it never loses faith in that fact.

     The Mormon critique of ‘Under the Banner of Heaven’ endures, even as prestige TV
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: One of our challenges was truncating this very broad timeline of Mormon history and this very complicated sort of true crime case into seven episodes.
I think you need some familiarity with the church and the culture to kind of get what's going on.
My hope is that our Mormon community, this is our chance to show the world who we are and sort of drop the rope in this tug of war.
So from a Mormon lens, it's really cool to see the fundamentalist perspective, the ex-Mormon perspective, the doubters perspective, the faithful perspective, the sisterhood that's expressed, all of these things interacting.
I think that that's a real gift, and I hope that our community will be able to see that.

     What Most Critics Missed About Dustin Lance Black’s ‘Under the Banner of Heaven’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The history of Mormon fundamentalism offers important context for Banner and illuminates the reality that, while small in numbers, Mormon fundamentalism is relatively common.
It was almost 50 years after the death of the religion’s founder that the LDS Church began the long process of ending the practice of polygamy.
On September 27, 1886, the President of the LDS Church, John Taylor, was in hiding for his controversial marriages.
But Mormon fundamentalism doesn’t just include the groups with histories connected to Woolley or the 1886 Revelation.
This includes Robert Crossfield, the Lafferty’s leader after the brothers became disenfranchised by the LDS Church.

     Under the Banner of Heaven Recap: Hidden Truths
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Under the leadership of Brigham Young, the Mormons were as militant a religious outsider group as any the Wild West ever saw.
And it didn’t hurt that Heavenly Father had told Dan to marry her.
With Robin still in custody, Pyre asks him if he has ever attended a group focused on tax issues.
At the same time, most of what we’ve seen so far has felt too quick, like a reenactment in a documentary.
Since they are doing these flashbacks, I hope they go all the way with it down the road.
