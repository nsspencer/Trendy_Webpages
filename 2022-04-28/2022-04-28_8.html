    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Malik Willis could be the first quarterback selected in the 2022 NFL Draft on Thursday night.
The former Liberty quarterback is in Las Vegas, Nevada, where the 2022 NFL Draft is taking place for the first time.
In fact, Willis’ grandmother is trending on social media, thanks to a mistaken tweet from a major account.
Hey, good for Malik Willis’ grandmother.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesFour players who attended the 2022 NFL draft did not hear their names called during Thursday night’s first round.
Ole Miss quarterback Matt Corral, Liberty quarterback Malik Willis, Georgia linebacker Nakobe Dean and Washington cornerback Kyler Gordon remain in the green room for Friday’s Day 2 of the draft.
This year’s draft was widely viewed as a weak one for quarterbacks, but it was surprising that only one quarterback, Pittsburgh’s Kenny Pickett, was selected in the first round.
Corral and Willis are still waiting to be selected.
Most mock drafts didn’t have Gordon as a first-round pick, so he can’t be overly surprised that he’s still waiting.

     Malik Willis gracious after not being selected in 1st round of NFL Draft: 'Still super appreciative and thankful'
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Quarterback was a huge topic of conversation heading into this year's NFL Draft.
Without one standing head and shoulders over the rest of the class a la Trevor Lawrence, the discussion generally turned to whether teams could ignore the hand size of Pitt's Kenny Pickett or the quality of opponent of Liberty's Malik Willis.
When the dust settled, Pickett was the only quarterback taken in the first round.

     Summary: On what could be a big night for Liberty’s Malik Willis, he had some fun with the NFL Network’s Twitter mistake (which happens sometimes!).
The Twitter account captured the quarterback at the NFL Draft getting a sweet look from a woman by his side.
But then Willis jumped on Twitter to say, “That’s my grandma” with a couple of cry-laughing emojis to indicate no hard feelings.
I love it almost as much as Willis’s response: “Oops.

     Summary: The first round of the 2022 NFL draft is complete, but some Day 1-caliber talent is still available entering Friday.
Here's our look at the best players still available, along with their ranking on our pre-draft big board in parentheses:1.
Malik Willis, QB, Liberty (16)Perhaps one of this year's most difficult players to peg, Willis is the ultimate Rorschach test for evaluators.
Boye Mafe, DE, Minnesota (31)Far from a finished product, Mafe is still learning to tap into his explosive get-off and impressive power to become a complete pass rusher.
As a designated pass rusher, he should find that his initial burst and extensive know-how will provide him fairly regularly with a path to the quarterback.

     Summary: In 2013, there was a weak quarterback class for the NFL draft.
NFL teams didn't push quarterbacks into the first round just to do it.
The 2022 quarterback class will hopefully have better success than that 2013 class, but it was a similar story on Thursday night.
Liberty quarterback Malik Willis was not selected in the first round of the NFL draft.
But NFL teams weren't impressed, at least not enough to take more than one in the first round on Thursday.
