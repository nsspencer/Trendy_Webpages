     F.D.A. Moves to Ban Sales of Menthol Cigarettes

     Summary: Taking menthol cigarettes off the market is expected to further reduce smoking levels.
The ban does not cover menthol e-cigarettes.
is currently reviewing all vaping products being sold in the United States to determine whether to allow them to stay on the market.
Some menthol products remain on the market as the agency mulls how to rule on some of the top-selling devices.
A spokesman for Altria, which owns Philip Morris USA, which sells about 9 percent of the U.S. menthol cigarettes, warned that banning menthol would push the products into illegal, underground markets with no oversight and unfortunate health consequences.

     FDA moves to ban menthol cigarettes, flavoured cigars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday issued a long-awaited proposal to ban menthol cigarettes and flavoured cigars, a major victory for anti-smoking advocates but one that could face stiff opposition from Big Tobacco.
Menthol cigarettes, banned in many states including California and Massachusetts, account for more than a third of the industry’s overall market share in the US, even as overall smoking rates have been declining in the country.
The US agency said modeling studies have estimated a 15 percent reduction in smoking within 40 years if menthol cigarettes were banned.
It added that BAT can weather the impact even though over 30 percent of its overall group profit comes from US menthol.
Thursday’s announcement has no near-term bearing on the ability to manufacture, market, sell or consume flavoured cigars or menthol cigarettes, Imperial said.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday issued a long-awaited proposal to ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars, a major victory for anti-smoking advocates but one that could dent sales at tobacco companies.
“The proposed rules would help prevent children from becoming the next generation of smokers and help adult smokers quit,” said the health and human services secretary, Xavier Becerra.
For decades, menthol cigarettes have been in the crosshairs of anti-smoking groups who have argued that they contribute to disproportionate health burdens on Black communities and play a role in luring young people into smoking.
Menthol cigarettes, banned in many states including California and Massachusetts, account for more than a third of the industry’s overall market share in the United States, even as overall smoking rates have been declining in the country.
Shares of Altria, British America Tobacco and Imperial Brands were mixed in afternoon trading.

    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The FDA is proposing a ban on menthol cigarettesEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Chiu/AP Jeff Chiu/APThe Food and Drug Administration is proposing a ban on menthol-flavored cigarettes and all cigar flavorings, except for tobacco flavor, the agency said Thursday.
The proposal builds on the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which banned cigarette flavors — aside from tobacco and menthol — in 2009.
Erika Sward, assistant vice president of national advocacy for the American Lung Association, told NPR that the measure is "a big deal" and that rules to ban menthol are overdue.
In 2019, there were 18.5 million menthol cigarette smokers ages 12 and older in the U.S., according to the FDA.
In a letter last week, the organization urged the FDA to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes and flavored cigar products.

     In a milestone, FDA proposes ban on menthol cigarettes, flavored cigars
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, in remarks to reporters, said a ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars would save lives and reduce health disparities.
Menthol cigarettes make up about 36 percent of the market — and 50 percent of sales for Reynolds American, which manufactures Newport, the top-selling menthol brand.
Tobacco companies, which have long expressed opposition to a menthol ban, said a prohibition is unlikely to work and that menthol cigarettes should not be singled out.
Thursday’s move was foreshadowed almost exactly a year ago, when the FDA promised to propose a ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars within 12 months.

"The science is clear: Menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health and have no public health benefits as compared to non-menthol cigarettes.
