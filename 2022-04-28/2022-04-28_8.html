     Packers take linebacker Quay Walker at No. 22
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesThe Packers bolstered their defense with their first pick in the 2022 NFL draft.
With the 22nd overall pick, the Packers selected Georgia linebacker Quay Walker.
This was a first-round pick the Packers received from the Raiders in the Davante Adams trade, and many people expected the Packers to take a wide receiver to replace Adams.
Aaron Rodgers surely would have appreciated that, but there was a run on receivers in the first half of the first round, and the Packers apparently didn’t think there was good receiver value at No.
The Packers’ own first-round pick is No.

     Summary: With the 22nd overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, the Green Bay Packers have selected Georgia inside linebacker Quay Walker.
Walker played in 15 games for Georgia this past season.
Walker's rise to a starting role first came during the 2020 season when he filled in for an injured Monty Rice.
Walker showed a lot of potential to be a Sunday player but still showed his youth, overshooting gaps against the run and getting lost in coverage.

     Packers Select LB Quay Walker with No. 22 Pick of First Round
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Analytical stats: A first-time starter as a senior, Walker had 1.5 sacks and 5.5 tackle for losses among his 67 tackles.
Personal touch: When it was time to make his college decision official, Walker put on a Tennessee hat.
“To be honest with you, I hate talking about it,” Walker said before the 2019 season kicked off.
As Walker recognizes runs quickly and pounces on them, he can take on blockers so that Dean doesn't have to.
At an official six-foot-four, 241 pounds and with 32 5'8" arms, Walker has the ideal size that NFL teams covet.

     Green Bay Packers select Georgia LB Quay Walker with the 22nd pick. Grade: B
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the 22nd pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the Green Bay Packers select Georgia LB Quay Walker.
Walker, who can blitz, cover, and play off-ball, should be an excellent complement to De’Vondre Campbell, who really defined that defense in 2021.
But in February of 2018, he announced he had changed his mind, and decided to stay in-state and play for Kirby Smart at Georgia.
He took on more snaps as a sophomore, and finished the 2019 season with 23 tackles and 2.5 sacks.
Walker is inside the first round, often coming off the board at 21 to the New England Patriots.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Green Bay Packers invested a first-round pick on an inside linebacker, taking Georgia’s Quay Walker at No.
Want to learn more about Walker, a 15-game starter for Georgia in 2021 who helped create one of the best defenses in college football history?
Here’s what several prominent draft analysts said about Walker during the pre-draft process:Dane Brugler, The Athletic (draft guide): “A one-year starter at Georgia, Walker played the “Money” linebacker position in former defensive coordinator Dan Lanning’s 3-4 base scheme.
Walker seldom gave up air around pass-catchers in coverage and consistently triggered quickly to play the ball or make a tackle.
Prior to 2021, Walker did not start a game until the 2020 season.
