     Jets Acquire No. 26, Select Edge Jermaine Johnson II
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 26 from the Titans and will select FSU edge rusher Jermaine Johnson II.
In exchange, the Jets will send the Titans picks No.
Instead, the pass rusher reverted back to his original late-first-round draft stock, and the Jets took advantage of the opportunity.
Johnson II took a risk to play one year in Tallahassee, and he achieved the desired result.
The Jets had two selections earlier this evening, selecting Cincinnati cornerback Ahmad Gardner at No.

     New York Jets select Florida State EDGE Jermaine Johnson II with the 26th pick. Grade: A+
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the X pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the New York Jets select Florida State EDGE Jermaine Johnson II.
The Jets got out of the first round with three picks: Sauce Gardner, Garrett Wilson, and Johnson.
Strengths: In today’s front-versatile NFL, you want an edge defender who has some game inside the tackles, and Johnson qualifies.
Johnson doesn’t get to the quarterback, but here’s where you can see how he uses his hands as an inside rusher.
Based on the tape and attributes, I’d say he’s there already.
