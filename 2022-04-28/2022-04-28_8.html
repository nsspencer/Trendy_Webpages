     Summary: 9 pick in this year‚Äôs NFL Draft, the Denver Broncos could‚Äôve had any quarterback they wanted; instead they flipped that pick as part of the trade to acquire Russell Wilson.
There were still some intriguing prospects at these positions had the Broncos kept their pick and didn‚Äôt choose a quarterback.
Trent McDuffie, a cornerback from Washington, is also a good guess of what the Broncos could‚Äôve had.

     Summary: 2022 NFL Draft, 2022 NFL mock draft: Charles Cross #67 of the Mississippi State Bulldogs in action against the Arkansas Razorbacks during a game at Davis Wade Stadium on October 03, 2020 in Starkville, Mississippi.
(Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)Thanks to the Russell Wilson trade, the Seattle Seahawks will select in the first round and hope Charles Cross can help start a new and hopefully successful era of football in the Pacific Northwest.
Before March 8 and the chaos that ensued, the Seattle Seahawks would have had to wait till Day 2 of the 2022 NFL Draft to make a selection.
Thanks to the Russell Wilson trade with Denver, the Hawks pick 9th, one slot ahead of the Jets, who held Seattle‚Äôs original first-rounder.
As Seattle takes Charles Cross out of Mississippi State with the ninth pick, that answer has been given.

     Seahawks have drafted just 2 quarterbacks in 12 years under Carroll, Schneider. Well...
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: That‚Äôs all the quarterbacks coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider have drafted in a dozen years.
Within months of Carroll and Schneider drafting him, by the third game of his rookie preseason, Wilson beat out Flynn for the Seahawks‚Äô job.
That‚Äôs why McGough is the only other quarterback Carroll and Schneider drafted from 2010 into Thursday.
The national consensus entering this draft was that because they just traded Wilson, the Seahawks must draft a quarterback.
Carroll and Schneider loved Lock when he was coming out of the University of Missouri for the draft in 2019.
