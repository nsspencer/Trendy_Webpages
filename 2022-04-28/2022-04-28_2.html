     Eagles trade for A.J. Brown, sign him to massive contract extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Eagles really, really needed more help at wide receiver.
Measuring in at just over 6’0”, 226 pounds, Brown brings some much-needed physicality to the Eagles’ receiving corps.
With this trade, the Eagles now have the following top four options at wide receiver: DeVonta Smith (WR1), Brown, Quez Watkins, and Zach Pascal.
The Eagles acquiring Brown improves their offense and gives Hurts more of a chance to prove himself as Philly’s franchise quarterback.
Oh, and in addition to trading for Brown, the Eagles signed the 24-year-old to a big contract extension: $100 million over four years with $57 million guaranteed.
