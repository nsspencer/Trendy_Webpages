     The ambitious, sprawling Under The Banner Of Heaven can’t quite live up to its source material
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: But the big difference in how it’s filtered on screen is the addition of fictional Detective Jeb Pyre (Andrew Garfield), a devout Mormon himself.
Their initial prime suspect is Brenda’s husband, Allen (Billy Howle), who found his wife and child dead in their home in American Fork, Utah.
Garfield’s work is loaded with si lent, nuanced expressions that counteract nicely with the provocative flair of Howle, Russell, Worthington, and Rory Culkin, who plays another Lafferty brother, Samuel.
Sluggish pacing aside, the show also can’t make its Joseph Smith flashbacks nearly as interesting as the present-day murder case.
Even in the opening scene, as Jeb enters Brenda and Allen’s house, the audience doesn’t get a glimpse of the bloody gore.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: "Under the Banner of Heaven" isn't quite a great show, but it's a solidly good one, which is more than can be said for "Shining Girls," which mostly squanders a cast headlined by Elisabeth Moss, who doubles as its producer.
Elisabeth Moss and Wagner Moura in 'Shining Girls,' premiering on Apple TV+.
While "Shining Girls" seems potentially intriguing at first glance, by the time one has watched to the end of its disappointing eight episodes its light is flickering, and for viewers, it'll be too late to hit the reset button.
"Under the Banner of Heaven" premieres April 28 on Hulu.

     Under the Banner of Heaven chillingly depicts murder in the name of faith
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Despite claims that the Mormon Church is one of the fastest growing religions in the United States (source: the Mormon Church), in reality, like most organized religions in America, membership has been on a steady decline for the past decade.
Brenda, a former beauty queen with aspirations of becoming a television reporter, married into the Lafferty family, described as “the Utah Kennedys” and headed by the pious Ammon Lafferty (Christopher Heyerdahl).
Despite the strange mysticism and secrecy of the Mormon Church, Under the Banner of Heaven is a straightforward murder mystery, without the expected supernatural elements of, say, season one of True Detective.
It doesn’t need additional bells and whistles to make it creepy: it’s right there even in the early scenes of the Lafferty family.
Under the Banner of Heaven premieres today on Hulu.

     In ‘Under the Banner of Heaven,’ a Decapitated Baby Reveals the Ugly Depths of Mormon Extremism
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Writer/showrunner Dustin Lance Black’s seven-part FX on Hulu drama (April 28) is the based-on-real-events story of the 1984 investigation into the murder of a Utah mother and her infant daughter, and the ugly revelations about the Mormon church that ensued.
Worse, her 15-month-old daughter is upstairs in the bassinet, decapitated—a sight that brings a naturally aghast Pyre to tears.
As Under the Banner of Heaven eventually explicates, Brenda’s demise was related to the Laffertys’ escalating ties to fundamentalism (and their embrace of polygamy and anti-government, anti-taxation sentiments).
Consequently, one can imagine Under the Banner of Heaven more successfully succeeding as an in-depth 10-part series or, preferably, as a streamlined film devoid of its unnecessary tangents.
“Under the Banner of Heaven” is on Hulu from April 28.

     Under the Banner of Heaven Scratches the True Detective Itch
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: If “it often feels like True Detective” makes your ears perk up or “murder among the Mormons” is a tagline that speaks to you, then Under the Banner of Heaven will get the job done.
In spite of its overfamiliar rhythms and fancy murder-show aesthetics, there are elements of Under the Banner that achieve something distinct and idiosyncratic.
The most significant adaptation choice is the role of Detective Jeb Pyre, played by Andrew Garfield.
And it makes his partnership with Detective Taba (Gil Birmingham) similarly appealing, a pairing that resists simple “good cop, bad cop” or “veteran, rookie” oppositions.
But that’s also why Under the Banner of Heaven’s Pyre is such a smart creation.

     Summary: The Mormon church had been there for us in big ways.
DUSTIN LANCE BLACK: [“Under the Banner of Heaven”] is filled with the information that the Mormon church says to stay away from.
No fundamentalists, but I didn’t think it was important for me to meet any fundamentalists for the purposes of playing [Jeb].
It’s only in 2013 that the Mormon Church officially admitted for the first time that Joseph Smith had more than one wife.
I have real issues with the Mormon church, but I have really close, warm relationships with a lot of Mormons.
