    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: 18 to select wide receiver Treylon Burks, a wide receiver out of Arkansas, who often was compared to Brown in the run-up to the draft.

The moves increased to 10 the number of picks they have in this year's draft, which continues Friday and Saturday.
Brown, a second-round pick in 2019, led the Titans in receiving each of his first three years in the league.

     Summary: The Tennessee Titans left their fan base stunned on Thursday night when they sent wide receiver A.J.
18 overall pick, the Titans selected Arkansas wide receiver Treylon Burks.
Even with Burks on the roster, trading Brown leaves a gaping hole in a wide receiver corps.
We’d be absolutely lying if we said we saw this trade coming.
As you’d expect, frustration and dismay were the top two feelings coming from Titans fans on Thursday night after the trade was announced.

     Eagles trade for A.J. Brown, sign him to massive contract extension
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Eagles really, really needed more help at wide receiver.
Measuring in at just over 6’0”, 226 pounds, Brown brings some much-needed physicality to the Eagles’ receiving corps.
With this trade, the Eagles now have the following top four options at wide receiver: DeVonta Smith (WR1), Brown, Quez Watkins, and Zach Pascal.
The Eagles acquiring Brown improves their offense and gives Hurts more of a chance to prove himself as Philly’s franchise quarterback.
Oh, and in addition to trading for Brown, the Eagles signed the 24-year-old to a big contract extension: $100 million over four years with $57 million guaranteed.
