     Amazon takes $7.6 billion loss on Rivian stake after EV company's stock plunge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: R.J. Scaringe, Rivian's 35-year-old CEO, introduces his company's R1T all-electric pickup and all-electric R1S SUV at Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, November 27, 2018.
Mike Blake | ReutersAmazon invested in electric vehicle maker Rivian in 2019 as part of a plan to go green.
In its earnings report on Thursday, Amazon took a $7.6 billion loss on its stake in Rivian.
While Amazon has big ambitions for Rivian, signing an agreement for the production of 100,000 delivery vehicles by 2030, current market conditions are rough.
But Rivian was valued at $86 billion after its IPO pop, making the stock particularly vulnerable to a major pullback.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: U.S. stocks soared Thursday, with technology stocks leading the charge, as investors cheered a solid earnings report from Meta Platforms that showed resilience in the face of rising inflation.
The Facebook owner’s stock rose $30.78, or 18%, to $205.73 after the company said it had added more users than investors expected in the first quarter.
That gain helped send the Nasdaq Composite Index up 382.59 points, or 3.1%, to 12871.53 and boosted the S&amp;P 500 technology sector, which was the best performing group in the index.

     Amazon shares plunge as pandemic sales boom wanes
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: People flocked to Amazon to buy home goods, entertainment items and pretty much everything else during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, causing the company’s sales to boom.
Amazon said it expects lower sales than analysts were hoping for in its current second quarter, pointing again to the post-pandemic effect.
Still, as online pandemic shopping growth is waning, the company has ended up with too much.
CEO Andy Jassy referred to the war and the pandemic as bringing “unusual growth and challenges” in a statement.
Amazon is facing another challenge on the labor front — its warehouse workers in Staten Island voted this month to form the first Amazon union in the United States.

     Amazon shares plunge 10% after company issues disappointing revenue forecast
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Shares of Amazon (AMZ) dropped after the company revealed a revenue forecast that missed analyst estimates as consumers curb online spending in the face of economic uncertainty and a return to in-person activities.
The tech behemoth’s cloud-computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) was a bright spot during a lackluster quarter, but revenue failed to offset weakness in the company's core retail business.
Amazon’s net sales came in at $116.4 billion in the first quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $116.43 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data.
In the same period last year, Amazon logged a net income of $8.1 billion, or $15.79 per share.
Amazon attributed its net loss for the first quarter of 2022 to a pre-tax valuation loss of $7.6 billion from its investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN).
