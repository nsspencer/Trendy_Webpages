     Chris Olave drafted by Saints, eager to learn from Michael Thomas

     Summary: "I am going to give the Saints everything I have," ‚Äì @chrisolave_ üì∫: 2022 #NFLDraft on NFLN/ESPN/ABC pic.twitter.com/hLfDOvuy9l ‚Äî New Orleans Saints (@Saints) April 29, 2022Bang: the New Orleans Saints took action to solve the biggest problem on their roster, moving up a few spots in the first round of the 2022 NFL draft to acquire Ohio State Buckeyes wide receiver Chris Olave.
And if you‚Äôre wondering whether Olave knows Saints superstar wideout Michael Thomas through their careers at Ohio State ‚Äî yeah, there‚Äôs something there.
Olave led the loaded Buckeyes offense in receiving yards in 2019 and 2020, also pacing the team in touchdown receptions in 2019 and 2021.
He started games as a freshman and ended his run at Ohio State as the No.
So he should enjoy the benefits of Thomas drawing attention away from him.
