     New Orleans Saints trade up to No. 11, bolster receiving corps by selecting Ohio State's Chris Olave
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: -- The New Orleans Saints, fittingly, became the first team to trade up in this year's NFL draft by moving up from No.
11 to select Ohio State wide receiver Chris Olave on Thursday.
Receiver was a glaring need for the Saints after they finished 32nd in the NFL in passing offense last year.
While Washington really liked Olave, it was comfortable trading back to select Penn State receiver Jahan Dotson.
But Washington has long liked Dotson, always placing him among their top four receiver targets in the first round.

     Summary: With the 11th pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the X select Ohio State WR Chris Olave.
Still, he entertained offers from a number of schools, including Tennessee and Oregon State, but chose Ohio State to play for Ryan Day and wide receivers coach Brian Hartline.

Stat to Know: Olave holds the Ohio State school record for career touchdown receptions with 35.

Pro Football Focus said Olave avoided two tackles all of 2021 and 10 for his entire career.
