     Summary: One of the best cornerback prospects is off the board, as the Houston Texans selected Derek Stingley Jr. with the No.
3 overall pick in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft on Thursday night.
Stingley is one of the top players in this class, as he was a two-time first-team All-SEC player.

LSU is considered to be DBU for good reason, and Stingley could be the next great one.

     Summary: With the third pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the Houston Texans select LSU CB Derek Stingley Jr.GRADE: B.
He played nine seasons in the Arena League, and also played in the Philadelphia Phillies organization, before becoming a football coach.
While not to the level of Gardner — perhaps due to the injuries the past two seasons — Stingley also offers a wealth of experience in press alignment.
After that first season, where he was a consensus All-American, Stingley played in just ten games over the next two seasons.
Comparison: The Draft Network went with Stephon Gilmore, and the 2019 version of Stingley makes that comparison apt.

     Summary: The Houston Texans took a big cut at a curveball early in the 2022 NFL Draft.
The Texans made LSU defensive back Derek Stingley Jr. the No.

His grandfather Darryl Stingley played in the NFL, while his father played in college at Purdue and was a minor league baseball player.
As a true freshman, Stingley had 38 tackles, six interceptions and 15 pass breakups in 15 starts; all those numbers would stand as LSU career highs.
