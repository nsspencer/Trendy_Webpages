     Summary: How could the Steelers have possibly pass on the guy who shattered Dan Marino’s passing records, 39 years after failing to draft Marino.
It was really special,” Pickett said.
This was Kenny Pickett's future.
In the days leading up to the draft, projections of where Pickett would be taken yo-yoed wildly, from the Carolina Panthers at No.
Pickett will be the third Ocean player to take the field in the NFL, joining Oakland Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano, a Super Bowl champion, and Buffalo punter John Nies.

     Steelers are a perfect situation for Kenny Pickett
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: This is, at least, the philosophy by which the Steelers selected Kenny Pickett on Thursday.
20, its original pick, Pittsburgh simply waited as a handful of quarterback-needy teams entertained and passed potential fits.
The Steelers are one of those teams, and they understand that the plan is never to pick in the top 10.
Despite a somewhat frantic presence in the pocket, Pickett is a timely and accurate passer with the kind of pocket mobility the Steelers never have enjoyed in the Mike Tomlin regime.
Of course, we could be saying a lot of this no matter who the Steelers took in the 2022 draft.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Pickett initially committed to Temple as a three-star recruit coming out of high school but eventually wound up at Pitt.
Pickett led Pitt to the ACC Championship in 2021 when he threw for 4,319 yards and 42 touchdowns and was intercepted just seven times.
"I had three average years, in my opinion, and then a solid season," Pickett assessed during an interview with the NFL Network at the Senior Bowl.

     Tim Benz: Let's not kid ourselves about what the drafting of Kenny Pickett means for Mitch Trubisky, Mason Rudolph
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: His career as the Pittsburgh Steelers’ starting quarterback has ended without any losses, sacks or interceptions.
Kenny Pickett is going to be the new starting quarterback for the Steelers.
They’ll give Trubisky a few token starts at the beginning of the season until it becomes clear that Pickett is the better player.
At the moment, it feels like — at least at the start of the year — Trubisky, Pickett and Rudolph are three of the same.
Pickett better turn out much better than that really soon, though.

     QB Kenny Pickett stays in Pittsburgh, picked by Steelers in 2022 NFL draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PITTSBURGH -- For months, the Pittsburgh Steelers searched across the country for Ben Roethlisberger's successor.
20 pick in the NFL draft, the Steelers selected Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett on Thursday night, making him Roethlisberger's heir apparent and the only quarterback selected in the first round.
And, by selecting Pickett, the Steelers avoid potentially making a Dan Marino-like mistake, when they passed on the fellow Panther in the 1983 NFL draft.
"We're super, super excited to be able to draft Kenny Pickett with our first-round pick," Colbert said.
Exciting times for us, for Kenny, for the University of Pittsburgh, and for Pittsburgh in general.
