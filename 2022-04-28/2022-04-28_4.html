     Summary: After putting themselves in a position to sweep the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the 2022 NBA Playoffs, the Philadelphia 76ers fell into a bit of a slump.
An eight-point loss during Game 4 allowed the Toronto Raptors to get on the board.
Although the Raptors outscored the 76ers in the second quarter, Philly still had a one-point lead going into the half.
By the time the Sixers and the Raptors entered the fourth quarter, Philadelphia had a notable 99-78 lead.

     Summary: The Sixers closed out their first-round series by defeating the Toronto Raptors, 132-97, in Toronto Thursday night.
After a close first half, the Sixers cruised through the second half to close out the first round.
Their ability to create extra possessions has caused problems for the Sixers since Game 3.
Doc Rivers noted that Toronto kept the Sixers out of the paint in Game 5, so Philly made an emphasis of attacking the paint early in Game 6.
Between Harden drives and Embiid post-ups, the Sixers outscored Toronto in the paint in the first half.

     4 things to watch in Sixers-Raptors Game 6
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Sixers won the first three games, and now they’re heading back to Toronto, hoping to avoid a Game 7.
Here are some things to note from the first five games before Game 6 on Thursday (7 ET, NBA TV).
And Game 5 on Monday was their fifth least efficient game of the season (88 points on 94 possessions).
In the regular season, Embiid defended a league-high 8.8 shots at the rim per game, and opponents shot just 58.7% at the rim when he was there to protect it.
The Raps were outscored by 1.5 points per game in the restricted area in the regular season, but are a plus-5.6 per game in the restricted area in this series.
