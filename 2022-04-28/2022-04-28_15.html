     New Jurassic World Dominion Trailer Promises "Biggest Carnivore This World Has Ever Seen"
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Although it’s rather hard to accept that any successful entry in a massive franchise like Jurassic Park/World could ever truly be the “final” one at this point, we must admit that the Jurassic World trilogy does appear to be going out with a bang in the long-delayed Jurassic World Dominion.
Judging from the just-released new trailer, Universal and director Colin Trevorrow are truly pulling out all the stops, unleashing a CGI-laden action spectacular this June unlike anything we’ve seen in the franchise before.
Or, to quote the most recent synopsis:Dominion takes place four years after Isla Nublar has been destroyed.
Dominion, on the other hand, has entirely new breeds of dinosaurs running amok in every conceivable biome.
Jurassic Park Dominion is coming soon, with a June 10, 2022 release date after years of COVID-19 delays.

     Another day, another ‘Jurassic World: Dominion’ trailer
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: So, this week is Cinemacon, which is a big showcase that the studios put on for exhibitors (theater owners, etc.)
Hence, a brand new trailer for Jurassic World: Dominion, coming in hot on the heels of the last one just a few weeks ago.
It still looks like a Jurassic World movie, in case you were worried about Colin Trevorrow and company sneaking in some sort of abstract visual art film as the world’s craziest bait-and-switch.
Peep it:Here’s a synopsis:“From ‘Jurassic World’ architect and director Colin Trevorrow, ‘Jurassic World: Dominion’ takes place four years after Isla Nublar has been destroyed.
We’re just wondering if this film’s inevitable box-office mega-success means that Universal will try to cross over with one of their other hit franchises: We’re picturing Jurassic World: The Minions next.

     JURASSIC WORLD DOMINION Gets A Wild New Trailer As Tickets Go On Sale
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The time is nearly upon us, dinosaur lovers, as Jurassic World Dominion is just around the corner.
The pandemic upended original plans for this sequel to 2018’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and the finale to this current trilogy, as it was originally due to hit theaters last summer.
Not only does the original cast return alongside the current cast making for a big uniting of generations, but there is a wild amount of dino-craziness going on here, even by this franchise’s standards.
First and foremost, Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and Laura Dern are back in the saddle as Alan Grant, Ian Malcolm, and Ellie Sattler together for the first time since the original Jurassic Park.
Jurassic World Dominion hits theaters on June 10 and you can grab it on the newsstand cover of FANGORIA Issue #15 right now at your local Barnes &amp; Noble, comic book store, and our online shop.

     New ‘Jurassic World: Dominion’ Trailer Is Surprisingly Spoiler-Free
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Just 14 hours after their frankly impressive CinemaCon presentation (fun fact: Michael Wincott has a full-blown supporting role in Jordan Peele’s Nope), Universal has dropped the latest trailer for Jurassic World: Dominion online for all of us to see.
When you have the movie (Frozen) and/or IP (Star Wars) that will get them in the door anyway, that’s fine.
Having seen the first reel yesterday, I can attest that the film’s kick-off is a lot simpler than I might have guessed.
Commercial considerations notwithstanding (I’m still pegging Dominion as the summer’s biggest global grosser), just because Universal can sell Jurassic World 3 as a mystery box flick doesn’t mean they should.
Uh oh, it might only make 94% of the money instead of “all the money.”Jurassic World: Dominion IMAX poster Universal
