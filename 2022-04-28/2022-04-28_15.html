     Amber Heard Promised Millions Of Dollars Of Her Divorce Settlement To The ACLU, But It's Only Received Less Than Half That
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: After promising to donate half of her $7 million divorce settlement to the American Civil Liberties Union in 2016, Amber Heard personally gave and arranged for others to donate less than half of that, an official with the organization said Thursday.
Dougherty said Heard donated $350,000 to the ACLU "very soon" after August 2016, when she said in a statement that she would donate half of the divorce settlement to the ACLU and the other half to Children's Hospital Los Angeles.
At some point, her ex-husband Johnny Depp donated $100,000 to the ACLU on her behalf.
And another $500,000 and $350,000 were donated on Heard's behalf, bringing the total to $1.3 million donated out of the $3.5 million promised.
The scrutiny of Heard's giving comes as trial is underway in the $50 million defamation lawsuit Depp filed against her.

     Elon Musk chipped in for Amber Heard’s ACLU donation: Depp trial testimony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Billionaire Elon Musk appears to have chipped in at least $500,000 to ex-girlfriend Amber Heard’s donation to the American Civil Liberties Union, the organization’s general counsel testified Thursday.
The rest of the $1.3 million the ACLU eventually came from Depp, who forked over $100,000, and a donor Dougherty believes was Musk.
That money included a $500,000 donation from a fund at Vanguard and $350,000 from a Fidelity fund, Dougherty testified.
A letter to Heard regarding her $350,000 donation was provided during the trial.
ReutersTerence Dougherty testified that Heard only paid $350,000 of the $3.5 million pledge to the ACLU.

     ACLU Says Amber Heard Has Paid Just Half of Her $3.5 Million Pledge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amber Heard has reportedly paid less than half of her the $3.5 million pledged donation to the American Civil Liberties Union.
The former couple finalized their split in 2017, after reaching a divorce settlement in which Depp paid the 36-year-old actress $7 million.
As part of the deal, Heard promised to donate the money to charity; half of it going to the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, and the other half to the ACLU.
However, Dougherty claims Heard has only paid $1.3 million to the organization—and a large portion of that sum seemingly came from other parties, including Heard’s ex-boyfriend Elon Musk.
In the message, Musk told Romero that Heard would pay the $3.5 million over a 10-year period.

     Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial: ACLU Believes Elon Musk Was Behind $500,000 Donation Toward Actress’s Pledge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The general counsel of the ACLU testified Thursday in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial in Virginia that the foundation believed billionaire Elon Musk was behind a $500,000 payment to help the actress fulfill a $3.5 million donation pledge to the organization.
Heard had said she would donate $7 million from her divorce settlement with Depp to charity, split between the ACLU and Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.
But in Depp’s $50 million defamation claim against Heard, his attorneys have been trying to show that Heard has not followed through on the pledge to the ACLU.
Dougherty said that the Musk payment was believed to have been made via a Vanguard fund set up to make charitable contributions.
Heard made a direct payment in August 2016 of $350,000, $500,000 in 2017 and $350,000 from a Vanguard fund in 2018.

     Musk Likely Paid Portion Of Amber Heard’s Pledged ACLU Donations, Exec Testifies
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Elon Musk, head of Tesla, stands on the construction site of the Tesla Gigafactory.
Dougherty believes the $500,000 payment came from a fund linked to Musk, who Heard dated briefly after her marriage to Depp ended.
In 2019, when the ACLU expected another donation installment from Heard, “we learned that she was having financial difficulties,” Dougherty said.
TangentA video deposition from Christian Carino, a talent agent who represented both Depp and Heard, was played in court Wednesday.
What To Watch ForUnlike Depp, Heard has not yet taken the stand to tell her side of the story.

     What Happened to Amber Heard’s ACLU Donations?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While this might seem granular, Heard’s alleged handling of this donation is key to Depp’s trial strategy.
Depp has contended that Heard’s abuse allegations and the sympathy they generated were a ploy for publicity.
By discussing Heard’s relationship with the ACLU — and suggesting she wasn’t forthcoming about her planned donations — he’s trying to undermine her credibility.
(Heard dated Musk after her split with Depp, though Musk was “just filling space,” according to testimony on April 27.)
Dougherty’s testimony also indicated that Heard’s op-ed was penned in close collaboration with ACLU staff.
