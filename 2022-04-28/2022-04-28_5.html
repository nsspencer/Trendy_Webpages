     Elon Musk chipped in for Amber Heard’s ACLU donation: Depp trial testimony
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Billionaire Elon Musk appears to have chipped in at least $500,000 to ex-girlfriend Amber Heard’s donation to the American Civil Liberties Union, the organization’s general counsel testified Thursday.
The rest of the $1.3 million the ACLU eventually came from Depp, who forked over $100,000, and a donor Dougherty believes was Musk.
That money included a $500,000 donation from a fund at Vanguard and $350,000 from a Fidelity fund, Dougherty testified.
A letter to Heard regarding her $350,000 donation was provided during the trial.
ReutersTerence Dougherty testified that Heard only paid $350,000 of the $3.5 million pledge to the ACLU.

     ACLU Says Amber Heard Has Given Less Than Half of Pledged Donation
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: An official with the American Civil Liberties Union is testifying actor Amber Heard has allegedly given their organization less than half the amount of money she initially pledged to them.
Depp is suing Heard for $50 million for alleged false domestic abuse claims she made against him that he says hurt his career.
According to Doughtery’s testimony, three separate installments — in the amounts of $350,000, $500,000, and $350,00 — were all “associated” with Heard.
Heard doesn’t name Depp in the article, but Depp claims the piece nevertheless implied him as the abuser.
The general counsel and COO of the #ACLU testified that in-house lawyers were involved in the drafting and reviewing of #AmberHeard's Washington Post op-ed.

     Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial: ACLU Believes Elon Musk Was Behind $500,000 Donation Toward Actress’s Pledge
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The general counsel of the ACLU testified Thursday in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial in Virginia that the foundation believed billionaire Elon Musk was behind a $500,000 payment to help the actress fulfill a $3.5 million donation pledge to the organization.
Heard had said she would donate $7 million from her divorce settlement with Depp to charity, split between the ACLU and Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.
But in Depp’s $50 million defamation claim against Heard, his attorneys have been trying to show that Heard has not followed through on the pledge to the ACLU.
Dougherty said that the Musk payment was believed to have been made via a Vanguard fund set up to make charitable contributions.
Heard made a direct payment in August 2016 of $350,000, $500,000 in 2017 and $350,000 from a Vanguard fund in 2018.

     Court told Amber Heard only gave ACLU half of promised $3.5m donation from Johnny Depp divorce settlement
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Amber Heard only gave ACLU half of the promised $3.5m donation from her $7m divorce settlement from Johnny Depp, a court was told.
While Mr Depp isn’t named in the piece, his legal team argues that it contains a “clear implication that Mr Depp is a domestic abuser”, which they say is “categorically and demonstrably false”.
The ACLU spoke to Ms Heard when Mr Depp sent a cheque to the organisation on her behalf.
“Why was Mr Musk representing this on behalf of Ms Heard?” Mr Dougherty was asked.
He said he didn’t know but he assumed it was because Mr Musk was familiar with Mr Romero.

     ACLU Believes Elon Musk Paid $500,000 In Charity Donations In Amber Heard's Name
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Following the couple's divorce, Heard vowed to donate her $7 million settlement to both the ACLU and Children's Hospital Los Angeles.
During his testimony with Depp's team, Dougherty broke down the payments made to the ACLU, as of the date of his deposition in December 2021.
Dougherty said the ACLU hasn't received any donations since December 2018 and when they reached out to her about her donations in 2019, they learned she was having "financial difficulties."
Dougherty added they didn't "force" her to talk about her own experience, but left that up to her own discretion.
That being said, he also confirmed he had no indication that Heard didn't intend to complete her donations at some point.

     ACLU Says Amber Heard’s Domestic Violence Op-Ed Aimed to Capitalize on ‘Aquaman’ Press
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The general counsel of the ACLU testified on Thursday that Amber Heard’s op-ed in the Washington Post about domestic violence was timed to capitalize on the release of “Aquaman.”The op-ed alluded to Heard’s allegations against ex-husband Johnny Depp, though Depp was not named.
“The goal is to get this out this week to capitalize on the tremendous campaign for ‘Aquaman,'” Weitz wrote.
“From the ACLU’s perspective, Amber is about to receive an incredible amount of press and be in the public eye,” Dougherty said.
Earlier drafts included explicit references to Heard’s restraining order — in which she alleged domestic violence — but those references were taken out on the advice of her lawyers.
Heard’s lawyers have stressed that she followed her attorneys’ advice in the drafting of the op-ed.

     What Happened to Amber Heard’s ACLU Donations?
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: While this might seem granular, Heard’s alleged handling of this donation is key to Depp’s trial strategy.
Depp has contended that Heard’s abuse allegations and the sympathy they generated were a ploy for publicity.
By discussing Heard’s relationship with the ACLU — and suggesting she wasn’t forthcoming about her planned donations — he’s trying to undermine her credibility.
(Heard dated Musk after her split with Depp, though Musk was “just filling space,” according to testimony on April 27.)
Dougherty’s testimony also indicated that Heard’s op-ed was penned in close collaboration with ACLU staff.
