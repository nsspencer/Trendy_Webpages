     Watch: Mike Tomlin Makes The Call To Kenny Pickett
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: There will be debate over if the Pittsburgh Steelers made the right pick by choosing Kenny Pickett.
The Pittsburgh Steelers’ Twitter account tweeted out the call that made Pickett the 20th pick and a Steeler.
And it’s classic Tomlin, clearly geeked to see Pickett – and all the QBs – fall to #20.
The call that made @kennypickett10 a Pittsburgh Steeler pic.twitter.com/vfFEgf8qF7 — Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) April 29, 2022Only Tomlin can joke around by asking his next franchise QB if he’s watching TV with his family tonight.
Tomlin cited Pickett’s maturity, pro-style readiness, and high floor as reasons for why he was the team’s selection over all the other QBs.

     Steelers make long-awaited QB pick by taking Kenny Pickett in NFL draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Pittsburgh Steelers made their move for a possible long-term successor to Ben Roethlisberger.
The Steelers on Thursday selected Pittsburgh quarterback Kenny Pickett with the No.
20 pick of the NFL draft on Thursday night, marking the most significant investment the franchise has made at the position since its 2004 pick of Roethlisberger, who retired this offseason.
Pickett was the first quarterback selected in the draft.
"We're super, super excited to draft Kenny Pickett," general manager Kevin Colbert said in a news conference after making the selection.

     Summary: How could the Steelers have possibly pass on the guy who shattered Dan Marino’s passing records, 39 years after failing to draft Marino.
It was really special,” Pickett said.
This was Kenny Pickett's future.
In the days leading up to the draft, projections of where Pickett would be taken yo-yoed wildly, from the Carolina Panthers at No.
Pickett will be the third Ocean player to take the field in the NFL, joining Oakland Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano, a Super Bowl champion, and Buffalo punter John Nies.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: PITTSBURGH -- For months, the Pittsburgh Steelers searched across the country for Ben Roethlisberger's successor.
20 pick in the NFL draft, the Steelers selected Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett on Thursday night, making him Roethlisberger's heir apparent and the only quarterback selected in the first round.
And, by selecting Pickett, the Steelers avoid potentially making a Dan Marino-like mistake, when they passed on the fellow Panther in the 1983 NFL draft.
"We're super, super excited to be able to draft Kenny Pickett with our first-round pick," Colbert said.
Exciting times for us, for Kenny, for the University of Pittsburgh, and for Pittsburgh in general.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: With the 20th pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the Pittsburgh Steelers select Pitt QB Kenny Pickett.
The Steelers needed to hit it down the fairway with their quarterback search ,and Mitch Trubisky wasn’t going to do it.
Pickett is that solid double — the most pro-ready quarterback in this class, and a prospect with some upside.
The Steelers, who are a quarterback away from doing something special in the postseason, went with the safer bet.
Pickett is an accurate passer who throws with touch, rhythm and anticipation, things that still matter at the position.
