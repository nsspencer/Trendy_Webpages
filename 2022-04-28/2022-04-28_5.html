     Tennis star Boris Becker jailed for hiding assets after bankruptcy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A London court sentenced tennis star Boris Becker to 2 1/2 years in prison on Friday for hiding assets after he was declared bankrupt, AP reported.
Driving the news: The six-time Grand Slam champion was convicted of four charges under Britain's Insolvency Act earlier this month.
Becker, 54, was found guilty of transferring money to his ex-wife Barbara Becker and estranged wife Sharlely Becker after he was declared bankrupt in June 2017.
The big picture: Becker won his first Wimbledon at 17 in 1985, becoming the youngest men's singles champion in the tournament's history.
He also won the U.S. Open in 1989 and the Australian Open in 1991 and 1996, giving him six Grand Slam singles titles.

     Summary: On 21 June 2017 he was declared bankrupt in London over an unpaid loan on his estate in Mallorca, Spain.
Becker was described by his advocate as "not a sophisticated individual when it comes to finances" and the court's registrar said of the German: "One has the impression of a man with his head in the sand."

     Summary: Wimbledon champion Boris Becker gets 2 1/2 years in prison for bankruptcy offensesEnlarge this image toggle caption Alastair Grant/AP Alastair Grant/APLONDON — Tennis great Boris Becker was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison on Friday for illicitly transferring large amounts of money and hiding assets after he was declared bankrupt.
The three-time Wimbledon champion was convicted earlier this month on four charges under the Insolvency Act and had faced a maximum sentence of seven years in prison.
The jury at Southwark Crown Court in London acquitted him on 20 other counts, including charges that he failed to hand over his many awards, including two Wimbledon trophies and an Olympic gold medal.
Becker, wearing a striped tie in Wimbledon's purple and green colors, walked into the courthouse hand in hand with girlfriend Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro.
The six-time Grand Slam champion has denied all the charges, saying he had cooperated with trustees tasked with securing his assets — even offering up his wedding ring — and had acted on expert advice.

The three-time Wimbledon champion was convicted earlier this month on four charges under the Insolvency Act and had faced a maximum sentence of seven years in prison.
Judge Deborah Taylor announced the sentence after hearing arguments from both the prosecutor and Becker’s attorney.
Becker, wearing a striped tie in Wimbledon’s purple and green colors, walked into the courthouse hand in hand with girlfriend Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro.
Becker, he told the court, has experienced “public humiliation” and has no future earnings potential.

     Boris Becker sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail over bankruptcy charges
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: (CNN) Six-time grand slam champion Boris Becker was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail on Friday for flouting the terms of his bankruptcy in 2017, according to the UK's Insolvency Service.
During the sentencing at London's Southwark Crown Court, Becker, supported by partner Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro, wore a grey suit, white shirt and a striped tie in the Wimbledon colors of green and purple.
"You have not shown remorse, acceptance of your guilt and have sought to distance yourself from your offending and your bankruptcy.
"Today's verdict confirms that Boris Becker failed to comply with his legal obligation to declare significant assets in his bankruptcy," said Dean Beale, chief executive of the Insolvency Service.
He has remained active in the tennis world since retiring from the sport, notably as the coach of Novak Djokovic and through frequent media appearances as a commentator and pundit.
