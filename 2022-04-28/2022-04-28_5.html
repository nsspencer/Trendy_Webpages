     Giants take Evan Neal at No. 7
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Getty ImagesAfter selecting one of the best pass rushers in the 2022 NFL draft, the Giants have now also drafted one of the best pass blockers.
Alabama offensive tackle Evan Neal has gone to the Giants with the seventh overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft.
This was the Giants’ second pick tonight; they took Kayvon Thibodeaux with the fifth overall pick.
The Giants decided not to pick up the fifth-year option on quarterback Daniel Jones, so it’s unclear how much of a future Jones has in New York.
But the Giants think they have a franchise tackle, even if they don’t have a franchise quarterback.

     NY Giants snag Evan Neal with No. 7 pick, second first-rounder in 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama star offensive tackle Evan Neal is coming to Big Blue with the seventh pick in the NFL Draft.
He should slot in at right tackle, and at 6-foot-7 and 337 pounds, Neal is the ideal bookend to Andrew Thomas.
Big Blue had its pick of offensive linemen, and Neal was the choice.
He dominated as a left tackle in his final season in college, but also has experience playing right tackle last season and the year before he played left guard.
He possesses the physical measurables NFL scouts seek in an offensive tackle, and his tape matches those numbers.

     Making the case for and against drafting Alabama OT Evan Neal
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: It’s presumed that the Jaguars are down to Michigan edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson, Georgia defensive lineman Travon Walker, North Carolina State offensive tackle Ikem Ekwonu, and Alabama offensive lineman Evan Neal.
Jaguars Wire has made the case for every prospect mentioned above this week except for Neal.
On Thursday, we are laying out the pros and cons for the former Crimson Tide offensive tackle.
Jacksonville could use an upgrade at right tackle or at left guard even after all the moves they made this offseason like re-signing offensive tackle Cam Robinson and signing right guard Brandon Scherff.
He spent his first season playing right guard then right tackle in 2020, and finally left tackle in his final season.

     Giants add Evan Neal with No. 7 pick in 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>

     Summary: 7 overall pick Thursday night to select Evan Neal, a towering offensive tackle from Alabama.
6 to Carolina, that left the Giants with their choice of Neal or Charles Cross, two of their three top-rated offensive tackles in this draft.
The expectation is for Neal to start as a rookie at right tackle, with 23-year-old Andrew Thomas — the No.
4 overall pick in the 2020 draft — a young fixture at left tackle.
We tried through free agency with the resources we have to upgrade the offensive line the best we can.

Neal, who was one of the top overall prospects and arguably the best pick the Giants could hope for at pick No.
#, fills a need on the offensive line immediately and will hopefully be a piece for Big Blue to build around.
Joe Schoen also made it clear he wanted to fix the offensive line and one of his goals was to build through the draft.
Improvement along the offensive line was imperative in order for the Giants to begin moving things in the right direction.

     Evan Neal First Alabama Player Selected at 2022 NFL Draft
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Alabama offensive tackle Evan Neal was the first Crimson Tide athlete off the board at Thursday night's first round of the NFL Draft.
Throughout his three years at Alabama, Neal quickly became not only one of the most dependable offensive linemen in recent memory but also one of its most versatile.
In his third and final season, the 6-foot-7, 337-pound lineman was the Crimson Tide's starter at left tackle.
However, the Alabama tackle should fit in nicely in his new home.
Here's a full evaluation of Neal, courtesy of NFL Draft Bible:Evan Neal - Alabama Crimson TideOne-Liners:Huge tackle with special athleticism for his size.
