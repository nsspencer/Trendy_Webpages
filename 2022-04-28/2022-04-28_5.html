     Rangnick could balance Austria job with Manchester United consultancy role
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick is seriously considering an offer to manage the Austria national team.
The Athletic understands that the job offer does not impact Rangnick’s plan to work in a consultancy role at Manchester United, however.
After Manchester United's 1-1 draw with Chelsea, Rangnick was asked about the Austria job.
Rangnick is due to start a two-year consultancy role with United at the end of the season, but could juggle that position with the Austria job.
Rangnick said on Thursday that he was determined to help United “change for the better” once he moves upstairs into his consultancy role.

- Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+- Don't have ESPN?
As the anti-Glazer protests in and around Old Trafford before and during the Chelsea game showed, the fans pin the blame for years of stagnation firmly at the door of United's American owners.
Not even another goal from Cristiano Ronaldo could earn Manchester United a win over Chelsea on Thursday night.
On the evidence of this United team, though, he needs to have the qualities of Brady and Ronaldo rolled into one to bring the good times back to Old Trafford.
