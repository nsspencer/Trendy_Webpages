     Red McCombs Turned Old San Antonio on Its Head
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: My first thought when I heard that San Antonio mogul Red McCombs had died, at 95, was of his house, one that I think he hadn’t lived in now for many years.
The client, rumor had it, was a guy named Billy Joe “Red” McCombs, who had been a local car dealer since 1958.
That alone was enough to turn old San Antonio back on its heels.)
By the late 1960s, McCombs had become part of a group of businessmen intent on moving San Antonio forward, and he seemed to be everywhere progress was attempted (and/or made).
There was also an obligatory million-dollar lawsuit against former executives that, McCombs told the San Antonio Express-News in 2017, destroyed relationships going back four decades.
