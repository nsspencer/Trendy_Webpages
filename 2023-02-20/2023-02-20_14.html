     Colts expected to hire Jim Bob Cooter as offensive coordinator
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: INDIANAPOLIS — New Colts head coach Shane Steichen has found his right-hand man on the offensive side of the ball.
Former Lions offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter, who got his NFL start in Indianapolis as an offensive assistant under Jim Caldwell and spent last season as Jacksonville’s passing game coordinator, is expected to be Steichen’s offensive coordinator in Indianapolis, a league source confirmed to IndyStar on Monday.
Steichen has already said he'll be the team's primary play-caller, and that the team's offensive system will be developed around the personnel, primarily the team's starting quarterback.
And like the Colts' new head coach, Cooter's career has focused on the development of young quarterbacks after learning the NFL game from a highly-respected long-time starter.
Indianapolis is reportedly bringing back Tom Manning as tight ends coach and hired Giants running backs coach DeAndre Smith over the weekend.

     Colts expected to name Jim Bob Cooter as new offensive coordinator, per report
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Indianapolis Colts hired their new head coach in former Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen, and now they have reportedly tabbed his running mate on the offensive side of the ball.
Per ESPN, the Colts are expected to name Jim Bob Cooter as their next offensive coordinator.
ESPN reported that Cooter was also in the running for the Carolina Panthers offensive coordinator job.
The last time Cooter wore the offensive coordinator hat was in 2018 for the Detroit Lions, as he worked three seasons as the top offensive assistant with Matthew Stafford after being promoted from quarterbacks coach.
Cooter is a veteran assistant coach who has been in the NFL since 2009.

    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The new Indianapolis Colts head coach is expected to name veteran NFL assistant Jim Bob Cooter as the team's offensive coordinator, sources told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler on Monday.
Steichen and Cooter have some recent history together, as Cooter served as an offensive consultant for Steichen with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2021.
Though Cooter will have the offensive coordinator title in Indianapolis, Steichen has already established that he plans to call offensive plays on game days.
Under this arrangement, it's likely the offensive coordinator will have an important role in the game-planning process.
He was a member of Jim Caldwell's Colts staff from 2009 to 2011.

     Colts expected to hire Jim Bob Cooter as offensive coordinator, per source: What he brings to Indy
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The Indianapolis Colts are expected to hire Jim Bob Cooter as their new offensive coordinator, a league source confirmed to The Athletic on Monday.
He joins the staff of new head coach Shane Steichen, who was hired away from the Eagles last week.
He and Steichen worked together briefly in Philadelphia when Cooter served as a coaching consultant in 2021.
BackstoryThe Colts hired Steichen as head coach last week to replace interim coach Jeff Saturday.
What Cooter brings to IndyIn my opinion, this is a smart hire by a first-time head coach, luring an experienced play-caller to town who has experience running an offense.

     Colts finalizing deal to hire Jim Bob Cooter as new offensive coordinator
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: The hiring serves as a reunion between the Colts and Cooter, who started his NFL coaching career as an offensive assistant with Indy from 2009-2011.
After working with Peyton Manning, Cooter spent one-year stints on the staffs of Kansas City and Denver before joining the Detroit Lions in 2014.
The Lions' quarterbacks coach in 2014 and the first half of 2015, Cooter was bumped up to interim offensive coordinator after the club fired Joe Lombardi in the midst of a 1-6 start.
Cooter proved a perfect complement to Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford and held onto the job for three years beyond his interim season.
Stafford threw for 12,550 yards, 74 touchdowns and 31 interceptions with a 94.2 passer rating in three full seasons working with Cooter.
