    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON — The song is older than every player on the Bruins.
Is “Summer of ‘69″ a Bruins anthem for 2023?
Jake DeBrusk said he didn’t know if was going to stick, but he wouldn’t be disappointed if it did.
Calum Scott’s “Dancing on My Own” became a strange but beloved soundtrack for the 2021 Red Sox.
As Bruins fans are painfully aware, there is precedent in adopting an 80′s pop anthem as a team theme.

     Another Historic Win For Bruins Team ‘On Top Of The League’
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: BOSTON – In some ways it was a nondescript Monday afternoon win for the Boston Bruins where they surpassed the Ottawa Senators, 3-1, with their depth and a star two goal performance from David Pastrnak at TD Garden.
The Monday afternoon victory for the Boston Bruins gives them a 43-8-5 record with 91 points in 56 games played.
That ties the 1979-80 edition of the Philadelphia Flyers for the fastest NHL team to ever hit the 90-point mark after notching their fourth win in a row with some afternoon hockey delight against the Sens.
We’ve got to be mentally prepared for each game,” said Boston Bruins center David Krejci.
“We hit a tough patch maybe a couple of weeks ago, but we’re a good team and we’ve got good guys on the team.

     Summary: Bruins Bruins win 4th straight; Pastrnak nets 2 to pass 40 goals David Pastrnak celebrates his goal during the third period.
Pastrnak broke a second-period tie to pass the 40-goal plateau for the third time in his career, and then added another goal in the third for No.
Jake DeBrusk also scored for Boston — the second straight time he has opened the scoring in two games since returning from an injury.
Finally, McAvoy chipped the puck free and it made it to Pastrnak, who had a 20-foot lead on the nearest defender.
ANTHEM ISSUESBruins anthem singer Todd Angilly had to do a restart before the game when he began with the U.S. national anthem for the game against Ottawa.

     Next Stop 50 Goals? Bruins Star David Pastrnak Aims For Scoring Feat
    </h2>
    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: Boston Bruins forward David Pastrnak has it in his sights now after another terrific offensive display in Monday’s 3-1 win over the Ottawa Senators at TD Garden.
Only six players in the illustrious history of the Bruins have ever scored 50 goals in a season, and Pastrnak is aiming to become the seventh.
“I obviously haven’t scored 50 yet.
Pastrnak has scored at least 40 goals in three out of the last four seasons, but hitting the half-century mark has remained elusive for the 26-year-old.
The closest he got to 50 came during the 2019-20 season when he finished with 48 tallies — 14th most all-time in a single season for the Bruins.

“I was looking for him all game.”Linus Ullmark stopped 30 shots in the Bruins’ fourth straight victory.
