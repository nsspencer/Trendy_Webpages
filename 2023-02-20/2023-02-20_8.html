    <p class="u-text u-text-4">
     Summary: A 4-foot-long alligator was found in a New York City park Sunday, according to city officials, and has since been transported to a nearby zoo.
The alligator was found in a lake at Brooklyn's Prospect Park, the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation said.
The animal was first spotted Sunday morning by park maintenance staff, who then alerted the department's Parks Enforcement Patrol and Urban Park Rangers.
"We’re grateful to our Parks Enforcement Patrol and Urban Park Rangers who snapped into action to capture and transport the alligator," the parks department said in a statement.
How the alligator ended up in Prospect Park is still unknown, the parks department told USA TODAY Monday.

     Summary: In an unusual scene for this part of the country, a 4ft-long alligator was rescued from the famed Prospect Park Lake in Brooklyn on Sunday.
It is against the law to release animals into New York City parks.
According to PIX11, city park rangers respond to approximately 500 reported “animal conditions”.
Authorities rescue a handful of alligators each year, “typically former pets that have been abandoned after having outgrown their cute phase,” the New York Times reported.
New York City historian Michael Miscione told the newspaper how this might have bolstered the sewer-alligator myth.

Courtesy of NYC Parks/Handout via REUTERSFeb 20 (Reuters) - New York City park staff stumbled across a sickly alligator in Brooklyn's Prospect Park this weekend, the Parks Department said, and rangers captured the lost reptile and brought it to the Bronx Zoo for care.
Park maintenance staff found the alligator in Prospect Park Lake on Sunday morning, in the heart of the concrete jungle, and noted that it appeared lethargic and in a state of cold shock.
The New York City Parks department issued a public warning against releasing non-native animals into the city's environment, which is illegal.
New York City Urban Park Rangers respond to about 500 calls regarding animals in poor condition each year.

     Summary: Workers from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation got a scaly surprise Sunday when they discovered an alligator in a Brooklyn's Prospect Park, according to the department.
A park maintenance staff member spotted the gator in Prospect Park Lake, said department spokesman Dan Kastanis.
No one was harmed, but the Department of Parks emphasized the danger of releasing non-indigenous animals in City parks.
"In addition to the potential danger to park goers this could have caused, releasing non-indigenous animals or unwanted pets can lead to the elimination of native species and unhealthy water quality."
